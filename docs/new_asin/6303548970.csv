677595,5,6303548970,"Just a quick note for those who may not investigate videos because of the presenter's voice. I agree that there are certain 'sounds' from a voice that may inspire some while others grate against us.
Either way, I have often tired of hearing the verbiage of almost any of the videos I have, and have simply turned down the volume and replaced my own 'heavy metal' sounds on some days...and 'soothing environmentals' on others.
Obviously I need not point out, that I do this once I have 'heard' the instructions and recognize the upcoming exercise...Hope this helps those who would miss a lot of awesome messages.  Maria",1003968000,,618,4.775700934579439
677758,5,6303548970,Prepare for challenge that is as gentle or deep as you need it to be...this video has kicked my but for about 10 years now.  I used it daily On DVD til I wore the DVD out. So glad to find it streaming. Classic!!!,1493683200,,212,3.8181818181818183
677759,5,6303548970,Previously owned this DVD and it was spent so I repurchased another one.  :) I'm a vinyasa flow girl and I love the fluidity in this DVD.  Bummed I didn't check out Bryan Kest's yoga studio when I lived in Santa Monica.,1493164800,,219,4.190476190476191
677760,5,6303548970,Love love love these videos! I've been doing the same videos for 20 years now. It does the job! I feel fantastic and Younger and alive. I of course have everything memorized by now. Lol And now I can watch it from my smart tv. Very cool.,1492560000,,237,4.0638297872340425

677763,5,6303548970,"The clothing is dated, but not the technique.  I was extremely impressed.  This was probably originally on VHS, but if you can get past that aspect of the video quality, it is a great set of videos.  I bought this for less than the actual shipping cost, so I'm definitely not complaining about the price.",1487980800,,304,4.490909090909091

677868,5,6303548970,"One of my very favorite yoga practices.  I highly recommend -- it's fast paced, so good workout.  Well cued and love the encouragement to ""be where you're at""  and ""there's no perfect pose""",1483833600,,189,4.666666666666667
677869,5,6303548970,My favorite Yoga DVD. Not only does it improve flexibility but also strength which is important in my field of work.,1483315200,,116,4.571428571428571

677871,3,6303548970,I thought the classes were pretty good. It was filmed in the 90's and the students are look like super thin flexible dancers. It helps to know some yoga prior to trying the classes. Not too many modifications for beginners.,1480982400,,223,4.6
677872,5,6303548970,Amazing workout and well made video.,1480723200,,36,5.166666666666667
677873,5,6303548970,"I should start by saying that I'm somewhat partial to this set because these classes were my introduction to yoga about 15 years ago.  That being said, while I've tried others, I keep coming back to them for an addition to class and when I've slacked off for a few months (okay, a couple of years) and want to get back into regular classes but know I could barely make it through an Ashtanga class.  Nothing works for me like the mindful yet physically challenging classes offered here.  Bryan Kest talks about maintaining the breath, focus,non-judgment and other yoga principles, reminding me of why I'm actually doing yoga vs. just another exercise all the while taking the class through a flow series of poses that are challenging but doable for the beginner and still worthwhile for the intermediate yogi.  I highly recommend this!",1478131200,4,835,4.818181818181818
677874,5,6303548970,I love these three videos.  Amazing yoga at home.  I like a challenge and these provide that.,1477612800,,93,4.411764705882353
677875,5,6303548970,This is a great 3 part series of yoga practices. The fact that Bryan Kest struts around in some faded denim shorts doesn't detract from the workouts.,1476230400,,149,4.555555555555555

677949,1,6303548970,Not a fan of this.  It's like some weird early 90's infomercial or something.  I just couldn't get into it.  Felt like a bunch of 90's soap opera actors decided to make a yoga DVD.  Weird.,1472515200,,188,4.138888888888889
677950,5,6303548970,"I just started getting into yoga and going to classes. Before I went to yoga classes, I tried a couple of dvds out so I could learn and not be completely lost in class. This DVD helped me a whole lot. It's not for someone who isn't already in pretty good shape, so if you're looking for something easy, this isn't it.",1472256000,,317,4.129032258064516
677951,5,6303548970,"I just started yoga this summer and used this series to help me begin my practice.  I have downloaded a few others and have found that this particular series is one of the best in terms of a true beginner/intermediate yoga class.  I highly recommend buying this series if you are looking to get in a class at home and still sweat, tone, relax.",1471737600,,343,4.34375
677952,4,6303548970,"Ok, I laughed for about the first 5 minutes of this DVD because it looks like it was made in 1992, the instructor's cut off denim and hair style reminded me of something from an old Seinfeld episode, and it almost looked like it was going to turn into a cheesy old adult film for a while there.  I really despise when yoga videos force you to watch an introductory discussion on what the class is going to accomplish before they let you do the class -- if you own the video, one time is MORE than enough.  However, once I finally got into the class, I actually found that I enjoyed the sequences and flow.  I am an intermediate yogi, so I didn't really need to look up at the video too much, unless I wanted to double check my form or something else.  I didn't mind some of his motivational mind/body talk either, which I'm usually not too into.  I will continue to use this.  But the outdated outfits and his shirtlessness & hairdo are pretty cheese.",1470700800,,951,4.284916201117318

677954,4,6303548970,i had a video of this a long time ago and lost it. started borrowing this through the library and decided to purchase again. i enjoy this video. even though the first chapter is like a instructional video. keep doing it completely until you can get though the whole thing and you'll be ready for the second video. i was doing this video twice and day for months until i could get though it to the end and it made me feel really proud of myself.,1469318400,,444,4.174418604651163

678028,3,6303548970,"This might be good if you first start to learn the movement. For daily practice, I would like a video that is clean, helping me to focus, with good background music. The instructors voice is thing and weak, with a lot of irrelevant talking referring to the student or something else. It is distracting and annoying.

678031,5,6303548970,"I really like the pace, and Krest's encouragement. I have a real bad back, so I have not made it through the first session, but I keep progressing a few minutes at a time. My back is improving and I feel much stronger. I am hoping to get to session 3, but at this rate it is quite a way off.",1467072000,,291,3.7868852459016393
678032,5,6303548970,"This is a really good DVD. I hesitated for a long time before buying it, because I wasn't sure I could get past the old look and production value. It's true, sometimes in the DVD he is hard to hear, because he's walking around the class and it just doesn't pick up everything he's saying very well, but after you get to know the routine, it's fine. And yes, I confess to giggling joyfully every time I see him cast soulful eyes at me in the intro. But the substance really is there. I always appreciate hearing different instructors' takes on the poses, you can get something different from each one and really expand your experience, and in this way he has definitely added value to my yoga practice. It's also nice to have 3 workouts that are fairly short - just around an hour each - but really give you a good workout. These will certainly be a permanent part of my DVD rotation.",1467072000,,883,4.357575757575757

678036,5,6303548970,"I have been doing this work out for years. Even the first level (this one) is challenging.  To put that in perspective for workouts I typically swim (~1 mile) and bike (1 hour /16 miles). I used to be a marathon runner but have since stopped due to injuries, etc. I'm 41yo.  I like the fluidity of the workout and combination of strength and stretching.

678037,5,6303548970,"Much better than most yoga DVD's designed for home practice, if you like a more vigorous style.

678238,5,6303548970,"I have practiced yoga on and off for several years, and recently started a home yoga practice. I got several yoga DVDs, and this was one of them. I love it! It's power yoga, so know that going in. There are three workouts on this DVD, which is great: levels 1, 2 and 3. I have done 2 and 3 (not 1) and I think 2 may actually be harder than 3 because you're holding the poses for longer. 3 moves quicker and has you doing a lot of poses. Both 2 and 3 challenged my balance and my flexibility, and I absolutely felt it the next day. Again, I loved it.

Bryan is a great instructor, and has a great, calming presence. He provides constant tips (pull your belly to your spine, tighten up your back leg, etc.) which I find very helpful. He also gives basic instruction as to what you should be thinking of in each pose (front leg at a 90 degree angle, back leg straight, belly pulled in, etc.) -- again, very helpful. It also shows him doing each pose so you know what it should look like. It's not a beginners DVD but if you have some background in yoga you'll be able to keep up. The only real criticism I have is he doesn't use the Sanskrit names for the poses. I like to know the true names of the poses as I'm doing them (I can't remember all of them off the top of my head), so I wish he did that. Otherwise, I'm very pleased.",1453161600,8,1327,4.026515151515151

So many things in the disc strike a nerve. The cover reminds me of a Tim Burton Batman movie. Early 90s. The disc has him flicking his hair around in little odd vinettes before the DVD which has nothing to do with yoga. Just him doing some weird modeling monologue.

I owned one of Bryan's VHS tapes years ago and was happy to find this compilation on Amazon. Bryan's sequences are unique and challenging. His verbal instructions on the why and how, at least for me, are motivating and provide a deeper level of understanding in the practice of yoga.  Once I have mastered this series, I'm moving on to the videos on his website.",1432944000,6,482,4.344444444444444
678306,4,6303548970,"I have been doing P90X yoga (1 and 2) for a few years now and was looking for a similar, new challenge to shake it up. I tried a few other DVD's that were suggested but didn't like them. I actually really like this one! It's similar in how challenging it is, with some challenging moves that are new for me and can't quite do yet (which is good because it gives me something to work on). My only problem with the workouts is I feel they are a little TOO short at just over 50 minutes. I wish they were a little longer to give some more time to warm up. I think if I had a little more warm up time, I could do some of the harder moves, but they just feel impossible without a proper warmup. If it was just extended maybe 10 more minutes, it would be perfection. I get the sense that the people on the videos warmed up a lot before the start of the video. Other than that it's great. The workouts do get progressively harder, but even the first one is a really good challenge.",1432857600,3,974,4.025773195876289
678370,4,6303548970,"This video has a number of strengths and, of course, a weakness.

First, the strengths. The instruction is very good. I think the way Bryan walks students through the moves is the best I have had in a yoga video. I learned more about the proper way to move into poses, hold the poses, what they are for, how they will help, etc. than from any other one Ive used. Bryan also discusses the proper feeling from each pose and how to stretch further or, if you cannot go so far, he lets you know that it is ok and to only go as far as feels comfortable. Ive only gone through it one time, but Ive learned a lot already and cant wait to go through it again. Another strength is that since he coaches you through each move so well, I pushed myself a little further and afterwards I really felt like I had a decent workout.

Probably the most notable disadvantage to this video is the quality of the picture. Im sure it is not HD, so its not the clearest you can get. However, while practicing yoga and following along, you probably won't spend a whole lot of time watching since you will be in the poses. I think the value gained from the coaching and the way Bryan seems to care that you are doing things correctly, rather than looking good, certainly goes a long way to make up for the video quality.

Based on this one, I plan to purchase one of the other two videos down the road. By the way, if you are a beginner, this one should be fine since Bryan instructs you how to perform the poses correctly and that you do not need to go as far as the people in the video.

I give this five stars for content and instruction quality, but have to lower it to four because of the picture quality.",1430956800,6,1685,4.159509202453988

I have tried a lot of other yoga workouts including Shiva Rea, Jillian Michaels, and Rodney Yee, and every time I just have to come back to this one. I LOVE how Bryan Kest talks you through the poses. In a lot of other yoga videos, I see either a detached person throwing around fancy yoga names on the beach or someone in a gym trying to show off their abs. This one has neither of those. In this video, Bryan uses positive encouragement as well as principles of fitness. He ENCOURAGES his viewers and acknowledges that he has an audience that can't always make the poses like he does, rather than just pretending like everybody is at his level.
All of the workouts on the dvd are somewhat challenging, but I would recommend this dvd to everyone who's interested in yoga - even beginners. I started with this dvd and it was perfect for me.",1429833600,3,926,4.421052631578948

This is not an easy set of videos by any stretch of the imagination however Bryan Kest leads the class (and you) through all the poses with great instruction and attention to detail. You feel cared for and looked after. I felt prepared for anything with this dvd, feeling energized and content after finishing. Anyone can do this dvd, as long as you feel something you are doing it right.

I also wanted to note one thing I really liked about this dvd. I had tried yoga a couple times before I bought this and I loved the poses but really did not like the third eye cheesy instructors trying to make me feel a certain way.

As others have pointed out, youll need at least a basic understanding of the poses before using this dvd. I love how the deepness of the poses increases with each dvd set. Ive been working with the first set for the past three weeks. The first week was very challenging but as you hit the 2nd week, you're able to hold the poses longer and it gives such a feeling of accomplishment!

Also, there is no such thing as Christian Yoga, don't be fooled. Once I started studying the Bible and gave myself to the Lord I was allowed to see what some of the DVDs are really about and that's praising the Devil.

This one is a more modern production with higher production values if that matters to you.  Unlike the Baptiste DVD, this one has three levels of difficulty, so you can increase difficulty with experience.  This DVD is definitely more challenging, even at the beginner level, but I like it and Bryan Kest gives you options for less strenuous options on all the poses.  (And you're going to need them if you're not very flexible like me).  Leaves you feeling good, but you can definitely tell you did something.",1420070400,3,599,4.6571428571428575
678482,5,6303548970,"This has been my go-to yoga video since I started practicing yoga 5 years ago. I have severe issues with jaw clenching and very tense shoulders from mild PTSD and daily stresses. This video is the only workout I've found that I can do regularly without having my pain increase. My favorites are Power 1 and Power 3. Power 2 is a good work-out, but requires a lot of leg strength. The combination of poses really releases the tension in all parts of my body, including my jaw. I love the music in the video and I think Brian gives clear, concise directions on how to do the poses. I think this is a great video for an intermediate beginner (which is what I was when I first used this video) up to an advanced yogi. For beginners, you may not be able to make it through the whole workout the first couple of times, but it does get easier. After I started using this video, I gained quite a bit of muscle tone, especially in my arms and actually also lost a few pounds, even though I wasn't trying to lose weight.",1420070400,7,1010,4.238341968911917

The issue is the DVD structure. These are three 50-minute segments. There are no breaks or scene markers. There's no easy way to repeat if you need to re-view a pose. There's no way to skip over the 5 minute lecture-commentary at the very beginning of each workout. All of those could and should have been fixed.

Secondarily, as noted, the instructor can be annoying, especially the hundredth time you hear ""You have to be where you're at, because that's where you are!"" But I've never found a DVD whose instructor isn't annoying.",1419724800,7,710,4.582677165354331

He is relaxed and very encouraging to accept yourself whereever you are in your personal yoga practice.

I have been doing yoga at home/and some studio time on and off for 10 years. I took a break and bought this to get back into yoga. It is very hard. If you can do more experienced poses like crow and such- this will be challenging for you. For beginners, you need to work up to this practice. Level one is very difficult.

678544,5,6303548970,"I read the reviews on Amazon and had read other places that this was a good dvd. Although it is a bit older, it still is a good work out. Each time a practice, I find something different I like about it.
Bryan's accent is a little distracting at first, but becomes endearing over time. His cuing is well done. He is able"" coach"" but does not loose the flow of the breath. Music is subtle and does not get in the way. The scenary is plain and stark, but that's ok for me.  I usually don't watch while I practice anyway. I find it a good sign when cuing is so great you don't need to look at the t.v. to follow. I like that there are 3 different practices to choose from. I can always find one to suit my mood and not get bored.
This set is definitely not for beginners though. If you don't already know the asanas, he does not do a lot of explaining. Some of the studio participants are crazy limber and do things I would not recommend for most people. Bryan is fond of saying that its ""not about how the pose looks, it about how it feels"".

Most of the time I find it hard to stay motivated by a DVD, but instructor Bryan Kest does an excellent job of inspiring and imparting the yoga philosophy.  Plus he is rather sexy in a ""I play guitar in a hair metal band"" kind of way.

Kest says, ""the difference between a person with loose muscles and tight muscles is that the person with looser muscles has to go deeper into the pose to get the sensation.  Don't let your ego get in the way or compare your body to anyone else--we are all unique..."" Occasionally, I found it hard to watch the TV and do the poses, and when I just tried to follow his vocal instructions, I ended up in different poses than what was intended, which made me laugh, but overall this DVD is safe even for beginners.

Although Bryan Kest does have a slight lisp and appears to have been shot back in the early '90's, this DVD is actually worth buying.  It's beautifully shot and the 3 workouts are all equally challenging, inspiring, and vary enough to keep you from getting bored.  ""Immerse yourself in the beauty of sensation"".

Initially I found the poses extremely difficult, but somehow, over time, muscle memory has helped me achieve them!  I feel incredibly strong after these workouts -- and not to mention more focused and calm.  I've had many yoga instructors, but Bryan (even on video) beats them all.  Absolutely fantastic.  I also love his approach to yoga and general exercise mentality.  None of the shallow nonsense about having a pose ""look right"" -- whatever feels challenging to you, that's perfect, and progressively you can get more into the practice.  Yoga shouldn't be about stressing out or showing off, it should be a form of communication and understanding with your body and mind.  Ultimately, it also makes you physically strong.  I love it; I've found that the more yoga I do, the more physically stronger I am, and this physical strength also translates to mental strength, persistence, stamina.

678733,4,6303548970,"I love this DVD for so many reasons, but I must reduce it by one critical point because the sound quality is awful. There are times when the audio is so muffled that I have to come out of the pose to see what he's talking about. The inability to hear what an instructor is saying is a pretty serious problem in a yoga class. It seems like they have a single microphone hanging in the room because as he wanders about, his voice gets better and worse depending upon where he goes. That said, I really like the progressively difficult courses on this DVD. I also like his attitude: very supportive and down-to-earth. I appreciate his ongoing instructions on form and breath. The shots of himself performing the moves are helpful, and in fact I'd prefer to see more of him instead of the expressionless cast on the DVD. Oh, well. I can deal with that but I really wish the audio was better so I could HEAR what I should be doing.",1404604800,,926,4.327586206896552
678734,5,6303548970,"After using this workout for 10+ years and 3 purchases later (originally vhs, then cd borrowed out-never returned, and current purchase), I feel obligated to write a review.  I make the disclaimer that yoga is a personal choice.... some may want sedate, calming stretches while others may want to move, stretch and invigorate your body.  Bryan Kest is in the ""move, stretch and invigorate"" category.  This workout is not easy.  If you're a beginner, look elsewhere.
ABOUT:  I think Bryan Kest Power Yoga borders on YIN yoga, but way less boring.  Bryan Kest holds the poses for a decent amount of time.  You will get a full body workout, feel relaxed, calm, invigorated AND stretched.  I don't know why, but it took the 2nd or 3rd time of doing one of the practices on the DVD for me to actually feel that way.  I think it was because I wasn't familiar with moves, flow, etc.  After learning the flow, I can honestly say each time I do a practice, my body feels 20 years younger.  I was in gymnastics as a teenager, and doing Bryan Kest gives me the same feeling as doing a gymnastics practice----supple, strong & alive.
Music in each of the workouts is the same, just different flows/mixes.  I like the music a lot. It jives with the moves.  It's more Indian/Tribal..... lots of percussion.  Very calming. Of all yoga practices, I like Bryan Kest the best.  I also like (in no particular order) Janet Stone, Eionn Finn, and Travis Elliot (who happens to have worked in Kest's studio with a similar flair).  All give my body a feeling of suppleness & aliveness.

678736,5,6303548970,I love this routine. Strong and thorough. A great addition to any routine for beginners and seasoned practitioners. It is a classic.,1400025600,,132,5.045454545454546
678737,5,6303548970,"I decided to review this DVD after reading all the negative comments, which I thought were unfair. When I purchased the DVD I had absolutely no prior experience with yoga. I decided to incorporate power yoga as a part of my strength and cardio training. After starting this  yoga, I don't feel like doing anything else again. My body craves for Power Yoga and learning more about it.

Here are few things I want to point out before you purchase the DVD:

1. If you are an absolute beginner, this is going to be hard. I know because I'm a beginner, but I had a huge determination to learn. First couple of weeks, I was mostly learning poses and trying to learn how to properly breathe and properly do each pose. It's impossible to learn and repeat everything Bryan Kest and his students do right away, so pay attention to what they do, learn it and keep practicing. It gets easier! And yes, strength builds in increments.

2. Learn to LISTEN TO  your body. This is the best advice I can give you. Your body knows exactly if the pose is done the right way or the wrong way. Move at your own pace and again, listen to your body. When it gets easier, challenge yourself more. Once you learn the poses, it's easy to follow them without even looking at the screen. That's when it's time to focus on your body and to challenge it without losing your breath.

3. The video was filmed, I think in the early 90's  and it looks like it, hence, the 'interesting' outfits. When I first turned it on, I thought it was some type of session for sexual freaks. Yes, it was weird and funny at the same time and I almost didn't go through with it.  But I decided to give it a try and 3 days after, I did not pay any attention to what they were wearing or Bryan Kest's fondling ways with his students. All I was (and still am) thinking about is Breathing right and doing my poses.

This DVD is NOT for you, if:

If you don't like the instructor talking a lot (I enjoy Bryan Kest's instructions, it actually relaxes me)
If you are not serious about your yoga practice and just want quick and easy stretching routine. (Power Yoga asks for discipline, determination, patience, commitment and constant practicing)
If you need a VERY detailed explanation of each pose and slow-paced workout. (It takes time to learn everything they do in DVD and Bryan Kest doesn't really go into detailed descriptions of each pose. I had to figure it out by watching them and listening to my body, but to me it's worth it).",1399507200,5,2482,4.387799564270153
678738,5,6303548970,"This is the only yoga DVD I've been able to get through every single day for many years. The pacing on the moves, and the amount of talking are perfect for me. I always recommend this DVD to friends.",1399507200,,199,4.128205128205129
678739,1,6303548970,"I have never regretted buying anything as much as this DVD. I got about ten minutes into this ""workout"" before I was annoyed enough to turn it off. Bad hair, stupid moves, no real warm-up, yoga dude in jean shorts from the 90's, there was so much wrong!

I'm not sure who would enjoy this. It isn't for beginners at all and if you're more advanced you realize this will just cause injuries and it isn't a realistic workout.  I had a Baron Baptiste VHS tape a long time ago that I loved and I wanted to replace. I'll keep looking.

I disregarded other negative reviews about this and I should not have, the others were right. Don't make my mistake!",1399161600,6,647,4.330578512396694

So much for the positive, ""transcendental"", ""zen-like"" experience that yoga is supposed to provide. I couldn't relax for one second through all his inane chatter. And what's up with the Fabio hair and the home-boy outfit? I did this workout with a couple of girlfriends and all we did was laugh through the whole thing and remark on what a freaky creep he was. It's only a $14 purchase but I'm returning it on principle alone. DO NOT BUY!",1398297600,8,548,4.49

678811,3,6303548970,"I like few things about this DVD but find Byran Kest too self-consciousHe appears with jeans for the yoga class. If that is fine for him, great! I am not here to judge. I just find unnecessary Byran Kest be so concerned to transmit a kind of ""cool yoga teacher"". I feel that is not necessary. Also, I feel he has some knowledge but because he is so much concerned on how he is looking and appearing on the video he looses he's power. The entire concept of the video feels like showing off.
If Byran could concentrate more on his class and the best way to deliver it, I am sure this would turn into a great and useful DVD for the public.",1397088000,,636,4.137096774193548
678812,1,6303548970,"This video is so so so so so so awful.
I purchased this based off the killer ratings and am so surprised of all the rave reviews.
The video looks like it was filmed in the 90s. The trainer doesn't stop tracing people's bodies when he explains moves (which even though I'm only watching schkeeves me out to no end), and each session is 2+ HOURS LONG.
I bought this thinking ""beginner, intermediate, or advanced"" meant different levels of duration as well as overall difficulty.
Each session is 2+ hours long.
For someone looking to get a quick 30 minutes (tops) workout in, this video was a HUGE let down.
I missed the return deadline and have been searching for a way to get rid of this awful video.

What a disappointment.",1397088000,3,723,4.4772727272727275
678813,5,6303548970,"I have just finished the first dvd in the set and I loved it. I have been doing Rodney Yee's Yoga Burn for the past few months, and for the last two months I've been incorporating Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Total Body in my routine once or twice a week. I'm at a comfortable level where I can complete both without a struggle. Bryan Kest's dvd tested me at some points. But I enjoyed every minute and before I knew it, it was over. I'm looking forward to trying out the next 2 dvds once I've gotten familiar with the first.
I wouldn't recommend this workout for people who have never done yoga. It's not necessarily an issue of fitness as Bryan himself suggests that each person adapt the moves to suit their capabilities, but he moves through the positions rather quickly at some points and some postions do require some strength and balance to complete. For starting from scratch beginners, I do recommend Yoga Burn as Rodney goes through the positons slowly and gently. If you are familiar with yoga, I highly recommend this set.",1396396800,,1031,4.518716577540107

678894,5,6303548970,"Surprised to still see this for sale. I bought this from Amazon in 2005 and it's still the only Yoga video I use. I've tried numerous others; wasted money of other DVDs, random YouTube stuff, and random downloads. In my opinion, nothing compares to this video.

When I first bought this video it was my first time doing Yoga so I struggled for a while trying to figure out what was going on with the poses. Initially I found it a bit annoying but after a while I came to appreciate it. I was on the beginner level for a long time and if it didn't flow like it did, if had constant teaching moment stops, I probably would have become annoyed with that too and never continued the pursuit. If you buy this and it's your first time, don't get annoyed that you're spending so much time trying to figure out a pose instead of being in it because it will probably take a few times until you can actually stay in the pose anyway.

After 8 years with this DVD and a trial of a plethora of other random products,  I definitely recommend this one.",1392508800,7,1037,4.253807106598985

I have a Rodney Yee set and while I like it a lot, this one is better. The instruction is better overall, which is something I still need. And, I find even the first level more challenging than anything on my Yee dvd. I like the more physically active yoga workouts and this really fits. It still has the meditation and breath work, though. I am still learning all the different styles of yoga, but the ones that use the term ""power yoga"" seem to be the style(s) I prefer. I do like Yee's power yoga dvd--but this one is better. I really feel like I've worked my body with set. This might not be for everyone as even level one has some very challenging poses that involve a lot of twisting/stretching/balancing. I could see an injury happening.

678899,4,6303548970,"This is a great video for people familiar with vinyasa or power yoga. IMO, the second series (Tone) is more challenging than the third (Sweat). Each video starts with Vinyasa A&B series, then goes on in a traditional standing, seated, twisting, ab and inversion sequence, with frequent vinyasas in between. It's challenging and the holds are traditional 5 slow breath holds. If you like traditional ashtanga-inspired vinyasa, this is for you. My main complaint is the hyper flexible LA models in the video -- I just try not to look at them because what they are doing does not resemble reality for regular people.",1391126400,,613,4.903846153846154

This is the oldest video in my exercise collection. I've probably owned at least two-hundred exercise videos over the last fifteen years; every time this ends up in the Goodwill bag, I either take it out, or I rebuy it within a few months.

I must say, this is definitely one of the best yoga DVDs out there. I practice with it at least once a week. Kest is a great motivator pushing you through every breath of the way. Although, watching this makes me nostalgic for the 90s :).

679003,1,6303548970,"I had done moderate yoga on and off for about a year, mostly P90X power yoga, which was a great workout and taught me to enjoy it.  I decided I wanted to start from the beginning and see how far I could progress through the level of yoga's skillset. After reading a lot of recommendations and reviews I was pointed in the direction of Bryan Kest's Power Yoga by many. When I received the DVD, I popped it in, expecting the beginner portion to do a light explanation of breathing, and demonstrations of the poses throughout the lesson. Kest gives a very psuedo-theological explanation of breathing which does not make too much sense and then we jump into the lesson. And that's were the actual instruction stops. The people in his filmed class are all obviously experienced with yoga, and he flies through the poses, talking the entire time about how you should be feeling something, nothing more specific than that. He seems to forget that many poses do not allow the participant to view the screen and execute the pose at the same time, nor allow hands for the pause button. He just speeds through the process with very brief demonstrations and rapid fire breathing instructions. Rather than relieve stress and tension, I was incredibly frustrated 10 minutes into the workout. I understand yoga is supposed to flow, but his transitions were much to fast for a beginner, and with the amount of babbling he does throughout, it would be hard for an experienced user to keep track of where they were.

In short, would highly recommend choosing anything other than this DVD.  Simply Terrible.",1389571200,10,1588,4.746376811594203

I don't know if one copied the other, if they were trained by same individuals or what.

I gave it only 3 stars because of the low quality, 80's soft core porn feel of this entire DVD. The production value is terrible, Brian Kest is constantly stroking and touching both male and female actors very suggestively, and the introduction to each class makes me burst out laughing. Again, the Yoga is ok but Brian Kest is a trip. My wife can't even do this DVD because she falls over laughing at his antics.

I'm used to working out to Tony Horton and Shaun T, and Brian Kest is about  as far from either of those guys as you can go. For instance, why the hell is this guy wearing cut-off jean shorts over tights in this video? Why does he make such weird faces when stroking his students suggestively? Beats me but for $15 I won't complain too much, I'll just laugh and move along. Also, if you are looking for a serious challenge look elsewhere.

679229,5,6303548970,"I had the original version of this on three VHS tapes back when it first came out. After I loaned one of the tapes to my sister and never got it back (I ended up giving it to her because she really loved it too), I was very happy to find this DVD version.
I guess everyone has their own personal preference, but I was suprised to see several reviews saying he talked too much.  True, he does talk more than some of the other DVDs I've tried, but that's one of the things I love about it. I find his voice very soothing...he has a relaxed talking style and a good pace, and I find I'm able to follow his verbal cues to make little adjustments to get the most out of each pose. Having him talk through the poses also helps keep me on track without having to look at the TV and come out of a pose to do so. Now I don't even turn on the TV when I use this, I just play the audio. I also enjoy the background music a lot...it isn't distracting, and the beat seems to be in rhythym with my breath.

I would recommend this for someone who already has a decent amount of experience with yoga. Even though level 1 says it's for beginners, it was the most challenging ""beginner"" DVD I've ever found, quite a bit more challenging than some of the intermediate and advanced DVDs I have. When I first tried it, I couldn't make it all the way through...it was too difficult at first but I kept at it, and it completely transformed my body & my mind too in a way...I have a certain calmness, clarity, sense of well-being...I don't know exactly how to describe it, but if you've been practicing yoga for a while, I think you know what I mean. I've tried many other DVD and some classes too just for a change of routine but always come back to this one. I love how I feel with this, like I'm getting a whole body workout, and at the end, I feel invigorated yet relaxed. It's perfect.",1377043200,4,1866,4.123626373626373

For the records, I always thought that Yoga was an ""Easy"" thing...that is NOT the case. It has taken me quite a while to get through the program and not feel like I was about to die!

Bryan Kest gives some good advice at the beginning in that you are not meant to conform to the poses, but due to the different anatomy of each person, the pose conforms to us!!! Also, do the best you can and that is all that matters.

Thought his pace was reasonable. his instructions for the poses are vague for the absolute beginner, but there is nothing that would indicate this is a beginner instructional.  he does not give specifics for modifying poses, though he is absolute throughout that you should only do what you can.  His emphasis on everyone's unique abilities is refreshing from many others who make you feel if you cannot get to the absolute extreme of the pose you are failing.  The folks with him are all obviously regular practitioners, but within the group are those who are modifying the pose to some level or another.  as with all such tapes, one should play it through and watch so you know what will be coming, what will be asked, if its doable for you.  If you have some knowledge of yoga, you can start working with this video.  Maybe you can't do it all at his pace, but its a good flow and each round you'll probably add another step forward to accomplishing the whole. and as Bryan himself says, that's what its about.",1372809600,,1116,4.629441624365482

Bryan's Power Yoga is almost the perfect blend of meditation and full body workout the background music is great (when you beging to know the poses from daily use you can close your eyes and follow the instructions verbally to really enhance the meditation) when your finished trust you will be sweating but you'll also feel great not too hard for beginners also he gives modifications for those like me who aren't there yet and I really like his philosophy of not trying to conform to the pose but if your feeling something and breathing deep your doing it right great buy I really enjoyed it down side I wish it was a 3 disc set,1369958400,,1044,4.358974358974359

Since I started practicing with this DVD this week I really do feel that my body needs this and I have that sense of craving it. I have also found that my other less healthy cravings have started to diminish or at least I become easily distracted from them if I'm busy working on other things (like during that afternoon energy dip when food cravings seem to happen way too often). For me this a really enjoyable DVD and when I practice with it I can become immersed in it.

Each of the ""classes"" on this DVD run between 45 and 50 minutes.  That may not seem very long to a seasoned practitioner; however, Bryan does a wonderful job of giving enough direction within the poses to make you work to the best of your ability and come out feeling better, longer, and stronger than when you started.  I actually prefer this DVD over some of my other 60 to 90 minute DVD practices.  There is a lot of talking (this is pointed out in many reviews), which I thought would be annoying at first, but as I listened, focused, and completed the practice I found that it really helped.  It also, funny enough, made me smile more than a few times.

In my opinion, each of the ""classes"" on this DVD are strong and well rounded.  They flow very well.  Example:  plank, updog, downdog, vera I, vera II, side angle (wrap option), triangle, reverse triangle, back to plank, etc.  Bryan's instruction is wonderful throughout, although his talking may take some getting used to.

If you're debating purchasing this DVD, which I did initially, here's a thought:  I'm sure that we've all paid more [than the cost of this DVD] for one studio class that we came out of saying: ""Meh."" or ""I'm not going back to that instructor again.""  Right?

Then I thought, hey, this is very superficial of me and most un-yoga-like.  Some of my favorite people are from New Jersey and apparently this is what hair was like in the mid-90s (I'd forgotten).

And you know what?  It is a great DVD.  Kest is a very good teacher and it's the kind of yoga I like.  What kind of yoga is that?  The kind where you hold difficult poses for long periods of time, basically until you shake.  It takes intense concentration and builds strength.  It's different from Vinyasa yoga, which is much faster moving.  Here, you have time to adjust your positions, really feel them (sometimes a little too much), and get what I consider their full benefit. It's less aerobic and more strengthening than Vinyasa.

It is also HARD.  I don't recommend this DVD for people who haven't done a LOT of yoga, so they've already had instructors there to adjust them and tell them what they should and should not be doing for their body type and condition.  You can get hurt doing yoga under the best of circumstances, but if you don't have a good idea of what you're doing, you can really get hurt doing yoga at home.

If you're comfortable with your practice and you've done these poses many times before, and you like this kind of yoga, then this is a great choice.  Note:  Kest has cut his hair since then and looks much better now.  And I'm sure he's horrified by his fashion choices of yore, as we all are.",1358812800,5,1530,4.465703971119134

679629,5,6303548970,"After periods of not being able to workout either because of illness or a busy life. I do find my body feeling the pain but after getting used to sedentary lifestyle, usually our body resists the attempts or desire to change and become active again. Not so with Bryan Kest's Yoga.

I find my mind focusing on this workout and craving it, just as some it does sometimes with junk food. I have been doing this workout for so many years now, that I have it memorized and will have words from the workout replay in my head. I have never gotten to a point that I do the workout more than once a week and generally it is not even close to once a week. But I do wish I could keep the momentum and motivation and make time to do it once a week. Post workout I feel refreshed, destressed and enlivened. I do find that relaxing the tension in my muscles is a great stress relief. I have done the AM/PM Yoga and find that it just doesn't hold the poses long enough or something because I don't ever feel the same difference in my body that I do with Power Yoga.

My only complaint is the length of the workout. I do wish that the workout were shorter, the length makes it difficult to complete regularly. There could be a much shorter version that cut out a few of the Cobra to downward dog cycles. So if your schedule is tight just fast forward through some of that. Also for ease purposes it would have been nice if they had inserted stops so that you could easily skip a pose. There are no stops so you just have to slow motion fast forward. If you skip you end up on the next program instead of the next pose. Also if it is just too long I sometimes just do it as long as I can and just stop when I need to, you do not have to finish to get some benefit. I don't get the full benefit because the variety that comes from the full workout gives me a full body experience, but something is always better than nothing.

I read one review that claimed this is not for beginners, the program comes with 3 different workouts and even the first can be challenging, but all poses can be adapted to you and your own flexibility. As Bryan often reminds us that we must ""be where we're at . . . be where it feel's comfortable . . . where you are feeling something but not too much."" So in this workout most of the participants are very flexible, but that does not mean you have to be where they are, your pose can be modified to your own skill level. I just completed a beginner level workout with some difficulty and some poses I can not achieve, but there is less than a handful that I cannot modify to my level which has been sedentary for four months now. I know from previous experience by the fourth time I do the workout even only doing it once a week I will be able to complete those poses I struggled with (except for one that bothers my knees). There is a pose where you wrap one hand under your bent leg and grab your other hand that is stretched behind your back that get's my knees hurting every time so I just skip that pose. You have to listen to your body and my body tells me it loves Power Yoga!",1357516800,2,3094,4.102310231023102
679630,5,6303548970,"I originally reviewed this over a year ago.. today is 9.7.14,  and the TV I was using was too dark for this video.  Visually, This seems more like some ""artsy, independent film"" than an instructional yoga dvd.  The people are all super thin, yoga experts, (at all levels, though)  wearing the same uniforms, they move very fast through movements, he does not really explain what they are doing , how to do it, although he does explain what you should be feeling, which most yoga dvd's (and teachers) leave out, so that's VERY refreshing. He seems to want to teach a very inward, personal experience, (which is good and traditional yoga philosophy) rather than trying to copy the models in the video, which I think is why the film is so grainy, fuzzy, blurry / foggy and dark (unless i got a very bad version) and the camera does not really focus on what the others are doing, so you can really see clearly..

Not for a REAL beginner - It's important to have a background in basic yoga moves, english slang names (downward dog, etc.)  so you can figure out what they are doing.

The shots move quickly from person to person, body part, rarely giving you a full look at the movement being done.  It's not for VISUAL learning, it's for LISTENING...  Since the models are clearly experts, only advanced positions are being used. He rarely offers variations/alternatives for all body's ..  I wouldn't suggest this for an absolute ""beginner"", and depending on if you're in the mood for the very sexual aspect, his voice, the topless men in tight white tights,  and basically doing yoga on your own - with them as company -this is for more advanced yoga folks . . .

This is good for someone with a tiny bit of yoga posture and form, yoga position knowledge...  He DOES explain very well how to move from position to position, (he reminds us to do what feels good and natural to your own body...  so FIND your own variations / alternatives)...  rather than giving proper form and technique.  I think for an absolute beginner, this and another great instructional DVD would go well.  If you really listen and do it, it's great... If you just watch it (without doing it) you will see the variations and alternative positions each and every person has.

The beginning into he is very clear that each body is unique and you need to honor your flow, your breath, to release tension is his main goal (each instructor has their own intentions... )

I would highly recommend this to people who are not easily intimidated, judgmental, who do not need constant step by step, verbal and visual cues and instructions. It's for those who will really do this , day after day, and get to know his ""way"", listen to his words, and feel their own bodies, (who don't need constant affirmation) - go deep within.

It would work for someone who really is an absolute beginner, with another yoga DVD for beginners, like Jillian Michael's, Jane Fonda, Maya productions beginners yoga, Stott productions beginners, or good old Rodney Yee beginners.. or even the Sivananda Yoga (the real deal)...  then you know you are doing things correctly, by learning the proper techniques. Better yet, get a book on yoga... to accompany this DVD..  A great one is : richard hittleman's 28 day yoga exercise plan (if you can find it) or another yoga book, like the Sivananda Companion to Yoga... book ..

This DVD is a great way to exercise for anyone who is willing to watch and do it (listening very carefully ) again and again, no matter what their mental chatter is telling them, and no matter what style you are used to (you can just go slower than he does, rest when you like, use your own variations)... it's about YOU...  so it's a great tool to do that...

I enjoy it now and then.  He talks continuously, so it's very easy to tune him out, but all his words are very important!!!!..  but he is giving very good suggestions on inward focus, and energy flow...  I think if the way it was filmed was more traditional, ""wide shots, "" , clearly showing the group, the person, the movements, it would be much better, since it does take the eastern based yoga essentials that are often left out of traditional Americanized yoga (move, fast, burn, work hard, intense, ).. It really focus the viewer to look inward and feel, rather than copy or compare . . .  they are all great to look at, very attractive folks.  Just a bit odd, he wears jeans, and it's kind of like a sensual model cast was called for this. . . it's interesting...",1357344000,,4491,4.5497512437810945
679631,5,6303548970,"I started doing this series 12 years ago as VHS tapes.  This is such a wonderful series.  I often buy this as a gift but this time I bought a new DVD for myself because I wore out my other one.

I was in a car accident 12 years ago and this helped me climb out of my issues (which were many) and gain a great understanding of my body; I started to learn/feel what was in balance and what was out of balance.  Some things I could work out on my own but others I knew I needed to seek help (physical therapist, massage therapist, rolfer, chiropracter etc)... but you don't know what you need unless you start exploring your body deeply and that is what this DVD (3 different sessions) does.

Listen to what he says on the DVD... great words of wisdom as he takes you through very challenging movements.  All you have to do is push play... do what you can do... it will get easier as you try more and more.  Just hit play!

This is not about just stretching... it is about strengthening too.  Deep strength!",1357257600,,1004,4.1875

I have been to many yoga studio and own over a dozen yoga DVDs, Bryan Kest obviously knows what he is doing.  In terms of yoga practice, I can't complain about this DVD.  With that being said, I also want to comment on his arrogance.  He comes across somewhat as a yoga elitist which is totally not the mindset of yoga.  His strong accent (seem like NY or North Jersey), along with his attitude can become somewhat annoying.

My body felt great and i had a smile on my face after i was done. Thats why i gave it 3 stars. But ive been doing yoga for a couple yrs now. If u have never done yoga before,don't buy this as ur 1st yoga dvd. U would not be able 2 follow along w/his cues and some of the stuff he does could hurt u if ur body isent prepared for it. When u 1st turn the dvd on,u get a sceen w/him in a jean jacket talking outside a studio,then it moves on and basiclly he just walks around a room helping people in a studio. I really like it when the videos r done @ a exotic location. 2nd i thought it was kinda over priced for the grainy video and bad sound u get. Plus @ 1 point i looked up and i swear the video was zoomed in and i was looking @ some guys crotch for like 2min.(Atleast it was a good package:) Ok so anyways bottom line over priced bad video but if u can over look that it is a great workout.

I do know the basic poses, I have taken a couple of classes but most of my yoga is done at home w/ DVD's or at my friends house. I am by no means experienced. If you have a basic idea of what the yoga poses are you can do this w/ no problem. If you don't know what the basic yoga poses are you can go through the video slowly.

Kest also routinely tells you to make the micro adjustments that make each pose more effective.  I would like to knock off a star for cheesiness but alas-Kest is a great instructor.  He is especially great when you are in downward dog (or any pose where you can't see the tv) and not looking at him and just listening.

This DVD is for people who know how to move fluidly from one pose to the next.

TOTALLY 90S WARNING!!! love it. don't hate on the 90s! his style was easy to get used to for me, as long as you just surrender to the practice rather than worry about the dated tendencies. again, i really enjoy this dvd and hold a good level of respect for him!",1342915200,3,725,4.299270072992701

679909,5,6303548970,"This is the type of DVD that makes you feel grateful that you're doing it at home and not in a class with the ridiculously flexible people on screen.

The things I liked about Kest's instructions:
1)  He constantly reminds you to breath properly.  He tells you that you cannot sacrifice the breathing to hold a move longer or power through something difficult.  It feels more authentic to the practice.
2)  He says throughout that the goal is not to do everything perfectly, but rather to push your body to its limit.  It's okay if you can't do all the poses.  Just try your best with the proper breath.

The things I liked overall:
1)  The director would often switch the view from the class doing a pose to just Kest doing the pose.  It was helpful to see the instructor do the pose correctly, in isolation.
2)  There are three full sessions.  If you want a light day, you can do the ""Energize"".  Or go to one of the other two if you want more of a challenge.

Each is challenging and provides the right amount of stretching and strengthening with detailed coaching allowing you to decide where you need to be to get results.  I enjoy Mr. Kest's style much more than any other yoga DVDs as I walk away knowing I worked hard to earn the peaceful, relaxed and strong effect.  Some yoga videos make me want to take a nap and leave me feeling I wasted my time.  My preference is to be outside mountain biking, hiking, snowshoeing, etc., but I'm getting older now and I can't afford to stop the yoga.  The relief from very tight hamstrings and shoulders is amazing, not to mention overall toning, strength and calmness.  It would be great if he came out with another DVD with three new variations.

Kest is a little creepy during some of the poses, but if you look past that, the workout is okay.  I would say give this a try, but I also suggest Janet Stone's ganesha flow and Rodney Yee's total body workout.  The P90X yoga workout is also pretty good, but long!",1336608000,,471,3.978723404255319
679982,5,6303548970,"Let me disclaim this first by saying I sure wish Bryan had been mic'd for these videos. The audio is clearer at times than others, so I'm guessing there was just a stationary boom somewhere. However, that is my only complaint, and, as you can see, I still give this series the maximum number of stars.

My first exposure to yoga was as part of P90X. I was surprised how difficult it was, but I stuck with it, ordered a few more Tony Horton yoga DVDs, and kept them in my weekly workouts.

Wanting more yoga, I scanned Amazon and found Rodney Yee. Wow! How different from Tony Horton, and, oh, so good! The Rodney Yee experience has me collecting more and more yoga DVDs from him and others. One day while browsing, I happend across this Bryan Kest DVD. It was well-reviewed, so I bought it.

Bryan's approach is more personable than Rodney's. Bryan has a small gym full of people performing the moves as he instructs, with cutaways every so often that show him doing the poses.

Bryan's attitude is well-stated with his introduction to each program, as well as during the programs themselves. He continually encourages us to simply do our best. Everyone is not the same. Whatever we are doing is right. If we can't do it now, keep doing it, and we eventually get it. I am not sure I agree with all that, but it is good to hear, because even though I've been doing yoga for a couple years now, it's still very difficult, and it will take many more years for me to get where I want to be.

One thing I do know, though: Over the course of those many more years, Bryan Kest will be part of my practice.",1331337600,4,1598,4.331103678929765

679984,5,6303548970,"These three yoga programs are my favorite yoga of all time.  I originally had the VHS tapes of these and I played them so much that the tapes wore out!  I was very excited to see that these programs were now available on one DVD.  Energize, Tone and Sweat are the three programs.

I had a very different experience than several of the reviewers who didn't like this DVD.  It's almost as though we were watching totally different DVDs.  This brings home the point that yoga is a very individual practice.

I am an advanced exerciser who does mainly weight training and intense cardio.  I've been practicing yoga for about 8 years and consider myself a high intermediate.

It seems the stronger I get, the harder these yoga routines become.  I think this is because as my strength and balance improve, I am going deeper into the poses.  I'm also holding the poses longer.  Thanks to yoga, I am so much more aware of my body and can really isolate exactly where I should be feeling a pose.

Why I love this DVD:

**It's yoga that grows with you.  You can make the practice as easy or as hard as you like.

**No ""impossible"" poses like head stand or full crow.

**I feel so calm, yet energized after finishing.

**Bryan's calming voice is relaxing on its own.

**Bryan gives just enough instruction and doesn't go on endlessly about a pose.  I have found this to be a major annoyance with other yoga workouts, most notable Cathe Friedrich and Tracey Staehle yoga programs.

**The calming music suits the workout.

**The set, that of an old warehouse with brick walls and wooden floors fits the mood of the workouts.

There are a few things to note in these workouts.  I don't consider them to be negatives.  Here are the things:

**Bryan doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  To get the most out of this workout, you should be somewhat familiar with the various yoga poses.

**Bryan usually doesn't give the yoga terms for the poses.  For example with fierce pose, he just says to bend your knees and raise your arms.  It wasn't until I did subsequent yoga workouts by other instructors that I learned the official pose names.

**Even though I love all three programs, I couldn't really tell the difference between the three.  I felt that I was able to Energize, Tone and Sweat in each program.

**The only chaptering in this DVD is between the 3 programs.

**The production quality isn't great.  I think they had to convert the VHS tapes onto DVD, so there wasn't a lot to work with.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It has stood the test of time.",1327881600,4,2542,4.507692307692308
679985,5,6303548970,"This is my absolute favorite dvd for home practice. The first class is intermediate beginner, I'd say, while the subsequent classes are gradually more difficult. I've tried many different dvds and classes, and this always remains my go-to for a calming, yet energizing practice. It's bare-bones, I like to say; no modern, new age add-on's, only solid, fluid asanas and transitions. I feel more amazing after this practice than I do any other time of the day, and there's another upside: if you're looking for a gentle weight loss regime, this might work for you. I've upped my practice to at least 5 times a week within the last couple months(because I've been a bit stressed lately, and this helps like nothing else) and I dropped about 7 pounds. That's not the point of yoga, of course, and you shouldn't enter into a practice with the sole ambition of losing weight, but it certainly didn't upset me that I was feeling better on the inside and looking better on the outside :)",1327190400,3,979,4.6976744186046515

679987,5,6303548970,"I love this yoga DVD on so many levels. First and foremost - Bryan Kest is AMAZING. I love his style of yoga - it's an ashtanga sequence with some challenging poses, lots of vinyasas and lots of room for advance or beginners variations. If you are new to yoga and have NO idea what I'm talking about, I think you will still love this DVD if you enjoy a somewhat rigorous and challenging workout. If you are looking for serene stretching and relaxation: this might not be for you (though you will get nice and stretched out). I am usually sweating 15 minutes into my practice (which I love) and feel great after. He explains the poses and gives lots of direction, which (unlike some reviewers) makes me feel like it is great for beginners and reinforcing fundamentals in those practicing for a while. I go to yoga classes approximately 3 times a week and feel like this is a fantastic alternative to my practice when I can't make it to the studio.

With my sincere LOVE and unlimited respect for Bryan Kest (hopefully) obvious, let me just say I also love how delightfully cheesy this 90's vintage DVD is. Bryan has long flowing locks, never wears a shirt and has a bit of a funny accent. I've heard other women say he's gorgeous but I've disrupted my practice breaking into giggles when I look up and see him make a ""blue steel"" into the camera. Some of the fashions worn by other people on the dvd amuse me as well. I love it.

Running and weight training for years started to wear out my knees and compress my spine. This really allows me to push myself to my edge every day without the knee beat down or back problems. I gave it four stars instead of five because it has a few too many pushups which if done this way, will burn out the arms and won't let me do it every single day. Some days I skip the pushups all together.",1323561600,3,491,4.23404255319149
679990,5,6303548970,"I'm giving this five stars because I think it's a really great workout, at least, 'Tone' is.  I haven't made it to 'Sweat' yet.  But I did have a problem with the DVD that I didn't discover until yesterday (I bought my copy in the Spring).  I, unfortunately, did not watch the WHOLE DVD, assuming that if it played, it worked. I should have view it entirely because selecting 'Energize' or 'Tone' both play the 'Tone' workout!

No wonder I thought I 'yikes ... hard!' when I was doing the 'beginners energize' workout for the first time! When I decided to move on to 'Tone' last night I discovered that I'd been doing it all along and I'm apparently ready to move on to 'Sweat'. I suppose that's good news.

After I discovered the flaw, I did check out the DVD by pressing play instead of selecting programs and all 3 programs are indeed on there, they're just not cued correctly.

So, if you get this and you think Omigod! maybe your 'beginners' is actually the second program.  Try using play instead of programs and you might find it not so overwhelming.

If nothing else, check out your whole DVD before it's too late to return it for a working copy.

Just an aside, I did not find any of the major complaints (hair, music, cast that doesn't represent the norm, jeans) an issue at all.  Frankly, I was concentrating way too much on breathing and technique to even notice hair or clothing.  And, yes, most of the women seemed more flexible than the 'average' person, but if anyone happened to look at the men, they often weren't very flexible at all. I am a complete novice (started this year with this DVD and a couple of others) and I have not had any problems at all following along. Just a hesitant guess, but I'm thinking if a person is noticing hair, jeans, how flexible others are, etc then they are not focused and they may wish to work on that. If you succeed, the last thing you'll notice in the middle of your practice is someone's hair style or leotards.",1323475200,,1969,4.426592797783933

The biggest problem, and the reason I didn't give it a 4 star is that he talks too much.  At times, his microphone doesn't pick up instruction clearly, other times, he rambles on and on...leaving me in downward facing dog for interminable amounts of time.  Just GET ON WITH IT!

I enjoy yoga for the physical workout and the inner peace I have been able to find.  I can even sleep at night now.  So, about this DVD?  This guy never shuts up!!!  Tell me what we are doing and what is the next pose, maybe some instruction like moving the knee so you may see you big toe in Warrior 2, and then shut up!!!  As in be quiet!!!  Yoga is about calm!!  And come on, this well produced DVD with a script such as this one, the narrator should not end sentences in ""at""!  He sounds stupid!  Bryan Kest's ego is in the way, just look at the introduction wearing an ""I'm bad in this leather jacket in this tough side of town"" and it's all too clear!  Maybe that's why he talks so much!

I bought this because of the fairly decent reviews and i was very disappointed to say the least. They do not show or explain every position enough and it gets extremely confusing when there are more than one person in a room and trying to do a position.

Also everything starts to move too fast way too soon leading you to get irritated instead of relaxing you and helping you meditate.

This is going out on my next yard sale maybe someone else likes Kest yoga style and teaching not me though!!

Some yoga vids are not as easy to follow.  If you are a beginner, I would say that this will be challenging if you do not know modifications to the poses; however once you've done some yoga, definitely get this series and challenge yourself.  It's a great workout.  I trust Kest's instructions and agree with his philosophies.  He is not so airy-fairy as to be annoying, but is definitely mindful of whole body and spirit.

It gives you something to work up to and yet the earlier levels are still powerful even after you have moved up. I love how Bryan talks you through things. I know exactly what I should be doing at all times and he constantly reminds you and his class that yoga is a personal thing. So often I think people feel to do yoga they have to be ""perfect"" and really flexible, but Bryan reminds us that it just has to feel good to you. He gives plenty of options for modifying the poses and he doesn't make you feel badly about it at all. The classes run 50 minutes, which fly by! The classes have great flow. You feel like you are taking part in a yoga class, but you are in the comfort of your own home. They have your muscles working and your body heating up. When you are done you walk around with a good stretched out somewhat sore feeling and an awareness of your body. I feel that Bryan makes yoga really accessible to people. You feel comfortable, yet you are working hard and your body and mind is benefiting from that.",1312761600,2,1091,4.2

Unless you are extremely strong and totally flexible and have been doing Yoga for years, you risk injury if you try to keep up with even the easiest of these programs.  He tells you to modify the poses to be easier - and do only what you can comfortably handle and breathe thru, but virtually all of the demos are at the most difficult level.  His ""warm-up"" is no warm up, and initially, the length of time he has the demo people hold the poses is ridiculous although the pace picks up to be TOO quick toward the end.",1312416000,2,648,4.286885245901639

I do love that he has an entire class of students participating in the moves, so you can see what the poses look like for different body types as well as skill level. all in all this is a nice challenging video series.",1311033600,,530,4.105769230769231

It is not for newbies - you should have basic understanding of poses before you even try Power 1. And for those who say it is too easy for them, you must be super fit as Power 3 includes advanced forms - and and he says, ""Most poses are endless ..."" so you can always push yourself more as you hold each one. I like in particular Kest's calm encouragement and words of wisdom that you can apply to daily life. There's no chanting but there is a nice sense of some spirituality for those of us who don't think of yoga as just a work out. But for fitness buffs, it's pretty straightforward so don't worry, it's not really new age-y. As a combination of strength, flexibility & cardio - this is the perfect workout and about 50 min. long.

680112,5,6303548970,"I'd forgotten how intense yoga can be!  I'm formerly from Santa Monica where I attended Bryan Kest's yoga classes for several years.  He is by far one of the most engaging, charismatic, intense, inspiring yoga instructors in the US.  Now that I live in the Midwest, I rely on a multitude of DVDs for yoga and pilates, which I practice 30-60 minutes daily.  I used to have this Bryan Kest series on VHS, but no longer had a VHS player and didn't realize it came in DVD.  When I saw it in this form, I immediately ordered (and at such a great price).  WOW.  It was so much more relaxing AND difficult (how is that possible?) than any of my other DVD workouts.  He holds you in challenging positions longer than most other instructors I've seen, yet the practice flows very smoothly.  He is truly expert at talking you through the vinyasas, all while encouraging you to do it at your own pace, to your own degree, without competitiveness.

Yes, the styling is 90s (so what) and the music is pretty bland.  The participants in the on-screen class are all ridiculously flexible and strong, and come off as yoga zombies -- not all that appealing.  But Bryan makes up for it, and afterwards, I feel like a cooked noodle (in a good way) and don't feel as compelled to run out and find time for cardio on top of it all.  Great stuff.  Highly recommend (though perhaps not for very, very beginners to yoga).",1309478400,4,1397,4.448818897637795

Low price for 3 videos
Challenging sequences
Good cues

Cons
Outdated style (I don't really care)

Pros:
Very thorough and each of the levels can be tweaked to suit your ability and mood. The ""Sweat"" routine (Level 3) is very challenging, and the one I enjoy the most.
Each routine works you from head to toe - a total body workout.

Cons:
Bryan Kest talks a lot. Sometimes it doesn't bother me, sometimes, when it does, I force myself to tune him out, which is good mental practice.
Each of the routines is about 50 minutes long and sometimes you just wish he had one short routine for those days when you are in a hurry. I have several DVDs with shorter routines, so that's not a real issue, but a matrix or similar option within this one would have been nice.

In the other hand, Bryan Kest has other people with him in the class to look at.  I had done this dvd the 1st and 2nd part.  The instructor seems to care for the person using the dvd.  He gives clear instructions and he shows proper form all the way.  He also shows substitutions for hard position in case the student is not too flexible.

I have done yoga videos and yoga classes (in college and at gyms) for years now so I didn't think of myself as a beginner but closer to intermediate. I found this video much more challenging than I had expected - which I loved! Initially there were several poses I could not hold and would end up very sore the next day. However, after a few repeats of the workout, I felt stronger and more flexible than ever. I now feel comfortable with the Power 1 class and am working on building up my strength and flexibility in Power 2. I have not tried Power 3 yet but am excited to try it soon. I also have to note how great all the upper body activity is. Many yoga classes/videos I've had tend to focus on everything but the upper body so that has been a great plus to this video.

I like Mr. Kest's approach of providing advanced challenges, yet asking you to be personally responsible for what is reasonable for your own body to do. Pacing has always been important to me and I think the pace is good. You stay active enough to get and stay hot, but hold critical poses long enough to find our balance and really feel the benefits of the pose. Of course there are always some poses I would love to hold longer, so that's when I pause :). Overall, the pacing is very good.

As far as the way the DVD is set-up: you can skip to each of the 3 workout which is great, but there is an introduction that plays before each one so I always have to fast forward through that. Would be nice to skip directly to the beginning of the workout.

So all in all, I really love the content of these workouts and what they have done for me. I wish Bryan Kest would redo this exact video with modern music and visuals, but since that's not what really matters, I am happy to give it 5 stars.",1290124800,3,1977,4.20844327176781

680331,2,6303548970,"Not for beginners.  If you are the kind of person who needs a pleasant environment to do yoga, this video may be a bad choice.  If you aren't easily distracted, it might be a good one.

The actual routines are challenging, diverse, and well-planned.  There is a nice combination of flexibility training, balance poses, and strengthening.  The instructor repeatedly cautions the viewer not to overextend and recommends modifications.  All great.

There are a few weaknesses in the routine. There are poses where he needs to describe the position better and either demonstrate or describe the common errors.  It's possible to hurt yourself doing this kind of vigorous yoga, and also to miss the benefit by doing it wrong. I'm a regular class-taker, not a practitioner, and I'm sure I made mistakes that another instructor could have helped me avoid.  And you shouldn't have to watch the screen to see what to do next - no pose involves a craned neck.

The self-importance of the instructor, his obtrusive commentary, and spotty cuing act as a distraction and for some, may be a turn-off.

When I did the video for the first time, I began laughing at the introduction, which features an MTV-type montage of dramatic music and shots of Kest looking intense and sweeping through a door.  I did the first segment, with my neck craned upward at times, and was really unsettled by the way he wrapped his hands around the student's bodies, especially the women.  He talked, and talked, and talked, exhorting the viewer to engage, but made it hard to do so with all the noise. I completed the segment, sweating and feeling stretched, and thought that I would try to just ignore that stuff, because it was a good routine.

However, I never turn it on.  It's sitting in in player, untouched, and I stream netflix workouts and use other DVDs.  Intellectually, I think it's a good program, but aesthetically, it's so jarring that I never decide to use it.

Rodney Yee's power yoga routines are more accessible, with better cuing and demonstration.",1284854400,5,2033,4.829479768786127

I though my first yoga DVD was great until i went through this one. Bryan not only talks you through each pose but gives you step by step instructions on how to get into each pose moving from one level to the next. One thing that stands out from other instructors is that Bryan constantly reminds you of what you need to be conscious of in each pose e.g. relaxing your face, deep breaths, stretching out even further with each breath etc. The sound quality isn't that great but when you look at the year the DVD was made you realize it was the technology them.

Not the look, not the music, and especially not his nonstop new-agey babbling as he wanders around, touching his students inappropriately.  It would have been helpful as  I tried to replicate some of the postures, to see a whole person, rather than various body parts of the lithe, professional dancer types undulating through the difficult routine.

I could barely hold the poses, but Bryan was very encouraging and, overall, he is a great instructor. With time, I became better at it, but I still feel like I get a great work out when I do it, and still enjoy it a whole lot. Once I'm through, I can feel the energy in every part of my body.

His explanations and corrections help me better understand what's going on and to see what I need to do to improve my own practice.  They do show him doing the correct form so we see that as well.  As a teacher myself (dance), I liked the way he was so physically comfortable with his students with a very hands on approach to his instruction.  The class was a nice mix of men and women, which I liked.  To my eye, there is a subtle difference between the way men and women do the postures, and so many of the videos I have seen out there are geared to women that it's refreshing to see a blend.  As a guy, it was good to see other guys in the class.  The students demonstrate different ability levels, which is nice when I'm still struggling with the moves.  Most instructional videos are actually pretty useless in my opinion.  You can't use them unless you already know the material.

I'm very happy with the dvd - each of the three workouts feel like an actual studio class.  I especially love the warm up and the final resting (savasana) pose, which other dvds tend to leave out.
However, my only ""complaint"" is that Mr Kest doesn't use sanskrit names for the poses.  For someone like me, who is used to studio yoga, it's harder to anticipate a pose without knowing what exact pose I'm getting into.
Overall, a great supplement to my yoga practice.",1275350400,,608,4.45945945945946

I tried both Level 2 & 3 practices, as I wanted to give it a fair shot, but I have to say I was tempted to just turn it off within 5 minutes of beginning it & several times thoughout. But, I stuck with it due to the rave reviews it has received.

To be fair, the actual yoga practice is good - it's just too distracting to actually use this DVD due to the excessive talking/preaching from Bryan Kest about the wonders of yoga & the cheesy 80's filming. For me, simple is better when it comes to yoga DVDs - all I need is clear cues, a nicely structured routine, & an instructor to be able to quickly glace at when I need some guidance. Unfortunately, he talks literally NON-STOP the entire practice & it alternates between a classroom setting & ""artistic"" shots of him doing yoga. I would probably do this again & forgive the cheesy filming if it weren't for the talking. I buy fitness DVDs to do on a consistent basis & I don't know how anyone (no matter how much they enjoy the actual practice) can listen to him say the same thing everyday (let alone once through!).

There's an attempt at being arty that kind of bugged me at first, but then I realized it's from LA so of course it would be like that.

If you have a clue about a yoga practices this is a great choice with 3 works or combined 90 minute. As I mentioned Bryan grows on you and actually becomes very soothing and someone what sexy as in he is differently connecting honestly with his audience.",1272672000,,644,4.070866141732283

These are primarily standard vinyasa moves, with a couple of minor modifications (such as Kest's optional push up in between updog and downdog).  The best thing about this video is that it contains 3 complete routines, which are each different from one another, yet all are very much the in the same style.  Kest's Power Yoga seems to put a bit more emphasis on aerobic moves and breathing, and less on complicated stretches.  It is a good program.  It seems that some people like poking fun at Kest's shirtless torso or rock star hair - well how about his husky voice and what seems to be a Massachusetts accent?  Just kidding - he leads a good class, and if you do yoga at home from time to time (a real class is always better), you won't regret this purchase.",1269907200,,910,4.355029585798817

Ryan Kest talks so much that it's very difficult for me to follow the moves without continually looking up at the screen to see what is going on, which I find disruptive.  He doesn't tend to use the names of moves, instead tries to talk you through the change in position, but I just end up lost the whole time.

Technically, this is a true statement-  however the 3 workouts are all *very* similar to one another, so it's not like you're getting 3 different workouts.  This video is hard to follow because the audio isn't very good- rather than explaining the moves clearly, Brian Kest spends most of the time trying to be profound and inspirational.  But he comes off as creepy.  He seems to be completely unaware of the fact that if I'm in a downward dog, I can't see the screen, so the audio needs to be spot on.

This DVD has 3 different workouts, basically easy, medium and hard. Honestly though? The Easy is NOT all that easy. It's a tough workout, from start to finish, true to its name ""Power Yoga"". After doing The first workout twice a week for the last 3 weeks, my muscles are getting so much more strong, firm, and their shaping up beautifully! I just began working on the second workout, and I LOVE it. It's probably my favorite of the three. I still can't quite do the third one, it's incredibly difficult. We got to ""Crow pose"" and I immediately went back to the second workout, haha. However, in keeping up with this, I have no dbout that I'll be able to do the third workout in no time!

My boyfriend loves this DVD and asks to do it with me frequently throughout the week. He's your classic weight-lifting kind of person, and he thinks this is a great DVD. So it's certainly breaks the stereotype that yoga is only for females (although anyone who really does yoga knows that's a silly
stereotype). This DVD kicks his butt everytime too!

Also, I can't forget, Bryan is an excellent teacher! He teaches in a very calming manner, constantly reminding the student to focus on their breathing, that if you're breathing is stressed then you need to relax your muscles and face and let go. He also is consistently reminding us that everyone is at different levels and there is no such thing as a perfect pose. The things he discusses during the workouts are key to doing any yoga practice!

Highly recommended, get it, keep it at the top of your pile of workout dvds, do it a few times a week and you won't regret it!",1267574400,,1836,4.439169139465875

All the people featured in the video seem to be extremely flexible (more like ballet dancer flexible not so much yoga), and the quality is mediocre at best. It feels like a cheap 80's setting.

The DVD editing, and the video quality can be improved, however.  Sometimes I think due to trying to fit 3 sessions onto a single DVD, the editor had to cut some repetitions, making following the exact movement and breathing a bit difficult.  This may have contributed some other users' complaints about not having enough warm up.

My only gripes would be that the individual classes aren't an hour long (they're about 50 minutes), and I think the ab work could be more challenging. But, Bryan Kest is phenomenal...he is inspirational, but not self-promotional at all. I seriously look forward to doing these classes each day.",1251676800,2,576,4.601941747572815

Bryan Kest is an excellent teacher, patient and encouraging. His program is a tad slower than most Power Yoga practices (for example, Shiva Rea moves a little faster than Bryan and for my tastes too). He also inserts well deserved deep stretches between warrior poses and other taxing asanas. The aesthetics of the production are pretty good, and I recommend this to anyone looking for the elusive balance between the strengthening and relaxing aspects of yoga.

680641,2,6303548970,"Well, I am a fan of flow yoga although I started out practicing Ashtanga.  I do appreciate ashtanga and practice it whenever I have time to devote to the complete sequence.  Kest's video has no flow, just going from one pose into another.  It is like in ashtanga as someone pointed out, but with a big difference: Kest's sequence has no vinyasa, no link between the poses.

But that wasn't the only disappointment. As everyone notes, the whole thing is dated.  Hair, makeup, the leotards on the women, all cry out late 80's or early 90's.  There is nothing wrong with that, but I find it distracting.  The biggest disappointment came when they were doing sitting poses.  When Kest sat down with his toes pointing up, you could see that his feet were dirty.  I know one of the niyamas is cleanliness, and that just grossed me out.  I figured the floor that he had been walking on while giving his practitioners instructions was dirty, but you think that they could have cleaned the floors before shooting?  I, for one, find dirty floors very distracting to my practice, and all the studios I visit are meticulous about keeping their floors clean, so what's up with that?

It seems that Kest has evolved since this video, I really hope that he has.",1245542400,,1246,4.588235294117647
680642,5,6303548970,"I originally bought these yoga routines when they were on VHS in the mid-nineties. I have to lol when I read reviews ridiculing Bryan's style and the cheesy camera angles... what do you expect? The routine on this DVD is over twelve years old. Last time I looked at old MTV clips from the mid-nineties, those looked pretty cheesy too. If you want something more up to date, then check the release date.

Anyway - to be honest, yes, the intro on the routines are totally cheesy but the workouts are entirely worth it! I have yet to find other routines that I like as much as Kest's Power Yoga. Rodney Yee's routines are great but even faster than Kest's pace - Baptiste too. The three routines are similar but different. Poses are held in different combinations and for different lengths of time. A few ""new"" poses are added in each subsequent routine but the base routine doesn't change which I find helpful. Instead of trying to learn an entirely new routine, I can focus on deepening my practice and keeping my breath calm.

These routines are not for the faint of heart. They are challenging for the average practitioner. If you can suspend judgement, get over the cheese factor, and focus on the sensations in your body, you will walk away challenged and enlivened.",1244851200,3,1269,4.635555555555555

However that doesn't detract at all from the quality yoga routines presented (Yoga's been around for 2 milennia - the only things that change are the costumes). The 3rd routine I find especially good, being a very rigorous yoga vinyasa flow workout, not dissimilar to the routines I experienced in a really good yoga studio I once attended. Because of it's older vintage, it's also being sold for the ridiculous price of $7.99. Where I live, you can hardly get a sandwich for that money anymore. I strongly recommend the video. My first copy got damaged, and I liked it enough to order a second.

However, once you get past that, Bryan Kest proves to be likeable.  His workouts are great, they get you sweating and sore the next day.  This DVD is not a great tool for novices, however.  I find myself sometimes getting lost on how to do a move, since I have no background in yoga.  Watching the workout once before attempting to follow along helps, but since its about a 40 minute program, you don't really remember much of it when it comes time to do the move.",1242691200,,689,4.221374045801527

This is for somebody with a basic background in yoga that would like to improve their practice and is looking for a challenging workout.  The videos can be practiced at an intermediate level or modified as demostrated by most of the ""students"" to a very advanced practice.

My body felt different each time I practiced, the poses are flowing, and as Brian Kest says in the instuction, 'most poses are endless'.  The only drawback to the series is that it is possible to be intimidated with the intensity of the workouts.  I still can't do the third video in the series, but overall this series will take you to a more advanced level if that is where you want to go.

I agree that the dvd is a ""good workout"", however, Yoga isn't really just about a good workout.  I find that when I practice I fall into a different place, very deep, very still.  That place was not so accessible with Brian going on, and on, and on... It seems he likes the sound of his own voice.  And the opening shots of him are downright embarassing, can you say Chippendale?  I actually do not recommend this DVD primarily because there as so many truly good dvd's to choose from.  I suggest Rodney Yee, Deb Dobbin and Sadie Nardini.",1239321600,2,643,4.398305084745763

680746,5,6303548970,"I took my first steps to becoming a  Yogi with this Bryan Kest series.  Three years ago I was a die-hard body builder.  I scoffed at my wife and her ""yoga workouts"" at home thinking that it was probably a ""nice stretch"" but not much more.

One day I decided to put her constant requests to rest and got down on the floor to do the third in this series.  I was amazed that anything could be so completely challenging and at the same time mentally centering and emotionally calming.

This series completely replaced my grunt filled lifting routine and panting cardio work at the gym.  For the next two years my wife and I followed Yoga Master Kest through all three of these practices.  My body transformed.  I lost the puffy body and developed a lean one.  I found a deep calm, replacing my old stressed out self, I even connected with my spirit that had been dormant for years.

Bryan's easy words have a way of working themselves into your sub-conscious where they take root and transformation begins.

Inspired by what I learned in these practices, my wife and I became Yoga Alliance Certified RYT Power Yoga teaches this past November.  When I encounter people that would like to toe dip before becoming fully committed, I always reccomend this series.  I just purchased this series for my daughter.  She loves it.

Now on to the DVD . . . unlike other power yoga classes I've taken, there isn't much of a flow - it seems to be more Ashtanga than Vinyasa.  Which some people may prefer.  The first work out is truely for beginers.  The second work out wasn't bad, but not as challenging as I'd hoped.  The third workout is challenging enough to form a sweat, but there isn't any variety.  I recomend going for a DVD that has both set work outs and a matrix so that you can talor your work out for your day.

The part that annoys me is that it looks like it was filmed in the early/mid 90s.  Kest himself wears jeans (which doesn't seem right while teaching a yoga class).  One of the women in the video is wearing a thong leotard - that's just gross.  The filming technique is weird - the white balance seems to be off, or something is happening to make the people look fuzzy.  And the volume balance is off - there is a weird synthesized music that matches the volume of Kest's voice making it a little harder to hear him.  Lastly, he rarely uses either the English or Sanskrit names for the poses - that's just a personal peeve, but it is annoying to me.",1231200000,3,1306,4.18

I absolutely love the routines and flow, it is amazing and probably one of the best I have done (it deserves 5 *s), but I wish there was a way that I could do the practice that cuts out most of his talking.  Others have commented on his touching the students way too much and inappropriately, but this doesn't really bother me because I do most of the practice with my eyes closed.  Unfortunately, doing anything with closed eyes means that your other senses are more attune such as... your hearing.  And while ears appreciate hearing pointers and encouragement - which he does offer - this DVD assaulted them with what felt like constant chatter and only occasional breaks.  It is almost impossible for me to do this practice and feel peace because my brain is constantly trying to tune out the unnecessary chatter.  I prefer a more calm and quiet environment to do yoga, and I realize from the amount of 5 *s that I am in the minority, but hopefully my review will help someone. :)

From the first time I did the first video in this series, a few months after my fourth child was born, I understood it completely.  Bryan Kest's cuing is clear and easy to follow, and he gives exactly the right amount of detail on how to do each pose.  I could tell what the pose was supposed to look and more importantly feel like, and I understood how to modify poses that were too challenging.  To my surprise, the most useful part to me was the breathing.  It teaches you how to be in the moment without judging the moment, a skill that is fundamental to good mental health, and that you use surprisingly often -- while stuck in traffic or the dentist's chair.  I would be uncomfortable with too much talk about the spiritual aspects of yoga, which is one reason I don't take classes, and a reason that I really like Bryan Kest.  These classes are straightforward, effective, and easy to follow.  They aren't easy to do, however, and I don't think I'd recommend them to someone who didn't start out in pretty good shape.  I've found that when my back is feeling touchy, these classes will push it over the edge.  If you have back problems, you might want to look elsewhere.  If you want an athletic but still calming yoga experience, try Bryan Kest.",1222128000,2,1441,4.420454545454546

This yoga is for no wimps though... so hang tight because you're going on a ride of extreme yoga! Bryan has such a way of pushing you to go further in your practice. However, you don't feel overwhelmed... he is very incouraging and before  you realize it, you just held Half Moon for an HOUR! No, seriously, this is a workout, but, you also know by the end you have just been ""opened"" up... mind, body and spirit. Plus, who cares if he's another pretty face in yoga, he's still an awesome teacher. I highly recommend this dvd..

680909,5,6303548970,"I have to begin by addressing the wide array of reviews here.  It seems that the biggest discrepancy is whether or not Kest is truly doing yoga or if he is truly a yogi or an appropriate teacher.  Really, I agree with the person who said that it is a personal thing.  I had not done yoga before getting this set.  I had done pilates and have a good foundation of body awareness, so that helped in overcoming the fact that I did not have a teacher there to help me with my form.  But as long as I felt good, I didn't worry about it.  And now, my form has improved greatly.

I have used Yoga Journal's website to read about each pose to educate myself further about body position and pitfalls to avoid.  But overall, just doing the tape again and again, my body has learned the poses and grown into them.

I gained 55 pounds during my pregnancy with my now two-year-old daughter.  I went from a size 4-6 to a size 14!  The last two years, I have really struggled to lose the weight and it has affected me emotionally as well.  This summer, I began using this tape and I immediately began to lose weight.  I am now back to a size 6 and down to my pre-pregnancy weight (I was 15 lbs. over when I started this program).

More importantly, it has completely changed my way of life.  It has affected the way I eat, breathe, sleep, and look at the world.  I don't know why and maybe that is not the case for everyone, but I truly feel that my life has been changed by my practice.

To each their own...I greatly dislike many of the DVDs that folks who have dissed Bryan Kest's have recommended.  There is no need to dissuade people from trying this because it is not ""true yoga.""  Who gets to decide that anyway?  Diversity...tolerance...acceptance...isn't that ""true yoga?""",1219881600,17,1766,4.310030395136778
680910,5,6303548970,"I bought this video after getting a recommendation from my yoga teacher and reading other Amazon reviews, before leaving on an extended vacation (where a live class would not be available). Like many others here, I think this yoga set absolutely rocks- it is an excellent and balanced yoga series (bends, balance, strength) which is challenging, but not dangerously so (and there are three levels to choose from).  I can see how it would be a matter of personal preference whether you would like the constant chatter and direction Bryan Kest gives during the set, but in my opinion his encouragement and focus on breathing calmly through challenging poses is very motivating and keeps things focused and moving along (others may like silence and peace during their yoga) I find this series very similar to going to a live class where there is generally direction ( and this style is my personal preference).  In any event I cant say enough about this dvd, I find it as beneficial as going to live class, and you will definitely get a good yoga body/ mind experience here, along with a strengthening amd motivational workout.  One of my favorite things about this set is Kest's frequent instruction to work with where you are at, challenge yourself to your own edge, but if you need to bend your knees etc, so what, its your practice and you are built differently then everyone else, so push yourself only to the point where you can breathe calmly etc... good stuff and good instruction..

Finally, a personal note as to the effectivenees of the wokout series, at first I was challenged and sweating during parts of level 1 such as holding down dog for minutes at a time and the constant chattarongas (sp?)- but after 5 weeks level 1 and 2 have become challenging but very doable without much sweat and flexibility and strength have improved dramatically  ( ie can now hold standing prayer twist and camel pose at length etc0 and attribute this to the effectiveness of the series ( and there were no injuries over this time)...",1219536000,4,2026,4.744318181818182
680911,4,6303548970,"I only have two complaints- (1)when it says ""beginners"" for the first session, that means ""beginners who have done yoga before, either videos or classes, but got out of their yoga practice routine, and want to get back into it again."" In other words, if you don't have experience with yoga (any kind-it doesn't have to be Ashtanga or Power Yoga) then you may want to go with something else first, so you can get the basics. I have over 20 yoga videos, but it didn't ""click"" with me until I did Rainbeau Mars' DVD's. (These are the best, in my opinion, to start with if you are a true beginner-she gives constant attention to correct form and you begin to understand what your REALLY supposed to be doing with your body in downward facing dog, from your toes all the way to your fingers-and other poses as well.) (2)Also,it would have been nice to have had someone in the class showing what the modified forms would be-b/c some of these poses are tough, and I didn't want to lose the focus and just plop down on the floor! Child's pose is good, but there has to be a modified version, where I would still be getting the benefits of the pose, without going as deep.

That said, if you come to this practice as someone with yoga experience, trust me-you will love it! I've never done ""power yoga"" before, b/c I thought it would be a lot of ""moving quickly through a sequence, over and over"" and I was pleasantly surprised. Believe me, Bryan Kest shows you that you don't have to move quickly to work up a sweat! I've never sweated that much to a workout video before-and I usually don't sweat that much, anyway (TMI!). It took me a while to get used to his tone of voice (not a soft, soothing voice like I'm used to) but towards the end, I liked it b/c of his intensity and I felt like I was in a gym taking one of his classes, instead of in my home. I was also proud of myself-I did a tough pose I've never done before and I kept thinking about how I want to stick with this so I can work up to doing the poses that I couldn't do! (with the correct form, of course!) And, like I mentioned before, while I wish he had someone showing a modified form, he did do a great job of reminding me throughout that it doesn't matter if you aren't able to do everything like they are-""if you're doing the best you can, then you're doing it perfectly"".",1218672000,,2337,4.251685393258427

Kest is a seriously flawed yoga instructor not only for the reasons that I stated in my review of the product I had the misfortune to buy (and subsequently throw away to save anyone else to suffer such a bogus yoga instructor), but for the fact that his conduct is soooo inappropriate and seriously unbecoming of a good yoga instructor. In response to another reviewer who didn't understand the rave reviews, my only guess is that they don't know any better- either in understanding the reverence in which the yogic tradition is held or the conduct of its highest acolytes- the yogi/yogini. It does not surprise me that I had, until I'd browsed Amazon.com for yoga material for backs, never heard of Bryan Kest before, read about him in the many yoga magazines I read or find anything else about him.

There quite simply is not enough warm up at the beginning of each section, then after the limited warm-up, he goes right into VERY long downward dog poses. Which are fine, but such long poses need proper warm-up or you WILL injure yourself. I've been doing yoga for 8 years and the MOST IMPORTANT factor in not injuring yourself is proper warm-up. Its a decent workout otherwise. When the rare occasion pops up that I actually do use this DVD, I warm up first with another yoga DVD. Not to mention his inane coaching is also dangerous. He mentions that its not important to do the poses properly, just as long as you do ""something"" and other nonsensical babbling like ""its not important what you do, but how you do what you do"" and the immediate workout killer ""come down gently into plank pose as if an old lady is living underneath you"". WTF?????

His 90s heavy metal hair doesn't help any either. One bonus is the beautiful women in sexy workout clothes. But that shouldn't be enough to buy this.

It's very hard to get into the flow and focus on breathing when your pulse starts beating like a drum in your head to music that you can't turn off (even during savasana). This might work for some, but definitely not for me. If there were an atmosphere rating (scene, music, loudness of voice) for yoga DVDs, I would have known better before buying this one- buyer beware!",1217462400,27,544,4.3431372549019605

These videos provide excellent workouts.  I work a lot, and sometimes getting a workout in is difficult.  I can wake up at 5:30, pop this DVD in, and I am done with a fantastic workout by 6:30.  And I mean done: in my work clothes, feeling energized and calm, and ready to walk out the door and handle any amount of stress.

He does approach the spiritual side of yoga, but he sneaks it in.  I find that approach more appealing, as I use yoga primarily to help my marathon training.

He has interested me in exploring yoga further: I've also bought his longer CD booklet workouts.  Those are difficult but are so good that they leave you feeling like a different person.  I especially recommend the Long, Slow and Deep routine.

I absolutely love this collection. It truly is POWER Yoga-- and you get a great workout from all three sessions.

Do this often, every day if possible, and you will see your body transform by toning and strengthening the entire body.

Bryan does a great job walking you through on how to position the body during every pose and is very considerate about all types of bodies and flexibility.

However, this is NOT Yoga for beginners. If your Yoga level is intermediate, then Bryan will definitely take you to the next level.

At first, I was somewhat unsure whether I would like it or not, because it was different from the usual videos I own--one instructor calling out poses in quick sequence.  After using the workout once, I was in love with Kest!  You feel as if you are part of the studio that is fortunate enough to have him for an instructor.  The workouts are extremely satisfying -- whether you want to have an intensive stretching workout, or an intricate, near impossible series of poses, you have a choice because the DVD is broken down into 3 workouts.  Kest explains every single pose in detail so that you don't even have to watch the video (sometimes it's pretty tricky to look up while getting into pretzel-type poses), you just need to pay attention.  My only complaint is that sometimes the sound quality isn't clear, but it's a very small price to pay--the DVD is well worth the money, and more!",1215388800,,928,4.593939393939394

He talks a lot about doing Yoga with the right intention, but I doubt he does Yoga for the right reasons.  In these classes he sure seems to love himself and his awesome bod. I wish he had different music and more varied set of body types to demonstrate the classes.  He does not give much or any instruction on how to do the yoga posses,nor does he give any modifications to the posses.  Even though some of his students are advanced, many have horrible sway backs.  There is no emphasis on lengthening the lower spine.  Instead many of the students seem as if they are trying to curve their spines as much as possible while sticking out their derrieres.  The programs do give you a variety of classes, and as I said the price is incredible, but is it too much to ask for Bryan to cover his manly chest and to put his cascading hair back?",1213228800,3,1001,4.226315789473684
680981,5,6303548970,"I want to get one thing out of the way first: I can see why some people were turned off by this DVD. Yes, it appears to strive for glamor. Yes, Bryan Kest's attitude stands out. Yes, he does not stop talking (I actually think he was guiding but ok, I'll go with talking). In fact, my wife, the moment I began playing this DVD, said that Bryan Kest comes across as annoying and seems to be just so in love with himself.

But I think this is all just a perception (which sometimes is everything). Here's what I noticed first about these yoga workouts (there are three of them: Energize, Tone, and Sweat). In the beginning, Bryan ALWAYS tells you several key rules in his workouts: breathing is important, ""there is no such thing as a perfect pose"", we are not trying to get anywhere, we are just trying to be in the present (or something like that). And when I hear this and I see how his students do things perfectly, I tell myself that with small steps I may be able to do the same poses, and perfectly, in the future. But I am not driving myself crazy about it.

All three workouts are not for beginners and cover a lot of different poses. I am still trying to figure out the rationale behind naming the workouts because regardless which one I do, after them I feel energized, toned, and drop about a gallon of sweat.

Her voice sounds as she is suffering or in a porno flick.  Do not like, either.  I want and like a soothing, compassionate, and knowledgeable atmosphere, not a Divo with so much ego that he seems to be ""allowing"" you his presence, as a gift from heaven.

Then, when I watched and started practising yoga from this DVD, I felt like he was telling us exactly how to do, rather than what to do.  Never push yourself too much, but you need to push yourself only a little, only till you can hold your breath fluid and face calm and mind relaxed.

Slowly, I am at a point where I can complete most of the poses, feel and get the benefits from them.

1. it's from the 90s, and quite obvious that it is. between his outfits, the horrible student outfits (kangaroo underwear?!), and bad haircuts i couldn't stop laughing.
2. the guy takes himself WAY Too seriously. not in a yoga way, but in a ""I'm a yoga rock star wanna be"" kind of way.
3. he moves too fast to feel the stretch and power of each position
4. he never stops talking. if i have to hear him say ""Tenacity!"" one more time, i'll scream. it was SO distracting i literally was groaning during my poses instead of breathing.
5. i've never seen someone grope students the way he does. i know sometimes instructors will modify your stance in a pose to help, but not this guy. he's all about feeling up his students. at least he's an equal opportunity groper. both the guys and girl students got some lovin from bryan.

i played the dvd one time, and i have to honestly say, it will never go back in the dvd player unless i want a good laugh with friends at how horrible this dvd is.

i ended up buying shiva's shakti DVD, and it's exactly what i was hoping for and more. customizable yoga sessions, great instruction, calm voice talking, and she doesn't say tenacity once!",1191628800,18,1316,4.39344262295082
681229,5,6303548970,"... that can be enjoyed by conscientious beginners and intermediate yogis looking for comprehensive, flowing yoga lessons.

From beginning to end each class flows smoothly from one traditional pose to the next. Stretches, balances, twists and strength asanas are all in each lesson.  Every part of the body is addressed.  Beginners can follow the instruction and take rest where necessary; intermediates can focus, look within themselves, and increase the intensity to the desired level of challenge. (The classes don't include advanced poses; for info, the toughest examples are probably upward facing bow, crow and bound revolved extended side angle.)

Of course there are similarities between each class (come on, yoga's asanas have been around for a few thousand years now and these classes are not trying to reinvent them to suit those who ""want something different""); the subtle changes in instruction, variations and timing result in three quite different and challenging practices.  Having done each of them a number of times now, I definitely feel this disc is a great investment.

The Bryan Kest debate rages on! His accent and personal teaching style are distinctive and whether the latter suits you is going to be a matter of personal taste. It's true he keeps the `instruction' going the whole time. He passionately includes motivational messages about us each being different, having our own levels of strength and flexibility and how we should not be comparing ourselves to others, telling us ""we're all perfect if we are where we are because where we are is perfect"" etc. His instruction to the poses is never adversely affected though.  He cues well, offers variations for different ability levels and continues to guide you through adjustments, correct alignment, placement and breathing while you hold the poses.  If you're not judgmental about his choice of stylized presentation, BK's intro to each class is worth using as a time to centre yourself and remind yourself of your breathing.

I don't understand people who criticize BK's accent at all! Surely we all have our own way of speaking and should accept the differences in others without judgment! Similarly, why criticize the fact that he's not teaching us what some people call enlightenment and `the true path of yoga' etc.  Yoga is personal and individual.  Please don't try to tell me I should only be allowed to practice if I follow your philosophies!

Stable filming very clearly illustrates the poses described; visually beautiful, trendy (for the time) and stylized; beautiful people doing the poses gracefully, with strength and poise. I found the audio quality to be extremely clear.",1191024000,6,2671,5.186046511627907
681230,1,6303548970,"Instructors like Kest are the reason yoga is so misinterpreted in the U.S.  This DVD is not real yoga.  Yoga is about transformation and using the body to slow the mind (which eventually leads to enlightenment), not getting a workout while watching a porn-star looking man in jeans graphically touching male and female students (the male on sweaty male ""adjustments"" are very creepy even for an open minded liberal yogi).  It's interesting all the good reviews on this product say ""it's a good workout,"" when that is so far from what yoga is about.  If you want exercise, go to the gym. If you're going to try yoga, do it for the right reasons and try a purer form of the practice.

I have to agree with others that Yee's probably not as challenging as Kest. Also, it's nice to have 3 workouts in 1 DVD so I don't have to hunt down 3 discs! For the beginner it's critical to LISTEN to Kest's advice to challenge yourself but NOT exceed your limits or try to compete with anyone. I'm still at the ""shaky"" stage doing the 1st level, but I feel that I can try most of the poses and modify a bit when I need to, stop when I need to, without feeling inferior or getting that hopeless feeling that I'll never be fit or strong enough to do it. Maybe some are put off my his ongoing advice but I find it gentle and constantly encouraging, not annoying. [And if some of you think his ""Jersey accent"" is too heavy, y'all may want to examine your own ""accent""! I'm from NY, & his is pretty toned down!] You will get a lot of bang for your buck from this video, plus it's nicely produced. Bryan is very very nice to look at (as are his very fit class participants, male & female). But even though some camerawork is clearly shot to highlight his attractiveness, he himself focuses on you, the class, and teaching you to do your best for yourself & no one else. To be clear, the physical beauty in this video is not over the top, its just enough to be a bit of eye candy while you're shakily trying to balance on one foot & imagining one day if you keep it up, you could just maybe look like them.

The Good: Three solid workouts on one DVD, each coming in at about an hour. ""Classroom"" setting, showing different students with differing skill levels performing the poses: a great way to demonstrate that everyone will engage each pose a bit different. Quick clips of the poses by Brian mixed into the workouts, just in case you need a closer look at a pose. Poses are held for longer durations, truly adding to the challenge.

The Bad: Brian talks way too much. I love this DVD for the workouts-but I'm left feeling less than calm when I'm finished. Yee's ""power yoga: full body"" isn't nearly as tough, yet Yee's delivery leaves you feeling the way you should after a session... calm, relaxed, and clear. For some reason, the director chose to shoot the last session in a ""rose"" tinted view. Annoying, though during a normal practice you won't be looking at the screen anyway. Brian has ""pet"" names for some of the poses, and doesn't explicitly state what pose your going into next... he relies on you either watching the screen, or having memory of the routine. His routines don't flow as well as I would have liked.

The Verdict: Even with the constant commentary and stunted flow, it's still three solid yoga workouts that will challenge you for quite some time. At less than $15.00... this is a bargain.",1183939200,4,1552,4.762081784386617

I've always thought yoga would be a really easy (translation:wimpy) exercise routine, but I wanted something to do on rainy days when I couldn't go rollerblading or play tennis/basketball.  So I popped this bad boy in.....D@mn was I wrong!  It took me a few tries just to be able to get through the entire volume 1. (Each volume is about an hour long) By the time I finished I was absolutely dripping with sweat, and this was supposed to be the easiest one!  I haven't ventured on to volumes 2 and 3 yet but I'm sure they're even harder.

I like how Bryan explains that you don't have to be able to throw your leg over your head to get the bennefit of the class--you just have to do your best and make sure you're ""feeling something"" as he puts it.  While I consider myself fairly flexible and athletic, the people on this video put me to shame--but Bryan says that's OK :-)

I love the progression of the 3 parts.  I have to ignore the fact that all of the models he has are extremely thin.  They all are very advanced.  I think it would be great to see at least one of the models having to modify the moves.

Since then, I've tried many other dvd's and I always go back to this one. Other videos have too perky instructors, silly music, or other draw backs. Bryan Kest's series is peaceful, challenging, and regardless of what others have said about his hair or voice - this set is truly well pieced together to create a complete workout.

681394,5,6303548970,"Besides the instructors cheezy hair and 80s wardrode, this video is a great exercise tool. It is among my favorites. there are 3 full length exercise sets, each progressively more difficult than the last. The exercises are challenging in many ways. They test your strength, balance, focus, and patience. Each set can be done at any level, as the exercises are presented in their beginner, intermediate, and more advanced forms. The trick for the viewers/participants is too know and accept when you have reached your limits, don't push to do the advanced pose=> over stretching, forfeiting propper form, or losing focus and balance. Do not hesitate to jump right into this video series. He will teach you the proper form, and you can graduate up through the exercises.

Brian Kest is very reassuring, sometimes bordering cheezy, but if you pull your mind out of a judging mentality, and open up, sometimes you realize that he is only seeming cheezy because you are infact judging him and yourself. Brian Kest encourages you to take these exercises to your limit, and let your body work as it was designed to work, and not based upon judgement or expectations. Its a very good life mentality.

The exercise class is a bit intimidating as they are all maximally flexable and very thin. Yet again, the wardrobe is very strange, as some of the women are wearing leotards (one is even a thong over tights) and the men are wearing similarly tight shorts that resemble underwear. Not typical for any gym or yoga studio i have ever been too, thank goodness. Don't let this deter you from this video, as the exercise is great!! Plus you should be focusing on form and not what others are wearing, although it is a bit humerous.

This may not be the ideal beginner yoga video, as he does move right along, and there are better videos out there that really pull apart the poses and explain the fundamentals of the practice of yoga such as Patricia Waldens Yoga for Beginners. The Yoga Zone series of videos. If you buy just one or 2 begginner videos, and really learn the form correctly, the the Power yoga and more intermediate to advanced poses come more naturally, and you understand what to do with your body and how to do it.

For ME, David Swenson has it all over this video.  The class is held in a brick building...not the lovely zen garden Swenson practices in.  The music borders on something from a porn film.  Mr. Cool Kest walks around shirtless, with hair streaming, among perfect bodied students.  I don't like his voice.  He isn't calm and soothing.  What with the power music, I feel almost a sense of foreboding....like we are prisoners assigned to a task. All that being said, the positions are good.  He does an overall body stretch and achieves actually some fairly advanced postures even in the beginner class.

If the atmosphere doesn't bother you, fine.  I can see myself doing this DVD at home only if I am in the mood to do postures not included in Swenson's.  For ME, yoga includes more than just bending while breathing. Also, anyone without some yoga background will have a very hard time following even the beginner practice.  You can't hear Kest very well and he doesn't demonstrate.",1177804800,15,1117,4.785340314136126

681485,5,6303548970,"This is one of the best yoga DVDs on the market.  I have been practising Ashtanga yoga on and off for a while.  Many DVDs do not accomodate different levels of strength and flexibility.  This one does.  There are three segments, each about 50 minutes for beginners, intermediate, and advanced.  However, each one is challenging and throughout them all, modifications and encouragement are provided.  Also, Brian Kest provides nice verbal reminders about proper positioning that many DVDs don't do.

He does speak a fair amount, and I have read that annoys some, but I find these workouts so challenging that my focus is more on my breath and form than on him.  His outfit is interesting, but once you start the DVD you don't notice because you are really working.  The workout is challenging and satisfying.  I have been doing this DVD for almost a month and I know I will continue to use for a long time to come.",1173744000,6,913,4.65

I've only tried the first program as the other two are a bit too advanced for me yet.

This is not a DVD for relaxation, but it is good for upper/lower workout for strength and flexibility.  Sometimes the direction is a bit too fast, lots of up-dog, down dog etc.

I struggled quite a bit initially BUT - started to feel and see results quickly too.  I guarantee if you can do this 3/4 times a week you will feel a gain  in strength - especially at your shoulders, but you will have earned it ;)  Your back will also be stronger and more flexible.

Brian as an instuctor is ok - its extremely funny to hear some of the motivation stuff he says dead-pan.  It was nice to see a mixed level of students in his class - not everyone had perfect form and flexibility (though all were at least at medium level proficiency)

This is by far the best US based yoga DVD I have tried to date and with 3 sessions its fairly good value too.

My advice would be to alternate between this DVD and a more relaxing one  ( Howard Nappers is good but probably hard to find in US )

681487,5,6303548970,"This is by far my favorite power yoga workout.  Before starting this workout, I previously did cardio and weights on a weekly basis so I was looking for something a little challenging for my muscles that would allow me to get more flexible at the same time.  This DVD was perfect.  If you are completely new to exercise in general, I wouldn't recommend this DVD as you might want to find something a little easier to start off with.

The timing and fluidity of the poses was just perfect.  Some people have mentioned they were annoyed by Kest's constant talking but I rather liked it.  He was constantly reminding me of things to focus on in the poses (which no matter how advanced you are, you still forget sometimes) and keeps encouraging you to do what you can do and not worry about what those around you can do.  This definitely helps as you are watching the 'gumby girls' in this DVD.  Yes the thong leotards are a bit much, but I don't see why anyone would really need to be focusing on that if your main concern is getting a good workout.  Music and ambience are good as well.

After only a few weeks, I noticed the muscles in my arms were a bit thicker and my flexibility has increased to a good degree (and with my genentics from my very non-flexible family, that's saying something).  I have many different power yoga DVDs from various instructors, and this is by far my favorite.  Highly recommend.",1173571200,3,1410,4.46484375

I was very eager to alternate between these two and set myself a good yoga work out routine. While watching Bryan's video it did not seem so bad and I was eager to try it out myself. But as it turned out, this video was not made with the intent and care for the person who will be watching his class and him from a television set in his/her  living room. His intrustctions are non-ending, most of the time meaningless and very annoying. He gives no time for showing a pose now giving the viewer time to understand and follow. It is also frustrating to actually find the 'inner peace and stablity' that he goes on and on about when he is yakkity yakking non-stop about redundant and irrelevant matters. As it goes, I couldn't even get through half an hour without looking up from my pose, uncertain and panicking if I have missed the cue for the next pose or to figure out what the next pose was because his intrustctions were so obtuse. Rather than finding physical and mental peace and power, I was irratible and unsure as to what I was doing. Oh ! and did I mention ? You will not be watching Bryan do most of the poses, he just strolls around talking non-stop while correcting a bunch of people in his class.

I would not recomend this DV, maybe bryan is a good teacher if you were to join his class physically at California. But this video is NOT made with the care and thought that someone will be watching and trying to learn from a television set.",1173484800,105,1549,4.301369863013699

Kest does not instruct you how to breathe but, he does constantly remind you of the breath. He is unable to physically make adjustments to your posture but, he explains the poses very thoroughly. I recommend watching 15 min. of Power 1 at first then, trying that part along with his instruction. Build up your stamina in 15 min. increments until you can complete the class.

In all the times I've done the program, I can never complete more than 3 shallow breaths. He simply rushes on before considering the amount of time such breathing takes. And that's the overall feeling I have of the DVD, too busy, too much talking by Kest. He repeats several mantras, such as ""There's no perfect pose"" and ""It's not what you do, it's how you do what you do,"" to the point they become irritating.

There's no question he knows what he's doing, and he demonstrates the poses nicely, though he doesn't do a very good job of showing alternates for those of us not as limber as his class members.

I've noticed an improvement in my flexibility and strengh in less than a month.  I'm a runner and doing the first practice has significantly helped my flexibility and stretching.

The second workout is my favorite as it seems to be more balanced and has a good flow from one pose to the next. The first workout is great but I don't like spending so much time in the up-dog position.

I can't stand when people attack the way person looks totally ignoring the fact that the video recording is simply OLD (many people still work out with Jane Fonda tapes because the quality of the excercise that counts not the colour of tights)!!!

681787,5,6303548970,"I've been using this DVD regularly for the past few months and think it is one well worth the money.  Some of the things I like about it:

1. Three workouts in one DVD, easy to bring around especially for a person who travels frequently like me;

2. The three programs offer various levels of difficulties, so you can grow into it or swap among them depending on your mood that day.

3. Bryan Kest gives very clear instructions, something I've learnt to be grateful for after trying out a couple other DVDs where the workouts were great but the instructions left me utterly confused.  It's tough to cultivate a peaceful mind when you have to keep looking up and rewinding the tape because the instructions aren't clear.  No such problems with Bryan Kest in this DVD!

4. Along with his clear instructions, Bryan often gives pointers and reminders about form.  He also offers modifications for different levels, so really the workouts are suitable for most people.

Compared to, say, Yoga Radiance or Litsa Kapantais' ""The Art of Vinyasa Flow"", I perspired a little less with Bryan's.  This might be because in Yoga Radiance etc, I was in constant motion, while with Bryan's workouts, there would be times when you stay in a position for a few breaths.  That's not necessarily bad - there's more time to make sure your form is right and you can exercise muscles intensively even if you are not moving (sometimes it's even easier to move than to stay!).

Some reviewers have commented on Bryan's voice and his continuous talking.  It's a matter of preference, but personally I don't have any problems with his voice, and his constant pointers were great reminders for me who sometimes forget to watch my form or breathe deeply when trying to stay in a challenging pose.  As for his (rather) long monologues before each workout, I just hit the forward button :-)

One thing though - I miss having some background music.  But that is a minor point.  I just pop in a favorite CD and problem solved!

The first two are so challenging, in fact, that I haven't even attempted the 3rd workout!  Bryan Kest promises that after the practice you will ""feel alive"" and be ""tingling from your head to your feet.""  SO TRUE!  I do have to warn, however, that even ""Energize"" is quite difficult and probably not feasible for yoga beginners.  I am in really good shape and I have to drop out of some of the poses! He is a very good teacher and coaxes you through the harder poses with great insight.

If you get this DVD, I would recommend:

*Watch it once to get over any mastubatory fantasies.  The class members are YUMMY, but while you are participating, you won't even look.

*You can only use the FF/REV buttons on your remote because the 3 workouts are only formatted as scenes.

*Keep your remote next to you during corpse pose.  You are sweaty and exhausted when he puts you down there, and it feels really good to sink into it...but it's WAY too short.

The second in the series is by far the most difficult physically, but all three are fun, which is not something I say for the others in my collection. I personally like Bryan's teaching style, and I think having a class setting helps by letting you see how each person does each pose differently, reinforcing Bryan's teaching that the poses conform to us, we do not conform to the poses.

One warning, however, I wouldn't recommend these for an absolute beginner. But if you have a couple of months experience, you should be fine.",1162771200,,695,4.69672131147541
681872,3,6303548970,"There are 3 routines, each 50 minutes long which is nice, or you can do all 3 together. However, I don't care for his mannerism, or the way he explains some of the moves. Some of his instructions could cause a beginner to hurt themselves. Also, the women in his class look as if they are competing with one another or trying to show off, which is contrary to what yoga is about. I was a little disappointed, but session 2 and 3 give a pretty good workout.",1162598400,3,455,4.181818181818182
681873,3,6303548970,"I've been doing yoga for a long time in studios, and needed a DVD to work from when I'm traveling for work.

I like that there are three full workouts in one DVD.  The poses he's chosen are OK, they're basic poses and he goes over options for people at different levels and flexibilities.

The narrative is not clear, the sound quality is sometimes a bit muffled when he's walking around the class, and he doesn't do a good job of naming the poses and saying he's moving on to something else.  He treats yoga like aerobics, repeating throwaway ""motivational"" lines instead of using the time to increase knowledge of the pose.

At one point, he said to go into ""Cobra"", but everyone was clearly doing ""up dog"".  These are two completely different poses.  The guy needs to do some yoga refresher classes. Maybe even learn the Hindi words for poses.

There is no reason he couldn't have been more informative in this DVD.  Every yoga instruction I've been to in a studio has included at least some description of the proper pose, health benefits, etc.  and they are always conscious to be sure their narrative is clear so that you don't have to look up from a pose to know what's going on.  It's almost as if he's using the video format as a crutch-- so you have to watch it to know what's happening.

Other than that, it was an OK video for people who have already done yoga.  But I would recommend that people take classes in a studio before doing yoga at home to be sure you understand the poses-- there is a lot of subtlety that you can't get from looking at people doing a pose on the screen.",1162512000,9,1594,4.380952380952381

I didn't have to crane my neck while I was in a pose to see what everyone else was doing, he explains everything really well.

What I love most is the fact that I have muscles back that I haven't had since before my first child was born, and I am truly strong now.  Not that false image of strength you get from weights at the gym, true strength. And my balance is amazing, I can do a full headstand already!

The workout is challenging but easy to adapt to any skill/experience level.  He's a little geeky/dorky, but that gives the video ""real life"" quality that's easy to relate to (if you're a dork, too! hee).  Actually, I really  like his philosophy about yoga and about challenging ourselves as individuals, taking the ""competitive"" and ""perfection"" vibes out of yoga, which turns me off of many videos and classes.  In short, a good workout that doesn't get boring.",1161734400,,628,5.048543689320389

Bryan's sequences comprise a well-designed, logical and complete series for serious practitioners. Even after 4 years (starting with the videos), I am still surprised at what I can get out these workouts. The videos are also well-made.  In addition to showing how his class is doing the poses, you also see shots of Bryan doing the poses himself.

A number of people complain about Bryan's obvious penchance for talking. I love it though. First, most of what he says are encouragements. His workouts are not easy. So, his explanations and encouragement, especially during the difficult poses, actually help me to stay in there until the next pose. Second, if you listen to the essence of what he says, you will learn a lot about yoga. Third, I feel like I'm in one of his actual classes, rather than just watching him on video/DVD. Fourth, his talking wakes me up in the morning. What I like about him is that he neither talks down to nor talks over the heads of his audience. His love for yoga and respect for his audience show.

NOTE:  This series is not for a beginner, so you are new at yoga, I strongly recommend that you start with a beginner's DVD and practice for a while before starting with Bryan Kest's DVDs.",1161302400,2,1380,4.566801619433198

I've noticed my arm strength has increased for the first time in years.  I feel powerful and refreshed after this practice.  Although Bryan can seem a little odd at times, he makes me want to keep pushing myself and yet not feel ashamed when I can't go any further.  I'm so used to traditional workouts after playing soccer all my life, but this really has made me see how yoga can be an effective strenghtening tool.  I'm now in med school and I also see how yoga can be an effective tool at achieving balance in your life.

I've never felt so challenged by a yoga workout.  There are three workouts, progressively more difficult, so  once I can push myself further and further without getting bored.  I feel strengthened from the inside out and stretched.  I could do without some of the white spandex.

Lots of variety is a good thing when your practice is home based and you are pressed for time.  Thanks to Amazon and the many reviewers I have workouts to fit every time frame and every energy level on a given day.  Bryans DVD has slowly and surely become my favorite, bar none.  Its a tremendous bang for the buck for what Amazon sells the 3-set DVD for and the workout always leaves me feeling great.  If I had to choose one Yoga DVD this would be the one.  Others I like are Rainbeau Mars POWER and SWEAT, two great 30 minute workouts and Karen Voights YOGA POWER which has a nice 30 minute strength session and a 20 minute stretch session.

Brian Kest runs through each work out very smoothly and calmly, his voice is very soothing and it's easy to relax to.  Some of the moves are a little bit hard to hold in the beginning and during the beginning I had to come out of most of the poses, but as I got stronger I could do them for the longer duration on the dvd.

kest reminds constantly to stay out of the ego, to respect your genetic inheritance in terms of flexibility, to not compare oneself to others and to be in our own bodies and listening carefully to where the sweet spots of growth exist.

the best teacher i have ever studied with.",1152489600,8,515,4.7

The look, as many have noted, is quite dated and you might want to get a workout buddy to exchange snarky  quips on Kest's navel gazing-especially at the beginning of each workout. However, once the class begins the yoga itself is pretty engaging and there is a definite, noted progression in intensity and difficulty between  the three levels.

Chances are pretty good that you will, indeed, sweat. I've had some difficulty finding yoga DVDs that really progress beyond a seasoned beginner's level, but I'm still working my way into Level 3 of this set and get a decent workout just repeating level 2.

682032,5,6303548970,I realy like the style of this yoga dvd. It made me feel like I was part of the class. It wasn't overly challenging  or too easy for me. I would say it was just right. Like he says in the dvd there are no perfect poses. I could do this dvd for years and still have room to improve. I was skeptical about the production being over 10 years ago. But it has the same names and movements we use today so I did not find that this made any difference.,1147478400,3,445,3.8369565217391304
682033,4,6303548970,"I've dabbled in yoga off and on for a number of years, but with big gaps, so I know most of the basic poses but can only do the easier modified or standard versions. That said, I just did the beginner workout on from this set. I haven't done the intermediate or advanced. The only power yoga I've done before are Baron Baptiste's videos, so it was interesting to try a different teacher. I liked Kest's teaching style on the whole. He puts a lot of focus on breathing, and reminds you a lot not to worry about how you look, just to focus on how you feel. He doesn't invoke any spiritual stuff, it's all about just being calm and feeling what's going on with your body. I do wish he used more of the pose names. He'd often explain what to do, and if I wasn't in a position where I could see the computer screen I had to stop and look. Or I'd puzzledly do what he was explaining only to realize... oh, Warrior 1. When he does use pose names he mixes English names with the Sanskrit  ones. Aside from that, though, the instruction on how to do poses was good (though maybe not good enough for someone who's never done any yoga before). The only pose I hadn't encountered before turned out to be the awesomest glute stretcher I've ever done.

The Baptiste DVDs I really like are the Live ones and Journey into Power level 2. Kest gave easier modifications on a few poses (like he assumes you'll want to do modified side plank instead of full, though he does mention how to do full side plank), but he makes you hold them longer so it sort of panned out to be the same level, maybe a little easier. I didn't build up quite as much of a sweat in the Kest program. I haven't tried intermediate yet though.

In terms of aesthetics... It's so awesomely 90s-tastic. While Kest doesn't have a soul patch or ghotee, his hair is nearly Chris Cornellian (during the early Soundgarden days, of course) but pulled back into a sensitive guy ponytail. He walks around the demo classroom shirtless with white spandex pants with baggy cutoffs over them, bringing back the early Pearl Jam flashbacks. The guys in the demo class are all basically topless in white boxers. The women have white spandexy things going on. The studio is really pretty, with old brick and wood. I enjoyed the grunge flashbacks, but I guess they could be distracting to others.

The music was a wacky combo of middle eastern and African drumming with, like, Manheim Steamroller. It wasn't bad, but it's not your standard yoga fare.

All in all it was pretty good. I'm sure I'll do this one again and will probably try out the next level soon.",1147478400,16,2597,4.402083333333334

I then bought this campy, 'retro' DVD and have not been able to get past its distracting/humorous antiquity. It's fun to see Seane Corn back when she was Bryan's student but I would choose her DVDs or any of Bryan's CDs any day over this DVD.

Now I'm glad I gave it a go, because this is fantastic and challenging (in a good way).  He seems to be a very top-notch instructor and I'm tempted to buy his other workouts now.

There are three ashtanga yoga workouts here that get a little more tricky each time - each being around 50 minutes.  The first workout focus's on breathing and form, the second on power yoga concentrating on balance, strength and your flexibility and the third, being the hardest, is for people with a lot of upper and lower body strength.  You'll also need to be extremely flexible for that one.  I can't do that yet, but it's fun to have something to work toward.

You'll also notice that this is filmed with that sepia type film which is kinda unique.  Anyway, it's tough but fun, and as I said, it gives you a goal to work toward and you'll find that rewarding in itself and you'll be nice and relaxed from having done this great workout.",1145145600,13,1045,4.350515463917525

682119,4,6303548970,"Over the years, I have attempted several times to learn yoga, and until this Brian Kest video, I couldn't figure out what the big deal was.

When I do yoga, I want to feel as if I'm actually working out.  I want to feel muscle soreness for a day or two, so I know that I did something.  With this video, I do.

I have tried a few basic videos and one class through community education, and those increased my flexibility and were very relaxing, but it didn't keep my interest because in my busy schedule I couldn't justify the time spent when all I did was stretch and breathe deeply.  Whereas even the beginner phase of the Brian Kest video makes me feel like I've done a workout, where I'm sore for a few days after, AND it still increased my flexiblity and relaxation.

Yoga is one of those things where the better you get at it, the more you get a workout from it, at least in the beginning.  If you can't hold a position for very long, you're not going to get as much from it if you could hold it for a longer time. But that short amount of time does do something because the next time you try you can hold it a little bit longer, and go a little bit deeper.  Brian Kest is good at reminding you during the workout that it's okay if you can't hold the position, just respect where you are.  And I think that's important to keep you from getting discouraged.",1141862400,7,1362,4.1679389312977095

I like the idea of being able to work at different levels within the same sequences of poses, and his philosophy of no perfect pose-- we are not trying to get there, we are trying to BE HERE-- these things are very important and often left out of yoga workouts, presumably because people are more worried about weight loss etc.  The three workouts definitly feel like real astanga yoga to me, not those silly impersonations.

It's very challenging, but Bryan Kest's calm reassurances are just what I needed.",1140739200,3,370,4.257142857142857
682176,5,6303548970,"I love this dvd. I had never tried yoga before this dvd, but I'm very glad I started with this one.  Bryan Kest's Power Yoga is an intense workout that will definitely leave you feeling like you've worked hard.  After two days, my whole body was sore, but in a good way.  It targeted muscles that my usual kickboxing workouts never reached, and this dvd is definitely capable of making you sweat.  I've tried various other yoga dvd's since starting with this one, and this one is still my favorite.  The other dvd's just don't make me feed like I'm working quite as much as this one.  This workout can also be worked on many levels. By that I mean that anyone can do the poses in this dvd because you only do them to your level of ability, and you can always push yourself farther.  So you never completely master a workout.  I think anyone interested in yoga who is looking for a challenging workout should try this dvd.",1140739200,4,921,4.376470588235295

He does really seem to love himself...there are several places in all three workouts where it flashes to just him and it becomes all black and white and he's all doing his yoga like he's ""Deeter"" in a Saturday Night Live spoof.

682178,5,6303548970,"Bryan Kest's third DVD ""Sweat""in this series was my first ever introduction to power yoga.  At that time I had never experienced yoga as challenging and would not recommend the third DVD to first time power yoga seekers.  The postures are advanced and the main model in the front is hyper-flexible which can lead to unrealistic expectations for an novice yogi. However, after reviewing all three DVD's Bryan Kests does a great job of building upon the previous DVD's skills so to prepare the yoga  practitioner with the base needed to advance forward.  This DVD also has soothing and consistent background music as well as very good aduio, which is often missing from other DVD's.  This is another must have in one's power yoga DVD collection.",1140739200,2,743,4.865079365079365

It is not for beginners and a great challenge for intermediate levels as myself.  I'm looking forward to trying more of Brian Kest's workouts! I highly recommend it.",1140652800,,293,4.509433962264151
682180,4,6303548970,"I was looking for a yoga DVD that had more flow to it and this DVD provides this, along with Brian's editorials throughout, especially helping the viewer to maintain focus on your breathing, attention to posture and motivation to stay with what is good for you as a person. I like that he drives the point home that every person is different with different abilities and to just push yourself to your own edge. He would have, however, driven this point home better if he had more of a variety of abilities in his class on the DVD. As an intermediate beginner myself, it can be a bit frustrating to have the models in his class be so very flexible and strong (maybe for one person that would be a motivator but they all do the postures so perfect and that can be a bit overwhelming or discouraging to someone just beginning yoga). It would also be nice to see someone not so advanced doing the same routine (seems like these models are more like professional dancers the way they can bend). If there were less advanced participants in the class you really don't see them since the camera pretty much stays on those who do the poses extremely well!

Well now that I've used the DVD several times and have become a bit familiar with it I find that I often choose not to look at the TV (and the super flexible models) but just use my ears to listen and just stay with my the flow on my own mat. Anyhow, the DVD sure is challenging and it has 3 parts. It's definately worth the purchase, now just put it to practice.",1140393600,2,1511,4.320422535211268
682181,4,6303548970,"I bought this DVD and two others around the same time. The other two were Yoga Shakti and Rodney Yee's intermediate yoga. This one is the best in terms of quality of workout and yoga authenticity. He does a good job of explaining and showing the details, which Shakti does not. Also Shakti seems to be more interpretation than traditional yoga, although I'm no expert either. With Kest be prepared for a good workout, but it will make you feel like you're accomplishing something. I also like the fact that he shows is students doing the workout with just him interspersed to demonstrate some of the key poses and he gives good, albeit somewhat corny dialog on the poses.

Here are the reasons why I did not give this 5 stars:
- He's a little too into his own looks. The ""look how sexy I am"" introduction is too long and pretty cheesey.
- I wish they'd have an option just to go to directly to the workout without the introduction.
- The first and second workouts seem pretty similar. A little more variety would be nice.
- I wish he also gave the sanskrit terms for the poses.

All around though I think this is a very good DVD. I wish he had a gentle yoga DVD as well for those days when I don't feel like doing such a hard workout. This DVD is also not for beginners unless you're particularly fit and flexible. But this is not a complaint because it's not supposed to be for beginners.",1140307200,9,1389,4.338461538461538

routine on DVD on the market. This DVD is extremely well done.

The music is great, the routines are incredible, and Brian explains and demonstrates the postures that provide all the

guidance required to achieve the ultimate Power Yoga workout.

There are 3 levels of routines, each one about 45 minutes, and provides all intensity required to satisfy either, your mood, or ability. These routines WILL make you feel ALIVE!!!!!

Especially great to enhance your ability in sports. If POWER is what you are after, this is what the name implies, POWER YOGA!!!",1140134400,,620,4.923076923076923
682243,5,6303548970,"Yeah, okay I'll admit it, I am Type A big time!  Yoga has never been my thing!  I'm not into ""imagining my arms are straws and drawing power from the earth"" as one new-age instructor said on a yoga video I recently tried, I don't have any need or desire to feel at one with the universe, and I certainly don't expect to have a spiritual experience worthy of a flood of tears after my workout.  What I do have is a very flexible body, a lot of energy and pent up stress that needs to be released.  The hardest part for me with yoga has always been ""quieting my mind.""  However, like I say, I can't just ""stand, breathe and be"" as I heard on yet another yoga workout.  What's a girl to do?  I guess the answer is find Bryan Kest!

I borrowed these workouts from my library and jumped right in with #3 - Sweat.  Fortunately, as I say, I am really flexible, and I've done enough yoga to be familiar with the breathing and the poses.  I made it through #3, didn't sweat much, but I sure loosened up!  I was able to hold and maintain most of the poses, although I defintely have some work to do on some of them.  I did #2 Tone a few days later, and in some ways I found that a little more difficult.  I think because of all the standing poses which are held for quite a while. I haven't tried #1 yet.

What I like about these workouts are that Bryan DOES give constant instruction!  (I see this fact has been debated in other reviews.)  Because of my basic knowledge of yoga poses, I was able to do the whole workout without looking at the TV except for occassional glances just to check my form.  If you really LISTEN to his instruction and follow them, anyone should be able to assume the pose.  (Okay, beginngers may need to take a few peeks at the TV to make sure they've got it right!)  To me Bryan's running commentary is soothing.  I'm way too hyper to listen to some soft, new-agey music and my own breathing!  I'll get bored way too fast this way.  Bryan is motivating, encouraging yet always reminding that we need to listen to our bodies.  To me, during the workout, I feel calm, I focus more on what I'm feeling and doing, and I can (usually) let my over active brain rest from thinking about the 8 zillion things I need/want to do.  Yet I'm not being preached at to ""feel the power"" or ""just be"" or pretend my body parts are anything other than what they are or that I am actually sucking power from the floor of my bedroom!

It depends on who you are and what you want, and I know there are a lot of people who practice yoga for that spiritual aspect.  I'm just not one of them, and for those of you like me who want the benefits of yoga without the other stuff, these are great workouts!  I get an awesome stretch, increased flexibility, increased power (these workouts will definitely strengthen your muscles - particularly in the legs), and a calm mind.  When the workout is over, I feel loose, open, relaxed yet energetic and just plain good!  (Kudos to you people doing these first thing in the morning!  There is NO WAY I could move smoothly through them with morning tightness! I find mid-afternoon to early evening to be my best time with them.  I do cardio in the morning!)

And finally, c'mon guys!  Making of fun of his hair and a possible speech impediment!  What's with that?  I actually like Bryan's voice.  He's not bad to look at either.  And the hair?  Heck, I've got the same wild, natural curls.  Bryan's ""look"" might not be for everyone -- but he's a yoga instructor not your date!

These workouts are just plain awesome!  If you're anything like me and are searching for some yoga you can and will do, this is it!",1139961600,43,3642,4.258394160583942
682244,5,6303548970,"I did a lot of research before buying my first yoga DVD; I saw that Brian Kest's Yoga collection had great reviews and decided to try it. I did not think that I'd ever turn into a yoga fanatic, but this DVD makes me want to get up and practice every morning! I simply LOVE it. Just after 1 month of practicing with this set, I've noticed such a difference in my strength and flexibility. My arms have always been very weak, and this is the first time I have ever noticed muscle tone in my arms! This is such an amazing all-over body workout.

When you first watch the videos, you will notice the incredible muscle tone in all the men and women performing the poses. It is truely amazing what strength you can build without weights; with just your mind and body.

When I moved far from the gym and got a full time job, I decided to start working out at home.  I have to say that I had carpal tunnel syndrome on my right hand and tindonitis on my left hand/arm.  This encouraged me to do yoga to strengthen my weakened hands/arms.  After buying a number of different yoga DVDs I finally found Brian, and he has kept me going ever since.  I wake up every morning before 6am, plug in the DVD and choose any of the three classes.  The three are challenging in different ways, but Brian keeps me motivated because he keeps saying: it's Ok, do what you can do, it's not about the pose, it's about calmness within sensation...Thanks to him, my back, arms, shoulders and hands don't hurt any more and I can just feel happy, strong and calm throughout the day.

I started off with an AM/PM DVD with Rodney Yee and enjoyed it but did not feel very challenged.  I moved to a Power Yoga DVD by Rodney Yee and found it very challenging.  I did that for about 6 months and then needed something different.  Bryan Kest instructs more during the video then Rodney.  He walks you through all of the posses and makes you really feel part of his class.  Rodney goes through the posses with out any type of conversation.  If you need encouragement during your workout then this Power Yoga would be a great choice.  The DVD has three workouts each one harder then the next.,1138665600,3,687,4.3125
682248,4,6303548970,I haven't actually done the workout yet but I have watched it through entirely first and I have tried more than enough yoga videos to know I will definitely be using this one for a long time to come. It really isn't for total beginners of power yoga...for that I would highly recommend Sean corns which is a great instructional video (I noticed that she is one of the class members in this video and she is awesome!). Once you've done that one a few times though you are ready for this one. I can see Brian does talk a little to much but once you do it a couple of times you could probably tune him out a little. I am really looking forward to doing these as I have tried others but didn't like that the poses weren't held for long enough. This would be 5 stars if he would choreograph a class and add his voice in later. Maybe then he would only speak as much as is absolutely necessary to just simply quide you into the poses and not chatter on unnecessarily.,1138492800,2,961,4.172043010752688
682249,1,6303548970,The programs on Bryan Kests DVD are movitating and challenging.  I would not recommend this for true beginner as it assumes knowledge of alignment in certain poses.  This is challenging enough for an intermediate practice-but not our of reach for an advanced beginner if they follow the verbal cues to respect thier body and to not try to work beyond their limits.,1138492800,3,364,4.854838709677419
682250,2,6303548970,"With his rushed delivery and his aggressive, boyish swagger, it was a little hard to take Kest seriously.  I tried to at least give the DVD a chance, and do the 1st level through to the end, but I found that even for all the words Kest was cramming into the available amount of time, he failed to teach the poses in a manner appropiriate for beginners to learn the poses safely and correctly.  For the experienced practitioner, his chatter was distracting and even patronizing.

One demographic this DVD may appeal to however, is people who think they're too ""manly"" to do yoga--still, this DVD would be better as an intro rather than a CD to practice regularly with.",1137283200,4,667,4.588235294117647
682251,5,6303548970,"I have been practicing yoga on and off for 8 years.  I am a mother of two and I can't afford the money or the time to practice at a studio.  I have been in search for a yoga dvd to do at home and I have found it!  After reading all the reviews for this dvd and realizing that I could get three classes for less than the price of one,  I was very motivated to order it and was not dissapointed in the least.  Bryan Kest is a wonderful instructor and his attention to detail in describing sep by step the asanas as they occur is unlike any other class or dvd I have experienced.  Some have said that he talks to much.  I for one benefit more from a practice when the teacher can offer me information that will aid my experience with the way I approach yoga.  His constant remider to ""be where you are"" are very reasurring.  While I agree that this dvd set is indeed not for true beginners, there is nothing suggesting that it is, it very well suited for me, an on again off again practicioner.  As for the comments others have made that he gropes his students or that he is too touchy feely, a great instructor is supposed to assist his or her students in achieving the poses to best of their abilities and if that means that he or she has to put their hands on you then so be it.  Besides, of of the greatest purposes of yoga is to let go of ego and judgement.  It is my opinion that letting go of these two things in particular will make us all better people to ourselves and others around us.  For me, practicing yoga is a spiritual experience.  I have never felt as united with the universe as I do when I have a good yoga practice.  There was a point during this practice (I have only tried the first one of the three) where I felt very humbled and vulnerable and was moved to tears.  For me, nothing feels as right as that.  If we all learn to let go a bit, we will find that our life will change, if it needs changing.  I applaud you Bryan, job extremely well done.  I look forward to practicing with you for a long time to come!",1137196800,3,2034,4.052631578947368

His constant reminders to release stress and not let your ego judge during the workout is comforting.  He stresses, not form so much and what you look like, but what it feels like.  It might have been nice for him to review 'proper breathing' during yoga workouts, but he is not rigid in his instruction.  The pace is good.  I was plenty warm after the first run through of poses.  Glad I purchased this one.",1136592000,3,585,4.462264150943396
682313,4,6303548970,"I recently purchased this DVD as part of a Christmas present to myself to get back to or exceed the level of fitness I had in my early 20s -- I am now in my mid-to-late 30s.  I have to admit that this workout is very challenging at not just Levels Two and Three, but Level One as well.

As some of you who may have purchased Diamond Dallas Page's Yoga for Regular Guys know, this particular yoga instructor's method was recommended by DDP himself in the beginning chapters of his book.  Page himself used Kest's ""tapes"" when he first started doing yoga, and I, in turn, wanted to do the same as to vary my workouts and avoid complacency.

I love that Kest encourages beginners like myself to go as far as we can into the poses so that we are still challenging ourselves to become more flexible and go into the poses deeper.  One thing I did notice that concerned me was that modified poses for what I considered some of the more difficult balancing poses -- namely the left and right tree stances -- had no modifications.  I may have to purchase another workout that does include those.  Still, Kest does encourage his students to know when and when not to push themselves, especially if the student's breathing is not steady and relaxed.

Nevertheless, I know I will eventually get stronger, more flexible, and improve my stamina with each workout session via Bryan's methods among others.

Oh! For all of you other potential regular guy yogis out there along the same mindset of DDP and his crew, there are very hot yoga babes in every portion of this collection to inspire you to greet them with ""T & A"" -- or was that ""namaste?""

Overall, I love this workout.  Again, it is very challenging at even the beginner level, has incredibly hot and fit yoga babes, and most importantly encourages practitioners to know when to challenge themselves or to ease up.

Every single one of the workouts are so complete and thorough in just 50 minutes , I feel every single muscle in my body afterwards. The 3 three yoga workouts in the dvd  are getting gradually more intense but all of them are challenging in one way or another and I usually do 2 or all 3 in one week alongside other yoga dvds.

Some people are put off by the touching (?).  Well, if you've ever taken any sort of ballet or modern dance, you know that the instructors ALWAYS handle you in very personal ways. It is completely non-sexual; they just want the correct form. Sometimes you have to manipulate the figure for the pose to be effective.

I watched the first yoga set, Energize, before I tried it.  While I was watching the moves, I kept thinking about how easy it looked and that I could definitely do that stuff.  Then I actually tried it.  And found out that I was totally wrong.  It's not easy, especially for one who has an extremely poor sense of balance.  Bryan puts you in a pose and has you hold it for what seems like forever, long enough that your legs and arms are crying from the contraction.  But it's worth it; I have more muscle tone in my arms and upper back since I started this.  I feel more relaxed and in tune that I ever did with the Firm and I actually look forward to working out again.

For those people who gripe about Bryan talking the whole time through...the first time I did this DVD, I felt that the monologue was kind of cheesy and unnecessary.  But, I have come to realize that his voice really helps me get into that relaxation frame of mind, so I don't mind it anymore.

I recommend this as a good intermediate level workout.  I was a beginner and could barely finish; the next day, I was extremely sore from the stretching and moving.  So it's definitely not a new-to-yoga DVD.",1127865600,6,1357,4.308300395256917

It leaves you feeling so wonderfully worked out at every level and fantastically relaxed at the same time - totally priceless.  The length, variety and combination of poses involved are perfect in providing a good workout despite my relative inflexibility as a 43 year old who hasn't done yoga for 18 years.

Just that gem has enabled me to powerfully relax and shift to sheer joy despite my limitations, both during the workout and in life - an amazing turnaround for a previously hard-core perfectionistic over-achiever.  His reminders of the benefits of keeping a calm mind and staying non-reactive even when in the midst of working one's body or facing life's challenges, have also been priceless and immediately beneficial, both in my yoga practice and life.

In my teen years and early twenties, I used to do a lot of hatha and then Iyengar yoga, but over time I found more intensive forms of exercise such as jazz ballet and ballroom dancing preferable.  Foot injuries forced me to stop dancing but every yoga tape and class I tried over the years didn't do enough for me to make it worth continuing.  This is why I am amazed to find this program so powerful that it is now my favourite form of exercising despite up to now thinking yoga no longer hit the spot for me.  Thanks Bryan and Amzon for helping me discover this gem thanks to the wonderful reviews I found in my search for Ashtanga yoga DVDs once my niece turned me on to the power of that form of yoga.  Due to some wrist problems, I find this DVD better and easier to do than pure Ashtanga yoga as the sun salutations are more spread out, making it easier to pull off without further straining my left wrist.  I also prefer the greater variety that results in their being more interspersed through different poses instead of needing to first do 10 full sun salutations in a row before getting to other poses.",1126483200,15,2522,4.607142857142857
682377,4,6303548970,"This collection is a great buy for any intermediate to advanced practioner.  All three practices are challenging, yet Kest does a great job of giving modifications or places for beginners to back off as needed.  Let's face it, we don't always have time for a full 90 minute practice, but it's much better to get on your mat for 53 minutes than none at all!  Which is about how long each class lasts.  My only criticism...why not a full hour? The closings seem just a bit rushed, but that's what the ""pause"" button is for; add your own inversions, etc.  Sometimes you just need a good sweat, and these classes do just that!",1126396800,6,622,4.469026548672566

He holds the pose longer than most DVDs.  Now, a few months later, downward facing Dog positions feels like I'm taking a break!  I've made so much progress in a short amount of time.  It may seem tough at first if you are a beginner, but hang in there because you will progress if you use the workouts frequently.",1126224000,8,491,4.21505376344086
682379,5,6303548970,"I can understand how participants in Bryan Kest's Power Yoga might find their feelings about him polarized by his Rock Star good looks, intensity and hippie-empathy. But he is offering instruction in Power-Yoga and one would think that his charismatic qualities would imminently qualify him to be one of the Pied Piper's of Power-Yoga along with stars such as Baron Baptiste whom I have a sense may have been a major source of inspiration for Bryan in his quest to bring the benefits of Yoga to all of us.

HIS VOICE

One reviewer mentions that Bryan has a Jersey-Boy voice, but for me it comes across as if Bryan has a slight speech impediment, one he has invested a great deal of time and effort in overcoming. On occasion it is noticeable, but for the most part he speaks very well with an earnest concern for those of us who wish to practice along with his personal students. Bryan always takes a moment to introduce each of the sessions emphasizing the basic tenants of Yoga practice, which is a thoughtful touch since the students in his classes are capable of doing the poses in their most extreme extensions.

THE AMBIENCE

The instruction has been so artfully crafted that when I come home tired and stressed after a very long day I will watch Bryan's students go through the poses and after a little while I find myself transformed to the point where I join in and start exercising with the class.

The three sessions have been filmed inside what appears to be a converted nineteenth century warehouse. The slightly irregular bricks that make up the walls seem to be individually unique in their shapes and color variations and are separated from each other by a layer of thick white cement while rough-hewn beams are embedded in the walls breaking up the space in what at one time must have served a purpose. Banks of pebbled, frost-etched windows provide a sense of light and space. The wooden floor has sections where it is evident that large tables or machinery of what possibly may have been a long ago factory have been removed. And a huge Romanesque pipe crudely soldered abuts one section of a wall. Bryan has provided a visually pleasing and soothing space in which to practice his version of yoga.

The students are extremely attractive, stylishly attired in a range of clothing that perhaps mirrors their interests: gymnast, dancer, athlete and actor. Based on their physical appearance the DVD is an excellent source for artists who are interested in studying human anatomy. The student's paper-thin skin and finely detailed muscularity provide excellent sources for the artist, and since it is a DVD it can be viewed on a computer where frames can be frozen in order to capture a particular pose. In fact Bryan Kest has that really nice diamond shape in his back just below the latissimus dorsi and the external oblique. I encourage artists to purchase the DVD as an anatomy reference.

In Session 3 Sweat an extraordinary effort has been made to present an artistic film experience. The scene has been shot with a sepia filter and the ""cut to"" of Bryan holding a pose has him in an Andy Warhol genre-blue spotlight while the rest of the scene has been left with its natural lighting; very nice.

THE SESSIONS

Energize, Tone and Sweat mainly focus on the sun salutations,the on the floor pigeon which in this instruction is referred to as runner stretch, and standing twisting poses. Bryan does hold the positions for extended times providing the student the opportunity to develop greater strength, balance and flexibility. After any one of the sessions I always have that sense of equanimity Bryan mentions, which to me is proof that Bryan's series of instructions exercises a person's body and spirit on all levels from the muscular to the neurological.

FOR $14.98 BRYAN KEST HAS PROVIDED AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT CAN BE ENJOYED AS MANY TIMES AS THE STUDENT WISHES TO PARTICIPATE",1125792000,8,3912,4.79080118694362

The problem that compels me to give it only 3 stars is that nearly every time I glanced over to check my form, I was looking at the face and distractingly curly locks of Bryan Kest in close up.  He's not exactly hard on the eyes but when I'm practising yoga I need to see a full-body demonstration, not Bryan Kest wandering amidst the downward dog bottoms of his class, talking about yoga.

It's a bit hard to take Bryan seriously in his jean shorts (who wears that to yoga?), but the guy knows what he's talking about so he still makes a good teacher.",1124668800,4,370,4.796875

The only thing better than these DVD's is actually going to Bryans Santa Monica studio and practicing with him. This DVD collection is perfect for anyone just starting out or anyone looking to pepper up their ongoing practice. Bryan does talk a lot, but its only because hes so knowledgeable and he really does care. I had the honor of practicing at Bryans studio and I can honestly say that the Bryan on TV and the ""real-life"" Bryan are exactly the same!! My only complain is that, at 55 minutes these videos are too short for me. I'm one of these people who can actually set aside 90 minutes for yoga.(If you're like me, check out Bryans CD's. They're equally amazing!) These DVD's are well worth the price, especially when you see how beautifully produced they are. Your life will never be the same if you buy these DVD's.",1124496000,,946,4.704819277108434

682384,4,6303548970,"Many have criticized Kest but I don't care that he's a performer. A great yoga leader has to have a larger than life persona so I don't criticize him for his approach. Besides, these are great workouts, no doubt about it. I get into a huge sweat and feel great afterwards. At first I was turned off by the brassy instruction but I've grown used to it.  This DVD is for people with a background in exercise, not overweight inactive people who are just starting. If you want to test your limits, Kest does a good job.  One small flaw: The moves are done so quickly and the camera shots are so close-up, that it's impossible to replicate over 40% of the exercises. But after a half dozen times you can follow it.

For a beginner's level, easier-to-follow yoga workout, without  check out the Yoga Zone Premiere 4 Pack Collection.

Post Script: After viewing dozens of other power yoga DVDs I have to say this is the best one. So kudos to Bryan Kest. One more positive point: Unlike some of my yoga DVDs, this one, to its credit, does not require blocks, belts, chairs, etc. All you need is a mat. I hate yoga workouts where they don't warn you that you'll need a bunch of equipment. Suddenly the instructor is sitting in front of you with blocks or a belt. Happily, Kest's workout is streamlined and doesn't surprise you with sudden equipment requirements.",1124323200,99,1353,4.506122448979592
682445,5,6303548970,"For the past few years, I have been trying to find the perfect workout. I didn't think I could ever find it until I tried Bryan Kest's Power Yoga Complete Collection. Not only do I feel like I worked every muscle in my body, but I feel relaxed and calm afterwards. Unlike most forms of exercise, Yoga has no impact on your joints and does not stress your body like weight-lifting or running. You will start to build long lean muscles, much like a dancer.

The first DVD in his series is labeled beginner. The beauty about this DVD is that you can make it as beginner or as advanced as you want. The same holds true for the entire series. The principle he instills is that you can make each pose easy for yourself by not pushing yourself too hard. He further emphasizes that Yoga is not about being strong or flexible but about feeling something. You will hear Bryan say that all you need to do is move and sweat to do Yoga perfectly.

The second DVD (intermediate) is more challenging than the first. It has a faster pace because it leads into successive poses much more quickly. The third (advanced) and last DVD is definitely challenging. I am not quite there yet, but have no doubts that I will be regularly following the third DVD soon.

I urge you to buy this DVD. You will fall in love with the practice of Power Yoga. I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life.",1120608000,9,1377,4.308880308880309
682446,3,6303548970,"I bought this dvd b/c I don't always have the time to make it to a yoga class and I've tried too many new instructors who are not exactly great.  I have to say while the dvd is very challenging, but I am not exactly satisfied.
The biggest problem is that the video is really boring.  There's too much time in the relaxation poses, too little time in the strength and balance poses, and too much of Krest repeating the same thing over and over again.  It makes it hard to want to go through it again the next day.
I've been doing yoga on and off for 4 years now and I found the transitions between poses awkward and hard to adapt to especially on days when I'm not feeling flexible or strong.
Also, maybe it's just me, but is Krest annoying or what?  I'm not sure it's the cutoff or the white unitards.  Basically, I didn't really like the energy in the video.
One good thing is I do build up a sweat and the dvd has 3 different workouts for whatever level you are at.",1119657600,9,967,4.122340425531915
682447,5,6303548970,"I don't usually listen when people are talking, but Bryan Kest's words and advice on yoga demand your attention. He is a master teacher who keeps the viewer calm and builds your esteem up with his constant words of praise and wisdom. Hearing Kest say ""If your doing the best you can, you're doing this class perfectly"" is exactly what I need to hear while doing my practice. Aside from his words of encouragement, Kest takes the viewer through a rigorous workout through each of his three programs. I am thoroughly drenched in sweat after any of the three programs on this DVD. The best part about this DVD is that it also calms the mind as well as strengthens the body. I have lost a considerable amount of weight since beginning this program (20 lbs) and feel great. Beginners may be overwhelmed at first, but give Kest some time and you will soon realize that you are listening to a master who will guide you to be the best yogi you can be. Some of the criticisms leveled towards this DVD are unwarranted. First, the way Kest positions or touches his students are to maximize the effect of the poses that they are demonstrating, any suggestions that he is groping his students are juvenile, immature and are simply missing Kest's greater message. Second, who cares what kind of accent the guy has or if he's wearing jeans...I mean can we be any more fickle? Overall, this is the best Yoga DVD on the market period, it grows with you and always allows you to take your practice to the next level. At a very reasonable price you can own this DVD which allows you access to one of the best yoga teachers out there. Highly Recommended.",1119312000,16,1634,4.505050505050505
682448,4,6303548970,"I agree with the reviewers who say this is not for a rank beginner -- you'll get a lot more out of it if you already have some idea of Sun Salute A and B and how you, personally, need to modify them if at all.  Since there is little instruction on proper form, you also need to avoid getting carried away and trying to do more than you are capable of.

The first time I tried it, I thought I was going to die!  When I came back to it after working with some more instructional DVDs and a good handle on the sun salutes I found it challenging, but approachable.  It grows with you if you are an intermediate beginner.

This isn't aerobics, but it is the most fast-paced and agressive of the small collection of yoga DVDs I have amassed.  I definitely sweat, and I think anyone who is really WORKING the poses and not just going through the motions will feel the practice.  As Kest says, the poses are endless.  You can always go as deep -- or not -- as is appropriate for you.  But you need to have some understanding of how deep that is to do this workout safely and effectively.

Kest's style will appeal to some and not to others.  I find him nice eye candy and the voice grew on me.  His message is right on and I prefer a more physical and less meditative approach.",1119312000,4,1269,4.134693877551021

Although this is a fairly good workout, its so different from what I'm used to.  The sequence of asanas didn't have a natural flow, but it could be because its not what I'm accustomed to.  I find he holds the relaxing poses too long, and the strength building poses, he's in and out of too quickly. What drove me crazy was Kest's incessant chatter.  Part of yoga is being quiet.  Its one thing to direct someone in the asanas, but this guy goes on and on about nonsense.  Yoga is a personal journey and I find it mind numbing, even in a real class when an instructor tells you what you should be feeling.  I'll continue with the dvd and as soon as I'm familiar with the sequence, I'll be hitting that mute button.  This will be good when I travel.",1118707200,14,864,4.219512195121951
682450,5,6303548970,"I am a 26 year old of average fitness.  I would consider myself a beginner, although not a true beginner.  I found this DVD to be one of, if not the best Yoga DVD available.  The workouts are exceptional and are not only relaxing but very effective for conditioning and strengthening (having come from years of weight conditioning).  You can make these workouts as hard as you want by pushing the edge further.  In fact, I have only stuck with the first of the 3 included workouts because it has been good enough for me and I have seen consistent improvements in my strength and flexibility for some time now.  I amazed to think that there are still 2 more workouts.  It will take some time for me to feel comfortable completing all of the 50 minute sessions.

There is a lot of depth in these 3 workouts, unmatched by any other videos of the same price and quality.  Kest's instructions are encouraging and the most thorough outside of the most beginner of Yoga DVD's.  I don't get as lost as I do in other videos, and when I do, I can generally look up and see some appropriate examples of how to make the right adjustments.  The video does a great job of making you feel like you are dropping in on a live class where the instruction is also being directed at you.

The quality of the video is average and the indexing of the workouts is basic, that is, there is no way to get straight into the workout without first hearing the intro speech by Kest, which although is useful, can get old after a dozen times.  I just fast forward to the right time index and then I'm set.  Additionally the music and the outfits are a bit dated.  All around, however, these small details don't bug me, I don't think it's in my right yogic mind to make those a concern.  The workout is superb, the instruction, in my opinion is unmatched in its thoughtfullness and detail, and Kest's personality and way of speaking becomes fairly endearing after some time.

There are better videos for true beginniners, like the Yoga for dummies series, but after you've passed the level of those, which is often fairly quickly, I highly recommend you get Kest's Power Yoga and keep it for a while.  You can probably jump into the video after a few weeks of beginner instruction and it will take you years to feel like you are comfortable with the entire video.  A great value all around.  Get it.",1117152000,,2368,4.424942263279446
682451,3,6303548970,"I decided to buy this DVD when my regular yoga studio was bought out by a gym and non-gym members could no longer attend.

ADVANTAGES

I would agree with many of the previous reviewers - his workout is really good.  I started at the beginner level and what he led us through was on par with what I was doing in the beginning level classes I was taking at the yoga studio.  He leads you through a lot of stretches and poses that exercise different parts of your body, which I really liked.  At the end of the workout, I always feel relaxed and flexible.

DISADVANTAGES

The biggest problem I had with his workout video was his extra commentary.  He verbally leads you through the poses, and that part is actually very helpful.  Just by listening to him, I can often do exactly what is on the screen.  What drove me nuts were the parts where he starts rambling on and on about only doing what your ability could do and how this was okay and that was okay and something else was okay.  I just wanted him to lead me through the pose, and not ramble on about karma and whatnot.

Overall, his workout is quite good, if I could figure out how to edit out the parts where he just talks!",1116201600,7,1178,4.233183856502242
682452,5,6303548970,"I live in a remote area, have no access to a live yoga class and rely entirely on video instruction. Over the years, I have complied an extensive library of instructional yoga videos/dvds, and this series remains one of my favorites. Kest is a fabulous instructor who narrates his class with a clean sense of timing and a knack for saying what the student needs to hear at the precise moment. If you are a total beginner, however, this may not be the best place to start, because all three sessions are fairly challenging, and the pace is too fast for somebody who is still learning the sequence of a vinyasa. For the intermediate student, however, I cannot recommend this instruction highly enough. The sequencing just ""feels right""; it flows naturally. The music is the perfect mix of energizing and calming, reflecting the practice itself. I come away from this practice feeling pleasently ""wrung out"" and having worked up a good sweat every time. All three sessions are roughly 1 hour in length.",1115942400,6,999,4.780346820809249
682453,4,6303548970,"I've tried other yoga tapes, including the best selling yoga tape of all time, ""Yoga Mind & Body"" by Ali McGraw, and ones by Rodney Yee -- and Bryan Kest's are the best I've done. I should say I'm in my 20s, so I don't know how this workout would be for an older person, but I found workout #1 to be the perfect starting place. It's easy enough to do without getting frustrated, and it's difficult enough to get a good workout. I hadn't done any yoga before I tried #1, and I did fall and couldn't hold the poses for very long at first. I could still keep up with the workout, and it took just a few times before I could do the tape all the way through.

The way Bryan works is he tells you the basics of a pose, the VERY basics, gets you into the pose, and then goes into more depth while you're in it, so you can modify after you're in the pose. I think this is great because you're not just standing around while he talks about poses. The beginning of each tape is a lot of up- and down-dog poses with sun salutations and back and leg stretches in between. It's fast in order to get your heart rate up quickly and get your muscles warm for stretching.

I've done all 3 workouts, and I must admit I don't like #2. My friend, who is great at yoga, and does #3 daily, also doesn't like #2. It is really leg intensive. I mean you won't be able to stand afterwards without your legs shaking. It's too much, I think -- and I can see that #3 is a harder version of #1, but #2 isn't a transition workout, it's completely different, and too heavy on the leg work. This is okay though, because I could go from #1 to #3 easily once I had mastered the first one.

There are some poses in #3 that are very hard. Like the back bend, and holding your foot up over your head while standing on the other leg. But there are modifications, or the difficult poses are versions of easier poses in #1 that you will remember, and you can always do those instead when you get to the hard stuff. Not to say it can't be done. My friend has stuck with these workouts more than I have -- when we started we were losing our balance and coming out of down-dog before Bryan said to because we were so tired. Now she can do all of #3 and I can do most of it, using the simpler poses from #1 for the harder stuff.

All of these workouts are 50 minutes long, but if you're looking for a quick 30 minute workout on some days, the first 30 minutes of #1 is a great and complete one.

BTW, this is truly POWER yoga, you will feel tired yet invigorated when you are done. Good luck!",1115856000,12,2547,4.035643564356436
682454,4,6303548970,"I was surprised to see that almost 1/2 the class in each program was men. Nice to see teachers proving that yoga is for men as well. The classes are done in what seems an warehouse with maybe purposely artsy very slightly grainy video to add to the warehouse industrial theme. All the students are in supreme shape in white tight outfits for an artsy look. The music has a heavy beat which is great for grounding, but is too complicated/too fast a tempo to be soothing.

He has a good voice overall in my opinion, repeatedly tells you to always moving at your own pace which is great, but he does it too much. He keeps talking, pretty fast, barely breathes himself, probably from over trying, but he means well. His voice isn't soothing at first feel, actually tense, but only perhaps because of the camera... I think he needs to stop trying so hard & lay off the sugar &/or caffeine.

The fact that the pace is good, he's not boring, etc. & really passionate about yoga, patience, etc. helps. But I can't tell how much body awareness he has. This would be great DVD for tense men who are afraid to be the only guy doing the workout & will feel more at home & less annoyed because they can't get into calming, soothing yoga dvds. This is NOT for beginners due to the lack of detailed cues & speed. This is best for strong/advanced beginners or intermediates.

I'm not sure where some people got creeped out by Bryan, he's not as bad as Baron in terms of touching other students. Baron feels like a molester, a gf couldn't even watch & I am sensitive as well. Bryan definitely is not creepy.
If anyone has taken a yoga class, the point of taking a class verses video IS that the teacher pulls you in the correct form so you don't hurt yourself so you can FEEL your own body in the right posture. It's quicker & easier then to use verbal instruction so they can help OTHERS in the class as well in that short time.

Energize Disk 1 - (almost this order) - introduction for sun salutations (lot of plank, upward dog, downward dog mostly), chair (for only split seconds), several warrior 1, warrior 2, bound side angle, triangle, bound triangle, revolved triangle, pigeon, standing wide legged bend, prayer hands behind back standing hip stretch, prayer twist, tree, boat, camel, hero, sitting fwd bend, reclined spinal twist & ends w/2 min relaxation.

The cons are that his voice isn't soothing like Rodney yee, Shiva Rea, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, etc. nor allows much silence. Also it's not HIM doing the workout, though cuts to him alone for a few seconds for each pose. He just walks around which I don't like as much. At least he uses advanced yoga students as demonstrators, so they at least have good form. Take off more stars if you like quiet reflection & calmness to relax your own body which is the goal of yoga.

He never lets you just stop to take in some of the postures before his voice makes its way into your head.

She said it would help my surfing (its great for all sports) because it would improve my balance and flexibility and more importantly help me relieve stress from work.

What an AMAZING workout this is....I am completely drenched by the time the ""beginners"" workout wraps up and honestly I sleep like a baby on the nights I do yoga !! And, my balance and endurance have improved as well.....very noticeable in my surfing and mt. biking!!!

Bryan's approach is fantastic....he encourages you to push yourself but helps you realize that we are all built a little different so we will look different in the poses.  I'm a believer...yoga opens up your mind, loosens tight muscles, relieves stress and definitely improves your balance....this surfer boy is completely addicted to the stuff.  I still don't think I'll be buying a unitard anytime soon, but I do highly recommend the Bryan Kest system to everyone....especially former mucscleheads like myself that are looking for a healthy, fun and accessible form of yoga !!

And you gawda remembah that da breath is very impooortent...""  I almost didn't buy this DVD based on that review, but I am very glad that I bought it anyway.  Brian's voice is fine, and his commentary is appropriate and inspiring.  This DVD is highly recommended!",1114041600,6,729,4.569230769230769
682557,5,6303548970,"I am not a yoga expert, but I have been practicing various forms of yoga for the past 10 years or so on an off and on basis. But with this DVD, it's the first time that I am able to stick with it and do it about 3 times a week.

First of all, the length is perfect because most yoga workouts are extremely long and when you have a very tight schedule, its hard to fit in a 90 minute workout. These workouts are around 50 minutes each. I started out with ""Energize"", the first program and I found it to be quite challenging, it made me break out a significant sweat and I was sore all over the next day. As I got used to it, I moved on to the 2nd one, ""Tone"" and I stayed with it until I felt more comfortable with it. I am now doing #3, ""Sweat"" and I find it to be very strenuous, but I am able to go through it non-stop. I do break a great sweat and it works every muscle in your body.

I do agree that Bryan is a bit ""touchy-feely"" but who cares???? You're not supposed to be paying attention to that anyway... you're supposed to be focused on your yoga practice for the day! Besides, you will find it is very difficult to be holding most your body weight on your head while your trying to watch the TV. I find his words to be comforting and soothing and his instructions are very precise and helpful.

These workouts provide great cardiovascular activity as well as toning and when you do it consistently (along with a healthy diet, of course) you will shed pounds and tone your muscles and you will obtain a long, lean figure. Bryan Kest's Power Yoga shapes your body beautifully, making it a great workout for your body as well as your mind.",1112832000,8,1646,4.105590062111801
682558,4,6303548970,"I've been using this video for a long time and the longer I use it, the more annoyed I become with Bryan.  Maybe it's because I can recite the entire video word for word and hearing myself say his words make me realize how stupid it sounds.  He drives me insane.  I do think that some of previous reviewers were right in saying that he's an egomaniac.  And I'm surprised no one has mentioned how ridiculous his girlfriend is.  She cracks me up with her posing and fancy flair moves.  I can just picture these two going to juice bars and expecting everyone to recognize them and treat them like stars.

Other than Bryan and his heavily researched thesaurus-based monologues, this is a great workout and would only be better if you could follow it on mute.",1111276800,3,754,4.45985401459854

But the Kest videos have things I can't do.  It actually pushes me.

However, the bare-chested, hair flowing, sepia tone production aspect is wicked cheesy.  But!  If you're actually focused on your stance and your breathing you aren't looking at the screen.",1109548800,,436,4.584415584415584

682562,5,6303548970,"I love yoga, and I have many dvds since I am always experimenting, I also workout 6 days a week but this dvd just made me sweet like crazy. I thought I was in good shape and I thought I was pretty flexible until I tried this. It is really good and you don't have time to look at the tv and you don't really need it. The cues are really good and Bryan holds the poses long enough for you to feel something going on in your body unlike other videos I have when the instructors rush from pose to pose and you end up confused and tired.

682563,5,6303548970,"First and foremost, this DVD is a great deal, with three rigorous 50 minute-ish workouts for the price equivalent of some single-workout 50-minute dvds/tapes.  The instructions are clear and helpful and not at all distracting.  The pace is good - i would identify myself as an intermediate yogi who still tips on balancing poses and can't quite get crow pose.  The three workouts definitely have their own distinct feel and although some of the poses are the same, the duration of holding them, the order in which they're done, and other modifications make it so that I can rotate the three different segments throughout the week and not get bored.

One warning is that I found the second segment, ""tone,"" MUCH more difficult than the 3rd, ""Sweat,"" which is supposed to be the most advanced.  He really has you hold the poses for so long, demanding a LOT of stamina and endurance for what was described as intermediate.

Another note - because these were tapes transferred to DVD, they got a little lazy with the skip function, and ""skipping"" brings you to the next workout, not the next set of poses (whereas other dvds divide the workouts into segments you can skip to, like ""sun salutations,"" ""twisting poses,"" ""balancing poses,"" etc.)  This is somewhat annoying. The lack of skip function also means that the viewer is subject to a montage of Bryan skulkily pacing around an urban roofdeck that somehow contains tumbleweed.

While the commentary is not distracting, the visuals definitely are. As many have said, the ""help"" Kest provides to the students is hilariously akin to fondling.  also, I prefer not to count the ribs of the female students who wear little more than skimpy bras, and the thong leotard worn by one student is just wrong.  So if you prefer not to punctuate your yoga practice with chuckles, try to avert your eyes from the TV after you have the routine down pretty well.

Despite it's quirks, the workout is challenging and invigorating, and definitely worth the price.",1107475200,23,1995,4.838235294117647

While, of course, both Brian and all his hand-picked students have perfect bodies, he does go out of his way to explain some easier versions of poses and stresses that no one should push themselves to the point of injury.

The best part of his yoga program is how Brian explains what you should be feeling in all of the poses - it's this essential component that is often missing in many books or videos that simply explain the ""ideal"" form, and it's what makes the difference in real yoga classes.

If you have any questions or don't understand, Brian and his students are there in live action to show you exactly how to do some of the more difficult transitions.

I really like a lot of Brian's ideas and combinations and have added some of them to my basic, wake-up sun salutation.

I have been to a few Yoga classes, and was prepared for a workout, but didn't expect it to be this good.  Byran talks you through every pose, and there are his demonstrations edited into the video for further instruction.  The style of the video is very artistic.  Well done.

This was some good entertainment while I was holding some of the most difficult poses I have ever done in my life! I've only been doing yoga for a few months and still call myself a beginner, but my goodness am I sore after trying this DVD out yesterday for the first time. It's really hard to hold a downward dog for like a half hour while laughing at Brian's Michael Bolton locks and blue jeans :) The man knows his stuff though and designed a great workout- and who says that working out can't also be entertainment?",1104192000,6,601,4.280701754385965

I love the speed of the workout because I think it is challenging but not overly so.

682633,5,6303548970,"I have only done 2 out of 3 workouts so far ""Energize"" and ""Tone"" so I can't speak to all of this, but I liked the first two. What was odd to me was that the second seemed far easier than the first. I was surprised- I thought I'd be working up a ladder. ""Energize"" really gives me a workout, and I am in the intermediate range. It's really invigorating with a lot of emphasis on sun salutations with pushups, lunges, warror 1, etc. I'm pretty well worked out after just that portion. (Tone takes it a little easier in this arena). Kest can be a little annoying, and he does man-handle his students (male and female- he seems to take turns- in ""Energize"" he positions the women, in ""Tone"" the men get it), but he's thorough and explains clearly. He's also good at reminding students/viewers what the point of yoga is and what they should be focusing on. Yoga in jeans though? Ouch ;> After doing this workout I felt like my body was aligned differently and I stood taller. Recommended! This is one of my weekly staples. I just wish hitting the chapter button skipped past the introductions (I don't need the glamour shots of Bryan every time) rather than skipping between workouts so I didn't always have to fast forward.

It helped me bring balance into the way I exercise.  Fitness is about being fit, not about how much wieght you can throw around and how many reps you can do.

The workouts are just the right length of time.  I'd recommend this collection over KEST's Yoga for Weight Loss and Body Sculpting Yoga because these are basic, challenging but doable by beginner-intermediate level.  For really, really beginner's I'd recommend Ali MacGraw Yoga Mind and Body and Living Arts Total Yoga featuring Tracey Rich.

Many people have also made comments about the ""look"" of the video be it about Brian or the students and they have been both positive and negative comments. I ask you what does this really have to do with the instruction of the video? I do not know. It seems off base when the video was not made to be a model review.

I do think you'd need to have at least some working knowledge of yoga poses (ie: you've taken at least one or two yoga classes in the past or done a Rodney Yee tape or two) to begin with tape 1. But even if you don't, Bryan is a wonderful instructor who puts anyone at ease with his calm reassurances that you can do this at your own pace and take breaks when you need to. As he says repeatedly throughout the series - this is your workout, you do what you need to do.
Tape 2 is my favorite and I've already had to replace it once because it got warped from how much I used it. It's a full 50 minutes of make-you-sweat yoga with challenging poses and variations. At no point do you feel like the workout is too easy. Bryan keeps it flowing throughout from one pose to the next. There are a lot of sun salutations, though, so be forewarned.
I still have to try Tape 3. I love tape 2 so much though that I feel comfortable sticking with it. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking to be challenged and taken out of an easy comfort zone with yoga.

Bryan Kest is very clear about you taking things at your pace and as you start to do the workouts on a regular basis you begin to notice that you are stretching further - loosening up -feeling great and before you know it - you are achieving those poses you once thought impossible.  I found his videos particularly useful because I am tired of buying DVDs Videos that within a few weeks you feel cannot stretch your abilities any futher - that there is nothing left for you to achieve.  In Mr. Kests videos you always feel that there is another level to be reach.
Some have criticised the way he touches people on the video or the way he is dressed.  Well, he is an instructor - and to be able to correct and improve people's positions - there is a need to touch the student - or are we now so politically correct that you expect him use a cue stick to indicate changes that need to take place?!  Besides all of that - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EXERCISING - NOT SITTING! When you are exercising you barely have time to note the touching or the dress code.  And quite frankly - if Mr Keats wants to reveal to the world what yoga had done for the toning of his body - then go for it.  His later DVDs have obviously taken those criticisms into consideration as he is wearing a t-shirt and long pants!

I found the set to be challenging but Bryan Kest is encouraging and describes modifications to make it easier as well as harder. It's a set I could do for quite some time- it leaves room for even the advanced to improve. The first video is the easiest. The second really tones- especially the legs. The last video definately makes you sweat. It is very challenging and I save it for the days I want a really good workout. I'm fitting in to jeans I haven't wore for 2 years just from this set of videos. Not only is it trimming down my size but also makes me feel good! It's empowering!",1040169600,8,711,4.235294117647059
682825,5,6303548970,"This was my first attempt at Ashtanga (Power) Yoga.  I am a fan of Hatha and Ali's set.  This tape brought me out of a heavy feeling I had been carrying for some time.  I stretched and sweat and moved as much into the poses as I could.  My body loved it.  I am sore tonight but I recommend this to ANYONE who is SERIOUS about not only shaping and toning your body but controlling your stress levels and racing thoughts.  If you are attempting to reconnect with yourself and your body...this is the box set for you.  Did I mention that I got so into it that I am using a heating pad tonight?  And did I mention that immediately after doing it, I wanted to use the energy I produced while working out?  Did I mention how wonderfully perfect Brian Kest is?

682826,5,6303548970,"I jokingly call this program 'Stud Muffin Yoga'.  No puzzle as to why--Brian Kest is wonderful to look at.  However, he is not the proverbial pretty face and hot bod--his program is envigorating and extremely satisfying.  His supple, taut and muscular body wonderfully advertises the obvious advantages of following his Power Yoga regime.  His program consists of a brief introduction where Kest emphasizes the importance of breathing properly and understanding that none of the poses that he demonstrates need be done with the exact accuracy of his team of on-tape students.  He stresses the need to let go of your pride and competitiveness and simply ""be"" in the pose and let your breath do the rest to relax and nurture you.  After some struggle with my own ego to let go, I found that it works.  I was able to stop thinking and just go with the flow of the music and the echo of deep breathing that acts like a metronome throughout the tapes.
His base consists of repetitions of the sun salutation series, moving sinously from mountain pose through downward facing dog.  From this base he moves through the warrior series, and other poses which promote balance and strength.  I love relaxing into the 'corpse' pose at the end---feels so good, mentally and physically.
I would not recommend this tape for anyone who does not regularly exercise.  This is not yoga for the faint of heart.  It is strenuous and I guarantee you will sweat more than you ever imagined.  For beginners, I would recommend something a little slower---maybe Jennifer Kries Method Yoga---  which goes through the actual poses with more detail and breaks the programs up into 3 separate workouts instead of the 50 minutes spent on a tape like Kests.  Once the poses are learned with a degree of accuracy, I think it would be appropriate to move into Kest's faster flowing repetitions.
For anyone who does exercise regularly and wants to try something a little different--this series is great!",1035331200,6,1967,4.850299401197605

I have never worked so hard at yoga in my life, until I practiced with this set of tapes. Bryan is an excellent teacher who really knows his stuff. At first, when I was reviewing the tapes I was a bit ovewhelmed about doing the poses. To my suprise, I'm more flexible than I thought I would be. With his motivational techniques and encouraging wisdom, Bryan really brings out the best in one's yoga performance. What's so fun about this set of tapes is that you'll always be challenged and you'll see results almost immediately. I would recommend for any serious yoga buff to buy this set.

682828,5,6303548970,"Bryan is the best! I purchased Kathy Smith's yoga tape but found something lacking; I felt the focus was on look at me. And in order to follow Denise Austin's routine, one has to be on speed. Suzanne Deason's tapes are great for beginners, but lacked the intensity that I needed. Patricia Walden's series are okay, more look at what I can do.
What impressed me about Bryan is his emphasis on spirituality and its application to everyday life.
I'm 53 years old, 5'8"" and 125 pounds. I started Bryan's routine 7 months ago and have noticed significant changes in my body. While I have always been active, Bryan's tapes have helped me cope with the stress in my life - divorce, moving, building a new home. I work out with Bryan six days a week. Even my friend, a physican's assistant who was a personal trainer, is impressed with Bryan's workouts.
I love his down-to-earth attitude and encouraging ways. God Bless Bryan.",1024099200,28,918,4.638036809815951
682829,2,6303548970,"The stretching and poses are excellent but  I thought the words ""power yoga"" ""sweat"" and ""strength"" were rather misleading. If you are already fairly fit, these videos probably aren't going to make you break a sweat or gain strength. The only strength-related pose involved one pushup every few minutes. For beginners, this would be challenging, (the instructor says ""don't worry if you can't do a full pushup!"") but for people who are already fit it's pretty tame.  The poses do provide a great stretch though.

The people shown taking the class appear very advanced and are in no way beginners.  In addition, I found Kest's constant jabbering extremely annoying and this made it difficult to get into the right frame of mind. I much prefer Yoga Zone and Rodney Yee's tapes to these and think they are much better suited for beginners.  I did not enjoy this tape.",1013472000,6,567,4.280373831775701

7849814,5,6303548970,"Hello everyone!

Simply the best program still for someone who is just starting his or her Yoga practice. Bryan is one of the best yoga teachers in the west, most polite and greatly motivating speaker during the workouts I have come across. To me he is Tony Horton version for Yoga.

This series has three videos and all of them are very easy to do. The third one is challenging and may take you two or three months to master with daily practice. I honestly found this still way better than a thousand DVDs and videos I have watched over the years for my Yoga. Yoga is evolving but the start up basics remain the same and hence this video is still one of the best out there.

For those who find that this is not for beginners I would say then what is? You have to start at some point and having lived in India for years I know for a fact that no pose in Yoga can be perfect on day one or even after a year. Bryan particularly stresses at multiple critical points during the video to instruct the viewers to do as much as your body allows you to do at start. One of his most famous quotes is "" It is not about about how it looks like, it is about how it feels like"". Once you or your body is feeling some from of stretch, you are doing just fine. The idea is to slowly make your body more flexible as it was when we were children. Do not worry about how you are doing the poses at start as that simply just does not matter in Yoga. One can have his feel as wide as needed to be comfortable as long as one can maintain the balance and copy the pose as much as possible. Over time keep correcting you pose with every time you practice and sooner than you would imagine you would have the balance, flexibility and strength needed for a picture perfect pose. I hope this makes sense as I could not emphasize this enough.

Please do note as these are from quite some time in the past they are not in HD but I have had no issues of any kind with the scaling of them on my HD/4k TV. Very clear videos still and great background music as it is supposed to be.

Very highly recommended. Will change your life and health forever.

Best!",1522800000,,2125,4.096153846153846

They are challenging, but not too much (plus, I'm at home so I can drop into child's pose whenever I need to and no one will know.  LOL).  There is something about the way he verbal sets up each pose and movement that has helped me get into pretzely positions I usually can't do.
