8327535,5,B001NOL09C,".I've studied Northern Praying Mantis via the Chiu (Chi and many people call it) Style from Sifu John Chiu; at that time, now Master Ortiz was himself as Sifu. I found that his DVDs, offered a very good instructional substitute when I found myself working numerous hours. Master Ortiz's DVDs were once under the Panther label, now they are rare and hard to find. Even if you contact him directly he might not contact you back ""trust me on that one""  He is a good practitioner much like Master Jon Funk in Canada. Modern day tapes-videos on the internet offer techniques that look good, however they aren't true to the system (poor hybrids) and even poorer to the Praying Mantis spirit of the art. Thank MMA for that, as everyone wants short cuts and to make their mark young and very early, risking health, life and livelihood. I needed to replace the VHS and DVDs I lost and/or had wear. i.e. no. 2 and 9. So guy see blood like sharks and think everyone will purchase an old DVD or VHS for $200-$300 dollars. Sadly, I'm not Mr. Trump and I'm not a lollypop; so if you are reading this, get real or keep your DVD/VHS",1382054400,,1116,4.41747572815534
