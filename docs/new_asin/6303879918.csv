7855395,4,6303879918,"This movie had a twist, it leaves you wondering who done it for a while but it has a happy ending.",1377475200,,98,3.7142857142857144
7855396,3,6303879918,"This film is a whodunit, soft-porn, whatever. David (Scott Bakula) and Jerry (John Getz) are best friends since school. They have always been competative. They share a long-time friendship with Beth (Sheila Kelley), who dated them both when they were in school. Now, all of them are just plain old ordinary friends. Then enters Diana (Chelsea Field) who married Jerry on a singles-cruise, without David's or Beth's knowing. Diana is one mixed-up piece of work. Jerry asks David to ""talk"" to Diana (David is a psychiatrist), get to the source of her erratic behaviour. David is hesitant, and seeks the advice of a fellow psychiatrist, Louise (France Nuyen); who advises David that he is playing a dangerous game with his ""help"" with Diana. But...he falls head-over-heels (and other body parts) in love with Diana (someone else they share, without Jerry's knowing). Jerry received some very interesting informaton about Diana from someone from her past. He is not amused. Next thing you know, Jerry is murdered. David should have taken heed of his friend's advice. Diana is a prime suspect. But suspicion also falls on Beth, who is still in love with David, hoping that they would someday get back together again. David suspected Beth because be believes her to be obsessive with him, thinking that she is jealous of Diana; as well as a rather a damning clue he discovers. He is aware that Diana is quite capable of killing, and wishes otherwise. The storyline is okay, but I found the sex-scenes a bit gratuitous. I like Jerry, Beth, and Louise the best; as well as the two policemen, friends of Beth.",1078704000,,1600,4.886029411764706
7855397,5,6303879918,"After watching all those episodes of ""Quantum Leap"" where Scott Bakula always (well almost) knew what he was doing, being almost perfectly-good oriented character, it's really peculiar and interesting to  watch him playing this role. Unsure what to do, and how to act, his mind  confuzes as he must choose between 'love' and lunacy. Chelsea Field is just  great actress to show us the role of dark twisted mind or split personality  that lights only as a counterattack. Erotic thriller which is hard to find  this good. If you like the genre, then it's for you.",963619200,,561,4.802083333333333
7855398,5,6303879918,"I recomend this film to any fan of either Scott Bakula, or his co-starring wife, Chelsea Field. The tension of the story builds as psychologist David Lawson (Scott Bakula), is lured in by his best friend's new wife, Diana (Chelsea Field). He doesn't want to hurt his friend, but he also can't  resist her. As is conveyed by the title, there are some passionate scenes  with Scott and Diana, and some tense moments. A Must-See!",955238400,,426,4.666666666666667
7855399,5,6303879918,"Scott Bakula(American Beauty) plays a shrink who falls in lovewith a friends wife. Bakula and the wife eventually fall inlove. There are losts od plot twists as turns as Bakula looks into his friend husbands death.
If you like this movie check out ""Color of Night""(Bakula co-stars in that movie with Bruce Willis)but it similair to this movie! Please A-Pix or whoever owns this movie bring it back on video and DVD sometime in the near future! It's worth a rental ,but if you can buy this suspenseful erotic thriller!",955152000,,517,4.7555555555555555
7855400,5,6303879918,"Scott Bakula plays a psychiatrist whose friend is murdered by his wife whom he happens to fall in love with.  The plot twists and turns around Bakula's character David and several others who go at each other's throats.  Many people are blamed for this murdering streak and it comes back to bite  David in the end.  It's an excellent movie and ends a little different than  I expected it to.  But, I still enjoyed it emensely.",943142400,,425,4.526315789473684
