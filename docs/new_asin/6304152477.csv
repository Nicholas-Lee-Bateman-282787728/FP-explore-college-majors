7862934,4,6304152477,"In 1992, producer and director David DuBos filmed Rodrigue:  A Man and His Dog with Whoopi Goldberg for Louisiana Public Broadcasting.  Although the storyline has little connection to Georges recent paintings, at the time it followed his imagery, tracing his deceased dog Tiffany as she searched for his studio in the afterlife. [A photo of Tiffany was the model for many of the Blue Dog paintings.]

The movie includes Rodrigues Cajun and Blue Dog paintings, as well as early footage from his studio and home in Lafayette, Louisiana.  Whoopi Goldberg did the voice of the black-and-white Tiffany, the Blue Dog, and the Red Dog.

You can find the movie online at YouTube in 3 parts. It has not been released on DVD.",1399680000,,715,4.827868852459017
