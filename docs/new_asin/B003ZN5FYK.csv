8410691,1,B003ZN5FYK,"After seeing this guy on TV I thought, this is the DVD for me.  Fun, energetic, creative, great dance moves, etc.  Well guess what?  His first video is only one routine.  He goes over the steps slowly, which is fine, but at the end, you are supposed to do the whole routine.  The problem is, he plays his music video instead of dancing with you so if you don't remember the moves, you're lost.  That portion of the video is simply self promotion for a singing career that will never be!  The second video is extremely boring and the moves are too simple.  It is A LOT of marching in place.  I can do that myself for free!  Both videos are poorly edited (a lot of cutting and pasting because he screws up so much), he makes a lot of mistakes, he rambles, and they are nothing like you see on TV.  It is like he turned on a video camera and made up the DVDs as he went.  Poorly done on all counts.",1303516800,19,895,4.080459770114943
