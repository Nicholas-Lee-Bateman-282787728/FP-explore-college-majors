8173013,5,B000MV8AS6,Great DVD for getting to jam Chicago Blues. On screen tab is really all you need and the examples will get able to play the songs on stage or at you local Blues Jam.,1453507200,,165,3.8823529411764706
8173014,5,B000MV8AS6,Just got started and so far I'm enjoying it.  My novice skills are improving with each practice.  I do wish there was a play alone option.,1414195200,,138,4.269230769230769
8173015,4,B000MV8AS6,The DVD does a good job of teaching the songs. Eight classic Chicago Blues songs are covered with the tablature for the song presented on the screen. Some players might prefer to have a printed version but the songs are easy enough to learn and are presented clear enough so not having a printed copy should not be a hindrance to learning the material.,1376697600,2,352,4.515625
8173016,3,B000MV8AS6,Should have come with downloadable and printable sheet music for practice.  Nice video and sound showing different camera angles. It's okay,1366156800,3,139,5.619047619047619

  Volume 4 includes:
  ""All Your Love (I Miss Loving)"" (Otis Rush)
  ""Easy Baby"" (Magic Sam)
  ""I Ain't Got You"" (Jimmy Reed)
  ""I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man"" (Muddy Waters)
  ""Killing Floor"" (Howlin' Wolf)
  ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" (Buddy Guy)
  ""Messin' with the Kid"" (Junior Wells)
  ""Sweet Home Chicago"" (various)
I gave this 4 stars because I don't own this one but have a similar one : I just hate it when the song list is not included in these listings. So I looked it up and provided it here. It would seem to me to be a good value for the beginner/ intermediate player just for "" Killing Floor"" and ""Sweet Home Chicago"" alone. If it's like the other Hal Leonard titles like this one ; it is well done and they provide a quality instructor. These are good foundational gateway lessons to learning heavier blues rock versions of these songs. Amazon usually has the best price on these titles.
I'm a visual learner and don't usually have the patience for tablature so I have many of these. The ultimate would be a dvd/cd rom that breaks down guitar parts into passages (both rhythm and lead allowing you to slow down and repeat a passage (with the tab on the page), as many times as you need to. Then offer you advanced tips and techniques and advanced lessons. The T-Bone Walker version of ""Stormy Monday"" is nothing like the Allman Brothers version. Ideally a lesson would teach you both versions. Then a backing track should be included for both versions. It would also be good if you could pick the songs you want on the lesson. So, until someone invents and app for all that ; this is a good place to start.",1343001600,6,1629,4.479591836734694
