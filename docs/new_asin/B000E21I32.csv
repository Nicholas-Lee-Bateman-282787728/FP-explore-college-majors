8455204,4,B000E21I32,"My review of this video might be slanted a bit. I first saw this video as a child. Re-watching it as an adult, I sum it up as an ""Entertaining Sports History lesson"". Most North American sports are covered( No golf or auto racing). It made an impression on me as a kid. I loved the highlight montages at the start of every chapter. Combine this with a nice soundtrack, and sound bites from some of the people who where there (Including a young Chris Webber talking about the NCAA tournament time out incident) and you have a fairly nice presentation.
  I've seen a few of the other ""Year in sports"" videos and they don't seem to have the same magic in them as this one. Nice childhood memory.",1431043200,,692,4.3565891472868215
8455205,5,B000E21I32,This is really personal more than anything for me. This was a video that my little brother and I watched over and over growing up. I really appreciate that you had it.,1390003200,,167,4.25
8455206,2,B000E21I32,"""Sports Illustrated: 1993 The Year in Sports"" is a 45 minute encapsulation of athletic highlights from that year. For sports lovers this could be an exciting reminiscence but more casual fans will probably not be interested. The presentation is heavy on football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and boxing, though a few other very brief clips manage to sneak in too. The video promotes ""Sports Illustrated"" heavily, to the point you will likely want to fast forward through the exceptionally long introduction. Also feel free to skip the preview ad for ""The New Dodge,"" which highlights the truly homely then-new Dodge Caravan.

The material varies in quality dramatically, and the introductory segments and supporting music are trying. There are numerous short interviews, some of which are quite enlightening, while others are padding. I enjoyed the segments with Charles Barkley (1993 NBA MVP) in his Phoenix Suns glory days the most, and thought the coverage of the Suns versus Bulls series was well done, especially the coverage of game three which went four quarters and three overtime periods before Barkley and company finally won. The big story of that series was the rivalry of Barkley and Michael Jordan, and while the Bulls won the series, here both players come off as respectful but confident rivals.

Also gratifying was Alabama's Sugar Bowl victory over Miami; it's always encouraging to see a distinct underdog best a favorite but cocky team. In my favorite blunder of the year, I was enthralled by the excessive overtime taken by the Miami Hurricanes resulting in a novel play: I don't want to spoil the moment for you, but believe me that the resultant play (and color commentary) is one of the most entertaining moments in the history of the game. Racing is largely ignored, though Rusty Wallace's spectacular dual crackups are shown. In the conclusion the champions of the year are listed in a variety of sports including collegiate and women's leagues.

If you have a fanatical affinity for sports or events from 1993 in particular, this is probably about the best short synopsis available, but if you are less of a diehard sports historian the cheesy production values and uneven and superficial coverage will likely be a disappointment.",1335484800,,2259,5.1
