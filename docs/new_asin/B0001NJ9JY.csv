8015223,4,B0001NJ9JY,"I would advise people to stay away from this DVD Unless they really know their subject well, The quality of this DVD is okay just good enough for viewing only.  Small Circle Jujitsu Intermediate has no instructional sound value what so ever.  There is no sound to explain what Professor Wally Jay is demonstrating to us.  Some things I could figure out, but the majority of what he showing is left up to the person viewing his DVD to figure out on there own.  I still really love this DVD.  Professor Wally Jays is awesome.  I just like to watch it from time to time.  Just be ware this DVD has no sound, or at least the one I purchased didn't.  I'm disappointed  about the sound, but glad to be watching a cool person show us his craft one of the greats do his thang.",1361750400,,768,4.241379310344827
8015224,4,B0001NJ9JY,"Wally Jay was held up by Bruce Lee as one of the best in his craft, JuJitsu.  The film is very simple and cheap even in its presentation, no fancy camera work or props here.  All is done in a gym with some willing victims.  The technique is clear though too often too fast to really catch clearly.  Some slo-mo work would have been nice.",1350086400,,337,4.138461538461539
8015225,3,B0001NJ9JY,"I thought this video would be alittle more instructional. It seemed mostly comprised of one guy repeatedly subduing a couple other younger guys with no direction how to reenact this in normal sparring. If given the option, I would try another DVD.",1284163200,5,247,4.904761904761905
