5613545,2,B00BF7FGNI,"It's too easy to take a production like Foodfight! and lob snarky comments at it. Well okay, just one. The characters in this film over-move, like Ed Grimley on that Saturday Night Live sketch when he found out he was going to meet Pat Sajak.

But snark is too easy. Figuring out how it happened is almost unfathomable. Let's start with the premise, which is something like those Warner cartoons in which a grocery store came to life after hours and the products sang and danced on the shelves.

In this case, the aisles become like multi-national city streets. The lead character (voiced by Charlie Sheen either within a very short one-take recording session or deliberately to sound cool and detached) is a cross between Indiana Jones and McGruff the Crime Dog.

All of the primary characters are fictional product icons, while a procession of actual food and grocery item characters, including Mister Clean, Charlie the Tuna and Mrs. Butterworth make cameos. Endless images of real logos and packages make appearances throughout. Perhaps the idea was to have the product placement cover the budget.

But the budget and the whole production were apparently a total bust. The film was eventually put up for auction and got a limited release overseas, even though it was finished seven years ago.

Much of it doesn't even look finished -- characters and objects shake, overlap and often don't look anchored in their settings. The characters don't seem in scale with each other, nor from scene to scene.

The creepy villains look grotesque, but so do some of the ""nice"" characters -- like the evil Mister X and the grocery store manager. Even the copyrighted characters are mere shadows of their former selves as we saw them in commercials. All seem made of PVC and have eyes like marbles.

There are moments in which one might glimpse at what could have been. The premise is kind of clever and there are some amusing moments, like an army of ketchup tanks, along with some spectacular graphics of the cityscape. The concrete objects far exceed the ""living ones"" in design and execution.

But the script is splattered with lines like ""What the fudge!"" ""You cold-farted itch!"" and famous tag lines that might have worked if used more judiciously. And you can look forward to flatulence and a long-playing belch.

I don't like to dump on movie misfires when they're often the product of hard work by good people. And some of these films are fascinating, even likable, despite how the don't, or didn't, work. Often there's more to learn from misses than from hits.

The credits for Foodfight! include some of the best talent in the business. I cannot imagine everyone who was brought into this project had any idea what might have been going on behind the scenes, nor how the ""final"" film would turn out.",1368748800,19,2800,4.814583333333333

5613587,5,B00BF7FGNI,"Reader be warned, for I have given this movie a five star rating in the manner of only someone who appreciates the sheer horror of true atrocities can. Have you ever heard of a movie that is so bad it is considered good? This is not one of those movies. While the fact that this movie even made it out to the shelves (after the turmoil involved in its production) is impressive, it is a true cinematic tragedy. It is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I firmly stand by that statement. I am proud to say that I've watched it the whole thing, mostly as a personal dare after watching a YouTube review about it by JonTron. And even though I may never recover from this movie's assault on my visual and auditory senses, I hail this abomination as the shining king of all horrible movies, much like the demons of hell praise Satan. Half way through the movie, I felt myself slipping into a state of helpless confusion and insanity. All hope was gone, and all I could do was laugh with the abandon of someone who knows they're in a situation that promises nothing but death. Thus resulting in this depraved sense of humor that has compelled me to rate this movie with five stars, possibly to draw an unsuspecting fly to the Venus plant.

A serious note: even though it was intended as a children's movie, I do not recommend that children watch it. The images, in all honesty, may actually be frightening, and the humor is riddled with sexual innuendoes. If this movie is so terrible, you must be wondering why I bought it. I bought it as a gag gift for my roommate, who shares my twisted admiration of it. I encourage you to research its history, which explains why such an awful thing can even exist. I'll entice you to do so by starting with the fun tidbit that this movie cost $65 million to make. To put that into perspective, the first Toy Story cost about half that.

It's the bread and butter of animated movies, because they must elicit emotion from usnot likely when these stiff animated motion capture characters are plodding around, spouting witticisms that are more often meant for adults, with the occasional sexual innuendo and the frequent nods to Casablanca.

5613598,1,B00BF7FGNI,"Ever since the rise of Youtube and Internet reviewing, there have been a certain small collection of bad movies that have mesmerized the public. ""The Room,"" ""Birdemic,"" ""Fateful Findings,"" and so on.

And for the kids.... there's ""Foodfight!""

It is difficult to even describe all the ways ""Foodfight!"" fails, both as cinematic art and as entertainment. The animation is dreadful. The world-building is baffling. The characters are insultingly shallow. Ethnic stereotypes abound. The plot is a confusing kiddie version of ""Casablanca.""  Since the movie is for kids, most of the humor revolves around sex and excrement. And of course, the vital moral message is ""buying generic-brand products is like supporting cannibalistic Nazis.""

The story takes place in a supermarket that comes to life every night, transforming into a city filled with ""ikes"" that represent the various products in the store. Dex Dogtective (Charlie ""Tiger Blood"" Sheen), a cereal mascot, is preparing to propose to his girlfriend Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff)... but then she vanishes without a trace. Despairing, he gives up being a Dogtective and... opens a nightclub. No, I don't understand why.

But six months later, he's approached by the supposedly sexy Lady X (Eva Longoria), the seductive ike of the new Brand X. But when a riot leads to the sudden horrible deaths of many ikes, Dex reluctantly decides to get involved again -- and very predictably discovers that Lady X (being a sexualized woman) is evil, scheming to exterminate all ikes and take over the store. Can Dex and his chocolate squirrel friend Dan (Wayne Brady) gather the remaining ikes and stop Brand X for good? Will anyone in the audience care? Spoilers for the latter: the answer is no.

So-bad-they're-good movies are actually quite rare, because they need to be bad consistently, on multiple levels, and exhibit both complete confidence and a total lack of creative talent. So it's not surprising that a movie like ""Foodfight!"" is one of that rare breed. It's pretty obvious that director/producer/writer Lawrence Kasanoff wanted to make a movie like ""Toy Story,"" but failed to realize that it was the good writing and mature storytelling that made people love that film.

And so, unsurprisingly, the movie is an incoherent maelstrom of fart jokes, excrement jokes, disgusting or disturbing sexual innuendo (Cheezel T. Weasel apparently moonlights as a pimp who sells sex dolls), wrapped around a painfully predictable plot with few twists. Literally the entire story becomes evident within the first fifteen minutes, except for the painfully shoehorned-in ""Casablanca"" references -- such as when the French national anthem starts playing in defiance of Brand X's stormtroopers. Very little makes sense.

And the final indignity? The essential message of the movie is that nobody should buy generic-brand products, which are typically not that different from the name-brand ones. But according to Kasanoff, they are filled with addictive, toxic substances and are morally comparable to the Nazis, and thus everyone should only buy from food corporations, which are good and noble and have nothing bad in them.

And did I mention the constant filth and sexual innuendo? Because it can't be overstated. For instance, one scene has an offensive Jewish stereotype spray Dex with mucus, while another has a character literally being flung into a sewer brimming with liquid poo. And when Dan isn't making not-so-veiled sexual remarks about women (""How about some chocolate frosting?"") or being unwillingly pursued by a gay vampire, Lieutenant X is making gleefully rapey and fetishistic comments (""I love a good violation"").

As for the animation, it is nothing short of torture. Due to the theft of the early footage partway through production, Kasanoff decided to reshoot the film with motion capture actors who never seem to know what they're doing. The characters sort of spasm and float through every scene, with no facial expression and cold dead eyes. In fact, the animation is so pitiful that Sunshine appears to have gone blind in some scenes, since she just stares vacantly at the ceiling during a supposedly heartfelt scene.

As for the characters, don't expect actual iconic figures to do more than have a line here or there. The real attention is given up to characters concocted in a crack lab, each as flat as a sheet of paper -- and frankly, most are pretty unlikeable (a vapid damsel, a, an oversexualized villain) -- and mostly without any kind of character development (such as an inept, childish penguin who is apparently supposed to be endearing).

It's hard to think of a worse movie for kids, or a worse animated movie -- ""Foodfight!"" manages to be crass, gross, inept and incompetent. Worse children's movies may exist, but probably none with more consistently terrible content.",1482796800,8,4851,5.173469387755102

5613612,1,B00BF7FGNI,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a true masterpiece in animation film. Let's first discuss the animation itself...if you think Pixar is the king of computer animation...you are so wrong. The people behind Foodfight have completely embarrassed Pixar...Movies like Toy Story 3 and Ratatouille look like amateur hour compared to the complex detail and authentic believable movement and look of the characters and living breathing environments in Foodfight. The facial expressions are so lifelike it makes you wonder if it's even animated...that is how crystal perfect it is.

The story is beyond exceptional. Some may consider it similar to Toy Story in the way the food comes to life after the grocery store closes it's doors and while it is a familiar concept the execution is far superior in Foodfight. They are fighting for their lives against a terrible new threat which is trying to take over the whole store with their own bland products.

Also the food puns are out of this world and will have you laughing nonstop throughout the whole movie.

HOWEVER. after watching it a couple of times, (as you can't believe it is that bad), I've found the hidden gems within the film. The one liners throughout are priceless, and even though it is terribly animated, the story is quite heartwarming.

It's the story of the brands that people grew up with, long established brands, defending themselves against a newer and entirely synthetic brand that's taking over. It's a war story, a Nazi story, a love story, and a comedy, all in one. I found myself shouting ""Dare the Day"" after watching this. My daughter has fallen in love with this movie too.

I think that the CIA can use this film to use as an implement of torture on captured terrorists and it will be far more effective than water boarding in extracting information.  Force a bratty child to behave otherwise you'll force them to watch Food Fight. I guarantee they will behave immediately least they see this sheer torture on film.

5613721,1,B00BF7FGNI,"Of course I've heard about this movie and have even seen a couple YouTube reviews about how terrible it is, so when I saw that it was available for free on Amazon Prime I had to at least check it out.  After watching this movie I have to admit: the naysayers aren't exaggerating.

  The CG animation is like something from a poorly made PBS kids show to the point that it CAN be funny, but for the wrong reasons.  Some of the character designs are straight-up creepy, especially the humanistic female 'Ike' characters, and don't even get me started on the actual humans--terrifying .  Additionally the way some of the characters move is so jerky and spastic (especially 'Daredevil Dan') that you'd swear they have physiological issues.

  The ""humor"" in this movie just isn't funny.  Even worse, the way they tried to work adult humor in is just plain awkward and uncomfortable.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was a movie intended for children.  The constant barrage of product/food-based puns spouted out were groan worthy at best and embarrassing at worst.  When an actual joke was attempted they fell flat.  I can't say that I laughed or chuckled once.

  The plot is so convoluted and contrived that I didn't know what was happening most of the time.  Granted, I understood the ostensible story, but the various scenes between the three acts almost seemed like a series of unrelated short stories.  There are even a few scenes where some 'Ike' characters are executed.  While the execution are not actually seen on screen, they are directly referred to and not just implied.  Again, this is a movie intended for children.

  One of the most baffling things about this movie is that there are enough talented performers to at least make somebody consider seeing it, (Charlie Sheen, Christopher Lloyd, Wayne Brady, Larry Miller, Tim Curry, etc.) but they almost bring none of their talent to their performances.  Granted; there wasn't much for them to work with anyway, but they all seem so uncommitted.  Not that I blame them with a garbage-product like this, but why would any of them have agreed to do this movie in the first place?

  All in all, this is worth seeing just to appreciate how bad it is.  Not in an ironically good way like ""The Room"" or the 2006 version of ""The Wicker Man"", but in a 'this is exactly how not to make a movie' way.  If you have 87 minutes of your life that you don't mind wasting, check it out.  Otherwise, steer clear of this abomination.",1458086400,10,2487,4.658986175115207
5613722,5,B00BF7FGNI,"Before I watched this movie, I was numb and depraved of any joy. The world that I live in had faded to grey. Nothing mattered. For, I was alone and cold, walking on a path of loneliness. But then, as I was walking home from the drab prison known as school, I saw something on the cracked sidewalk which caught my attention: a disk. It was silver and shone brightly on this hazy, dull summer evening. I picked it up, reading the label. FoodFight was the title. I walked home, put it in my DVD player, and began to view it. I might as well watch it. I had nothing better to do.

The first thing I noticed about Foodfight was the beautiful and life-like animation. It looked as if the movie had been animated by angels. The characters moved with smooth, realistic movements. The backgrounds made it look like it took place in Heaven. And, the facial expressions of the characters were very believable. To sum it all up, everything looked unbelievably perfect.

The characters were all unbelievably magnificent. Each one was beautiful and quirky in their own astoundingly brilliant way. Their personalities were unique, and their character designs were better than perfection. I took note of the voice acting, as well. I realized the characters must have been voiced by angels.

The plot of the movie was what stole my heart the most. Everything about it was brilliant. I cried so much, in the first viewing, that I could never cry again. My room was so flooded with tears that I had to use five thousand Mr. Clean magic erasers, just to soak up the water.

In conclusion, this movie--this brilliantly awe-inspiring move--blew me away. Seriously, I am at loss for words. I can't speak, can't think straight, heck; I can barely even breathe. There is nothing I would rather be doing than watch this movie over and over again for all eternity. Currently, I am in my room right now, watching FoodFight on television for the twentieth time today, while stuffing my face with raisins. I am reviewing the film as I watch it. For, it deserves ten stars. No! I take that back! It deserves way more stars than ten! If only I could give it more than that. It deserves more than that.

Before I watched Foodfight, I was a frightened young boy on the brink of insanity. But now, I am a strong, confident man.

Thank you, Foodfight",1457913600,10,2314,4.5772946859903385

I would say they spent at least half the budget on Charlie Sheen's salary, then on Eva Longoria, Wayne Brady, Hillary and Haylie Duff, Christopher Lloyd, Ed Asner, Tim Curry, and Chris Kattan for their salaries, 1,000 to rent the green-screen and left about 500 for the animator. Thats the best explanation I have for such a mediocre film with cast you can actually recognize. Whatever they were paid wasn't enough and it definitely hurt their careers. The animation sets a whole new low and the worst thing Disney has made doesn't even come close to reaching these depths. Only watch if you are the kind of person who can watch and enjoy bad films. Don't subject kids to this, not only because of its mediocre quality but it has too many foul jokes and gags, some may go over their heads, some may be blatant and obvious enough.

5613749,1,B00BF7FGNI,"The music/soundtrack is the only bright spot in this stinker, although the mixing and volume levels are not always right.
The animation is like one of those late 90's computer SIM games. Most video games made in the last 15 years are more realistic and lifelike that this cheap software's generator.
The story is ridiculous and the main characters are forgettable. The references to Nazi Germany and corporate mind control are blatant.
The only characters they got right were the California raisins (which were done in the late 80's).
A test of a good movie is, it's over too soon. With a bad movie, you're looking at the clock hoping it's over soon. After 30 minutes, I was fast forwarding through it and it was still too long.
The funniest part is the poor animation, but you can only laugh a minute or two, then it's just sad. The jokes are bad, so bad I groaned most of the time. I can see why funding was so hard to get...nobody was stupid enough to get behind this embarrassing dumpster fire.",1451606400,2,998,4.55
5613750,4,B00BF7FGNI,"This movie was brought to my attention as a high-budget animated feature that was absolute crap.

In watching the first 30 minutes I thought the reason it was so despised was that the jokes were weak, the animation not up to Pixar level, and Charlie Sheen is the lead character voice. I thought it would work for small children like Barney the Dinosaur.

Then I started getting into the story and realized that despite a European/experimental feel to the animation, the story was making an anti-corporate fascist / anti-Neocon / socially libertarian point, and that like any out of the box political movie was being trolled because of its radical perspective of the ""market"" versus the statist ""Brand X.""

Charlie Sheen heads up the voice actors in this movie because it's independent leftist just like he is. Precisely, it's left libertarian.

This movie isn't without its flaws but it's the subject of a smear campaign and for no other reason needs to be rescued from obscurity.

5613757,1,B00BF7FGNI,"This movie is, unfortunately, pretty garbage. In the simplest terms I can manage, the animation is always terrible and frequently off-putting (so many dead eyes), none of the characters are interesting or visually appealing, only one or two voices performances don't sound entirely bored or irritated, the humor lands once or twice at most (that's me being generous) for a mere chuckle and can get strangely/awkwardly sexual and uncomfortable like the movie was written entirely for kids in some scenes and entirely for adults in other scenes, and the licensed mascots that appear are worked into the film in the absolute strangest, lackluster ways possible. The best example I can give is during a scene where they ""set up"" a joke about being bald and Mr. Clean suddenly, silently appears (he never has any lines during the film) to be part of the punchline, but once the joke is finished, he just stands in the background while the scene continues with all of the important characters talking to each other, but Mr. Clean is still noticeable because of how he stands out from everything around him. I know the original version of this movie was mysteriously stolen, forcing the production team to essentially remake the entire movie from scratch, which is a situation I do not envy and wish didn't happen since hard work does go into these movies no matter how terrible they turn out to be and that movie was almost assuredly better (at least better-looking) than this one, but when I think of the phrase ""Quit while you're behind"", I now think of ""Foodfight"".

5613758,3,B00BF7FGNI,"I would never buy this film for a child, or loved one, due to how stupid it is. However, I had bought this for myself because of all the negative feedback it had received on the internet. I had heard soooooo many reviews on this film, and how horrible it was, so I bought it, and yes, it is really bad. The animation is lifeless, and weird. Watch the movie, and you will notice that there is very little facial/ eye expressions when the characters are talking. Instead, the characters respond/react with weird jerking motions, and other bizarre body gestures/movements. For example, in one seen the dog detective is having a show down, and during his tough guy speech, he twirls around, and then points his fingers at the bad guys.

The dialogue is nothing but one liner jokes, and yukkkeeeee! There is adult dialogue in this film, that is suppose to go over a child's head, but adults are suppose to get it. I liked this movie in the sense that I WATCHED it only because how bad it was suppose to be, and on that level, this movie did not disappoint me.
Will I watch this movie again? The answer is yes. It is one of those films that is so awful in its appearance, music, jokes, movements, and so on that you can't help but watch it in amazement. The whole time of watching this you will say ""why"" and ""what"". It is fun to watch this and try to figure out who ever thought this was a good idea.
However, the verrrrryyyyyyyy basic story line, is one that could have been salvaged, and in fact, made successful, if Disney or Pixar had create it. But for how it was made, it is an awful film.
SIDE NOTE:
Please do not buy this if you think it will shock you, or you think it will offend you (for it's adult jokes), because if you do you will be disappointed. Buy this with the expectations that you will be watching terrible animation, bizarre dialogue, and go no where moments that can be verrrryyyyy boring.

The story basically follows the lives of product mascots that live in a supermarket during a time of upheaval.  The cool thing is that in addition to the made up mascots for the movie.

- Plot is revealed ham-handedly but otherwise hard to follow, without internal consistency but with a creepy corporate-icons-against-Brand-X moral. This is especially true when recognizable brand characters (Mr Clean) show up.
- Characters are occasionally well-designed, but most range between ""bizarre"" and ""unsettling"". Several are uncomfortable stereotypes.
- Animation is manic, with many obviously-repeated animations (especially in the crowds). Some establishing shots are obviously the exact same frames shown before.
- CGI is odd, with misplaced shiny reflections and poor pixelated textures. Lighting is poor, and shapes frequently ""clip"" into one another, especially hair. It feels like Second Life or a bad 90s-era video game than anything released this decade.
- Voice actors are great on paper but aren't really cohesive. Sound editing in general is poor: Crank it up to hear dialogue and back down as soon as the music starts.

It's almost a ""dare to watch"" affair: every minute you spend peeling back layer upon layer of bad acting, worse animation, terrible scriptwriting, is a minute you'll never have back. Use your minutes in a wiser manner and don't spend them watching this piece of garbage that looks like a corporate-sponsored infomercial/afterschool special from 1996. Just look at the poster and see how they had to accentuate the cast's names. Take note of their attempt to stuff the Vlassic pickle stork, Charlie the Tuna, along with a ripped-off Woody from Toy Story and a dog that sort of looks like Indiana Jones all together in some attempt to rouse your nostalgia and, let's face it, stoke brand recognition.

On the other hand, it's about as bad as The Room and some other legendarily ridiculous movies, so it's kind of worthwhile to watch Charlie Sheen phone it in, Hilary Duff voice the world's most abysmally bad attempt at some kind of anime woman-cat, and Wayne Brady do some kind of Chris Rock impression in the role of Racist Squirrel (I think that's its name).

I swear to god this is like the Troll 2 of computer animation....it must be seen to be believed.

Nothing, literally NOTHING, about this movie works. The voice acting is dull and uninteresting (though Wayne Brady manages to bring his brand of Wayne Brady-ness to it, which does help), the CGI is horrible (actually worse than the experimental shorts like ""Tin Toy"" Pixar created in the 1980s), and the story is beyond cynical and stupid (basically boils down to ""food with cartoon mascots is good, food without mascots is bad"").

Worst of all is that this is marketed as a kid's movie....yet it's got a nasty layer of perverted sexuality painted all over it, from inane innuendos (""I wanna scrub your bubbles."") to bizarre sexual sight gags (Eva Longoria Lady strikes a sexy pose as a squadron of fighters fly past, making it appear as if they are flying out of her vagina), there's even a scene where Charlie Sheen Dog is dancing with Eva Longoria Lady and he GETS AN ERECTION. Totally serious here, he looks down at his pant leg and it just swells up. Camera focuses directly on it.

I've seen better CGI playing Counter Strike Source, and had more fun doing that than paying attention to this thing.

The voice acting is decent enough, but a lousy story, cliche to poor dialogue, and a story pocked with just awful scenes and even worse action sequences, one wonders how this film passed muster in front of all the food company executives who threw their lot into this thing.

Lawrence Kasanoff has two credits to his name as a director.  This movie is one of them.  The other is a publicity video promotion for the old Mortal Combat Video Game.  Ho-boy,

One gets the sense that he sold the food marketers a big fat bill of goods when he talked all the major corporations into adding their icon into what he probably promised was going to be a giant feature film ""commercial"" for everyone's product.

Mister Kasanoff, if you want to defeat bigotry and other negative stereotypes about Hollywood that undulate across this great nation known as the United States of America, then don't screw over the common businessman, and that includes corporate board members.  Especially when you fleece them for a whopping $45mil ($45,000,000) to deliver direct-to-stream quality product.

If I were mister Kasanoff, I would be deeply ashamed.

To all of the food companies who follow FDA guidelines, who actually make it a point of cranking out quality product, and who believe in business, free enterprise, and serving the American public, as a former member of the motion picture industry, I apologize.

Rest assured, if I had helmed this thing, it would have been a much better film.

5613864,1,B00BF7FGNI,"$65 million. This movie cost $65 million to make. Wayne Brady's portrayal of a racial stereotype in squirrel form officially puts him in first place in terms of the ongoing contest for ""World's Whitest Black Man"" (seriously, I'm not exaggerating here: not only does Wayne Brady make Bryant Gumbel look like Malcolm X, this stinker now means he also makes Darius Rucker look like Elijah Muhammad and Cuba Gooding Jr. look like Huey P. Newton). Christopher Lloyd's character looks like he's having a seizure. I think Charlie Sheen is trying to imitate Humphrey Bogart for the sole purpose of destroying Bogey's legacy for some perceived slight. The animation looked royally bad in 2002; now it's simply unbearable to look at. Hilary Duff and Eva Longoria's characters have the personalities of tone-deaf corpses. The scenes between Sheen and Longoria essentially promote bestiality.

Look, I'm all for giving movies for children a pass on terribleness because parents need something to keep their kids occupied for an hour or two, and I have a healthy appreciation for the wonder of bad movies (there's a reason I like to watch the old anti-drug movies from the 30s). But if - after reading all the reviews - you buy this for your child as a sincere gift and a symbol of affection for your offspring, you're either a sadist or a moron. Either way your children should be taken from you. If your kid watches a trailer of this and still wants to see it, you need to prepare for a person who will either a) live at home until (s)he's well past 40, or b) wind up in prison for some heinous crime.

In short, this lives up to the hype as one of the worst films of all time. It makes ""Howard the Duck"" look like ""Casablanca"" in comparison.",1408492800,23,1731,4.65359477124183

5613872,1,B00BF7FGNI,"When I was browsing through the video store, I noticed FOODFIGHT! It listed Charlie Sheen, Hilary Duff, and Eva Longoria as voices and the cover featured such iconic advertising characters as Charlie Tuna and Mrs. Butterworth. Based upon the description of the movie on the back cover, I thought FOODFIGHT! would be kind of like Toy Story, but with advertising icons. Not only that, but additional voices for the movie were provided by Christopher Loyd, Chris Kattan, Wayne Brady, and Harvey Fierstein. Based upon all of this, you would think that FOODFIGHT! would at least be a half-way decent animated movie. Thats what I thought, but boy was I ever wrong. FOODFIGHT! turned out to be the worst animated movie I have ever seen.

Dex Dogtectives (Charlie Sheen) life goes downhill after his girlfriend, Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff) disappears right before he proposes to her. Months later, theres a new group of items in Marketropolis (the supermarket where the story takes place). These items are Brand X and Brand Xs most prominent icon is Lady X (Eva Longoria). Classic icons (called Ikes in the movie) are killed off and expired one-by-one and their products replaces with Brand X merchandise. After his best friend Daredevil Dan (Wayne Brady) disappears, Dex comes out of his slump and starts an investigation that ultimately ends up leading to all out war in the aisles of Marketropolis. Dont be fooled, though. This synopsis is actually better than the movie really is.

The animation in the film is horrendous. There are parts in the movie where the film is clearly unfinished: you can see the white lines of where scenery in the movie was going to be created, but was never inserted. For instance, there are several times where there is a building, but the building isn't completely colored and you can see lines (like in a blueprint) that form the building, but the building is incomplete.

For about a third of the movie, the voices don't directly match up with what the characters are saying: their lips either move to fast or too slow. This part of the film might make for a good drinking game, but everyone participating would be passed out before the movie was even half over.

The dialogue is atrocious and sounds like someone translated the script from a foreign language, but didn't bother to adapt what was said into comprehensible English.

FOODFIGHT! is supposed to be a childrens movie, but theres actually a lot in the film that I would be uncomfortable having a child watch. For instance, there are several jokes made in the movie that are heavy with sexual overtones and euphemisms. FOODFIGHT! gives Shakespeare a run for his money in number of double entendres used in a story. There is some violence, however, its not real violence. Yet, the film is full of imagery stolen straight out of history from Nazi Germany. There are a couple of scenes that are taken directly from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.

Its a wonder FOODFIGHT! ever got made. The movie was actually completed about ten years before it was released on DVD in the U.S., mostly due to legal troubles. After seeing it, one almost wonders why anyone would bother over a movie so bad. There isn't anything in FOODFIGHT! worth fighting about.",1403222400,9,3225,4.833333333333333

5613913,1,B00BF7FGNI,"Great concept, poor execution. Some of the characters had fine motion/animation and others seemed unfinished. The story is a bit hard to follow.",1377734400,,144,5.304347826086956
5613914,5,B00BF7FGNI,"It could be possibly the worst movie made in the last 20 years....animated or otherwise.  It has sexism, nazi overtones, a little bit of racism.  The animation was clearly unfinished,  The story line is laughably offensive.

Most enjoyable 90 minutes I've spent in a long time.  The more scotch I drank, the better it got.  If you appreciate truly bad cinema (and you know who you are), you will add to your collection",1377302400,33,418,4.657534246575342
5613915,4,B00BF7FGNI,I thought the animation appeared unfinished: it could have been done much better. HOWEVER the script was superb! There are hilarious one liners all the way through (like the potato who drank too much was told he'd end up 'chip-faced') and the story line was good.,1376006400,,263,4.739130434782608

8567641,1,B00BF7FGNI,This movies animation is so bad my chihuahua hated it,1524268800,,53,4.4
8567642,1,B00BF7FGNI,"This is one of the worst animated films I have watched in my entire life. The CG animation looked incomplete, the plot is horrible, and there are several perverse contents that are far over the heads of youngsters under 15 years of age. Take my advice, do not buy this for your kids! There are way better CG animated films that are more suitable for children, such as ""Frozen"", ""Sing"", and ""The Emoji Movie"".",1522454400,,408,4.527027027027027
8567643,1,B00BF7FGNI,"Unimaginably, wonderfully wretched.  It's a MUST-HAVE for lovers of bad movies.  Foodfight fits in nicely with the other cinematic abominations in our collection, like Cool Cat Saves the Kids, and The Room.  We gotta hand it to Charlie Sheen for making the best out of his garbagey dialogue, and certainly Wayne Brady, who was tasked with delivering all of his terrible lines with great energy and enthusiasm.  The only real drawback to this CGI disaster is that many of the characters are badly animated to the point of true scariness.  I had to look just to the side of the tv screen whenever Christopher Lloyd's character came jerkily flailing onto the scene.",1522195200,3,662,4.875
8567644,1,B00BF7FGNI,"With all the voice talents involved, you would expect it to be at least watchable. But it was awful. The animation is terrible, the humor is flat, the plot is convoluted. This came up under ""Children and Family"" movies, but a lot of the humor was directed at adults, and it wasn't funny.",1521504000,,287,4.433962264150943
8567645,5,B00BF7FGNI,It wasn't what we were expecting but it beats sausage party.,1518652800,,60,4.545454545454546
8567646,3,B00BF7FGNI,"It's as bad as everyone says.  Still, as long as you know that going in, it can be an amusing watch.  If you've seen any of the funny reviews of this movie, and you're curious, check it out.  You will be disappointed... unless you're expecting to to be disappointed.",1516320000,,266,4.387755102040816
