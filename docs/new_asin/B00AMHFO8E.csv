Gellert (Ken Duken) gets his throat cut for cheating at cards in the first scene and then continues the game as if nothing happened. A woman (Regina Lund) enters the room, one who everyone knows and wants to play poker. If you haven't figured it out by know, you will when he opens the door to a bright light and a zombie looking guy comes in. It is a existential play that goes through the five stages of grief which are given to us in the film a couple of times and on the DVD cover. If that isn't enough to get you all excited and thinking your smart, it includes huge helpings of quotes from Tagore. Gellert has flashbacks in his life, why I don't know, he seemed to be as bored as I was. I didn't care for with any of the characters. I was happy to see them all dead.

It's an art film I didn't care for.
