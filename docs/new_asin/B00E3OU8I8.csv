8600663,5,B00E3OU8I8,"Sissi is a lovely film with beautiful sets, costumes and Music. It is in Italian and no subtitles, but in spite of that it is easy to follow even if you do not speak Italian; if you know anything about the life of the Impress of Austria you can keep up with the plot. Visually the film is a delight with sets and costumes that are so beautiful  you don't need to understand Italian to be intertained.  Even with the sound off this film  would be a joy to watch ; but keep the sound on the music is lush and sweeping.  Lets hope there is a dubded English edition in the future or at least one with subtitles, untill then this film is one not to be missed !!!!",1304640000,9,658,4.038461538461538
