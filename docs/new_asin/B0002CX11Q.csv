I guess Erik Estrada is looking for the blond one and Freddie Boom Washington is looking for juan Epstein and Karen Black wonders why she agreed to all this. Keep 'em comin', Troma!",1493424000,,354,4.461538461538462

8026423,1,B0002CX11Q,"After watching this I had to think that Writer/Actor/Director Jason Holt must believe that bad accents are acting, shouting is dramatic and shouting with a bad accent is dramatic acting. Erik Estrada as a drug king pin tries desperately to be Al Pacino's Tony Montana from Scarface, I kept expecting him to say ""say hello to my little friend"". Karen Black must have been as stoned as her character to act in this movie. I can't really say what the plot was unless it was for Erik to show how ruthless and Karen to show how stoned they could be. Eventually the movie ended so it can't be said I didn't give it a chance",1450224000,,617,4.373913043478261

8026425,2,B0002CX11Q,"Well-l-l-l, Erik E. is incredibly handsome, heavy sigh. What I did watch of the movie was out of focus/grainy.  Lot's of bloodshed, swearing and sex scenes. Karen Black does an awesome job as a woman hooked on crack, then I quit watching. Sorry Erik, B-flick for sure!",1440806400,,268,4.702127659574468
