4717914,5,B005KLOPU0,"I didn't know much about the National Film Registry, but this is more than a mere propaganda piece for the Library of Congress or the Film Registry.  This is a great documentary about American film history and the great need for film preservation.",1331078400,,247,4.744186046511628
4717915,5,B005KLOPU0,"MUST see documentary on the Movies - and the Bonus Features are important too!

In 1988, Congress passed the National Film Preservation Act and with it the National Film Preservation Board, under the auspices of the Librarian of Congress (James Billington). In 1989 the NFPB chose the first group of 25 films for its Registry and, to date 550 films of all types and periods, have been chosen to be preserved in their original form. This includes well-known films like ""The Godfather"", and ""The Wizard of Oz"" to pieces of home movies.

The feature film on this DVD was produced in 2011 and presented at Sundance - as well as an airing on PBS. It is essential viewing by anyone who watches movies. While there is significant discussion of why films deteriorate or why a film is ""culturally important"", this documentary is crafted so it is entertaining as well. Film critics and authors on film are interviewed, but so are celebrities like directors John Waters (hilarious) and  Rob Reiner. The real ""star"" is someone you've never heard of: Library of Congress archivist George Willeman. Looking, and sounding, like a cross between Michael Moore and Roger Ebert, Willeman is the guy in charge of the rare Nitrate film vaults at the modern Packard Campus that the Library of Congress opened in Culpepper, VA about six years ago. He will make you smile and really appreciate film history.

The film has an original score by composer Peter Golub, whose soundtrack could easily stand on its own on a CD.

One of the parts I enjoyed most is the one on censorship, where it shows how recently found footage was able to restore the 1930s film ""Baby Face"" which had been destroyed by heavy censorship editing. And you'll discover new films to seek out and watch. (Keep a pen and pad handy to just titles down as you watch it.)

If you saw this film on PBS, you still need to see this DVD with its bonus features. The 27 minute short ""Lost Forever"" (with more great comments from Willeman) is almost as good as the 88-minute Feature. Next comes a seven-minute featurette on the score with Golub, four alternate or deleted segments (approx nine minutes), and eight minutes of additional interviews with Waters (just great!), director Christopher Nolan and actor Tim Roth. The last ""bonus"" is five minutes of the panel at Sundance. Done with a jerky hand-held camera this is the only extra that disappointed.

This is also a DVD you can watch a second time as you'll discover things you missed the first time.

All the above features are on both the Standard DVD (which I viewed) as well as the BluRay

4717916,5,B005KLOPU0,"Every year, 25 films are added to the National Film Registry to be preserved at the Library of Congress.  This is a fascinating documentary that uses the Film Registry as a springboard to discuss American film culture.  Some very talented filmmakers are included in the discussion - Christopher Nolan, John Lasseter, and Rob Reiner are some notable directors who appear in this film.  The film also includes the thoughts and reflections of various actors, critics, and historians.

Many documentaries, particularly ones that consist mostly of interviews, tend to get tedious and boring.  But the film (88 minutes long) has a brisk pace and moves along quickly (but without feeling too rushed).

One of my favorite aspects of the film is the original score by Peter Golub.  The music really adds to the sense of nostalgia you feel while watching the documentary.  It is available for purchase now, and I highly recommend it.

The blu-ray will include the following bonus material:
- Lost Forever, a look at film preservation, restoration, and more
- Live from Prague: Recording the Score
- These Amazing Shadows at Sundance
- Outtakes
- Alternate and Deleted Scenes",1319155200,15,1164,5.052356020942408
4717927,5,B005KLOPU0,"This wonderful documentary is a must for film lovers.  Created in the late 1980's by Congressional fiat, The National Film Registry was formed to preserve selected films.  In 1986, media mogul Ted Turner purchased the entire catalog of MGM films.  He decided to colorize the films, thinking this ""update"" would create a new audience of younger viewers.  He was met with nearly uniform resistance from stalwarts of the film community, including well-known actors who appealed to Congress to protect such defacement of an American art form.

Managed under the auspices of the Library of Congress, the Registry selects 25 films (or equivalent) each year to be registered.  This documentary by Paul Mariano and Kurt Norton, spends a little time on the creation, but more on individual films.  Films are remembered by current filmmakers and actors and how they were influenced by them.

Perhaps most surprising to me is that certain home movies are included that have historical significance such as the U. S. internment of Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor.  In addition, that little animated bumper everyone who has ever been to a movie has remembers, ""Let's all go to the lobby"" is also registered.  The most interesting discovery is how certain films were needlessly censored, destroying the filmmaker story or intent.  An example is shown of the 1933 film, ""Baby Face"" starring Barbara Stanwyck as a young women intent on success, even if that meant using her ""certain skills"" to get men to see it her way.  Side by side clips of the film are shown which provide cuts required by censors which change the complexion of the film.

Another interesting section of the documentary deals with the storage vaults in Virginia where tens of thousands of film rolls are stored.  Technicians carefully go through films trying to preserve what they can.  We see most of the Registry board in various Q & A segments detailing the process of choosing a film each year.  It would have been fun to sit in on some of the debates.  All in, this is an entertaining and informative documentary and a one movie lovers will want to see.",1433203200,,2119,4.923943661971831

4717955,5,B005KLOPU0,Having studied film history and production as part of my major in college I was thoroughly engrossed in this documentary.  Actually I had seen in on a normal DVD and jumped at the chance to add it to my Blu-ray collection.  It is truly sad to learn that half of all movies made before 1950 are lost forever.  Just think of how the study of the beginnings of the movie would be enhance if more silent films were still available and viewable.  I live in hope that one day 'London After Midnight' is found in some theater basement somewhere in Idaho!  If you love the movies you should love this one.,1356480000,3,597,4.342342342342342
4717956,5,B005KLOPU0,"The films in this documentary are part of the National Film Registry.

The subject of coloring old films is discussed.
This leads to the National film Preservation Act to create the national film registry.
The American film crates a sense of nationhood.

The real problem with this documentary is that it is in less than 5 second sound and picture bytes. They never complete a thought before moving on to the next. There I s no coherence in the train of thought or presentation. The bites have great sounds but no follow-up as to what those bits are trying to say.

It would have been better presented with ether fewer speakers of let one speaker finish before the next begins.

They do slow down for the courtroom speech from ""To Kill a Mockingbird""

8476916,3,B005KLOPU0,"This movie is actually about the founding, rationale and structure of The National Film Registry, which preserves and archives films it deems worthy. I actually enjoyed much of this film and showed it to my Intro to Film students on the first day of class. It was my hope that it would give them a sense of film as an industry, an art form and a way of archiving history. A few of the students seemed bored because it runs about an hour and a half and could benefit by some more editing, but most seemed to enjoy the snippets of ""classic"" films and there was some lively discussion afterwards.",1503964800,,593,4.4

8476918,5,B005KLOPU0,"I recommend this for anyone who enjoys history (me), the art and process of filmmaking (me) or just watching films (me!).  Subjects range the gamut as far as worthy films to preserve and add to the Registry, for future generations to enjoy.  Classics, of course, like ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", to Sci-Fi treasures ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Star Wars"", to cult classics like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Spinal Tap"", etc.  The Registry is diverse and inclusive - even has home movies and commercials.  It also covers film as propaganda, so that future generations see not what was true, but how film was used to manipulate the viewer.....even into doing evil under the guise of virtue.
Includes great sections on women filmmakers, Japanese Internment Camps, a singing duck (one of the first talkies -or ""quackies""? ) and goes on to cover my favorite genre, documentaries. Way to much to cover in a review.  I will never feel that watching movies is a waste of time again....as film editor Kevin Yost, puts it:  ""I wasn't wasting my time...I was enriching myself with film history.""  On my viewing list are now two films I have not yet seen: ""The Exiles"", [...] and ""Babyface""  (uncensored, restored version, only - how that film was discovered in its entirety is worth the price of admission).",1463875200,,1323,4.823008849557522

The film gives a lock at the nomination and voting process as well as the preservation process for these films.
