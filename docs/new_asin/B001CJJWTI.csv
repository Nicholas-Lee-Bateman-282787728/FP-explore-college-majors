8287960,3,B001CJJWTI,"Received this blu-ray as a gift and couldn't wait to get it on. This is another one of those blu-ray discs that simply isn't blu-ray quality. Unfortunately, the other blu-ray title gifted to me was Elton John's Red Piano Concert, the video quality of which, once again is appalling.

I did wonder if there's something wrong with my blu-ray player (Panasonic BD80) but a google search reveals quite a view similar comments about the poor video quailty of these discs.

I'm not saying 'Don't Buy' (well certainly not the Oasis disc, which is watchable though not brilliant) but be aware you're not getting the video quality you should expect from a blu-ray format.",1319932800,2,662,4.849557522123894
