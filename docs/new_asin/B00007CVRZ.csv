1805775,1,B00007CVRZ,"Bleed (2002) Debbie Rochon, Danny Wolske, Allen Nabors, Orly Tepper, Ronnie Gene Blevins, Julie Strain, D: Devin Hamilton. After fish-out-of-water Rochon gets invited to her young boss's party, his circle of friends and him (around a hot tub) explain to her about their Murder Club. When she is convinced to join, she kills a woman, and it turns out there was no Murder Club, but a real killer does prowl in her path. Strikes a similitude to a college filmmaker's effort with shoddiness and common story; the suspense is traded in for repulsive splatter.  Running Time: 82 minutes and rated R for strong violence, gore, sexuality, nudity, and language.",1057017600,4,652,4.981651376146789
1805776,1,B00007CVRZ,"I rented this movie on impulse a few weeks ago, thinking that it sounded like a fun, if stupid, horror movie. Firstly, it wasn't scary. The rediculous premise and bad writing, directing, and acting made that impossible.
Aforementioned problems aside, I might mave been able to enjoy this movie had it been a bit higher budget. The low-low-low budget is so apparent it's distracting. Throughout the entire movie, the cast drinks out of red plastic cups. Even wine!
The only plus (And that's stretching it) was how comfortable the cast clearly was with each other. Every actor in the film shed their clothes at least once, and they didn't seem in the least bit nervous. The (surprisingly) graphic sex scene should have earned the film an NC-17 rating, especially in the extended version seen in the deleted scenes section on the DVD.
All in all, do not rent (or even think about buying) this movie. If you want a good horror movie, check out the far superior ""Scream"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street.""",1056672000,9,996,4.763005780346821
1805777,3,B00007CVRZ,"For a low budget movie, ""Bleed"" sports a stylish cast, who act fairly well together, an ok script and lots of fun. The movie as a whole isn't the best and the ending was not very satisfying. The killer is someone that you would never suspect because you don't care about them. ""Bleed"" is however, a bit different than most of your ""average"" slasher movies. It has horror, and alot of nudity. It is like a porno movie with a really good script (in case you are wondering, a bad script in movieland is the same as a good script in porno land.) There are scenes where people just walk around totally naked for no reason, which isn't at all that bad, as long as they are all female. Overall, bleed isn't totally your run-of-the-mill horror film, it has a pretty good cast, an okay plot, and some stylish directing, but in the end, it fails to overcome it's very low budget feel, as the screen quality and camera work is fairly below-par.

1805778,3,B00007CVRZ,"For a horror movie, I guess it wasn't as bad as it could have been. The filming quality was a little low in some scenes, and some dialogue didn't seem realistic, but other than that, this movie was a pretty good horror movie. There was a large amount of nudity,but most of it had nothing to do with the plot. There were a few funny lines here and there and a good plot twist at the end. I think the best part about this movie was the story, I don't think it's been done before.",1049241600,,477,4.031578947368421
1805779,3,B00007CVRZ,"This horror flick's willingness to display, I would say, a good amount of male nudity is to be extremely commended and encouraged. I don't recall seeing a horror film ever that contained a slight majority of male nudity. I'd said it's about 55%/45% in favour of male nudity. It's hilarious to read all the male heterosexual protest on this page about the ""ungodly"" amount of male nudity in this film, in chat rooms, etc. You'd think men did 95% of the nudity. It goes to show you how uncomfortable straight men continue to be with having to view the male body as an erotic form. Most straight guys don't like to appreciate the male body in such lights - it makes them feel gay. The hetero male backlash to this film makes it and the male nudity in it all the more hotter.",1048809600,5,771,4.398601398601398
1805780,3,B00007CVRZ,"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie, and in the end I thought it was just ok, but then I remembered that it was a Full Moon film (the Shadow label is under Full Moon).  That changed my view on the movie.  For a Full Moon film, this one is gold.
First off, the death scenes.  The director didn't skimp one bit on those.  People are graphically gutted, stabbed,shocked, and smashed.  Deffinatly a plus, especially in an age were gore is hard to come by in slasher films.
Then there is the acting.  The cast had potential.  All the actors showed some talent, but in the end the script held them back at times.  Sometimes things just seemed odd or out of place, and at others they seemed to flow fine.  This is the first film I have seen with Debbie Rochon, and I have to say that, for a Scream Queen, she is a pretty good actress.  The man who played Simon also did a decent job with what he was given.
On the other hand things tend to move a little to slow for a film like this.  A slasher film really shouldn't have a deep plot.  This film attempts it, but in the end just falls flat. Although I do have to say that the ending was nice and bitter.
For anyone who is looking for a nice gooey slasher film, I have to say this is a winner.  Oh, just one warning, there is an ungodly amount of guy [rear] in this movie. Almost every male character in this film (with the exception of one) is naked at some time or another.  Kind of odd for a film that is aimed at a mostly male audience.  Still, good for gore fans, others will probably be bored out of their skulls.",1042502400,2,1572,4.108196721311476

1805783,1,B00007CVRZ,"This movie might look like a pretty cool movie: a psyco killer with a cool-looking mask that obviously is going to try to kill people on the cover, right? RIGHT! It was all very predictable. Also, the killer has a pretty stupid motive of killing his victims. Besides, all of his victims were killed for no particurlar reason. The person who wrote this movie obviously just wanted to create a movie just for the heck of it. And to top that, the first 30 minutes of the movie is all the characters (guys and girls) come to a party, take off their clothes, and swim and guzzle boos.

1805798,2,B00007CVRZ,"[good things]

Debbie Rochon was one of the few good things, small appearances by Julie Strain, Brine Stevens, Lloyd Kauffman and Lizzy Strain also helped this movie. However, it would take more than that. The thought og the plot was actually pretty good. The way it was carried out was not. There were a couple good kills (The throat slash, and the lady Maddie kills in the parking garage) in the movie, but there was way too many slow moments.

[the bad]

The problem is that they tried to take a cast full of beautiful 'girl and boy next door' types and put then into this 90210 meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre situation, and it did not work. The people just turned out being jackasses and I was actually happy to see them die for tricking Maddie (Debbie Rochon). The acting, or course was horrible, there was a ball shot on a guy, which was funny, not enough female nudity, and very little blood. The ending of the movie also pissed me off.

[final thoughts]

Sadly, this movie is probably one of Debbie Rochon's best, character and acting-wise. Her character was great. Very likable, beautiful and well developed. That is about as deep as this movie got. I really found it hard to sit through this movie, and kept hoping for the movie to get back to Maddie's scenes. I always find it hard to hate movies, because even the worst movies have very good things about them. I would have liked alot more blood, more nudity and of course, a different ending.",1136246400,2,1454,4.534351145038168
1805799,1,B00007CVRZ,bleed sucked BIG time the movie is so stupid heres a shot little summary about it a girl meets a guy they have sex and he shows her to his friends they are drunk and they tell her they are in a murder club if you want to be in the club you have to kill someone how lame!! they were just joking but she takes it for real and kills someone and one of her frinds kills the whole cast and kidnaps her in the end its stupid!! the blood and kills loook so fake and the camera is crap when you are watching it the color and everything is crappy you can tell this movie took like 50 bucks to make don't see this movie you will be unhappy if you do ITS JUNK,1128124800,,648,3.7720588235294117

1805801,1,B00007CVRZ,"This is the stupidist, most low-budget fake-horror movie I have ever partially seen. There's no suspense or mystery, just a lot of sitting around naked. I couldn't even make it all the way through the movie much less halfway. We returned it that same day. Total disappointment. It's not what it seems and don't waste your time or even a penny. We now joke it's the worst movie we've ever rented tied w/ Garden of Evil.",1089849600,3,418,4.5131578947368425
1805802,3,B00007CVRZ,"""Bleed"" has an intriguing premise.  A guy tells his new girlfriend about ""The Murder Club"", of which he and his friends are members.  To become a member you have to kill somebody first.  Strangely, the girlfriend doesn't appear to be too disturbed by this news and she soon becomes a member by kiling an obnoxious woman in a parking garage.
Predictibly, a masked killer starts bumping off the members of the club one by one.  Who could it be?
""Bleed"" is far from a perfect movie.  There are lots of loose ends that are never tied up by the film's somewhat abrupt conclusion.
However, if you're tired of run of the mill slasher pics(and there are too many to list), you may want to give ""Bleed"" a chance.  It could have been a lot better, but there's much worse out there... believe me I've seen 'em!",1079568000,5,799,4.438356164383562
1805803,2,B00007CVRZ,"A masked killer is doing people in.  A crazy woman starts a new job.  The Murder Club.  These are the elements of a twisted tale of insanity and murder that tries hard but makes little sense.
The movie starts with a pair of gruesome killings (including a topless Julie Strain).  We then meet the main character who definitely has a screw loose or two.  When she is invited to an uninhibited party, she is told of The Murder Club.  Details are given of how each person managed to murder someone.  For some reason she is not very bothered by the concept (reasons for this are shown in a flashback with Brinke Stevens).
Who is the killer and what is their motive becomes the main issue after the next killing.  The killings then come fast and furious until the final revelation.
Unfortunately we don't find out the reason for the first two murders at the film's opening as they seem to be outside the scope of the motive.  We also don't get an explanation for the dreams/flashbacks.  Are they a red herring, meant to have been explained, a big mistake, etc.?
I am sure some people with actually enjoy the movie for its violence, nudity and sex but I can't imagine there will be many.",1076976000,5,1180,4.47196261682243
1805804,1,B00007CVRZ,"Bleed is the sort of movie that doesn't even merit the time to type a review.  As a public service, however, I will do what I can to deter people from possibly renting this piece of garbage.
The plot is strictly formula slasher flick.  The killer walks around with a mask (gosh, how original) and methodically kills people.  The whole movie looks like it was made by a couple of amateurs who were given a video camera and decided to recruit their friends.  I suppose you could watch this with your own friends and have fun arguments as to whether it was the acting, direction or writing that was the worst; a good case could be made for all three.
I suppose if you like seeing topless women, you might find some virtue in this movie, but you're better off renting a porn flick which will probably even have better production values.  I've given one-star reviews before, but most of those movies are virtual Citizen Kanes compared to this one.  Actually, this movie aspires to reach the one-star level.
Actually this DVD does have a little worth.  If you actually were compelled to buy it (maybe you were related to a cast member), you do have a shiny new coaster for your drinks.",1067731200,7,1179,4.507042253521127

7975039,3,B00007CVRZ,"Look it's almost impossible for a slasher film to be outright boring, and Bleed is definitly not boring. Sure it isn't a great movie all around, but does it really matter? Slasher fans are usually alot more forgiven when it comes to technical aspects anyways.

The plot is very simple. A woman gets invited to join her new boyfriends ""murder club"", and soon enough members of the club begin to be picked off by a killler in a white mask.
As you see it's pretty basic, but basic is all this film really needed to be. The directing is just ok, the acting is nothing more than passable, and there's not a scare in sight, but who cares? Bleed is never once boring, and that is all that really matters here.
Now the amount of nudity in this film seems to be mentioned alot, but honestly there's not as much as people like to claim. There's a pool scene where everyone strips down (both male and female), and that's pretty much it. The cast are all in great shape, and are all attractive. It's a bit of an extended scene, but nobody's eyes are gonna be sore or anything :p. *shrug*.
As for the gore? There's some gory scenes (the opening is pretty gory), but nothing over the top or anything.
The dvd itself has quite a few deleted or extended scenes, some bios, a script reading, and some trailers. Most people will probably skip the extras, but there's some if people are interested.

Overall I like Bleed. It's not worth watching if you don't like the genre of course, and there's plenty of other better slasher films to watch if you're just starting out on the genre, but it's worth at least one watch for slasher film superfans.",1382313600,,1627,4.438127090301004

7975041,3,B00007CVRZ,"Bleed was going to win picture of the year.  The movie certainly is not the best movie ever made.  Bleed does not add anything original to the standard slasher film premise.  So, what is Bleed and why did I give it three stars?

Bleed has good production values and lots of violence and T&A.  In this day of straight to DVD low budget horror where spit and polish are almost extinct, Full Moon took the time and money to give the movie a more professional look than many straight to DVD movies.  From the flashy graphics at the beginning to the satin finish on the rest of the movie, it looks like what you would expect to see from a bigger production company.

The actors were mostly newbies when this film was made and they do come off very stilted.  Oddly enough, Rochon was a veteran of over 80 films as this point and she seemed to come off the most wooden.

Even though I'm not a fan of slasher movies, I will admit that I really liked the idea behind the Murder Club and got wrapped in it quite a bit.  The poor scripting and junior level acting aside, it's a very watchable slasher film that is not meant to take your breath away, just entertain you for a while.  In the end, that is what Full Moon production does well.

On the flip side, my wife read this review and laughed out loud.  So, there you go...",1281657600,2,1315,4.232931726907631
7975042,2,B00007CVRZ,"While a complete piece of cheese, this movie is actually pretty funny to watch if you aren't expecting any kind of true horror quality.  This movie is about this crazy broad Maddy (played by one of the worst actresses ever- Debbie Rochon) who gets this job at a generic company, where she meets her new boss Shawn, goes on a date with him, sleeps with him on their first date, and goes to a nude pool party with him, all within a two day span.  Yeah..
At the pool party, Shawn's extremely lame friends start to tell Maddy about their ""Murder Club"" in which they knock people off for the pure thrill of it.  Sounds interesting doesn't it?  Don't be deceived- this group of friends are about as likeable as Nazis. When the masked killer starts off-ing them, you actually root for the killer!
And I won't even get into how the girls were wearing ""mom jeans"" in 2002...  Lame!
All in all, this movie is definitely a good one to watch and laugh if you are bored one night, but I'd almost suggest shoplifting it over buying it, as it is not worth the money you will spend.",1233532800,,1066,4.336683417085427

What more can you expect or ask for in these kind of films. It does remind me  alot of ""Scream"" and ""Friday the 13th"", but to a much lesser degree.
