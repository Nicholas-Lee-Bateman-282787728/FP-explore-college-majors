2464835,4,B000CGX7FC,"A terrific horror film, ""The Dark Hours"" starring Kate Greenhouse and Aidan Devine  stands apart from other scary movies because it is very realistic, which is one of the reasons why it is a must-see motion picture. The film tells the story of a psychiatrist who wants a break from her crazy life so she goes to retreat at a cottage with her family. But that gets suddenly interrupted when one of her patients pays a visit seeking revenge. With many twists in the plot it will leave you guessing what's going to happen next. A well written story, the intensity will definitely have you at the edge of your seats and deep into the characters world. If you are looking for a horror movie that will without a doubt have your heart racing throughout the whole film, I would highly recommend it.",1139443200,5,790,4.524475524475524
2464836,4,B000CGX7FC,"Dark Hours is a chilling, utterly terrifying look into the mind of a madman. In my opinion, the scariest movie are always the ones that could really happen. The movie begins as an inexperienced doctor (Kate Greenhouse) and her husband and sister arrive at her family's winter cottage to spend a peaceful weekend.  But what starts out as a pleasant weekend getaway turns into a night of unadulterated horror.  One of her father's patients, Harlan Payne (Aidan Devine) a violent sex offender, has returned to exact revenge and he doesn't care who from.  This movie graphically shows what terrible evil the night may hold and gives all who see it good cause to spend their ""dark hours"" huddled in fear.",1138924800,6,699,4.808333333333334
2464847,4,B000CGX7FC,"If you only like films with big explosions and shallow storylines, this isn't the film for you. If you enjoy psychological thrillers, twists and turns, indie, low-budget gems, then you will be pleasantly surprised. I am an avid film-lover, from the big Hollywood productions to the indie hand-held labors of love.

This is an intense, complex, psychological thriller that is acted very well. The direction and cinematography impressed me a great deal. I don't find many films with smart, layered scripts. For the first 15 minutes, I was a bit off-kilter. It did jump around. But, I found if I just relaxed and didn't try to figure everything out, the film ended up more enjoyable. It doesn't spell it out for you or hold your hand the way that most big budget films do. This is a thinking person's film.

Unlike some of the reviewers, I didn't find the ending confusing at all. I will say, though, that I did not like the alternate ending. While it was well-done, I thought it completely changed the tone and meaning of the story. I am one of those people who don't need a ""happy ending"" with all the questions tied up in a little bow. I like a little mystery. I like to stretch my mind.

There were some disturbing scenes in the film that may put some people off. Without giving too much away, the dog thing was very hard for me to watch. It was one of those, ""it's only a movie!"" moments for me. There is not much gore, but what there is, is cringe-worthy.

Overall, I recommend this film for those who want to mentally participate in the unfolding of a interesting and challenging story.",1212451200,,1590,4.529616724738676
2464848,4,B000CGX7FC,"Dark Hours was a lot better than I was expecting.  Never hearing about this film prior to seeing it for rent, I was a bit skeptical.  Luckily, I was really surprised by the character development and gritty realistic feel this film had.  Contrary to other reviews, I did not have it all figured out from the start.  I was pretty confused even as the credits were up and rolling.  Confused in a good way.  A way that made me want to go back and watch it all over again.  Recommended.",1161475200,5,481,4.277777777777778
2464849,3,B000CGX7FC,"This is generally a worthwhile thriller, although for a little while I was afraid it was going to degenerate into just another repugnant case of sadistic home invasion. However the larger context rescues the film from that slush pile and advances it into some interesting psychological territory.

Similarly, I was leery of the fact that the bonus materials on the DVD listed ""alternative endings."" Alternative endings usually signal to me that the people who made the movie had no semblance of a coherent artistic vision, but were only interested in gauging what would sell the most tickets. However it turned out that the alternates here aren't a testing of wildly different conclusions, but are varying extensions of the same basic conclusion. It was just a question of how far to elaborate the one idea. So there was no compromise of integrity, casting about here, there, and everywhere for the biggest fish.

There are some lapses of logic along the way, and I'm not sure the surprises could stand close analysis. Nevertheless, the film held my attention, concentrating me into a dark place of anger and despair",1161216000,11,1116,4.994623655913978
2464850,4,B000CGX7FC,"The Dark Hours is an interesting Canadian synthesis/update of two ideas that can probably never be filmed too much--The House In the Woods and The Monster From the Id. Although it's not an especially great film, nor did it especially engage me in an emotional sense, it's rather a treat to see such a well-made horror movie--particularly given its budget. As revealed in the filmmakers' commentary, The Dark Hours counterbalances the glut of horror movies focused on screaming teens in the suburbs. It relies more on subtle and intelligently wrought moments than on squibs and prosthetics, although it makes some use of those goo-spewing tools. And other tools, for that matter. Also, there are some surprises if not outright twists here.

It's clear even without the commentary that the filmmakers love their chosen medium. References to other works and directors abound. Even so, the overall film has its own identity. And the actors' performances are uniformly realistic given the subject matter. All of which makes for a very believable (and enjoyably ambiguous) psychological horror/thriller movie worthy of thoughtful contemplation.",1159228800,2,1138,5.35754189944134
2464851,2,B000CGX7FC,"This movie is not worthy of seeing.  My advice: don't waste your time or money.

Kate Greenhouse stars as Samantha Goodman, a doctor at a psychiatric facility.  She learns in the first few minutes of the film that she has an inoperable brain tumor whose progress has only increased over the past year.  She has hallucinations and occasionally will blank out and see people's mouths moving, but hear no sound.  That's the first sign of things to come.  Hmmmm....doctor....growing brain tumor....regular hallucinations....welcome to the stupid and predictable plot of The Dark Hours.

Sam calls up her husband on the phone (she hallucinates that he's in her office talking to her) and tells him she wants to spend the weekend with him.  He knows she is sick and has a tumor, but he is not aware of the results she's gotten from the most recent tests.  He tells her that he is busy and he has to finish writing his book, so he can't.  He will be too busy with her younger sister, who is apparently jobless and still living at home.  She helps him ""edit"" his work.

Sam leaves and proceeds to join them anyway at their cabin in the woods.  Not long after she arrives, there is a knock at the door, and a stranger comes into the house.  Then the unthinkable happens--a patient of Sam's who was in a coma and not likely to live suddenly shows up at their door too.  Apparently the first guy is his accomplice, and they are out to torture and terrorize Sam and her family.

What's going on here really?  Will Sam be able to escape with her life?  And what will happen to her husband and her little sister?

You can find most of this info out from reading other reviews.  I just thought I would add my 2 cents worth.  I thought this movie was boring.  The acting was poor, especially Sam's sister.  The psychopathic drifter, the madman's apprentice, was also very corny and poorly acted.  The plot twists were all supposed to be shocking revelations, but really they were simply predictable and staid.  They've been done before, and better, in many other films.  There was not a single moment of anything even resembling tension or scariness in this film.

I saw this film for free, so I can't complain about wanting my money back.  However, to those of you who have not yet offered up your money, DON'T BOTHER!  It's a huge waste of time.  Go see something else that's more worthwhile, and leave this on the shelves where it belongs.",1152057600,9,2426,4.548611111111111
2464852,3,B000CGX7FC,"The first time I viewed this - on DVD - I was impressed - not completely convinced/overwhelmed - but impressed enough to rent yet again - ok, I had a free rental coming - but I HAD to have a listen to the filmmaker's commentary.  The commentary is excellant - talky, but not too talky, etc.  What I do not understand - maybe someone else out there has noticed - during the commentary - the filmakers make one or two references to the closing credits.  WHERE ARE THEY?  Also, the commentary seems to get cut off mid-sentence at the film's end - then - blackness.  It works, but I get the feeling I'm being cheated out of something!  A problem with Freestyle Home Entertainment?",1151280000,3,676,4.411290322580645
2464853,2,B000CGX7FC,"Ok,  I'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn.  This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon.  It really doesn't take a genius to figure out this plot.  I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film's plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!!",1143331200,3,550,4.11214953271028
2464854,3,B000CGX7FC,"While THE DARK HOURS certainly has its terrifying momments, it lets us down when by the end we are not really sure how much of what has transpired is real or imaginary.  It is also a trifle sadistic in its tone, which makes it all the more disturbing and uncomfortable.  Kate Greenhouse does a commendable job in the leading role, with good support from Gordon Currie, Aidan Divine, and Iris Graham.  I don't mind ""twists"" in movies; in fact, I Love them...but when they come out of nowhere and make little sense or require immense examination, they aren't as satisfying.",1142812800,4,571,4.69
2464855,5,B000CGX7FC,"I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular.  It, honestly, is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while.  It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and it definitely kept me captivated.  Everything is really good: the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the music, everything.  Kate Greenhouse plays her role perfectly and Paul Fox does a great job putting this film together.  And the plot is simple yet it's really creative (the twists totally caught me off guard).  All in all, if you're looking for a thriller, this is one of the better ones out there.",1140048000,11,581,4.647058823529412
2464856,5,B000CGX7FC,"As said before, Dark Hours is about a psychiatrist who decides to go to her family's cottage to spend time with her husband and her sister.  The weekend was meant for relaxation but it goes totally wrong when one of the patients shows up at the cottage.  He's a criminally insane, violent sex offender and he wants revenge on the doctor because he believes she conducted experiments on him.  Once he gets there, the horror begins.

It is scary because it's believable.  The characters react in believable ways.  I was never mad at the characters for doing something that'll obviously get them into trouble which is something I can't say for most horror flicks.  And Kate Greenhouse totally plays the part perfectly and the movie totally makes you care about what happens next.  It's pretty graphic but not in an overdone, obviously fake way which keeps it realistic.  So yeah, this is definitely the best horror movie I've seen in a pretty long time.",1139529600,7,950,4.7439024390243905
8098999,4,B000CGX7FC,"This is a very interesting film. It is a thriller, in which a violent former patient takes his revenge upon his former clinical psyciatrist by playing games with her, her husband and her younger sister after having broken into their cabin in the middle of the snowy woods along with a younger friend. The psychiatrist, Dr. Samantha Goodman, like the former patient, has an inoperable brain tumor, and in the end the plot gets confusing to the extent that one can not be sure whether the things she experiences are real or just hallucinations emanating from the brain tumor. Either the patient, Harlan Pyne, is doing all the nasty things to her, playing a sadistic game, or she is doing it to herself, haunted by imaginary ghosts from the past, triggered by the affair she discovers is going on between her husband David and her younger sister Melody.",1502409600,,850,4.75

8099005,4,B000CGX7FC,"The Dark Hours (Paul Fox, 2005)

Another one of those movies that got lost in the shuffle over the years for some reason, The Dark Hours is actually a pretty solid little psychological thriller. It loses its way a little in the end, which tries to tread the line between confusing and ambiguous and comes up on the wrong side of it, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it for what it is--a thriller without too many pretensions. It just wants to entertain you. And it will.

Samantha Goodman (Kate Greenhouse, currently appearing in the TV series Murdoch Mysteries) is a psychiatrist who works at a mental institution. She has a secret, though; she's got a brain anomaly of her own, a tumor that she'd been able to keep in check for years with medication, but which has suddenly started growing again. After a particularly nasty session with a patient, Harlan Pyne (Dolan's Cadillac's Aidan Devine), where she judges that he needs to remain confined, she, her husband, and her sister Melody (The Exorcism of Emily Rose's Iris Graham), who also works as her husband's editorial assistant, head off to their remote cabin for the weekend to decompress. Things start to go wrong when Adrian (You Might As Well Live's Dov Tiefenbach) shows up, claiming a breakdown; he's just a shill however, for Harlan Pyne, who's escaped the hospital and now plans revenge on Samantha by hurting those closest to her.

It all sound pretty straightforward, and for the most part it is. That is not necessarily a bad thing; a good thriller, crafted well, is usually worth watching. Fox (Everything's Gone Green) and screenwriter Wil Zmak (on his first feature-length assignment), though, are after something more. It's frustrating that they almost-but-not-quite manage it in the final ten minutes of this movie, but enough of what they were after actually made it into the movie that you can pick up on what they were doing without having to have it entirely spelled out for you (in other words, the ending works better that that of Twohy's A Perfect Getaway, but not as well as Singer's The Usual Suspects). There's mostly solid acting to be found here, and Fox knows where to put a camera and the lights to get atmosphere out of a scene; what more could you ask for in a thriller, really, other than a slightly better-crafted ending? This one has been much-overlooked for the past five years. Pick a copy up and help rectify that at your earliest convenience. *** ",1282608000,,2451,4.773584905660377
