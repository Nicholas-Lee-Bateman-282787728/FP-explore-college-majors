6081018,5,B00GKP70W0,"I just got done watching ""The Lottery of Birth"". Wow, what can I say except thank you to the film maker Raoul Martinez.
This film puts into words and pictures something we as all human beings need to think about.",1418860800,2,212,4.325
6081019,5,B00GKP70W0,THIS FILM IS A TOTAL GAME CHANGER.IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED WATCHING FOR EVERYONE AND IT SHOULD BE WATCHED FREQUENTLY SO THAT THE MESSAGE CAN BE ABSORBED OVER AND OVER AND SINK INTO ONE'S DNA.I HAVE WATCHED IT FREQUENTLY IN THE PAST YEAR AND EVERY TIME I DO I FEEL RECHARGED.I NOW LIKE TO GIVE IT AS A GIFT TO PEOPLE WHO WILL GAIN THE MOST FROM IT.,1409097600,8,344,4.149253731343284
6081020,5,B00GKP70W0,"What do we value? Truth or comfort? Can we have both? This documentary is very well thought out if for nothing else the questions it asks but the questions it makes the viewer ask themselves. It is hard to tell a story or approach subjects like this in a linear fashion without digressing down many interesting side-stories of interest. Howard Zinn's and other's historical anecdotes of murder, violence, slavery, injustice and oppression illustrate a lot of points. The format was well thought out and the excerpts of the various commentators really good about bringing perspective. I feel like most of the people who are interested in subjects like this tend to be considered liberal but I would add that there is a lot of information for the those with a libertarian streak as well or even ""real"" conservatives who consider their personal freedom limited. My mother used to tell me that ""You can't fight city hall"" which I think she might have gotten from her parents. I am glad I never agreed with her on this and go one step beyond that and ask ""What is City Hall (i.e.the power or authority or organizing principles of me, my family, my culture, my nation, my world)?",1408924800,9,1173,4.726829268292683
6081021,4,B00GKP70W0,"Watched it on Amazon Prime.  Interesting, although I didn't care for the socialist political bias.  Bought the DVD because my wife wanted to show it to her students in a psychology class.  Would not have purchased it otherwise.",1401494400,,227,4.921052631578948
6081022,5,B00GKP70W0,This opened the door for many possible writing prompts.  I encourage any teacher to show clips from this video in order to get students to open their eyes to the world around them.,1398729600,3,180,4.454545454545454
6081023,5,B00GKP70W0,"Calling a spade a spade is something I always admire and this movie does it brilliantly. It's so easy for us to settle into what we're taught and not see the reality of the larger picture. We cling to habits calling them comfortable and secure when in fact this is detrimental to our well being. ""The Lottery of Birth"" takes the viewer down the road of logic for a journey about freedom and choice. It calls attention to the regulations and restrictions placed upon us by society, the government and especially our employment situations. The interviews of great thinkers in our time clear the muddy waters of our training and pull us to the surface where we can see the clear need for change. Talk is not enough. Solutions are needed. If the world is to improve, the masses must re-structure it and a new definition of ""free"" is needed. We are all affected. We need to open these valuable conversations, wake up, smell the coffee, and devise action plans for moving forward. This movie is a tremendous jumping off point for making this happen.",1395964800,10,1043,4.643243243243243
6081024,5,B00GKP70W0,"I watched this one on Amazon Prime and found it to be one of the most awakening, thought and action provoking documentary I've see for a while.  Unlike those contemporary documentaries on environmental/global crisis issues that draw your attention temporarily (until you go back to your busy rat race) , this documentary features a well selected group of guests (including Howard Zinn) digging into the core of how one falls under the spell and control of the system and presented them in keenly precise terms to the audience.  It calls for every common person to take the responsibility to be the owner of their thoughts, their belief systems. I've long been the sympathizer of the ordinary people caught in the bigger historical events, I've tended to give them excuses for being the pawn in a situation out of control (such as the character Kate Winslate portrayed in the move 'the Reader').  This film asked me to re-examine this view point and realized that we, as citizens of humanity,all have the responsibility of not being blind to what's happening around us - to look at a historical event from opposite view points, to not take harmful things not directly harming ourselves in oblivion.  It discusses the topics of freedom, obedience, education at a broader and honest level.  At a minimum, it ""clears the head"" for an idealist on how he/she should observe and understand history and current affairs. It was so captivating that I watched it a second time immediately after.",1390348800,13,1484,4.92
6081025,5,B00GKP70W0,"This film, dedicated to the historian Howard Zinn, took me on a stunning and thought-provoking journey. Its approach to key issues today is to pose questions - rather than assume answers. So important at a time when we're encouraged to believe the policies & ideas of others - without examining them thoroughly. The responses to questions put forward - and the ideas explored - are jarring and important. The film captured problems and possibilities in a way that's inspiring. With the strapline ""To take freedom for granted is to extinguish the possibility of attaining it"" it subtly advocates action for a more just and sustainable world driven by solidarity, community, love and compassion. The first in a series - I cannot wait for the others. Thank you for putting this first piece together, and so magically.",1386201600,8,814,4.992647058823529
6081026,5,B00GKP70W0,"Enthralling!! As a bit of a philosopher and thinker myself, this documentary spurs on a remarkable array of possibilities to discuss the essential meanings of life. Watch it in groups, pause and rewind, re-watch with a notepad. And always keep asking why!!",1385856000,10,256,5.119047619047619
