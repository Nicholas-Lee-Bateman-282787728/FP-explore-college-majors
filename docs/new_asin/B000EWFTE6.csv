8115118,4,B000EWFTE6,"good DVD that looks into the behind the scenes of big wave riding and photography.
It also looks into the circus that follows.
I bought the DVD because I am interested in big wave surfing and bodyboarding and i think the crew that laird surfs with have covered all bases.
There isn't much more big wave stuff than other similar titles, but they have shown new angles and ideas.
Helicopter tow surfing, etc. etc.
I recommend this DVD to anyone keen on Big wave tow surfing, big wave riding in general, people who like and are mature enough to ride different equipment depending on the day.
I also recommend this DVD if you are a fan of Laird Hamilton and his approach to wave riding.",1291161600,3,682,4.464
