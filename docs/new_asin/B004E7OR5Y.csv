8426547,5,B004E7OR5Y,Thank you Carole Maggio!! At last I have taken charge of my cellulite with the No Lipo Lipo DVD.  The technique that Carole teaches in this DVD has helped me smooth my dimpled thighs and reduce my stomach and arms.  My pants are looser now and I look forward to the continued benefits from using the DVD technique.  I strongly suggest this to all women and men looking for a beautiful and smooth body!,1386633600,7,401,4.391891891891892
8426548,3,B004E7OR5Y,"The CD case was broken.  However, the No Lipo Lipo seems like a possible solution.  Some of the before and after photos look a little ""staged"".  Some of the after photos are just a little farther away and the people are a little tanner--so they look better.  But Chaton's change seems quite real and convincing.  The problem is, can you actually do all that work, it's like 20-60 strokes per body section. The strokes are vigorous.  I do massage for a living and I got tired just doing my legs.  So I want to go with this. It's only 2 self session per week.  I'm going to keep trying.  Work it in with my regular workouts, my facial workouts, my needling, showering, toothbrushing, and so forth.  Grinning.  Self obsessed much?  :)",1367366400,12,731,4.4961832061068705
