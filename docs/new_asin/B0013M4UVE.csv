8252149,5,B0013M4UVE,"It may only be 8 minutes long,but it is a killer 8 minutes of the famous punching and kicking of Billy Blank`s classic Tae bo workouts. When I am in training which is usually all the time,since I am a boxer I add this to my killer workout for training. When I am jumping rope,jogging three to seven miles,running on the treadmill of course,and punching the bag of course I put this Tae Bo Get ripped 8 minute workout into my hard training routine for boxing. When I first starting boxing whrn I was twelve years old I was still a big fan of the Firm,Jane Fonda,and Others and adding those to my training and practice for my boxing. My dad who was a boxer himself suggested I add other things to his grueling boxing learning and training,of course he was my first coach. Me being a female made things a little difficult for me being a fighter,so doing Jane Fonda gave me some female images,but being a tomboy I was in to hard core self defense. And I still dig the retro old time good old Kathy Smith stuff. But I have really got into Tae Bo the past four years. And for being only 8 minutes long there are sure a lot punching and kicking. And for people who are not even in training and have different jobs and they are just so busy and pressed for time this is a wonderful workout you guys could fit into your schedule. Plus for people who are not in that great of shape and wanting to lose weight and inches as well as get fit this is a great start for other Tae Bo workouts as well as other kinds of workouts. It may only 8 minutes but let me tell,you do it, it will be a challenge and you will sweat and get a workout. I love Billy Blanks and all his other workout besides boxing training which is grueling I love working out to Tae Bo as will. Trust me you will love it",1283817600,,1774,4.130057803468208
