8172055,5,630423399X,This entire series needs to be put on DVD soon and with many special features!  I loved this show since I was a kid.  The original TV show blows the movies away ... BIG TIME.,1051056000,,174,3.942857142857143
8172056,5,630423399X,"Want to bend your mind a bit? Let the IMF do it with these two as Jim Phelps (Peter Graves) matches wits with hyperintelligent secret agent Stefan Miklos (Steve Ihnat in one of his best performances ever) as Phelps seeks to destroy a spy ring that has penetrated American intelligence by leading the enemy's most accomplished thinker through turn after turn to completely dupe him in the process. When your brain stops hurting with the dense plot and amazing attention to logical detail, try the even more phenomenal ""Live Bait"" where Phelps and the IMF must keep American spy Orin Selby (John Crawford) by being unmasked by enemy security chief Helmut Kellerman (Anthony Zerbe in another fine guest role). Watch for the great subplot with Kellerman's faithless assistant Brock (Martin Sheen) and his scheming girlfriend (Diana Ewing). Buy this video *now*.",976838400,18,857,5.085106382978723
