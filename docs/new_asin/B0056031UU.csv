4581582,5,B0056031UU,"I love this series.  Jaques Pepin is the perfect combination of skilled chef, teacher and performer.  I love the show the most when he talks about the difference between the way they used to do things and how he does it now. For example, my mother would cringe at the notion of cracking an egg directly into a food mixture. What if its bad?  Well Mom, I have never ever gotten a bad one. According to Jacques Pepin it used to be fairly common, but not anymore.  He explains classic techniques and newer techniques, such as the different techniques a person should use if doing something by hand vs a food processor.  You know that one about adding one egg at a time and waiting til its mixed in before you add another when baking? I remember seeing Emeril Lagasse shake his head saying ""Who makes up these rules?""  Well if he watched this show he would learn the story behind that.

Mostly the show focuses on how to make the wonderful dishes he is making, but it is peppered with these gems of knowledge that I find precious.

The only thing he does that I kinda wish he would stop is occasionally having people on with him. Its part of his message that cooking is a labor of love to be enjoyed with friends and family.  That's a beautiful idea. But his friends and family, quite understandably, are just not at ease in front of a camera the way he seems to be.  But its a small thing.  I LOVE THIS SHOW!  Happy Cooking!",1326240000,,1421,4.320754716981132

4581584,5,B0056031UU,At first I thought this series a bit dry - compared to all the silly theatricals that many chefs resort to these days (and the VERY silly Julia and Jacques series).  But I've grown to love it after watching a few episodes and have already learned a lot about what I don't know.  I love Msr. Pepin's charming closing remarks at the beginning and end of each episode.,1323561600,13,365,4.352941176470588
4581585,5,B0056031UU,"Josh Rode, DVD Verdict --Jacques Ppin has been a staple on public television for years, and was a world-renowned chef for decades before that. You know that saying, ""He wrote the book?"" Ppin literally did; his book La Technique is used to teach the fundamentals of French cooking. So when he tells you to slice the corn off the cob by using the upper edge of the knife and cutting straight up toward your exposed chest, you can be assured he knows what he's talking about.

Despite his occasional unsafe advice, Ppin gives clear and detailed instructions, and though I was too lazy to go to the store for ingredients, I felt as if I could have made most of the dishes he demonstrated. He is an unassuming, engaging host whose dishes look so good that your mouth will water as you watch, and you will be tempted to try food that you would otherwise never dream of eating. For instance, I don't like seafood, but Ppin's Sea Bass in Shredded Potato Skin, Oysters Madison, and Poached Salmon in Ravigote Sauce look delicious. He spends an episode on offal, which are the parts of the animals you normally wouldn't think to eat, such as intestines and tails and something called sweetbread--which is neither sweet nor, in fact, bread; it's a really disgusting dish made from the thymus gland. But after he was done with it, I was ready to chow down.

Jacques isn't out to entertain so much as teach, so there is nothing flashy about his presentation. Each episode begins with Jacques, by himself or with a guest, pretending to have dinner. If there is a guest, they will exclaim, ""This is delicious! How did you make it?"" To which Jacques invariably replies, ""This is how I made it,"" and an overview of the recipes he's about to demonstrate runs. Then, after the introductory credits roll, he gets to cooking.

The television aspect ratio has been stretched out for widescreen viewing, and the picture is clear and sharp. The colors are not tremendously vivid, but there is good balance. The basic stereo sound is quite adequate, carrying Ppin's pleasantly accented voice with clarity while allowing the ambient cooking noises to come through as well. There are no extras. My biggest beef with the program is the DVD menus, which have options for selecting individual programs or scenes, but do not have a ""play all"" function, which means that once an episode is finished, the disc goes back to the top menu instead of the next episode. This would be an exceptional ""listen as you do other things"" show if you didn't have to choose another episode every twenty minutes.

4581591,5,B0056031UU,"Wonderful DVD that is lots of fun to watch again and again. Chef Pepin continues his charming presentations by either cooking for the viewers himself, or having occasional guests join him as he prepares and explains lots of delightful things in the ""home kitchen"" looking studio where the DVD was recorded.

The menu structure of the DVD also lets you go directly to the dish you want to watch chef Pepin make, organized by ingredients and title.

I love learning so much about various ingredients and dishes from chef Pepin's DVD, and swapping the various techniques I learn around with different foods and creations. Can't wait to buy some more of the chef's many DVDs and books.",1467158400,,681,4.811965811965812

4581595,4,B0056031UU,"I am working my way through parts of the book. I have to say on the baking section, sometimes I prefer the version of Martha Stewart in her Baking Handbook, as in pate brisee (pie crust). But Pepin is the master so I am keeping the faith. I like to think that no photos in the book don't matter, but there is no question that a great photo of a dish is an inspiration, so I wish the book had a few, but with this book you get the spectrum of his experience, and that is always good to consult when considering a recipe. When in doubt I trust Pepin.",1442448000,,548,3.9909090909090907

Explaining in his wonderful accent, how we can (and I do!) replicate his dishes in our own kitchens, Monsieur Pepin, provides charming dialogue with his patient explanations. The recipes and dishes I have tried have looked like the professional version, tasted wonderful, and impressed both me and my boyfriend.

Not all the recipes are for French food, Mr. Pepin's forte, and there are a variety of dishes that can be made from watching the DVDs. What I love most about watching Jacques Pepin is his simple style which creates dishes which appear complex and time-consuming.",1408147200,,648,5.05607476635514

4581625,5,B0056031UU,"This dvd set is a must have accompaniment to his book, Essential Pepin, which distills all his recipes into one HUGE book. Jacques explains everything so well, and he is so comfortable and adept in the kitchen, that one can't help but pick up some valuable tips. Frankly, I think that he should be given the title as a national treasure in both France and the USA. I've always wished that Jacques was my next door neighbor, so that I could sample his cooking. This video set highlights a great variety of recipes, which are divided into categories such as meat, fish, egg dishes, desserts, etc. I find that the programs go by far too quickly on TV, so it is a wonderful luxury to be able to review his procedures and advice, as often as I wish. The recipe selection is wonderful, easy to learn, follow, and to recreate. The DVD's are extremely well made and expertly presented. Jacques technique is masterful. He does so many things at the highest skill level. His knife skills are tremendous. If one wants to get better at cooking, one has to watch someone much better to learn how to do things properly. Jacques Pepin is probably in the top five of the best chefs of all time. These DVDs are money well spent, and I have greatly enjoyed them. I highly recommend these DVDs, and his book. This is Essential Pepin.",1368748800,,1314,4.502092050209205

4581629,5,B0056031UU,"I love Jacques Pepin. He is the perfect balance of traditionalist and just hands-on butt-kicker. This series has some really amazing gems in it. For sure get the episode about eggs. I have debated the various approaches to omelets since I was young. For some reason, omelets were one of the first things I tried to make. He does the 2 different approaches in a way that is fantastic! It's even better than Julia's awesome Omelet episode.

Hope he does more of these. Great show!",1361145600,,478,4.623529411764705

4581632,4,B0056031UU,"First off, Jacques Ppin is undoubtedly a master in the kitchen.  I've not seen an episode of him such that I've ever been disappointed.  This series is no different.  Why only 4 stars then?

Well, 2 disappointments.  First, the 'run time' is advertised as 780 minutes (13 hours).  That's true but, if you consider 2 hours and 35 minutes of viewing sponsorship promos as run time, then no problem.  I don't.  The actual time viewing Jacques Ppins' cooking is only 10 hours and 25 minutes.  That is quite a difference from the stated 13 hours.  I wish Amazon would be more accurate with this description and make the appropriate change.

The second issue is on Disc 3, concerning the series 'Eggs-Quisite'; that 24 minute program simply will not cue.  I have 2 DVD players which I've tried to view this program with, and neither one will allow it to run.  I suspect it's simply a problem with the stamping of the disc itself, and I'm confident that Amazon will soon have that disc replaced.  We'll see.

In summary, the series is very good, but be advised, there are only 10 hours and 25 minutes of Jacques Ppin cooking.

Update:  I contacted Amazon concerning a disc replacement.  Immediately, a disc was sent to me (with 1-day service!).  There is no further issue referencing the disc.  One couldn't ask for, or receive better service.",1360454400,38,1336,4.676724137931035
4581633,5,B0056031UU,"I enjoy having him by my side while creating in the kitchen. The quality of the video is perfect, Jacques makes you feel as if you can do anything, The film crew did an excellant job.",1360108800,,183,4.111111111111111
4581634,5,B0056031UU,"This DVD is awesome.  Jaques Pepin really teaches you the basics about cooking in a very elegant, useful, and impressive way.  Anything I have made after using this DVD as guidance has been awesome and raved about.  Definitely a great gift for any level chef.",1359417600,,259,4.711111111111111
4581635,5,B0056031UU,"Chef Jacques is one of my ""go to"" sources and to have readily available advice or expertise to help with my cooking is so fantastic...really made me excited to keep trying new cooking methods, at least they're new to me!",1358553600,,220,4.525
4581636,5,B0056031UU,"Mr. Pepin is a certified master and certainly the best teaching chef out there. This book is well worth the money with hundreds of quality recipes ranging from simple to complex. I would highly recommend also buying the three CD companion (not the lone CD that comes with the book), particularly if you have not watched the PBS series of the same name. The CD's cover something like 130 of the 700 plus recipes in the book and are taken from the TV show. Working from the recipe alone can be a handicap in some cases because where it may appear, for example, to be very complex from the reading, as you watch Mr. Pepin prepare it you realize that it is easier than you thought. And the CD's are well worth the investment in their own right; Mr. Pepin is entertaining and informative. And to be able to watch the video and then prepare the dish is special. If you can't learn something from Jacques Pepin you must have otherworldly talent.

Some readers have noted that there are no photos. True but not a fatal flaw. The CD's make up for it.",1357171200,2,1041,4.393782383419689

4581639,5,B0056031UU,Love to watch this guy cook.  I have tried to make many many of his dishes and they all turn out wonderful.  I think it is the simple techniques he uses that makes them so easy to duplicate.  I love the brief glimpse he gives into his past and what France was like when he was a boy growing up ... you get a small snippet of his life when he goes into a story telling about a particular food he is making or if a technique or ingredient brings back a memory for him.  Julia would have been proud of you Jaques .. keep up the good fight .. and Be sure to Taste it and taste it again.,1344124800,2,582,3.825

4581641,5,B0056031UU,"Julia Child and Jacques Pepin have done more for the home chef than any other duo in history.  Jacques continues his quest in teaching the world how to properly cook food and have fun doing it.

What bothers me with many tv chefs nowadays, is that they haven't even gone to culinary school!  To see some using canned items and pre made sauces makes me sick.  Jacques still teaches and is considered an icon in teaching proper cooking skills and he continues to give people inside tips that some chefs pay thousands to learn.

I have to be honest; I really didn't enjoy the fast food my way series.  It was fun to watch him cook but I just didn't enjoy the food he made.  In this series he goes back to creating incredible meals showing us that with proper techniques and practice, we too can attempt these at home.

In this video he teaches us how to make basic recipes that can be used in so many ways.  Items such as how to make proper pastry cream and how to use meringue for different types of desserts are shown.  He also shows us how to cook proper fish and seafood recipes and the importance of a good stock and how to create it.  His love for meat is obvious and his hearty recipes for beef tongue, lamb, and beef are so good it's hard not to cook these recipes on the spot.

His petit choux (cream puff) recipe is still the best I've ever seen and I now make it all the time and teach others to do the same.  He shows people how to make a baked alaskan with ease and no one does a souffle' like Jacques.  The way he makes bread is also explained and even though his is so beyond talented, he teaches us in a way that we are not intimidated and the recipe is easy to follow and try.

The reason Julia and Jacques were so much fun to watch, is they didnt' take themselves too seriously and they inspired us to want to try what they were cooking.  They usually had no recipes and just went on what they had as well as their mood and feel for the food.  They would not allow us to make excuses, and they've taught generations how to make amazing food in the home setting.  This video goes back to the days of showing us how to cook all types of foods with simple techniques that everyone can enjoy.

Even though he's cooked for heads of state, presidents, and prime ministers, Jacques still has the common's man's touch and humbleness to inspire us and make us smile while doing it.  Also included are guest appearances from his grand daughter Shorey and his daughter Claudine (who still can't cook) a few of his chef friends as well as his childhood friend Claude who maybe has lost a step, but still has his dry whit and humor.

With the food network pretty much becoming all fluff and no stuff, with some pretty awful cooking at times; Essential Pepin is a glass of ice cold water in a barren desert.  Julia Child once called him the best chef in the world.  I wholeheartedly agree.",1335657600,53,2890,4.2623853211009175
4581642,5,B0056031UU,"Jacques Ppin's expertise is displayed beautifully in this comprehensive segment. The recipes range, as he says, from simple to elegant -- each of them coming alive and easily replicated, thanks to his informative commentary. He is the ideal host for one of these shows and this series has quickly become one of my favorites.",1334361600,,324,5.018518518518518
4581643,5,B0056031UU,"I have most of Jacques Pepin's cookbooks and dvd's and this is far and away my favorite so far.  The cookbook itself has an amazing variety of recipes and a good percentage are demonstrated on the DVD.  One of the things that I really like about the new DVD is that there's a really good mix of recipes - some very easy and some more challenging in terms of techniques and ingredients.  Whatever he's making though, Jacques takes the time to explain everything in a very straightforward and easy to understand manner without any pretension.  You really get the feeling that the recipes are something that you can recreate at home successfully and all the ones that I've tried so far have been delicious.  I even boned a whole chicken, stuffed and roasted it after watching the dvd - something that would be hard to do just reading a recipe in a book but not that intimidating after watching the step by step demonstration.  Highly recommend the video and the cookbook to anyone who likes to cook.",1332374400,17,996,4.598870056497175
