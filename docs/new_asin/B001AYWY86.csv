3474377,5,B001AYWY86,"After reading the other reviews, I wonder... when did we become so mindless that a movie has to fill in ALL of the gaps and blatantly SPELL OUT everything?  This movie keep you guessing as to who the bad guys are (not one, but at least three) and then ends leaving you to make up your own mind as to the evil purpose behind the game.  It was creepy and allowed you to spend the majority of the movie trying to figure it out and then doesn't force its own morality at the end.  It doesn't make you scream, it makes you think.  What fun is a mystery without surprises?  It's entertaining and creepy. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1226275200,2,631,4.225
3474378,2,B001AYWY86,"The premise of this movie is like, what if you take Saw and crossed it with The Cube? Poof! Breathing Room!
14 Strangers placed in a room trying to figure out how to get out using clues that are revealed as the story unfolds, Each person wearing a jump suit with their contestant Number on it.  As clues are revealed and characters die, the level of paranoia also builds, is one person amongst them the killer?
This movie is ok, not as gory as The Cube, and not as intricately layered as Saw. The drama and the dialogue are pretty intense and the different character types are credible and not too clich . This Movie centers around Tonya the last of the fourteen contestants who wakes up in the dark next to a dead guy. (98% of this film takes place in this room.)  Unlike the cube where the people have to work together, the people in BR must figure out who amongst them is the threat.  And in a very Agatha Christie fashion BR is kind of a horror  And then there was none. The death scenes are definitely not as gory or as thought out as the trap infested rooms of The Cube, or diabolical devices created in Saw.
 However, for a low budget movie it was bloody where it needed to be. Which may have merited a PG-13 rating rather than an Unrated tag. For that matter, if this was an unrated film I'd probably be bored out of my mind  with the regular rated version.
On a down note this movie is trying to hard to be Saw II. A bunch of strangers in a room(in Saw II's case a bunch of people in a house) using clues to get out, and just like in Saw II the last person introduced in the group is a chick and by the end of the movie you can easily guess that she is.......well for the people that haven't seen Saw II I won't spoil it.  Rip off!
The ending of this film is predictable, and held no surprises......at all!
Bottom Line..................If you're going to make a thriller horror make sure that you have an original idea. Not rip off  a couple of movies that are better.  Rent it don't buy it. 2 Stars",1222732800,6,2008,4.194805194805195
3474379,2,B001AYWY86,"""Breathing Room"" is a thrilling ride with a terrible conclusion. Fourteen strangers, thrown into a room together, forced to play some horrible, sadistic ""game."" Basically, it's a blending of ""Saw"" and ""Cube,"" but it still had potential. You're trying to piece it together, trying to figure out the true nature of the players... until the ending. The ending is absolutely TERRIBLE, because it MAKES NO SENSE. At the end of the film, you're left with an empty feeling that there was absolutely no point to anything you just watched. Avoid this movie at all costs.",1222214400,5,561,4.91578947368421
3474380,5,B001AYWY86,"In my view, if a film entertains, it's done its job. This is not the best film ever, it's not even close ... but it is a good low budget horror film that keeps one wondering what's going to happen next, and how it's all going to fit together.",1215820800,2,242,3.9591836734693877

8280273,2,B001AYWY86,"**NO SPOILERS** Found this one interesting and engaging, and I did not see the end coming (well, at least not the character who ends up as the ""last person standing"")... definitely recommended for horror-thriller fans, especially those who enjoy a pyschological isolation twist in which members of a group of strangers who awake or are placed in an unfamiliar location - usually one from which they cannot escape - mistrust one another, and fear for their lives. Acting was subpar to average (depending on the actor), though several performances were distractingly poor. If you enjoy this subgenre of horror (I've seen perhaps 10 films that fit this category), though, you'll definitely want to rent this one. I've watched it twice, and while it was obviously most interesting the first time around, the second viewing was also definitely worthwhile.",1418256000,,850,5.166666666666667
8280274,2,B001AYWY86,"I read this movie took fewer than $25,000 to make.  I believe it!  Just rent out a warehouse, hire some B-actors, and for suspense, turn out the lights in the warehouse when someone is killed!
Silly clues are given to the ""captured"" people as we watch one by one kick off. Even some of the clues remain clueless as some are never explained or answered.
I should have figured out the ending and am upset I didn't.
I would NOT recommend this unless you are totally bored -- even then, there HAS to be something better to watch!",1389657600,,525,4.346938775510204

I don't know if I would have enjoyed Breathing Room as much if I had not seen the other one first, so that I could appreciate how it avoids the trap of seeming like a stage play. Breathing Room is, strictly speaking, not good, with no tension, uneven performances, too much repetition, and a disappointing sputter of an ending. But still if you like puzzle movies, this one makes a gritty virtue out of its shoestring budget into and delivers the goods in a workmanlike way.

8280276,4,B001AYWY86,"After reading all these reviews I was a bit shocked at the level of ranting about similarities of other films the reveiwers saw in this one.  Give me a break!  This is a low budget independent film that delivers.  If you enjoy independent films and you enjoy riding the roller coaster with new names in the business, this movie is a must see.  John Suits is an up and coming writer and director.  Bryce Gerlach certainly has a future in producing. Watch for them both in films to come.  This movie is exactly as sold - a great thriller with twists and turns and deeper meanings throughout.  An excellent evening of fun!",1232668800,,619,4.473214285714286
8280277,5,B001AYWY86,This movie is great for any horror fan. Good plot and believable special effects keep you glued to the screen. Well worth adding to your collection!,1231286400,,148,4.730769230769231
8280278,2,B001AYWY86,"Independent movies can be really great....or really disappointing. This particular example has some of both characteristics. Compared to some of the independently-produced disasters I have suffered through recently, I would have to say that the acting was quite acceptable, the inevitable hand-held camera work was not only well done but actually accentuated the uncertainty of the events taking place, the sound quality was good (you could actually understand the dialog), and the majority of the plot was able to maintain my interest. In fact, up until the final few minutes, I would rate this as a better-than-average independent production. But then they dropped the ball.

I cannot explain my dissatisfaction without revealing some plot details, so if you intend to see this movie, perhaps you should read the following after watching it and then see if you agree.

The conclusion was simply not satisfactory. After investing about 90 minutes of your life watching a suspenseful story, you are entitled to a plot resolution that makes the investment worthwhile, or at least makes sense. Other reviewers have discussed the plot in some detail, so I won't bore you with another recap, but at the end, when it appears that the most obvious person was indeed a homicidal maniac, sneering while gouging the one likeable character with broken glass, we get a tour of the entire facility. It is a scientific research center, with lab-coated personnel monitoring every moment of the slaughter that has transpired. In fact, the homicidal maniac must also be a scientist, since she carefully reviews some files and makes some notes in a journal, before entering another room full of innocent (and not so innocent) victims to begin another gore fest.

In what parallel universe do homicidal maniac-scientists run a continuous series of experiments in which test subjects are brutally murdered? What was gained by the experiment? What do we, the audience, gain from this experience? If frustration and disappointment are your goals, then I guess this cinematic experience would be fulfilling, but to me it is simply a matter of a lazy, unimaginative screenplay. They assume that some gore and suspense will justify the time and money we spend on their product, and that we will simply overlook their inability to bring it all to a reasonable conclusion. In my opinion, they are wrong, and I regret that they effectively ruined a fairly good movie with a really lousy ending. With a little more effort and originality they could have created something really good. It's a shame they didn't.",1229558400,10,2582,5.113744075829384
