7634977,1,B01BHDVI8G,"This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. I can't figure out who is giving it good reviews her on Amazon?

The plot is about a woman who goes to Italy and makes a deal with the devil to have a baby. When she returns home she starts having nightmares and seeing visions of demons.

The problem is the movie is NOT SCARY and the acting is SO AWFUL. The director seems to ""borrow"" a lot from other horror films. There is one scene that is a complete rip-off of Rosemary's Baby.

Tony Todd (Candyman) was listed as one of the stars but he doesn't show up until the end and had a very small role. I actually felt bad he had to take this part.

I advise other horror fans to skip this movie - it's very, very BAD.",1461974400,10,722,3.9930555555555554

7634979,4,B01BHDVI8G,"At first the main character comes off as unlikable and some characters come and go, but the story kept me watching and 24 hours after the fact, am still thinking about it. The ending I was not expecting at all.",1461628800,,210,4.275
7634980,5,B01BHDVI8G,"I loved this movie. This is exactly what I was hoping for when I watched the trailer. Shari Shattuck was great as Mirium Jones. Mirium suffers from schizophrenia and her husband Gabriel's affair doesn't make things better, in fact, it tears her fragile state apart. Add to it the fact that she wasn't taking her meds. Yeah, a schizophrenic not taking meds, recipe for disaster. For a brief period I felt bad for Gabriel because Mirium was just off of her rocker. Mad as hell, throwing things and just in a blind rage. A whisper brought her to a boiling point, that's how fragile she was. But then freaky things start to happen. She begins seeing things in the house. Artwork moving like in an acid trip. Things really got nuts when people from the area started showing up at her door. This is not an A list movie by any shot. This is B horror but with a great deal of imagination and a whole lot of freak. Once things start to spiral for Mirium, the rest of the movie is just filled with crazy. The people who visit insist on being ""Invited In"". They must be invited in order to cross the threshold. Mirium is curious as to why but doesn't speak the words that allow any of them to cross. That's when the visitors start to turn on her big time. Their appearances change. They look demonic, especially Raven, played by Jane Park Smith. She is the truly terrifying one to Mirium. They surround her house and peer through the windows mocking her, screaming at her and insulting her. They know things about her and they use it against her. Freaky stuff. I love things like that. The people outside trying to get in were the best thing about this movie. Two detectives show up the next day, one played by Tony Todd, the veteran actor of many a horror movies. He has a soft spot for Mirium while his partner, the young one, thinks she is just bat shi^ crazy. In the end you don't know if it was all a hallucination or if it really happened. The very end confirms the truth.",1461628800,3,1967,4.362397820163488

7634982,5,B01BHDVI8G,"If you have a brain and are over 25, this film will appeal to you. ""A beautiful schizophrenic woman is pushed over the edge by her husband's illicit affairs"" is indeed the perfect description of this terror film. Shari Shattuck is brilliant as Miriam. One cannot help but to fall in love with her electifying performance.

Filmed in Venice, Joseph P. Stachura has taken the beauty of that City and made it really creepy. As Miriam returns to the States, things really go wrong and that's where one really has to have a certain level of intelligence to ""get it"".

7634990,2,B01BHDVI8G,"A middle aged woman falls back into madness, is tormented by a cult of demons, or maybe both. Despite some nice production values and the valient acting efforts of Shari Shattuck (she's in 95% of the film) the movie falls into so many typical problems with recent low budget horror movies. There are lots of unnecessary and repetitive jump scars, jump cuts, slowmo sequences, unnecessary dialogue, plots derivative of better movies, and an overwrought and overbearing score. Additionally, the movie is about 20 minutes too long. B-movies have done this for a longtime, but recently seem to be doing more and more of probably for distribution purposes, but Tony Todd - an actor with some horror movie recognition - makes a brief appearance as a detective. Good for a slow October afternoon diversion.",1475884800,,799,5.015037593984962

Okay, maybe I should have just left my review with that, 'cuz that about says it all, man.  This is a woman goes crazy, hallucinates, and the audience doesn't know what's real kind of movie.  And I'd say that up until the final half hour the movie wasn't all that bad.  The acting was pretty good and they did a good job making the strangers behave just odd enough to make you wonder how much was real.  And some of the special effects were quite effective.  I was thinking that many of the sucky parts could have been fixed post production.  Take out a scene here, clean up some effects there, get rid of that Mariachi music or whatever that was when she left Venice..

But then the final half hour happened and I realized that no amount of spit and polish could save this turd.  It's not to say that there weren't some good special effects, 'cuz there were.  But there was so many stupid effects occuring simultaneously (imagine kids in clown makeup with flashlights telling ghost stories or someone with two eye holes cut out of a sheet).. You know, one or two stupid effects and you can get back into it.  But there comes a point when your mind disengages from the story entirely.  I watched the final fifteen minutes with complete disinterest just to see the plot resolve.  And I guess the overall plot was mildly okay.  If all the lousy parts were taken out and the film was widdled down to half an hour, I'd probably give it four stars.  If that helps.",1463356800,3,1628,4.32013201320132
