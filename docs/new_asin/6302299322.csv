7823783,1,6302299322,"I've always loved ordering from amazon and have always been pleased, however this was a huge disappointment. The film quality of this tape was worse than some 20 yr old home movie video. I don't know why the quality was so poor, maybe it was dubbed over alot, its a mystery. Songs were ok, but lighting and filmography were very poor. I also don't care for it when we don't know what songs are on a video either. This has been my one and only disappointment with any order from amazon. This tape appeared to be filmed in the late 70's or early 80's judging from the hairstyles of the fans, and also Merle looked pretty young. However, I doubt if this had anything to do with the quality, it simply was not a very well made tape.",1066780800,2,728,4.282608695652174
7823784,4,6302299322,"Merle Haggard's style is very much a harback to the days of Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Lefty Frizzell and Bob Wills. He can really capture their style and do it very convincingly. However, sometimes he over-tries to be some of his idols (as any Bob Wills cover Haggard does shows) and he thus doesn't have as original a style as a George Jones or a Jerry Lee Lewis. However, Haggard is above the law and this is 100% oldtime country entertainment at its best.",1001289600,3,463,4.523809523809524
