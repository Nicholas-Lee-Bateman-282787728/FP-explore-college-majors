8746960,1,B01ABUYBB2,Would not play on my DVD recorder. Stuck with useless merchandise.  Cannot return since opened. Was not advised of this prior to purchase. Where is Amazon's responsibility.,1517702400,,172,5.37037037037037
8746961,5,B01ABUYBB2,"I watched the first season on PBS and could not wait for the second season to be released in the US so I bought the second season. The second season is better than the first, even though the first season was very enjoyable. The chemistry between the main character blossoms and the story line is interesting and each episodes pushes the story forward instead of revisiting the same issues like some series. The British detective has a sense of humor and the French detective begins to develop one as well. I enjoy a series with a strong, smart, capable woman who is supported and acknowledge by her colleagues for her skills and her faults.",1490918400,,640,4.62280701754386
8746962,3,B01ABUYBB2,"I'm just now ordering this DVD because I found Season 1 to be so entertaining.  I see by other reviews that people are ordering it not realizing it requires a multi-region zone-free DVD player to view it.  In my opinion, it is unconscionable of Amazon to ship these to people without warning them the DVDs are out of their zone.  (Remember when Blockbuster Video and Netflix warned all customers to make sure they had a Blu Ray player before shipping them Blu Ray discs?  Amazon should take some similar responsibility.)  I did a lot of research to learn this myself, and am ordering the multi-region zone-free DVD player on the same order form as the DVD.  I was always a faithful customer of Amazon, but that is changing.  When they stopped putting their customer service phone numbers on every page of their web site, I started looking for other sources for every product I purchase.  I'm purchasing a zone-free DVD player, Season 2 of The Tunnel DVD, and Season 2 of Vis-A-Vis (Locked Up) all on the same order because I know they are compatible.  Amazon makes a fortune off of us and should at least alert us if we are buying items that have uncommon technical requirements for use.",1489968000,2,1187,4.614285714285714

8746964,5,B01ABUYBB2,I find the series wonderfully timed and constructed.  Playing the dvd's will require a region free player (which I bought for the purpose of viewing this series.),1485993600,2,162,5.0
8746965,5,B01ABUYBB2,"Can't seem to watch in the US, only in Europe, so I purchased the season. Great Drama, the Best Series So Far This Year. Must download DVD Player, 5KPlayer, to  play on your windows or mac machine. Download is free. Enjoy!",1484092800,,222,4.414634146341464

8746968,5,B01ABUYBB2,"This is an excellently written series. It is sophisticated in its plot and deep in its character development, specifically as a continuing story coming from the exceptional first series. The acting and direction makes for outstanding TV, the one problem being that we binge watched and ate the whole series up within a few nights.",1473465600,5,330,5.0181818181818185
