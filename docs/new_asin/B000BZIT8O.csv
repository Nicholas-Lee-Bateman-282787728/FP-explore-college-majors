8094862,1,B000BZIT8O,Awful series... just shows pictures of buildings and the narrator rambles useless information with an accent that is hard for children to understand.,1477353600,,149,5.521739130434782
8094863,3,B000BZIT8O,"Like Vemeer and Neal Hurston, Schubert did not become famous until after he died.  The documentary admits that he contracted syphilis and died in his early 30s.  Not only did he have a pronounced chin dimple, so did his father.

The Bloomsbury group did not consist just of writers.  It had painters, sculptures, economists, and others in it.  This work states that Schubert hung with other creative people besides composers.  The work focuses on artwork in which Schubert's image is included.  In the same way that Boy George has only met his influence David Bowie once, the work states that Schubert only met Beethoven once.  The work said Schubert and his buddy Schober often referred to themselves as ""Schobert.""  I guess our portmanteaux like ""Brangelina"" and ""TomKat"" aren't that new.  However, it was surprising to see this combine name in reference to same-sex friends, rather than an opposite-sex romantic couple.

This work can fit into your average high school period without having to show remaining parts on other days.  Still, the work is entirely still images being flashed and only the narrator speaking.  So in our soundbyte-intensive world, this documentary may be seen as dull.  Maybe students in high school or junior high music classes wouldn't be that interested in sitting through it.",1194652800,6,1307,5.075117370892019
