7670763,4,B01BX2B3EK,A good mystery for BBC once again. Why does it seem like BBC gets it right so many times and US keeps disappointing? The song from Dark Dark Dark is haunting but so good that opens up the show.,1473638400,,193,3.9743589743589745

7670768,5,B01BX2B3EK,"This was a well-acted and well-written suspenseful drama. I did want to shake the character Ivy and get her to spill her secrets, but it is probably realistic that anyone who endured such trauma would be recalcitrant. Overall it was a good mini-series, but it did seem to end abruptly.",1471219200,,285,4.72

8751852,4,B01BX2B3EK,"This was not your typical crime story. I liked its novelty. The acting was great. The stories had some holes in it, but were easily overlooked. It definitely is one of those stories that makes you think. Entertaining. I recommend it.",1475280000,,233,4.7073170731707314
8751853,5,B01BX2B3EK,"Thirteen is very well acted five episode UK made miniseries about who girl who calls 999 from a phone box and tells the operator she is Ivy Moxam, she was kidnapped thirteen years ago when she was thirteen, and has just escaped.  The police are fairly skeptical of her story, especially the female detective of the two assigned to lead her case.  To say that the character DS Lisa Merchant immediately probably becomes the most unlikable character in TV history would probably be an understatement.  If audiences were supposed to hate her for her treatment of Ivy, Valene Kane does a brilliant acting job at achieving that.  The best acting by far though goes to Jodie Comer, if she doesn't win all the major TV acting awards for her performance as Ivy, I'd be very surprised.  She brilliantly portrays a girl who is now an adult, but still has somewhat a thirteen year old girl's mindset, as well a person who has been damaged by what her abductor has put her through.

Ivy has to not only cope with a world that has changed, where her little sister, boyfriend and others have grown up and moved on with their lives, but also a mother who takes the negative parental term smother to new heights.  If it wasn't for DS Merchant, she'd be competing for a most unlikable character award too. She seems oblivious that her need to know everything her daughter says or does and to hover around her every moment is clearly doing more damage than whatever the mother benefits from alleviating her own guilt and paranoia achieve.

I like how British shows unlike American TV shows that make as many episodes as their financers grant them, just make enough episodes to tell the story so we don't need a lot of filler story padding out the episodes.  With Thirteen's five episodes there is still a lot of stuff that isn't wrapped up but in this scenario if it happened in real life, that would be the case.",1475107200,,1895,4.566371681415929
8751854,3,B01BX2B3EK,"Initially I thought this was going to be a fictional reenactment of an actual event; not so, but a compilation of many abduction and imprisonment crimes with added writer's embellishment for entertainment.
For the most part a well written ""Stockholm Syndrome"" kidnapping tale. Acting by the abductee was exaggeratedly well done, but the parents, sister, friends, school administration and detectives were a little too made-for-TV dramatic to be believable. Romance & conflict between our detectives also not believable nor added anything to the seriousness of the kidnappings. The ending was the weakest - predictable, not believable and especially that the fugitive should roam so freely with so many resources. Missing, for the most part, were any scenes of her captivity. Finally, the brief CCTV footage shown would not have been kept that long.",1473984000,,848,5.383458646616542
