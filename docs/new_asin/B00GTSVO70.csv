8627411,4,B00GTSVO70,"After Hours Cinema has un-earthed a trio of 1970's/80's vintage sick & twisted 42nd Street grindhouse fare from period smut peddler Shaun Costello (AKA 'Jack Hammer') in this nice triple feature, 2 disk offering.

All three of the films are in color, full screen format, and have refreshingly clear picture quality - having been 'restored' for one's viewing pleasure.  There is the odd bit of typical 'grindhouse' scratchiness and such, but over-all the images are really good.

The 'films' themselves are all fully XXX hardcore and feature a stable of fairly well known 'period' porn actors and actresses - providing all of the usual carnal configurations that one might expect to see in such a product. Lotsa BJs and 69-ing and gynacological close-ups to be enjoyed, as well as, a bit of kinky BDSM action in each of the (relatively short/30 min.ish) flix.

The 'plots' of this trio of films are relatively thread-bare.  Two of them (""Slave of Pleasure"" and ""Prisoner of Pleasure"") have female 'abductions' at their roots with private eyes trying to get to the bottom of things.  The third: ""My Mistress Electra"" offers a little taste of femdom action to add variety to the mix.

I found the pacing and camera-work of the movies to be fairly engaging.  Costello seems to know how to shoot & edit his scenes so that they can deliver a fairly erotic viewing experience (albeit 'old school porn').  The women are generally attractive with big 80's hair (everywhere). The S/M scenes are light weight - mostly just hands tied up while being 'ravished' - the hottest bit ( I thot) was in ""Prisoner of Pleasure"" whence a 'punk' girl w/ (classic) electrical tape over her nipples is strung up and gets a pretty heavy duty spanking.  Long Jeanne Silver is in two of the films - she 'bares' her famous stump in one scene and looks like she's gonna 'use it' on another girl, but the action cuts away.  There is also a sorta perplexing 'duplication' about mid way thru ""Slave of Pleasure"" where a lengthy scene is inexplicably 'repeated'.  AHHH - the 'joys of grindhouse'!

The 2nd disk includes a hefty sampling of period 'trailers' for other ""Avon"" adult films - most of which are pretty 'bent' looking.  I don't think that any of the films included in these 'coming attractions' are currently available for purchase (yet!) - but there's hope!  Taking into account the 'dated' nature of this material - I found it to be a fun watch and would recommend it to other kink oriented porn addicts.",1441670400,13,2483,4.768691588785047
