3009884,1,B000XXWE1M,"From a review in IMDB: ""What a crock of crap, written by an old man to get a starlet naked, any starlet.""

My thoughts exactly.

The director is now long gone, but I've just watched this film so it's fresh to me. And rubbed me so very wrong.

Except for the lingering views of Ms Jacob's fine young breasts (in thoroughly gratuitous sex scenes), this film had absolutely no redeeming value whatever. I can accept attempts by a young director that fall short. Not so much when a ""master"" has nothing to say and then tries to impress us with his superior cleverness.

This film stinks so badly.

---------------

After writing the above, I looked to see what professional reviewers I respect thought of the film. Roger Ebert loved it as much as I did not. From his review: ""The last thing you want to do after a Kieslowski film is 'unravel' the plot. It can't be done."" Indeed.

Ebert didn't know the meaning of the shoe string or the flasher either. Just more ""genius"" we mere mortals are incapable of comprehending.

I stand by my opinion, except to add that the cinematography was quite good, if in a quite bad film.

Yes, I do feel a bit unsure swimming against the tide, railing against a film loved by so many. I'm not saying my judgment is right, just that it's mine, and your mileage may vary.

Let me add that this film is an example of my never going to reviews before watching a film (or reading a book, or hearing a CD): so that I can experience it with no preconceptions and better able to enjoy any surprises I might encounter. I forget how this film got in my public library account to be placed on hold. Maybe the director mentioned in a magazine, the article skimmed just enough to get me to add the film to my queue. Then, into the player, onto the screen, and for what it's worth, an independent judgment.

3009887,5,B000XXWE1M,The Double Life Of Veronique (1991) is an abstract and mysterious work in its imagery and intentions but manages to be pretty easy to follow as a story. Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the difining filmmakers in 80s and 90s art house cinema and sadly passed away in 1996 at age 54. He understood the limits of closure in cinema which I think is this work's most unique quality. The Three Colors Trilogy that would follow may be more accalimed and celebrated if not more fully realised but Veronique is still a personal favorite of mine from the period for its lavish colors and tour de force peformance from Irene Jacob. It was picked up by Miramax for an American release due to its success at Cannes and is an essential study for world cinema viewers to this day.,1470009600,,765,4.510791366906475

3009889,5,B000XXWE1M,"Krzysztof Kielowskis 1991 masterpiece The Double Life of Vronique (La Double vie de Vronique) is quite simply one of the most beautiful films ever made. This is evidenced on virtually every level  an extraordinarily empathetic and intensely moving central double performance from Irne Jacob, a superbly oneiric musical score from Zbigniew Preisner, gorgeous sepia-toned cinematography from Sawomir Idziak, and a deeply rigorous and profound screenplay worked out with Kielowski from Krzysztof Piesiewicz which manages to be as light and fanciful on the one hand as it is spiritual and metaphysical on the other. Kielowski is famous for making down-to-earth disparaging comments about the possible deeper meanings that lie within his films (For me, a bottle of milk is simply a bottle of milkNothing more.), but despite the modesty on display there is no doubt that he is always getting at something altogether deeper and he welcomes interpretation by people if it means they connect with his films  I don't film metaphors. People only read them as metaphors, which is very good. Thats what I want. The greatest beauty of The Double Life of Vronique lies in its all-embracing open-endedness for it can be appreciated as much emotionally as it can intellectually and evidently embodies the very essence of what drives Kielowski to make films in the first place  Thats why I do this [make films]  to make people experience something. It doesnt matter if they experience it intellectually or emotionally. You make films to give people something to transport them somewhere else and it doesnt matter if you transport them to a world of intuition or a world of the intellect.

Kielowskis world of intuition is expressed in this film by an uncountable number of binary parallels and opposites inherent in the central premise. A film in two halves, two girls are born on the same day in 1966, Weronika in Poland and Vronique in France. The first we see of them is in 1968 when Weronika is shown the stars in the sky (the first star of Christmas) by her off-screen mother and Vronique is shown a leaf (the first leaf of spring) by hers. 98 minutes later the film (at least in the European print) closes on Vronique sitting in her car, the sky reflected in the windscreen and her hand reaching out to touch a tree  everything begins and ends in nature both spiritual and earthly. By 1990 both mothers have died and Weronika/Vronique are being raised by their loving fathers, both of whom are artists. Weronikas father is a painter while Vroniques is a wood craftsman. This continues the binary relationship between heavenly/spiritual and earthly/practical. Weronika/Vronique both have heart conditions and both have aspirations to be singers. Both girls feel the presence of the other even though they are ignorant of each other and the feeling defies rational explanation  The film is about sensibility, presentiments and relationships, which are difficult to name, which are irrational (Kielowski). Weronika tells her father she feels she is not alone in the world and when she dies, Vronique immediately feels bereft, as if she has lost a kindred spirit. She has her parallel conversation with her father in which she says she has recently felt she was alone in the world. Not only that, but she feels as if she is being guided  I always sense what I have to do, she says. When Weronika ignores her heart condition and continues to sing, her eventual death leads to Vronique deciding immediately to give up her singing lessons. As Kielowski says, Vroniques constantly faced with the choice of whether or not to take the same road as the Polish Weronika, whether to give in to the artistic instinct and the tension intrinsic in art or to give in to love and all that involves. This, basically, is her choice. The film shows Weronika destroying herself for art while Vronique chooses the power of love, the spirit of the dead Weronika haunting her with reminders of what she has given up. The intuition felt between the women takes us to the heart of Kielowskis world wherein human life is defined by choices made, the choices not made living on and haunting us as unrealized potentialities. This works both ways in the film for Weronika gives up her boyfriend Antek (Jerzy Gudejko) and with it the possibility of love by pursuing her singing, while Vronique gives up her artistic gift for the more ephemeral pleasures of love in the shape of the puppeteer/childrens author Alexandre Fabbri (Philippe Volter). This is subtly underlined in the film by their first lovemaking taking place in a hotel in room 287, the very same room number where Antek was vainly waiting in a different hotel (in a different country!) for Weronika earlier in the film. The pleasures are ephemeral because Alexandre turns out to be an artist who sublimates everything into his own art including Vroniques own life. Like Weronika he chooses art over love and Veronique is doomed to suffering as a consequence.

The films emotional pull relies strongly on recurring imagery which continues the binary structure of the film. Two countries are made to look and feel the same by use of the same golden filter over Idziaks camera and the incessant use of Preisners music which Weronika/Vronique are involved with. Weronika dies while singing a piece by a fictional 18th century composer Van der Budenmajer (Preisner of course) while Vronique later teaches the same score to her students at school. The same eerie high flute accompanies strange lights and spiritual visitations while effective keyboard pieces are deployed, one either side of the death which splits the film in two. Theres a beautiful harpsichord (harp? celesta?) piece which plays during Weronikas conversation with her father and then on through her train ride to Krakw. Then theres a simple but moving piano accompaniment to Alexandres puppet show story of a dancer who lives in her box, dances, breaks her leg and dies only to be reborn as a butterfly as the music goes back to the Budenmajer piece that killed Weronika. Clearly the puppet show acts as a conduit wherein Vronique sees her double dying and being reborn as a spirit which will continue to haunt her (she thinks) in the shape of Alexandre who effects a meeting through poetic means of his own. For Vronique her meeting with Alexandre is her spiritual destination, the co-joining with her other half which she has long felt and long wanted to meet. But she is destined to be disillusioned

With repeated viewings, we recognize the immense sophistication of Kielowskis binary scheme more and more. Room 287 highlights the films central preoccupation with chance and this is carried on through the subtle use of objects  a lip chap-stick used by Weronika found later in Vroniques handbag, a clear rubber ball with stars inside which Weronika plays with, studying the world through it out of the train window and then banging it with joy on the floor at having won an audition. This is later found by Alexandre among Vroniques handbag contents which she has spilled across the bed. Theres a ring which Weronika uses to massage the bottom of her eyes which Veronique also has and uses the same way much later. Then theres the near-meeting of Weronika/Vronique in Krakw where Weronika sees Vronique taking photos from a tour bus, the negative of which turns up later in her handbag, the photo of her Polish twin clearly visable along with the ball as she rises to orgasm in her lovers arms. Most bizarrely of all theres a shoe lace sent by Alexandre which is meant by Kielowski to symbolize the life line on an EKG reading which measures Weronikas/Vroniques heart. When stretched taut it means death so that when Vronique measures the lace alongside her EKG read-out and pulls the lace tight we immediately connect it with the earlier scene of Weronika tripping herself over her laces while running through a puddle and of her finishing her singing audition by pulling the string tying a score together taut as she reaches the most strenuous part  the part at which she will later die in concert. We also connect it with the rope we see holding Weronikas coffin as it is lowered into the ground, the extraordinary shot rendered as a point of view shot upwards from Weronikas dead body.

Kielowski realizes that life is beyond easy encapsulation and along with repetitive imagery which we can easily decipher there are also enigmatic elements which defy categorization such as the repeated image of an old woman walking along the street. In Poland the woman is lumbered with shopping and Weronika throws open the window, offering to help. In France Vronique relates her dream to her father of seeing an old woman walking up a road between trees towards a red-bricked church, but then we see her looking out of the window of her classroom where her kids are practicing Budenmajer and see the old woman, but with no shopping and no church. Actually we see the red bricked church earlier as Weronika (not Vronique) looks through her ball, the image upside down in a staggeringly beautiful poetic image. These images are as enigmatic as the ones of the old lady trying to put a bottle into a bottle bank in each of the Three Colors films. Perhaps the purpose is simply to say something about the difference in temperament between Weronika and Vronique. Weronika is cheerful, effervescent, restless, and childlike (especially as dubbed by Anna Gornostaj) and her offer of help to the old woman expresses her youthful high spirits and genuine good nature. Vronique is much more introspective, haunted by the loss of her mysterious other half as shown in the two love making scenes which should be times of joy, but which are actually times of anguish, the first coinciding with Weronikas burial and the second with the discovery of the photo of Weronika by Alexandre. Love making is about two people uniting, but here Vronique is alone and vulnerable in both cases. Her image out of the window (its not certain it is out of the window for the texture of the image has a disconnected daydream quality) is of an old woman walking, but Vronique does nothing except look and contemplate. Enigma also continues over the mysterious stern woman with hat who looks at Weronika scowling at the fact that she has won the singing audition, and then reappears later in the Gare St. Lazare in Paris staring at Vronique twice (once standing and then later sitting) as she tries to find the caf where Alexandre hopefully is waiting for her.

Engima and fantasy hover most obviously over the way Alexandre engineers Vroniques tryst with him, and is the point at which skeptics may well walk away from the film. A heavy-breathing phone call and then the Budenmajer music (how does he know her phone number? How does he know the significance of the Budenmajer?) is followed by Vronique getting a shoe lace in the mail (What is the possibility she would immediately link the lace with a short story he has written?), strong flickering light refracted into her face as she wakes up in her room which suggests the butterfly of the short story his puppet play was about as well as of course the spirit of Weronika (But how could he know that?), and then the receipt of a tape with ambient noise of (it turns out) Paris Gare St. Lazare where Vronique eventually goes and discovers him having waited over 48 hours sitting in a caf. All of this is very far-fetched and we only have two threads to really guide us  Vroniques belief that she is fulfilling her spiritual destiny, that Alexandre is her soul partner whom she has been yearning for all her life and then Alexandres machinations as over-arching artist creator. This is where intuition gives way to intellect and it becomes clear that what Kielowski has given here is as intensely metaphysical as it is whimsically fanciful.

In the caf it emerges that Alexandre has gone to great trouble to lure Vronique out in order to prove a theorem so that he can write a book about it. He proves to himself that it is possible to write a story based on a female character meeting her destiny through intuition alone. Then at the very end of the film Alexandre is shown making two puppets in the image of Vronique and he makes clear to her that he is going to use her life story not only in a book, but in a puppet play as well. The puppet play is to be entitled The Double Life of, the name not being decided yet, but of course we and Vronique know. I would suggest that both the book and the puppet play are metaphors for the film we are watching and that Alexandre is a doppelgnger for the films artistic creator, Kielowski himself. This makes the whole film a piece of meta-fiction in which the artist manipulates absolutely everything we see to depict in binary terms his own universe which is one based on chance, choices made and choices ignored and the inter-relationship between the two. Most obviously, this explains the films emphasis on each element of the film-making process and the heightened artificiality inherent in that. The film looks artificial (the gold lens filter coating each frame in false luminance constantly tells us we are watching a film), sounds artificial (note especially the way Budenmajers/Preisners concert piece is electronically distorted as the soprano voice soars upwards to the conductors visable amazement just before Weronikas collapse) and feels artificial. The story is outwardly preposterous and the careful binary presentation of two worlds, two countries, two people, suggests the creators hands are forever hovering over events, guiding, manipulating and defining both the story and us in the audience. Most obvious here is the puppet show which is in effect a film-within-a-film as Alexandre presents his story which he (being Kielowski himself) deliberately makes a metaphor for Vroniques own life experience. Kielowski has said it was very important for him that the puppeteers hands remain visable throughout and Bruno Schwarz was chosen because he is one of the few puppeteers who believe in not hiding his hands. This insistence on the visability of hands underlines Kielowskis intention to present his film as if manipulated by a higher force. The identity of this higher force is clearly shown by the films later scene in his studio where Alexandre wraps Vronique from behind, playing one of his Vronique dolls in front of her (hands clearly visable) as the second Vronique (Weronika of course) lies dead on the table.

On an even larger scale of course this films over-arching artist creator is none other than God Himself, and that is probably the level on which those with Faith will read it. Certainly the opening and closing images of sky (stars) and nature (leaves/trees) frame a universe arranged in binary order and there are images and scenes which can be linked with religion. The quick camera movement over the heads of members of the audience after Weronikas collapse strongly suggest her spirit taking flight having been released from the body that once contained it. The words of Budenmajers orchestral setting are taken from Dantes Divine Comedy (Paradiso, II, 1-9). Vronique is visited by Weronikas spirit not only in the music, but also in poetic images, for example a ghost-like image of Weronikas head singing and collapsing at the end of Alexandres phone call. The butterfly rising from the dead puppet could be an angel, perhaps Vroniques guardian angel who tells her what [she has] to do. Also there are references to churches and the image of Krakw cathedral. We should be careful though not to be too literal as an ambiguous image near the films beginning demonstrates. A giant statue is dragged by a truck, the figure standing with one arm raised as if to bless. Is this image Marx or Jesus? Poland being a Communist as well as Catholic country, it could be both as the backlighting deliberately makes it hard for us to tell. Kielowski is actually on record as being agnostic and tempting as it is to read the films spiritualism religiously, we should remember that spiritualism doesnt have to be connected with God, or a belief in God. New Age spiritualism separates one from the other and the film can be read both ways, the over-arching artistic creator finally being unquantifiable and unknowable. This is finally Kielowskis point I guess. He doesnt want to get specific. More simply he just wants to approach that inner spiritual life that lays inside all of us whether we have Faith or not. He says, The realm of superstitions, fortune telling, intuition, dreams, all this is the inner life of a human being, and all this is the hardest thing to film. Even though I know that it cant be filmed however hard I try, the simple fact is that Im taking this direction to get as close to this as my skill allows[the] goal is to capture what lies within us, but theres no way of filming it. You can only get nearer to it.

Theres no question in my mind that Kielowski is one of the greatest film directors of the last 30 years or so and The Double Life of Vronique is one of his most outstanding achievements. Set squarely in two countries, it marks the transition in his career from Polish film maker to international director. Some have said he betrays his roots here, but I think the films many connections with his past work disprove this. The idea of a character defining his/her life by making a choice with the possible outcomes lingering on and affecting this choice was first used in Blind Chance (1982), while the idea of the dead affecting the lives of the living from beyond the grave had been announced in No End (1984). That was the film which marked the first collaboration between Kielowski, Piesiewicz and Preisner, and Kielowskis focus on metaphysical matters from that time on in Dekalog (1988) and in the Three Colors Trilogy (1993-94) is largely put down to this three-way partnership, especially (I would say) Piesiewicz who was the originator of all these projects. The Double Life of Vronique emanated out of an episode of Dekalog 9 which briefly features an outstanding girl soprano who has to give up her career because of her heart condition. On Dekalog it was agreed between Kielowski and Piesiewicz to cut out anything about the internal politics of Poland in view of the series being set for international distribution. The Double Life of Vronique continues the stress on metaphysics over politics, though there is still a Solidarity demonstration scene which Weronika perhaps pointedly walks away from, and the scene gets its binary reflection in the exploding car scene outside the caf in the Gare St. Lazare, without which Vronique certainly would never have found Alexandre who had captured the sound of the explosion on the audio tape sent to her. That this film is an extraordinarily addictive and hypnotic experience owes a lot to all the various elements of the film-making process. Clearly Kielowski, Piesiewicz and Preisner all excel themselves as they did in everything from No End right through to the directors unfortunate early death, but I want to end with Irne Jacob. Present in every scene and the luminous light of the whole film, it would be impossible to imagine this film without her. She renders the two roles with such breathtaking range and skill. The childlike innocent Weronika is perfectly contrasted with her haunted introspective Vronique and we see the added load on her character with such clarity. Just to choose one example, the way she reacts at the end to the realization that Alexandre is using her story for his puppet show is so convincing. In her eyes we see very clearly the disillusionment and the pain that she is going through. With a performance less nuanced than hers, this film would have fallen as flat as a pancake. As it is the film is a beautiful miracle.

NB: I am reviewing a Tartan video tape which I transcribed to DVD by myself. It features the American ending which Miramaxs Harvey Weinstein insisted on. Apparently the original ending was deemed unclear, the fact that the guy cutting wood is Vroniques father and that she has driven home are left opaque for American viewers. Kielowski was obliged to shoot three extra shots  of the father coming out, a long shot of Vronique getting out of the car and running to him, and then the final image of the two hugging shot from inside the house, actually with a mirror to one side so that we see two couples hugging. Kielowski has gone public saying he doesnt object to this new ending so we also shouldnt object I suppose. But I prefer the ending with the sky and the tree - doubling with the films very opening images it just makes so much more sense. It looks like the Criterion DVD/Blu-ray version is the one to get. That features the original ending with the American one as an option. It also features three short films (Factory [1970], Hospital [1976], Railway Station [1980]) and a commentary by Annette Insdorf, author of the book Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kielowski. I cant comment on the Artificial Eye release.",1462838400,,21073,4.840221914008322

3009922,5,B000XXWE1M,"I've been a fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski for a while now without having really seen many of his films.  In fact, I'd seen a total of four before sitting down to watch `The Double Life of Veronique' and I was still utterly spellbound by the very mention of his name.  I remember quite vividly the first time I saw `No End' and it was like the end all for me.  There was no coming back from that.  Kieslowski became one of my favorite filmmakers with just a single film.  But with each film I do see my view of his craft is only enriched because each film is THAT good.

`The Double Life of Veronique' is, at the moment, my favorite.

First of all, the film is a technical marvel.  From the splendid performances (Irene Jacob is a revelation in dual roles that complete one another spectacularly) to the rich set pieces and the colorful use of framing each scene to the glorious operatic score and the languid way in which the film progresses forward, `The Double Life of Veronique' is one of those films you WANT to look at.  The film is gorgeous.  More than that though, the film says something so compelling and so profound about the way we see life in general and I can't help but continue to go back to this film as a tent pole of sorts; a film that defines what film should be about.

Basically, the story told is of two woman who share a similar identity, not to mention the same appearance.  Weronika is a Polish singer with a heart condition.  Veronique is a French music teacher who also suffers from a heart condition.  When Weronika dies, Veronique feels it in her soul, but it is a feeling she cannot explain.  Her life takes on a different shape, a different meaning, and while she tries to move forward she can't help but feel in the back of her mind and in the pit of her soul that something is different.  The connection between the women is never explained and the hinting of a parallel life shared between two souls is given brief light as Veronique mentions always feeling that there was another part of her somewhere, that she is not alone in the world.

What is so wonderful about this prose and the way that Kieslowski manages to maintain the ambiguity within the film's climax is that it allows the audience to explore a part of themselves they may normally leave untapped.  The spiritual aspects of the film are highlighted by the way in which these two lives are interwoven and the beautiful cinematography envelopes each scene in this mysterious light that personifies the themes being broached here.

The idea of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu has been flirted with in the past and will continue to be, but I found the way that `The Double Life of Veronique' attempts to convey that very same feeling without being obvious or literal in the process to be the most effective.  Maybe spiritualists believe in the afterlife and or the existence of a parallel spirit or dimension or alternate self and the reincarnation belief is one that has been around for ages.  While never specifically mentioning any of the above, `The Double Life of Veronique' raises awareness to the possibility that we are not alone and no matter what medium you believe to be responsible for that duality it becomes apparent that Krzysztof's voice is one worth listening to.",1345161600,,3263,4.562607204116638

There is repeatedly a kind of mystification which seems inappropriate to me.
If there is no obvious story or plot, this need not be a problem; but this movie lacks authenticity, if you ask me. The movie is phantasy/imagination-driven, psychologically it is not realistic or mature; and I do not sense true inspiration or depth.

Alienation is an important theme in this movie, but it is not really solved or confronted.
Sex and intimacy is no solution.
Beauty for beauty's sake is no solution.
An art-movie without depth or primary-authentic inspiration is also no solution either.

3009924,5,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life of Veronique (1991)
Drama, Fantasy, Music, 98 minutes, French and Polish Language
Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski
Starring Irene Jacob and Philippe Volter

The Double Life of Veronique sparks all kinds of thoughts, makes me cry, and leaves me feeling like I entered another world.

The film is probably the most beautiful I have ever seen. The color palette is rich and places an emphasis on reds, greens and yellows. There are many instances of images viewed through things which distort reality: a clear plastic ball, mirrors, windows, reflections in glass and also a magnifying glass.

Music is a huge part of the experience, whether it's happening in the story or part of the soundtrack.

The first 30 minutes of the story concerns Weronika. She is Polish and a gifted singer. Weronika is so in tune with life that it's painful. When she sings, there is pure joy visible on her face. She ignores outside distractions such as pouring rain because she's so caught up in the moment. She makes love the same way.

***Spoiler Alert***

Unfortunately, Weronika has a heart problem and drops dead while performing at a recital.

The film switches locations and we find ourselves in France with Veronique. She appears identical to Weronika and both women are played by Irene Jacob. Veronique seems to sense Weronika's death, although she can't pinpoint why she is feeling a sense of loss.

This is a film about connections and feelings. Are we alone in the world or are there people somewhere just like us? Do we share any kind of connection? Is any of this controlled by some higher power, or are events simply random? The ""coincidences"" in this film are too frequent for everything to be random, aren't they? Room 287, a plastic ball, a ring, a shoestring, loving fathers and absent mothers, and probably a few things that I completely missed.

Kieslowski doesn't tell us what any of this means. We don't know whether the two women are related or twins separated at birth. It doesn't really matter why any of this happens. The film is intended to make us think and feel, and it succeeds very well.

I often wonder whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet was thinking of Veronique when he created Amelie. Although one is completely serious and one is a comedy, both contain elaborate scenes in which one character encourages another to seek them out. France features in both films and the color palette's are similar.

I can't make a sweeping recommendation. This is the kind of film for people who like to contemplate the meaning of life and their own existence. The narrative meanders along and there are no clear answers or startling resolutions to the story. It just is.",1330473600,,2675,4.831509846827133

3009926,5,B000XXWE1M,"Kieslowski's The Double Life of Veronique is a unique film that's quite difficult to explain if you haven't see it. The story follows two women: polish singer Weronika and french teacher Veronique. While both don't know about the existence of the other, they share a mystical connection that's reinforced by the use of colors, filters and music. Both women are played by Irene Jacob which is superb in the dual role. Contrary of what the title suggests, this is not a mystery thriller about the women finding each other. No, this film is about loss, liberty, freedom, duality, love, destiny and more. Kieslowski shows us a surreal connection that are reinforced by beautiful shots. This film is more about feeling than understanding. When you watch it, you experience a diverse of emotions even if you don't quite understand what's going on. Never has been a film like this one before or after and only reinforces the fact that Kieslowski was truly a unique director. Veronique is a beautiful, superb film. A classic.

3009929,5,B000XXWE1M,"Vibrant, colorful, symbiotic and ambiguous, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a wonderful arthouse film that continues to resonate strongly 20-years later and a highlight in the career of Polish director and screenwriter Krzysztof Kie'lowski's cinema oeuvre.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a 1991 French and Polish film and a pre-cursor to Kieslowski's color trilogy (""Three Colors: Blue, Red and White) and known for the TV mini-series ""The Decalogue"" which captured audiences for its artistic style, considering it was a TV mini-series, preceded by three more Kieslowski films that received rave reviews in 1988, ""A Short Film About Love"",  ""A Shot Film About Killing"" and in 1981 for ""Blind Chance"".

The film won ""Best Actress"", ""FIPRESCI Prize"" and ""Prize of the Ecumenical Jury"" at the Cannes International Film Festival and was also nominated for a Golden Palm Award.  Also winning an award for ""Best Music"" by the Los Angeles Film Critics"" and ""Best Foreign Language Film"" by the National Society of Film Critics Awards.

While the film was praised for its symbolic and artistic quality, for the US release, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax requested an alternate ending and thus the US version of the film had an extra four scenes at the end.

But what ""The Double Life of Veronique"" would feature is a concept of doppelgangers, a fantasy element that is not explained but it is part of the film.  But what is amazing about the film is its cinematography as it uses color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere where greens, yellows, oranges, reds and blacks are featured strongly throughout the film.  A style which cinematographer Slawomir Idziak would experiment on ""The Decalogue"" and would become used in this film and used heavily in Kieslowski's ""Color"" trilogy.

VIDEO:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is presented in 1:66:1 and looks magnificent on Blu-ray.  Detail is much more evident as you can see the cracks of the walls to the skin bumps on Irene Jacob's naked skin.  The colors also pop with no sight of banding.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep. As mentioned earlier, the color filters and what was accomplished by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak is quite amazing.  The filters create an ethereal dreamlike look for the film and if you thought the film looked great on DVD, on Blu-ray, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" looks spectacular.

On 4:3 televisions, the images will appear letterboxed.  On standard and widescreen televisions, black bars may also be visible on the left and right to maintain the proper screen format.

According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer was created using a 35mm negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is presented in stereo.  Dialogue and music can be heard clearly! The score by Zbigniew Preisner is wonderful and comes alive through the lossless stereo track but if anything captured me was hearing the operatic voice (not sure if that was truly Irene Jacob's voice but it was divine!).

According to the Criterion Collection, the stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35-mm magnetic tracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools D.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is quite an intriguing film.  Many critics and viewers have various interpretations of the film... From the two women symbolizing their countries, the women symbolizing the life of Kie'lowski and others feeling it deals with the doppelganger mythology and more.

There is an ambiguity that Kie'lowski knew that people who watched the film, would experience and interpret it differently.  And it's what he wanted to do as a filmmaker.  In fact, knowing that this film would be showing in various theaters, his goal was to slightly change the film for each theater,  ""The Double Life of Veronique"" would be a different experience for a viewer, with some scenes running shorter or longer, ending would be happy or sad but in the end, they ran out of time and were only able to create two versions, with the second version being the US release with a few scenes added to the request made by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein.

There is no doubt that this is one of those films that arthouse fans love for its cinematic creativity.  The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is magnificent.  The use of the filters in Kie'lowski's words, ""to create a beautiful world, more than it is"".  But for others, the film may be too ambiguous for their tastes.  But it is what made Kie'lowski's work so unique and untethered.  Although he worked in co-productions, his films were his own.  He made the call, he made the cuts and the integrity of the film of what he wanted remained intact.

But there are scenes that are symbolic, there are scenes which one must be focused on too pickup the various clues that Kie'lowski leaves with the viewers.  From Weronika pulling on a shoestring which resembles an EKG monitor and seeing the string snap off.  There is a scene in Veronique's storyline in which her small crystal ball shows an image of buildings which were the buildings that Weronika's father was drawing, and a small ball that Weronika also carries.  There is a scene where Weronika looks at her photo after making love and seeing the opposite with Veronique.

The film showcases this mysterious connection but it doesn't focus on it.  While many Hollywood films on the mystical are treated with storylines answering questions of ""why is it possible?"", Kie'lowski's film answers back with a ""why should I answer that?"".

In many ways, the film can be seen like poetry, like a painting.  The film relies on ambiance and mood for narrative, in fact Weronika/Veronique's dialogue is quite minimalistic, as the film is ethereal and allows the viewer to come up with their own answers to what the film may be about.

I've met people who felt that Weronika succumbs to the doppelganger effect (a myth which is about a person who comes across their exact self, their doppelganger, the result is that they will die).  But there are those who go deeper into the storyline and feel that ""The Double Life of Veronique"" examines humanity and possibly may symbolize countries.  If both countries have a connection and are very much alike, do they have free will or is someone higher pulling their strings. Others have felt there was a religious connection (although God or religion is not mentioned in the film), I have read those who felt there was a Christian-link to the film when it comes to spirituality.

Some may feel there is a symbolism with a political nature due to Kieslowski's past films, while others feel the film is about something deeper.  Nevertheless, this is where the efficacy of the film works, with the fact that people have their own interpretation of what the film is about and what they imagine the film to be.

This was Kieslowski's style, to never discuss what he was trying to accomplish with the film, to let the viewers have their say on how a film meant to them.

For me, I have watched this film several times and each time, I manage to pick up on things that I didn't see previously.  In fact, this is a film that does require multiple viewings, not for the sake of understanding the story but as I mentioned before, it's like a painting.  It has simplicity, but it can also be interpreted as complex.  Kie'lowski is the creator, does his past and what he had created in his past films or documentary work have something to say about his work of art?  What are the symbolic meanings of the objects of the film?  These questions is what makes the film so intriguing that you want to watch it again.

As for the acting, the acting was wonderful.  Irene Jacob did a fantastic job in playing the role of two women.  She is able to embody the emotions felt by both women, from happiness, sadness and it looks natural and believable.  And I will say that if it that is Jacob's voice during those operatic scenes, my respect for her as a multi-talented actress has increased and found her performance to be ingratiating.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""The Double Life of Veronique"", let me first say that the 2006 DVD release from The Criterion Collection was magnificent.  And with the 2010 Blu-ray release in Europe ala Artificial Eye, there was no doubt in my mind that this title would receive a Blu-ray release courtesy of Criterion.  The 2011 Blu-ray looks absolutely beautiful in HD and of course, with the ability to go to index for the commentary quite easily is a plus.  But it is important for me to say that the original 2006 DVD release does have more content (in the booklet) and of course, the DVD release had an awesome package.

So, the big question for those who own the previous 2006 DVD release is if it's worth owning on Blu-ray.  The answer is yes if you want the improved picture quality and lossless stereo track.  But if you don't have a 1080p HD TV or a proper home theater setup for lossless audio, then it's a moot point, there is no need to upgrade.  Otherwise, if you do have the proper home theater setup, then yes because the film looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray,  The details of the film are much more evident, every crack on the walls can be seen, even the skin bumps on actress Irene Jacob can be seen very clearly.

Overall, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a magnificent film from director Krzysztof Kie'lowski and the Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection is wonderful.  I will say that the original 2006 DVD had a wonderful package presentation and the addition of more content in the booklet made it a perfect release and if you own that DVD release, I highly recommend on keeping it.  But for those who don't own the film or those wanting to upgrade to Blu-ray, especially for those who are used to watching arthouse films, especially Kie'lowski films, will find ""The Double Life of Veronique"" to be a release worth owning especially as it is a film that requires multiple viewing.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a beautiful film!

3009931,5,B000XXWE1M,"I've read through most of the reviews on this page. The majority of the Amazon reviewers pretty much gave a detailed and thorough summary and review of ""The Double Life of Veronique"", so I don't need to be redundant or rehash what these reviewers have written. The main reason why I'm writing is because I feel that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the most important, talented, deep, creative, artistic, soul-searching director geniuses of all time. If I had to travel back in time, I would want to meet and have conversations with Krzysztof Kieslowski, President Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, etc. Kieslowski's films have made a major impact on my life. His films have always brought great comfort to me because he felt things so deeply and saw symbolism in a lot of things like I do. In my humble opinion, the best films in the world are the kinds that make you feel deeply emotional from beginning to end and that make you think days, weeks, months, years after the movie ends. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" was released in the U.S. in late 1991 when I was a freshman at an undergraduate university. I have seen artistic and thought-provoking films such as the films I saw when I took a Soviet Cinema class in college and viewed movies such as Mikhail Kalatozov's ""The Cranes are Flying"", Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"", ""Stalker"", and ""Andrei Rublev"", Sergei Eisentein's ""Battleship Potemkin"", and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"". From that Soviet Cinema class, my favorite was Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"". Parajanov's film was an extraordinarily different and artistic cinematic experience. You have to feel, think, and see the symbolism in Parajanov's films. And I once had a boyfriend who said he didn't get it and said he was bored with ""The Color of Pomegranates"", even though I was the opposite, and thought it was a surreal experience to watch the film. You can't have a short attention span when you watch films like this. I like films that have symbolism and that make you pay attention to details from beginning to end. And you need to pay attention from beginning to end with Krzysztof Kieslowski's films. Kieslowski is my favorite director of all time because he uses every element to make you feel haunting, deep, intense emotions. I've never seen a director incorporate light, symbolism, music, objects like he does. I really do believe that this man is the most clever director. Everything means something when you watch his films. My sister and I love watching his work. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" impacted me so much that I bought the star rubber ball that Irene Jacob uses in the film when I was in college. Who knew that you can view the world in a different way with a star rubber ball? Who knew that Veronique would see the same buildings that Weronika saw through her star rubber ball? I can't repeat how genius Kieslowski was! It's like he thought about every scene and every prop and object he used, yet it looks so effortless at the same time. I've never seen a director put so much thought into things yet made it look so easy and like it was meant to be. After watching ""The Double of Veronique"" or any of Kieslowski's films, you'll never look at children's books, shoelaces, cigar boxes, cassette tapes, puppets, ring, old people walking on the street carrying bags or recycling stuff, flashes of light, or music in the same way. For anyone who has the Zodiac sign of the Gemini like me, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" holds special meaning. I relate to both the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique. There's a weak, fragile side to me and a stronger side to me. Right now, I'm going through some health problems, so I'm experiencing the Polish Weronika side now. Weird as it sounds, I've always felt that there was somebody else, another part of me, that was stronger and had more luck health-wise on the other side of this Earth. Even though it's tragic what happened to Weronika, her life being cut short with her heart problems, the other ""twin"", Veronique goes to check her heart problems in the Cardiology Department. While Weronika works hard and realizes she is suffering from heart problems she continues to sing until she dies unexpectedly while Veronique seems to sense something and uses caution and says she no longer wants to sing. The scene where Veronique stretches the shoelace on top of her ECG/EKG (heart rate) page was genius. That one scene was ""symbolic"" of the tie she had with Weronika - Weronika's heart failed, while Veronique's didn't. Some people have luck on their side, and some people don't. And this film perfectly illustrates that. This film provides much comfort to me because it's like Kieslowski is telling us that we all are going to die whether young or old. We see the young Weronika die, and we see the old person walking on the street (In my opinion, Kieslowski's awareness of death approaching). In summary, we need to come to terms with the luck of the draw and the fate that has been handed to us. And that even though you have died (the Polish Weronika), a part of you (the French Veronique) lives on and the world goes on. It's because of Kieslowski that I have come to terms with some of the bad luck that happened to me at a young age which affected my health. Kieslowski's films have taught me to learn to have more peace in my life and to not fear the bad things in life. Kieslowski's films have truly taught me to not fear death and mortality. Yes, that's how amazing and important Krzysztof Kieslowski was. Irene Jacob does an excellent job in this film playing the dual roles. And Zbigniew Preisner does an amazing job with the music as usual. I love how Kieslowski has worked with Irene Jacob and Zbigniew Preisner in more than film. It shows how loyal and trusting he was. I truly believe this world would be a much better place if more people watched Kieslowski's ""Three Colors Trilogy"", ""The Decalogue"" series, and ""The Double Life of Veronique"". I can't repeat enough how genius and awesome Kiewslowski was! If my memory is correct, when I saw the movie ""Blue"", Juliette Binoche's character moves out of the house, and carries a box that is holding the blue glass ceiling fixture from her daughter's room, and the box says ""Blanco"", meaning the color ""White"", which was the next film in the trilogy. In the movie ""Red"", the old, retired judge lives alone and made the wrong romantic choice when he was younger. The young judge in the movie is going on the same path as the old judge by falling for the wrong woman and fate intervenes and he is with the right woman, Irene Jacob. The old, retired judge then finds some peace seeing the young judge with the right woman. In a way, you can find parallels in ""Red"" and ""The Double Life of Veronique"". Life didn't turn out perfect for Weronika or the old, retired judge, but there is peace found when better luck and better choices are made from Veronique and the young judge's side. In a way, you feel complete when you watch Kieslowski's films. He shows you what it's like on both sides of the spectrum. He shows you what it looks like to take one path and what it looks like to take the other path. Anyways, I strongly and highly recommend ""The Double Life of Veronique"" and any film that Krzysztof Kieslowski has ever made. I really mean it when I say that you're really missing out if you haven't watched or bought one Krzysztof Kieslowski film. I have truly become a better human being knowing that Kieslowski had true empathy and understanding about humanity and the true, deep, important meaning of life. For instance in ""Red"", the young, Irene Jacob, works in the end harmoniously with the old, Jean-Louis Trintignant. You see Irene Jacob help an old person recycle in ""Red"". In a way, Kieslowski was sending the message that both the old and the young can help and learn from each other. And I feel that many people will truly become enlightened human beings after watching any of Kieslowski's films.",1290816000,,8033,4.693834160170092
3009932,5,B000XXWE1M,"Two identical women in two different countries, living lives that mirror one another. When one dies, what is left?

Krzysztof Kieslowski produced one of his finest films is ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (""La Double vie de Vronique""). It's not just a philosophical, artistic film, but a subtle and unique tale full of Kieslowski's exquisitely detailed direction. And of course, it gives Irne Jacob a chance to shine in her most challenging role.

There are two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique (both played by Irne Jacob). They have never met, never spoken, and do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer.

What is more, each has the strange feeling that she is, somehow, not alone in the world. One night, Weronika dies onstage while singing. Suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling, and stops taking her lessons. Weronika has died, but she still lives. Soon she begins to explore, searching for the truth about her double life, and a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that just begs to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? About fate? Sacrifice? Love? One woman's soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols and metaphors can be unwound any which way, and in the end they all work.

Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art. He dots ""Double Life"" with plenty of little hints about the inner states of the characters. The stars and leaves, for example, hint at the personalities of Weronika and Veronique -- one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.

At times this film seems like a love letter on film to Irne Jacob. Not only is she followed constantly by the camera, but her character is difficult but rewarding. Jacob shines without really seeming to, with the emotion and wonder of a small child in an adult body. Philippe Volter's aura of mystery adds to his excellent acting in his too-brief scenes. Unfortunately, few of the other characters are given much dimension -- the whole focus is on Weronika and Veronique.

Like other Criterion blu-ray releases, this has the same sort of extras -- audio commentary, three short documentary films, a short film by Kieslowski's mentor, a documentary with behind-the-scemes stuff and interview, another documentary examining Kieslowski's career, an interview with Jacob, and some essays. Be informed: the blu-ray will include FEWER essays than the regular DVD booklet.

This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpret it as you will, but it's undeniable that Kieslowski's ""Double Life of Veronique"" is exquisite.",1289865600,,3218,5.058490566037736

Some reviewers see the film as an allegory of Poland's relationship to Western Europe; an interesting interpretation although it does not seem Kieslowski had this directly in mind.

3009934,5,B000XXWE1M,"Irene Jacob is exceptionally captivating playing the dual role of Veronika, an aspiring Polish soprano, and Veronique, a French music teacher. The Double Life of Veronique is a highly cerebral story of two people who feel a profound connection with someone they do not know and have never met. We first meet Veronika in Poland: singing in a choir, meeting a lover, auditioning. She wakes up one evening from a strange dream, gasping, and tells her father that she believes she is not alone. She begins to suffer bouts of breathlessness. During her debut performance, she collapses on stage. We then meet Veronique in Paris: teaching music to young students, watching a puppet show, visiting her father at his country estate. When Veronique begins to receive mysterious packages from an unknown admirer, she believes that she is deeply in love, and that the source is the answer that would fill the inexplicable and sudden void in her life. However, as with life, illusion may be more intriguing, but proves fleeting. What remains is a profound revelation that leads her to an inevitable conclusion and closure.

The Double Life of Veronique is a highly provocative film that examines a soul's search for identity and connection. Kieslowski uses a sepia overlay on the film to create a monochromatic, almost ethereal atmosphere. The suffusive darkness achieved by this technique is a manifestation of the mystical and dreamlike elements of the story (note the similar effect achieved in Agnieszka Holland's Olivier, Olivier). As in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, the visual otherworldliness of the film is a representation of the exploration of the subconscious. Note the elements of fairy tales and vivid dreams in the film. The unfolding of the story is elliptical and obscure, as if the protagonist is reluctantly waking from a sweet, intangible dream. In fact, she is.",1262736000,,1868,5.1245901639344265
3009935,4,B000XXWE1M,"Throughout his career director Krsysztof Kieslowski worked as a documentary film maker, before doing his doing his most memorable works on film.

His movies offer recurring themes such as coincidences, reverbation, connection, and even parallel lives, and deliver a compelling fly on the wall look at human existence. With Veronique and his famous Blue, White and Red Trilogy, he has crafted some of the most visually memorable movies you will see.  In fact, I saw this movie after seeing it recommended on Roger Ebert's website.

It is a simple truth, universally acknowledged that there is little in the world more beautiful and affecting than a beautiful woman in her pristine prime.  So it is with Veronique affectingly portrayed by Irene Jacob.

Not only do see her in wonder, in bemusement, and nude and being made love to, like the camera in love with it's object, it's like we step into that life and see the things we would not normally see with an all seeing eye. This is how this movie excels as a work of art.  We get to know who she is by how she is.

The only weakness I find is with the story and the characterisation.  While Irene Jacob is a compelling presence, the other characters and the story do not develop particularly well.

A little disturbing is the introduction of the puppeteer, a somewhat shadowy and mysterious character, with somewhat of a stalker like obsession with French Veronique.  He sends a shoelace through the mail.
Does he represent some sort of all knowing intelligence, and are his intentions towards her actually good?  The sequence where he makes love to her while she is sad, could be interpreted a number of ways.

I find Irene Jacob fascinating, and she did another movie with Kiezlowski called Red.  I consider that a much better movie, it tells a story, and draws parallels between the old judge and the young man, and I would call Red a masterful work. Red is part of a trilogy, yet it is a stand alone movie. It also garnered three Oscar nominations.  Unfortunately, Red proved to be his last movie.

Starring Irene Jacob, whose acting is as superb as her beauty, the film is a complex metaphysical examination of twin souls briefly touching then parting and leaving only question marks. Jacob plays both roles, and Kieslowski moves at will between their two lives, sometimes with few visual clues. It may take several viewings to get their lives straight, but it is worth it. Long out of print, this film eluded me for about five years before I found a VHS tape, which I watched many times before it was released on DVD. If you like great filmmaking and don't mind subtitles, I highly recommend this film as I do Kieslowski's other masterpieces, the trilogy Blue, White, and Red, which are absolutely incredible films. (Jacob also stars in Red -- in my opinion the best of these three great films.) Though from Poland, Kieslowski made all of these films in French.

Such a meeting would pose some fascinating questions, I think. And the possibility of such a meeting made me recall two wonderful pieces of fiction by the master Argentinean poet/philosopher/writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986). In two of his short stories such meetings actually do occur; ""The Other"" (from ""The Book of Sand"" - 1975) and ""August 25, 1983"" (from ""Shakespeare's Memory"" - 1983).

3009939,4,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life Of Vronique (La Double Vie De Vronique) is the 1991 French-Polish film by Krzysztof Kieslowski, written by himself and Krzysztof Piesiewicz that was the presage for the greatness of the Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, and Red), and was an international sensation at both the Cannes and New York film festivals, for here is where the gilt-hazed camera work of Slawomir Idziak, the music of Zbigniew Preisner (although slyly credited to the fictional Van den Budenmayer in the film- a running joke within Kieslowski's later works), and Kieslowski's own vision first touched greatness- even if it is a conditional greatness, more of sensuality than sense. The film has been rhapsodized by international film critics as Kieslowski's `coming out' film, but one can see it is clearly a bridge between the direction he was headed with his tv series The Decalogue, and where he ended up in the Trilogy.
  The film is not linear, which is the first thing that separates it from the typical Hollywood, and even contemporary European, films, but there is a cloying coyness to the film's reliance on synchronicities and contrivances that is more pronounced than in the Trilogy, where the errors Kieslowski made here were modulated. A film, or any work of art, that has a number of interpretations is exciting, but one with unlimited interpretations is a cheat, and reeks of narrative laziness. The Double Life Of Vronique falls just short of going too far, but the relentless scenes of cogitation for the sake of cogitation- and revealing lead actress Irne Jacob's lovely face and body, border on the obsessive; which would not be a bad thing, considering a good portion of the film's tale is on that topic, but the plain fact is that there is nothing new brought to the table on said topic.
  Many critics have read so much nonsense into the film- such as the early death of Weronika absurdly representing Poland's absorption into the Soviet Bloc- in this most apolitical of films, that such readings only highlight the film's greatest failure- a lack of coherence. Yes, the film has to be given some latitude, narratively, but open endedness, to a fault, is still a fault. That Kiesloski did not repeat this in his later films is a recognition of this fact, and may explain his near obsessive need for tying up the ends of the Three Colors Trilogy in Red. Such things as how Alexandre got Weronika's possessions? Could he be the lover that Weronika was leaving Antek for? After all, he's famous and travels. Thus his later obsession with her twin, when he meets her, would have psychological resonance, as well as explain his stalking and sending of things. One can resist the temptation to figure out every last detail in a film like this, for much does not stand up to intellectual scrutiny, but to not ground the narrative in some bit of internal diegetic reality is to rob the film of its solid foundation.
  The Double Life Of Vronique ultimately misses greatness, if by a hair, because of these flaws- such as its too contrived, and lacking in chemistry, romance, for it often tries to force its implausible mystery at the viewer, rather than letting it evolve more subtly. In this way, its directed ending- even if more mysterious, is actually more in line with the Pulp Fiction sort of storytelling than that in the Three Colors Trilogy, which might explain why The Double Life Of Vronique was highly awarded, whereas Red lost out to Quentin Tarantino's convoluted yet plot driven film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. The ending, where Alexandre tells Vronique of his plan for a book similar to the film is simply too much, and such preciousness is a flaw in the screenplay by Kieslowski and Piesiewicz. One wonders what a greater screenwriter, like Bergman, could have done with these ideas. He certainly would have muted some of the obviousness, for even in Persona- another overrated, but greater, film, he does not go so far as to have the two aspects of what could be one person/persona played by a single actress. Thus, the film relies more on its strengths- which are undoubtedly great: the acting of the sensual yet innocent Jacob, and the evocative imagery, where the narrative's oneiric progression works best in its hermetic cosmos, crafting the dialogue of the two women from silence, even as the camera fixates on the radiant Jacob.
  I wonder if Kieslowski was aware of the scientific studies done on twins separated at birth, and if this fact influenced this film, even to the point that the two women were, indeed, twins- one adopted by a Polish family, and the other by a French family? Such a hint that this might be the case could be evinced through further watchings, which I shall engage in, and which might just raise this slyly intriguing cocktease of a film above the bar for greatness. Until that time, however, I am left with the critical truism that while the narrative interior of a film can get away with not being analyzed too closely, the same cannot always be said for its exterior workings. This is why the film left me with a lack, yet why I also will view it again. Sometimes success and failure can have the same result. Other times not. Just ask Weronika/Vronique.",1221782400,,5223,4.795555555555556
3009940,5,B000XXWE1M,"Director Krzysztof Kieslowski had previously explored the concept of multiple and parallel possibilities in life for the same person with his film, PRZYPADEK, (BLIND CHANCE) 1987, and with a brief subplot in the ninth episode of THE DECALOGUE (1990). With VERONIQUE, he probed deeper into the metaphysical probabilities in life, and postulated that each of us could, or might have a ""doppelganger"" out there, walking on this sphere just as we are, two almost identical parts of the same spiritual entity, and two separate but nearly identical souls. We can, or might be ""aware"" of that other presence, and we could share insights, instincts, fears, mishaps, dangers, and health issues.

Weronika (Irene Jacob) lived in Poland, a young woman still residing at home with her father. She has a fabulous natural singing voice, and is discovered one day by a famous music teacher--but she also has a cardiac condition that she does not deal with. Disregarding her heart problems, she launched into strenuous voice training, and plunged headlong into a fledgling career--but during what would have been a triumphant singing debut, she collapsed and died mid-performance.

We then are introduced to Veronique (Irene Jacob) who lived in France. She was a music teacher, who seemed to be taking singing lessons. She had recently returned from a trip to Poland, and without realizing it, she and Weronika had glimpsed each other while in the Great Square at Krakow. Weronika had seen Veronique clearly, although she made little of it. Veronique had snapped a photograph of Weronika without recognition of her. There is a myth that if we ever meet our doppelganger, one of us will die. Krieslowski seemed to subscribe to this notion.

Moments after Weronika's death, Veronique while making love suddenly felt a tremendous loss, an overwhelming sense of grief--somehow becoming aware that she was now ""alone"" in the world. She immediately contacted her singing teacher and cancelled her lessons, abandoned the notion of a singing career. This cross over of instinct or genetic knowledge was not explained--it is just presented.

Most of the film dealt with Veronique's life in France. She fell in love with a dashing and mysterious writer and puppeteer, who somehow seemed to ""understand"" the duality of her nature, and of her life. When he created two puppets, possibly representing this probability, Veronique fled from the relationship, fled from her full recognition of her special circumstance. It was if Weronika had ventured forth first on this firmament, like a fraternal twin, taking a breath mere minutes before the other. The choices she made for herself, however catastrophic, resulted somehow to serve as guidelines and considerations later for Veronique.

Kieslowski presented us several delicious overlapping and synchronicious symbols and objects that became the common warp and weave of the two lives in both countries--leaves, upside down imagery, landscapes, churches, colors, string, fathers, missing mothers, toys, and a weak heart among others; nothing overt yet still significant enough to reinforce our tingle of deju vu. There is a reoccurring character in both scenarios--a stern looking woman is a large hat; reminiscent of the angelic ""observer"" who appeared in most of the episodes of DECOLOGUE.

Kieslowski's universe was both Gnostic and existential, natural and surrealistic, mundane and nearly surreal at times--but there is no doubt that he led the way for many other film directors to explore to notions and philosophies he created. Many of us presently are less impressed with him than we should be, for we are inundated with CGI games that effortlessly offer us multiple choices for specific outcomes. We make one choice and our character is killed. We simply rewind, back up and start over, making another choice and hoping to emerge victorious, the master of our fantasy scenario. In the 1980's however this was a ""new"" twist, a new concept--the role of both chance and parallel histories.

THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE (1991) took Cannes and the world by storm in 1991--despite its nonsensical plot premise and unorthodox structure, liberally mixing non-linear and parallel storylines with metaphysical postulates. I feel that it is a classic, a barn burner, a trend setter, and it is not to be missed.",1204070400,,4330,5.230547550432276

Although oblivious to the other's existence, Veronika, an aspiring Polish soprano, and Vronique, a Parisian music teacher, gradually become aware that they are connected to a spiritual twin.

My Review:

His earliest film to date that undertakes the acting of Irne Jacob.

The themes embellished are of a deep mysterious balance of fate upon the lives of two women sharing more that several physical and psychological traits. It doesn't push the idea of them being linked by pure coincidence or a grander design, just touches on it and lets you decide for yourself.

The mosaic shots really do emphasise the warmth of the worlds inhabited by Veronika in Krakow and Vronique in Paris, with a score that balance them as much as each other. The style is almost the same as the Three Colours trilogy, as Jacob would be in the concluding part. Nevertheless, the one of the most enjoyable incomplete scenes is of the reverie by the tree, leaving it to the audiences mind to fill in the gaps.

Compelling, intricate and visually beautiful, you would get the sense of a mood and almost dreamlike structure to it, as if it had been filmed on the warmth of a lazy Summer afternoon. Krzysztof Kieslowski: rest in peace.

Verdict:

Kieslowski shows why modern day Dramas like Haggis's emotionally contrived 'Crash' tries to 'Hollywood' the real impact of love, grit and realism. 9/10.",1203724800,,1379,4.888412017167382
3009942,3,B000XXWE1M,"A comment on the DVDs, and a comment on the movie.

Both Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and the screenwriter comment on how few scenes Kieslowski picked from the vast amount he had shot, to make this short movie. Jacob even says she hardly recognized the film she had worked on when she saw it in the theater. The screenwriter says that five movies could have been made from the scenes shot. -- The movie is one hour 35 minutes long. That leaves four and a half hours for the two Criterion DVDs to show us some of these deleted scenes. Guess what? No deleted scenes. This annoyed me.

As to the film, the first image shows Veronika, the Polish girl, singing ecstatically as the rain falls on her face, while the rest of the chorus has taken refuge from the rain. -- The second image is of her making love passionately to her boyfriend. She is innocent, beautiful, full of promise, and doomed to die at a young age.

The two V&eacute;roniques cross paths when the French girl is on a tour bus and sees the Polish girl standing in a square where a political demonstration is taking place.

The Polish girl's segment lasts 28 minutes, and is wonderful. Each image seems to weigh on us, to pull us in by its meaning as well as its beauty. When Veronika dies of a heart attack in the middle of a concert, we share her view of the dirt being tossed onto her body under the ground. All these images are memorable.

The second part is a different story. The French V&eacute;ronique is a music teacher who becomes fascinated by a soulful puppeteer. He gives her mysterious signs that he loves her, and they make love in the penultimate scene of the movie.

This is a clich&eacute;, this has been done. One example is LILI with Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer, 1954. This story is stale, and the second two-thirds of the movie feel stale compared to the first 28 minutes. V&eacute;ronique's relationship with the puppeteer, as other reviewers have observed, leaves us unmoved.

As in his other films, Kieslowski inserts subtle parallels between the two stories. A strand of twine attaching pages of music is twisted by the Polish girl; later the French girl receives a shoelace in the mail. The little clear ball is seen in both episodes. A woman who looks at the Polish girl with strange hostility is matched by a woman in the French train station who looks at V&eacute;ronique in a similar way. The puppeteer's ballerina dies much as the Polish girl died.

The climax of the movie is when the puppeteer discovers a picture of the Polish girl in the French girl's purse. Seeing it, she is overcome with grief. He makes love to her, and her sobs of grief gradually turn into gasps of pleasure and finally orgasm. To me this scene is dramatically unseemly, a sort of cop-out. Something far better should have been here. But something far better than the puppeteer should have filled the last hour.

With enough scenes to make five movies, Kieslowski settled on this one-hour story of the girl and the puppeteer. I think he made a mistake, a fatal error in judgment. This kind of error can be seen in his other films as well. Failure to use the best scenes to the best effect, lapsing into banality when he should be at his best. Missing the opportunity to put in the scene that would have made the film a classic.

He once described himself as ""just so-so"" as a filmmaker. I think that is accurate. He has great moments, but too many weak moments.",1194652800,,3420,4.528363047001621

""Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that manages to combine beauty and depth, with a great lead actress and brilliant director. And there's a luminous, quiet quality to the film that not many movies are able to convey, from the beginning to end.

And it's wrapped with just enough ambiguity to leave you wondering what it's all about. Is it about twin souls, love, sacrifice, fate, politics, being puppets in the grand scehem of things, or just about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? Even the ending is ambiguous; Kieslowski allows you to wonder whether happiness or grief is in the cards.

One thing you can be sure of -- Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art.

Kieslowski, one of the best filmmakers of this past century knew this. Here we have a unique and beautiful film exploring the metaphysical in a wonderful tale of two women sharing the same name and looks but living in different places Weronika/Veronique, a story that leaves you asking yourself more questions than getting answers, as art often does. Kieslowski's paintbrush is as delicate and subtle as the acting by Irene Jacob who was only 24 years old, by the way, when this film was made. Anything else that could be pointed out of the plot would be irrelevant, since it's open to so many interpretations. Criterion's superb transfer is truly worth every cent, get it if you are the kind of viewer who likes once in a while to be captivated by a film in a different way.",1170892800,,904,4.6918238993710695
3009952,3,B000XXWE1M,"""Double life"" is a supremely well photographed and designed film, with a georgeous actress, not quite of this world, who sticks in the attention of the camera like a blood clot in the narrows of an artery. The rave reviews certainly indicate that the film speaks to many, especially folks who feel there is something magical and wonderous out there that we glimpse in our dreams and play with in our imaginations, something that repays our attentions with tingles of intuition from time to time.

For those of us who are empiricists, however, the film may be less appealing. To us hard-nosers, the characters are phantoms, ideals, and destractions that teach little about what life on earth is truly about. We remember the tingles that coincidentally approximate future events and forget the vast majority of them that prove false. This is human nature, and to the extent that this is a part of our psyches, ""Double Life"" may prove absorbing.

What I'm trying to say, somewhat gently, is this film isn't for everyone. Some, like myself, will admire the stunning photography and color of the DVD version, ogle Ms. Jacob, enjoy the beautiful but truncated music, laugh at the fantasy of the plot, cringe at yet another exercise of a director in love with his leading lady, grant that some may batten on fairy dust, but in the end ask, ""Where's the beef?""",1168992000,,1352,4.798283261802575
3009953,5,B000XXWE1M,"There are two women at the center of The Double Life of Veronique and they are both played by Irene Jacob. Veronique is a French music teacher, Weronika is a Polish singer. They have the same hair cut, wear similar clothes, use lip balm, and even share a heart condition. There are other similarities about their lives, but what's more notable are their differences. Weronika first becomes aware of her French counterpart in Krakow Square, where she watches her snap photos of a political demonstration before the doppelganger is whisked away by a tourist bus. One might be inclined to think they are the same woman, but they are not, as much as we are defined not by who we are but what we do.

Some are better at doing than others. We first meet Weronika as she is ""doing,"" so to speak: she sings with a chorus of others when rain begins to fall. While others run for cover, she holds her note, turning her face up to the sky. Soaked, she meets a man afterwards in a covered alleyway. They make love. Despite her lack of formal music training (or perhaps because of), Weronika is later discovered by a prestigious music company. She is, as they say, going places, except she isn't - her story is cut short in a manner I will keep to myself. Weronika remains, for the most part (like the film), a beautiful mystery.

While Weronika (the artist) is a person who does or simply is, Veronique (the teacher, the critic) analyzes, deconstructs, and covets. It's not by accident that we first saw her taking those photographs, indeed taking one of Weronika, the woman she would want to be if she knew her (Veronique teaches her students the songs that Weronika sings). The next time we meet her is also as she makes love, an act interrupted when Veronique strangely begins to cry. ""Are you sad?"" her lover asks. ""I don't know why. It's as if I were grieving."" She does grieve, in the way that people grieve for themselves and the lives they do not live.

While at a marionette show (one that tells a story of death and rebirth much paralleling her own). Veronique becomes infatuated with the charismatic puppeteer, so much so that she misses much of the performance. The puppeteer engages her (like our director, Kryzysztof Kieslowski, engages us) in a mystery of sorts, sending Veronique mundane household items through the post, items that hold significance in the popular children's books he has written. She turns them over in her hands, staring at them with rapt fascination, marveling perhaps at how the artist can give meaning to something as banal as a piece of shoelace or an empty cigar box. Perhaps it's envy of the artist, the god-like giver of life. Or maybe Veronique is simply happy to have some element of mystical and irrational romance in her life.

The Double Life of Veronique has been called a ""metaphysical mystery,"" not incorrectly, though what mystery there is does not have resolution. Like many of Kieslowski's great films, Veronique is about questions not answers, journeys not destinations. Doing not deconstructing. We are constantly asked, begged, to discard our laziness and see the world from varying perspectives - upside down, through smoke and colored glass, even from behind spectacles or a magnifying lens (I'd be remiss if I did not mention how gorgeously photographed this film is by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, who also shot Black Hawk Down). There are other worlds besides the one we think we see, ones that might have been and still could be, and in these worlds we can be the people whom we hoped we would.

Interesting footnote: Kieslowski was a juror at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, where Steven Soderbergh's sex, lies and videotape took the Palme d'Or. He originally imagined that film's actress Andie McDowell as the lead in Veronique but later changed his mind.",1168992000,,3811,4.7681818181818185

One of his most abstract but alluring films, The Double Life Of Veronique is filled with some of the most beautiful and unique images (and music) caught on film.  Don't let the lack of standard Hollywood plot structure throw you, this is, in fact, one of the film's best assets.  Considering that Kieslowski had originally established himself as a documentary filmmaker makes this film an even greater discovery.  It's elliptical storyline, carefully drawn characters, wonderful visual style are wholly imbued with with ideas about universal truths that makes this strange film so accessible.  Kieslowski has been one of the most influential filmmakers in today's cinema with dozens of imitators (films like Crash, Babel, 21 Grams, Sliding Doors, Magnolia and more all owe a significant nod to Kieslowski).  I would not recommend this film for anyone under 15.  There is some nudity and eroticism and light profanity, but the good-natured tone and visual pleasure of this film shouldn't threaten a young teen and, in this viewer's opinion, would enrich.

3009955,5,B000XXWE1M,"I'll say nothing about the film, there are several good reviews here.  I had previously only seen this film on tape from television, and while I admired it greatly, I always wondered why the film was so muddy and grainy.  The yellowish wash over the film only made it worse.  I always viewed it as a transition film, between his earlier Polish work and Three Colors, where he presumably finally had the money to produce the stunning images in ""Red"" and ""Blue"".

Well, I was wrong, I was seeing a different film.  To get the idea, look at the first shot in the interview segment, of the concert.  That's how the whole film looked to me before, night and day.  Congratulations to all involved in the Criterion production of this film.  Long overdue, but well done indeed.  Thank heavens in the future people will see the film in this condition.",1166918400,,842,4.56
3009956,5,B000XXWE1M,"It's somewhat difficult to recommend this amazing film to a mainstream American audience as this is as quintessentially European a movie-going experience as you're ever likely to find.  That said, film remains a universal language, and this is also the most eloquent, mysterious and refined picture of human beauty you will ever come across.

Director Krzystof Kieslowski is best known for his renowned ""Thee Colors"" film trilogy: 'Blue', 'White' and 'Red'.  This film preceded those and is even more powerful if less well known.  It tells the story of two women living in different countries whose lives are mysteriously intertwined.  The story unfolds slowly, suffused with shatteringly haunting music and bathed in a golden, vaguely sepia-tinted haze.  You have never seen or heard anything like it before.  And if you are vulnerable to it's considerable magic you will never be able to forget it.

Heading into 2007 this kind of cinema seems almost lost to a world seemingly being swallowed up daily in crass, bombastic, essentially pornographic imagery; garbage that litters our televisions and movie screens without respite.  If you've seen too much of it, even acquiring something of a taste for it, this film may not be for you.  It may well be lost to you and if so you are immeasurably the poorer for it.  I am sorry for your loss.

If however you are the type of person who was able to enjoy something like 'Lost In Translation' and you've never seen 'The Double Life of Veronique', consider this is your lucky day.  This meticulously transferred, lovingly crafted, rich and respectful Criterion Collection edition is an unsurpassed experience.  Get it.  Get it and trust that you'll be in the loving hands of a master as you enjoy this the greatest, most compassionate, subtle and truly beautiful cinema ever created.",1166486400,,1829,5.009933774834437

I will never forget how I saw this movie for the first time. I caught in on the Bravo channel over 10 years ago when Bravo used to show the great films (""The Conformist"", ""Marriage - Italian Style"", etc). I did not know anything about ""La Double vie de Vronique"" but I was glued to the screen. The mystery of two identical girls that were born in the different countries, spoke different languages, never met (or did they?) but whose lives were strangely connected has stayed with me for all these years. Do we all have a twin somewhere? What if we do? Do I want to meet her? Would we understand each other? Would we recognize each other or simply pass on the street and never will know that something important was about to happen but just did not...I will also remember ""Double vie.."" for introducing me to Irene Jacob and for one of the greatest film scores ever - the concert by Van den Budenmayer, a fictitious Dutch composer whose music is written by the regular Kieslowski's associate, Zbigniew Preisner).",1166313600,,1055,4.582010582010582
3009965,5,B000XXWE1M,"When The Double Life of Veronique was screened at the Cannes Film Festival it not only brought international acclaim and attention to its director Krzysztof Kieslowski but also to the film's star, Irene Jacob. At the time, the 24-year-old Swiss actress was virtually unknown but she would go on to even greater acclaim when she teamed up with Kieslowski again on Red, the final film in his Three Colours trilogy.

Criterion has gone all out with this edition managing to improve the already impressive MK2 region 2 release. There is a 64-page booklet that features an excellent collection of essays pertaining to the movie.

The first disc features an audio commentary by Kieslowski biographer Annette Insdorf. She points out that Kieslowski got his start making documentaries and that The Double Life of Veronique saw him moving into a ""deeply poetic brand of cinematic storytelling."" Insdorf, who contributed commentaries for Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, delivers a thoughtful track with excellent insight and analysis that is very accessible.

Also included are three short documentaries that Kieslowski made - Factory (1970), Hospital (1976) and Railway (1980) along with The Musicians (1958) made by Kazimierz Karabasz, a great influence on the Polish director. These are interesting glimpses at Kieslowski's progression as a filmmaker.

There is also ""The U.S. Ending."" Miramax distributed the film in North America and its head, Harvey Weinstein, asked Kieslowski to make it less ambiguous. Included is this additional footage that provides a neater resolution.

The second disc starts off with ""Kieslowski - Dialogue,"" a 1991 documentary on the making of The Double Life of Veronique. There is lots of fantastic on-the-set footage of the man at work directing his actors. This documentary provides fascinating insight into the film and the filmmaker.

""1966-1988: Kieslowski, Polish Filmmaker"" is a 2005 documentary that takes a look at his work in Poland. It traces his development as a filmmaker through the 1960s to the 1980s making short films, documentaries and feature films.

""Slawomir Idziak"" is an interview with the film's cinematographer. Idziak mentions that many of Kieslowski's collaborators weren't thrilled with Jacob's screen tests but when his daughter and her friends loved what they saw, the director realized he was making a movie for young people and that he had found the right person for the role.

Also included is an interview with long-time Kieslowski composer Zbigniew Preisner. He praises the director for being the down-to-earth type and talks about the challenges of being a composer in Poland.

Finally, there is a wonderful interview with Irene Jacob. She talks about the first Kieslowski film she saw and the first time she met him. It was an audition for The Double Life of Veronique and he asked her to improvise. It lasted all afternoon and she was thrilled just to work with him for that day. Two weeks later, he interviewed her and she got the part. Jacob speaks eloquently about working on the film, her technique and her experience with Kieslowski.",1164844800,,3104,5.229376257545272
3009966,5,B000XXWE1M,"This, Krzysztof Kieslowski's greatest film, is the sort of story that approaches a part of the mind few people ever utilize. Set in both Krakow, Poland during the fall of Communism, and France during the same period, The Two Lives of Veronica concerns a pair of young women, played with total perfection by the beautiful Irne Jacob, who, though all intents and purposes it can be said never meet, were born on the same night, lost their mothers at the same age, were raised to young adulthood by their fathers, and who are all-but identical to one another in appearance. Weronika, the carefree Polish woman, is a gifted singer. Vronique, Weronika's moody French ""doppelganger"" teaches music at a public school. Where Weronika is outgoing and happy, Vronique is deeper, quieter, more pensive.

We begin the first third of the film with the story mostly centered around Weronika's life in Poland, where she has recently moved from a small town into Krakow, away from her father. She is fond of an aunt there, a woman who reads Tarot cards for her niece and foretells that which she says is to come in her future. ""All the women in our family die suddenly,"" she tells Weronika,. ""Your mother died suddenly, I will die suddenly, and so shall you."" Weronika is too young and joyous to think of such a thing and only wishes to know about love. She has a boyfriend, a black leather jacketed rebel whose anti-Communist and pro-western views are symbolized by his reverence for the motorcycle we see him riding in most of the scenes. Weronika makes love to the young man while standing in a doorway in the rain, something she, raised in a pastoral region, would never have had the courage to do before her move to the city, and she feels at that instant that all is perfection. Beautiful, heedless, aglow with the way her life is unfolding, Weronika is envied for the sheer joy she feels. She also possesses a lovely voice, and while untrained, her raw talent is soon recognized by the directors of a local symphony. Given the chance to premiere a musical work re-discovered after several centuries in obscurity, Weronika is thrilled. She steps onto the stage on opening night, and begins her performance.

Meanwhile, at that precise instant in France, Vronique feels herself suddenly emotionally overcome. It is as if in one moment of immense feeling she has suddenly lost possession of her own being. Confused, she goes thru her life during the weeks that follow merely undertaking the motions of normality. She teaches school, she takes her students to see a wondrously artistic puppet show, and she sleeps with several men.  Still feeling herself lost, cut off from who she'd always thought herself to be, she even agrees to help a friend by making a ruinously cruel accusation against a man she does not even know. Puzzled by her own conduct, Vronique is finally led to the pinnacle of harsh understanding by a strange, remotely threatening figure of a man who comes to be in her life, almost against her wishes. The revelation of the reason for her state---which we already knew---comes as little relief to Vronique, and while she comprehends that she has spent her entire life as part of a unique miracle of bi-location, there is little consolation to it all.

The things one sees and feels in this film, from masterful location shots, to sudden shocks of plot development, to the scene with the beautiful puppet show, all these are so distinctly, unhurriedly European that I'm convinced no American could have made this film in exactly this way. The score Zbigniew Preisner composed for this wonderful film is unforgettable, as well. Above all else the vibrant performance Irne Jacob grants in playing two greatly different women is the best of her career. This touching motion picture strikes deep into the human spirit.",1159833600,,3820,4.8274809160305345

Such is the start of the movie ""The Double Life of Veronique"".

An odd chance encounter with a children's book author and a puppeteer helps Veronique to get insights into her condition and feelings. The puppeteer thinks he is making up yet another one of his stories, but unbeknown to him he is helping Veronique unlock the secrets of her existence.

I found the movie ""Double Life"" the most dream like and the most mystical of all Kieslowski's movies that I had seen. In fact it isn't a movie, I would call it visual poetry. Since the plot and story are only a pretext to engage you on a subconscious level. The movie is starring actress Irene Jacobe and in the movie she is beautiful, child like in her innocence and passion for life. Yet a grown woman in her physical appearance. In the movie we get to see her in various states of dress and undress. As I watched the movie I had the feeling as if Kieslowski was in love with Irene Jacobe and he made the movie so that he could make love to her with his camera. The movie is erotic to the extreme, yet lovely and innocent in a way I can't explain.

I am not going to tell you the ending, but the only thing I will say is that only Kieslowski could make a movie that has a tragically sad and immensely happy ending all at once.

There were a couple of elements I didn't understand in the movie. I am sure they are in there for a reason, but I simply haven't been able to place them. The whole subplot where Veronique agrees to testify in court that she slept with her friend's ex ... what was that about? The other thing I didn't understand was the symbolism of Veronique rubbing a ring against her eye lashes.

I feel like I need to go see the movie again to fully understand it.",1158278400,,1903,4.214285714285714

This is almost certainly a PAL (not NTSC as shown) format disc, which most North American DVD/TV combinations would not play (the R4 region coding would be a problem as well).  Amazon really needs to crack down on the third-party entries in the DVD section to make sure they have correct information, show they are an import, don't duplicate an existing ASIN, etc.

I think the North American rights to ""Double Life of Veronique"" may be a bit more tangled than those abroad (I've seen references to both Paramount and Miramax having them), which may be why we aren't getting this.

Ir'ne Jacob does an excellent job in portraying both the Veronika/Veronique characters.  This is a fine movie worthy of anyones collection.

UPDATE!

I agree with Brian Miller (Columbus, Ohio).  Amazon pulls this stunt every once in a while.  The same thing happened with ""Six Pack"" with an advertized release date of Sept 2005, then Jan 2010 and finally and ironically April 4, 2006.  I'm not sure how these things get by but with the volume of items available on Amazon, sometimes mistakes do happen.  This is a very irritating situation but in perspective, this is nothing compared to say the missing laugh tracks on T.A.G.S. Season #4.  At least this could be a sign that TDLOV is hopefully on the way.

Another UPDATE!

Okay, after perusing Amazon.com/UK and Germany, it appears that a two disc, Region 2 edition will be released on April 24, 2006.

 Director Kieslowski is good at describing two things at the same time. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful classical music. These techniques contribute to give something abstract and philosophical impression. Irene Jacob played both Weronika and Veronique and won the best actress of the Cannes film festival in 1991.

3009995,5,B000XXWE1M,"One of Krzysztof Kieslowski's finest films is ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (""La Double vie de Vronique""). It's not just a philosophical, arty film, but a subtle and unique tale full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives Irne Jacob a chance to shine in her most challenging role.
There are two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique (both played by Irne Jacob). They have never met, never spoken, and do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer.
What is more, each has the strange feeling that she is, somehow, not alone in the world. One night, Weronika dies onstage while singing. Suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling, and stops taking her lessons. Weronika has died, but she still lives. Soon she begins to explore, searching for the truth about her double life, and a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.
""Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that just begs to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? About fate? Sacrifice? Love? One woman's soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols and metaphors can be unwound any which way, and in the end they all work. Even the ending is ambiguous -- is it happy, or sad?
Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art. He dots ""Double Life"" with plenty of little hints about the inner states of the characters. The stars and leaves, for example, hint at the personalities of Weronika and Veronique -- one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.
At times this film seems like a love letter on film to Irne Jacob. Not only is she followed constantly by the camera, but her character is difficult but rewarding. Jacob shines without really seeming to, with the emotion and wonder of a small child in an adult body. Philippe Volter's aura of mystery adds to his excellent acting in his too-brief scenes. Unfortunately, few of the other characters are given much dimension -- the whole focus is on Weronika and Veronique.
This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpret it as you will. Kieslowski's ""Double Life of Veronique"" is exquisite.",1077926400,,2684,4.91409691629956

3009999,5,B000XXWE1M,"I imagine this film is subtly autobiographical because the director is Polish and yet his films are all made in French. So the two Veroniques could quite possibly be the twin creative personas or muses of Kieslowski himself. The one Veronique is Polish and dies singing, the other lives on in France but with a sense of having missed the one important connection in her life. So the film feels like an allegory of lives or destinies unfulfilled and the most obvious destiny that was cut short was Poland's but this film does not make speeches, it whispers.
As an artist living and creating in exile Kieslowski must himself have felt divided into two parts. Modern life feeling impersonal is a classic theme of the twentieth century yet the way Kieslowski tells it it does not feel at all cliched, rather he breathes new life and new understanding into what it means to live in the modern world. His allegory presents a very high vision of humanity which makes us all feel responsible and connected to each other in some way. But the appeal of the film is that it says everything in such an intimate way. Veronique is a film which becomes richer with each viewing. Kieslowski's films tap into a very new kind of place that has no language barriers. His films return to a purity that is almost silent. A universality is present in his art that is quite breathtaking.",1034985600,,1364,4.617283950617284

To say this is 'one of the most beautiful movies and Kieslowski is a genius' is stating the obvious. It is a dream and ... who else to dream about, other than the beautiful Irene Jacob!
Irene herself is a dream in this movie as she portrays two gifted look-alike musicians, sharing the names Veronique (in France) and Weronika (in Poland). They share the same ill-health, destiny and sadness. And they share an unknown effect on each other's life, despite being worlds apart. The inexplicable depression that Veronique feels when Weronika dies while performing on a stage, makes you ponder 'whether in my life I too wasn't depressed for some or other inexplicable reasons?' 'Is there another I somewhere concerned about me?' 'Is that why I was sad during that time?' 'Is someone else sharing my sorrows being somewhere in this world?' 'Will I meet him/her sometime? Somewhere?' Yes, unanswerable questions, inexplicable feelings and surrealistic thoughts. That sums up this movie.
There is an excellent sub-plot too, a puppet and its master. It is very symbolic and highly metaphorical. I still don't think I understood it properly. The music is haunting. Like the violin in ""Un Couer en Hiver"", Veronique's vocal music stikes chord with you. It is enchanting and sad at the same time. Close your eyes and you are drowned in dreams!
Irene Jacob is dreamy and natural, aimless, sympathetic, gorgeous, child-like innocent and sexy at the same time. She definitely deserves all the awards for her stunning double role.
'La double vie de Veronique' comes out with flying colours when compared with Kieslowski's much acclaimed colour trilogy (White, Blue and Red). Watch this movie seriously, you will enjoy it. Thank you Kieslowski!",1003708800,,1755,5.076124567474048

3010004,5,B000XXWE1M,"""The Double Life of Veronique"" [1991: Krzysztof Kieslowski, Director; starring Irene Jacob, Best Actress Award, Cannes Film Festival 1991] is a metaphorically rich and haunting drama. This beautifully filmed story parallels two musically gifted young women [both played by Irene Jacob] with the same first name [Weronika [Polish] / Veronique [French]], mirror images of each other, born on the exact same date in different countries [Poland/France], suffering from like physical frailties, with similar possessions/character traits, who are total strangers whose paths cross briefly only once. Yet each senses the presence of an ""unknown other"", an overwhelming impression of ""not being alone in the world"". The subtle affect that these women have on each others' lives - unknowingly and at a distance -- is hauntingly reinforced by the ""dreamlike"" cinematic attributes of the film. The premise of ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is that there are undeniable, irrepressible, conscious and subconscious connections and intersecting forces in life that impact us all - transcending and defying distance, time, culture and conventional reason.
There are concentric subplots that emanate from this central story involving various lovers [one is an accomplished, but manipulative puppeteer who creates 2 more ""Veroniques"" in the form of marionettes], significant emotional events that turn the course of lives and causing individual stories to dissolve/meld into others, strong parental bonds and familial grounding, the power of music/art as a life catalyst.
The gold light that permeates this film, occasional blurred imagery of memory flashbacks and the sequences with the ""mariposas de luz"" [flickering butterflies of light from mirror reflections] truly conjure a dream-state aura that at times borders on the supernatural. The various symbolic threads in the film [death/renaissance, kaleidoscopic perspectives on life, the two young women as political emblems of the European community, the poetic symbolism of a ballerina puppet who transforms into a butterfly, etc.] rock the collective unconscious of the viewer - allowing the imagination to wander. The musical backdrop for the film serves as a leitmotif that links both the Polish and French sequences with an indomitable spirit and awe. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" pre-dates Kieslowski's Red, White and Blue Trilogy [1994] - and could easily be re-titled ""Gold"" in the director's creative alchemical spectrum of films.
In interviews, Kieslowski revealed that he created different endings for the film for different cultural audiences - further reinforcing the ""multiple"" dimensions of his concept. I found the film to be sensorially and thematically stunning - and the acting superb. If you don't mind reading subtitles, or already understand Polish and/or French, appreciate this type of out-of-the mainstream, esoteric genre, and don't have the compulsive need to have every question explicitly resolved - I highly recommend this film.",1000944000,,2997,5.662222222222222

It is an interesting exploration of Veronique's life after Veronika dies, and of how Veronique feels a profound sense of loss at the death of her twin. This film was directed by Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski just before he made his Bleu, Blanc, Rouge trilogy. While this film is a bit oblique and hard to follow at times, it is worthwhile for its dark and fascinating subject matter and the sensual treatment of the scenery and characters. Also notable is the gorgeous soundtrack by frequent Kieslowski collaborator Zbigniew Preisner.",992131200,,733,5.116666666666666
3010007,4,B000XXWE1M,"Much of this is an adoration of French actress Irne Jacob byDirector Krzysztof Kieslowski; in a sense it is a homage to her, oneof the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented.  If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin.  She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her.  Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected.  She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.

The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red).  The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka.  But the main point is Irne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves.  We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe.  And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.

Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd.  Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there.  Vronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her...  She loves her father and old people.  She is a teacher of children.  She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true.  And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point: she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.

An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties: there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998).  It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.

Note that as Weronika/Vronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life.  It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star.  This film is his way of making love to her.

Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs: Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994).  We could use another like him.  END

3010008,5,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life of Veronique is an absolutely stunning film.  The director, whose work includes Decalogue and the superb Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, and Red), displays a confident tone in his deliberate pacing  and the subtle way in which he establishes the mood of this picture.  In  Irene Jacob (also the star of Red), he finds the perfect leading lady, who  has an innocent yet mysterious and beautiful aura which works so well with  the tone of this film.
There isn't really a plotline in this movie, but  in general, it concerns the lives of two women  (Veronique and Veronikka,  both played by Irene Jacob) born on the same day but in different  countries.  Though they lead separate lives, there are parallels drawn in  their existence, and their paths cross ever so briefly as the story of one  woman dissolves into the story of the second.  There is a distinct  dreamlike quality to this film, and certainly, mood rather than narrative  is the dominant driving force to the film.
Most Americans will consider  this film to be a typical European ""art house"" film.

My thoughts exactly.

The director is now long gone, but I've just watched this film so it's fresh to me. And rubbed me so very wrong.

Except for the lingering views of Ms Jacob's fine young breasts (in thoroughly gratuitous sex scenes), this film had absolutely no redeeming value whatever. I can accept attempts by a young director that fall short. Not so much when a ""master"" has nothing to say and then tries to impress us with his superior cleverness.

This film stinks so badly.

---------------

After writing the above, I looked to see what professional reviewers I respect thought of the film. Roger Ebert loved it as much as I did not. From his review: ""The last thing you want to do after a Kieslowski film is 'unravel' the plot. It can't be done."" Indeed.

Ebert didn't know the meaning of the shoe string or the flasher either. Just more ""genius"" we mere mortals are incapable of comprehending.

I stand by my opinion, except to add that the cinematography was quite good, if in a quite bad film.

Yes, I do feel a bit unsure swimming against the tide, railing against a film loved by so many. I'm not saying my judgment is right, just that it's mine, and your mileage may vary.

Let me add that this film is an example of my never going to reviews before watching a film (or reading a book, or hearing a CD): so that I can experience it with no preconceptions and better able to enjoy any surprises I might encounter. I forget how this film got in my public library account to be placed on hold. Maybe the director mentioned in a magazine, the article skimmed just enough to get me to add the film to my queue. Then, into the player, onto the screen, and for what it's worth, an independent judgment.

Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the difining filmmakers in 80s and 90s art house cinema and sadly passed away in 1996 at age 54. He understood the limits of closure in cinema which I think is this work's most unique quality. The Three Colors Trilogy that would follow may be more accalimed and celebrated if not more fully realised but Veronique is still a personal favorite of mine from the period for its lavish colors and tour de force peformance from Irene Jacob.

3244386,5,B000XXWE1M,"Krzysztof Kielowskis 1991 masterpiece The Double Life of Vronique (La Double vie de Vronique) is quite simply one of the most beautiful films ever made. This is evidenced on virtually every level  an extraordinarily empathetic and intensely moving central double performance from Irne Jacob, a superbly oneiric musical score from Zbigniew Preisner, gorgeous sepia-toned cinematography from Sawomir Idziak, and a deeply rigorous and profound screenplay worked out with Kielowski from Krzysztof Piesiewicz which manages to be as light and fanciful on the one hand as it is spiritual and metaphysical on the other. Kielowski is famous for making down-to-earth disparaging comments about the possible deeper meanings that lie within his films (For me, a bottle of milk is simply a bottle of milkNothing more.), but despite the modesty on display there is no doubt that he is always getting at something altogether deeper and he welcomes interpretation by people if it means they connect with his films  I don't film metaphors. People only read them as metaphors, which is very good. Thats what I want. The greatest beauty of The Double Life of Vronique lies in its all-embracing open-endedness for it can be appreciated as much emotionally as it can intellectually and evidently embodies the very essence of what drives Kielowski to make films in the first place  Thats why I do this [make films]  to make people experience something. It doesnt matter if they experience it intellectually or emotionally. You make films to give people something to transport them somewhere else and it doesnt matter if you transport them to a world of intuition or a world of the intellect.

Kielowskis world of intuition is expressed in this film by an uncountable number of binary parallels and opposites inherent in the central premise. A film in two halves, two girls are born on the same day in 1966, Weronika in Poland and Vronique in France. The first we see of them is in 1968 when Weronika is shown the stars in the sky (the first star of Christmas) by her off-screen mother and Vronique is shown a leaf (the first leaf of spring) by hers. 98 minutes later the film (at least in the European print) closes on Vronique sitting in her car, the sky reflected in the windscreen and her hand reaching out to touch a tree  everything begins and ends in nature both spiritual and earthly. By 1990 both mothers have died and Weronika/Vronique are being raised by their loving fathers, both of whom are artists. Weronikas father is a painter while Vroniques is a wood craftsman. This continues the binary relationship between heavenly/spiritual and earthly/practical. Weronika/Vronique both have heart conditions and both have aspirations to be singers. Both girls feel the presence of the other even though they are ignorant of each other and the feeling defies rational explanation  The film is about sensibility, presentiments and relationships, which are difficult to name, which are irrational (Kielowski). Weronika tells her father she feels she is not alone in the world and when she dies, Vronique immediately feels bereft, as if she has lost a kindred spirit. She has her parallel conversation with her father in which she says she has recently felt she was alone in the world. Not only that, but she feels as if she is being guided  I always sense what I have to do, she says. When Weronika ignores her heart condition and continues to sing, her eventual death leads to Vronique deciding immediately to give up her singing lessons. As Kielowski says, Vroniques constantly faced with the choice of whether or not to take the same road as the Polish Weronika, whether to give in to the artistic instinct and the tension intrinsic in art or to give in to love and all that involves. This, basically, is her choice. The film shows Weronika destroying herself for art while Vronique chooses the power of love, the spirit of the dead Weronika haunting her with reminders of what she has given up. The intuition felt between the women takes us to the heart of Kielowskis world wherein human life is defined by choices made, the choices not made living on and haunting us as unrealized potentialities. This works both ways in the film for Weronika gives up her boyfriend Antek (Jerzy Gudejko) and with it the possibility of love by pursuing her singing, while Vronique gives up her artistic gift for the more ephemeral pleasures of love in the shape of the puppeteer/childrens author Alexandre Fabbri (Philippe Volter). This is subtly underlined in the film by their first lovemaking taking place in a hotel in room 287, the very same room number where Antek was vainly waiting in a different hotel (in a different country!) for Weronika earlier in the film. The pleasures are ephemeral because Alexandre turns out to be an artist who sublimates everything into his own art including Vroniques own life. Like Weronika he chooses art over love and Veronique is doomed to suffering as a consequence.

The films emotional pull relies strongly on recurring imagery which continues the binary structure of the film. Two countries are made to look and feel the same by use of the same golden filter over Idziaks camera and the incessant use of Preisners music which Weronika/Vronique are involved with. Weronika dies while singing a piece by a fictional 18th century composer Van der Budenmajer (Preisner of course) while Vronique later teaches the same score to her students at school. The same eerie high flute accompanies strange lights and spiritual visitations while effective keyboard pieces are deployed, one either side of the death which splits the film in two. Theres a beautiful harpsichord (harp? celesta?) piece which plays during Weronikas conversation with her father and then on through her train ride to Krakw. Then theres a simple but moving piano accompaniment to Alexandres puppet show story of a dancer who lives in her box, dances, breaks her leg and dies only to be reborn as a butterfly as the music goes back to the Budenmajer piece that killed Weronika. Clearly the puppet show acts as a conduit wherein Vronique sees her double dying and being reborn as a spirit which will continue to haunt her (she thinks) in the shape of Alexandre who effects a meeting through poetic means of his own. For Vronique her meeting with Alexandre is her spiritual destination, the co-joining with her other half which she has long felt and long wanted to meet. But she is destined to be disillusioned

With repeated viewings, we recognize the immense sophistication of Kielowskis binary scheme more and more. Room 287 highlights the films central preoccupation with chance and this is carried on through the subtle use of objects  a lip chap-stick used by Weronika found later in Vroniques handbag, a clear rubber ball with stars inside which Weronika plays with, studying the world through it out of the train window and then banging it with joy on the floor at having won an audition. This is later found by Alexandre among Vroniques handbag contents which she has spilled across the bed. Theres a ring which Weronika uses to massage the bottom of her eyes which Veronique also has and uses the same way much later. Then theres the near-meeting of Weronika/Vronique in Krakw where Weronika sees Vronique taking photos from a tour bus, the negative of which turns up later in her handbag, the photo of her Polish twin clearly visable along with the ball as she rises to orgasm in her lovers arms. Most bizarrely of all theres a shoe lace sent by Alexandre which is meant by Kielowski to symbolize the life line on an EKG reading which measures Weronikas/Vroniques heart. When stretched taut it means death so that when Vronique measures the lace alongside her EKG read-out and pulls the lace tight we immediately connect it with the earlier scene of Weronika tripping herself over her laces while running through a puddle and of her finishing her singing audition by pulling the string tying a score together taut as she reaches the most strenuous part  the part at which she will later die in concert. We also connect it with the rope we see holding Weronikas coffin as it is lowered into the ground, the extraordinary shot rendered as a point of view shot upwards from Weronikas dead body.

Kielowski realizes that life is beyond easy encapsulation and along with repetitive imagery which we can easily decipher there are also enigmatic elements which defy categorization such as the repeated image of an old woman walking along the street. In Poland the woman is lumbered with shopping and Weronika throws open the window, offering to help. In France Vronique relates her dream to her father of seeing an old woman walking up a road between trees towards a red-bricked church, but then we see her looking out of the window of her classroom where her kids are practicing Budenmajer and see the old woman, but with no shopping and no church. Actually we see the red bricked church earlier as Weronika (not Vronique) looks through her ball, the image upside down in a staggeringly beautiful poetic image. These images are as enigmatic as the ones of the old lady trying to put a bottle into a bottle bank in each of the Three Colors films. Perhaps the purpose is simply to say something about the difference in temperament between Weronika and Vronique. Weronika is cheerful, effervescent, restless, and childlike (especially as dubbed by Anna Gornostaj) and her offer of help to the old woman expresses her youthful high spirits and genuine good nature. Vronique is much more introspective, haunted by the loss of her mysterious other half as shown in the two love making scenes which should be times of joy, but which are actually times of anguish, the first coinciding with Weronikas burial and the second with the discovery of the photo of Weronika by Alexandre. Love making is about two people uniting, but here Vronique is alone and vulnerable in both cases. Her image out of the window (its not certain it is out of the window for the texture of the image has a disconnected daydream quality) is of an old woman walking, but Vronique does nothing except look and contemplate. Enigma also continues over the mysterious stern woman with hat who looks at Weronika scowling at the fact that she has won the singing audition, and then reappears later in the Gare St. Lazare in Paris staring at Vronique twice (once standing and then later sitting) as she tries to find the caf where Alexandre hopefully is waiting for her.

Engima and fantasy hover most obviously over the way Alexandre engineers Vroniques tryst with him, and is the point at which skeptics may well walk away from the film. A heavy-breathing phone call and then the Budenmajer music (how does he know her phone number? How does he know the significance of the Budenmajer?) is followed by Vronique getting a shoe lace in the mail (What is the possibility she would immediately link the lace with a short story he has written?), strong flickering light refracted into her face as she wakes up in her room which suggests the butterfly of the short story his puppet play was about as well as of course the spirit of Weronika (But how could he know that?), and then the receipt of a tape with ambient noise of (it turns out) Paris Gare St. Lazare where Vronique eventually goes and discovers him having waited over 48 hours sitting in a caf. All of this is very far-fetched and we only have two threads to really guide us  Vroniques belief that she is fulfilling her spiritual destiny, that Alexandre is her soul partner whom she has been yearning for all her life and then Alexandres machinations as over-arching artist creator. This is where intuition gives way to intellect and it becomes clear that what Kielowski has given here is as intensely metaphysical as it is whimsically fanciful.

In the caf it emerges that Alexandre has gone to great trouble to lure Vronique out in order to prove a theorem so that he can write a book about it. He proves to himself that it is possible to write a story based on a female character meeting her destiny through intuition alone. Then at the very end of the film Alexandre is shown making two puppets in the image of Vronique and he makes clear to her that he is going to use her life story not only in a book, but in a puppet play as well. The puppet play is to be entitled The Double Life of, the name not being decided yet, but of course we and Vronique know. I would suggest that both the book and the puppet play are metaphors for the film we are watching and that Alexandre is a doppelgnger for the films artistic creator, Kielowski himself. This makes the whole film a piece of meta-fiction in which the artist manipulates absolutely everything we see to depict in binary terms his own universe which is one based on chance, choices made and choices ignored and the inter-relationship between the two. Most obviously, this explains the films emphasis on each element of the film-making process and the heightened artificiality inherent in that. The film looks artificial (the gold lens filter coating each frame in false luminance constantly tells us we are watching a film), sounds artificial (note especially the way Budenmajers/Preisners concert piece is electronically distorted as the soprano voice soars upwards to the conductors visable amazement just before Weronikas collapse) and feels artificial. The story is outwardly preposterous and the careful binary presentation of two worlds, two countries, two people, suggests the creators hands are forever hovering over events, guiding, manipulating and defining both the story and us in the audience. Most obvious here is the puppet show which is in effect a film-within-a-film as Alexandre presents his story which he (being Kielowski himself) deliberately makes a metaphor for Vroniques own life experience. Kielowski has said it was very important for him that the puppeteers hands remain visable throughout and Bruno Schwarz was chosen because he is one of the few puppeteers who believe in not hiding his hands. This insistence on the visability of hands underlines Kielowskis intention to present his film as if manipulated by a higher force. The identity of this higher force is clearly shown by the films later scene in his studio where Alexandre wraps Vronique from behind, playing one of his Vronique dolls in front of her (hands clearly visable) as the second Vronique (Weronika of course) lies dead on the table.

On an even larger scale of course this films over-arching artist creator is none other than God Himself, and that is probably the level on which those with Faith will read it. Certainly the opening and closing images of sky (stars) and nature (leaves/trees) frame a universe arranged in binary order and there are images and scenes which can be linked with religion. The quick camera movement over the heads of members of the audience after Weronikas collapse strongly suggest her spirit taking flight having been released from the body that once contained it. The words of Budenmajers orchestral setting are taken from Dantes Divine Comedy (Paradiso, II, 1-9). Vronique is visited by Weronikas spirit not only in the music, but also in poetic images, for example a ghost-like image of Weronikas head singing and collapsing at the end of Alexandres phone call. The butterfly rising from the dead puppet could be an angel, perhaps Vroniques guardian angel who tells her what [she has] to do. Also there are references to churches and the image of Krakw cathedral. We should be careful though not to be too literal as an ambiguous image near the films beginning demonstrates. A giant statue is dragged by a truck, the figure standing with one arm raised as if to bless. Is this image Marx or Jesus? Poland being a Communist as well as Catholic country, it could be both as the backlighting deliberately makes it hard for us to tell. Kielowski is actually on record as being agnostic and tempting as it is to read the films spiritualism religiously, we should remember that spiritualism doesnt have to be connected with God, or a belief in God. New Age spiritualism separates one from the other and the film can be read both ways, the over-arching artistic creator finally being unquantifiable and unknowable. This is finally Kielowskis point I guess. He doesnt want to get specific. More simply he just wants to approach that inner spiritual life that lays inside all of us whether we have Faith or not. He says, The realm of superstitions, fortune telling, intuition, dreams, all this is the inner life of a human being, and all this is the hardest thing to film. Even though I know that it cant be filmed however hard I try, the simple fact is that Im taking this direction to get as close to this as my skill allows[the] goal is to capture what lies within us, but theres no way of filming it. You can only get nearer to it.

Theres no question in my mind that Kielowski is one of the greatest film directors of the last 30 years or so and The Double Life of Vronique is one of his most outstanding achievements. Set squarely in two countries, it marks the transition in his career from Polish film maker to international director. Some have said he betrays his roots here, but I think the films many connections with his past work disprove this. The idea of a character defining his/her life by making a choice with the possible outcomes lingering on and affecting this choice was first used in Blind Chance (1982), while the idea of the dead affecting the lives of the living from beyond the grave had been announced in No End (1984). That was the film which marked the first collaboration between Kielowski, Piesiewicz and Preisner, and Kielowskis focus on metaphysical matters from that time on in Dekalog (1988) and in the Three Colors Trilogy (1993-94) is largely put down to this three-way partnership, especially (I would say) Piesiewicz who was the originator of all these projects. The Double Life of Vronique emanated out of an episode of Dekalog 9 which briefly features an outstanding girl soprano who has to give up her career because of her heart condition. On Dekalog it was agreed between Kielowski and Piesiewicz to cut out anything about the internal politics of Poland in view of the series being set for international distribution. The Double Life of Vronique continues the stress on metaphysics over politics, though there is still a Solidarity demonstration scene which Weronika perhaps pointedly walks away from, and the scene gets its binary reflection in the exploding car scene outside the caf in the Gare St. Lazare, without which Vronique certainly would never have found Alexandre who had captured the sound of the explosion on the audio tape sent to her. That this film is an extraordinarily addictive and hypnotic experience owes a lot to all the various elements of the film-making process. Clearly Kielowski, Piesiewicz and Preisner all excel themselves as they did in everything from No End right through to the directors unfortunate early death, but I want to end with Irne Jacob. Present in every scene and the luminous light of the whole film, it would be impossible to imagine this film without her. She renders the two roles with such breathtaking range and skill. The childlike innocent Weronika is perfectly contrasted with her haunted introspective Vronique and we see the added load on her character with such clarity. Just to choose one example, the way she reacts at the end to the realization that Alexandre is using her story for his puppet show is so convincing. In her eyes we see very clearly the disillusionment and the pain that she is going through. With a performance less nuanced than hers, this film would have fallen as flat as a pancake. As it is the film is a beautiful miracle.

NB: I am reviewing a Tartan video tape which I transcribed to DVD by myself. It features the American ending which Miramaxs Harvey Weinstein insisted on. Apparently the original ending was deemed unclear, the fact that the guy cutting wood is Vroniques father and that she has driven home are left opaque for American viewers. Kielowski was obliged to shoot three extra shots  of the father coming out, a long shot of Vronique getting out of the car and running to him, and then the final image of the two hugging shot from inside the house, actually with a mirror to one side so that we see two couples hugging. Kielowski has gone public saying he doesnt object to this new ending so we also shouldnt object I suppose. But I prefer the ending with the sky and the tree - doubling with the films very opening images it just makes so much more sense. It looks like the Criterion DVD/Blu-ray version is the one to get. That features the original ending with the American one as an option. It also features three short films (Factory [1970], Hospital [1976], Railway Station [1980]) and a commentary by Annette Insdorf, author of the book Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kielowski. I cant comment on the Artificial Eye release.",1462838400,,21073,4.840221914008322

Whether it resulted in universe/dimension conflict in which the now awared one had to disappear or a sort of symbolism that with the new found knowledge she could no longer carry on as before, it's revealed she had a heart condition and she died while reaching the climax of the song she sang. That's in stark contrast to the beginning of the movie before the knowledge encounter, she's able to carry the song to the end with total exhilaration.

The tender and thought-provoking artistic images (the film begins with one child discovering the stars, the other a leaf), the puzzles that can lead to light bulb moments (""so they're Doppelgangers, are they?), intensely personal intimacy (the rain scatters a chorus while one girl continues to sing) mixed with wry detached humor (was that a flasher?), the admirable moral health of the filmmaker in moments that bring everything back down to earth (I call them ""Kieslowski moments""), and above all, of course, the very human feelings behind his work.

This film is not as tightly constructed as the Three Colors films, but all the artist's great strengths are on display for those who enjoy them, even if, for some, at a too leisurely pace.

3244419,5,B000XXWE1M,"I've been a fan of Krzysztof Kieslowski for a while now without having really seen many of his films.  In fact, I'd seen a total of four before sitting down to watch `The Double Life of Veronique' and I was still utterly spellbound by the very mention of his name.  I remember quite vividly the first time I saw `No End' and it was like the end all for me.  There was no coming back from that.  Kieslowski became one of my favorite filmmakers with just a single film.  But with each film I do see my view of his craft is only enriched because each film is THAT good.

`The Double Life of Veronique' is, at the moment, my favorite.

First of all, the film is a technical marvel.  From the splendid performances (Irene Jacob is a revelation in dual roles that complete one another spectacularly) to the rich set pieces and the colorful use of framing each scene to the glorious operatic score and the languid way in which the film progresses forward, `The Double Life of Veronique' is one of those films you WANT to look at.  The film is gorgeous.  More than that though, the film says something so compelling and so profound about the way we see life in general and I can't help but continue to go back to this film as a tent pole of sorts; a film that defines what film should be about.

Basically, the story told is of two woman who share a similar identity, not to mention the same appearance.  Weronika is a Polish singer with a heart condition.  Veronique is a French music teacher who also suffers from a heart condition.  When Weronika dies, Veronique feels it in her soul, but it is a feeling she cannot explain.  Her life takes on a different shape, a different meaning, and while she tries to move forward she can't help but feel in the back of her mind and in the pit of her soul that something is different.  The connection between the women is never explained and the hinting of a parallel life shared between two souls is given brief light as Veronique mentions always feeling that there was another part of her somewhere, that she is not alone in the world.

What is so wonderful about this prose and the way that Kieslowski manages to maintain the ambiguity within the film's climax is that it allows the audience to explore a part of themselves they may normally leave untapped.  The spiritual aspects of the film are highlighted by the way in which these two lives are interwoven and the beautiful cinematography envelopes each scene in this mysterious light that personifies the themes being broached here.

The idea of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu has been flirted with in the past and will continue to be, but I found the way that `The Double Life of Veronique' attempts to convey that very same feeling without being obvious or literal in the process to be the most effective.  Maybe spiritualists believe in the afterlife and or the existence of a parallel spirit or dimension or alternate self and the reincarnation belief is one that has been around for ages.  While never specifically mentioning any of the above, `The Double Life of Veronique' raises awareness to the possibility that we are not alone and no matter what medium you believe to be responsible for that duality it becomes apparent that Krzysztof's voice is one worth listening to.",1345161600,,3263,4.562607204116638
3244420,2,B000XXWE1M,"The images in this movie are beautiful and the music is quite beautiful too. And the lead-actress really does play well. Yet, this does not make it a good movie.

There is repeatedly a kind of mystification which seems inappropriate to me.
If there is no obvious story or plot, this need not be a problem; but this movie lacks authenticity, if you ask me. The movie is phantasy/imagination-driven, psychologically it is not realistic or mature; and I do not sense true inspiration or depth.

Alienation is an important theme in this movie, but it is not really solved or confronted.
Sex and intimacy is no solution.
Beauty for beauty's sake is no solution.
An art-movie without depth or primary-authentic inspiration is also no solution either.

Yet the images and music, and the puppetshow-scene, make this movie certainly worth watching.",1339804800,,839,4.978571428571429
3244421,5,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life of Veronique (1991)
Drama, Fantasy, Music, 98 minutes, French and Polish Language
Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski
Starring Irene Jacob and Philippe Volter

The Double Life of Veronique sparks all kinds of thoughts, makes me cry, and leaves me feeling like I entered another world.

The film is probably the most beautiful I have ever seen. The color palette is rich and places an emphasis on reds, greens and yellows. There are many instances of images viewed through things which distort reality: a clear plastic ball, mirrors, windows, reflections in glass and also a magnifying glass.

Music is a huge part of the experience, whether it's happening in the story or part of the soundtrack.

The first 30 minutes of the story concerns Weronika. She is Polish and a gifted singer. Weronika is so in tune with life that it's painful. When she sings, there is pure joy visible on her face. She ignores outside distractions such as pouring rain because she's so caught up in the moment. She makes love the same way.

***Spoiler Alert***

Unfortunately, Weronika has a heart problem and drops dead while performing at a recital.

The film switches locations and we find ourselves in France with Veronique. She appears identical to Weronika and both women are played by Irene Jacob. Veronique seems to sense Weronika's death, although she can't pinpoint why she is feeling a sense of loss.

This is a film about connections and feelings. Are we alone in the world or are there people somewhere just like us? Do we share any kind of connection? Is any of this controlled by some higher power, or are events simply random? The ""coincidences"" in this film are too frequent for everything to be random, aren't they? Room 287, a plastic ball, a ring, a shoestring, loving fathers and absent mothers, and probably a few things that I completely missed.

Kieslowski doesn't tell us what any of this means. We don't know whether the two women are related or twins separated at birth. It doesn't really matter why any of this happens. The film is intended to make us think and feel, and it succeeds very well.

I often wonder whether Jean-Pierre Jeunet was thinking of Veronique when he created Amelie. Although one is completely serious and one is a comedy, both contain elaborate scenes in which one character encourages another to seek them out. France features in both films and the color palette's are similar.

I can't make a sweeping recommendation. This is the kind of film for people who like to contemplate the meaning of life and their own existence. The narrative meanders along and there are no clear answers or startling resolutions to the story. It just is.",1330473600,,2675,4.831509846827133

3244423,5,B000XXWE1M,"Kieslowski's The Double Life of Veronique is a unique film that's quite difficult to explain if you haven't see it. The story follows two women: polish singer Weronika and french teacher Veronique. While both don't know about the existence of the other, they share a mystical connection that's reinforced by the use of colors, filters and music. Both women are played by Irene Jacob which is superb in the dual role. Contrary of what the title suggests, this is not a mystery thriller about the women finding each other. No, this film is about loss, liberty, freedom, duality, love, destiny and more. Kieslowski shows us a surreal connection that are reinforced by beautiful shots. This film is more about feeling than understanding. When you watch it, you experience a diverse of emotions even if you don't quite understand what's going on. Never has been a film like this one before or after and only reinforces the fact that Kieslowski was truly a unique director. Veronique is a beautiful, superb film. A classic.

Video & Audio
Veronique comes to BD courtesy of Criterion and as you might expect, the results are superb. The image is immaculate boasting well defined colors, strong contrast and amazing detail. There are no signs of damage, artifacting or any other compression issues. A spectacular transfer.

Likewise, the 2.0 DTS-HD MA is pretty strong with no signs of hiss or damage. Dialogue and music is always clear and directionality is well done. A great audio presentation.

3244426,5,B000XXWE1M,"Vibrant, colorful, symbiotic and ambiguous, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a wonderful arthouse film that continues to resonate strongly 20-years later and a highlight in the career of Polish director and screenwriter Krzysztof Kie'lowski's cinema oeuvre.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a 1991 French and Polish film and a pre-cursor to Kieslowski's color trilogy (""Three Colors: Blue, Red and White) and known for the TV mini-series ""The Decalogue"" which captured audiences for its artistic style, considering it was a TV mini-series, preceded by three more Kieslowski films that received rave reviews in 1988, ""A Short Film About Love"",  ""A Shot Film About Killing"" and in 1981 for ""Blind Chance"".

The film won ""Best Actress"", ""FIPRESCI Prize"" and ""Prize of the Ecumenical Jury"" at the Cannes International Film Festival and was also nominated for a Golden Palm Award.  Also winning an award for ""Best Music"" by the Los Angeles Film Critics"" and ""Best Foreign Language Film"" by the National Society of Film Critics Awards.

While the film was praised for its symbolic and artistic quality, for the US release, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax requested an alternate ending and thus the US version of the film had an extra four scenes at the end.

But what ""The Double Life of Veronique"" would feature is a concept of doppelgangers, a fantasy element that is not explained but it is part of the film.  But what is amazing about the film is its cinematography as it uses color and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere where greens, yellows, oranges, reds and blacks are featured strongly throughout the film.  A style which cinematographer Slawomir Idziak would experiment on ""The Decalogue"" and would become used in this film and used heavily in Kieslowski's ""Color"" trilogy.

VIDEO:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is presented in 1:66:1 and looks magnificent on Blu-ray.  Detail is much more evident as you can see the cracks of the walls to the skin bumps on Irene Jacob's naked skin.  The colors also pop with no sight of banding.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep. As mentioned earlier, the color filters and what was accomplished by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak is quite amazing.  The filters create an ethereal dreamlike look for the film and if you thought the film looked great on DVD, on Blu-ray, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" looks spectacular.

On 4:3 televisions, the images will appear letterboxed.  On standard and widescreen televisions, black bars may also be visible on the left and right to maintain the proper screen format.

According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer was created using a 35mm negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is presented in stereo.  Dialogue and music can be heard clearly! The score by Zbigniew Preisner is wonderful and comes alive through the lossless stereo track but if anything captured me was hearing the operatic voice (not sure if that was truly Irene Jacob's voice but it was divine!).

According to the Criterion Collection, the stereo soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the 35-mm magnetic tracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools D.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

Included is a 46-page booklet featuring ""Through the Looking Glass"" by Jonathan Romney and ""Pure Emotions: The Double Life of Veronique from Kie'lowski on Kie'lowski"". (Note: ""The Forced Choice of Freedom"" by Slavoj Zizek and ""Kieslowski's Muse"" by Peter Cowie which were in the 2006 DVD release booklet are not included in the Blu-ray release booklet).

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is quite an intriguing film.  Many critics and viewers have various interpretations of the film... From the two women symbolizing their countries, the women symbolizing the life of Kie'lowski and others feeling it deals with the doppelganger mythology and more.

There is an ambiguity that Kie'lowski knew that people who watched the film, would experience and interpret it differently.  And it's what he wanted to do as a filmmaker.  In fact, knowing that this film would be showing in various theaters, his goal was to slightly change the film for each theater,  ""The Double Life of Veronique"" would be a different experience for a viewer, with some scenes running shorter or longer, ending would be happy or sad but in the end, they ran out of time and were only able to create two versions, with the second version being the US release with a few scenes added to the request made by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein.

There is no doubt that this is one of those films that arthouse fans love for its cinematic creativity.  The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is magnificent.  The use of the filters in Kie'lowski's words, ""to create a beautiful world, more than it is"".  But for others, the film may be too ambiguous for their tastes.  But it is what made Kie'lowski's work so unique and untethered.  Although he worked in co-productions, his films were his own.  He made the call, he made the cuts and the integrity of the film of what he wanted remained intact.

But there are scenes that are symbolic, there are scenes which one must be focused on too pickup the various clues that Kie'lowski leaves with the viewers.  From Weronika pulling on a shoestring which resembles an EKG monitor and seeing the string snap off.  There is a scene in Veronique's storyline in which her small crystal ball shows an image of buildings which were the buildings that Weronika's father was drawing, and a small ball that Weronika also carries.  There is a scene where Weronika looks at her photo after making love and seeing the opposite with Veronique.

The film showcases this mysterious connection but it doesn't focus on it.  While many Hollywood films on the mystical are treated with storylines answering questions of ""why is it possible?"", Kie'lowski's film answers back with a ""why should I answer that?"".

In many ways, the film can be seen like poetry, like a painting.  The film relies on ambiance and mood for narrative, in fact Weronika/Veronique's dialogue is quite minimalistic, as the film is ethereal and allows the viewer to come up with their own answers to what the film may be about.

I've met people who felt that Weronika succumbs to the doppelganger effect (a myth which is about a person who comes across their exact self, their doppelganger, the result is that they will die).  But there are those who go deeper into the storyline and feel that ""The Double Life of Veronique"" examines humanity and possibly may symbolize countries.  If both countries have a connection and are very much alike, do they have free will or is someone higher pulling their strings. Others have felt there was a religious connection (although God or religion is not mentioned in the film), I have read those who felt there was a Christian-link to the film when it comes to spirituality.

Some may feel there is a symbolism with a political nature due to Kieslowski's past films, while others feel the film is about something deeper.  Nevertheless, this is where the efficacy of the film works, with the fact that people have their own interpretation of what the film is about and what they imagine the film to be.

This was Kieslowski's style, to never discuss what he was trying to accomplish with the film, to let the viewers have their say on how a film meant to them.

For me, I have watched this film several times and each time, I manage to pick up on things that I didn't see previously.  In fact, this is a film that does require multiple viewings, not for the sake of understanding the story but as I mentioned before, it's like a painting.  It has simplicity, but it can also be interpreted as complex.  Kie'lowski is the creator, does his past and what he had created in his past films or documentary work have something to say about his work of art?  What are the symbolic meanings of the objects of the film?  These questions is what makes the film so intriguing that you want to watch it again.

As for the acting, the acting was wonderful.  Irene Jacob did a fantastic job in playing the role of two women.  She is able to embody the emotions felt by both women, from happiness, sadness and it looks natural and believable.  And I will say that if it that is Jacob's voice during those operatic scenes, my respect for her as a multi-talented actress has increased and found her performance to be ingratiating.

As for the Blu-ray release of ""The Double Life of Veronique"", let me first say that the 2006 DVD release from The Criterion Collection was magnificent.  And with the 2010 Blu-ray release in Europe ala Artificial Eye, there was no doubt in my mind that this title would receive a Blu-ray release courtesy of Criterion.  The 2011 Blu-ray looks absolutely beautiful in HD and of course, with the ability to go to index for the commentary quite easily is a plus.  But it is important for me to say that the original 2006 DVD release does have more content (in the booklet) and of course, the DVD release had an awesome package.

So, the big question for those who own the previous 2006 DVD release is if it's worth owning on Blu-ray.  The answer is yes if you want the improved picture quality and lossless stereo track.  But if you don't have a 1080p HD TV or a proper home theater setup for lossless audio, then it's a moot point, there is no need to upgrade.  Otherwise, if you do have the proper home theater setup, then yes because the film looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray,  The details of the film are much more evident, every crack on the walls can be seen, even the skin bumps on actress Irene Jacob can be seen very clearly.

Overall, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a magnificent film from director Krzysztof Kie'lowski and the Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection is wonderful.  I will say that the original 2006 DVD had a wonderful package presentation and the addition of more content in the booklet made it a perfect release and if you own that DVD release, I highly recommend on keeping it.  But for those who don't own the film or those wanting to upgrade to Blu-ray, especially for those who are used to watching arthouse films, especially Kie'lowski films, will find ""The Double Life of Veronique"" to be a release worth owning especially as it is a film that requires multiple viewing.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is a beautiful film!

Highly recommended!",1300233600,,12137,4.916420845624385
3244427,5,B000XXWE1M,"Visionary, beautiful, touching and thoughtful, this movie has moved me deeply for years.  Irene Jacob is luminous as the two leads and Kieslowski is at his subtexty thematic best.  Finally offered in the US in a Criterion special edition and on  BluRay.  All of Kieslowski's work (especially the three colors trilogy) deserves this treatment.  He was one of the best European filmmakers to guide you on examining your own soul while sharing a bit of his.",1293580800,,454,4.921052631578948
3244428,5,B000XXWE1M,"I've read through most of the reviews on this page. The majority of the Amazon reviewers pretty much gave a detailed and thorough summary and review of ""The Double Life of Veronique"", so I don't need to be redundant or rehash what these reviewers have written. The main reason why I'm writing is because I feel that Krzysztof Kieslowski was one of the most important, talented, deep, creative, artistic, soul-searching director geniuses of all time. If I had to travel back in time, I would want to meet and have conversations with Krzysztof Kieslowski, President Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Mother Teresa, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, etc. Kieslowski's films have made a major impact on my life. His films have always brought great comfort to me because he felt things so deeply and saw symbolism in a lot of things like I do. In my humble opinion, the best films in the world are the kinds that make you feel deeply emotional from beginning to end and that make you think days, weeks, months, years after the movie ends. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" was released in the U.S. in late 1991 when I was a freshman at an undergraduate university. I have seen artistic and thought-provoking films such as the films I saw when I took a Soviet Cinema class in college and viewed movies such as Mikhail Kalatozov's ""The Cranes are Flying"", Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"", ""Stalker"", and ""Andrei Rublev"", Sergei Eisentein's ""Battleship Potemkin"", and Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"". From that Soviet Cinema class, my favorite was Sergei Parajanov's ""The Color of Pomegranates"". Parajanov's film was an extraordinarily different and artistic cinematic experience. You have to feel, think, and see the symbolism in Parajanov's films. And I once had a boyfriend who said he didn't get it and said he was bored with ""The Color of Pomegranates"", even though I was the opposite, and thought it was a surreal experience to watch the film. You can't have a short attention span when you watch films like this. I like films that have symbolism and that make you pay attention to details from beginning to end. And you need to pay attention from beginning to end with Krzysztof Kieslowski's films. Kieslowski is my favorite director of all time because he uses every element to make you feel haunting, deep, intense emotions. I've never seen a director incorporate light, symbolism, music, objects like he does. I really do believe that this man is the most clever director. Everything means something when you watch his films. My sister and I love watching his work. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" impacted me so much that I bought the star rubber ball that Irene Jacob uses in the film when I was in college. Who knew that you can view the world in a different way with a star rubber ball? Who knew that Veronique would see the same buildings that Weronika saw through her star rubber ball? I can't repeat how genius Kieslowski was! It's like he thought about every scene and every prop and object he used, yet it looks so effortless at the same time. I've never seen a director put so much thought into things yet made it look so easy and like it was meant to be. After watching ""The Double of Veronique"" or any of Kieslowski's films, you'll never look at children's books, shoelaces, cigar boxes, cassette tapes, puppets, ring, old people walking on the street carrying bags or recycling stuff, flashes of light, or music in the same way. For anyone who has the Zodiac sign of the Gemini like me, ""The Double Life of Veronique"" holds special meaning. I relate to both the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique. There's a weak, fragile side to me and a stronger side to me. Right now, I'm going through some health problems, so I'm experiencing the Polish Weronika side now. Weird as it sounds, I've always felt that there was somebody else, another part of me, that was stronger and had more luck health-wise on the other side of this Earth. Even though it's tragic what happened to Weronika, her life being cut short with her heart problems, the other ""twin"", Veronique goes to check her heart problems in the Cardiology Department. While Weronika works hard and realizes she is suffering from heart problems she continues to sing until she dies unexpectedly while Veronique seems to sense something and uses caution and says she no longer wants to sing. The scene where Veronique stretches the shoelace on top of her ECG/EKG (heart rate) page was genius. That one scene was ""symbolic"" of the tie she had with Weronika - Weronika's heart failed, while Veronique's didn't. Some people have luck on their side, and some people don't. And this film perfectly illustrates that. This film provides much comfort to me because it's like Kieslowski is telling us that we all are going to die whether young or old. We see the young Weronika die, and we see the old person walking on the street (In my opinion, Kieslowski's awareness of death approaching). In summary, we need to come to terms with the luck of the draw and the fate that has been handed to us. And that even though you have died (the Polish Weronika), a part of you (the French Veronique) lives on and the world goes on. It's because of Kieslowski that I have come to terms with some of the bad luck that happened to me at a young age which affected my health. Kieslowski's films have taught me to learn to have more peace in my life and to not fear the bad things in life. Kieslowski's films have truly taught me to not fear death and mortality. Yes, that's how amazing and important Krzysztof Kieslowski was. Irene Jacob does an excellent job in this film playing the dual roles. And Zbigniew Preisner does an amazing job with the music as usual. I love how Kieslowski has worked with Irene Jacob and Zbigniew Preisner in more than film. It shows how loyal and trusting he was. I truly believe this world would be a much better place if more people watched Kieslowski's ""Three Colors Trilogy"", ""The Decalogue"" series, and ""The Double Life of Veronique"". I can't repeat enough how genius and awesome Kiewslowski was! If my memory is correct, when I saw the movie ""Blue"", Juliette Binoche's character moves out of the house, and carries a box that is holding the blue glass ceiling fixture from her daughter's room, and the box says ""Blanco"", meaning the color ""White"", which was the next film in the trilogy. In the movie ""Red"", the old, retired judge lives alone and made the wrong romantic choice when he was younger. The young judge in the movie is going on the same path as the old judge by falling for the wrong woman and fate intervenes and he is with the right woman, Irene Jacob. The old, retired judge then finds some peace seeing the young judge with the right woman. In a way, you can find parallels in ""Red"" and ""The Double Life of Veronique"". Life didn't turn out perfect for Weronika or the old, retired judge, but there is peace found when better luck and better choices are made from Veronique and the young judge's side. In a way, you feel complete when you watch Kieslowski's films. He shows you what it's like on both sides of the spectrum. He shows you what it looks like to take one path and what it looks like to take the other path. Anyways, I strongly and highly recommend ""The Double Life of Veronique"" and any film that Krzysztof Kieslowski has ever made. I really mean it when I say that you're really missing out if you haven't watched or bought one Krzysztof Kieslowski film. I have truly become a better human being knowing that Kieslowski had true empathy and understanding about humanity and the true, deep, important meaning of life. For instance in ""Red"", the young, Irene Jacob, works in the end harmoniously with the old, Jean-Louis Trintignant. You see Irene Jacob help an old person recycle in ""Red"". In a way, Kieslowski was sending the message that both the old and the young can help and learn from each other. And I feel that many people will truly become enlightened human beings after watching any of Kieslowski's films.",1290816000,,8033,4.693834160170092
3244429,5,B000XXWE1M,"Two identical women in two different countries, living lives that mirror one another. When one dies, what is left?

Krzysztof Kieslowski produced one of his finest films is ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (""La Double vie de Vronique""). It's not just a philosophical, artistic film, but a subtle and unique tale full of Kieslowski's exquisitely detailed direction. And of course, it gives Irne Jacob a chance to shine in her most challenging role.

There are two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique (both played by Irne Jacob). They have never met, never spoken, and do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer.

What is more, each has the strange feeling that she is, somehow, not alone in the world. One night, Weronika dies onstage while singing. Suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling, and stops taking her lessons. Weronika has died, but she still lives. Soon she begins to explore, searching for the truth about her double life, and a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.

""The Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that just begs to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? About fate? Sacrifice? Love? One woman's soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols and metaphors can be unwound any which way, and in the end they all work.

Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art. He dots ""Double Life"" with plenty of little hints about the inner states of the characters. The stars and leaves, for example, hint at the personalities of Weronika and Veronique -- one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.

At times this film seems like a love letter on film to Irne Jacob. Not only is she followed constantly by the camera, but her character is difficult but rewarding. Jacob shines without really seeming to, with the emotion and wonder of a small child in an adult body. Philippe Volter's aura of mystery adds to his excellent acting in his too-brief scenes. Unfortunately, few of the other characters are given much dimension -- the whole focus is on Weronika and Veronique.

Like other Criterion blu-ray releases, this has the same sort of extras -- audio commentary, three short documentary films, a short film by Kieslowski's mentor, a documentary with behind-the-scemes stuff and interview, another documentary examining Kieslowski's career, an interview with Jacob, and some essays. Be informed: the blu-ray will include FEWER essays than the regular DVD booklet.

This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpret it as you will, but it's undeniable that Kieslowski's ""Double Life of Veronique"" is exquisite.",1289865600,,3218,5.058490566037736
3244430,5,B000XXWE1M,"Director Krzysztof Kieslowski has left us many cinematic jewels but The Double Life of Veronique may be his finest. Some reviewers see the film as an allegory of Poland's relationship to Western Europe; an interesting interpretation although it does not seem Kieslowski had this directly in mind.

Swiss actress Irene Jacob is absolutely mesmerizing in dual roles as the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique. I have never witnessed a more stunning performance by an actress; delicate, sensitive, and beautiful beyond compare. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is heaven-like. Zbigniew Preisner's score is gorgeous.

My compliments to Criterion for the multitude of interesting and entertaining bonus features that are part of this release:

-Excellent commentary provided by Kieslowski biographer, Annette Insdorf.

-The ending made especially for the U.S. theatrical release.

-Kieslowski documentaries Factory (1970), Hospital (1976), and Railway Station (1980) as well as the documentary Musicians by Kieslowski's mentor, Kazimierz Karabasz.

3244431,5,B000XXWE1M,"Irene Jacob is exceptionally captivating playing the dual role of Veronika, an aspiring Polish soprano, and Veronique, a French music teacher. The Double Life of Veronique is a highly cerebral story of two people who feel a profound connection with someone they do not know and have never met. We first meet Veronika in Poland: singing in a choir, meeting a lover, auditioning. She wakes up one evening from a strange dream, gasping, and tells her father that she believes she is not alone. She begins to suffer bouts of breathlessness. During her debut performance, she collapses on stage. We then meet Veronique in Paris: teaching music to young students, watching a puppet show, visiting her father at his country estate. When Veronique begins to receive mysterious packages from an unknown admirer, she believes that she is deeply in love, and that the source is the answer that would fill the inexplicable and sudden void in her life. However, as with life, illusion may be more intriguing, but proves fleeting. What remains is a profound revelation that leads her to an inevitable conclusion and closure.

The Double Life of Veronique is a highly provocative film that examines a soul's search for identity and connection. Kieslowski uses a sepia overlay on the film to create a monochromatic, almost ethereal atmosphere. The suffusive darkness achieved by this technique is a manifestation of the mystical and dreamlike elements of the story (note the similar effect achieved in Agnieszka Holland's Olivier, Olivier). As in Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, the visual otherworldliness of the film is a representation of the exploration of the subconscious. Note the elements of fairy tales and vivid dreams in the film. The unfolding of the story is elliptical and obscure, as if the protagonist is reluctantly waking from a sweet, intangible dream. In fact, she is.",1262736000,,1868,5.1245901639344265
3244432,4,B000XXWE1M,"Throughout his career director Krsysztof Kieslowski worked as a documentary film maker, before doing his doing his most memorable works on film.

His movies offer recurring themes such as coincidences, reverbation, connection, and even parallel lives, and deliver a compelling fly on the wall look at human existence. With Veronique and his famous Blue, White and Red Trilogy, he has crafted some of the most visually memorable movies you will see.  In fact, I saw this movie after seeing it recommended on Roger Ebert's website.

It is a simple truth, universally acknowledged that there is little in the world more beautiful and affecting than a beautiful woman in her pristine prime.  So it is with Veronique affectingly portrayed by Irene Jacob.

Not only do see her in wonder, in bemusement, and nude and being made love to, like the camera in love with it's object, it's like we step into that life and see the things we would not normally see with an all seeing eye. This is how this movie excels as a work of art.  We get to know who she is by how she is.

The only weakness I find is with the story and the characterisation.  While Irene Jacob is a compelling presence, the other characters and the story do not develop particularly well.

A little disturbing is the introduction of the puppeteer, a somewhat shadowy and mysterious character, with somewhat of a stalker like obsession with French Veronique.  He sends a shoelace through the mail.
Does he represent some sort of all knowing intelligence, and are his intentions towards her actually good?  The sequence where he makes love to her while she is sad, could be interpreted a number of ways.

I find Irene Jacob fascinating, and she did another movie with Kiezlowski called Red.  I consider that a much better movie, it tells a story, and draws parallels between the old judge and the young man, and I would call Red a masterful work. Red is part of a trilogy, yet it is a stand alone movie. It also garnered three Oscar nominations.  Unfortunately, Red proved to be his last movie.  I do recommend both movies.",1244073600,,2080,4.707182320441989
3244433,5,B000XXWE1M,I fear that using words to try and describe the great essence of this film won't do it proper justice. I will restrict myself by only saying that this film is perfection on screen. Kieslowski was a true master...,1239667200,,212,4.461538461538462
3244434,5,B000XXWE1M,"Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski made a dozen or so quality films, but beginning with The Double Life of Veronique, he suddenly catapulted into the artistic stratosphere inhabited by such greats as Fellini, Kurosowa, and Bergman. Starring Irene Jacob, whose acting is as superb as her beauty, the film is a complex metaphysical examination of twin souls briefly touching then parting and leaving only question marks. Jacob plays both roles, and Kieslowski moves at will between their two lives, sometimes with few visual clues. It may take several viewings to get their lives straight, but it is worth it. Long out of print, this film eluded me for about five years before I found a VHS tape, which I watched many times before it was released on DVD. If you like great filmmaking and don't mind subtitles, I highly recommend this film as I do Kieslowski's other masterpieces, the trilogy Blue, White, and Red, which are absolutely incredible films. (Jacob also stars in Red -- in my opinion the best of these three great films.) Though from Poland, Kieslowski made all of these films in French. Unfortunately, he passed away at the peak of his directorial powers.",1235433600,,1167,4.959183673469388
3244435,5,B000XXWE1M,"In the film, Veronique catches just a glimpse of her ""other self"" as a bus pulls away, but that glimpse raises the question: suppose the two Valentines actually did meet? Such a meeting would pose some fascinating questions, I think. And the possibility of such a meeting made me recall two wonderful pieces of fiction by the master Argentinean poet/philosopher/writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986). In two of his short stories such meetings actually do occur; ""The Other"" (from ""The Book of Sand"" - 1975) and ""August 25, 1983"" (from ""Shakespeare's Memory"" - 1983). Could Kieslowski have read these works?",1227744000,,605,5.121212121212121
3244436,4,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life Of Vronique (La Double Vie De Vronique) is the 1991 French-Polish film by Krzysztof Kieslowski, written by himself and Krzysztof Piesiewicz that was the presage for the greatness of the Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, and Red), and was an international sensation at both the Cannes and New York film festivals, for here is where the gilt-hazed camera work of Slawomir Idziak, the music of Zbigniew Preisner (although slyly credited to the fictional Van den Budenmayer in the film- a running joke within Kieslowski's later works), and Kieslowski's own vision first touched greatness- even if it is a conditional greatness, more of sensuality than sense. The film has been rhapsodized by international film critics as Kieslowski's `coming out' film, but one can see it is clearly a bridge between the direction he was headed with his tv series The Decalogue, and where he ended up in the Trilogy.
  The film is not linear, which is the first thing that separates it from the typical Hollywood, and even contemporary European, films, but there is a cloying coyness to the film's reliance on synchronicities and contrivances that is more pronounced than in the Trilogy, where the errors Kieslowski made here were modulated. A film, or any work of art, that has a number of interpretations is exciting, but one with unlimited interpretations is a cheat, and reeks of narrative laziness. The Double Life Of Vronique falls just short of going too far, but the relentless scenes of cogitation for the sake of cogitation- and revealing lead actress Irne Jacob's lovely face and body, border on the obsessive; which would not be a bad thing, considering a good portion of the film's tale is on that topic, but the plain fact is that there is nothing new brought to the table on said topic.
  Many critics have read so much nonsense into the film- such as the early death of Weronika absurdly representing Poland's absorption into the Soviet Bloc- in this most apolitical of films, that such readings only highlight the film's greatest failure- a lack of coherence. Yes, the film has to be given some latitude, narratively, but open endedness, to a fault, is still a fault. That Kiesloski did not repeat this in his later films is a recognition of this fact, and may explain his near obsessive need for tying up the ends of the Three Colors Trilogy in Red. Such things as how Alexandre got Weronika's possessions? Could he be the lover that Weronika was leaving Antek for? After all, he's famous and travels. Thus his later obsession with her twin, when he meets her, would have psychological resonance, as well as explain his stalking and sending of things. One can resist the temptation to figure out every last detail in a film like this, for much does not stand up to intellectual scrutiny, but to not ground the narrative in some bit of internal diegetic reality is to rob the film of its solid foundation.
  The Double Life Of Vronique ultimately misses greatness, if by a hair, because of these flaws- such as its too contrived, and lacking in chemistry, romance, for it often tries to force its implausible mystery at the viewer, rather than letting it evolve more subtly. In this way, its directed ending- even if more mysterious, is actually more in line with the Pulp Fiction sort of storytelling than that in the Three Colors Trilogy, which might explain why The Double Life Of Vronique was highly awarded, whereas Red lost out to Quentin Tarantino's convoluted yet plot driven film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. The ending, where Alexandre tells Vronique of his plan for a book similar to the film is simply too much, and such preciousness is a flaw in the screenplay by Kieslowski and Piesiewicz. One wonders what a greater screenwriter, like Bergman, could have done with these ideas. He certainly would have muted some of the obviousness, for even in Persona- another overrated, but greater, film, he does not go so far as to have the two aspects of what could be one person/persona played by a single actress. Thus, the film relies more on its strengths- which are undoubtedly great: the acting of the sensual yet innocent Jacob, and the evocative imagery, where the narrative's oneiric progression works best in its hermetic cosmos, crafting the dialogue of the two women from silence, even as the camera fixates on the radiant Jacob.
  I wonder if Kieslowski was aware of the scientific studies done on twins separated at birth, and if this fact influenced this film, even to the point that the two women were, indeed, twins- one adopted by a Polish family, and the other by a French family? Such a hint that this might be the case could be evinced through further watchings, which I shall engage in, and which might just raise this slyly intriguing cocktease of a film above the bar for greatness. Until that time, however, I am left with the critical truism that while the narrative interior of a film can get away with not being analyzed too closely, the same cannot always be said for its exterior workings. This is why the film left me with a lack, yet why I also will view it again. Sometimes success and failure can have the same result. Other times not. Just ask Weronika/Vronique.",1221782400,,5223,4.795555555555556
3244437,5,B000XXWE1M,"Director Krzysztof Kieslowski had previously explored the concept of multiple and parallel possibilities in life for the same person with his film, PRZYPADEK, (BLIND CHANCE) 1987, and with a brief subplot in the ninth episode of THE DECALOGUE (1990). With VERONIQUE, he probed deeper into the metaphysical probabilities in life, and postulated that each of us could, or might have a ""doppelganger"" out there, walking on this sphere just as we are, two almost identical parts of the same spiritual entity, and two separate but nearly identical souls. We can, or might be ""aware"" of that other presence, and we could share insights, instincts, fears, mishaps, dangers, and health issues.

Weronika (Irene Jacob) lived in Poland, a young woman still residing at home with her father. She has a fabulous natural singing voice, and is discovered one day by a famous music teacher--but she also has a cardiac condition that she does not deal with. Disregarding her heart problems, she launched into strenuous voice training, and plunged headlong into a fledgling career--but during what would have been a triumphant singing debut, she collapsed and died mid-performance.

We then are introduced to Veronique (Irene Jacob) who lived in France. She was a music teacher, who seemed to be taking singing lessons. She had recently returned from a trip to Poland, and without realizing it, she and Weronika had glimpsed each other while in the Great Square at Krakow. Weronika had seen Veronique clearly, although she made little of it. Veronique had snapped a photograph of Weronika without recognition of her. There is a myth that if we ever meet our doppelganger, one of us will die. Krieslowski seemed to subscribe to this notion.

Moments after Weronika's death, Veronique while making love suddenly felt a tremendous loss, an overwhelming sense of grief--somehow becoming aware that she was now ""alone"" in the world. She immediately contacted her singing teacher and cancelled her lessons, abandoned the notion of a singing career. This cross over of instinct or genetic knowledge was not explained--it is just presented.

Most of the film dealt with Veronique's life in France. She fell in love with a dashing and mysterious writer and puppeteer, who somehow seemed to ""understand"" the duality of her nature, and of her life. When he created two puppets, possibly representing this probability, Veronique fled from the relationship, fled from her full recognition of her special circumstance. It was if Weronika had ventured forth first on this firmament, like a fraternal twin, taking a breath mere minutes before the other. The choices she made for herself, however catastrophic, resulted somehow to serve as guidelines and considerations later for Veronique.

Kieslowski presented us several delicious overlapping and synchronicious symbols and objects that became the common warp and weave of the two lives in both countries--leaves, upside down imagery, landscapes, churches, colors, string, fathers, missing mothers, toys, and a weak heart among others; nothing overt yet still significant enough to reinforce our tingle of deju vu. There is a reoccurring character in both scenarios--a stern looking woman is a large hat; reminiscent of the angelic ""observer"" who appeared in most of the episodes of DECOLOGUE.

Kieslowski's universe was both Gnostic and existential, natural and surrealistic, mundane and nearly surreal at times--but there is no doubt that he led the way for many other film directors to explore to notions and philosophies he created. Many of us presently are less impressed with him than we should be, for we are inundated with CGI games that effortlessly offer us multiple choices for specific outcomes. We make one choice and our character is killed. We simply rewind, back up and start over, making another choice and hoping to emerge victorious, the master of our fantasy scenario. In the 1980's however this was a ""new"" twist, a new concept--the role of both chance and parallel histories.

THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE (1991) took Cannes and the world by storm in 1991--despite its nonsensical plot premise and unorthodox structure, liberally mixing non-linear and parallel storylines with metaphysical postulates. I feel that it is a classic, a barn burner, a trend setter, and it is not to be missed.",1204070400,,4330,5.230547550432276

Although oblivious to the other's existence, Veronika, an aspiring Polish soprano, and Vronique, a Parisian music teacher, gradually become aware that they are connected to a spiritual twin.

My Review:

His earliest film to date that undertakes the acting of Irne Jacob.

The themes embellished are of a deep mysterious balance of fate upon the lives of two women sharing more that several physical and psychological traits. It doesn't push the idea of them being linked by pure coincidence or a grander design, just touches on it and lets you decide for yourself.

The mosaic shots really do emphasise the warmth of the worlds inhabited by Veronika in Krakow and Vronique in Paris, with a score that balance them as much as each other. The style is almost the same as the Three Colours trilogy, as Jacob would be in the concluding part. Nevertheless, the one of the most enjoyable incomplete scenes is of the reverie by the tree, leaving it to the audiences mind to fill in the gaps.

Compelling, intricate and visually beautiful, you would get the sense of a mood and almost dreamlike structure to it, as if it had been filmed on the warmth of a lazy Summer afternoon. Krzysztof Kieslowski: rest in peace.

Verdict:

Kieslowski shows why modern day Dramas like Haggis's emotionally contrived 'Crash' tries to 'Hollywood' the real impact of love, grit and realism. 9/10.",1203724800,,1379,4.888412017167382
3244439,3,B000XXWE1M,"A comment on the DVDs, and a comment on the movie.

Both Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and the screenwriter comment on how few scenes Kieslowski picked from the vast amount he had shot, to make this short movie. Jacob even says she hardly recognized the film she had worked on when she saw it in the theater. The screenwriter says that five movies could have been made from the scenes shot. -- The movie is one hour 35 minutes long. That leaves four and a half hours for the two Criterion DVDs to show us some of these deleted scenes. Guess what? No deleted scenes. This annoyed me.

As to the film, the first image shows Veronika, the Polish girl, singing ecstatically as the rain falls on her face, while the rest of the chorus has taken refuge from the rain. -- The second image is of her making love passionately to her boyfriend. She is innocent, beautiful, full of promise, and doomed to die at a young age.

The two V&eacute;roniques cross paths when the French girl is on a tour bus and sees the Polish girl standing in a square where a political demonstration is taking place.

The Polish girl's segment lasts 28 minutes, and is wonderful. Each image seems to weigh on us, to pull us in by its meaning as well as its beauty. When Veronika dies of a heart attack in the middle of a concert, we share her view of the dirt being tossed onto her body under the ground. All these images are memorable.

The second part is a different story. The French V&eacute;ronique is a music teacher who becomes fascinated by a soulful puppeteer. He gives her mysterious signs that he loves her, and they make love in the penultimate scene of the movie.

This is a clich&eacute;, this has been done. One example is LILI with Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer, 1954. This story is stale, and the second two-thirds of the movie feel stale compared to the first 28 minutes. V&eacute;ronique's relationship with the puppeteer, as other reviewers have observed, leaves us unmoved.

As in his other films, Kieslowski inserts subtle parallels between the two stories. A strand of twine attaching pages of music is twisted by the Polish girl; later the French girl receives a shoelace in the mail. The little clear ball is seen in both episodes. A woman who looks at the Polish girl with strange hostility is matched by a woman in the French train station who looks at V&eacute;ronique in a similar way. The puppeteer's ballerina dies much as the Polish girl died.

The climax of the movie is when the puppeteer discovers a picture of the Polish girl in the French girl's purse. Seeing it, she is overcome with grief. He makes love to her, and her sobs of grief gradually turn into gasps of pleasure and finally orgasm. To me this scene is dramatically unseemly, a sort of cop-out. Something far better should have been here. But something far better than the puppeteer should have filled the last hour.

With enough scenes to make five movies, Kieslowski settled on this one-hour story of the girl and the puppeteer. I think he made a mistake, a fatal error in judgment. This kind of error can be seen in his other films as well. Failure to use the best scenes to the best effect, lapsing into banality when he should be at his best. Missing the opportunity to put in the scene that would have made the film a classic.

He once described himself as ""just so-so"" as a filmmaker. I think that is accurate. He has great moments, but too many weak moments.",1194652800,,3420,4.528363047001621
3244440,5,B000XXWE1M,"The late director Krzysztof Kieslowski had a magical style, and a subtle way of weaving exquisite stories with light and colour.

And one of his finest films is ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (""La Double vie de Vronique""). It's not just a philosophical, arty film, but a subtle and unique tale full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives Irne Jacob a chance to shine in her most challenging role.

There are two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique (both played by Irne Jacob). They have never met, never spoken, and do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer.

What is more, each has the strange feeling that she is, somehow, not alone in the world. One night, Weronika dies onstage while singing. Suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling, and stops taking her lessons. Weronika has died, but she still lives. Soon she begins to explore, searching for the truth about her double life, and a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.

""Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that manages to combine beauty and depth, with a great lead actress and brilliant director. And there's a luminous, quiet quality to the film that not many movies are able to convey, from the beginning to end.

And it's wrapped with just enough ambiguity to leave you wondering what it's all about. Is it about twin souls, love, sacrifice, fate, politics, being puppets in the grand scehem of things, or just about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? Even the ending is ambiguous; Kieslowski allows you to wonder whether happiness or grief is in the cards.

One thing you can be sure of -- Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art. He dots the film with plenty of little hints about the inner states of the characters -- the stars and leaves show that one woman is a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.

At times this film seems like a love letter on film to Irne Jacob. Not only is she followed constantly by the camera, but her character is difficult but rewarding. Jacob shines without really seeming to, with the emotion and wonder of a small child in an adult body. Philippe Volter's aura of mystery adds to his excellent acting in his too-brief scenes. But few of the other characters are given much dimension -- the whole focus is on Weronika and Veronique.

This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around your screen, and leaves you feeling a little sad. Interpret it as you will, but be sure that Kieslowski's ""Double Life of Veronique"" is exquisite.",1194307200,,3015,4.829457364341085

He has constantly been raising the bar from one masterpiece to another. I bought this DVD after adding the ""TROIS COLEURS"" trilogy, and ""THE DECALOGUE"" to my film collection. The DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE from the Criterion Collection made my collection a lot richer.

The unusual story headlined by Irene Jacobs,one my favorite actors and filmed in a unique style using predominantly yellow hues created an impact I never felt with any other film. Jacobs clearly established herself among the most talented of actors playing the double roles of ""Veronique"".

The other gems in the DVD - films made by Kiezlowski in his early days as a student film-maker, interviews with technicians who worked with him from those days, and people that inspired him as a film-maker, added a lot my own knowledge of Krystof Kiezlowski as one of the great masters of the art of film-making.

I can't add anything to that.  What I can say is that it was this type of commentary that induced us to purchase and watch the film and, while it was interesting, at the end I felt that the alleged messages of the film could have been conveyed more effectively and efficiently and I could have spent my time better reading a book.

My husband is a Polish scientist and we live in France, so we have a certain perspective that embraces both worlds.  He wanted to watch this one out of a sense of national solidarity, but his solidarity began to crack about 20 minutes into the film. Like me, he could think of many other things he would rather be doing than watching a Polish director ""make love"" vicariously to a French actress with a camera.

3244449,3,B000XXWE1M,"""Double life"" is a supremely well photographed and designed film, with a georgeous actress, not quite of this world, who sticks in the attention of the camera like a blood clot in the narrows of an artery. The rave reviews certainly indicate that the film speaks to many, especially folks who feel there is something magical and wonderous out there that we glimpse in our dreams and play with in our imaginations, something that repays our attentions with tingles of intuition from time to time.

For those of us who are empiricists, however, the film may be less appealing. To us hard-nosers, the characters are phantoms, ideals, and destractions that teach little about what life on earth is truly about. We remember the tingles that coincidentally approximate future events and forget the vast majority of them that prove false. This is human nature, and to the extent that this is a part of our psyches, ""Double Life"" may prove absorbing.

What I'm trying to say, somewhat gently, is this film isn't for everyone. Some, like myself, will admire the stunning photography and color of the DVD version, ogle Ms. Jacob, enjoy the beautiful but truncated music, laugh at the fantasy of the plot, cringe at yet another exercise of a director in love with his leading lady, grant that some may batten on fairy dust, but in the end ask, ""Where's the beef?""",1168992000,,1352,4.798283261802575
3244450,5,B000XXWE1M,"There are two women at the center of The Double Life of Veronique and they are both played by Irene Jacob. Veronique is a French music teacher, Weronika is a Polish singer. They have the same hair cut, wear similar clothes, use lip balm, and even share a heart condition. There are other similarities about their lives, but what's more notable are their differences. Weronika first becomes aware of her French counterpart in Krakow Square, where she watches her snap photos of a political demonstration before the doppelganger is whisked away by a tourist bus. One might be inclined to think they are the same woman, but they are not, as much as we are defined not by who we are but what we do.

Some are better at doing than others. We first meet Weronika as she is ""doing,"" so to speak: she sings with a chorus of others when rain begins to fall. While others run for cover, she holds her note, turning her face up to the sky. Soaked, she meets a man afterwards in a covered alleyway. They make love. Despite her lack of formal music training (or perhaps because of), Weronika is later discovered by a prestigious music company. She is, as they say, going places, except she isn't - her story is cut short in a manner I will keep to myself. Weronika remains, for the most part (like the film), a beautiful mystery.

While Weronika (the artist) is a person who does or simply is, Veronique (the teacher, the critic) analyzes, deconstructs, and covets. It's not by accident that we first saw her taking those photographs, indeed taking one of Weronika, the woman she would want to be if she knew her (Veronique teaches her students the songs that Weronika sings). The next time we meet her is also as she makes love, an act interrupted when Veronique strangely begins to cry. ""Are you sad?"" her lover asks. ""I don't know why. It's as if I were grieving."" She does grieve, in the way that people grieve for themselves and the lives they do not live.

While at a marionette show (one that tells a story of death and rebirth much paralleling her own). Veronique becomes infatuated with the charismatic puppeteer, so much so that she misses much of the performance. The puppeteer engages her (like our director, Kryzysztof Kieslowski, engages us) in a mystery of sorts, sending Veronique mundane household items through the post, items that hold significance in the popular children's books he has written. She turns them over in her hands, staring at them with rapt fascination, marveling perhaps at how the artist can give meaning to something as banal as a piece of shoelace or an empty cigar box. Perhaps it's envy of the artist, the god-like giver of life. Or maybe Veronique is simply happy to have some element of mystical and irrational romance in her life.

The Double Life of Veronique has been called a ""metaphysical mystery,"" not incorrectly, though what mystery there is does not have resolution. Like many of Kieslowski's great films, Veronique is about questions not answers, journeys not destinations. Doing not deconstructing. We are constantly asked, begged, to discard our laziness and see the world from varying perspectives - upside down, through smoke and colored glass, even from behind spectacles or a magnifying lens (I'd be remiss if I did not mention how gorgeously photographed this film is by cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, who also shot Black Hawk Down). There are other worlds besides the one we think we see, ones that might have been and still could be, and in these worlds we can be the people whom we hoped we would.

Interesting footnote: Kieslowski was a juror at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, where Steven Soderbergh's sex, lies and videotape took the Palme d'Or. He originally imagined that film's actress Andie McDowell as the lead in Veronique but later changed his mind.",1168992000,,3811,4.7681818181818185

Don't let the lack of standard Hollywood plot structure throw you, this is, in fact, one of the film's best assets.

That said, film remains a universal language, and this is also the most eloquent, mysterious and refined picture of human beauty you will ever come across.

Director Krzystof Kieslowski is best known for his renowned ""Thee Colors"" film trilogy: 'Blue', 'White' and 'Red'.  This film preceded those and is even more powerful if less well known.  It tells the story of two women living in different countries whose lives are mysteriously intertwined.  The story unfolds slowly, suffused with shatteringly haunting music and bathed in a golden, vaguely sepia-tinted haze.  You have never seen or heard anything like it before.  And if you are vulnerable to it's considerable magic you will never be able to forget it.

Heading into 2007 this kind of cinema seems almost lost to a world seemingly being swallowed up daily in crass, bombastic, essentially pornographic imagery; garbage that litters our televisions and movie screens without respite.  If you've seen too much of it, even acquiring something of a taste for it, this film may not be for you.  It may well be lost to you and if so you are immeasurably the poorer for it.

3244462,5,B000XXWE1M,"When The Double Life of Veronique was screened at the Cannes Film Festival it not only brought international acclaim and attention to its director Krzysztof Kieslowski but also to the film's star, Irene Jacob. At the time, the 24-year-old Swiss actress was virtually unknown but she would go on to even greater acclaim when she teamed up with Kieslowski again on Red, the final film in his Three Colours trilogy.

Criterion has gone all out with this edition managing to improve the already impressive MK2 region 2 release. There is a 64-page booklet that features an excellent collection of essays pertaining to the movie.

The first disc features an audio commentary by Kieslowski biographer Annette Insdorf. She points out that Kieslowski got his start making documentaries and that The Double Life of Veronique saw him moving into a ""deeply poetic brand of cinematic storytelling."" Insdorf, who contributed commentaries for Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, delivers a thoughtful track with excellent insight and analysis that is very accessible.

Also included are three short documentaries that Kieslowski made - Factory (1970), Hospital (1976) and Railway (1980) along with The Musicians (1958) made by Kazimierz Karabasz, a great influence on the Polish director. These are interesting glimpses at Kieslowski's progression as a filmmaker.

There is also ""The U.S. Ending."" Miramax distributed the film in North America and its head, Harvey Weinstein, asked Kieslowski to make it less ambiguous. Included is this additional footage that provides a neater resolution.

The second disc starts off with ""Kieslowski - Dialogue,"" a 1991 documentary on the making of The Double Life of Veronique. There is lots of fantastic on-the-set footage of the man at work directing his actors. This documentary provides fascinating insight into the film and the filmmaker.

""1966-1988: Kieslowski, Polish Filmmaker"" is a 2005 documentary that takes a look at his work in Poland. It traces his development as a filmmaker through the 1960s to the 1980s making short films, documentaries and feature films.

""Slawomir Idziak"" is an interview with the film's cinematographer. Idziak mentions that many of Kieslowski's collaborators weren't thrilled with Jacob's screen tests but when his daughter and her friends loved what they saw, the director realized he was making a movie for young people and that he had found the right person for the role.

Also included is an interview with long-time Kieslowski composer Zbigniew Preisner. He praises the director for being the down-to-earth type and talks about the challenges of being a composer in Poland.

Finally, there is a wonderful interview with Irene Jacob. She talks about the first Kieslowski film she saw and the first time she met him. It was an audition for The Double Life of Veronique and he asked her to improvise. It lasted all afternoon and she was thrilled just to work with him for that day. Two weeks later, he interviewed her and she got the part. Jacob speaks eloquently about working on the film, her technique and her experience with Kieslowski.",1164844800,,3104,5.229376257545272
3244463,5,B000XXWE1M,"This, Krzysztof Kieslowski's greatest film, is the sort of story that approaches a part of the mind few people ever utilize. Set in both Krakow, Poland during the fall of Communism, and France during the same period, The Two Lives of Veronica concerns a pair of young women, played with total perfection by the beautiful Irne Jacob, who, though all intents and purposes it can be said never meet, were born on the same night, lost their mothers at the same age, were raised to young adulthood by their fathers, and who are all-but identical to one another in appearance. Weronika, the carefree Polish woman, is a gifted singer. Vronique, Weronika's moody French ""doppelganger"" teaches music at a public school. Where Weronika is outgoing and happy, Vronique is deeper, quieter, more pensive.

We begin the first third of the film with the story mostly centered around Weronika's life in Poland, where she has recently moved from a small town into Krakow, away from her father. She is fond of an aunt there, a woman who reads Tarot cards for her niece and foretells that which she says is to come in her future. ""All the women in our family die suddenly,"" she tells Weronika,. ""Your mother died suddenly, I will die suddenly, and so shall you."" Weronika is too young and joyous to think of such a thing and only wishes to know about love. She has a boyfriend, a black leather jacketed rebel whose anti-Communist and pro-western views are symbolized by his reverence for the motorcycle we see him riding in most of the scenes. Weronika makes love to the young man while standing in a doorway in the rain, something she, raised in a pastoral region, would never have had the courage to do before her move to the city, and she feels at that instant that all is perfection. Beautiful, heedless, aglow with the way her life is unfolding, Weronika is envied for the sheer joy she feels. She also possesses a lovely voice, and while untrained, her raw talent is soon recognized by the directors of a local symphony. Given the chance to premiere a musical work re-discovered after several centuries in obscurity, Weronika is thrilled. She steps onto the stage on opening night, and begins her performance.

Meanwhile, at that precise instant in France, Vronique feels herself suddenly emotionally overcome. It is as if in one moment of immense feeling she has suddenly lost possession of her own being. Confused, she goes thru her life during the weeks that follow merely undertaking the motions of normality. She teaches school, she takes her students to see a wondrously artistic puppet show, and she sleeps with several men.  Still feeling herself lost, cut off from who she'd always thought herself to be, she even agrees to help a friend by making a ruinously cruel accusation against a man she does not even know. Puzzled by her own conduct, Vronique is finally led to the pinnacle of harsh understanding by a strange, remotely threatening figure of a man who comes to be in her life, almost against her wishes. The revelation of the reason for her state---which we already knew---comes as little relief to Vronique, and while she comprehends that she has spent her entire life as part of a unique miracle of bi-location, there is little consolation to it all.

The things one sees and feels in this film, from masterful location shots, to sudden shocks of plot development, to the scene with the beautiful puppet show, all these are so distinctly, unhurriedly European that I'm convinced no American could have made this film in exactly this way. The score Zbigniew Preisner composed for this wonderful film is unforgettable, as well. Above all else the vibrant performance Irne Jacob grants in playing two greatly different women is the best of her career. This touching motion picture strikes deep into the human spirit.",1159833600,,3820,4.8274809160305345
3244464,5,B000XXWE1M,"Perhaps there is a double life in each of us. The life we lead and the life we might have led.

In this superbly crafted film director Krzysztof Kieslowski poses a series of questions about why we became who we are. It seems that ultimately we are creatures subject to the vagaries of fate, destiny and random chance.

Irene Jacob is simply superb in the dual-role lead.

And Kieslowski is at his probing, questioning best as he maps out a journey that compels us until the very end.

3244465,5,B000XXWE1M,"A woman is griped by a sudden sense of sadness. She is grieving but she is not sure why or for what. The feeling that something has gone missing in the world haunts her.

Such is the start of the movie ""The Double Life of Veronique"".

An odd chance encounter with a children's book author and a puppeteer helps Veronique to get insights into her condition and feelings. The puppeteer thinks he is making up yet another one of his stories, but unbeknown to him he is helping Veronique unlock the secrets of her existence.

I found the movie ""Double Life"" the most dream like and the most mystical of all Kieslowski's movies that I had seen. In fact it isn't a movie, I would call it visual poetry. Since the plot and story are only a pretext to engage you on a subconscious level. The movie is starring actress Irene Jacobe and in the movie she is beautiful, child like in her innocence and passion for life. Yet a grown woman in her physical appearance. In the movie we get to see her in various states of dress and undress. As I watched the movie I had the feeling as if Kieslowski was in love with Irene Jacobe and he made the movie so that he could make love to her with his camera. The movie is erotic to the extreme, yet lovely and innocent in a way I can't explain.

I am not going to tell you the ending, but the only thing I will say is that only Kieslowski could make a movie that has a tragically sad and immensely happy ending all at once.

There were a couple of elements I didn't understand in the movie. I am sure they are in there for a reason, but I simply haven't been able to place them. The whole subplot where Veronique agrees to testify in court that she slept with her friend's ex ... what was that about? The other thing I didn't understand was the symbolism of Veronique rubbing a ring against her eye lashes.

I feel like I need to go see the movie again to fully understand it.",1158278400,,1903,4.214285714285714

This is almost certainly a PAL (not NTSC as shown) format disc, which most North American DVD/TV combinations would not play (the R4 region coding would be a problem as well).

UPDATE!

I agree with Brian Miller (Columbus, Ohio).  Amazon pulls this stunt every once in a while.  The same thing happened with ""Six Pack"" with an advertized release date of Sept 2005, then Jan 2010 and finally and ironically April 4, 2006.  I'm not sure how these things get by but with the volume of items available on Amazon, sometimes mistakes do happen.  This is a very irritating situation but in perspective, this is nothing compared to say the missing laugh tracks on T.A.G.S. Season #4.  At least this could be a sign that TDLOV is hopefully on the way.

Another UPDATE!

Okay, after perusing Amazon.com/UK and Germany, it appears that a two disc, Region 2 edition will be released on April 24, 2006.  DVD Extras will include; Conversation with Kieslowski; Interview with Irene Jacob; 'Kieslowski, Polish Filmmaker' documentary; Short Films: 'The Musicians' (1958), 'Factory' (1970), 'Hospital' (1976), 'Railway Station' (1980).  Sounds really nice!

After Veronique become a music teacher, she meets the mysterious puppeteer, who is the key person to find out the truth. When they gather the clues, they realize the shocking truth!
 Director Kieslowski is good at describing two things at the same time. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful classical music. These techniques contribute to give something abstract and philosophical impression. Irene Jacob played both Weronika and Veronique and won the best actress of the Cannes film festival in 1991.

3244492,5,B000XXWE1M,"One of Krzysztof Kieslowski's finest films is ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (""La Double vie de Vronique""). It's not just a philosophical, arty film, but a subtle and unique tale full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives Irne Jacob a chance to shine in her most challenging role.
There are two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Veronique (both played by Irne Jacob). They have never met, never spoken, and do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer.
What is more, each has the strange feeling that she is, somehow, not alone in the world. One night, Weronika dies onstage while singing. Suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling, and stops taking her lessons. Weronika has died, but she still lives. Soon she begins to explore, searching for the truth about her double life, and a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.
""Double Life of Veronique"" is one of those rare films that just begs to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? About fate? Sacrifice? Love? One woman's soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols and metaphors can be unwound any which way, and in the end they all work. Even the ending is ambiguous -- is it happy, or sad?
Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction is impeccable. His use of light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" practically a work of art. He dots ""Double Life"" with plenty of little hints about the inner states of the characters. The stars and leaves, for example, hint at the personalities of Weronika and Veronique -- one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.
At times this film seems like a love letter on film to Irne Jacob. Not only is she followed constantly by the camera, but her character is difficult but rewarding. Jacob shines without really seeming to, with the emotion and wonder of a small child in an adult body. Philippe Volter's aura of mystery adds to his excellent acting in his too-brief scenes. Unfortunately, few of the other characters are given much dimension -- the whole focus is on Weronika and Veronique.
This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpret it as you will. Kieslowski's ""Double Life of Veronique"" is exquisite.",1077926400,,2684,4.91409691629956

3244496,5,B000XXWE1M,"I imagine this film is subtly autobiographical because the director is Polish and yet his films are all made in French. So the two Veroniques could quite possibly be the twin creative personas or muses of Kieslowski himself. The one Veronique is Polish and dies singing, the other lives on in France but with a sense of having missed the one important connection in her life. So the film feels like an allegory of lives or destinies unfulfilled and the most obvious destiny that was cut short was Poland's but this film does not make speeches, it whispers.
As an artist living and creating in exile Kieslowski must himself have felt divided into two parts. Modern life feeling impersonal is a classic theme of the twentieth century yet the way Kieslowski tells it it does not feel at all cliched, rather he breathes new life and new understanding into what it means to live in the modern world. His allegory presents a very high vision of humanity which makes us all feel responsible and connected to each other in some way. But the appeal of the film is that it says everything in such an intimate way. Veronique is a film which becomes richer with each viewing. Kieslowski's films tap into a very new kind of place that has no language barriers. His films return to a purity that is almost silent. A universality is present in his art that is quite breathtaking.",1034985600,,1364,4.617283950617284

To say this is 'one of the most beautiful movies and Kieslowski is a genius' is stating the obvious. It is a dream and ... who else to dream about, other than the beautiful Irene Jacob!
Irene herself is a dream in this movie as she portrays two gifted look-alike musicians, sharing the names Veronique (in France) and Weronika (in Poland). They share the same ill-health, destiny and sadness. And they share an unknown effect on each other's life, despite being worlds apart. The inexplicable depression that Veronique feels when Weronika dies while performing on a stage, makes you ponder 'whether in my life I too wasn't depressed for some or other inexplicable reasons?' 'Is there another I somewhere concerned about me?' 'Is that why I was sad during that time?' 'Is someone else sharing my sorrows being somewhere in this world?' 'Will I meet him/her sometime? Somewhere?' Yes, unanswerable questions, inexplicable feelings and surrealistic thoughts. That sums up this movie.
There is an excellent sub-plot too, a puppet and its master. It is very symbolic and highly metaphorical. I still don't think I understood it properly. The music is haunting. Like the violin in ""Un Couer en Hiver"", Veronique's vocal music stikes chord with you. It is enchanting and sad at the same time. Close your eyes and you are drowned in dreams!
Irene Jacob is dreamy and natural, aimless, sympathetic, gorgeous, child-like innocent and sexy at the same time. She definitely deserves all the awards for her stunning double role.
'La double vie de Veronique' comes out with flying colours when compared with Kieslowski's much acclaimed colour trilogy (White, Blue and Red). Watch this movie seriously, you will enjoy it. Thank you Kieslowski!",1003708800,,1755,5.076124567474048

3244501,5,B000XXWE1M,"""The Double Life of Veronique"" [1991: Krzysztof Kieslowski, Director; starring Irene Jacob, Best Actress Award, Cannes Film Festival 1991] is a metaphorically rich and haunting drama. This beautifully filmed story parallels two musically gifted young women [both played by Irene Jacob] with the same first name [Weronika [Polish] / Veronique [French]], mirror images of each other, born on the exact same date in different countries [Poland/France], suffering from like physical frailties, with similar possessions/character traits, who are total strangers whose paths cross briefly only once. Yet each senses the presence of an ""unknown other"", an overwhelming impression of ""not being alone in the world"". The subtle affect that these women have on each others' lives - unknowingly and at a distance -- is hauntingly reinforced by the ""dreamlike"" cinematic attributes of the film. The premise of ""The Double Life of Veronique"" is that there are undeniable, irrepressible, conscious and subconscious connections and intersecting forces in life that impact us all - transcending and defying distance, time, culture and conventional reason.
There are concentric subplots that emanate from this central story involving various lovers [one is an accomplished, but manipulative puppeteer who creates 2 more ""Veroniques"" in the form of marionettes], significant emotional events that turn the course of lives and causing individual stories to dissolve/meld into others, strong parental bonds and familial grounding, the power of music/art as a life catalyst.
The gold light that permeates this film, occasional blurred imagery of memory flashbacks and the sequences with the ""mariposas de luz"" [flickering butterflies of light from mirror reflections] truly conjure a dream-state aura that at times borders on the supernatural. The various symbolic threads in the film [death/renaissance, kaleidoscopic perspectives on life, the two young women as political emblems of the European community, the poetic symbolism of a ballerina puppet who transforms into a butterfly, etc.] rock the collective unconscious of the viewer - allowing the imagination to wander. The musical backdrop for the film serves as a leitmotif that links both the Polish and French sequences with an indomitable spirit and awe. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" pre-dates Kieslowski's Red, White and Blue Trilogy [1994] - and could easily be re-titled ""Gold"" in the director's creative alchemical spectrum of films.
In interviews, Kieslowski revealed that he created different endings for the film for different cultural audiences - further reinforcing the ""multiple"" dimensions of his concept. I found the film to be sensorially and thematically stunning - and the acting superb. If you don't mind reading subtitles, or already understand Polish and/or French, appreciate this type of out-of-the mainstream, esoteric genre, and don't have the compulsive need to have every question explicitly resolved - I highly recommend this film.",1000944000,,2997,5.662222222222222

This film was directed by Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski just before he made his Bleu, Blanc, Rouge trilogy.

Also notable is the gorgeous soundtrack by frequent Kieslowski collaborator Zbigniew Preisner.",992131200,,733,5.116666666666666
3244504,4,B000XXWE1M,"Much of this is an adoration of French actress Irne Jacob byDirector Krzysztof Kieslowski; in a sense it is a homage to her, oneof the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented.  If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin.  She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her.  Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected.  She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.

The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red).  The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka.  But the main point is Irne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves.  We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe.  And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.

Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd.  Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there.  Vronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her...  She loves her father and old people.  She is a teacher of children.  She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true.  And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point: she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.

An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties: there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998).  It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.

Note that as Weronika/Vronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life.  It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star.  This film is his way of making love to her.

Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs: Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994).  We could use another like him.  END

3244505,5,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life of Veronique is an absolutely stunning film.  The director, whose work includes Decalogue and the superb Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, and Red), displays a confident tone in his deliberate pacing  and the subtle way in which he establishes the mood of this picture.  In  Irene Jacob (also the star of Red), he finds the perfect leading lady, who  has an innocent yet mysterious and beautiful aura which works so well with  the tone of this film.
There isn't really a plotline in this movie, but  in general, it concerns the lives of two women  (Veronique and Veronikka,  both played by Irene Jacob) born on the same day but in different  countries.  Though they lead separate lives, there are parallels drawn in  their existence, and their paths cross ever so briefly as the story of one  woman dissolves into the story of the second.  There is a distinct  dreamlike quality to this film, and certainly, mood rather than narrative  is the dominant driving force to the film.
Most Americans will consider  this film to be a typical European ""art house"" film.

If we accept (and I found this hard to do) the fascination as a manifestation of the sixth sense she discusses with her father, why does she flee from him in the station cafe? Further, having fled from him, why does she allow him soon after into her (refuge hotel) bed, both for sleep and for sex?  I don't recall this troubling me when I first saw the film, but it overhung the entire final part of the film for me on this DVD viewing.",1517529600,,1134,4.5268292682926825

8230158,5,B000XXWE1M,"The Double Life of Veronique (1991) is in the traditional Kieslowski mold of symbolism, mystery, irony, and artful imagery. This film could pass for a thinly-veiled sci-fi labeling. What I love about this film is its willingness to be something strange and surreal, while maintaining its elegance and believability overall. With artful classical numbers, coupled with an unusual color tint to the settings, the film is slow, subtle, yet powerful. Some of the musical numbers are extremely powerful in their presence and and impact.  In some ways, the film is haunting in its tone. Irene Jacob is perfect in her role, as she exhibits emotion extremely well, and the audience is with her. While watching this film, one gets the sense that they're trying to solve a riddle by asking what certain things mean, whether they're objects, images, or even the strangely-tinted colors throughout. Overall, this is an enjoyable film that's a table setter for Kieslowski's next work, the brilliant Three Colors trilogy (Blue, White, & Red). This blu ray is an excellent transfer from The Criterion Collection, with a clear picture and crisp sound. The special features are good, and I also enjoyed the 40-page color booklet included with the blu ray. Overall, an awesome Criterion release!",1497139200,,1277,5.139423076923077
8230159,5,B000XXWE1M,"Kieslowski has directed several excellent films before this one, but The Double Life of Veronique is a work of genius. It is tight, spare and visually brilliant. Irene Jacob's performance is extraordinary. It is sure, confident and nuanced. Whether the context is Poland or France, in language and mannerisms she makes her persona credible. Thematically, the concept of alter ego is explored with subtlety, and the cinematography is simply stunning. Two thumbs up.",1494201600,,464,5.36986301369863
