5059108,5,B00772GK58,I teach martial arts for a living and it is amazing to see what Todd is able to accomplish with his body.  This movie is both heart wrenching and inspiring.  To see someone able to lift themselves up from the pit of despair to being a champion is something that can make all of us realize there is nothing we can't overcome when we make the right decisions and set our mind to it. I highly recommend this movie for those who are going through or who know someone who is going through addiction.  It is my opinion that this movie should be shown to every high school and college across the country.,1360713600,2,597,4.265486725663717
5059109,5,B00772GK58,"I loved this movie.
This is a must watch for anyone with an addiction, or who likes to do athletics for a cause /or is thinking about it. It will motivate you to get off the couch. I too race for a cause, I do events in USMC combat boots to raise money and awareness for combat PTSD and in support of my military son. I got a lot of inspiration from this movie and found a little of myself in it. When you have a burning desire to help others by putting yourself though physical suffering, not everyone will understand it or you. It's a balancing act between doing what your heart & soul tells you -- you must do -- and keeping your family from feeling abandoned due to your training schedule. My heart really went out to him.....

Bravo to the film makers.",1356307200,,757,4.184931506849315
5059110,4,B00772GK58,Rnning with Demons is an inspiring real life story. I watched it prior to a half iron man and could relate to the demands that distance racing put on a person. I didn't know what an ultra iron man entailed and cannot imagine what it takes to get the support one needs during training and racing. I wish that would have been discussed even though I have no intention of trying it.,1352073600,,379,4.277777777777778
5059111,2,B00772GK58,"Yes I understand how addiction can take hold of someones life and how difficult it can be to overcome, but at the same time, this guy goes from one addiction that partially ruined his life and jumped right to the next which he's allowing/allowed to ruin his marriage. He complains about how he's allowing it to happen and how he doesn't want to lose his family, yet he keeps travelling all over the world competing in events. Seems VERY selfish!!!",1350864000,,447,4.6
5059112,5,B00772GK58,"Addiction plays by its own rules. Left unchecked it will destroy all those in its path. When watched this film may open the eyes of someone struggling to understand why things are going so badly in their life. Addiction is hard for  the addict to see, even harder to overcome. Never give up!",1344988800,5,291,4.490566037735849
5059113,5,B00772GK58,"Excellent story telling. Excellent film. Sorry I couldn't stay and see it at Sunscreen Film Festival. Glad I took the time to download it.

5059114,5,B00772GK58,"I own his book, his 1st movie ""Addict,"" and this movie.  I am very familiar with his story and organization.  This is by far the best of his material.  I work as a counselor and teacher and have utilized this movie in both capacities.  The way he documents his struggles with hope for himself and others is powerful.  If you are looking for a good story of how a positive addiction changed someone's life, this is it.  Personally, I enjoyed the scenery in this movie as he ran his ultraIronman.  The combination of story telling amongst his race was a style that kept me interested for the whole movie.  I was worried because the interview style used in his first movie ""Addict"" did not keep my attention and has not gotten rave reviews from the people I have shown it to.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in recovery from addiction and/or triathalons.",1336521600,,864,4.558441558441558
5059115,5,B00772GK58,"This documentary primarily consists of interviews with the main character. There are a few, short interviews with other people in his life. The focus of the narrative is on how sport can help one overcome addiction, but also on how sport can create other relationship issues if someone lets their life be unbalanced.  The coverage of the Ultraman event exists, but you don't get any sense of the other competitors; you do get a sense of the coaching team for the main character.

Good. Meditative. Not flashy. Well worth watching if you're interested in the themes.",1329609600,2,565,4.875
8511470,3,B00772GK58,"The extreme level of dedication and commitment shown in this book is almost insane, and that's the point.  This film inspired me, and caused me to consider what lengths I might go.  The film shows that we can definitely accomplish more than we may think.",1400112000,,254,4.622222222222222
8511471,3,B00772GK58,It's a good watch and has helped me with my depression. Planning my next event and anything that helps is great,1399161600,,111,4.333333333333333
8511472,2,B00772GK58,story is a very slow mover. Do not look for the obvious to show up quickly and its very subtle...almost need to know what you are looking for to find it.,1391558400,,153,3.967741935483871
8511473,5,B00772GK58,I am a therapist and a runner and I loved this movie. Todd knows his stuff; running and therapy. I will recommend this to my clients and believe he is on to something. Inspiring story about how anyone with willpower can get clean and can push their body to do amazing things.,1388016000,,275,4.3076923076923075
8511474,5,B00772GK58,Great story of a man at a crossroads in his life coupled with a huge mental and physical task starring him in the face.  I loved it.,1381190400,,132,3.888888888888889

Todd shares this journey with the viewers and look back at his battle over addiction and the near destruction of his family as he replaced one addiction with another ""healthier"" addiction.  He shares the mental and physical struggles of completing this event.  The cinematography is good and you can feel his pain every step of the way.  If you like documentaries and sports then you would probably find this interesting.",1379116800,,676,6.561797752808989
8511476,1,B00772GK58,"Not the best made documentary. The Road Uphill and Bradley Wiggins: A Year in Yellow are to fairly recent cycling documentaries that are both excellent. I was hoping that this would be equally as well made just with different subject matter, but this is not even close. I didn't like the rock music either. Still hoping to find more well made documentaries. This isn't one.",1376179200,,373,4.753846153846154
8511477,5,B00772GK58,I admire Todd for his endurance and passion for the sport. Hopefully he can work things out with his family for the best. Watching this made me want to go out and Swim Bike Run! Very inspirational.,1370044800,,197,4.351351351351352
8511478,5,B00772GK58,"This documentry was by far one of the best recovery related story's that I have ever watched. It goes to show how dedication, hope, and hard work pays off to over come an addiction. It shows how if you put your mind to something that you can do anything that you set your mind to. I am definatly going to pass this documentry on to other struggling people I know. I have been sober for just a short year but that is one year that I have behind me from my alcohol abuse. I have been working the program and Racing for recovery is by far the best support group around. Not to say that AA is a bad program but it's just not for all people. Anyways keep up the good work Todd, you are an awesome guy, with the biggest heart, and I am glad to say that I have you as a friend / mentor! See ya on Thursday brother!",1363305600,,807,3.957055214723926

Along the way, he has found a way to help others gain control of their lives and enjoy the happiness they deserve.
