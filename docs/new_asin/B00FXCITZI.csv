6035832,5,B00FXCITZI,"I tried a partial session On Demand and it was such a great workout that I am buying the DVD. I had a 21 minute session and was sweating buckets but was able to keep up through the entire thing (I do work out a lot so this wasn't too bad, but it tested my cardio!). The instructor took a minute of getting adjusted to, but now I think she's great! She's a little kooky and emphasizes having fun over and over. My arms were pulsating afterward, I got to play with new punching styles, and it was really cool! when things get faster-paced it is a little harder to keep up, but if you just keep moving and trying the general movements then I think you will just get better every time.

My favorite part about it is that you can do the workout BAREFOOT! I hate putting sneakers on! My feet feel a little sore now, so I might try with sneakers next time just to see how I feel about it.

THE SOUNDTRACK IS FANTASTIC! Old school breakbeats and remixes that are bumping all the way through!! I almost wanted to stop and dance a few times ;)

Overall I think this is a really great workout to throw into the mix, incorporating cardio, strength, and balance, and it was fun!",1292025600,94,1165,4.191964285714286
6035833,5,B00FXCITZI,"This is by far the BEST workout I have ever tried!!!! I have been doing PILOXING for almost 2 years and the results are phenomenal! It's fun, its sexy, it's empowering, and it will whip you in to shape! I've tried Tae Bo, Zumba, everything -- PILOXING is my workout of choice!! I highly recommend this to everyone!",1291248000,11,314,4.431034482758621
6035834,5,B00FXCITZI,"I absolutely LOVE this Piloxing DVD! I of course had tried many work outs, go to the boring gym, try to work out on my own but nothing pushes me like Viveca's Piloxing DVD. I have a new found love to working out and pushing myself. It's so much fun and the first time I've really truly felt TONED. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!",1290556800,6,318,4.063492063492063
6035835,5,B00FXCITZI,Piloxing is the best cardio workout I have ever done. It burns more calories then any other workout I have tried and it pushes my endurance to the limit. It also strengthens my muscles and gives me the drive to want to eat right. I give this DVD 5 stars!,1290470400,5,254,4.1
6035836,5,B00FXCITZI,"If you love Piloxing you should absolutely buy this DVD. If you don't know what Piloxing is- google it, and then buy this DVD!",1477612800,,126,4.291666666666667

6035838,5,B00FXCITZI,"Love this workout. I used to take a Piloxing class the instructor went back to school so the class was cancelled. Glad I was able to get DVD, the arm section is the best, it will leave you sore!",1477008000,,194,4.0
6035839,5,B00FXCITZI,Great workout video!  Even the bonus workouts are killers!  Love it!,1475452800,,68,5.090909090909091

6035843,1,B00FXCITZI,No timer and the main menu is hard to understand. The quality is horrible and the description was totally wrong. You can find better workouts for free on youtube.,1473552000,,162,4.620689655172414

6035848,2,B00FXCITZI,I bought this after taking piloxing at my gym for several years hoping to be able to do it more often. I was super disappointed in the lack of rhythm with the moves and the overall structure.  I'm glad it was cheap because I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this. (Ok really I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money),1471219200,,311,4.098360655737705
6035849,5,B00FXCITZI,I love this workout.  Its hard for me to find workouts that I can do due to my chronic back pain.  If the moves become too much I just modify them and still get an effective workout.  Highly recommend.,1470614400,,201,4.102564102564102
6035850,5,B00FXCITZI,Appears to be the same thing as I get in the class and this keeps me busy and between the two class sessions I have a week love the exercises just like what we doing in our exercise class,1468972800,,187,3.8205128205128207
6035851,5,B00FXCITZI,I love this video! The moves are a combination of easy and difficult. I notice a difference in my legs after doing piloxing because I have more strength to move. I also lost inches in my waist too! This video is a must buy.,1468800000,,223,4.090909090909091
6035852,5,B00FXCITZI,Really fun,1467590400,,10,4.5
6035853,1,B00FXCITZI,I bought this with the gloves. It arrived 9 days later and didn't work due to a different area code. What is the point of selling to different countries if it's going to work?!!!!! Very disappointing and annoying! I'm having to put a star in to post this but obviously it's no stars I can't even play the thing!,1467158400,,311,4.288135593220339
6035854,4,B00FXCITZI,It's kinda boring,1467072000,,17,5.0
6035855,5,B00FXCITZI,I alternate with this dvd and my Zumba class. I love the fact that this makes me sweat and burn calories.  I just need to invest in some gloves but I still get the same intense workout from this dvd.,1466467200,,199,3.975
6035856,1,B00FXCITZI,"There's a reason this DVD is only $5 and some change.  It was simply awful in every way.  The production value and sound quality was very poor and amateurish.  The instructor is intolerably annoying.  Her strong accent and random grunting make me want to commit suicide within five minutes.  I returned this promptly and, thankfully, received a full refund.",1466467200,2,357,4.983050847457627
6035857,3,B00FXCITZI,"Piloxing the DVD is sort of based on Pilates-- but it's more like a bit of barre work meets boxing. There is a fair amount of cueing but she's not helping you keep form all the time. A lot of it is motivational - ""keep it up girls"" talk when she should be talking form in every section. I know pilates well (been doing it for over 10 years), and some points are correct but she doesn't keep up with modifications or pointers on form. Her boxing technique isn't really authentic. It's  a little sloppy. Do not count on this to defend yourself ever! It's not a boxing class-- it's a workout.  You will sweat. You will burn calories...... but it's not a totally complete workout.  ( I have spent over 10 years doing and reviewing workout  videos..... including martial arts, boxing,  step, aerobic dance, and lots more.)",1465948800,4,817,4.493243243243243
6035858,5,B00FXCITZI,Fun and fit!,1465430400,,12,3.3333333333333335
6035859,2,B00FXCITZI,"The different sections are not easily labelled to skip to the three 20 minute express workouts.  Also, she uses terms from kickboxing but shows the moves incorrectly so to someone who has a background in martial arts or has taking real kickboxing classes before this could be confusing/annoying.
I gave it two stars because the dvd does mix kick boxing with Pilates/ballet sections which is unique.",1464998400,,398,5.03030303030303

6035867,5,B00FXCITZI,"I have really enjoyed this DVD---my arms burn for sure when doing the exercises (with the weighted gloves)---which are explained carefully and easy to follow.  What I am especially impressed
about is the Bonus Workout that comes at the end of the DVD--3 parts--one for arms--one for abs and one for legs/butt---great workout.  I alternate this dvd with doing Piyo and Insanity.  Very happy!  Cant beat the price!",1459123200,,412,5.014705882352941
6035868,5,B00FXCITZI,"This is a great workout for sure. I love pilates and usually just do my cardio on the treadmill which I HATE. This combines pilates and cardio in one workout and it gets pretty intense. I did it a few times without the weighted gloves but I just did it with the gloves for the first time and it really takes it to another level. I recommend this if you want something fun and effective. You WILL be sore the next day, I can promise you that.",1458777600,,441,4.080459770114943

6035880,5,B00FXCITZI,fun workout that gets you moving. It is motivating and fun to do. I really don't enjoy or like working out but this video makes it go by fast. I am sore the next day which is a good feeling.,1455408000,,190,3.775

6035883,5,B00FXCITZI,"I'd never heard of Viveca Jensen and knew nothing of her workouts. I figured - hey, it's $5 bucks, not much to lose.  Me and my husband were blown away.  This is an 'intermediate' level workout - but those just starting out can benefit as well.  You can stop and take a break as needed - then get back into it.  As an example - we also do Biggest Loser, Denise Austin (Yoga, Pilates, 7-Minute Solutions) and Billy Blanks Tae-Bo (mid-level workouts).  The cardio is about 40 minutes - and there are three sculpting workouts that are about 20 mins each (includes warm up/cool down).  The 40 minutes combines kickboxing and Pilates - all standing.  I love how she starts each group slow, then speeds it up.  She keeps it fun without being 'cheesy'.  The three sculpting workouts focus on arms, legs/butt (ouch!) and abs.  I was amazed at how much I hurt from a workout with no weights!  Also - this does not include a lot of 'planks' (for those with foot issues).  The only downside is you can't choose which one you want to do - so you have to fast-forward if you only want to do one - or the last two.  Small issue for a $5 workout.  I plan to look for other Vivaca workouts.",1453766400,5,1174,4.301369863013699

6035886,5,B00FXCITZI,Piloxing is a fast pace workout.  I take it as a class at a local gym from a piloxing instructor and this DVD still kicks my butt.  There are modifications that you can make to the exercise which is great.  Jensen is up beat and funny and keeps you engaged.  Great price to give it a try!,1453161600,2,288,4.0
6035887,5,B00FXCITZI,"This video is awesome! She makes it really fun and sexy! You take it at your own pace, and can even take breaks and then easily join back in without getting confused.",1452384000,,166,4.21875
6035888,5,B00FXCITZI,I usually don't write reviews however this DVD deserves a very good review.  I am a home DVD junkie and for the last 12 years have intermittently gone to the gym when I've had time . being a physician that usually does not occur often therefore I am very dependent on these DVDs.  I recently had a C-section and during my pregnancy I did a cardinal sin which was I stopped exercising altogether so I'm basically trying to get back into shape by using low impact exercises. first of all she explains in  her DVD that she is Swedish therefore if anyone has any issues with an accent then this Dvd is not for you. She has very good instruction and is very motivational. I have done this DVD a few times and have never been able to complete it 100%. Because it is challenging Doesn't look challenging in the beginning  only because it's doable.-and I love DVDs that are doable and you don't have to think so hard regarding the choreography. But at the end of it you are sweating !!! it is a combination of tae bo and Pilates. I actually pictured Billy blanks in her place several times. When I did go to the gym I used to take kickboxing from Les Mills and I can honestly say that this is equally if not better than that. What I appreciate even more is that she has girls in the back and they are different sizes and different shapes and each one of them are working out properly.  I especially appreciated the girl in the back with the long blonde hair because usually when people make DVDs they have hard to beat figures that we have to live up to but this was A down-to-earth slightly heavier  girl and she was rocking it and smiling the whole time !  What I don't get is why this DVD is just five dollars-  it even has a bonus track for one hour. That price does injustice to the quality of exercise that's in this DVD,1450915200,8,1818,4.249275362318841
6035889,5,B00FXCITZI,"This is a great workout. Fun but challenging. I also really like the bonus workouts for strength and endurance. If you like kickboxing, you will like this.",1450742400,,155,4.777777777777778
6035890,2,B00FXCITZI,I do not love this workout.  I find it jumps around too quickly & I do not feel that moves are explained in full.  I also find the background people goofy to look at.  One girl looks miserable & one of them seems completely full of herself.  They are distracting from the workout.  There is a very good ab workout in the final 10 minutes.,1450137600,,338,4.138461538461539
6035891,5,B00FXCITZI,Love this workout. I recommend a pair weighted gloves to go with the video (I didn't have them at first). This video works my everything.. I really feel like I've had a good workout after doing this video. It my new favorite.,1449792000,,225,4.380952380952381

Its a great workout, but I am in tip top shape because I also do insanity, but this still makes me sweat. Great way to change things up.",1439510400,,443,3.879120879120879

Pros: Quiet background music, good cueing, varied and interesting workout.",1439164800,,339,4.728813559322034

It incorporates some balance exercises to mix it up, and the people on the video really are having fun.  The sound isn't that great on the video but what do you expect for 5 bucks?

I have very poor balance so this was a great workout for me. I just wish there was more of a timeline included for the entire main video or the option to choose segments. I probably would have continued if I knew how long it was or what sections were in what order. I have tried the express toning yet. I bought a different brand of weighted gloves 1lb each. I highly recommend using gloves of some form of weight because I can already feel it in my arms and shoulders. Also I went bare foot and had no issues with the light jumping or foot shuffling involved. I think it actually made it better.

6035949,5,B00FXCITZI,"I was pleasant surprised by this video! I heard about Viveca Jensen on Mission Makeover and thought her workout looked like fun. I remembered seeing the video at Target, but didn't want to get it without checking out some Amazon reviews. Well, the reviews were positive and the video was just under $5 with free shipping, so I decided to give it a try. The video arrived earlier than expected and I was pretty excited to try it. Wow, what a workout! This workout works EVERYTHING! I have done many workouts including Power 90, P90X, Brazil Butt Lift, Yoga Booty Ballet and regular yoga. All of them are great, but I never have finished a workout and could not wait until I can do it again like with this Piloxing workout.
Some of the moves can be a little confusing at first if you're not used to them, but you can pick them up rather quickly. Also, if you have knee problems, this might not be the workout for you. I could really feel it in my knees, but I also know my knees need more strengthening - if a move required jumping, I just didn't and still was getting a great workout. Viveca encourages you to do what is good for you...and then go a little more. Great advice - know your body; but don't be afraid to push yourself. One con of this video is that the workout is an hour. That might turn some people off, but it really does go by quickly. I figure I can give an hour twice a week for my health (my strength training workouts are only 30 min.). It's $5!!",1425945600,,1466,4.258064516129032

6035958,3,B00FXCITZI,"Well, my opinion is all over the place when it comes to this DVD.  I'll try to hit the highlights (and lowlights) and, even if you don't agree with my opinion everywhere, at least I'll hopefully be able to give you a feel for whether or not you'll like this.

There are two workouts on this DVD.  One is the actual ""Piloxing"" and one is labeled as a ""bonus"" toning workout.  Both are actually about an hour long.  Although the bonus workout is divided into roughly 20-minute segments, you can't select individual segments from the DVD menu.  So you would have to fast forward to get to the segment you wanted (it goes arms, lower body, core) or else just do the whole thing.

I'm not a huge fan of the main workout.  I think it's a great concept and I definitely like some things about it, but it didn't challenge me very much.  It's a combination of Pilates and boxing moves, but also incorporates a lot of movements/exercises I've seen in dance-based workouts.  I do like the idea that being strong and being feminine are not mutually exclusive, and I think that is expressed in the Piloxing part of things quite nicely.  The ""boxing"" moves here make up the bulk of the cardio portion of the workout and are pretty standard for boxing/kickboxing-type workouts (i.e., various punches with footwork).  Cardio segments alternate with toning segments.  You do not need any weights for the toning segments; they are completed with bodyweight resistance only.  So one bonus to this DVD is that you really don't need any equipment.  (The ladies in the DVD are wearing gloves with very light weights in them.  You could get something like that if you wanted, and it would probably make the upper body portions of the workout much more challenging/effective.  I didn't have gloves like this, though.)

There's a fair amount of jumping around so it puzzles me that some of the participants (including the instructor) don't wear shoes.  I would definitely recommend shoes for any of the jumping segments.  I can also see the benefit of having no shoes for the dance-inspired and Pilates-inspired segments.  However, there is not much of a stopping point between segments (one just flows into the next) so you'd have to pause the DVD frequently to take shoes off and/or put them on.  I chose to wear shoes because jumping without shoes causes me knee trouble.

You will likely find the instructor either fun or annoying.  She does talk a lot (like almost constantly).  You can hear her clearly over the music (which is kind of generic workout music).  The set is a pseudo-boxing gym sort of place with lots of pink.  The camera work is mostly fine except that I think there are too many demonstrators behind the instructor.  You can't see the ones in the corners half the time.  Perhaps a wider camera angle or fewer participants would have been better.  It just seems crowded in the space where they're working out.

I can deal with most of that.  The main reason I'm not so enthusiastic about the Piloxing part of the DVD is that it just didn't get my heart rate up.  I didn't break much of a sweat until after the 40-minute mark.  (On the other hand, this could be a useful introduction to boxing-based workouts and some light toning for beginners.)  I felt that this was quite easy.  And the cardio parts were just too similar to lots of other workouts I've done in the past.  If you're new to boxing workouts, you will not get the best instruction on form here, but at least the moves will be new to you.  I am probably not going to continue using this workout because I don't think it will burn enough calories for me, personally.

On the other hand, the ""bonus"" workout was great.  I liked it a lot more than the main workout.  It's all Pilates-based toning.  It's done in a more traditional fitness studio setting with only the instructor and two demonstrators.  It's much less busy and much less crowded.  The instructor still talks a lot but I actually DID feel the burn in my muscles in this one.  This one challenged me; it's different from working out with weights, though.  (There's no boxing in the bonus workout.)  You essentially work through different areas of the body and do bodyweight-based resistance moves.  The upper-body parts were not as difficult as the lower-body and core parts.

One thing I liked about some of the lower-body parts was the tripod stance.  This was much more comfortable (and sustainable) than the traditional hands-and-knees stance you do in a lot of workouts.  It allowed me to focus on form and movement in my lower body instead of worrying about how my wrists were aching (they weren't, here).  In general, the progression of moves in the ""bonus"" workout seemed more logical and better-designed than the main workout.

In the end, the idea of this workout was great.  The execution, not as much.  There were some definite good points, but I don't think this is going to have lasting value for me.",1422403200,33,4936,4.657010428736964

However, the hour is tolerable and I even find myself smiling during the workout.  As a beginner, I am able to handle it based on Viveca's modifications and encouragement.  Plus, who doesn't love a charming Swedish trainer!  She definitely keeps you motivated throughout, and changes up the routine so you don't get bored within that hour.  I am moderately sore after the workout ( a good thing I think!), and will be able to increase the intensity as I get stronger.  As a beginner, I am not using the weighted gloves, but will start soon.  For the price of the DVD it is definitely worth giving it a try.  To be honest, I probably would not have ordered this DVD based on the picture, which looks a little too ""much"" for my style, but a friend recommended it to me, so I thought I would give it a try.

6035997,5,B00FXCITZI,"I rarely review things on Amazon, but I was so impressed with this DVD!  It is a very upbeat and fast paced workout, but she breaks it down and builds up to more complex moves so anybody can do it.  The other part that I really really liked was how she focuses on technique and posture throughout the workout.  I'm decently experienced in kickboxing and it really annoys me when I see people just throwing punches in classes because it doesn't work the right muscles and it will lead to injury really fast.  She not only has a technique/instructional section on the DVD, but throughout the workout she is constantly reminding you about correct posture and form.  The other thing that I loved about this DVD is that the women in the class are all different body types.  Viveca preaches about empowering all women and you can see it in her workout.  She is positive, fun and motivating without being super cheesy and annoying.  I hope she continues to come out with new workout DVDs because I'm sure I will be doing this one a lot!!!",1405468800,,1031,4.505376344086022

Viveca is fun and not too annoying at all. My back kind of hurt after this workout due to the boxing aspect, but a little extra stretching helps with the kinks. The extra bonus toning workout (15 min each, arms, legs & butt and abs) is really great. It is hard at first, but it will get easier and goes by fast. I do all three at a time.

This is a fun and fast paced cardio workout, the hour goes by quickly with the variety and pace provided. I was curious to try this as it's intended to be a barefoot workout and I love it.  Pilates influences most moves, the kickboxing moves tend to be mostly upper body, and in my opinion there is a feminine Tae Boe-type feel to a few of the moves too. Definitely adding this to my workout DVD rotation!",1397001600,,509,4.247422680412371

6036017,4,B00FXCITZI,"I purchased this DVD off the fact that I remembered it from Exercise tv on Demand and liked it. It was only a short 20 minute version and the DVD is longer I think about 45 minutes. I enjoy the workout and the instructor does it in bare feet, I don't though the only issue I have it seems like some parts she is winging it.

I'm all for having fun working out but I'm more of a basic let's get it done type, I would never do Zumba or one of those Dancing with Stars workouts. So sometimes her bubbly attitude can sort of irk you a d a few times the cueing seems off.

You will sweat and work your thighs, buns and abs + cardio but the instructor can be a bit much, when you normally workout with Jillan, Jari Love and Bob Harper. It's not my fav but I do it once a week at least.",1396051200,,779,3.8625

6036020,3,B00FXCITZI,"I was excited about this DVD after reading some of the other reviews, but... I don't know... it seemed a bit unstructured and a little boring to me. I shouldn't be too upset since the price is so good (you get what you pay for, right?) but I found myself distracted by other things around the house instead of focusing my attention on the workout. First of all, I was a little annoyed that I didn't see where it said on the DVD case/menu screen how long the workout was so I wasn't exactly sure how long I was going to be doing it. The case said something like 2 hours and I KNOW that wasn't for the main workout only. I like to have a mental countdown of how much time is left during workouts, like most people! I also felt a little claustrophobic for some reason because Viveca's assistants seemed way too close together on the screen. I think it was the angle at which they were filmed, but they felt crammed into my TV screen. I wasn't overly impressed with any of the choreography; most of it I had done before in other workouts, but some moves she put a ""sassy"" edge on to make more feminine and fun. I did the workout for about 40 minutes before turning it off so I don't know what else I've missed or how much was left of the workout - I guess I will attempt it another day - but the only part of my body that was sore the next day were my triceps from all of those pushback exercises. She has a positive attitude and tries to keep you motivated, I just don't think it was fast-paced or structured enough for my particular taste.",1395360000,3,1537,4.178451178451178

The workout itself flew by and was so much fun! she moves between cardio type moves (mainly low impact) and pilates inspired exercises. The end result is calorie burn and toning in one neat package.
Viveca and her team are engaging and she inspires without being abrasive or condescending.

6036029,4,B00FXCITZI,"I don't absolutely love this workout, but that's just personal preference (it's fun but not as fun as others, imo). It works the inner thigh a lot, which is what I was looking for since my doctor told me my inner thigh isn't as strong as my outer (resulting in knee issues). I also like the combination of pilates and cardio/boxing. Definitely something to put in rotation.

There are 3 20-minute workouts for abs, arms and lower body in the bonus section which I was looking forward to doing on a light day, but they are all sculpting and no cardio. I would prefer a quick cardio in the beginning before getting to sculpting. They also are grouped together without a menu section. If you want to do the 20-minute ab section, you have to fast forward through the other two, which defeats the purpose of a ""quick"" workout.

Overall, the hour-long workout is great if you have the time. It goes quickly and doesn't get boring.",1393459200,2,924,4.526946107784431

Viveca appears to have a very cursory understanding of a few boxing and Pilates moves; the women working out alongside her are able to execute the moves with greater style and fluidity than Ms. Piloxing herself.

Piloxing seems a one-trick-pony with a bit of flash and little substance. Viveca seems like a marketing front for someone's bankroll.",1392163200,3,445,4.766233766233766

The bonus workouts-  3-  20 minute videos -  these were killer workouts-  she really worked each body part  (except for chest) to the max-  I am pretty fit and work out daily but these workouts really burned.

Her bubbly energy and enthusiasm makes you want to work harder -- but she always cautions you to work at your own level and do what you can.

The hour-long workout was a sweat-inducing combination of boxing and moves that were sort of like standing Pilates moves. Some were also very similar to ballet movements, such as plis and tendus. I definitely felt it in my legs, and in my arms too -- in the video they wear Piloxing gloves that weigh 1 pound each, I think, but I didn't have them so I used light wrist weights. I also loved that this is a workout you can do in your bare feet -- Viveca and some of her back-up crew don't wear any shoes. However, for some of the jumping moves, such as the jump-and-switch boxing stance, shoes might be a good idea after all.

The Express workout was a series of moves targeting arms, butt/thighs, and abs. These were more Pilates-oriented and were all excellent toners, especially the butt and abs sections.

I would recommend this video to anyone who loves fun fast-paced cardio, wants to do some toning without heavy weights, and likes Pilates in addition to some dancey steps. Is it pure boxing or Pilates? No. But it uses some of the moves from each in a light-hearted workout that will get your heart pumping and your muscles working.",1390953600,,1629,4.59106529209622

6036058,5,B00FXCITZI,"I purchased this DVD because I'm always looking for new workouts, and for the low price, I figured I wouldn't be out much if I didn't like it.  It arrived yesterday, and I tried it today for the 1st time.  I LOVED it!!!!  It is a great blend of cardio work and sculpting exercises.  Viveca Jenson is very encouraging and enthusiastic throughout, and reminds everyone to work at their own pace and build up to doing more each time they do it.  I am a religious exerciser, and this was just challenging enough for me to say, ""Wow!  Can I do one more set?""  I will definitely be incorporating Piloxing into my regular workout routine.",1390867200,30,631,4.434782608695652
6036059,5,B00FXCITZI,"I'm the type of person who gets bored very easily during workouts. Cardio on the treadmill and the elliptical don't really cut it for me. I bought the Piloxing system after googling what burns the most calories in an hour (yes, I googled that. don't judge ;)) and Piloxing came up. I watched a youtube video and loved Viveca's personality as well as the workout so I bought the system with the 1/2 lb gloves. It's a combination of kickboxing, pilates, and dance. It seriously is the most fun workout ever. I've tried Insanity and I feel like Insanity is moreso for athletes or people who are really in shape just to be able to get through the workout. I would take so many needed breaks during the 45 mins of Insanity that I would only end up burning about 200 calories a workout (I have the Polar watch that counts cals burned) and would think what the hell, I'm dripping sweat, i'm on the floor about to die.. I should have burned more than 200 cals. With Piloxing though, you don't have to be in complete shape for the cardio workout and that's not to say that Piloxing is not intense because it is. I still sweat and it keeps my heart rate between 130-160 the whole workout. But she works you up and cools you down every few minutes which is the best way to burn cals and I can get through the whole workout without constant breaks, sometimes without any breaks at all. She makes you want to keep going. For the whole 50 minutes or so, I burn approx 450-500 cals. I'm 5'5"" and about 135lbs so someone who weighs more, would burn more calories than that. I'm so in love! It has fun dance music in the background and I love how she's always changing things up. I would definitely recommend this workout to anyone. I only started this workout 5 days ago and I'm seeing some results already :)",1390435200,3,1793,4.3552238805970145
6036060,5,B00FXCITZI,"I literally just finished doing this workout. I'm sweaty and fairly certain I will be feeling it tomorrow! I have to say, this is one really fun workout. I, like another reviewer stated, stumbled upon this and for the price I thought ""what the heck."" I was smiling through the whole thing! The time flew by and I really enjoyed myself. I will definitely use this frequently for the fun factor alone. But I should say you will get a great workout with this as well. Being that it is so fun I was not really thinking about the work part of it! Again, I'll likely be feeling this tomorrow! Highly recommend.

Update: I really did feel this in my arms, back and core the next day. Especially my upper back muscles from all the punching. Legs feel it too! I got home from work the next day and just wanted to do this workout again. So, I did! It is that much fun and a great workout too! This is the first time that I have looked so forward to a workout. I don't have the gloves I just use 1lb dumbbells. First time through I started with 2lb dumbbells but quickly made the switch to 1! It's tough but something to work up to. I just can't express how much I love this thing! I have to be careful not to over use this one so I will always have it to look forward to!

Update: Wow! I'm back to talk about this once again. I did the Express workout and thought it was so good! I was surprised that it is another hour+ workout sequence. What a bargain this has turned out to be. The Express is target toning segments that are really quite good and challenging. I'm considering weighted gloves for these workouts because gripping a dumbbell is pretty taxing on my forearms. Again, I can not recommend this enough! If you are considering this, just get it. I would have paid more for this after having done the whole thing! Heavy in my rotation, this one!",1390089600,98,1845,4.253561253561253

For the price (under five dollars) this dvd is an excellent value. The workout itself is pretty long, but once you've done the entire thing you can start/stop it for the portions you like. And there is an ""express option"" which I think is the ""bonus"" workout"" on the menu. I really like that there aren't any long infomercials or product promotions to wade through.

6036076,4,B00FXCITZI,"This is a good middle tier work out- not too challenging, not too easy. It has a mix of cardio, strength and pilates, which is a good combo to keep your muscles guessing. It's about an hour long, and by the end the weighted boxing gloves, which you are recommended to use, will leave your arms really tired and sore. The rest of your body will not feel as worked, though, so if you're after a comprehensive full-body work out maybe look elsewhere, like to Jillian Michaels' Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.
Viveca is refreshingly vivacious and makes you smile as you're working out, primarily because her commentary is like listening to the lyrics of the Danish pop band Aqua, mixed with Shakira's greatest hits.",1379116800,,709,4.725806451612903

Yes, Viveca Jensen's voice gets annoying and she really doesn't have proper form for a hook or jab, but it gets the job done.  I work out about 4-5 times a week, running, strength training, kickboxing, and yoga.  I wanted a home video to work out to and I heard about piloxing in fitness magazines.  At the end of the workout I was sweating, although I think I was more into the kickboxing moves and from my experience used proper form.

I usually get about to the 30 minute mark before my legs are too tired to continue but I will keep at it. Viveca is a great motivator as well and her accent is pretty adorable.

If you're a boxer,like me,don't expect a boxing workout. There are a few punches incorporated but otherwise all Pilates. Great for beginners and intermediate for a change of pace.",1360800000,,530,4.353535353535354
6036096,4,B00FXCITZI,"I like this workout more than I thought I would. Getting past the name was half the battle. Say it with her Swedish accent and it sounds less ridiculous for some reason.

This is a fair cardio workout for and advanced beginner to intermediate. If you can do The Firm or Tae Bo you will breeze through this. I have low back problems and this is reasonably low impact for the cardio and does not get it aggravated (Traci Anderson's BS cardio, on the other hand, nearly landed me in the hospital).

I get just a little sweaty and I am never sore the next day, which is nice and means I can do this one more frequently than the more advanced stuff I also like.

I do wish the floor work and ab sections were better. The floor work is hard to follow without watching exactly what she is doing, which is hard to do when you are on all 4s. The ab section is just a little too light for my tastes. I personally don't like the pilates style scoop ab exercises she starts with. I may just have my form off, but they do nothing for me.

I do like this DVD for my light workout days. I like the instructor. She is not irritating and is pretty easy to follow. It is not overly dancey and is a very nice change of pace from the other DVDs in my library.",1360454400,,1239,4.065573770491803

Her incredible on-screen energy makes this a really fun yet sweaty and effective workout that burns a lot of calories but will also give your muscles a good workout without heavy weights.  I don't have the gloves she is wearing, but I make do with wrist weights that are one-pound each. There are a lot of fusion workouts on the market, but this one stands out for its uniqueness.  The blending of the boxing and Pilates is seamless and I like getting the benefits of both. There is no wasted downtime; she keeps things moving at a good pace. I would rate this as good for the high intermediate exerciser.  I hope Viveca puts out more workouts like this one.",1360281600,,823,4.496644295302014

I thought this would be a great way to get in some cardio while still doing some strength exercises. I love Pilates. I love boxing. I thought it would be a great combination. It is a good combination.

However, I feel like this DVD lacks instruction. If you do not have a foundation in either boxing or Pilates, you will probably be doing this entire DVD with improper form. The instructor doesn't spend much time on form (any at all, really). I'm not a big fan because of that. I think the DVD is fun because it's a combination of what I like to do. It does get me sweaty but it really depends on how much energy you exert. If you aren't trying, you aren't going to be getting a good workout.

In the beginning, during the warm-up, she bounces in her stretches. I don't like that. I don't think that is necessary. I wish she had some solid punching going on. There's also too many girls behind her. Some of them get completely cut off during some shots. There's also random ""woot"" and ""whoop"" in the video. I say it's random because these screams do not come at the climax of any of the moves. Quite frankly, I would rather have louder music than have those screams. If you want to hear genuine enthusiasm, check out Insanity.

The entire workout is an hour long. To be honest, I think it could be shorter if she did more solid punching with more cardio/boxing moves. It would be more effective and more challenging.

I think Piloxing would be more fun in a real fitness class at a gym. The DVD is a nice introduction to the workout. I think it's good but it's not perfect. There are tons of things that can be improved. But I am having fun doing it. Hopefully, it'll motivate me to keep going.",1349654400,,1790,4.3026706231454

I have no problem getting through it but there are times when my heart rate does spike but Viveca immediately slows it down and I am able to catch my breath. I am always shocked at how sore I am the next few days after as there are no additional items used other than your body weight (there is an option of 1 pound gloves but I have yet to purchase those). It makes it a perfect travel DVD plus many of the people in the DVD do this without shoes so you don't even have to pack those!  I am always amazed at how quickly an hour can go by during this workout.  I find Viveca to be fun and not annoying at all. I like how she continually reminds you of your form and reminds you to think about using your core during the course of the workout.  Some of her moves are silly but this is suppose to be fun so as long as you aren't taking it too seriously, you should enjoy it.

6036104,5,B00FXCITZI,"This DVD is great!  I have attended piloxing classes at Viveca's studio in LA and with other instructors on the east coast.  However, I travel A LOT and sometimes cannot make it to a class.  This DVD is a great alternative for a full workout and really works best for me when I do it from start to finish.

Please note: the workout is best with the gloves and you will need access to a mat.  I have had no problem locating a mat at any hotel which has a fitness club.  You will not need gym shoes, so I can save room in my suitcase but do prefer to wear grippy socks.  Many people do this workout barefoot as well though.

A gym membership didn't work for me and neither did numerous exercise DVD's.  This piloxing video is simple, fun and gets the job done. I am now going to add the gloves to improve arm tone.  PS.

6036107,5,B00FXCITZI,"I just got this at Target. They do include the actual piloxing workout in the 4 DVD package now, and not just the express toning. It is a great workout, especially for people who find lifting weights and just running on a treadmill to be boring. It really works your arms, thighs and abs (I have been doing it for two weeks and still can't do the floor workouts all the way). Amazon sells alb weighted gloves too and they really help out with toning.",1332720000,,450,4.305882352941176

This is not for the faint of heart and will pose quite a challenge for those who are not used to exercise! Absolutely, by all means get this if you are new to exercise though as you can go at your own pace, stop when you need to and build up slowly. This was so much fun!! I sweated so much, found myself smiling through the agony! She is a lot of fun!! I highly recommend this workout for anyone who wants to lose weight, get in shape, or just get those feel good endorphins going!! I can't wait to do this again!!! :)",1332201600,,617,4.024390243902439
6036109,5,B00FXCITZI,"Excellent. Viveca is delightful, warm, instructive and a power-house. Her physical condition is an inspiration. The DVD is made well enough. She introduces herself in one part, she explains the moves in another, and then the routine. You can choose to do one section or do it all. I wish she would put out another just so I could mix it up. Piloxing is for me and I have bad knees. One negative, the background sound is unpleasant to me.",1331856000,,437,4.475
6036110,5,B00FXCITZI,"When I say I hate working out, I mean it. I hate it with a passion. I find ANY excuse not to do it. Even a simple 20 minute power walk. But as the months drew closer to my wedding, I decided to tone up. Just to clarify, I have an average body. Not fat, not skinny, just there.

I live by the Toluca Lake area where the Piloxing classes are offered (and Viveca Jensen is an instructor there). A friend of mine is a Piloxing addict and goes to the studio frequently. She told me to try it and just have fun with it. Since I'm not a workoutaholic, I decided to save myself the embarassment of going to the studio where everyone can see my ridiculous moves (and also to save everyone injuries due to my lack of coordination), and searched for the DVD online.

Amazon is usually the first place I go when I buy...well...pretty much anything. Purchased it from here (for the regular shipping method, it came really fast), popped it in my xbox and proceeded to sweat, curse, drink a crapload of water, push through and curse some more for an hour.

And I felt amazing. I never understood that feeling people talk about after working out. That I-feel-so-pumped-and-energized-I-can-conquer-the-world feeling. I always felt drained, irritated and too tired to feel ""good"" after working out. But this does it for me. Viveca is a ball of energy. She can be corny sometimes (and so can some of the moves) but it's not to be taken seriously which is what I like about it. Btw, it's not professional boxing or anything so don't go criticizing her form and technique. Plus, it's the boxing part that helps with my anger ;)

Woke up the next morning and had a hard time moving out of bed. But the pain felt good and it was well worth it. I have been addicted ever since.",1330992000,59,1753,4.401234567901234
6036111,5,B00FXCITZI,"A little bit about me...I'm overweight, not out of shape, 32 years old and work out consistently and rather intensly. I make sure my heart rate is at least 127 (easy workout) and usually do intervals to jump that number up throughout my workouts. My workouts are at least 45 minutes long, 6 days a week and I average 145-155bpm most of the time I am working out. I love the elliptical, almost anything Bob Harper (Inside Out Method Cardio Rev being the fav), the Cardio Challenege video from Supreme 90 day and Leslie Sansone 4 or 5 miles for my easy days. I'm just noting this so you get an idea of what other workouts I enjoy and my level of fitness (and because you don't have to be thin to do this workout).

I heard about this workout on some tv show and then decided to watch a clip on Youtube. It seemed like an easy, fun, girlie workout from what I had viewed. I wasn't sure if it was for me, but after reading the raving reviews here on amazon I decided to give it a try. If anything, it'd be a nice easy day workout to add to my collection of workout videos. I was looking for something a bit feminine.
I was completely wrong about it being an easy workout. I use a heart rate monitor to make sure I am reaching the correct level and this video gets my heart rate to go from about 130-138 (when in a ""sleek"" part of the video) to about 160 (when in a ""power it up"" part of the video). The workout is very decieving too. It seems like the time just flies by. I usually do not do the mat portion (I think the last 10 minutes) of the DVD. This is just my personal preference because I am limited to an hour a day for a consistent workout. However, the 47 or so minutes that I do actually complete seem to take only 30 minutes. I mean, I just don't know where the time goes! I look forward to doing this DVD every other day. It keeps me energized, makes me feel sexy, makes me feel girlie and really works my muscles. I am not looking to build muscle, just tone. This workout does exactly that. By using one pound weighted gloves, the sculpting and boxing moves actually do tone. Something to keep in mind...when I first started doing this DVD I could not do all of the balance moves very well. ""Serve the Platter"" was nearly impossible for me. Now, I can complete nearly everything (I've only been doing this for 3 weeks about 3-4 times a week). I prefer to do this workout without shoes because I feel like doing it barefoot is helping me to increase my foot strength and flexibility. Just to note, I also smile alot during this workout. I thought Viveca Jensen was going to be too cheesy, but somehow she's not. She's actually rather entertaining. The music is good too. Yes, she does make some things up as she goes along the routine and does get a little ""funky""...but that's what makes this so fun to me! The thing I love about this video is that I do notice definite improvement in strength, but it's more of the type of strength gained from pilates. I don't even know how to explain the difference between this and my other workouts, other than it just makes me feel great. Putting actual effort and power behind the moves is the key to making this a great and rewarding workout....just like any other workout. Don't write it off just because it seems like the people actually in the video are having an easy time of it.",1329696000,10,3334,4.2586750788643535
6036112,4,B00FXCITZI,"I've done this workout twice and I really like it. I think she cues well and the exercises flow well one into the other. She does do some corny moves where you feel like you should be stripping, but that's just at the end. It's a great core workout. If you use the gloves, it makes a big difference. I would recommend getting the gloves because even though they're only 1 lb each, they still make a difference. You also work your butt a lot. She doesn't mention this, but you have to squeeze your butt cheeks together to help with balance doing these moves. maybe there is some other way, but i don't know it. I took ten years of ballet and as soon as you put me in first position, i automatically suck in my stomach and squeeze my butt. lol. The first time I did it, I inwardly groaned when i saw it was an hour workout, but it goes by pretty fast. The floor exercises at the end still kick my butt, but some day I'll get through them without stopping. Anyway, I would highly recommend this workout for those who want to have a little fun and feel a little sexy during your workout.",1328227200,,1083,4.186602870813397

Don't get me wrong it's not one of those so easy time flies type of work outs, IT KICKS YOUR BUTT! I feel so energized and awake right now, but I bet I will be feeling it later!

Exact same cover as on Amazon. Express Toning is broken into 3 sections (Arms, Buns&Things, and Abs) around 20 minutes each. I normally do Insanity so this was not the fun cardio I expected. I must say my muscles were very sore after. Probably in conjuction with the real Piloxing sold on Amazon, this would be a good all around workout. The other 3 dvds are boring. If you want a good toning one, buy the set at Target for $14.99 just so you can try the other 3 too.

After some looking around, I thought I'd give this one a try.. and I'm really glad I did. It was exactly what I was looking for. A nice cardio routine that was also a bit of a hard core workout. The reason I didn't give it five stars was that there were some segments that didn't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the work-out, and sometimes it was almost like she was winging it. But overall, it was a good solid workout that got my heart rate up. The instructor did a really good job of giving the workout a more serious feel.. in spite of the occasional dancing.. ;-).",1320192000,,680,4.007352941176471
6036117,2,B00FXCITZI,"First regarding the dvd itself.  It's very loooong I'm not one to stay focused on an exercise dvd that's more than 20-30 minutes, it gets boring and I have two small children at home so it's hard to spend that much time in front of the television following along with this.  The dvd at times had a lot of ""cheese factor"" to it that I could have done without.  Lastly I found this dvd at target sold in a package with 3 other exercise dvd's all for only $14.99!!! That's 4 dvd's for under $15.  I paid just under $26 for it by itself.  So I was pretty upset when I saw it at Target.  All in all I wouldn't recommend this dvd unless you don't have small children to take that much time away from without other supervision for them and if you like ridiculously long boring workouts.",1318291200,3,779,4.194630872483222
6036118,5,B00FXCITZI,"I waited a couple of months before posting this review in order to try the workout. Although I am not overweight, due to health issues I consider myself ""out of shape"" - LOL. I do NOT like running or high impact aerobics- or anything really that makes me feel like I have to pound my body/""work"" out.  I found this DVD to be really adaptable for my needs.  I have not worked up to completing the full workout - but some days I do the first 30 minutes - then cut to the cool down session. Sometimes I just do the first 10 - I have altered some of the moves (side step/did slower reps/decreased height from floor with knee bends, etc) and I still get an EXCELLENT workout without jarring my joints or stomach. The instructor is really entertaining - and helps you with doing adaptations. I like her she is quirky, empowering, and entertaining. This is my first boxing-type workout DVD and I really feel I got my money's worth from this purchase.  To get the full experience I DEFINITELY recommend buying the gloves (1lb) - You get more of a workout for your time. They can also be used with other tapes as well or with walking (which I also do a lot). I am already looking for more DVD's by this instructor.",1316390400,12,1205,4.323008849557522

I don't think she is annoying. I like her. She doesn't talk too much or too little.
The only part I have a problem with is the beggining of the floor part. I have to take so many breaks in the 8 minutes (I think it is about 8 minutes) and can't wait to get the the ab workout right after that. I think it is because I can't get the form right, so it's making it harder for me to do. I've tried everything and can't do it!",1316131200,2,688,3.852112676056338

I thought it was long. . .a little too long. . .and I didn't know if I was really workingout to the best of my ability because I was concentrating on the moves so much. After the first couple times of trying it I grew to love it. Watching the women on the dvd workout and having fun makes me enjoy it and I feel like I'm there with them. It's the workout I do when I'm not in the mood to actully workout. . .except I sweat like crazy so I know I'm working my butt off.

The best of feminine pilates and masculine boxing combined for a great workout without hurting my knees.  How can one sweat if one is not jumping or doing lunges?  Vivian does more repetition and combos in fluttering movements.  Not only will your muscles feel the burn, but your heartrate will go up.  Don't be fool by the small movements.  You will sweat as much as the instructor.  It's all in the gloves.  Swinging your arms in those 1 lbs gloves is enough to give you a sweat! By the time you get to the floor exercise, you will be exhausted. Great workout and the instuctor is smart enough to trademark this effective workout :)",1312848000,14,794,4.427586206896552

I love the Pilates/boxing mix as it breaks up the workout going back and forth between Pilates style moves and boxing cardio.  My only complaint is that the cardio segments really aren't all that challenging.  I welcomed the break from the muscle shaking pilates segments, but I found my heart rate wasn't as elevated as I had hoped it would be.

She goes a bit faster than I can go but I really enjoy the workout. It is geared for girls though and I don't think guys would appreciate the girly ballet segments.,1296691200,,343,3.8450704225352115
6036142,5,B00FXCITZI,"First of all....pay no attention to the 1 star review, as the reviewer has NOT EVEN TRIED THE WORKOUT.  This is a great workout/dvd!  It keeps you motivated, not bored, and not watching the clock the whole time hoping for the end to come soon.  Get up and press play.....you don't even need to put on your sneakers!  FUN AND IT WORKS!",1296432000,33,334,4.338709677419355
6036143,5,B00FXCITZI,"I really like this workout, I tired it ON Demand for the last few days. I've been looking for a workout to replace the Tae Bo basic workout, which I really love too. At first I do agree with one of the reviews her voice is annoying, but I don't even care anymore. I was sweating my booty off well before the 21 minutes ended. I really like that I will definitely be able to do the workout everyday and see progress from the previous days and weeks. Those kicks you do and balance on foot are really tough! I'm going to buy the tape before the free On Demand session ends as its only 23 minutes and its listed at 60 minutes on Amazon.com.",1295568000,27,637,4.104
6036144,1,B00FXCITZI,"I know everyone else said how awesome this workout is, and note that I have not tried it. I found it, thought the name was cute, but also got to thinking that isn't a very good combo. So since amazon didn't offer a video, I went to youtube and look it up, which I recommend to anyone thinking of buying this video. From the clips I watched I found this more as a joke than a serious workout. Yes, the instructor looks good, but her punches are flimsy and her voice is annoying. But I overlooked one flimsy punch and then I saw her and her team doing hook punch. Again, very flimsy. Your arm is supposed to be parallel to the floor and elbow was so far down it looked really sloppy and lazy to me. But then again, boxing is my thing.

I am not saying the workout wouldn't work. I mean it looks like it keeps you moving all right, but don't expect to actually get anything more out of it.",1292803200,14,886,4.091954022988506
8619204,5,B00FXCITZI,"I really love cardio bare and kickboxing and this is the perfect blend for me.
You will sweat your butt off, but the end result is worth it.
The video is fast paced, but the instructor is great at giving direction and keeping the workout fun and interesting.",1527984000,,258,4.395833333333333
8619205,3,B00FXCITZI,I was hopping I could use on a stand alone computer. But requires a net work set. up. Didn't work out,1524096000,,101,3.857142857142857
8619206,5,B00FXCITZI,Today I worked out with this tape and I will give it a 5 star .....,1523318400,,67,3.25
8619207,1,B00FXCITZI,Not my favorite at all.  I do Tae Bo and wanted another version of it but the trainer is annoying and I just couldn't get into it.  Donated it to Goodwill,1518998400,,154,3.935483870967742

8619209,5,B00FXCITZI,"I absolutely love this DVD. I was introduced to Piloxing by my Personal Trainer who knows everything about fitness. The PT became too expensive, and you don't need a PhD to be good in a gym, so I have my routines for weight lifting. My work schedule is inconsistent, so group fitness classes are not always available when I need one to break up my weight lifting routine. This DVD is excellent, and amazingly is a total body workout. Viveca Jenssen is the creator of this technique and teaches it in a way anyone can learn. This is a one hour 500 calorie workout, so give it a try!
Great seller!",1482105600,,595,4.36936936936937
8619210,3,B00FXCITZI,This exercise program is not suitable for someone who isn't already in good shap and able to pick up fairly complex boxing and piloty (sp?) moves quickly. The pre-training program certainly doesn't prepare you for the moves she makes. Camera angles often make it difficult to figure out what peoples' arms and legs are actually doing.,1482019200,,334,4.982142857142857
8619211,5,B00FXCITZI,I really enjoy this workout it looks easy but you really do feel the squats and reps she does the next day good for energy  boost,1481068800,,129,3.9615384615384617
