2452564,5,B000C3L29I,"The instructor goes at a very good pace, and the background music gives you a perfect rythm to follow.  I have the workout memorized, but still play the video to listen to the music, to pace myself properly.  I wish I could just download the music and use it alone now.  The video is also broken into 4 sections, which allows a beginner to ease their way into the full routine, or an expert to get a full workout in.  After a while, I felt it was necessaary to add more reps to my routine.  These seems to get easy over time.

I had great success with this video.  It is a great way to get started on an ab routine that actually produces results.  I had a fairly prominent six pack in a few months of using this video.  I also used another video in combination with this one, but this was the main video that I believe helped me achieve my results.  Obviously the video alone will not help, you must eat right as well.  Good luck!",1265587200,,930,4.139664804469274
2452565,4,B000C3L29I,Tom offers some new training for your abs and body core. I like the short workouts and the differant leavles of training. The only reason I don't rate it a 5 star is there is no warm up section. Tom just gets to work and for someone new they may not realize how important it is to warm up before doing the workout. This is some what like abs of steal for men but just not as good. If Io could find ans of steal on cd I would buy that one first.,1255219200,,444,3.78494623655914
2452566,4,B000C3L29I,"I thought this was quite good. There are 4 different workouts, each approx. 6 minutes in length, so they are good add-ons to other workouts. Definitely doable with all kinds of variations and he doesn't waste too much time talking and gets started quickly. Also a plus, the DVD doesn't play a lot of useless stuff up-front and gets right to the menu selection. My favorite is the 4th workout where he uses a dumbbell throughout. Feels really good.",1222992000,,447,4.670886075949367
2452567,4,B000C3L29I,"This is a good dvd for those who hate being encouraged, cajoled and lied to by the exercise presenter (i.e. ""I know you can do 7000 more obliques in the next 60 seconds!""). Holland is no nonsense, and each workout is about 12 minutes long. It's a great wakeup routine, and abs-olutely fabulous for cardio days.

My only caveat about this is women with generously sized ""girls"" may find some of the exercises a bit difficult, and anyone with wrist, elbow or shoulder damage will have to skip some routines.",1194307200,5,505,4.611111111111111
2452568,1,B000C3L29I,"Based on the reviews I decided to buy this, after buying about 4 others, This one is by far the worst. The entire program was warming up! It doesnt really teach anything new at all. Its just the basic ab workout, without any burn. If you want to get the same workout, you might as well do 25 crunches...",1192060800,,303,4.1525423728813555
2452569,4,B000C3L29I,"In Total Ab Workout, fitness instructor and physiologist Tom Holland has created four abs routines, each about six minutes in length.  Each routine is progressively more difficult, culiminating with the final routine, which adds a dumbbell to increase the challenge.  Tom filmed the workout in ""real time,"" meaning that there are no cuts or edits; it's just a smooth, one-on-one abs workout with Tom.  In additional to traditional crunches, the routines offer Pilates-like moves as well as back stabilization work to balance out the core.

The DVD Main Menu offers the option to play the entire workout or go to the Routines Menu, which breaks down each of the four routines into 6-7 segments (you need to actuallly click on the first segment to select the routine).  The exercises listed on the Routines Menu are as follows:

Routine 1:  arm slide crunches/alternate bent knee pulls/crossed leg obliques/plank/four-point bridge/bicycle

Routine 2:  bent knee pulls/bent knee oblique lifts/bridge with lift and hold/crunches with legs up/crossed leg raised foot obliques/plank with raised leg

Routine 3:  straight leg lowers/corkscrews/bridges with leg pulses/double crunches/the rope climb/two-point bridge

Routine 4:  double roll ups/double oblique twists/bridge with leg holds/double butterflies/double press ups/plank

I liked the fourth routine the best, partly because it felt the most Pilates-like and partly because I liked how Tom worked in the use of the dumbbell; on the other hand, the third workout actually felt more challenging to me.  Tom does not show modifications for any of the moves, and thus I think these workouts are best suited for experienced beginner to intermediate exercisers.  Overall, a very nice series of ab routines that would be great for add-on work.",1191801600,12,1788,5.423913043478261
2452570,3,B000C3L29I,I thought it was a good basic workout.  There was nothing special or unusual in it.  It was not a video that wowed me but it was okay.  I didn't find it to be difficult but fine for a beginner basic workout.,1181174400,,207,3.880952380952381
2452571,5,B000C3L29I,"This is definitely the best Ab workout. Working in a desk job,I kept gaining weight around the Ab area.

After just two days of this DVD, I had results. It was incredible. The fat around my abs just kept shrinking and

shrinking.

I would recomend this to anybody. No matter how fit you are,

there are four levels of difficulty. Practically anybody can

do the first level. I do all four. Already I am seeing results.

I hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well.

Cannot stress how fast the results are. You will probably see results within a week.",1151280000,18,569,4.413461538461538

8095510,3,B000C3L29I,Just boring and not that challenging for advanced users,1409961600,,55,5.222222222222222
8095511,4,B000C3L29I,"Tom is a very good teacher.
I like the way he explains things and my guy friend feels more macho taking a class with a guy teaching it.",1396051200,,135,3.857142857142857
8095512,5,B000C3L29I,"I love it. It's simple but effective ab workout DVD. It takes only 30 min. No fancy equipment needed. As long as I continue doing it, it would work out.",1372896000,,152,4.1
8095513,5,B000C3L29I,"This is my second time purchasing this DVD. The first one grew legs and ran away from home. I like the simple, no-nonsense approach he takes. There's nothing fancy about this DVD, just a straight up AB workout. No extra advertisments, talking, encouraging and no distracting models, etc...It's just you and Tom. I've been using this DVD for at least three weeks now...and No, I don't have a six pack. I'm not striving for anybody's pack. I just want stronger, leaner abs. I feel stronger so hopefully, the leaner part will show up soon.

Overrall, I like this video and all of Tom's other videos too.",1366329600,,600,4.660377358490566
8095514,5,B000C3L29I,That take little time and get the blood flowing in the morning.  Tom showed this old dog some new tricks!,1364860800,,105,4.25
8095515,5,B000C3L29I,"Ok. First thing first-the cover of this DVD misrepresents this whole awesome workout and dvd itself.  IT seems that it will be some home-made looking workout that you are trying cause you are bored and want to try something new. This workout not only is filmed very professionally, has a great sound, awesome trainer...it also allows you to pick all workouts at the same time (about 7 minutes each or 28 min total) or just pick workout 1, 2, 3 or 4...they are all different. I was very impressed with this dvd....it looks very good. The cover doesn't do it justice at all!",1361664000,,572,4.553398058252427
8095516,2,B000C3L29I,"This workout really isn't worth buying. It's three sets of just crunches. Which I already knew how to do on my own... I learned nothing new. And it's not much of a challenge. BUT, if you're a total beginner in working out & need motivation and a guy telling you ""GOOD! GOOD JOB!"" the whole time, then totally go for it. I'd recommend this dvd for older people who are out of shape.. like 35+ who just need a quick easy coach on standard crunches.",1302566400,,446,4.258823529411765
