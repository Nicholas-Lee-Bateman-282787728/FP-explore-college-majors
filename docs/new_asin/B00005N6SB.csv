7946428,4,B00005N6SB,"This was an 80s series that centered around an american sharing a flat with two other roommates from the UK.  Matthew (the vain macho man who's afraid to leave the apartment), Martin (the nerdy guy) and Mandy (the beautiful blonde who attracts losers) live together in this first of three series total.  There are six episodes in all:

Big Wednesday
Working Girls
The Great Escape
Bad Timing
Matthew - A Case For Treatment
Fame

Matthew is the brash american who thinks too highly of himself.  Martin is the wimpy guy who always gets picked on, especially by Matthew.  Mandy is the good looking blonde with great ambitions but with little to back it up.  Both men sniff at her heels but never get anywhere.  A very funny series that is different from american comedies.  Some episodes are funnier then others but all are amusing.",1202083200,,829,4.701388888888889
