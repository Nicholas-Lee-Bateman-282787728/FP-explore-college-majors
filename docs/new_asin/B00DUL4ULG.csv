8597969,5,B00DUL4ULG,"This collection is astonishing for the loving detail of the lagniappes, which are the whipped cream & cherry on top of the sundae, which is of course the films themselves. My Mom and I have fallen in love with Varda's films. Two examples will suffice. Daguerrotypes is simply a collection of her interviews with people on her street in Paris, mostly shopkeepers, mingled in with a magician's act and other activities in the neighborhood. 101 Nights is about the movies, and on particular director's love affair with them. Describing a Varda film is never quite enough. They are visually entrancing, often humorous, and always memorable. The huge plus, for anyone not fluent in French, is the subtitles. Other releases of her films, even boxed sets, are not always so considerate. Whether people know it or not, about one fifth of us are hard of hearing (in any language) and we love our captioning. Highly recommended, and if you are debating getting a multi-region player, this could in a nutshell be the persuading argument.",1430179200,5,1026,4.936416184971098
