It may be but the picture quality is so utterly terrible there's simply no point wasting money on this DVD. I didn't mind Death Screams and if it was ever released properly remastered I would buy it but I promise you, this particular release is atrocious as far as picture quality goes so please, do NOT waste your money on this DVD.",1493078400,,502,4.408602150537634

8108817,3,B000EET9I6,"I suppose most people will get this DVD for DEATH SCREAMS (aka HOUSE OF DEATH), which is fairly hard to find on DVD.

I have HOUSE OF DEATH (the title I'm used to) on both Beta and VHS. Sadly, this DVD version is of a POORER visual quality than my tape copies. Yes, it looks like a transfer from tape. A badly washed-out tape. My Beta tape, especially, has richer, deeper colors.

That said, HOUSE OF DEATH is a fairly entertaining film -- but only if you're a forgiving slasher completist. (That would include me.) It's not an especially great slasher film, but it's okay.

Here's the review I wrote for the tape version:

It's the early 1980s, and a slasher is stalking teenagers in North Carolina. You've seen it often, but I still liked this film.

It's fairly inept, low on suspense, and not too bloody. The film opens with the quick murder of two teens making out -- then nothing much happens for over an hour! A young girl is suffocated, but that's about it.

The whole first hour is just setting up events. Teenagers hang out, go to a county fair, smoke pot (some comic relief as a sheriff nearly catches them), and make plans for a summer night camp out.

They also invite their coach to their camp out. He's popular with the teens. There's even this big retarded boy who's unintentionally hilarious when he says that ""it's bad to hurt coach.""

Maybe we're supposed to think the retarded kid might be the killer? No, I'm not giving anything away. The slasher's identity surprised me. The choice seemed arbitrary. Really, it could as easily have been anyone.

So anyway, these kids camp out. Have sex. Drink. Tell ghost stories. Then the killings start. Only by now, there's only 20 minutes left in the film, with very few deaths so far. So the slasher kills quickly to rack up a large body count, as there's so little time left.

Then the slasher's identity is revealed, with a sudden flashback (right out of the blue) to ""explain"" why this person felt compelled to kill.

HOUSE OF DEATH was shot by E.O. Productions, which was Earl Owensby's low-budget North Carolina film company at the time. They also made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Day-of-Judgment/dp/B004EK6LIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Day of Judgment</a>.

HOUSE OF DEATH is an inept attempt to cash in on the slasher cycle about when it was beginning to peter out. Still, I liked this film. The women are pretty (one of them was a Playboy model). Some nice wide angle photography. Mediocre acting by a no-name cast troupe, but it suffices.

Slasher fans who don't mind a film that waits till the end for the body count to start rising should like this film.",1360540800,4,2678,4.783080260303688
8108818,5,B000EET9I6,"Now before I get into my review I'd like to tell everyone who is interested in possibly buying this dvd that it comes with 2 films! Dario Argento's Deep Red and the obscure 1981 slasher film Death Screams. Now I'm not gonna focus on Deep Red. It's the edited version and in a terrible full screen format. If you're looking for a nice copy of Argento's masterpiece go buy Blue Undergrounds terrific dvd :) you'll love it!
Death Screams on the other hand is a completely different story. This version is the only possible way to get the uncut version of the 1981 film. There is another dvd with 4 other films that is edited and blurs out all the nudity the film has! It's pretty much a tv version so do yourself a favor and skip that. I believe the UK also put out a dvd and again that as well is edited AND out of order! Senseless huh?
Now the film was released on VHS I believe in 1987 or so under the title House Of Death. Fully unedited but listen to this, even then you're getting the wrong title. Death Screams was filmed in 1981, sat on the shelves till 1983 and released to theaters under the title Death Screams. It was not until when it was finally released to VHS in the late 80's that the title was changed to House Of Death. Who knows why? But this dvd IS unedited with the proper title the film should have :)
The picture quality is sadly only average in a full screen format but for the most part it looks like a decent VHS transfer and at least you're getting the full film.
The dvd itself is a slimcase.

Now for the film itself!
Though only for the hardcore slasher film audience, Death Screams is a properly entertaining slasher bite with plenty to offer genre fans.
The plot concerns a rather large group of friends who decide after hitting their local carnival to visit the local graveyard and tell some ""scary stories"" but soon enough the rain starts and they have to take shelter in a dark and eerie house. But tonight is not their lucky night. A lunatic has been prowling the small town for days and he has a machete.
Death Screams is familiar and it does take quite a while to get going but even then I found the cast to be quite entertaining and I was surprised to see the film moved at a rather nice pace. Some scenes are surprisingly creepy and mildy original (the opening really stood out to me), the gore effects are passable and the whole film is pretty well directed by a director who clearly knows how to bring out the most in a film like this. And I bet he's also seen The Cat People one too many times for good measure. ;)
Now if I really wanted to nitpick and I really don't want to honestly, (but we have to keep it real right?) it does fall apart in the last 2 or 3 minutes or so. I won't spoil the killer not his/her motive but it will leave you scratching your head looking for answers you'll never get. And by the final scene it seems the filmmakers wanted to just wrap it up :( . So it isn't perfect. But what in life is right?

Death Screams is a really entertaining film that sadly falls apart a bit towards the end. But it's still highly worth owning for the slasher film crowd. In particular the 80's slasher collector crowd like myself :)
The dvd is cheap and you'd be better off getting it used for a really low price but honestly until a proper dvd release comes out (which is looking unlikely as of now) this is worth adding to your collection for being unedited with the proper title.
Just remember to get Deep Red seperate :p
Enjoy!",1336435200,11,3482,4.250377073906486
