8442691,4,B004V2FUWQ,"No movie captures the great Amitabh as an angry yet soulful young man better than Bemisaal. Although uniquely done for its time of release, when such blockbusters as Shakit, Khuddar, Mahaan, and Pukar hit the screen with quite a punch, Bemisaal is set to give the audience an intimate look at the very soul of Amitabh's portrayed anger. Playing a double role as both the insane older brother and the younger pediatrician, Amitabh performs fabulously in this tale of loyalty, sacrifice, and vendetta. Some of the monologues, that establish the backdrop of his character, are so well performed that one realizes that bone-crackling punches and booming voices are not the only means to express a character's inner rage. In fact, a much more emphatic appreciation is achieved through fine changes in tone and pace that enable dialogs alone to bring Amitabh's inner turmoil to bear. Of course, Lata's lilting rendition of ""Ae Ri Pavan"" coupled with Kishore's pain-infused performance of ""Kaffa Hoon"" bring to a nice finish a piece of art by Mr. Mukherjee. If you are looking for action, this is clearly NOT the movie for you. However, if you want to truly experience the rage that Amitabh has portrayed in so many different facets, you want to watch Bemisaal.",1304985600,,1254,4.947867298578199
