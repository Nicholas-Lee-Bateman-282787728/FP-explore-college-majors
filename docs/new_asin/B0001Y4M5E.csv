2042995,1,B0001Y4M5E,"I bought this film after being fascinated with What The Bleep Do We Know.

The problem with this one is that Dr. Tiller assumes his audience has a background in physics..I am showing my own ignornance in giving it one star...But I couldn't follow the dang thing even though I knew the information was true and vital...If you're a dummy like me, stick with ""Bleep""..Jack Schlatter",1158969600,21,379,4.742424242424242
2042996,4,B0001Y4M5E,"The target audience for this DVD seems to be people who like to speak the language of math and physics.  Yes, it does take you through three experiments - under controlled conditions - designed to demonstrate the influence of mind over matter, together with mathematical formulas, graphs and everything else that may be of interest to scientific community.

It is not designed for ordinary people who just want to learn how to use their minds and emotions and for that matter if you want to prove to yourself that your thoughts and emotions do influence your body and your reality, learn to focus on your goal - use the simple formula that has been mentioned at least for a couple of thousands of years and we call it ""act as if"" - by pretending that the outcome you desire to experience is real for you now - and notice what happens.

I was glad that he mentioned on this DVD one important point, which many people that work with mind-power, thoughts and intentions skip and that's that ""your emotions give that 'oomph' or power to the idea that you desire to manifest and without emotions, nothing much will happen with the thought.

I'm also glad that - when someone in the audience asked ""why sometimes thoughts manifest and sometimes they do not"" - he correctly pointed out, well, at least half of the reason and that is that people often change their minds - for a few minutes they want something and they believe it to be possible, and then the next few minutes they think ""how foolish of me to even think that such a thing could happen"" and they kill the original thought.

The other bit that he didn't mention is that the ideas we desire to manifest and impress upon the subconscious, work in conjunction with all other ideas which are already present in the subconscious - and the idea which has more energy vested in it manifests.",1117238400,281,1841,4.549848942598187

8018091,5,B0001Y4M5E,"EXCELLENT DVD!  However, be warned, it is dry.

But as a scientist and engineer, I deeply enjoyed this dvd and seeing how he set up his experiments to prove that our intentions CHANGE REALITY.

In this DVD, Tiller shows that holding the intention is important and having a strong emotion attached to the intention adds Power to the intention. This DVD shows how holding the intention has an immediate effect on reality whether it be changing the pH of a water sample, or speeding the maturation process on a colony of fruit flies.

From an empirical and scientific perspective, Tiller proves, ""WE CREATE OUR REALITY"".",1330905600,2,617,4.847619047619047
8018092,5,B0001Y4M5E,"It's a taped lecture, so don't expect any Disneyfied special effects or the like.  However, the information, experiment results and just the fact that Tiller is undertaking the effort, was for me an invaluable confirmation of my own beliefs regarding existence.  Though a good deal of the science was above my head, Tiller is a personable speaker and easy to listen to and follow along with.",1207526400,2,391,4.909090909090909
8018093,1,B0001Y4M5E,"This is essentially a videotaping of a college lecture (and I kid you not, using an overhead projector).  He is talking about the power of intention (making carefully sure to distinguish that with wishing), and how some day we may use quantum physics to use our minds to change things in the physical world (not totally unlike telekinesis).  In fact, there have been some experiments that actually caused hairs to bend or something of that import.  Dull, boring, slow, this could be incredible subject matter, but the presentation quality is hideous.",1178496000,4,550,5.021978021978022
8018094,1,B0001Y4M5E,"Enjoyed Dr. Tiller in What the Bleep? however, this is a video taping of a lecture he gave where he uses an overhead projector.  The production qualities were sooooo poor and information presented so slowly and drawn out that I couldn't watch the whole show.

Very dissappointing. Get What the Bleep, Down the Rabbit Hole instead and you'll get the same info in a much more enjoyable and understandable presentation.",1175472000,15,416,4.928571428571429
8018095,4,B0001Y4M5E,"I watched ""The Conscious Acts Of Creation - The emergence of a new physics"" by Dr. William A. Tiller, Phd, one of the guys on the What the Bleep and the Down the Rabbit hole movies. To those who say the science of concentrated intentions with emotion not doing anything - they have 3 boring experiments, such as using yogis to change the ph of water, or make fruit flys grow faster, etc. The amazing thing is - they had to keep the control samples in faraday cages - if they did not, the (eg) ph would change on both samples - as if the 2 samples were lnked! Lots of boring physics - and lots of subjective thinking - but, all in all, it does give lots of science to the topics covered in ""What the Bleep"", the ""Secret"", religions, and conditoning one's mind.  Not a funny movie or a fun one, it's a lecture that is boring but shows what we always suspected - at least leads us to what we already kind of knew!",1168646400,23,910,4.141242937853107
8018096,5,B0001Y4M5E,"The above reviews do not give this presentation justice. If you are looking to be entertained, get 'What the Bleep' which presents tidbits of scientific research in a fun way. But, if you are a skeptic and prone to criticize any research regarding the power of the mind/psychic phenomena, then get this dvd. Dr. Tiller takes the viewer through the details of the controlled experiments proving that the mind can indeed affect physical objects, even living beings, to a highly mathematically significant degree.

No, it's not terribly entertaining. That is irrelevant. What is important about this presentation is that a reputable scientist is presenting genuine scientific and mathematical data on a subject that has been difficult to quantify and prove.

This is a highly important work and I recommend it for any skeptics with a background in math and science.",1168646400,60,862,5.15
8018097,2,B0001Y4M5E,"I'm a big fan of ""What the Bleep"" and ""The Secret"" but the scientific edge of this was a little to technical and lacked the entertainment value.",1168128000,5,144,4.37037037037037
