1045862,5,6305562784,My mother collects Gene Kelly movies and she has every movie and TV special that we could find. My mother watches this film almost every day. Besides Gene dancing and a good love story. The movie shows how people dealt with millions of GI's returning after WWII and having no place to live. This is a must buy for Gene Kelly Fans.,1310947200,,330,4.338709677419355
1045863,5,6305562784,This little gem needs to be released on DVD. Kelly has three great dances and his comic timing is superb. He is simply charming in the role of Leo Gogerty.,1265500800,4,155,4.2
1045864,4,6305562784,Good or bad should be ours to decide! Unfortunately we cant because we don't have VHS players! I don't know about you but I have DVD and Plasma tv! I need this movie to be put on DVD MGM !!!!,1185840000,2,191,3.8
1045865,2,6305562784,"Just how bad, I wondered, could a big MGM musical from 1947 with Gene Kelly really be?  Had to see it.
MISGUIDED is the word that comes to mind. Louis B. Mayer's hot new ""find"" Marie McDonald isn't really awful --merely bad.
As intially filmed, the movie was NOT a musical; it contained the opening ""pre-war"" dance number to set up the relationship(it's actually very nice and atmospheric--real 40's-type romance);  Gene's fabulous dancing is explained much later in the film when he say's ""I might go back to dancing"". After he returns from the war (the bulk of the story), the film then becomes a romantic comedy, with the understated, whimsical, and charming Mr. Kelly chasing after this dullard wife of his.  The writers threw in all of the ""clever"" stock character types:  daffy parents (Charles Winniger and Spring Byington), tough, wise old grandma (Jean Adair), cynical, supercilious butler (Clinton Sundberg), etc, etc...but the film never goes ANYWHERE with these people because it is so ineptly written.  The dialogue sounds incredibly phony:  whenever Gene and his wife open their mouths, they spout clever, philosophical one-liners and zingers that are oh-so MEANINGFUL....it really gets painful. And the courtroom scene near the end is utterly pointless.
Now what if.....the producers, after seeing the early rushes, decided to dump Ms. McDonald and write the character out of the script entirely.....the story would then center around grandma's derelict mansion...the symbol of her bygone youth and happy days gone to ruin....and the sense of joy involved in remodeling the house into the new, communal dwelling for all of the young vets and their families.  Grandma's final days would then acquire a new sense of meaning, as the old house would now symbolize a renewal of her own youth and ideals.  Gene would then meet the war widow Peggy (Phyllis Thaxter), whose husband was an army buddy of his. The relationship between Gene, Phyllis and the little boy (Jimmy Hunt) could then blossom, instead of being aborted as it is in the film---  now THAT would have been a cool movie!!!
But, alas, no.  The producers took the finished film, realized what a DUD they had on their hands, and decided the only chance of salvaging it was to interpolate a few musical numbers that would allow Gene to do what he does so brilliantly.  Hence, the charming ""Fido and Me"", ""Statue Dance"" and the scene with the kids and the house under construction-----all added on later and, incidentally, some of Mr. Kelly's personal favorite dance sequences.
One last observation---the kid's dance scene features one of the most ludicrously inept continuity edits ever scene on film!  Gene and grandma are on the porch (in yet ANOTHER philosophical exchange), and they refer several times to the SUNSET in the distance.  The light is low, a really nice dappled shade effect---and as grandma leaves, a workman on a ladder asks Gene to hold his bucket....SUDDENLY, the scene is FLOODED with blinding sunlight---it's daytime again, since the producers needed to insert an emergency dance sequence with Kelly and the kids!  It's absurd!
Could have been a great film, without the whole wife thing.  But any serious fan of Gene Kelly's should own it, as he really carries the film with his great charisma and presence.
(Fans of character actors will enjoy Dick Wessel and Maxine Gates as the Navy guy and his wife in the first post-war scene, and ""Mickey Mouse Club's"" Jimmy Dodd and Ellen Corby seen briefly in the house remodeling scenes).",1018915200,25,3523,4.998290598290598

1046036,5,6305562784,"This was done shortly after ""Anchors Aweigh"" and this is a beautifully written song and dance B&W movie for Gene Kelly. ""Fido and Me"" is a favorite number as well as his song and dance routine with the children like in ""An American in Paris"" except they were singing and dancing to nursery rhymes. It is absolutely delightful the magic Gene has on screen with children. Humorous sketches and love scenes make this a ""must have"" for the Gene Kelly fans.",1357689600,9,452,4.592592592592593

1046038,5,6305562784,"I have been on the look out for this movie for many years. Being a huge fan of Gene Kelly since childhood, this movie has always aluded me. I first saw part of Gene's dance number on one of those little extras on another DVD. That did it the hunt began. I didn't even have the title! Long story short I bought this movie to see Gene's extraordinary dance number done on a construction site. WOW, what a gymnist, what a dancer. This is a must have for anyone that loves Gene Kelly or great dance choreography that only Gene can do.",1347926400,6,530,4.205882352941177

7891286,4,6305562784,I'm a dancer and I love Gene Kelly.  He was right in saying this was his best dancing movie.  The plot was so so but he was young and at his height.  He danced magnificently!  It was worth sitting on my chair and watching on my desktop.,1524441600,,236,3.9574468085106385

7891290,5,6305562784,"Gene Kelly said his favorite dance scenes were in this movie. I can think of at least three places in it that might back up that claim, particularly his dancing with an engaging, likable dog named Chris, but who, as Gene is the common man, is the common dog, answering to ""Fido"". In his Classic Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gives it two stars, but his standards are very high, and lots of his two star films are very watchable. He says it was a ""notorious flop in it's day, but not all that bad"".
One could speculate as to why it might have flopped, but this is not your typical, Hollywood film in which after three divorces and two annulments the poor little rich girl finds the right man, and that deviation from the formula may have bothered some people. Also, while I generally agree with Maltin at least enough to take a chance on his recommended movies (as long as they are old and funny), and am not in agreement with most other critics in any way, I of course don't fall in with him right down the line. He is dismissive, for instance, of one of my favorite films, ""St. Benny the Dip"". Nevertheless, I don't watch anything without consulting my film Bible, his Classic Movie Guide.
The title of this film is quite lackluster, and practically marks it as an ""also ran"" rather than a Dark Horse. But there are a lot of bad puns, throw away lines, empty air space, awkward moments, and confusing bits in some movies he would give more stars to, whereas this one has some crackerjack dialogue, as from, for instance, the butler. Some of it reminds me of a Lubitsch musical (high praise indeed). What the characters seem, if anything, is somewhat undeveloped, especially the father, which wouldn't happen if he were, say Jimmy Stewart or John Wayne. Because of this, the audience falls back on sort of stock responses. I can't really tell the returning vet feels this way, but I imagine that's how a returning vet would feel, so I round out the sort of cardboard portrayal on the screen with these assumptions, as with, for instance, Gene's (Leo's) best friend and fellow vet. A movie where the fellow servicemen are revealed as complete characters, by contrast, is ""On the Town"". That said, one can only watch ""On the Town"" and ""Follow the Fleet"" so many times without wanting to discover a new film to watch, of which this is a welcome entry.",1484352000,2,2346,4.535377358490566

7891293,5,6305562784,Gene Kelly's dance routines were creatively delightful.  There was no end to his talent.  The statue didn't need to come to life to seem real.  I especially love his interaction with the children.  The young girls probably developed a crush on him by the end of the picture.,1437264000,5,274,4.645833333333333
