8349458,5,B0021SGO90,"As part of the History Channel's ""Haunted"" series comes Tombstone. I thought it was really good and was pretty much an overview of some of the most talked about ""haunted"" locations and a few of the stories. It was well done with my favorite narrator from the series, not ""Worf"" from STNG. He did some of the very first in the series.
~ A Gentleman comes to terms that his gal ""Cleopatra"" has cheated on him while he was working in the mines near Tombstone to save money for a wedding and future. He's enraged and the only thing on his mind after the hurt is to kill.
~ The Aztec House is not a place for women, of any kind
~ The Buford House has a ghost, thought to be that of the gentleman who took his own life over the cheating girlfriend.
~ The OK Corral is also talked about and may have one of the Clanton Gang members haunting his final shootout in October 1881.
~ Two Saloon Gals, Gold dollar and Margarita, go at it over Gold Dollar's boyfriend. Margarita pays the ultimate price for messing around with him.
A very good program, but I wish it was a little longer than the 50 or so minutes. These were made for the TV program and look pretty good here on DVD. If you are a fan of the series, you should get this one. ~",1439078400,,1227,4.138075313807532
