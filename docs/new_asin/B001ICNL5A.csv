3647857,5,B001ICNL5A,"I am the son of a vietnam veteran.  A man who fought selflessly for 3 years in that war as marine grunt and as an F-4 pilot.  He, eaten alive by alcoholism stemming from PTSD, was one of the many post-war casualties of a conflict that still misunderstood by many Americans to this day.  I served myself in the military so I could relate to this film on many levels.  It challenged me, disturbed me, angered me but mostly, it touched me deeply. As we welcome home thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines now and in the years to come, I hope that 1) families of servicemen and women can see this film so they have an insight into the struggle of those who have gone off to war 2) servicemen and women see this film so that they realize that whether one's calls ""a soldier's heart"", ""shell shock"", ""battle fatigue"" or PTSD, the psychic injuries of war are real.  The injuries may not be apparent on the battlefield always and they may not be sensed during discharge procedures.  But they can destroy lives: the veteran, spouses, children and friends.  This film is a dramatic and touching story that shows the hurt and ultimately the triumph of veterans who are supported in the efforts to heal their Soldier's Heart.  See it, talk about it and reach out to a vet and thank them for their service.",1225411200,,1305,4.476793248945148
3647858,5,B001ICNL5A,"I have to tell you I was completely moved, although I very much identified in a different way. With my own struggles, today I have the same kind of experiences as Elliot. You don't have to fight in a war to experience post traumatic stress disorder. The fiery outbursts are common in my life. It was scary, really scary, to realize that I was truly looking at myself as I watched him. And just as with Elliot, through self-acceptance, I believe that I, too, will have the opportunity to come home. So you can imagine, at the end, I was completely broken up. Which was good. And necessary. Because it allowed me to identify where I'm coming from, and to see where I will be, as I continue to allow myself to heal, by accepting help from family and friends, just as Elliot did. Beautiful.",1225411200,2,786,4.427586206896552
3647859,5,B001ICNL5A,This is a heart-rending movie which paints a realistic picture of a Vietnam Veteran who is still living out the pain of war.  He begins to unravel the roots of his suffering as he takes care of his dying father.  The viewer gets a compassionate window into his struggle and how he begins to resolve it with the help of his family and loved ones.  The filmmaker truly understands the true nature of PTSD as a soul wound and an identity disorder.  A must-see for anyone concerned about the damaging effects of all war and violence.,1225238400,,529,4.479166666666667

Soldiers Heart is a phrase that comes from the American Civil War, it means Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Example ""That man is acting like that because he has soldiers heart.""
Brian Delate goes inward bound in this movie using the heart and soul as guide posts to bring his audience to a deeper understanding of how we are all affected by war. Not only soldiers want to forget what happens in war, so many of us in this country allow a trance of denial to steel our memories. Brian kindly reminds us that war did happen and that we all are responsible for the after affects. Most movie makers believe that the theater seats need to shake with over amplified violence to penetrate the callused movie goers who like speed readers only slow down to pay attention when the action starts. Soldiers Heart seeps into you slowly it's a movie with half lives that comes again and again sometimes in the shower or before you go to sleep. After this movie you might even see when you look in the mirror that you have been affected by war just like the normal folks in this movie.  You do not have to be a vet to want to see this movie in fact I think instead of the crashing blow that most war movies rely on  to hook their audience Soldiers Heart is  a gentle stroke on the civilian cheek to wake up.

3647861,5,B001ICNL5A,"The title  is everything you need to know-- this film is all heart. Which is not to suggest SOLDIER'S HEART ever journeys into the realm of sentimentalism... it does not. It is a real film, made by a real soldier, who went through a brutal war, and came out the other side. You do not need to be (or love) a veteran to see (and love) this film. But, on the flip side, if you are a veteran, or know a veteran, then this is positively one to be watched, discussed, reflected on, then watched again.",1224720000,,496,4.166666666666667
3647862,5,B001ICNL5A,"Soldiers Heart is a wonderful, moving story of a Vietnam Veteran who is living, painfully at times, with the invisible war injury of post-traumatic stress disorder.  The war is over, but the hurtful long-term effects live on in our returning soldiers.  There are tender, sweet moments in the film, as well as disturbing battle flash backs.  The relationships this Vet has with family and friends are complex. While watching Soldiers Heart you cannot help but think about Veterans you know and wonder how much pain they are suffering through as a result of PTSD.  This film makes me proud to be an American.  Veterans are to be held in the highest esteem.  This film stays with you for quite a long time.  It is superbly written.  I have recommended this film to friends and family, and they all gave it 5 stars.  I sure you will, too.",1224720000,2,834,4.619047619047619
3647863,5,B001ICNL5A,"If you love movies whose plots gently unfold like a 40s classic film rather than starting off with a bang, i.e. copulating couples or detonated buildings or both in the first five minutes you will love Soldier's Heart, a minutely observed meltdown of a Vietnam vet following the death of his WWII vet father with whom he has never discussed the war. This film is also noteworthy thanks to the performances of Brian Delate (whose career I've followed for a long time - see IMDB.com) and Cady McClane (of All My Children fame).

8310793,1,B001ICNL5A,"I had great expectations for this movie.  I wanted to get a better understanding of how a Veteran with PTSD feels, reacts, and learns to cope after coming home from the war.  This movie barely touched upon the issue.  Sure, the main character had struggles, but they were mostly financial.  And, in the end, everyone lived happily ever after.  This is not reality.

And the acting was bad.  I stayed with the movie until the end hoping for something, anything to give me more insight into a Veteran's struggles.  It did not.

Very disappointed.",1389225600,,544,4.702127659574468
8310794,5,B001ICNL5A,"Exceeded our expectations...tears, laughter, heartache, joy...healing..  Like Ed Tick's book, War and the Soul, this excellent film was tough to pick up and tough to put down and absolutely worth sinking deep into.  We will be talking about it for a very long time and sharing with many others...our generation and the young ones.  Thankyou doesn't seem like enough words to all involved but it's a good place to start!",1381363200,,419,4.957142857142857
8310795,5,B001ICNL5A,"This movie is unlike any other movie about the psychological effects of war.  Besides the wonderful acting, it is well written in a heartwarming manner which deals with the issue of PTSD in a most realistic and sensitive form.  The stress of war on a soldier is something that affects everyone and everything around the soldier, and Brian Delate has done an exemplary job of showing the viewer how the effects of war eats at the sldier's soul.  No matter what experiences a soldier has gone thru, healing akes time. This movie should be widely distributed as a tool to educate more people about the issue of PTSD.",1258329600,,613,4.657407407407407
8310796,5,B001ICNL5A,"This is a beautiful film, made with love and care.  It is moving, insightful and tender.  The performances are superb. I recommend it highly.

8310797,5,B001ICNL5A,"This film surprised me because it unfolded so slowly and delicately.  Although it certainly deals very much with the vet experience, and PTSD, it is at its heart a film about fathers and sons, and silence. I feel that anyone can find something to relate to in this film, and that is has a very human feel to it--not heavy-handed or alienating for the viewer at all. Good storytelling, good performances, and a film worth seeing.",1226016000,,428,4.631578947368421
8310798,5,B001ICNL5A,"I was stunned by this movie, the storytelling is smart, thoughtful and deeply moving. The directing is just simply beautiful. Great performance by Cady McClain. I highly recommend this movie, not only to soldiers or veterans, but to everyone who loves and appreciates great film-making. -Frank Kirstein, Creative Director, Citizen Pictures",1225929600,,339,5.666666666666667
8310799,4,B001ICNL5A,"The opening sound of a helicopter circling overhead echoes in the memory of a Viet Nam veteran as he drives down a peaceful hometown street. This film shows the price soldiers and their families pay for our freedom. The Civil War, WWI, WWII, Viet Nam eras call trauma by different names: Soldier's Heart, Shell Shock, Battle Fatigue, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Brian Delate's movie describes the veteran's universal experience whichever war he or she carries inside, which rages long after the battle field is left behind. The lead character's acting career gives the movie humorous moments. The insider's look at casting and call backs is a welcomed balance to the serious story.",1225670400,,689,5.106194690265487
8310800,5,B001ICNL5A,"A Soldier's Heart's strength comes from its ability to pull you along in its wake without dragging you. Where other post Vietnam War Hollywood offerings have often dealt with the subject matter of traumatic stress in a heavy handed way, this movie builds to its conclusion by showing a man's life slowly unraveling bit by bit. The ensemble cast is very convincing and the fact that there aren't any Hollywood heavyweights featured adds a real life quality that makes the movie stay with you long after the credits roll. If this movie doesn't make you want to call up your Congressman to demand that more be done to help vets adjust to post war life, nothing will.",1225584000,,663,4.6752136752136755
8310801,4,B001ICNL5A,"This was not the mainstream film that Hollywood has taught me to expect. That was such a great thing for me.  It was so much easier to relate to the actors and their unbelievably difficult stories.  The experiences related in the film weren't glamorized which many films would be prone to do.  I am not a veteran and I don't really know that many, but I care about what war does to all of the people who go and fight.  This is why I highly recommend this film.  It is filled with insight, poignancy and detail that should be understood and felt by every citizen.",1225584000,,562,4.314285714285714
8310802,5,B001ICNL5A,"After watching Soldiers Heart, I finally realized what my husband had been through as a Vietnam Veteran. He never talked to me about the time he spent in the war. I wish he had lived to watch this movie with me, because it would have opened the door to having that conversation. I highly recommend this movie to Veterans of any war and to their families. Watch it, then talk about it. It will help you to understand and to heal.
Kudos to Brian Delate for putting his own heart and soul into the making of this important film.",1225497600,,525,4.313131313131313
