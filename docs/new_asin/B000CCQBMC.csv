8097456,5,B000CCQBMC,"A rather thought provoking drama, In My Father's Den showcases the acting talents of it's cast perfectly. It also shows that New Zealand's film industry can do more than just quirky comedy, which it does admirably. The whole cast were excellent, but the impact of this piece really depended on the central duo. Matthew Macfadyen, as the out of place and uncomfortable returning escapee Paul, and Emily Barclay, as the insecure but seemingly confident sixteen year old Celia, nail their performances beautifully. These are two very complex individuals who think that they know their stories, and the viewer gets sucked into their self-belief. I loved and hated the two central characters in turn. And then the twist blew my train off the rails.",1450224000,,743,5.048780487804878
