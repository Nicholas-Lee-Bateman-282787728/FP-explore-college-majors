1023568,4,6305377014,"A tragic look into the life of a zombie. Frightening in a psychological sense, with a strong story and good characters. This film took me by surprise, because it's inventive, and doesn't try to spin the same old tale over again. I, Zombie could probably be categorized as a drama, instead of a horror flick, if it wasn't for the gore and zombie theme. Well worth your time if you don't mind an involved plot, and character development.",947116800,,435,4.589743589743589
1023569,1,6305377014,"Fangoria better be careful as to what they put their name on, cause trash like this movie is gonna bring their reputation down into the gutter. Most of this film is spent watching one guy go about his business, as he is  slowly turning into a zombie. The film never seems to go anywhere,and for  something to come out under Fangoria's banner, you would think there would  be more horror to the story, but unfortunately there isn't. Boring, boring,  boring, is the best I can say about it. Very little special effects. Mostly  just on his zombie makeup. This is one movie I couldn't reccomend to  anyone.",945561600,,603,4.588785046728972
1023570,1,6305377014,"Coffin Joe, for your information, this is indeed the FOURTH release from Fangoria films. I was reading FANGO when your momma was in diapers! Well maybe not quite that long, but I bring it up to make a point. Fango films  used to be cool. Remember ""Mindwarp""? (Pay close attention here  Coffin Joe) How about ""Children of the Night""? Okay,  ""Severed Ties"" wasn't too good, but you have to admit it was  original. Now FANGO has gone for the ""Full Moon Entertainment""  type of schlock-horror. CHEEEEEEEEEEZEBAAAAAAAALLL! I, Zombie is a perfect  example of how to waste your time. Mostly I'm talking about the filmmakers.  Do you guys even WATCH movies? Do you have any idea how to tell a story? I  will give them this small amount of credit, during the commentary track,  they repeatedly cut the film down for how stupid and nonsensical it is. A  lot of tracks do that, but in this case you couldn't agree more! Instead  rent: Dead Pit, Re-Animator, Bride of Re-Animator, Night of the Living  Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Night of the Zombies, Return of  the Living Dead (1&2), Shockwave, Zombie  -and be happy, because these  movies don't get better than these.",941500800,3,1171,4.671568627450981
1023571,5,6305377014,"I bought this DVD knowing nothing more about it than the title. The fact that Amazon offered it for a very fair price also helped. And there is a lot to say about this film. The creative way director Andrew Parkinson  worked with an obvious low budget. The wonderful camera angles. The sublime  editing. The undercooled directing. The beautiful and suspenseful use of  music. The wonderful acting (but then: they're british, so what would you  expect...). The holding back on too much gore. The superb unsettling  atmosphere that is never broken. But saying too much would give too much  away of a fantastically told fantastic story. I always like films that are  directed by the writer - in this case Mr. Parkinson even takes care of the  production and the music. This way we know everything is as it was  originally intended, and no one else could have done it any better. I have  seen a great share of horror films, and in particular zombie films have my  interest for some unknown reason. The theme can be handled in many  different ways, as we can see in flicks like Lucio Fulci's 1979  masterpiece, many wonderfully entertaining Troma films, the brilliant  George Romero trilogy and Todd Sheets' pathetic attempts at filmmaking.  Fangoria's ""I ZOMBIE"" adds a whole new dimension and direction to  all this by giving us a film that is about someone who through no fault of  his own becomes infected with some sort of virus by another person (in a  brilliant suspence-filled edge-of-your-seat scene) and slowly develops a  hunger for human flesh. He is not dead, however, and certainly not undead.  We are dealing with a living, intelligent Zombie who is aware of what is  happening to him. That is all I am gonna say. It is a film on a very human  level, that shows us emotion, human relationships and three dimensional  characters. It has rather a slow pace, but that adds magnificently to the  suspense of the film. Many unexpected twists in the plot keep you  constantly wondering what is going to happen next. ""I ZOMBIE"" is  not much short of a masterpiece. The DVD also gives us a 'behind the  scenes' featurette, a few deleted scenes, a commentary by the director, an  interview with Fangoria's editor and a preview for the next of Fangoria's  release: ""LADY OF THE LAKE"" (can't wait for that one, if ""I  ZOMBIE"" is anything to go by). You get a lot for your money, and no  horrorfan should do without this one!!",928368000,2,2424,4.68646080760095
1023792,3,6305377014,"This movie is NOT going to appeal to a lot of fans of zombie movies.  This film is a lot smarter than the average zombie flick, although at times it does get a bit dry.

Our hero is a researcher and, in case you hadn't guessed, becomes a zombie.  Unlike most zombies, however, he seems to hold on to his intellect.  What follows is his behind-the-scenes look at the (un)life of a zombie.  He chronicles the pain, the needs for kills, the steps he takes to hide his nature and his gradual descent into madness as he comes to grips with the life he's lost.

The film was done on no budget and it shows.  The score, though, is surprisingly effective.  The one knock I have - and the reason I could only give it three stars - is the disappointing ending.  Granted, it didn't give us the ending that I thought sure was coming, so I can give the film credit for that ""twist"", but that's largely because it just sort of ends.  If you've ever seen ""No Country For Old Men"", you know what I mean - it's as if they could decide how to end the film so they just sort of stopped shooting.

Still, an interesting change of pace for zombie flick fans.",1294876800,,1137,4.193548387096774
1023793,3,6305377014,"Lame.

Sorry. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't Bad...exactly...but for a zombie film it is lacking. I gave it three stars, mainly for the good characterization and such. It is a character driven affair and in this it excels, but if you are looking for Action, keep looking.

The other problem is the gore. To much of it in my opinion, and worse yet, most of it is Not done well. Gore for gore sake works, but make it convincing, please.

If you want a more ""arty"" ""My dinner with a newly dead guy"" type film, then by all means check it out. If you want something with more action, pass.",1191196800,,589,4.241071428571429

1023795,4,6305377014,"this movie is unlike any other zombie film ive come into contact with, its a psycholgical movie that the lead character happens to be turning zombie.the effects a understandable for low budget but this movie deserves a look for other reasons. The story leaves you with not alot of closure but you feel satisfied because you know its best that way. The beginning,middle & end are all done well. Charcter building was just right.

1023796,3,6305377014,"This is an Interesting film. It's sad in a lot of ways and humanizes the zombie state by moving you to feel for the main characters past as a human, and future as a zombie.

1023797,3,6305377014,"i had this on VHS and finally decided to watch it again after a few years of sitting in a box in my basement. i loved the basic idea. the movie even went so far as to show what happens to a zombie when he tries to pleasure himself with a little jerk action (it would probably be the worst thing out of the entire ordeal).

i didn't have much expectations, but i was somewhat surprised at the acting. i'm not talking about the victims, they were bad. i'm talking about the main character. he actually put on quite a good performance. i was impressed how he accurately portrayed the suffering of a man who is dying but cannot die.

the only problem i really had was the pace was just too damn slow. i understand it takes some time to show the character's suffering, but this movie was bordering on tedium. that is the only reason i had to drop this movie a couple of stars.",1155254400,,871,4.209580838323354
1023798,3,6305377014,"Basic Plot: The main character is hiking in an unknown area when he is bitten by a strange and obviously very ill young woman. He is forced into the lifestyle of a hermit when physical and mental decay sets in, as well as a strong urge to kill others and eat their bodies.

With a decent amount of gore (including a few scenes that'll definitely make you squirm), above-average acting for a low-budget B-movie, and an undeniably original and fresh concept for a zombie flick, ""I Zombie"" certainly deserves a rental. A purchase, on the other hand, you should think twice about. I found the storyline to be a bit tedious and the overall feel of the film to be very amature (which I suppose could be a good thing for some B-fans, but this was almost student-film level). It's irresistible to any zombie fan such as myself, and I'm glad I saw it. Originality is very intriguing to any viewer, and this certainly has that. But it doesn't have much more to separate from any other straight-to-DVD horror flick. And who says that's a bad thing?",1128470400,5,1037,4.545454545454546
1023799,5,6305377014,"This film, while slow in pace, gives the viewer introspective into the zombie's own existence.  A well crafted character driven story of loss (on more than one level) and self loathing wrapped tightly in a fine package of well placed gore.

Visually this low budget film comes off quite well, the make-up isn't hokey.  If you are a zombie fan and you like something beyond just a gore fest try it.",1124928000,4,397,4.563380281690141
1023800,5,6305377014,This is an interesting and original take on zombie flicks. The story is told from the perspective of a person who is slowly turning into a zombie... the thoughts and degenerative process that happens when turning into a zombie are especially interesting to this reviewer. I give it high marks for its gusto and orginality. It is obviously low production... like a film school film... but I believe it exceeds the expectations of such films.

This film was great!  I read some of the other reviews before I purchased this film and almost passed it by.  Other than this flick, I have seen and own every zombie and cannibal film available.  This movie isn't scary.  The gore factor isn't as you would expect for a zombie film... don't get me wrong, there's gore...  That's not what this film is about.  ""I, Zombie"" describes the process of actually turning into a zombie...  how one becomes isolated from society and slowly decays (physically and MENTALLY).  I love all the zombie films, but this one takes it to a different level.  A MUST for zombie fans.  If you want a really scary movie or a lot of gore, search elsewhere.",1048464000,13,802,4.595744680851064
1023883,5,6305377014,"I rented this without hearing or knowing anything about it.
I enjoy comparing stories and make-up work on zombie movies.  I was amazed at the intensity of the story and became so involved with it that I forgot to critique the make-up work.  I was refreshed to find a zombie movie with an unpredictable story that kept me entertained and interested from beginning to end.  I find it rare to call a horror movie story and mood flawless these days, like I consider i,zombie.  When I finally saw it for the second time I was still amazed at the lack of corniness in its love story and lack of common uses of a zombie in a movie.  It was on the second viewing that I noticed the gore could've looked more realistic on some scenes, but at the same time I was still convinced that the movie was unlike many horror movies I have ever seen.  The feel is depressing and the music only enhances this mood.  This movie fits my thoughts that sometimes a story can be enough, and surpass the necessity of flashy effects and loud sounds.

1023884,3,6305377014,"As the cover implies this is a ZOmbie film (flesh eating Dead).  Most of them use bad acting (or dubbing in many cases), loads of gore, and some strange atmosphere.  THis movie takes a different approach to the Zombie tale involoving a guy who is going steady with his girlfriend, is a photgrapher, and british (or at least new england). One day as he is taking some pictures of Nature he stumbles upon some ruins.  WHile expoloring them he sees what looks like a dead girl.  HE goes to help her and he is bit as she is a zombie.  Taking cue from later ROmero films he is infected with a virus that will make him decay and crave human flesh.  Trying to resist these urges he soon relizes that his life is in a downward spiral.  He kills and eats in his place where he has plastic on the floor as to not stain the carpet. Than theres the infamouse masturbation scene.
OVerall this is a cult film.  It is hard to judge something like this because like many movies out there they require almost a cult following to enjoy.  IT's not a bad film considering it to be low budget, yet at the same time it's not the greatest thing to cross in to the Zombie Genre.

This is not really a zombie movie in the traditional sense. The zombie is not a walking corpse like those in the Romero or Fulci films, rather he is a living person whose body is decaying and who must eat human flesh in order to stop the agony that the virus causes him.
The story is told from the point of veiw of Mark and instead of being portrayed as a monster, he is seen as a lonely, pityful character that demands the sympathy of the viewer.

7889042,5,6305377014,"I can't recall exactly how i was turned on to this movie some years ago, but it has remained one of my all-around favorites; particularly of the zombie genre. It exposes the truly nightmarish potential and depth of such a story as becoming one of the undead. It accomplishes this by expanding on the entire idea of ""rotting"" and everything falling apart: physical decomposition, the breakdown of a partnership and social relations, mental anguish, and the will to survive slowly dissipating...And the thing is, i don't think i'm conflating this or reading too much into it in order to take what i have away from the film. It is completely successful in creating a somber atmosphere, in part because it is DIY guerrilla-style and mockumentary shooting. ""the Chronicles of Pain"" is a very apt sub-title.

The music is cool and suits the tone very well, most of it being 8-track recordings (and what better to compliment a 16mm camera?). The gore scenes, though sparsely scattered about, look fantastic. The drill scene is particularly gruesome. It's interesting to see how carefully the main character goes about claiming his victims - leaving some alive in an effort to emotionally connect with people, ignoring other potential victims for fear of said connection, being physically overpowered by another, feeling a great deal of remorse for some, and desperately/fiendishly devouring others, and always taking precautions with their dismemberment and disposal. It all just adds to the realness/rawness of the story and its delivery.

Yes, it occasionally becomes redundant, and yes sometimes there are inconsistencies in make-up and such, but that's a nearly inescapable aspect of low budget film-making. Besides, there are only so many ways you can writhe around or sit silently. At the very least, you have to appreciate the filmmakers' efforts in originality, creating an inventive and ambitious tale of transformation.

If you're looking for a cross between Nekromantik and An American Werewolf in London, or are a fan of low budget horror in general, please do yourself a favor and at least rent/request this from your local video store.",1342915200,,2142,5.1671469740634

The entire film is well made and it's not a bad film, but it needs some energy because the slow pacing hinders the film a bit.  It's about a guy who ventures into the countryside and is bitten by a sickly woman in an abandoned house.  The bite is infectious and he slowly begins to decay, and this leads him to eating human flesh.  I gave it three stars at first, but it seems to improve with another viewing.  Tom Parkison also made a film called DEAD CREATURES.  That film is well done, but it also has a slow pace that hinders the film. The tone of the film is quite morbid, and some may find it to be depressing. The violence and gore tries to be impactful and grim; the gore isn't fun type gore that you will find in many other zombie flicks. I thought the directing was petty good, but it lacks action and isn't recommended if you're looking for a fun party type zombie film with a lively tone. Some of the soundtracks may also be considered kind of depressing to some. There's no nudity in the film.
