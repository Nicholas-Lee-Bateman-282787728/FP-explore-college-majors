3685665,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I had the pleasure of seeing half of the cast live three months before Rent closed and I was blown away! Eden was a powerful Maureen and I could feel the love she felt for Joanne, something I never saw in the movie although Tracie Thoms was a brilliant Joanne in the movie and I'm sure also in the show. The rest of the cast also impressed me and I will definately be buying this dvd for myself to relive the moment when I saw Rent!",1231459200,,432,4.034883720930233
3685666,5,B001LMAKAQ,"As a long time Renthead I couldn't wait to see Live on Broadway.  It was all I expected and while I was the only one in the theater to MOOOO during Maureen's performance in the lot, it was still a blast.  I only have one complaint.  There were times when there was too many close up shots and I wish I could have seen the whole stage such as during La Vie Boheme.  Finally I waited in anticipation to see how they would honor Jonathan Larson and as I expected I ended up crying.  Always remember ""No Day But Today""",1230768000,,514,4.1
3685667,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I was one of the lucky ones who happily spent $20 per ticket for the limited engagement showing of this film a few months ago.  If you are one of those people who never saw the play live on stage, but saw the Chris Columbus film version, then this is what you MISSED when you saw the Hollywood movie.  Start to finish, it's filmed live on stage during the final Broadway performance, and the energy is phenomenal.  Granted, it's NOT the ""original cast"" (Anthony Rapp and friends, who long since departed the production), but it IS performed by some of the finest and most enthusiastic young performers Broadway has to offer today.  Watch this version, then go back and watch the Chris Columbus movie version, and ask yourself, ""What the heck was Chris Columbus THINKING when he cut songs out, relocated songs out of sequence, and ADDED DIALOGUE to replace songs?""

And then go find a national or regional touring company production, pay the $50 - 100 per ticket, and live la vie boheme the way it was meant to be lived!",1230422400,2,1019,4.576923076923077
3685668,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I have seen the musical RENT three times now (fourth time when it comes to my city in May).  I also saw this film last September when it was released under the Sony HOT TICKET.  It was amazing and fabulous and heartwrenching, and everything I hoped it would be.  I loved every second of this movie and my daughters and I cried all the way through the credits. I can't wait.",1230249600,,373,4.225352112676056
3685669,5,B001LMAKAQ,"When I saw Rent Filmed Live On Broadway, I'd already seen Rent twice actually live on Broadway, and I'd seen the movie three times. Every one of them is great, and each one is a different experience.

What I loved about this was that you got such a close up view of the action. I can't say it was like I was there, but it was completely worth it. It gives the musical a whole new insight. In this, I saw things I wouldn't have seen even if I had front row seats at Rent.

I completely recommend it for any Rent fan. It's no substitute for the actual show, but with it being closed on Broadway, this is a great way for Rent to live on.",1230163200,2,634,3.984251968503937
3685670,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I saw both the show on stage and the highly stylized film version and having now experienced this performance, filmed live on Broadway at the end of the show's run, I now truly realize just how short the film version comes to really capturing the essence of what Jonathan Larson created.  This high octane, musically innovative and striking show is also a beautiful and heartfelt exploration of youth, both lost and reclaimed; a very poignant portrait of the search for love and compassion, of hope and beauty in a world that everyday recedes deeper into the empty comforts of materialism and social acceptability.  An updated version of Puccini's masterpiece La Boheme, Rent is obviously not as shy about not only examining the wounds of its characters but of exhibiting them; its blatant honesty and unapologetic credo of life are a million miles away from the subtle, innocent and elegant sentiments of late 19th century Parisian artists, starving in their garrets while courting muses.  Rent is the ""black sheep"" of the Boheme lineage.  It's a piece of theatre that bristles with tenacity in the face of hardship and rejection:  No one here is willing to take anything lying down.  It's really little wonder it was as critically acclaimed as it was and won the many prestigious awards that it did and reason for that is that it manages to be what few musicals have ever managed to be:  Authentic, relevant but, ultimately, profoundly human; a rebellious celebration of life even in the face of addiction, illness and death .  Add to that mixture some really first rate music, stellar performances and stage direction (an ingenious arc that fluidly shifts its characters around Manhattan yet all within the confines of a stage that's, for the most part, barren) and you've got one heck of a winning recipe.  Rent is the musical for people who think they don't like musicals.  It's as far removed from traditional American musical theatre as it possibly can be.  It is the heir apparent to the socially relevant, politically conscience and in your face musical experience that was ushered in 40 years ago by the groundbreaking rock musical ""Hair.""  But, of course, the most tragic element about Rent was the premature death of its creator, Jonathan Larson, who, sadly and ironically, died the day before opening night, a few days shy of his 36th birthday.  But what a legacy he left us all.",1229644800,69,2392,4.8765432098765435
3685671,5,B001LMAKAQ,"As someone who was disappointed in the motion picture version of Rent, I was thrilled to find out they were filming the live stage show.  This experience has everything the film should have - including all the songs.  There is nothing like seeing a musical live in the theater but this experience did its best to recreate that, and where the motion picture fell flat and at times seemed muted (in tone not sound), this experience brought the music to life.  I look forward to owning a copy.",1229385600,7,490,4.545454545454546
3685672,4,B001LMAKAQ,Saw this in the theater after seeing the show multiple times on Broadway. Absolutely phenomenal.  I saw nuances in the characters that I missed on stage.  I love this play and I can't wait for this filmed version!,1228089600,8,213,4.578947368421052
3685673,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Back in September, fans of the musical ""Rent"" were sad because the musical was closing it's doors after 12 years of them being open. Now, the doors are opening back up in your living room. ""Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway"" is a filmed performance of the musical ""Rent"" in it's final days. It was shot in HD, so it will look lovely on Blu-ray Disc. The movie includes Tracie Thoms, who played Joanne in the movie adaption of ""Rent"", as Joanne, and a special appearance by the Original Broadway Cast. Special Features on the Disc include many featurettes about the last days of ""Rent,"" and about it's writer, Jonathan Larson, who unfortunately died before he could see the show on or off-broadway. The show is great, and the movie is well shot. I would recommend this title!!",1227571200,3,771,4.635036496350365

3685691,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Everyone who is complaining about this not being like the movie is correct, the move is an adaptation of the musical and this DVD is the original screenplay, not s crappy movie adaptation. Yes it can be chaotic on stage because that's how this show is. I LOVE that it was filmed live and feel like it's the highest quality performance and really captures the essence of the show. No, it's not the same as the movie because the movie actually changed a lot from the original show. In my opinion, this is ten times better!",1494547200,,520,4.427083333333333

3685779,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Even 20 years after its Broadway debut, this powerful show still resonates with audiences around the world. I watch this video a couple times each year when I need a fix.  The camera work, the lighting, and the sound editing on this video are really excellent. Video recordings of live  stage performances typically do not transfer well to film. This does. The cast, with the exception of Will Chase, are not well known outside  of the New York stage community. That said, this production was cast very well.

3685855,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I just saw this dvd yesterday and it is just as powerful as the film. Here is what I said about the film and the same applies. What is also amazing about the live  show is that the production stands out on its' own with no star power. The actors are very powerful. I thought that Mimi in particular was outstanding. I love Rosario Dawson but this young lady had great timing and you could see she did her research.

There's no day but today to write how great this dvd is! Rent is perhaps one of my best films ever. I loved each and every aspect of it. My daughter and I watch this film every year. Rent captures the spirit of a people who is filled with love, compassion and commitment towards themselves and their beliefs. It shows how your life could suddenly change in a year.

I also found it amazing how the cast was able to express what it is like to be poor. How they were cold and hungry and still managed to do what they do. Starving artists, friends, lovers, family. This is a heart breaking, gripping and raw look into the lives of people who do what they can to make it in this world.

This was Jonathan Larson's gift to the world. What a great gift it was. Generations will now understand the effects of poverty, AIDS, caring and friendship because of him. He found that one song, that one last glory before he transcended. Make sure you get the live Broadway version too. Powerful, heart wrentching story telling.",1398643200,,1428,4.337078651685394

3685867,5,B001LMAKAQ,"This post is in response to a previous one star review...Just a side note, Mark does not have aids, and neither does Maureen or Johann. As far as everyone being junkies, well Rodger used to be a junkie but he quit and admittedly Mimi is a junkie at the beginning but she also quits. I don't think that someone who can quit heroin cold turkey is weak, I believe that takes incredible willpower. The music is not bad, in fact it is excellent. You may not like it but objectively speaking it is good. In fact its considered to be, by many EXPERTS the epitome of bohemian rock. Now to tackle real jobs. To start with, Johann is a lawyer. In my book that's a real job. Mimi is a dancer at a strip club. It isn't exactly a respectable job to most people but it is a real job nonetheless. Collin's is a professor at university, again pretty real in my mind. Rodger is a singer/songwriter which right now doesn't pay well but it has potential to stick with it, unless of course you believe that all of those multimillion dollar recording artists don't have real jobs either. Mark is a director/cameraman. Something that pays on commission just like a photographer. Ultimately, Mark does get a real job from Buzzline. Maureen is a performer and sure that may not be considered a real job she seems to do alright for herself. Angel is a street musician and again not a real job as you put it but she does bring in a sizable paycheck, $1000 at one point. But being a Drag Queen she is likely unable to get a good job because of discrimination. As far as cheesy performances, they are stylized. Its a musical, its choreographed. Those are all part of the bigger picture. But everyone is entitled to their opinion. I just hope that someone doesn't read that review and not watch this because RENT is amazing. This version is so much better than the movie, it captures his vision so much better. Do yourself a favor and watch this recording.

It's not the original cast. (Though most of the original cast appears at the very end to sing with the final Broadway cast.)

Only down side: (which don't cost a star because this Blu-ray is basically perfect and well done, my personal whining is with the show itself):
I wish there were a version available with the original Mimi. She had a distinct voice. Rosario Dawson did a good job in the movie, and the Mimi in the final broadway show was good, but there is currently no way to view Rent at home with the Mimi from the original cast recording. In my ideal world, I'd have a version of this show exactly like this blu-ray (filmed live on broadway) but with the original-cast. Ah well, guess that's part of what makes a live stage show special.

(Note that the theatrical movie from 2005 DOES have the original cast, with the exception of Mimi and Joanne.)",1373414400,,1064,4.560209424083769

3685878,3,B001LMAKAQ,"When Rent came out as a feature length film (2005), I was excited to see how it would be done.  I was not a fan of the end result.  I loved the fact that it had most of the original cast, but it just wasn't the same.  When it was announced that a version that was filmed live was coming, I thought that it had a lot of promise.  It still isn't the same as being in the theater, but that isn't an option anymore.  It isn't the original cast, but that wasn't an option. This version does a good job of capturing the essence of Rent and has good video and audio quality.  It is difficult to show everything that is happening on stage.  There are a lot of cuts back and forth in an attempt at showing everything that occurs in the background and foreground.  I think it helps if you have seen the play in person.  People that have only seen this video and not the play have said that there is a lot going on and it is difficult to follow.  I would agree, but seeing it live isn't going to happen anymore.  They go as far as leaving in the entire intermission so that you feel as if you are really there.  You can never capture the magic of being at a live show, but this is about as close as you can get.",1372636800,,1200,3.9748953974895396

Mimi's voice is too thin and polished, somehow missing the deep and strong emotion. In my opinion Daphne Rubin-Vega did a much better job.

Also Joanne's sounds too girlish, not that funny and natural comparing to Fredi Walker.

3685923,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I bought this after having already seen someone else's copy.  This is an amazing, moving performance by very talented people.  I rarely cry, but found myself doing so at multiple points during the show, especially at the end of ""Contact"" and at the finale.

The guy who plays Mark brings so much of the young vibrancy the role of narrator needs.  The pathos he displays in his soliloquy ""Halloween"" when he worries that he'll be alone is also very good.

Roger is strongly moody, always ready for a fight, which I think blends well with his lyrics.  Say what you will about other guys who've played Roger, an insipid softly loving guy is just not what the character is about.  He's a rockin' dude looking death in the face, and he's upset and angry about it.  His version of ""One Song Glory"" is the best I've heard, even better than the original.

Mimi is energetic, yet can also be quiet.  Her ""Without You"" brings me to tears every time.  She's also willing to fight, which makes for interesting chemistry between her and Roger.

Angel does a lovely falsetto, and his part in ""Contact"" shows off his strong regular singing voice as well.  He does a very good job of keeping the character loving and tender, yet fun.  How he manages to look so very sick in ""Without You"" is beyond me, but he does a great job of it.

Collins is so full of passion when he performs the ""I'll Cover You"" reprise.  The rest of his performance is fairly ordinary.  He's got a good voice, but he's not as loud and flashy as the other characters.  This fits in with his persona as philosopher, but makes him fade a bit into the background.  Even his part in ""La Vie Boheme"" is quieter than everyone else.

Joanne does a great job.  The character is a strong, successful type, and she does it well.  Maureen also does well, although her character is my least favorite.  (The role itself irritates me, not the performer.)  Their duet, ""Take Me or Leave Me"" shows off the skills of both at belting out songs.  Benny is just as smarmy as the character should be.

The reprise at the end with the original Broadway cast adding to the final Broadway cast was just lovely, and you could see how they all felt about it ending.  The extra ""Last Days on Broadway"" feature of the DVD was an interesting look at the behind-the-scenes of the filming, as well as the feelings of the cast and crew.

In short, I'm very happy I bought this, and heaven forbid something happens to the DVD, I'd buy it again.",1327536000,2,2468,4.436525612472161

After all the hype and build up (I watched the specials first), it was annoying to see the audience reaction almost completely edited out of the performance - surely the point of a live performance.

The show itself is very good - , with extra scenes which help make sense of much of the film version, but it makes it much longer than the film version. It's dynamic, colourful, confronting, and beautiful, and although the sound is not as good as the film version, it's still pretty good.

The comradere forms between the diverse group of friends, brought together by each fragile thread, weaved by the writers dearly beloved mind, and hand.

Artist, musican, Drag queen star, and inspiration to the rest before her tragic, & sad death. Camera lover Mark, Tom Colins, Angel's life partner, Rodger suffering a failed existance, but wishes to write one perfect song before he- Mimi the exotic doe eyed dancer Junkie, and Maurine the delightfully, free loving, local exhibitionist & artist who wants to protest to the moon above, she has to only be what she is, and accept me for what I am! To her girl friend. There is this dude Benny, & he's got all the cards, playing against his buds, then also coming through.

Jonathan Larson, the poor play write who created, and gave people with Aids Hiv, and any horrors they & they're families & friends have to face every day hope to survive through, living every precious day like it's the first and last. Jonathan himself did just that, he died of the still not well known illness Marfan diease and had no idea he had it, though certainly showed signs of it. If your interested, you can look up Marfan on the web, & they would appreciate donations to the cause if you can.

After seeing this performance, my perspective on the show changed entirely. The performances are inspired, and the quality of the recording is remarkable. I was particularly impressed with the taping itself. The editors utilize cameras scattered all throughout the theatre--including cranes, handhelds, and some onstage cameras. Brilliant direction and editing from the film crew ensure that you never miss a beat. Now that the show has closed, this DVD is as close to a front row seat to RENT as you will ever get.

It was everything that I loved about the Broadway performance and more.  My one problem with this performance was the actress that played Mimi (I know--i must have a thing).

I was hoping it would basically just be good in quality and that there would be some good close-ups.  I got more than I wished for!!  Not only is the quality EXCELLENT, but there is a featurette which basically documents the last week of the show on Broadway and has interviews with the cast.  It was very moving; I could feel myself starting to tear up when they talked about Jonathan Larson.  I loved that some members of the original cast came out at the end and performed ""Seasons of Love"" with the rest of the cast.  I felt like I was there!

If you're a Rent fan, this is definitely something that you would love.  Even my mom, who said she only liked the movie (she had never seen the stage version) LOVED this performance.

Unfortunately, I have always missed the traveling company...it seems to come to my city shortly after I move elsewhere!  I was so excited when the film version came out, but it was less than satisfying for me.  There were certain parts that I missed and felt needed to be in the film (Roger and Mark arguing before he leaves for Santa Fe; Mimi telling Roger goodbye...how do you leave that out??!!).  I was a little nervous about buying a film of a live stage production because that could easily be poorly done, but I decided that I just had to see it on stage, whether I could be there live or not.  It was worth it!
I think the best part about this stage film was that I was able to see Rent as Jonathan Larson intended it--as a stage production.  There is something about the stage that makes it better, more pure than it can be on film.  I wish I had been able to see it on Broadway, but it didn't work out.  In my opinion, this is a great substitute and I will never regret this purchase.  No day but today!",1254528000,,1119,4.167441860465116
3685953,5,B001LMAKAQ,"RENT is one of my favorite Broadway shows. I saw it in December of 2007 in New York and loved it so much that I wanted to see it over and over again, and now I can!  I was sad when I heard that RENT was going off Broadway, but thrilled when I learned about this. You are essentially watching a movie, but you are getting the Broadway experience right in your own home, the best seats in the house!
Many people would say that it is not as great as the movie or that the singers are not up to par with the original cast, but for anyone who has seen the show on Broadway knows that the movie, while stays true to the show, leaves some funny and emotional parts out, like the songs ""Contact"" and the second part, the best part in my opinion, of ""Goodbye Love"" and quite a few more. I personal like the Broadway version better, if you prefer the movie, this DVD is not for you.  And just as a side note to people who think that the cast was terrible all I have to say is that it is obvious that they work hard and are talented or else they wouldn't be a part of the show and if you think you can do better then you go try out. That is the only negative thing I have to say in this review, because this DVD is perfect.  I no longer have to watch bad quality bootlegs just to ""get my sickness on""
The DVD offers a High Definition showing of the final performance, which as a RENT lover, makes me choke up just a little. Anyone who loves the Broadway show should get this DVD, it is a part of our culture and we should be able to share it with people who were not fortunate enough to see it when it was on stage.

Again the music is horrible, the performances are so cheesy I felt embarrassed to be in the same room with the movie playing but I had to watch it with a friend, all the way through.

3685958,4,B001LMAKAQ,"I have had the privilege of seeing rent multiple times as well as auditioning for rent a few times too. I love this musical!!! The movie was a virtual disaster in the hands of Christopher Columbus. He is a talented director and fan of the show but he is not a director of movie musicals and Rent, like Godspell and Jesus Christ Superstar are true stage musicals that don't make an easy transition to the screen.

That said, let's talk about this one. I'm gonna give you my quick comments and my wish list for what I wish had happened.

Let me preface this quick review by stating that I ""own it"" on bluray. Ok, I'm not going to tell you the story of rent. There are plenty of people here that can do that and do a better job of it than me. This was Jonathan Larson's Magnum Opus! It is so unfortunate that he had a heart condition that was misdiagnosed. We lost him way too soon.

Ok, now about the video. The stage, actors, colors and songs are glorious. Everyone is in fine form and I am thrilled that this ""one ticket event"" which was originally broadcast over a select period of days across the U.S. did find a home on dvd.

Now for my wish list. To film a stage musical is a very difficult task. It requires a director that understands staging from A to Z. If you want to see an ""extraordinary"" example of what can be done with a stage musical on film then check out the stage version of Oklahoma with Hugh Jackman. The director who shot Oklahoma have anywhere from ten to sixteen cameras on and around the stage. He wanted his audience to truly feel like they were sitting in the show and he left nothing to chance. This was the brilliance of Trevor Nunn. He had originally staged the musical for the London stage and knew exactly what kind of experience he wanted to create.

This is not the case with Rent. In the hands of Trevor Nunn this would have been an ""extraordinary"" film document of Rent. Unfortunately, it will have to settle for very good. That's not a bad thing but it could have been better. As it stands it will always be the musical for ""this generation"". This musical will stand the test of time and people will still be talking about the brilliance that was recognized ""too late"" in 200 years when they speak about Mr. Larson.

So, get this movie. Enjoy it. It is very good. However, the camera moves around on the stage and follows the actors but you're not seeing the play from an audience perspective for a good portion of the time you're only seeing parts of the stage. I suspect only two or three cameras were used. If more had been used, as in Oklahoma, you would be seeing the entire, glorious stage at all times. As it is there are times when people are singing and you know there are others on stage but you can't see them. This is part of the enjoyment of the theatre goer. We get to, for a short time, experience a small world through the staging and the actors but we don't really get to enjoy this production like we could if...

Enough said. No more criticism. This is a very good film version and worthy of a place in your movie collection. It is superior to the Chris Columbus movie because it captures the magic that didn't translate on to the big screen in the movie version.",1252454400,2,3218,4.3090909090909095

I have seen many shows on Broadway, but this show by far outshines them all. I just wish that I had seen this show with the original actors when it was first premiered in the late 90's. When the movie came out I was very excited because it gave me the chance to see the original actors in their element. The downside is although the movie was great, it does take away from the stage version. After seeing the show with the latest actors, I was very impressed. The music for this production is amazing. Jonathan knew what he was doing when he wrote this and it is really sad that he didn't get the chance to see the outstanding feedback Rent has recieved. Will Chase and Shaun Earl play the parts of Roger and Mark with great honesty and although they could never replace Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, the efforts they gave were 100% AMAZING!!

It can't duplicate the theater atmosphere, of course, but in some ways it's better -- you see more closeups, the lyrics are easier to understand, you can pause it whenever you want, etc. I saw the stage musical and the movie that came out a couple of years ago, but I'd say this is the best experience of all.

Even if you saw Rent on stage and didn't care for it much, you might want to at least see this version. The closeups and the quality of the sound will give you a much more intimate feeling than sitting 30 or 40 rows away. If you saw the other movie, which was certainly fine, you owe it to yourself to see the show as it was meant to be performed.",1248912000,,713,4.056737588652482

But little did I know that I would be transformed by the end of the DVD. I can sincerely say that this is why theatre exists! The bond between cast mates is unlike anything else in the world. Being in the audience of a great show offers the understanding of what true magic really is. ...A movie is nothing compared to the stage production of any show. But this theatre performance in film completely blew...me...AWAY....

I was watching this with two friends and we found ourselves bursting in thunderous laughing. Only to be halted by a gut gripping cry, shared by us all. The further the show goes on, the further you are seduced by this cast and their stories. I can honestly say that I recommend this Broadway performance of Rent on DVD to every single person. I have been housebound for almost two years now due to a crippling case of chronic fatigue syndrome. For the first time in so so very long, I felt like I was able to leave the house again and relive the most beautiful stage production that I have ever seen...

I found the close-ups and the camera work on this DVD to be stunning.  Enough long shots to remind you you are watching a stage production, but enough close-ups to really add to the total emotion of this musical.

One of the things that was kind of bitter-sweet for me was the filmed close-ups.  While the close-ups were perfectly timed, I felt that it took away from the general choreography and viewers will miss a few subtleties that happen in the background.  It just felt like something was missing...almost like watching a movie in full-screen mode.  You know something is going on, but it's cutoff.

What would have been great is if they allowed users to choose alternate angles...which they could have easily incorporated, but just didn't.

Anyways, still a great production...  If you haven't seen it, I don't think you'll get the same appreciation from just watching the dvd.  Again, a great companion to seeing it live, but definitely no replacement.",1242864000,3,914,4.9605263157894735
3685974,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Rent is one of only a handful of successful rock musicals, and it's a surprisingly good one.  Unfortunately the movie loses so much of the ""rock"" aspect of the live show, and the omission of songs and in many ways ""dumbing down"" of the original material definitely did not help the movie's cause.  For a while I was disheartened by the belief that the film version would be the only immortal version--until I saw this one, filmed live on Broadway.

The cast is definitely a VERY good cast, and it happens to be a cast I saw live and enjoyed immensely.  The recording quality is great from both the visual and sound aspects.  After only a few minutes this version seems to cause people to forget they're watching a small stage as they get drawn into the music, the singing, the acting, and the characters.

For people who were unfortunate enough to miss the live musical, and especially to the people whose entire idea of Rent is based on the movie, this is definitely not a DVD you'd want to miss.",1242259200,,997,4.480662983425415

The cast, for the most part, is spectacular. I have a little bit of an issue with the actress playing Mimi - she wasn't horrible, she just seemed a bit too dramatic/overacting.

3685985,5,B001LMAKAQ,"This movie does a fine job capturing the spirit and energy of the Broadway production of Rent.  [It also exposes the shortcomings of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rent-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000E1YVZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, the Hollywood's 2005 adaptation, but that's beside the point.]  One thing you lose in the translation to the screen is the primacy of the music - in person, it is a loud, rocking musical.  The band stands equal to the actors.  Here, the band is slightly pushed to the background.  I suspect this is a conscious decision in the mixing room so that the storyline is clearly audible.

What the title of the film doesn't make entirely clear is what makes it special:  this is the show's final Broadway performance.  As a result the emotion is sky high...and there are surprises galore in the curtain call and DVD extras.

The actors here are going to be held accountable to the performances of the original Broadway cast.  Those voices are immortalized forever on the sterling soundtrack.  Adam Pascal. Idina Menzel. Daphne Rubin-Vega.  Anthony Rapp. Jesse L. Martin.  Taye Diggs.  These are legends now.  How do you compare to that?  In most cases - with one notable exception - pretty well.  Eden Espinosa stands out as Maureen, as does young rookie Adam Kantor, perfectly cast as Mark Cohen.  The one big dropoff for me was Will Chase as Roger, the role perfected by Adam Pascal.  Pascal was a rocker before he was an actor.  He brought a vocal primacy to the role that is lacking from Chase's vocals.  Plus, Chase is 38, same age as Pascal is today.  The show debuted 12 years ago.  Roger is supposed to be Mark's contemporary.  Here, he's 17 years older than Mark.  It shows.

I give this five stars because of the extras.  For Rent-heads, there's some spectacular backstage material here, including an unexpectedly moving look at the ""Last Lottery"" (where they dole out seats in the first two rows for $20 apiece - a brilliant buzz creator).  Where it gets you is the impact the show's closing has on the guys running the lottery. It's clear these two gentleman loved their jobs and conducted the lottery with unbridled passion.",1239580800,,2268,5.156593406593407

3685988,2,B001LMAKAQ,"This film of the final Broadway performance of RENT is a fairly decent record of what made the show beloved by some and excoriated by others.  Though hailed as avant-garde at the time, hindsight reveals it to be a fairly traditional musical in structure and design and, truth be told, more cliche-ridden than anyone acknowledged.  All of that is evident in this film.  Jonathan Larson had a knack for writing delicious melodies, but he never met a lyrical cliche he didn't like. Nowhere is this more evident than in the ""La Vie Boheme"" section where the rather fresh-scrubbed ""bohemians"" carry on at length about ""anything taboo"" and something-or-other about revolution.  Anachronistic in 1996, it plays even worse now.  After a while, one starts to wonder what on earth all of these self-centered, ""faux"" bo-hos are carrying on about.  The other component that reeks of cliche is the insipid banality of the central lovebirds.  Typical ""ingenue / leading man"" material direct from central casting, the Mimi / Roger axis is easily the least interesting aspect of RENT and it stops the show dead in its tracks every time they take center stage.  It's ""boy meets girl...boy almost loses girl...boy gets girl in the end"".  That's not avant-garde...that's Andy Hardy.

The staging of RENT has often been derided for bringing the actors to the lip of the proscenium to bellow their songs into the audience's face.  This is duly recorded here, and all that show-biz razzmatazz is at odds with the so-called bohemian world of the protagonists.  It does accomplish one very important task, however.  All of the razzle-dazzle disguises the fact that these folks are a self-absorbed bunch with little substance and lots of whining self-pity.  In other words, just what you'd expect from a roomful of actors.

Still, there are those marvelous songs and Larson's ability is never more obvious than in the terrific set-piece ""Take Me or Leave Me"", which is a great showstopper.  ""Seasons of Love"" may be as much of a cliche now as the image of all of those miked actors, headsets at the ready, but that's because of the pedestrian staging.  The song is lovely and the actors in this performance are clearly relishing its message.  ""Will I Lose My Dignity..."" is a simple roundelay that is beautifully hymn-like, and the anthemic ""What You Own"" is a stirring eleven-o'clocker.  The actors in this performance are, by and large, both passionate and exuberant (""Roger"" and ""Mark"" excluded) and they serve the material well, and it helps that no one is famous because rather than star turns we get performances.  Edin Espinoza as the quixotic Maureen is the best sung rendition of this tricky part, and she brings an infectious urgency to everything she does.  The chemistry she and Tracie Thoms share creates a cohesion sometimes lacking elsewhere in this film, though Justin Johnson and Michael McElroy also stand out in the spotlight.  The most interesting aspect of the DVD, and the only reason to own it, is the inclusion of several short features documenting the final days of the RENT phenomenon.  Take it or leave it, RENT spent more than twelve years on Broadway and stirred a generation of actor-singers.  It's a seminal work which may not have aged well and is unlikely to speak to future generations, but it remains a time capsule that effectively captured a moment.  I guess you had to be there.",1239062400,10,3391,4.9070175438596495

3685990,5,B001LMAKAQ,"There were a couple of instances in this film where I wished they would have zoomed out a bit for a wider shot...but that's small potatoes.

This was great.  There's a special place in my heart for the original cast (they join in for the final Seasons Of Love), but I thought this cast pulled it off well.  Justin Johnston did a great job as Angel (probably my second favorite next to WJH's), and I love the part during I'll Cover You where he says, ""My Wig! Hold on!""

I'm also glad to see Tracie Thoms finally make it to the stage production.

Overall, this video was wonderful.  A must have if you've never seen RENT live, and a great keepsake if you have!  More Broadway shows should do this for the people who can't afford to pay $100/ticket and/or live in an area that just doesn't have the venue for live shows.",1238371200,3,818,4.30718954248366
3685991,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Well, it had to happen eventually.  After 12 years on Broadway, ""Rent"" has finally closed its doors.  As far as musicals go, it is certainly one of the best documented, with numerous books, news articles, and websites devoted to its creation.

There are many theories about why the show became and remains so popular, but my two cents is that it was simply the right story told in the right way at the right time.  In the mid-nineties, an entire generation of theatre fans was looking for a musical that spoke to them, about issues unique to their generation (in the same way ""Hair"" embodies the hippie counter-culture for children of the 60s).  And along came Jonathan Larson, who cleverly recast Puccini's timeless opera ""La Boheme"" as a rock-musical about artists, rockers, gays, and lesbians struggling with issues like drugs and AIDS in New York City.  It was a story that spoke to people, particularly young people, yet dealt with such universal issues like love and acceptance that fans of any age could relate.

It even managed to get a film adaptation in 2005, but many fans (myself included) felt that despite the inclusion of most of the original cast, Hollywood did not do justice to the stage version.  For all of those fans, and those who have yet to experience ""Rent,"" this DVD is the answer.  This is the show we all fell in love with, performed to near perfection by an energetic young cast and filmed live during its final days on Broadway.

Like any good Rent-head, I have seen the show multiple times, and this is honestly the best cast I have ever seen.  They convey the energy and emotion so vital to the show's success, making it feel fresh and new again.  You'd never know the show had been running for 12 straight years, because this cast attacks the material with such sincerity and heart.  Not only do they sound incredible, but this cast is also the strongest group of actors I have seen in these roles.  My biggest complaint about ""Rent"" is that I never felt it was acted to its full potential.  Until now.  I know the show backwards and forwards, and yet they brought out all kinds of nuances and connections I had previously missed.  The cast's commitment and honesty make songs like ""La Vie Boheme"" and the title tune truly celebratory, and ""Without You"" and ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"" all the more heartwrenching.  And watching Angel run onstage to join the final tableau will always make me misty-eyed (and I rarely get that emotional).

Standouts include: Will Chase as Roger, giving a near difinitive interpretation of the role (sorry, Adam Pascal fans); Renee Goldsberry as his love interest, the drug-addicted Mimi; Eden Espinosa as defiant protest artist Maureen; and Tracie Thoms, reprising her role of Joanne from the 2005 film and proving she definitely has the vocal and acting chops to perform this show 8 times a week.

Any fan of ""Rent"" needs this DVD.  It preserves the show in its entirity (no cutting ""Christmas Bells"" for time!), with the staging and inherent theatricality that really makes the show sing.  It is *almost* as good as seeing the show live.  Now you can relive this show, a true landmark in musical theatre history, whenever you want.  Which is easily worth $20 they're asking for this disc.",1238284800,2,3256,4.7322695035460995
3685992,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Although there is nothing that can replace the Broadway experience, this is as close as we can get now.

Rent is great production which came across great on Blu-ray.  The extras on the disk were an added bonus.",1238284800,,210,4.5
3685993,4,B001LMAKAQ,"My wife is a bigger fan of musicals than I am. I enjoy them now and again, though. So while I went into this Blu-Ray thinking ""well, this is one for the wife,"" I came away having definitely enjoyed the show on both technical and artistic levels.

First, the program itself:

""Rent"" is a wildly successful musical for a good reason. It has very enjoyable songs, a plot which is easy to relate to, and a certain ""cool factor"" which is undeniable. The extra features on the disc also go into some of the other aspects which made it such a success - its unique venue in NY, the tight knit cast and crew, etc.

I will say, being a complete ""Rent"" neophyte, I came away with ambiguous feelings about the message of the show. I mean, sure, appreciating your family (whether adopted or otherwise) and enjoying the present moment without wallowing in regrets are probably pretty good things. But what about making good, solid choices in terms of your lifestyle in the first place? Given the drug use and promiscuous sex (gay or straight, whatever your pleasure is fine by me) portrayed, is it any mystery why many of the characters suffer from AIDS and drug addictions? It may be telling that the characters who make what are likely the most ""conservative"" choices (the filmmaker, the landlord) are the ones who are portrayed least favorably.

In the end, I might be worried about the messages this sends to young viewers, and I'd probably wait until a child was 12 or 13 before exposing them to this. A kid would need the ability to critically analyze characters and compare them to his or her life before I would let them watch something which seems at times to glorify lifestyle choices that put their adherents in danger of disease, homelessness, addiction, etc. Compare a show like ""Chicago"" - although it follows characters who perform many dastardly deeds in seeking fame, such behavior always earns its comeuppance in the end, and there is a very dark satirical edge to it. This complexity seems missing, here.

Anyway, for an adult audience, this is certainly a good show with many memorable character moments, scenes, dances, and songs. It's quite dazzling and contains very high-quality singing. It definitely ranks up there as one of the better Broadway shows I've seen.

The Blu-Ray:

WOW! This is in the top tier of Blu-Ray discs I've viewed. Detail is crisp and consistent without being over-processed, colors really pop (owing in part to the dark backdrops), and the sound is immersive. This presentation is reminiscent of very good HD concert footage you might find on Over-The-Air HDTV or on premium cable channels like HDNET - but even better still, since Blu-Ray allows for less compression of the source material.

You should definitely make sure your TV or projector are well-calibrated - this is a disc with a LOT of black on the screen at any given time. If your brightness levels and gamma are not set well, a digital display can easily crush a lot of the detail in dark parts of the screen. I would recommend, short of buying a calibration disc such as ""Digital Video Essentials,"" that you at least pop in a Lucasfilm DVD (e.g. Star Wars, Indiana Jones) to use the ""THX Optimizer."" This way, you can ensure that you will see all of the dazzling detail that this disc has to offer.

Supplements are very nice and give a good feel for the background of the show. The supplements are in HD as well, which is a nice bonus compared to many companies' tacked-on DVD leftovers.

I do have questions about the idea of filming a Broadway show - while sometimes a closeup on a face can give a good aspect to the performance, other times, closeups really detract from a contextual viewing of the entire stage, which would be the viewer's experience live. On the whole, I guess it weighs out in favor of the good - live, you might be stuck behind someone's head or have a bad angle for certain parts of the stage.

In summary, this is a total no-brainer for any fan of the show who has a good HD setup at home. The detail and immersion are absolutely top-notch.

For someone who is a bit milder a musical fan (like me) there is a lot to like in this disc, in terms of technical excellence as well as artistic merit. So, where my wife might give it 5 stars, I would give it 4. A good, solid Blu-Ray to own.",1238025600,4,4310,4.568652849740933
3685994,5,B001LMAKAQ,"When I first read last year that RENT was closing on Broadway, I had to read those words several times over to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. Over the last twelve years, the show has been a profound part of the lives of many people. This may seem strange, but, well, RENT is hardly an ordinary musical.

RENT, a modern update of Puccini's La Boheme, is the story of a group of friends living in the East Village of New York City in the mid-'90s. Over the course of two and a half hours, the audience gets a glimpse of this Bohemian lifestyle, an incredibly honest glimpse that is as far as can be from the Rodgers and Hammerstein type of Broadway storytelling. The cast struggles with the meanings of love, friendship, and life, as well as the pains of poverty, loss, addiction, and HIV/AIDS. It is an incredibly engaging story which takes the audience on a roller-coaster of emotions from the first number to the final curtain.

Because the show has affected so many over its twelve year run, those involved have graciously allowed the production of this filmed version to serve as a monument to the late Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer-winning masterpiece, as well as giving those who never got the opportunity to see the show on Broadway a chance to have that experience in some fashion. In the interest of self-disclosure, when I heard that this disc was going to be released, I was a bit skeptical. As is mentioned in the included special features, part of the magic of seeing a show on Broadway is being in that moment and atmosphere. I was unsure how that magic would translate from being in the theatre to watching the performance on a television screen.

I am happy to report, however, that my skepticism was unfounded. Though not as good as seeing RENT live, RENT: Filmed Live on Broadway is the next best thing (yes, even better than the 2005 theatrical version). The performance in this release is the result of a mix of footage from the last Broadway performance on September 7, 2008 and scenes filmed outside the environment of a ticketed performance. The editing is done really well and it is difficult to tell which scenes were filmed live or not, though there are some obvious points.

As with any Broadway show, the cast can make or break any given performance. This cast is one of the best that I have personally seen. Most are RENT veterans and are thus intimately familiar with the characters they play and the relationship dynamics. Standouts include Adam Kantor's portrayal of Mark Cohen and Justin Johnston's Angel (Johnston has continued this role in the Rent farewell tour currently touring the country).

The Blu-ray version contains a number of special features covering different aspects of the show's last week on Broadway. These include featurettes on the note-covered outside walls of the Nederlander Theatre, the Nederlander itself, casting the show over its twelve year run, choosing the final Broadway cast, members of the original cast who came back to see the last performance, and a featurette on the final $20 ticket lottery. Also included are two PSAs, one for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, and the other for the National Marfan Foundation (Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that is the likely cause of the aortic aneurysm that ended Larson's life).

The film is presented in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1.  This film really shows off the capabilities of HD presentation.  The colors are rich and vibrant, the black levels are realistically deep, and there were no noticeable film artifacts.  Even small details, like the glitter shaken out of Mimi's hair during ""Out Tonight,"" were picked up by the cameras used to capture the performance.  The video quality is truly amazing.

The audio is also impressive, though not as impressive as the video.  Recorded in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, the audio is able to pick up subtle nuances in the performance both on stage and in the audience.  The music and speech come through the center and front channels, with the audience filling the two rear speakers in an attempt to recreate the performance hall feel.  The disappointments come in the band not coming through as raw and powerful as they would in a live performance, most of the time sounding far off and muted.  Despite this, the audio is still good enough to not take too much away from the overall presentation.

More than a Broadway show, RENT was an event, a happening that completely encapsulated the culture of Jonathan Larson and others struggling with life and loss in the Bohemian world of New York City. Though RENT has darkened its lights on Broadway, Larson's incredible genius has been preserved in this disc chronicling the last days of a show that has touched so many lives since its opening in 1996.",1237939200,,4774,4.803658536585366
3685995,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Having been the first ever show that I saw live on Broadway, RENT holds a special place in my heart. I fell in love w/ the music first, then bought the movie and enjoyed it, and then saw it on stage and realized how much more emotional the performances are on stage. This version of RENT delivers that raw powerful emotional performance in the same way seeing it live did. The camera angles are great for showing you all that is going on and not leaving you wondering what you've missed out on. I literally cried throughout the last half of this particular version...something that I do not do w/ the film version.

If you're a RENT enthusiast and don't yet have this version, ORDER IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You won't be sorry!!!",1237939200,,725,4.534351145038168
3685996,2,B001LMAKAQ,"Every time I see this show, it is just a cloned version of the original cast. I liked the original cast, but once you change casts the actors should be able to make the part their own. This seems like a bunch of Rentards who spent their high school years working for this part, practicing it the same way they heard it on CD or saw it on the stage. Theatre is supposed to grow and change. This doesn't further the idea that Rent was when it first came out... so sad it closed last year.
Sorry to offend any Rent fans, but that's how I feel.",1237766400,3,540,4.05607476635514

3685998,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I have watched the show so many times and in multiple places.  I have to say that I loved it when I finally got to watch RENT @ the Nederlander.  I have been fan since I first watch Neil Patrick Harris walk out on stage in La Jolla.  I am happy to have this so that I can watch the show and relive the show whenever I feel like it.  Though nothing beats actually seeing the show live and it never fails to reignite my passion for it, especially seeing both Ant and Adam doing the show.  No Day But Today!!",1237420800,,505,3.9603960396039604
3685999,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I was introduced to the world of RENT in 2005 with the release of the film adaptation, and I'm glad to say I've come a long way since. I loved the film, but then I got to see the actual show in Cleveland in 2006 and fell even more in love with the whole thing. There's a certain raw edge, a certain emotional level to the stage show that I felt was missing in the film. So as you can imagine I was beyond excited when I heard they were filming the last night on Broadway. I missed the opportunity to see the final tour when it came through Cleveland, so I definitely made it a priority to buy this dvd.
Well, it came in the mail yesterday and since then I think I've watched it three times. Yeah. Maybe I just miss the stage show that much, or maybe it's just that good of a show. Or maybe both; I don't know.
So, a rundown of favorites, because that's what I love to talk about:
My favorite character here is definitely Mark. Adam Kantor is incredible, especially considering he was still a student at Northwestern University when this was filmed. Makes me jealous. But he's so adorable and he completely gets the character. I think his portrayal is a bit more sarcastic (however subtly) than Anthony Rapp's, and like I say he made Mark my favorite character.
Roger (Will Chase) was another wonderfully portrayed role. Besides One Song Glory (which he delivers fantastically), the part that sticks out in my mind is the end of the Life Support meeting, when Roger turns and joins Gordon in singing ""Because reason says I should've died three years ago"". SO powerful. He also has excellent chemistry with Renee Elise Goldsberry (Mimi), a must... which brings me to her.
Renee makes an excellent Mimi -- what I adore most is her energy. She bounces all over the place and she's adorable. After I saw the film and before I saw the stage show, I couldn't fathom how a woman could pull off electric blue spandex and call it sexy at the same time -- I'd seen pictures of Daphne Rubin-Vega and others, and the look just didn't appeal to me in the slightest. But once you've seen it, and seen it done well, you understand. Goldsberry pulls it off just like anyone else who has ever played Mimi on stage, and does it beautifully. The one thing I criticize about her is that her voice seems a bit too opera-suited and not as ""raw"" as I would prefer -- too much vibrato in places where I would expect to hear just a straight note. But she has a beautiful voice and cannot be faulted for that.
Justin Johnston's Angel is probably my favorite out of the three I've seen (including original cast member Wilson Jermaine Heredia, in the film). He imbues Angel with a joy of life that makes him completely irresistible. To tell the truth, Angel had been one of my least favorite characters in the past, but as with Mark, I've fallen in love with Angel. My favorite bit from him is a little line just before ""I'll Cover You,"" when Collins asks if they're a ""thing"". Angel replies, ""Darling, we're everything."" I was sold. SO cute.
His counterpart, Michael McElroy's Collins, is performed very solidly. I wasn't overly impressed, but I liked him all the same. This is another pair that needs to have chemistry, and they definitely do. Their interactions in ""I'll Cover You"" and ""You Okay Honey?"" are excellent and really set the tone for their characters' love story.
Maureen, played by Eden Espinosa, is fantastic. She's enthusiastic, funny, and believable, and that's what I love about her. (For all the theatre geeks out there, I just want to say I think it's awesome that this is the second time she's picked up a role begun by Idina Menzel). =] I've seen clips of when she performed in Wicked, but I have to say I love her Maureen. She works really well with Traci's Joanne (again, chemistry -- love it) and her rendition of ""Over the Moon"" is hilarious.
Traci Thoms -- who is someone Rent enthusiasts should remember as Joanne in the film as well -- is I think much better in this on-stage setting. ""We're Okay"" gives her a chance to show off her solo stuff, and she just seems to fit the part better in the stage costume.
Rodney Hicks, an original cast member, plays Benny and was, I think, very successful. He made the character a bit more cheesy than Taye's original, very accustomed to his life as the husband of a ""wealthy daughter of the revolution.""
Personally, I really loved watching the people in the chorus. All of them were phenomenal in the multiple character personas that each played. I adored all of them and each, I think, is notable. Gwen Stewart is an original cast member and just as wonderful as she was on the cast album. Jay Wilkison was incredible as Gordon and ""The Man"", among others. Telly Leung was most adorable as the squeegee man and the waiter, and Marcus Paul James gave a flawless performance in all of his characters. My very favorite though was Tracy McDowell, who had played Maureen when I saw the tour in Cleveland. She was a joy to watch, never boring.
Overall, I have to say that I don't think any diehard RENThead should go without this in their collection. This show will be missed -- here's a chance to hang onto it.
No day but today.",1237420800,2,5165,4.478260869565218

Missed out on seeing this being filmed, as I got the email invite too late, but I was thrilled to see it on the big screen.  I loved it and felt it had certainly done justice to the magic of the play capturing the emotional beauty and the essence of the play.

The special features to this DVD are really exactly that.  Special! Emotional! Wonderful! I loved them and think they are a great addition to the DVD.  They take you behind the scenes of the final days and they make you feel like you were part of it all.  Bravo!",1236470400,,671,4.277777777777778

For those who are major Rent Heads this is perfect. Reliving every song and movement. And for those who have never seen the show but have always wanted to it's a great way to see it. Of course it's not exactly the same as watching it live in a theater full of people. But this is the next best thing.

3686013,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Live performances are always better than filmed versions. That is why movie musicals can never stand up to the originals on which they were based. However, this isn't the RENT movie again (thank goodness!). It is the whole live performance - the last performance, which is important for RENTheads everywhere - filmed from a variety of different angles. This performance was one of the best performances I've seen, and I saw the show 5 times. You do lose a little because you aren't watching it live. The first song, ""Rent,"" can hurt your eyes if you're watching it on a big screen because it switches and shifts around so much. Same with ""Christmas Bells."" There is too much going on in songs like those to get the big picture on film, but they were close. Overall, though, this DVD is pretty much the closest anyone's going to get to seeing RENT as it was on Broadway, considering it closed, unless you're lucky enough to have the tour pass close by. RENT was not just a musical - it was a rock opera, a brilliant adaptation of ""La Boheme,"" and it was an era.

I can't even begin to count the number of shows and legendary performances I've missed out on, or would love to relive, but the closest I ever get is when they make a movie version.  I always jump at the chance to watch a new movie musical, but it's never the same.  The singing is always over-processed, the lip-syncing causes a disconnect between the singing and the acting, and all of the energy of live theater is always missing.

When I heard that the final performance of Rent on Broadway was being released on Blu-Ray, I ordered it immediately.  Rent was the first musical I ever fell in love with, and the chance to see the Broadway performance was too much to pass up.  I LOVE THIS DVD!!  The cast was hand-picked in order to ensure the show closed with a bang, and indeed it did.  The talent is incredible!  The camerawork brings you right on to the stage with the actors and adds to the overall energy of the performance.  Finally, the extra features are a must for any fan of Rent.

To those of you who loved the musical but hated the movie, BUY THIS DVD!  It has everything that was lacking in the movie version.

To those of you who loved the movie and never saw Rent live, BUY THIS DVD and see why soo many people fell in love with this show in the first place!

And then a trip to NYC appeared on my work schedule.

I wasn't prepared for the intensity of the raw emotion and passion that filled the Nederlander. I think Angel's death is one of the most beautiful and moving moments I have ever seen on Broadway...when he gets up, slowly walks off the stage, the stark white sheet now his heavenly gown, and that last look he gives to his lover and friends...I still tear up. And of course there is the finale when he comes racing in and joins the cast...if you sat in the Nederlander Theatre and saw a 40-something man with tears on his cheeks, it could well have been me! I saw it on a Thursday evening performance and at intermission immediately went to the box office and bought my Saturday matinee ticket.

Thank you to everyone involved...blessings to Larson for his creation, and all respect to his sister and parents who have carried on the beautiful message of hope and acceptance that this musical represents.

What we who live not too near the Great White Way are ever-mindful of losing, what we fear we will forget, is that Broadway is worth the money.  There is no regional theater, traveling troupe, or any other pretender that even comes close to the juggernaut of talent and performance quality of a show in New York.  Some will poo-poo it (think twice), some will flat out deny it, and some will call me mental.  Betcha half of those have never been past Parsippany.

In a word, GREATNESS lives in the shadows of Times Square.  It performs eight shows a week because it loves and is loved.  Thanks to the makers for so well documenting the validity of our love affair.",1235779200,,770,4.418439716312057

The cameras are RIGHT THERE and though it gets frustrating to not be able to see the whole stage at times (especially when you're used to watching certain parts), it is kind of neat to be shown things you might normally not pay attention to.

The special features are super fun.... just the backstage interviews with the cast. I'm a big Eden Espinosa fan and there are many clips of her backstage (along with the rest of the cast!).

3686027,5,B001LMAKAQ,"""Rent: live on Broadway"" is a killer production.  Jonathan Larson has created an upscale La Boheme that resonates with passion and diversity.
Never having seen Rent live, I was impressed with the whole presentation.

The music was vivid and raw, while the themes that resonated were ones we see everyday.  The issues of homelessness, 'art' vs sell out, and real estate/business vs the little guy are vaild everywhere.  While the drug/sexual culuture pervades the storyline, the success of the characters as they live one year on talent and the grace of a benevolent landlord is obvious.

The special features are a good fit for the DVD, and turn this into a must own DVD for musical fans.

This comes highly recomended.",1235347200,6,719,4.900826446280992

What a wonderful thing it would be for future generations to have a record of exactly what it was like to sit in the theatre for a performance.  What a brave thing for the producers of this film as leaving the material alone is sometimes the hardest thing to do (for example the travesty that was the movie of RENT.)

All the performances are stronger and some perhaps the best I've seen.  Mark is played wonderfully by the perfect guy for the part.  Collins has a beautiful voice.  Mimi gives a very different performance than others I've seen and it is just as good.  The cast are wonderful actors as well and the whole thing is immensely satisfying.

The story was relevant, the characters allowed you to empathize, and the story is a humanistic, and relatable storyline, that captivates people of all walks of life, and situations. I absolutely LOVED the broadway show.

I had seen the other ""movie"" of Rent and was not impressed. This ""live taping"" is redemption for a Broadway legacy. Film, unlike a broadway live performance, adds the extra aspect, of being able to ""point"" your attention towards the scene or expression on an actors' face that you are meant to see. This live taping achieves a significant level of focus,in making sure that you do not miss key moments of the show and the interaction of the actors.

The picture and sound quality were phenomenal. The Blu-Ray presentation was perfect for this project, as the colors, music and detail pop on screen, for the viewer. It is a great ""beyond the front row"" opportunity, and after certain songs, I felt like I was ""there"" all over again.

The features were touching and well done, and provided the necessary perspective, to remind us, of the impact that the creator of Rent, had on generations of audience members, and on their personal stories.

An absolutely MUST for Rent Heads!",1234656000,,1326,4.752173913043478
3686043,5,B001LMAKAQ,"One of the most emotional and stirring Broadway experiences ever has been captured on film, and this is as good as it could possibly get.

It is said that nothing recreates the sheer visceral thrill of a Broadway show...or I should say, a GOOD Broadway show. That particular alchemy of of live performance, plot/story, music and an audience is essentially un-reproducible in any other media.

But MAN is this close!

I started by referring to ""Rent"" as a Broadway ""experience"" more than a show. That's because the show is better the more you know about it.

Beginning with the initial idea, the transposition of Puccini's ""La Boheme"", modernized to late 90's New York...is it too early to refer to that time period as ""turn of the century?""...it was a musical that was strikingly contemporary and exceedingly specific. Since it was masterfully done, it has also proved to be timeless and universal. They don't hand out Pulitzers for nothing.

Knowing that the show's creator, Jonathan Larson, died of an undiagnosed thoracic aortic aneurysm the night before opening night previews, adds immeasurable subtext to a show about, among other things, living each day as if it were the last.

Knowing the special relationship between the show, its' production crew, its' fans and the city of New York heightens the drama and intensity of the show itself, and here, the final performance.

In other words, the story of ""Rent"" is as enthralling as the show itself. The documentary on the DVD of the FILM version of ""Rent"" does a terrific job of telling THAT story.
And speaking about that film version...(which is never referred to during any of the several excellent behind-the-scenes segments here)...many die-hard Rent-heads have been quite vocal about their disdain for the film; critics were not that impressed either. Personally, I feel they did about as good a job as could have been done, without simply filming the show itself. Plus I got to see most of the original cast members, something I'd never otherwise get a chance to see.

Like I said, nothing reproduces that sense of urgency and drama like live theater.

THIS is that ""filmed show."" They literally filmed a Broadway performance. What seemed a bit dull in the movie bursts with color and vibrancy here.

They cheat a bit; sometimes the cameras are right over the shoulders or in the faces of the cast members. That clearly didn't happen closing night. This is seamlessly edited together with previous performances using cameras on stage in the midst of the action. It is so well done that the close-ups add to the intensity. Seeing a cast member with a tear rolling down their cheek...something you couldn't see past the fourth row...just nails certain points in the show with that ""real"" drama you don't get from ""film"". It pulls you close.

Hearing the roar of the crowd, either to applaud each performance or in some cases, to applaud in anticipation of an upcoming appearance (which is, I have to say, really cool to hear...) adds to the immediacy of your viewing experience. Seeing little imperfections, a little stumble, a vocal wobble, does the same thing. (For all I know, they were intentional...how the heck do I know...) The feeling of ""you are there"" has never been done as well as it has been done here.

The show has become so personal to so many people, with so many fans seeing the original cast, the various Broadway iterations, the touring companies, the film, and now this, that they'll have their own favorite Mimi or Roger or Angel. This particular cast, I have to say, is pretty fine, top to bottom. Hardcore Rent-heads will find little to quibble about, and newbies won't be missing a thing. Yes, you might miss having Mimi a bit less polished (I always envisioned her character as a little ""sloppy"" or rough; here she sings perfectly)...and in my ""Rent"" world, Angel is usually more diminutive...more petite.

Did this affect my watching this Blu-Ray? Not even remotely.

In fact, I felt the same way I did when I saw the show for the first time, here in L.A. Then, I was so unexpectedly overwhelmed by the show, I was moved, as they say, to tears. Not the little, single drop that spills over your right eyelid either. Big messy sobs. From a 40-year-old heterosexual male. In public. Way embarrassing.

Here, ""Rent"" got to me again. This time, knowing all that I know about the show, that sense of love and loss was just that much more profound. The tears came back, a bit more reserved this time, but continued throughout the compelling ""making-of"" segments.

Technically, the disc is awesome. Awe-invoking. Awe-inspiring. Whatever. Awe. With the pristine vocals from and center, music presented on a huge soundstage and the raucous crowd swirling in your surrounds...I'm telling you, I was right there.

Even the intermission...ten minutes long...is presented in its' entirety. Seriously. A camera sits stationary, maybe center front balcony, while a clock ticks down on screen. You see production crew moving things around, the tops of the heads of the people in the first rows milling about...it's kinda funny actually. At one point, a stage hand walks across the stage and waves to the camera.

The video reproduction is impeccable. Only in the scenes where the lighting is necessarily super-low do you get any sort of image degradation...it's trivial. Otherwise, this looks so real. It's HD at it's finest. Again, ""you are there."" Only better.

If you've read this far, there are a few things for you that I haven't written about, that you need to find out about on your own.
1) You will go nuts during the encore...they do another song, with some friends showing up.
2) You need to see each and every featurette. Stuff they show and talk about in the first ones comes back in the later ones. Things you think you know, you don't. You'll be moved beyond belief.
3) If you've seen a lot of ""Rent"" shows, you will see old cast members in the audience, during the various featurettes. Check them out for that reason alone.

This is not a rental...you need to own ""Rent."" Go. Click. Now.",1234051200,11,6075,4.834296724470135

3686045,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Rent is it's own phenomenon. Truly a unique show on Broadway, gritty, real, raw. For twelve years, it set the White Way on fire with its music, its stories of all types of love, it's handling of AIDS and drug abuse. It became more than just a musical, but an honoring of so many people's stories, of so many people's realities. With the news of the closing of the show, the powers that be smiled upon us, and took to filming one of the final performances of the show for austerity and all of us who have spent the last years loving this show.

Not to be confused with the movie version, which recaptured many of the original actors performances in the roles they founded, Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway captures the zest and energy of the actual show. After having watched the movie version now for a couple of years frequently, I'd forgotten how much of the original show songs that I really loved that had been eliminated from the movie. The performances of the final cast are real, although I must admit my heart longs for Anthony Rapp or Idina Menzel again.

Sometimes, the filming of a musical just doesn't work well. Odd cuts, weird camera angles, or jarring shots sometimes take you out of the show and become more distracting. Fortunately, this show has none of that. The camera work is invisible, and very real, allowing you to enjoy the show fully.

Complete with several ""makng of"" segments that only add to the enjoyment of the DVD, this is one disc that you must have for your collection if you are a fan of the show. We may not be able to attend the show anymore, but we'll have this to watch when we need a dose of humility, or just want to hear some of our favorite songs once again.

I've seen the show live 4 times.  I love having the DVD because there are so many nuances in the expressions and actors that you can't see from your seat in the theater.  Being able to see those make it that much better.
I'm also glad this was filmed with a live audience, especially during Marueen's show.  It just wouldn't be the same without the mooing.",1233878400,,523,4.295918367346939
3686048,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I was fortunate enought to see RENT on stage before seeing the movie.  This play touched me in such a profound and ineffable way.  When I heard that it was closing, I was in shock.  I had wanted nothing more than to play Maureen on Broadway.  But it was a comfort to me to be able to see it once more, and filmed on Broadway.
I took my best friend to see it, and he had only seen the movie version before.  He was amazed at how much had been cut out.  He enjoyed the play version much more.  And now I can watch my favorite play anytime, in the comfort of my home, like I'm really there.
If you haven't seen RENT or have only seen the movie version, then I strongly recommend this film.  Like any great artist, Jonathan Larson was able to deliver as touching message about serious human issues in an entertaing and moving manner.  I can never watch RENT without crying and coming away a better person.  I cannot put into word the effect this play had on my life.",1233792000,,962,4.151351351351352

3686061,5,B001LMAKAQ,"Having seen the show on Broadway 4 times, including twice 2nd row center stage, I was amazed at how well done this was.  They obviously really studied how best to record it.  They knew when to do close ups & when to do wide shots.  I saw things that I had never seen before.  It was breathtaking.  I saw it with a friend who had also seen it on Broadway, & we both agreed that it was even better than seeing it on Broadway because of all the closeups.  I cried like I did every time I saw it live.
The 4 times that I saw it were in the final 11 months of its run, so I knew almost all of the actors, except for those who had replaced some actors.  Seeing them on film was like seeing old friends.
This is a must have for every Rent Head.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.  It's nothing like the movie, this is the play, filmed.",1233187200,,829,3.9457831325301207

Although there are numerous differences between the musical and the movie, they are both absolutely worth seeing. I have seen the Broadway production three times and the movie at least a dozen and i love them both. To me they aren't meant to be compared. The Broadway production was the true RENT and i think the movie was a good addition...both capturing the meaning of ""No Day but Today"" in different ways. Please see this, it is such a good way to bring Broadway to your home if you weren't able to go to NY.",1233014400,,591,4.381818181818182
3686063,5,B001LMAKAQ,"I had the privilege of seeing the original Broadway cast in New York and fell in love even before I saw the show.  After seeing it from Row C, I was hooked.  I vowed then and there to never see a film version unless it contained the original cast.
I was not 100% amazed by the film version.  Changes are not usually my style and I was very hurt by the marginalization of Angel's deterioration.  However, it was able to reach out to a new generation of Rent fans.  I took a group of students to see it and we all left the theatre singing.
When I heard Rent was closing in NYC I would have loved to go out but it was not to be.  The filmed live for stage version was a way for all of us to experience the closing in a special way.
This filmed live for stage version, I feel, is the definitive version.  I mean no disrespect to the original cast and that performance was a life changing experience but THIS version is how I believe Larson wanted the story to be told.
I'm for owning every different version of Rent just on principle.  I own the OBC cd, the film soundtrack and DVD, the vocal selections book, the RENT ""yearbook,"" the script/libretto and now this.
Watch it large and loud!

I have enjoyed every version of RENT available.  I saw the ""Live on Broadway"" version in the theater and loved seeing the tears and facial expressions that are lost on row 20(and back) seats at a live performance.  I love the energy that you can only get from the live performance as well, but I saw the movie version 1st and am stunned at those who thought it did not do the the play justice. ""It"" is what brought me to the theater.  The original actors were a part of it and Jonathan's own family blessed it.  I think it could not have been done better in each of the 3 versions given to us. I only wish more ""live on Broadway"" performances would make it to the theaters, and with the ""original"" casts though.  Not everyone can make it to New York to see a show on Broadway and it is the original cast that gets nominated for Tony Awards, that's who I want to see in the bigscreen version.",1232755200,,1090,5.067039106145251
3686065,5,B001LMAKAQ,"When you watch a live performance of a concert or musical and if that Blu-ray goes as far as it can to replicate that live experience, you know you're going to have a enjoyable time.  ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" is a fantastic experience on Blu-ray from awesome picture quality, great sound utilization for those with a home theater and a disc loaded with featurettes with substance.  A solid and fantastic release for those who are passionate for the seventh longest running musical ever.

""RENT"" had been in development since 1988 and made a reality in 1994.  But the musical wouldn't become a success until its Broadway debut in Jan. 1996.  ""RENT"" is a reimagining of Giacomo Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"" and its modern setting and enjoyable characters and addictive music has captured so many hearts with its twelve year run.  It has won a Pulitzer Prize, four Tony Awards and credit has to go to the hardworking and passionate staff and its cast members who have put their heart and soul to ""RENT"", but this release is also a celebration of life and love, written by ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson.

From the actors getting on stage and everyone applauding to the ten minute intermission and then the final farewell in which the current cast and the original cast share the same stage and all sing ""Seasons of Love"", the final live performance was powerful and as for the Blu-ray, the additions of the bonus features will definitely attract the hardcore and even curious fans!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in 1080p high definition (1:78:1).  The picture quality was amazing on Blu-ray.  Picture quality was clear, colors were vibrant but most importantly, almost similar to any successful concert performance, what can make it or break a performance is how many camera angles are utilized, how they are edited and how well they cut from character to character.  And the good news is that this musical was successful in accomplishing the job.  Lighting was just right!  Performances were fantastic and the ability to cover each performer interacting on stage knowing that a camera is probably in their way, everything went quite well.  So, with the Blu-ray video transfer receiving high marks, how does the audio even compare?

As for the audio, audio is featured in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  And I have to let you know that if you own a home theater system with surround sound, how awesome the sound quality is.  In fact, for those who want that theatre experience like if you were watching it live.  The audio clearly features the dialogue and music from your front speakers.  But your rear surround speakers feature the audience.  I was blown away to hear the audience giggling, cheering and their overall excitement during the performance.  Although it doesn't beat being there for an actual live show, at least there was great care in making sure the audio was great.  So, it's like being in the front row and hearing the audience behind you.  Well done!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This is probably what is going to win the RENT-heads and those who admire or are curious about ""RENT"" will truly enjoy.  Lengthy special features targeted towards the fans of ""RENT"" and are featured in standard and hi-definition.  The majority of them are in HD.  Included are:

  * The Wall - This featurette focuses on how the fans have left hand written messages on the walls of Nederlander Theatre.  A good size featurette showcasing the various signatures written throughout the years and the goodbye messages from fans of the musical.  Very touching!
  * The Final Curtain -This featurette focuses on the original cast who were backstage and preparing to join the current cast for the final farewell and all of them united in their final goodbyes and singing ""Seasons of Love"" together.  Very touching and emotional to watch.
  * Home - This featurette was about how they chose the Nederland Theatre and how it was not quite hospitable and needed a lot of fixing up.  But even today, the interesting things about the theatre that the cast and crew share their experiences.  Answering questions of why the ceilings were not fully painted, the obstacles the crew had to face in getting it ready and much more.  An informative but also fun featurette.
  * The Final Lottery - Since moving to Nederland Theatre, there has been a lottery to RENT-heads who would camp outside in order to get the discounted $20 tickets for the show. Those who got tickets got to sit in the front two rows.  This segment features the final lottery, hundreds of people in line hoping to get a ticket for the final day and how emotional the experience was for the fans who won tickets for the final day and also how emotional it was for the two men in charge of giving out the tickets for the lottery.
  * Casting - A behind-the-scenes look at the casting for ""RENT"".  Every person who auditioned have been kept in dozens upon dozens of binders.  Each person who was cast had to be seen multiple times and you get quite a bit of insight on the casting and the experience of the current talent and how many times (and how many years) they auditioned to get a role in the musical.
  * Rent: The Final Days on Broadway - This is the lengthiest featurette featuring a specialized casting for the final week of ""RENT"" bringing back some old cast members but finding the right cast for the final week and the final day.  Bringing everyone together and an in-depth look at how emotional everyone was during the filming.  A lot of interviews with cast and crew.  Especially those  remembering ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson and bringing back the Larson family one last time for them to meet and greet the crew, staff and talent.  Touching and overall an awesome featurette!  But to see how emotional distraught some of the hardcore fans were on the final day was incredibly touching.  So many people touched by this musical and also the lives changed for the positive because of ""RENT"" was amazing.
  * Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation PSA - This featurette is about the foundation for those in the performing arts who can win a grant (to be used for anything, groceries, rent, babysitting, etc.) to help out performing artists.
  * National Marfan Foundation PSA - ""RENT"" creator Jonathan Larson died from an aortic aneurysm believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome.  And this informative PSA was letting people know about the genetic disorder and the National Marfan Foundation.

I was first introduced to ""RENT"" back in 2000.  As most musicals, my first introduction is typically by the soundtracks first but I have dreamed of  watching ""RENT"" in Broadway for many years and I ultimately thought that it was a musical I can just catch whenever and expected a long musical run.  So, when I found out that the long running musical would no longer be live in Broadway as of Sept. 7, 2008, I was saddened and felt that I lost my opportunity.

But after watching ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"", words can not describe how happy I was to hear about a Blu-ray release and how the live performance would be in High Definition.

The Blu-ray release was absolutely fantastic!  This is probably the next best thing of catching a Broadway show without having been there because not only was the picture quality outstanding but the way the audio was created, the awesome energy from the audience is felt through your surround sound.  The music just comes alive and everything was just done right when it comes to the video and audio presentation to DVD and Blu-ray translation from the final Broadway performance.  Camera angle cuts, editing, lighting, audience participation and more.  And if you thought the awesome performance of the musical was all your getting, ""RENT"" fans will not be disappointed because you get a good number of lengthy featurettes included on the special features section.

Although the Broadway performance of ""RENT"" is over, the long running musical is captured perfectly in ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" and is absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray! I wouldn't be surprise if this video became a cult-hit among the fans of the musical for many years to come. This release is not just a live performance, it's a celebration of life and a celebration of love.

If you are a fan of ""RENT"" or like myself, have always dreamed of watching ""RENT"" live, ""RENT: Filmed LIVE on Broadway"" is not only fantastic, it's highly recommended!",1232755200,48,8428,4.797362942401111

Created by a talented man by the name of Johnathan Larson ""Rent"" is about friends who live in the Lower East Side and deal with everyday things such as not having money, falling in love and dealing with AIDS. This opened young peoples eyes to the epidemic known as Aids. It showed us what Aids does to you and what you go through. In this story of friendship we have Angel, Mimi, Roger, Maureen, Roger, Mark, Joann and Collins. We go through their struggles in life. I saw this on stage before it closed in September and I was pleased with the way it was done. The songs were amazing and the cast was outstanding. Now I also seen this in the movies and I felt like it was new. The cameras zoomed in on the characters and I seen facial expressions I couldn't see at the play. That to me added to the experience and made it much more emotional for me. I am happy that it;s coming to DVD and Blu Ray cause now when I have kids I can share this amazing hit with them everyday.

I saw this movie in theatres in September and it was wonderful.  I agree with another poster that I would have liked more long shots to see the action on the entire stage, but I enjoyed it very much nonetheless, and as others have mentioned, cried straight through from Angel's death until the end credits.  Being a huge Adam Pascal fan, I was not expecting to love anyone else playing Roger, but Will Chase was awesome.  I was happy to see Tracie Thoms in it as well.

This is as close to the stage production you're going to get without actually being in a theater.  My only complaint is that I'm not too fond of the way Mimi comes off.  Rather than the fun, flirtatious, rough-around-the-edges Mimi I have come to know and love, this Mimi appears often angry with a voice that is almost too polished for the part.  The rest of the cast is stellar.  Despite my views on Mimi, I can't wait to own this disc!
