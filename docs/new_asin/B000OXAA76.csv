2801586,2,B000OXAA76,"Like most Japanese cinema, this film followed the standard route by starting out as a manga, then an anime series, and then finally made the transition to the big screen.

The story is based loosely on the Japanese mythological death gods, who keep death notebooks in which they write down the names of people destined to die.

In this story, one of the death gods throws down his notebook from heaven, where it is picked up by a precocious teenager Light Yagami. Once he figures out what he has in his hands, Light starts using the notebook to kill off all the criminals and other undesirable elements from society.

Meanwhile the Japanese police notice notice that gangsters are dying off in mysterious ways and try to find out what is happening. To aid them, they enlist the help of ""L"", another teenage genius (did I mention this was based on a comic book). And thus begins the battle of wits between L and Light.

It turns out this movie is the Japanese version of ""Kill Bill"" in the sense that one story was divided into two different movies. So after the first movie ended, the story is still a long way from concluding and it looks like I'm going to have make a second trip back to the video store to find out how everything will end. Knowing only half the story, it feels like I've only watched half a movie so far, but I will try and jot down a few thoughts nonetheless.

Although I've neither read the manga nor watched the anime, I suspect this is probably one of those stories that was better in the original format. There's a high body count in this movie, but most of the deaths are mysterious heart attacks caused by the death note, and so its not the kind of story that lends itself to a lot of action, explosions, and high speed chases.

Instead its more of a suspense movie, but unfortunately the director is no Alfred Hitchcock, and the tension is never as tight as it could be.

Also given the plot you might expect the movie to get into the moral issues between vigilante justice and whether the world would truly be a better place if we could just kill off all the bad apples. But again, the issue is only slightly touched.

I suppose I don't need to tell you that as Light continues to use the notebook his moral standards begin to slip. (If you're at all familiar with these kind of movies, you can see that a long way off). But an in depth look at what causes this shift is never provided. A better movie exploring some of these same themes might be ""The Last Supper"" (1995) although even that film slips into the obvious a bit. In both films it turns out (surprise) that taking justice into your own hands and killing off whoever you like is not a good idea. Phew, I'm glad we got that complicated moral problem solved.

Again I suspect this story line might have worked better in the comic or animation form, because given the nature of comic book stories we tend to suspend a lot more of our critical facilities when reading them. Once the story becomes live action and life like, you start to realize just how ridiculous a lot of the story is.

For example: just how many criminals who escaped justice are there wandering around the streets of Japan? I mean I know the Japanese Yakuza is famous for being outside the law, and I know Japanese courts can be famous for letting people off the hooks on technicalities (witness the Lucie Blackman case), but after a couple weeks of killing, you would think Light would run out of victims (especially since it appears he gets almost all of his names from the news).

And once L starts closing in on Light, Light does not stop his killing spree but goes through enormous difficulties to be able to escape L's detection and continue killing. Again, that might work in a comic book, but I had trouble believing a real live teenager would continue that obsession so far.",1180483200,5,3840,4.448079658605974

2801601,3,B000OXAA76,"I liked the anime series, so I thought I would check out these movies, and for this price why not!

I watched both of them.  The pacing of course feels a lot faster than the anime.  The actors do a pretty good job, I recognized the main character as being the same actor that payed the main character in Battle Royale (love it, the hunger games is partially based on it).  The movies were both ok, my main complaint is that the special effects are terrible.  The shinigami look terrible, like something out of a bad video game.  Other effects generally look pretty bad as well.  The movies were entertaining and I will probably watch them again.  The subtitles were good, and the English dubbed voices were also acceptable.

I especially am fond of this set because these movies come off more as two parts of a single film then two standalones so you able to see the complete story at once.  I also recommend this set in blu ray over any dvd set because the picture and audio quality differences are noticable as well.  If you are looking for a ton of special features, this set isn't ideal but it is one of the few sets to have both movies together and is alot cheaper then buying each movie seperately (at the time I bought it at least) so it has that going for it.",1365465600,,678,3.934306569343066
2801606,4,B000OXAA76,"I'll keep this short. I absolutely love the anime. Or at least I did up to a point. It decreased in quality to the point where it was down right rubbish. These movies made lots of changes, some large, some small. Most of the small changes I was not a fan of. A lot had to be missed due to the time restrictions a movie has as apposed to an anime series. Due to this many characters come off as not being as intelligent as they are meant to be. Certain precautions were skipped in order to shorten the run time which hurt the characters. But for the most part they can be overlooked. The larger changes I actually rather like. The anime had amazing moments, and was perfect up to a point, but took a turn down a path it never should have. The movies are lacking in these amazing moments, they are lacking in the original polish, they are lacking in a lot of things, but I ended up loathing the anime due to the path it took, and one of the major changes in the movies was not going down that path. Which I can only commend. It's the lesser of two evils in my opinion. It just works better and is more cohesive. If the anime annoyed you, I really would recommend this.",1364256000,,1166,4.140969162995595
2801607,4,B000OXAA76,"I love these movies (anime and manga).  The acting, the story, the conflict, the characters (ok, the eye candy that can act doesn't hurt, either), even the cgi is good.  In the wrong hands Death Note would be a bad joke.  This live action movie is a compelling showdown between Light and L with sides provoking thought about criminals, society, life, death and of course fan service.

Mine didn't come from Amazon, but did come from a legit brick and mortar (New People in SF, CA).
I'd bought these movies in other formats for other people.  I finally decided to get myself, my own blu ray copy.
Where's the collection that includes the 3rd made-for-tv movie?  What about a digital copies so I can be lazy and not have to rip it myself?
Also, the plastic that holds the discs in was snapped.  My discs floating around in the blu ray box.  What's the fun in owning the full price deal without any additional benefits, flawed disc and case?  I suppose I could have taken it back.  They might have been sold out and I didn't want something else or another store abused or aging plastic copy (whichever was the case).

Here's hoping they release a better set and then these blus will just be my beater copies.",1355184000,,1205,4.481651376146789

Having the original DVD's of Death Note, gave me a real opportunity to compare the variances between those (regular DVD) and the Blu-Ray disc.  Right from the beginning the blu ray disc is brighter, more detail in the resolution. The disc has the options of either English or Japanese language version.  The Death Note story in the movie form (live action) does not lose any of the suspense, drama, and the acting excels the live action to its own level of superiority. These are two great movies and I would recommend them to horror, suspense and Sherlock Holmes dialogic plot fans.",1351382400,,634,4.745454545454545
2801610,5,B000OXAA76,The 2 movies contained in this set do an amazing job of telling the story of Death Note with some noticeable changes in the story's progression.  One of the best things this adaptation does is cut out all the fluff that dragged down the second half of the anime.  Another great factor that helps boost these films credibility is the actors.  The cast of these films do an amazing job of representing their anime counterparts.,1345593600,,425,4.64

If you don't like anime or you've never watched Deathnote, this is definitely worth watching.  I admit that some of the acting - mostly only in the beginning - is a little much and hard to get over, but the core story here is really superb.  For the more narrow-minded, I'd wait until the american remake - which is inevitable; there is a lot of culture ingrained in this movie, and its best to wait for it to be americanized to catch the awesome story.

2801614,4,B000OXAA76,"An intriguing idea: what if a person was given the ability to kill anyone by just writing their name in a book (as in, the pen is mightier than the sword).  What would such a person do with this new found power?  In this case, that person is a law student named Light.  Sadly, he is a tyrannical villain (to the nth degree), willing to kill anyone who gets in his way of creating an ideal world.  The problem is he has a skewered vision of what is idyllic.  Cops and crooks, they're all the same to him: obstacles.
I guess you could say this was a prime example of ""absolute power corrupts absolutely.""  Naturally, Light doesn't see himself as the villain, rather, he sees himself as a champion of justice; he isn't a mass murderer.  In his mind, people trying to thwart his plans are as equally bad as the killers and crooks he's trying to rid the world of.  So when a task force is set up to find him, he joins it.

Oh yes, he has a cartoon sidekick which takes a bit of getting used to, and when more death books pop up......It begs the question, why is this happening and why hasn't it happened before?  And why do these particular people get the books?

I'll keep this short and sweet, but overall the movies themselves are just okay, IMO. The first one is the better of the two, with some changes here and there that irked me a bit, but I was surprised the tone was consistent with the anime series. I can't compare to the manga just yet, as I'm reading Volume II right now only. The second film, however, changes far too much for my liking, that I thought it was a near drag to watch, and a slap to the face to the fans of the series. I mean... well, let me stop. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean. They failed to introduce or even MENTION at least 3 other very important characters that were in the anime series, and thought it was alright to change each characters roles. That pissed me off. The dubbing was pretty good, as most of the actors who dub it are the ones from the anime, although for obvious reasons the lips don't synch as well as they did in the anime. Still, great effort from the guy who voiced Light Yagami.

The Blu-ray, however, left nothing to disappoint as the visuals were sharp with life-like colors, deep blacks and handled the CGI well, which is good, but nothing compared to American CGI. Still, it had a cartoon-y feel which made it feel truer to the anime. Audio was just as good with vocals coming out crisp and locations of voices distinct. If you're going to buy this release, go Blu-ray, no doubt.

Overall, the Blu-ray made me enjoy it a tad more for how well it looked and sounded. Still, the movies as a whole upset me with the many changes done, especially in the second movie. I mean, Rem is supposed to be a woman's voice, not a guy's! It's like M. Night had something to do with these choices. Ugh. Still, if you're a fan who has seen the anime, read the 13 volumes of the manga and crave more Death Note, feed your curiosity by watching this. If you feel you must watch this series without prior knowledge of the anime, PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR... watch the anime first, as although most of the two share the same plot points, the anime delivers in a captivating style and is MUCH, MUCH more intriguing. Thanks for reading, and hope some of you can agree with me. They're not bad movies, just too many changes for a fan of the anime to warrant it's great.

Overall, it was put together well and the blu-ray quality is beautiful. My boyfriend had mixed emotions about it because he wanted it to follow the anime storyline better, so you should go in with an open mind. I kind of wish I watched the movie first to see if I could catch on to what was going on without knowing the anime first, because I think I would have been confused about what was going on in some places. I thought the actors were PERFECT for their roles, I thought I was watching the characters in the anime. I loved the CGI for the Shinigami, their characters were perfect and Ryuk is so funny.

2801624,4,B000OXAA76,"It would have been impossible to condense all of the rich detail and psychological drama from the manga and anime versions of Death Note into these two live-action films, so this is an adaptation rather than a remake. But given the constraints of the medium, the filmmakers did a great job, making an entertaining pair of bookends that tells the story of the Death Note - an object that provides its user with the power to kill with the stroke of a pen - and the fall from grace of Light Yagami, an earnest and dedicated student and son who develops megalomaniacal tendencies as soon as the book falls into his possession.

This Blu-Ray transfer is good; the movies have already been released on DVD, but obviously if you want top quality, this is the way to go. Audio transfer is excellent, and Japanese and dubbed English dialogue soundtracks are included. The voice acting for the English dub is much better than average; the producers used the same voice actors who dubbed the anime, so they're intimately familiar with the stories and characters.

The production quality itself was quite good too. The actors who portray Light and his nemesis, the quirky detective known as L, are astonishingly close to their anime/manga counterparts, and it's a special treat to see Takeshi Kaga (best known to Japanophile Americans as ""Chairman Kaga"" in the original ""Iron Chef"" show) as Light's father. The CGI used to create Ryuk and Rem, the two shinigami - death gods who are so central to the storyline - is effective although perhaps a bit lacking the sort of polish you'd expect from an high-budget Hollywood production.

Special features document the making of the two movies.",1285372800,11,1675,4.829268292682927
2801625,4,B000OXAA76,"contrary to popular belief, The live action death note movies actually predate the Anime by a couple of months in Japan, so the Live action movies are the original adaption of the Managa.

These movies a great. A delve into the mind of a wannabe god, and man who'll do anything to catch him. Light/Kira (Kira being how the Japanese say ""killer"") (played by Tatsuya Fujiwara, of Battle Royale fame), is a more than average law student when he finds a notebook which says that any persons whose name is written in the book will die. After trying it out, he trys to rebuild the world by killing the criminals (convenient because they post the criminals face and name on the TV all the time). This catches the attention of L (played by Ken'ichi Matsuyama), a super detective with a super sweet tooth who vows to do anything to catch ""kira"" and bring him to justice.

The series is known for blurring of the lines between good and evil. For example, both Light and L consider themselves good, they both do bad things to reach their goals. For example L locks Light up for a month in solitary confinement, even after it seems that Light isn't Kira.

The films do take a different route for the ending. In the Anime and Manga, Light kills L with the death note, and NEAR catches Light. In the movies, L writes his own name in the death note with the instructions that he dies in a month. And L catches Light.

The movies have both the original Japanese audio tracks with subtitles, and an English dub performed by the English cast of the Anime series.

I only gave it 4 star because it does not include the third part ""L: Change the World"" which details L's last month on earth after catching Light and destroying the death note(s).

Over all, this is a great purchase and something to hold you over till they release a blu-ray set of the anime. (which is unlikely since the Anime was shot on 16mm film to save money. This is the case with almost all Anime untill a year or so back).",1284422400,3,1976,4.4
2801626,5,B000OXAA76,"Based on the popular manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide and the live action ""Death Note"" films (including the third, ""L"" film) have been popular among fans who have enjoyed this film featuring a battle of wits between Light Yagami and L.

With the ""Death Note"" films previously released on DVD from Viz Pictures in the U.S., many have wondered if there would be a Blu-ray release due to the films being released on BD in Japan.

""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and the theme song ""Dani California"" (for ""Death Note"") and ""Snow (Hey Oh)"" (for ""Death Note II: The Last Name"") by the popular rock band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.

The film focuses on Light Yagami (Fujiwara), an intelligent student who wants to work in criminal law and follow his father's footsteps and catch criminals. But one day after hacking into the police department's computer system, Fujiwara is just sickened to know that the police has released criminals who should be incarcerated. One night, Yagami discovers a notebook called ""Death Note"" that has specific rules:

-The human whose name is written in this note shall die.

-This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their
mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will
not be affected.

-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,
it will happen.

-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart
attack.

-After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

-This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the
ground of (arrives in) the human world.

-The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner,
i.e. a god of death.

-The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.

Anxious to test this book out, Light writes the name of a criminal, thinking that the book is a joke. That is until the person's name that was written actually dies. Thus Light finds a way to get justice and does what he can to rid the world of all evil and become ""the God of the new world"".

He also meets the owner of the Death Note, a shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk, who is fascinated by Light of his ways of killing the criminals but the way his mind works.

Light who uses the name ""Kira"" starts writing the names of criminals in the Death Note and each die by heart attack and thus causing a frenzy in the media and the police force who now need to go after the person killing the criminals. But Kira is not your average criminal, as he is quickly generating a large fandom of people who support Kira's goal of eliminating criminals.

Of course, the police force led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, has no idea of how to go after this criminal but unbeknownst to them is a mysterious person that goes by the name of L. An intelligent detective who has an unorthodox way of catching criminals and so far, has been very succesful with his cases worldwide.

The cat and mouse chase has begun as L goes after Kira and Kira realizes his greatest enemy is L and thus the battle begins.

The film stars an all-star cast with ""Battle Royale"" actor Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light Yagami, Kenichi Matsuyama who starred in films ""Linda Linda Linda"" and ""NANA"" as the mysterious detective L.

Joining the two is one of Japan's most popular actress, Asaka Seto as Naomi Misora, a former FBI agent who's fiance is killed by Kira. Model and actress Yu Kashii as Light's girlfriend Shiori Akino. Shigeki Hosokawa as FBI Agent Raye who is hot on the trail of catching Kira, actress Erika Toda who plays the character of pop star Misa Amane and Takeshi Kaga, best known for the host of the original ""Iron Chef"", who plays the role as Light's father and head of police, Soichiro Yagami.

In the second film, ""Death Note II: The Last Name"", we learn that another individual has the ""Death Note"".  Her name is Misa Amane, a pop star and TV talent who has shortened her life span for the eyes of the shinigami.  This allows her to see the names of the individuals and thus easy to write them down on the Death Note.  She is a follower of Kira and all she wants is to be with him.  And thus, she murders innocent people in order to get the attention of Light.

Upon meeting Misa, Light realizes that with her ""eyes"", he can use her to finally kill his nemesis L. But with L and the police suspecting Light as Kira and Misa as Kira II, Light devises a plan.  With Misa Amane captured by the police force, he submits himself to being captured and being held by the police.  But he has given Misa's Death Note to another person.  A newscaster named Kiyomi Takada who also idolizes Kira and his mission and is willing to further his plan of eliminating criminals.

Now the police force who has both Light and Misa in custody in order to find out if they are both Kira now have a new threat in the outside world.  Who can outwit the other and who will become the victor - Kira or L?

The film is 140 minutes long, pacing was indeed well done and overall, despite being different from the manga and anime series, both Shusuke Kaneko and Tetsuya Oishii managed to come up with a thrilling, dark and gripping storyline that remains faithful to the overlying theme of the film.

VIDEO:

""Death Note"" and ""Death Note II: The Last Name"" are presented in 1080p High Definition and everything about these two films on Blu-ray looks much better and more vibrant than its DVD counterpart.

You can see the detail for example on the wooden grain of Light's bedroom doorway, the metallic finish of his cell phone to the pixels of the screen on his cell phone and the strands of Light's hair much clearly.

The film features a fine layer of grain, Colors pop out much more especially during the day light sequences, blacks are nice and deep and I don't recall seeing any major compression artifacts or DNR.

Probably only one scene where I felt there was a bit of low-light noise seen on the blacks and reds (a scene before the ending credits of ""Death Note II"") but for the most part, the picture quality for both films are very good.

My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk and Rem. And how that would translate on film and the two shinigami look exactly like it does in the anime and manga series but Rem seems to look more less detailed than Ryuk. But overall, the CG works with the film.  It's important to note that the CG was created in 2005-2006, so one should not compare this to 2009 ""Avatar"" or Pixar-based animation with heavy detail.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Death Note"" and ""Death Note II: The Last Name"" are presented in Japanese and English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  As for the lossless audio, this is another highlight of the Blu-ray version as I found the dialogue and musical soundtrack to be crisp and clear through the front and center channels.

The gunshots and crowd and overall ambiance (doors latching, stairs being climbed, etc.) is well-featured throughout the film through the surround channels.  I was pretty impressed of how much the audio stood out through the surround channels versus when I watched both films originally on DVD.  Ryuk and Rem's voice echoes through the surround channels, certain movements can be heard through the surround channels and also certain parts of the musical score are played through the surround channels as well.

I found that ""Death Note II: The Last Name"" had a bit more surround sound usage with vehicles crashing, thunder, gun shots and a bit more destruction utilized in the sequel.

As for LFE, I didn't really catch any major booms through my subwoofer during the more action-based scenes but mainly during the bass sequences of the music-filled sequences or during a sequence when Light had touched a Death Note.

I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series.

So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The ""Death Note Collection"" comes with the following special features:

  * Making of Death Note - (50:00) Featuring the making of ""Death Note"" and interviews with the director, talent and behind-the-scenes of the making of various scenes from the original film.  A weekly video journal of various scenes and how they were shot.
  * Making of Death Note II: The Last Name - (50:00) Featuring the making of ""Death Note II: The Last Name"" and interviews with the director, talent and behind-the-scenes of the making of various scenes from the sequel. A weekly video journal of various scenes and how they were shot.

JUDGMENT CALL:

First, let me say how happy I was to find out that both ""Death Note"" films were coming out on Blu-ray and even happier when I found out that they would be bundled together.  I enjoyed both films when they came out and although different from the manga and anime series (as you can only fit so much into two 2-hour films), the writers managed to craft two films that were fine on its own despite its difference from the original storyline.

But even with the slight changes, everything worked out. The pacing was well done, the CGI of Ryuk was well done. But those changes from the original series is what gives the film it's own life.

Unlike the manga and anime series, Naomi Misora (Seto) has a slightly different role, as does Shiori Akino (Kashii) that plays a major pivotal role early in the series of how demented Light has become, even with a followup comment by Ryuk. Fantastic!

But the plus for this film was the talent involved. Tatsuya Fujiwara is such an impressive actor that it was great to see him take on the role of Light Yagami. To see Fujiwara's acting show the believable and caring Light Yagami evolve into the killer known as Kira was just fantastic. Kenichi Matsuyama as L was also well done.

But of course, the addition of other talents such as Asaka Seto. She's such a popular TV drama and film star that it was great to see her as the vengeful Naomi Misora and it's great to see Mr. ""Iron Chef"" Takeshi Kaga as Soichiro Yagami.

I was extremely pleased with the first live action film and the treatment it has received on DVD. I enjoyed watching it in Japanese but watching it again with the voice actors of the original anime series. Again, I'm not fond with English dubbing for a lot of Asian films but VIZ was smart in utilizing the voice actors for the anime series on this live film. Well done!

""DEATH NOTE II: The Last Name"" was extremely popular in Japan. Having been #1 in the box office for five weeks and earning 5.5 Billion yen in Japan, the film was a major success.

I enjoyed the film a lot and the pacing was much better with the second film but if anything was amazing, it was Tetsuya Oishii's screenplay.

It is challenging to get so much storyline from the manga and making a live action film.  There is so much story in the ""Death Note"" manga that it would be difficult to translate all that in two films.  So, there had to be major differences in the live film versus the manga and unfortunately, for many films based from a long manga series, they don't succeed because they try to condense everything into one film.

As for ""Death Note II: The Last Name"", Oishii manages to create a new storyline that is so different from the manga series but yet manages to stay within the confines of the main focal point.  Kira vs. L and finding a right conclusion. Having the storyline so different from the manga, I was pleasantly surprised by it but by the film's end, I was rather pleased.  Both Kaneko and Oishii pulled it off.

What I love about this film is that Kira and L are two individuals who are intelligent and the way they try to outdo each other, is always amazing.

In a way, it's like a chess game between these two as they do what they can to outwit each other. Also, I enjoyed seeing how many other characters were integrated into the overall storyline.  And knowing how different this film is from the manga and anime series, I was satisfied with the conclusion of the film and overall, I really enjoyed the sequel.  Good storytelling by Oishii and managing to pull of a storyline that is just as satisfying as the manga but yet quite different.

If you enjoyed the first live film, then you will definitely want to pick up the sequel.  ""Death Note II: The Last Name"" is a thrilling, suspenseful and enjoyable film.

Overall, this collection is pretty awesome because you do get both films in one set, you also get the films in HD and lossless English and Japanese audio as well.  And you also get the special features in a third disc and there was no skimping by Viz Pictures for their first major Blu-ray release.

It's important to note that the special features that were on the original DVD release are not the same.  The special features on the Blu-ray are longer and actually feature the making of, whereas the first ""Death Note"" DVD featured only the interview with the director and ""Death Note II"" DVD featured a 23-minute interview with the director and talent of the film.

I know there are some people who wish the ""L"" film was included with this set but this collection focuses primarily on ""Death Note"" especially the psychological battle between Light Yagami versus L.  And although not as heavy on the details like the manga or animated series, these two films turned out quite well on its own and is definitely recommended!",1283731200,31,14235,4.560314341846758
2801627,5,B000OXAA76,"Shusuke Kaneko's ""Death Note"" films are awesome. I bought Viz Pictures' dvd versions of ""Death Note"", ""Death Note: The Last Name"" and Hideo Nakata's ""L: Change The World"" and I was really impressed with them. When I put in the blu-rays of both ""Death Note"" films, I was blown away. They look phenomenal in 1080p and they definitely have that HD pop to them with many elements looking 3-dimensional. I have already imported the blu-rays of the ""20th Century Boys"" trilogy, ""Kaiji: Gambling Apocalypse"" and ""Ultra Galaxy: Mega Monster Battle: The Movie"". I was patiently waiting for the ""Death Note"" films to be released on blu-ray in the good ole United States. It was well worth the wait. HANDS DOWN MUST-BUY!!! This release gets a 10/10. If you even remotely enjoy foreign films or even just outstanding thriller mysteries with a touch of horror and a test of wits, do not hesitate to buy this collection. You will not be disappointed.

2801631,4,B000OXAA76,"The Live action version of Death Note definitely shows the side of Light Yagami they couldn't show on the anime series. Having Light as a college  student was a much better choice than what the manga and the anime series had him as a high school which a more creepy scary element to it. This Light is simply sick and tired of the way the Japanese Police Department was treating their criminals and not giving them a much harsher punishment.

2801633,5,B000OXAA76,"I went into this movies somewhat similar to how i went into the Harry Potter films. I went in thinking it would be line for line image for image. And when I got about a third into it i was mistaken. Now I feel that Death Note, the live-action film gave the Manga/Anime the credit it needed. It followed the characters and the basic story line. It also did change some key elements. Such as Raye's wife, and his girlfriend. But in all understanding it made sense. To do this made it more time effective. If you are coming into this movie expecting it to be the anime series with real people, you shall be sadly mistaken the film running at 120 minutes would never be able to cover 37 twenty-two minute episodes in that time frame. thus it was broken up into about 4 hours compressing the story and trying to keep it's key elements.

I have yet to see Death Note: The Last Name, but I hope to soon purchase it and see how they do the rendition for the rest of the story.",1204934400,2,968,4.204301075268817
2801634,5,B000OXAA76,"""Death Note"" was a much better flick than I was expecting.  It was a huge hit in Japan, and because I had never read the original manga, I had avoided it thinking I wouldn't get the entire story.  My loss, as it turns out.

The cat-and-mouse detective game mixed with the fantasy elements of the gods of death and their magical books makes for an interesting story.  The two main characters, ""L"" and Light, are an intense duo, and like the best of this genre of film it is hard to decide who to root for.  Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara, ""Battle Royale""), known by the general public as the hero/murderer ""Killer"", is the holder of the Death Note, and has the power to kill anyone on Earth just by writing their name.  A hardcore and brilliant student of criminal justice, he uses his power to erase the vermin of the world, serial killers, child rapists and gangsters. For the most part, his actions are praised, but he is still a murderer in the eyes of the law, and needs to be brought down.  On his side is the Ryuuk, a Japanese god of death who gave Light the Death Note in order to keep himself entertained. Hunting him down in ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama, ""Linda,Linda, Linda""), a young, oddball genius with a penchant for sweets who keeps his name hidden in order to protect himself from the powers of the Death Note.  L hunts Light, and Light hunts L, and it is never clear who is the person a step ahead, and who is the fly falling into the web.

Director Shusuke Kaneko, who cut his teeth on Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman flicks, managed to keep the story close enough to the manga to please the fans while making it complete enough that newcomers don't feel that they are only getting a part of the picture.  The CG animated Ryuuk stands out at first, but soon becomes a natural part of the storyline, and Kaneko's familiarity with the special effects learned from the monster films did him good service.  All of the actors do a great job, particularly  Fujiwara and Matsuyama as L and Light, who carry the movie on the strength of their performances.

""Death Note"" was a great enough film that it had me running to pick up the sequel, which actually makes a single film ""Kill Bill""-style, as well as checking out the manga and the spin-off flick ""L:Change the World"".  All of them are high quality, and all of them are recommended.",1204243200,5,2333,4.471698113207547
2801635,5,B000OXAA76,"This movie is based on the popular manga series Death Note which was very popular in Japan. For those of you who like L I highly recomend this movie for he is perfectly portrayed. The movie stays pretty true to the story line of books 1-3, however scene cuts were made or scenes from other books were edited together, and there is the addition of a character, Light's girlfriend. The one main difference is how Light gets on the investigation team, which makes up the ending of the movie, however you'll have plenty of laughs and if you are a fan of Death Note the screenwriters did a pretty good job of bringing this to a movie, way better than any American screenwriter could have done. Overall I rate this movie a 5, mostly just for L.",1183334400,11,738,4.394160583941606
2801636,5,B000OXAA76,"Death Note is based on the popular manga(Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I saw a couple episodes of the anime, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan In a while. I will review both films because one movie while phenomenal and definitely can stand on its own, the story is very much linked together.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:
In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.

In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami, brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.

As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.

That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?
Man has no right to play GOD.
This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films.

Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is not anime, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass a lot of films in plot)

I have both Death Note and Death Note the Last name, both in region-3 DTS special edition, Dual Layer originals, I believe there is no Official region-1 or 0 released. I'm not sure what is sold in Amazon.
PICTURE: Anamorphic Widescreen 1.78 ratio. The picture is flawless. Colors are natural, smooth and sharp. I did not notice any artifacts.
AUDIO/Subtitles: 5.1 Dolby Digital/6.1 DTS-ES in Japanese. The sound is crisp and loud. You really have to have DTS for this film. The English subs are well-timed and well translated.
EXTRAS:Trailers, Director interviews, commentary, making of featurettes/behind the scenes. The twin pack contains a photo book.

In Closing: Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
These two films have been selected at the 2007 New York film festival.
