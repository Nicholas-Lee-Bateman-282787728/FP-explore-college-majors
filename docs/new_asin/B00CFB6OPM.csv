5721031,5,B00CFB6OPM,I was so impressed by Dominic Purcell's acting in this film. I loved him in Prison Break but I though he brought so much depth to his character and really delivered! I was also impressed by the story line. I watch action movies not expecting them to have good story lines and I though Assault on Wall Street had an exceptional one! This film will definitely be in my own personal DVD collection!,1368662400,18,395,4.424657534246576
5721042,4,B00CFB6OPM,Slasher movie with a gun. First half of the movie emotionalizes you to prepare you for the final 40 minutes of Gore.,1526774400,,116,4.318181818181818
5721043,5,B00CFB6OPM,I loved it!  This is a great movie to watch.  It has it's ups and downs but by the end you are hooked.,1526601600,,102,3.391304347826087
5721044,1,B00CFB6OPM,same old anti capitalist crap. Political undertones. wack.,1526601600,,58,6.375
5721045,1,B00CFB6OPM,Terrible dark fantasy. True Wall Street vultures profited ... remember also that the creators of this did as well. To make a buck they created a film that feeds a dark soul. If I could give this a negative rating I would.,1526256000,,221,4.285714285714286
5721046,5,B00CFB6OPM,This movie has been the greatest movie I have seen within the last few months. OMG I'm surprised i didn't discover this sooner. Definitely recommend.,1526169600,,149,5.0

5721048,5,B00CFB6OPM,Love the ending. But it would be better if put more emphasis on the killing and planning. We don't care the reason that much. Everyone knows the Wall St. is evil.,1526083200,,162,4.258064516129032
5721049,1,B00CFB6OPM,Horrible movie in every aspect.,1525910400,,31,5.4
5721050,5,B00CFB6OPM,"WOW! Falling Down meets Wall St. Watching the transformation of one man, by Mr. Purcell, due to the compound of tragedies one right after another demonstrates how a soldier acquires the ""1,000-yard stare, and he shows the viewer his. He just wants to take care of his wife but she has other plans and it hurts bad. The movie is a little slow in parts but picks up the pace after adequate character deterioration that gets you behind him and even rationalize his actions. If you remember Michael Douglas just wanting to get home, Dominic Purcell just wants his money like 99.99% of the country did or still does. Revenge is a dish best served cold, well this dish is served red HOT! No spoiler but, nice twist in the end.",1525824000,6,720,4.5038167938931295
5721051,1,B00CFB6OPM,"So slow that I kept skipping forward to see if it ever got interesting.  At about 1 hour in, it final picked up steam, but was still choppy.

It seamed like every time something interesting was about to occur, it cut to a walking scene, diner scene, or some other scene that didn't add any thing of importance.

Not much of a thriller nor action movie.",1525651200,,352,4.303030303030303

5721055,4,B00CFB6OPM,"Good movie overall, but had a lot of scenes where more work could've been done to make it look a little more real. Good movie to depict what happened to so many people during the 2008 stock market crash.",1523750400,,203,4.230769230769231
5721056,2,B00CFB6OPM,"The beginning was just so painfully slow. I get that they were trying to build a mood, but it could have been done in a fraction of the time that they did. It felt like 60 minutes of sandbagging before getting to the part that the title advertises.

There's about 30 minutes of decent action movie and the rest is fluff.",1523750400,,320,4.245901639344262

5721059,2,B00CFB6OPM,Skip the first half.  Decent action movie... as long as you don't look too closely.,1523059200,,83,4.533333333333333
5721060,3,B00CFB6OPM,"Most Americans don't have the means to invest and typically live half a moment away from a medical crisis that they literally won't survive because of the greed of our for-profit healthcare system. This movie examines what happens when people who have a bit of means are forced to live like the rest of us. Spoiler alert: we don't get to shoot up the bankers, so neither should middle to upper-class white dudes who are just waking up to what the rest of us have known for years.",1522972800,,479,4.454545454545454
5721061,1,B00CFB6OPM,"This movie is disgusting and highly disturbing all around, this is the type of thing that serves as inspiration for psychopaths to go on mass shooting sprees under the gisue ""protecting the weak"". For anyone normal who watches this you should see the antigun conclusion towards the end and unfortunately they made a very strong case for it while simultaneously making Socialism sound appealing.

If I could rate into the negative I would and then some.",1522368000,,452,4.947368421052632
5721062,5,B00CFB6OPM,Excellent....  he is great actor.  The movie made perfect sense in this corrupt world of  wall street and banking.,1522195200,,114,4.894736842105263

5721064,4,B00CFB6OPM,"I think it is a good movie in all aspects. It would be always better to tell a story rather than abstract descriptions or explanation of a phenomenon.
I wish all that happened in this movie would be true so that at least some of the Wall Street criminals got some punishments. But the truth is that bad guys did not get any loss or penalty by any kinds. Some opinions insist that it was a systematic fault rather than individual's as every individual in a capitalist society pursues their own best interests while other's well being would not count. But the fact is that, as what I saw, innocent mass hard working people tolerate the total collapse.

I hope we will never get this economic or financial crash in future.",1521590400,,719,4.488549618320611
5721065,2,B00CFB6OPM,Sounded like a decent plot but I couldn't stand all the swearing. I wish producers would make more stuff that didn't have all the extra baggage.,1521331200,2,144,4.576923076923077

I did not like the fact that he was justifying killing people to make himself feel better.. was hoping he was going to rob them not kill them.. but what happened to him is what happened to a lot of people and it's a sad truth.. banks, wall street etc... they could care less about the people that invest and lose there life saving.. the rich always stay rich.. and big company's can do whatever they want to save there own skin and get away with it every day..",1520208000,,534,4.144230769230769

5721070,5,B00CFB6OPM,"It was a great movie.  I'm a big Dominic Purcell fan.  However, this movie also strikes an unsettling cord.  The writers put four powerful, real American experiences in one movie: Wall Street being careless and causing the financial melt down, medical bankruptcies that crush families, an official system of politics and law that protects us less than we expect, and a terrorist/active shooter who plays out what we all would think about doing if we were in his shoes.  Like I said, it's a great movie, but it scared me a little because parts of it are a little too true.  I want something better than this movie for our country in real life.",1519948800,,642,4.5964912280701755

It is very relvant to the issues our country is facing now, and it is a good personal insight into what so many Americans are facing. This movie made me cry, so hard, but it also made me experience a sense of personal prowess at the idea of facing the white colar criminals on Wall Street. It has an amazing story line, its heartfelt, it really brings you into the plot, and while the main things that happen are predictable, it still gets to you and the ending is absolutely Amazing.",1518739200,3,531,4.215686274509804

5721093,3,B00CFB6OPM,"Shades of Taxi Driver. Two people's lives are destroyed by the Wall Street debacle of 2008 fame. Not very well acted, and exploits the (righteous) hatred of the finance industry. The last act and climax was fun, but as we all know, most people that are ruined by the corrupt banking and investment industry just die quietly and anonymously. This kind of revenge theme is very simple and can gratify one's outrage about Wall Street corruption, but this solution is obviously not tenable. Most people would cheer this protagonist, but never take realistic action toward voting in better Congressional candidates who allow this exploitation of investors. In that way this movie is as exploitative as Wall Street, promising a cheap thrill but you come away realizing you've been had.",1518480000,,779,5.046511627906977
5721094,4,B00CFB6OPM,"The movie effects and acting was okay, but what was great is that it got the feelings of everyday people correct.  As common people are being screwed by the high paying executives of Wall Street, and people lost their retirement and savings by executive decisions that offered personal financial gains for the executives with little concern for everyday investors, this film expressed what people want after seeing these executives not getting arrested or punished for their wrong doing.  It felt good watching someone finally assault Wall Street executives and got away with it.  This is the current feeling of the people who lost so much by dumb decisions executives made with our money.  These executives continue to operate in this manner and encourage people to continue to invest in nonsense funds/investment vehicles.",1518480000,,824,5.21969696969697

I only gave it 3 stars because I cannot stand when hollywood either does not know anything about gun laws, how they work, or they are just trying to make some political point about guns. The first big mistake, you can tell this guy was not some kind of gun collector, yet he had a full auto M4 in his closet. This gun requires a class 3 license and is not easy to get. We know he was a law abiding citizen upto this point. If somehow he did have a license for it, I think he would have sold it before then as it is worth well over 20G. All the practice shooting he was doing in the train tunnel, get real, those shot sounds would have carried for a long way in those NY City tunnels, and he would have had the cops on him fast. Then when the cops shoot the broker in the end they shoot in in the upper left abdomen  area. If he was to die from this shot, it most likely would have been on the operating table. He would not had just instantly dropped dead, but most likely would have been screamming in pain.

Spoilers throughout:

He's a constant whiner and name-caller throughout the movie, just like an annoying teenager would be, and his only solution is to kill a couple culprits along with TONS of innocent random people....and he's supposed to be some kind of hero? To me he just came across as a low IQ'ed immature whiny baby who murders people.

And his wife killing herself? She's a total jerk for doing that to him.

It's funny because the script writers want the viewer to take pity on this couple, and while I did empathize with her having cancer, everything else they did was simply them being dumb, then when their dumb choices came back at them, they blamed others.

It's disturbing that that so many people like this movie, because the whole attitude behind the story supports juvenile and selfish behavior.

- (baby crying) wah wah waaaaahhh I lost all my money
- ""waaaah waaaaah waaaaaaahhhhh""
- ""waaaaaaaahh""
- ""waaah""
- gets a bunch of guns and kills everybody he sees

5721163,1,B00CFB6OPM,"Only some sick, twisted, leftist would give five stars to a movie clearly glorifying the mass murder of dozens of people, most of whom are total strangers to the main character.  For those bright enough to recognize it, this is a Marxist masterpiece using same, tired old common themes... Reading some of the 5 star reviews here, its amazing how quickly people fall for such leftist propaganda.  The economic harm that occurred during this era was caused by the collapse of the subprime market in mortgages.  This happened because loans were given to people with poor credit, primary because Federal Government demanded that the banks make these loans.  This absolute fact.  The origins of the problem came from Democrats who wanted to socialize home ownership by providing sub-prime loans to minorities and poor people who were under-represented in the home ownership market.  This resulted in the Community Reinvestment Act, passed under the Carter Administration.  Heres the proof, an exact quote from the law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 seeks to address discrimination in loans made to individuals and businesses from low and moderate-income neighborhoods.[7] The Act mandates that all banking institutions that receive Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance be evaluated by Federal banking agencies to determine if the bank offers credit (in a manner consistent with safe and sound operation as per Section 802(b) and Section 804(1)) in all communities in which they are chartered to do business.[3] The law does not list specific criteria for evaluating the performance of financial institutions. Rather, it directs that the evaluation process should accommodate the situation and context of each individual institution. Federal regulations dictate agency conduct in evaluating a bank's compliance in five performance areas, comprising twelve assessment factors. This examination culminates in a rating and a written report that becomes part of the supervisory record for that bank.[8]

In other words, we will be watching you, and you better loan to people with poor credit or we will give you a bad record.

Even today, the Fed Government admits the CRA is designed for social engineering: http://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/cra_about.htm  ""The Community Reinvestment Act is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods...""

It couldn't be more clear.  The Democrats pushed this on banks (e.g. Barney Frank), then blamed it on the banks to avoid criticism themselves when it failed.  And the clapping seal libtards fell for it.  But think about it, without the CRA, why would any bank make a loan to people who had little chance of paying it back?  Theres NO money to be made in that.  The answer of course is that they were encouraged/forced to by Federal law or risk fines for failing to comply.  Then Fannie and Freddie (which are also quasi-governmental institutions), stepped in and pushed it further, offering to buy these loans or package them into securities, making the enticement for banks even stronger.  There is absolute proof in numerous studies that banks took risks they would not have otherwise without the CRA.  Anyhow, Im sure there will be lots of leftists making comments on this postpeople who know nothing about investing, the banking system, or hard work in general.  Such people are never convinced by factsso I won't be reading their comments.  This article is written for the open minded, hard-working peoplethose willing to dig into the facts rather than just parroting the talking points of the drive-by media.

Heres some more proof:
http://reason.com/blog/2012/12/21/study-says-community-reinvestment-act-in

'twas Wall Street greed what done it, some folks say, when it comes to explaining the spectacular housing meltdown of recent years, which had its roots in a great many astonishingly risky loans. Other folks suggest that the federal government just may have played something of a role in inducing, even strong-arming, banks to take risks they otherwise would have avoided. Specifically, the Community Reinvestment Act and related policy pressures are pointed to as culprits, part of a government effort to extend home-ownership in lower-income neighborhoods. Now comes a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research that says, quite bluntly. that the CRA played a major role.

""In the academic world, mealy-mouthed delivery of even powerful conclusions is the norm, so it's refreshing to see authors Sumit Agarwal, Efraim Benmelech, Nittai Bergman, Amit Seru answer the title's question, ""Did the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Lead to Risky Lending?,"" with the clear, ""Yes, it did. ... We find that adherence to the act led to riskier lending by banks."" The full abstract reads:""

""Yes, it did. We use exogenous variation in banks incentives to conform to the standards of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) around regulatory exam dates to trace out the effect of the CRA on lending activity. Our empirical strategy compares lending behavior of banks undergoing CRA exams within a given census tract in a given month to the behavior of banks operating in the same census tract-month that do not face these exams. We find that adherence to the act led to riskier lending by banks: in the six quarters surrounding the CRA exams lending is elevated on average by about 5 percent every quarter and loans in these quarters default by about 15 percent more often. These patterns are accentuated in CRA-eligible census tracts and are concentrated among large banks. The effects are strongest during the time period when the market for private securitization was booming.""",1437091200,2,5843,5.407488986784141

5721170,2,B00CFB6OPM,"Assault on Wall Street is an overall pretty slow and boring film with a main character who isn't very likeable and makes a lot of stupid choices, even before what happens at the end of the film. The action does pick up at the end of the film for maybe the final ten minutes but by then the believability factor is pretty much zero and it's fair to say a lot of viewers would have stopped watching due to boredom or frustration with Dominic Purcell's character failure to stop getting himself deeper and deeper into the hole that he takes no responsibility for being in and hostility towards those who actually offer his advice on how to do so, such as the employee at the bank.

I didn't watch any previews for this film or anything but from the cover image and title of the movie it's pretty obvious there's going to be some sort of armed confrontation on Wall Street, yet the film takes so long to move the storyline along to that part. We could have seen and summed up his life of financial ignorance bliss suddenly crashing down on him, the affect it has on his wife and his daily life in the first fifteen minutes at most. Similar things happened to a lot of people in real life, it wasn't historically that long ago so that film should have condensed the needlessly length drawn out set up and spent most of its time on the actions he decides to take for vengeance.

Spoilers follow about the ending - I was actually disappointed the film went with a pretty brain dead get even ending. I thought the whole point of the boring coffee shop lunch scenes with the two cops and whatever Edward Furlong did was that they would get together and decide to steal from the financial industry crooks, the money for his wife's treatment and maybe get those who had escaped justice to confess their financial crimes while carrying out some sort of clever caper. Obviously Purcell's character wasn't smart enough to come up with a plan, Furlong's seemed a bit mentally challenged too, but the cops and maybe even his wife could have provided the brains and the two armoured car security guards the brawn to pull it off. Even when he was initially targeting specific people who had in his mind been responsible for his financial failures and wife's death (which seemed fairly inconsistent with her character's actions up to then), the film made some sense and you as a viewer could get some satisfaction from it, but when he just starts shooting innocent people in the street, and anyone who looks out their office window, then moves onto anyone inside the building wearing a shirt and tie, what sort of satisfaction as a viewer are you supposed to get from that? Most people killed would have had nothing to do with his loss or anyone else's loss of money, they would have been administration officers, secretaries, there for a job interview, he even kills a security guard, someone who is the same working stiff status as him and his lunch buddy. Change Jim Baxford's motivation from they took my money to people dressed like them drew a cartoon I didn't like, and this character would be labelled a terrorist.

Along the boring path to the ending a lot of stuff makes no sense as well. If he is employed in a job where if his credit rating gets bad he will be dismissed, why on earth would he have obtained a credit card, and if he did, why spend more than has to pay it off each month? Why would he have invested money in some real estate scheme that only pays 7-8% when he had a mortgage and credit card debt in the first place. Credit card for one would have been a higher interest rate than he could have hoped to earn in the scheme. Wouldn't you pay those things off first? Again especially if keeping your job depended so much on not being in financial trouble. Who takes out insurance yet has no idea what the amount of money they will get as a payout will be if you unfortunately have to use it? You know if someone steals your car if you will get enough for a brand new one or half the amount. You decide if you want to pay more in premiums each year to get a bigger payout if the worst happens. Why would you not do the same thing with health insurance? Yet somehow Jim and Rosie believe they will have unlimited money to pay whatever bills arise? As soon as she first got sick you'd be double checking what is covered and the limits, even if you didn't give it much thought when you took out the policy. This just made no sense. Even the places you get treatment would probably bring it up when you filled out any paperwork.

Then you've got him firing an automatic weapon beside the track while a passenger train goes by where the driver at least, if everyone of the passengers was looking at their phones would obviously be able to see him doing so. Once sure maybe he just happened to leave before the cops arrived but he repeatedly returns and does it time and time again. Not to mention the fact housekeeping or anyone else must have never entered his hotel room with the evidence he leaves there each day of his crimes and ultimate plan. What was with the lawyer? He's swaying and bobbing around his chair while he's talking, those scenes with him were just plain weird. Who would hand over $10 000 to someone acting like that?

Now don't get me wrong--Purcell is not the best actor in the world and he certainly won't win any awards for this movie, but he is not bad either and I think did a very respectable and even quite good job in Assault on Wall Street.  Purcell plays a man named Jim whose life goes from ok to terrible. His wife is at the tail end of treatments for brain cancer and his insurance company decides to stop paying after a cap he did not know about is reached. Simultaneous to that, his investment portfolio not only tanks during the 2008 Wall Street crisis, but in an inexplicable turn of events, he now owes the brokerage house $60,000. I can go on and on but don't want to give away the crux of the movie.  The title is self-explanatory--Jim goes on a rampage after being wronged in so many different ways.

I viewed this movie twice: once through fully absorbed and letting my emotions run with it. The second time I actually thought about what was going on and started picking it apart.

If critical thinking is suspended it is a good film as in my first viewing... the dramatic downward spiral really builds up to the satisfying and expected end. But put your thinking cap on and you start to see the holes and contradictions (many pointed out by previous reviewers). The impossibilities in the film and the glorification of the mass murders that occur definitely gave me pause. I think it would have been better had he atleast stuck to people he knew were culpable... but even then alot of the big financial problems he encountered were his own damn fault. The only thing that really bugs me about this movie is that he can be dumb enough to get into a variable rate mortgage without knowing what hes getting into, not understand insurance coverage limits etc.... and yet be so tactical and smart about killing people because of loosing everything. The inconsistency is just maddening and it also points to the reason that no one has done anything like this: anyone smart enough to pull it off weathered the financial crisis just fine. Sure allot of people lost allot of money or had to rent instead of own but very few lost ""everything"" as did the character in this movie.",1388188800,2,1514,4.607407407407408

Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell) is a normal, hard working, family man, until his wife gets sick. Through a series of hardships Jim and his family go bankrupt, leading to an unspeakable act, that causes Jim to lose control. This film had all the makings of a terrific action movie, but that's not what we got. For over an hour, we watch the story of Jim's life slowly pass us by. What should have taken 25 minutes, takes up almost the entirety of the film, it was absolutely ridiculous! We meet Jim and his family, see what the issues are, and then, nothing for quite a while. Prison Break's Dominic Purcell stars in this thing and he is one of the best young action stars they could have gotten to star in this movie. It just really drives me crazy to see how obtuse the writers of these films can be. The lead character was cast, almost to perfection, while at the same time, you have a relatively good story to build upon, yet the film goes nowhere! By the time anything actually happened here, I was already fed up and disinterested. Assault On Wall Street looked like it was going to be a can't miss action/thriller.

I love how Hollywood actors/directors/producer s etc. will be the first to spout off about how evil guns are and how they cause violence but have zero issues with making a movie that glorifies the shooting spree execution of scores of ""evil"" bankers.

This movie is about a regular guy who loses everything and exacts revenge on the Banksters.  Frankly, I'm surprised nothing like this has happened in real life.  If regulators and prosecutors fail to punish the bankers, it most certainly will happen.

He is an armored car driver in New York,obviously subject to a background and criminal record check, but he has an illegal military assault rifle that he took from his military days? (Storage box said US Army or the equivalent on it). Okay, it's possible--not likely.  Let's move on.  He misses a few payments on his mortgage and he's immediately being evicted?  In New York you will be staying between 2-4 years in your home in a foreclosure.  He goes to Eric Roberts the Lawyer, and the lawyer says he has to choose between settlement negotiations and a motion for an injunction in an afternoon? Crap!  In reality you would start the negotiations, and move for injunction later if necessary, you would never have that kind of time pressure. (I have been doing this kind of stuff in NY for 32+ years). On to more interesting stuff.  He shoots up half of New York with both his trusty M4 and handguns, but the cops go after the Wall Street Guy who was pointing a gun at our friendly neighborhood loser, and forget to check said loser?  Let's see, he has a military background--his cop friends know this.  The Wall street guy was only shot holding a pistol in his office.  Do you think maybe some cop might ask, ""Well Gee, who shot all those other people through the building windows?  Where did the hand grenades come from?  Nope, not here.  They merely put a bandage OVER THE SUIT JACKET of our wounded ""hero"" and let him go.  By the way, some people who might have been snipers might opine that shooting a .223 through a heavy glass window might on occasion somewhat deflect the path of the bullet.  Not here.

It ends with a strong message and a dark warning on the tiny minority that owns most of the wealth in our country. Uwe Boll's 'Assault on Wall St' is his latest examination on the roots of violence and rage in American society from a political viewpoint that, IMO, surpasses any other work he's done before including the viscous 'Rampage'. The cast is solid with John Heard, Keith David, Edward Furlong, and Clint Howard all making great appearances. It's slickly directed and packs a wallop as the tension rises higher and higher until the end. I highly recommend this film to anybody who enjoyed 'Rampage' and doubted Boll's talent from his previous mediocre work.",1383436800,,754,4.763358778625954
5721219,5,B00CFB6OPM,"This is another one of Uwe Bolls good movies. Actually Uwe Boll has a lot of good movies but apparently gets every movie he makes a swarm of instant hate because of some corny video game movies he made a while back. These were also video games that were good but not hardly as popular as the whiny bunch of nerds that seems to bring them up would like you to think. BloodRayne,FarCry,Dungeon siege etc. They were a bunch of PC games for nerds that got console releases that did okay. They weren't mega popular games like Resident Evil or Tomb raider so of course they didn't get Hollywood blockbuster budgets or Michael Bay as a director. Stop complaining already!

Uwe Boll has a certain them to his movies where he shoots them from the perspective of the everyday person that puts on their pants one leg at a time. I noticed in the last series of films he released follow the legendary ""RAMPAGE"" (that people are somehow still just finding about) that Uwe Boll really likes to deal with the reality that we all live in. One of his best films that portrays this I'd say is ""Attack on Darfur"" which I'm sure hardly many people have even heard of. That was a heavy film to watch and when I was done I had a new found respect for Uwe Bolls capabilities as a director. I get it that he takes a bigger interests in movies that give him freedom vs. movies that require him to adapt them from someone elses work. I think M.K. Shayamalan is like this also. He is another excellent director that gets flack for making another adaption movie ""Avatar"" and gets hate from folks. M.K. Shayamalan is also another creative mind that like to give you something completely different than what hollywood has been giving you and I see the same things in him as I do in Uwe Boll which is why I enjoy their movies because I can always expect to see something I haven't seen before.

As for Assault on Wall Street it's like I said earlier it's a movie about life. Mr. Average Joe that works hard, pays his mortgage, has a wife, wants a family etc. etc. but falls victim to the Capitalism. Greedy companies,Greedy Banks, Greedy Lawyers, Fair weather Insurance Agencies, A job that cares more about it's image than the well being of its employees. It's basically a movie about how companies and those that benefit from them play with peoples lives. This movie is about the Person that those companies only see as a number and not as a human being. It's about how the decisions of these companies to pull themselves from the fire by throwing other people in it effect the people they just sacrificed.

I'd say this is a movie probably won't mean much to people under the age of 25 because they can't relate to Jim the main character...yet. For people over the age of 25 that have families,careers, a house, investments, retirement funds etc. etc. it's film you can certainly understand.

From the title and DVD cover we know where this is going to go. 10 minutes into the film we know who will die and even know what will trigger Jim to go into the berserker mode.

Jim becomes the envy of every 99%er vigilante, yet a guy we immediately condemn for not having enough self restraint. The problem I had with the film was the sniper mode in which he killed people, with all but one person knowing why they are getting killed. There are no sit the guy in a chair and slowly torture them scenes. It takes an hour before the first person dies, and he is hit by a fast moving taxi.

5721234,1,B00CFB6OPM,"This movie does only one thing well, it represents the twisted, upside-down logic of the liberal left. But before I go there, let's talk about the movie itself.

SLOW and LOW, that is The Tempo. I fell asleep TWICE while watching it. It felt like watching a four hour surveillance video of an empty street. Jeeeeeeezuz! If you are looking for action, keep looking. This crusty ball of horse dung has some shooting, and even a grenade or two exploding, but it is minimal. You'd be better off with OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.

The story takes way to long to get moving. Over an hour is spent just getting to the point that the main player is losing everything. Really? Most Americans have now BEEN THERE DONE THAT so we don't need all the inane details of how it can happen, WE KNOW ALREADY!  Oh, but wait, this was made by Hollywood elites who have never had to deal with these issues, so they are clueless.

The plot is poor because after spending an hour building up to the point, it takes another 40 minutes to get to the action which the main player uses to soothe his pain.

But does it make any sense. Granted, it is a movie, but keep in mind it is also HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDA. That is why there is so much time spent vilifying bankers and bank employees. Remember when Obama did that in 2009? The speech by the head ""bad guy"" at the end is pure, unmitigated propaganda. Jeeeeeeze, at least try to conceal your rhetoric in some kind of believable dialogue.

Sadly, the ""bad guys"" are just ordinary people doing their job. No malice is really ever demonstrated. People who work in businesses are not able to bend the company rules for individuals. That would lead to lawsuits and is bad business.

Of course, the left thinks all business is bad. This movie will appeal to OCCUPY WALL STREET types, skateboarders, and Jew-haters. Yes, BANKER is a racist code-word the left uses for Jew. It is part of the new world Antisemitism.

Oddly missing from the equation in this movie: LAW MAKERS! What role did Chuck Dodd, Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid play in the mortgage crisis? If you don't know the answer, look it up. Google it. YouTube it.

SPOILER ALERT -kinda-  One of my close relatives used to eat fast food three and four times a day. He died at the age of 36, partly because of obesity, partly because of cigarette smoking. What sense would it make for me to go around shooting fry guys and burger flippers, or convenience store clerks to ""get even?""  Right, it wouldn't. So, that the ""hero"" here is some kind of FOR THE PEOPLE marauder of bank tellers and stock brokers is equally UNREASONABLE, LUDICROUS, and STUPID.

5721254,4,B00CFB6OPM,"Well, this is quite interesting. What comes to mind is the lack of homework. Homework is the key to avoiding trouble. But people (financial professionals included) very, very rarely do their homework, or not nearly enough homework.

In this movie after the sauce hit the fan, and the client started asking all the questions he should have asked in the beginning, the broker revealed that he did not actually do the homework himself. He got the information from the sales manger that said it was a ""good deal"".

I wonder did the sales manager actually do the homework.  Who in the chain of command actually took a good look at the deal? Whoever did look at the deal, I wonder if they were even smart enough to know if the deal was good or bad?

To top it off, the customer did not mention anything about what he read in the material, he only talked about what the broker told him. So now we know the customer did no homework himself. We also know the broker did not do any homework by his own admission. The sales manager maybe or maybe not did some last minute homework before they gave the deal to the brokers to push to the customer.

So there you have it. That is the problem. No one has the energy to do the homework when it is time. But look what happens when things go bad. Very sad situations can quickly develop.

The more eyes on the wheel the better. In this 2008 scenario the bottom line is no one was really paying attention. At least not enough people were paying attention.

But look at all the madness and negative energy that gets exerted when things do go bad.

Everyone in this scenario wished they took more time and care in how they handled the situations when it was happening. The brokers, lawyers, sales managers, and above all the customer paid a dear price that did not have to be paid. We as professionals need to take a little more time care and attention.

Yet it is odd to see towards the end of the movie the main character had actually read and understood some things. That is very sad, because that means if he took time in the beginning to understand what he was really getting into he may have avoided the bad mortgage and investment deal all together.

If he was smart enough to figure out at the end what was happening, why could he have not read, studied, and ask questions in the beginning before the trouble?

He was obviously smart enough. When you actually read your prospectus it explains all the things that can go wrong. Problem is many people very rarely read this very important document.

The bad mortgage deal. The same applies. When it says ""adjustable"" you need be able to handle the worse case scenario payment. You need to know what the worse case scenario can be. You have to read and ask questions. Never let anyone push you to hurry up and sign some papers or write a check. Again, who reads the mortgage or the note and ask questions?

But those same people end up spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars paying for the fact they did not use an ounce of prevention, because they did want to read about 40 pages or so at the closing table. Perhaps then they would know be afraid and cautious and seriously ask themselves and the guy across the table what is really going on.

When we were in school as children there were penalties for not doing our homework. In real adult life this rule applies more so.

It makes no sense to be tough enough to be a vigilante but not tough enough to overcome your laziness and do the homework when it is time.

Ask the tough questions when it is time. Stand up for your self when it is time. And that time is before the check is written and the papers are signed.

5721259,4,B00CFB6OPM,"It's difficult to rate this film because it is not only a movie but a realistic analysis of how Wall Street criminals made billions and trillions cheating the average middle class family. Purcell and Karpluk play the role of a married middle class couple who experience insufferable hardship and pain as their modest financial status quickly takes a severe dive due to the manipulations on Wall Street. This first half of the movie can well be classified as pure drama as the plot concentrates on their suffering. The pace here is slow and the acting is mediocre, but salvaged somewhat by the more colorful characters played by Keith David and Edward Furlong. But the second half, as the title aptly states, is more ""I'll Take My Revenge"" type with Purcell finally coming alive in the macho role he excels at. Special mention goes to John Heard who does a great acting job as an unrepentant Wall Street Big. In my opinion the greatest value of this film is the presentation of facts over how Wall Street, the Big Banks, and the elite class in America suck the blood of working-class people, making trillions of dollars in the process. That the US Government used tax-payer money to bail out these worthless elite criminals is enough to make any regular citizen rejoice when Dominic Purcell, as the husband who has lost everything, goes on a rampage to extract revenge against the high-profile Wall Street vampires.

Their story follows all twelve steps progressively more serious tragic events from health insurance caps, registered letter notices unanswered calls to brokers and lawyers to suicide, a severance envelope to a chance meeting outside a bar where a man dies starting part two of the movie.
The movie is well cast with the usual good guys and villains. Edward Furlong is the near impotent with n'er do well who is well done in his sincere friendship. His two lunch buddy cop friends Pare and David also convince in their sincerity. Eric Roberts is the expensive lawyer who promises much for a price but isn't enough. The sleazy fund brokers are right now almost too easy a portrayal.

Its a study of a man driven to the breaking point. The cliche that crime does not pay, and love and friendship triumphs here becomes rather deftly served.

For instance they wanted to portray that the main star was thinking about going postal, so they show us the star by the river side just gazing, then cut the scene to show star in the park gazing and this multi-gazing scenes continues for 4 minutes.

5721267,5,B00CFB6OPM,"Our society is feeling a high degree of impotence these days, as we see how the people responsible for the economic crisis, mostly the bandits at Wall Street, have gotten away with murder. Many people have learned the meaning of the word suffering because of them. I'm sure that you know one. Although some films have been released explaining the origins and some of the tragic results, none - I believe - will give you well-deserved personal satisfaction and a dose of happiness as in the gripping and electrifying ""Assault on Wall Street.""

The movie begins, precisely, in the office of Jeremy Stancroft (John Heard), head of a Wall Street investment firm. Things are not going well, and they are on the verge of loosing everything due to greed. He advises two of his lieutenants to order the staff to commit further malpractices so that he could save his tail. When the assistants complain, he tells them, ""The problem is saving the company, not the clients. Our responsibility begins and ends with our partners and shareholders, and that's it!"" We then meet Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell), a regular guy trying to make ends meet. He works as a security guard in an armored truck, his partner being Sean (Edward Furlong). His regular day includes having lunch with Sean, and police officer buddies Freddy (Keith David) and Frank (Michael Par). Most importantly, he is happily married to Rosie (Erin Karpluk), and it is his wish to have children in their future. Sadly, Rosie gets sick and needs expensive treatment, which Jim provides with his insurance. He also counts on some money being handled by the wizards at Wall Street. When his wife's medical bills begin to pile up, and he tries to access his investment money, he is told that the money is gone. These conditions ignite a sad chain of events in Jim's life that affect his happy marriage with damaging results. With nothing to loose, he decides to take action. And, boy, did he take action!

""Assault on Wall Street,"" which original name was ""Bailout: The Age of Greed,"" builds up slowly and director Uwe Boll makes sure that you feel every step. You witness how Jim's life begins to slowly disintegrate and how he is pushed against the wall - his pain is yours. And the end is as smart as you can get, incredibly well-thought and opens the possibility for a sequel. The only negative thing, I believe, is the amount of time that Jim is shown thinking his actions when alone. But that, I guess, is part of the build-up that takes us to a satisfying conclusion. And, along the way, we'll learn that ""it's the free trade, my friend. It's capitalism. That's competition in a capitalist society. It's why the cream always rises to the top. That's how the strong survives, and the weak dies off."" (Canada, 2013, color, 97 min)
