8047934,5,B0007L7IPM,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the lawyer is a detective and the solution occurs in a courtroom. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers by mentioning new technology or medico-legal facts; they often warned of scams and swindles. A real life trial is not as dramatic as these stories. The prices date these stories, as do the vehicles. The monetary figures from the 1950s are far out of date; multiply by ten (or more) for today's figures. Gardner was a founder of ""The Court of Last Resort"" that worked to reverse unjust convictions. These TV stories are the simplified and condensed versions of the original novel; the stories and names of the characters could be changed. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s.

""The Half-Wakened Wife"" begins when Mrs. Marian Shelby is lounging outside a large suburban house. The handyman offers her a drink. Mr. Scott Shelby sees them, goes inside to load a shotgun, places it in a golf bag, then leaves. An angry investor visits Mr. Shelby's office to demand his money. Perry Mason gets a telegram from Frank Lawton asking Perry to defend him. Mr. Shelby calls Frank and asks him to bring a shotgun. The police are called after Scott Shelby disappeared because of his business problems. But Shelby's body was found. Perry notices a problem with some photographs. Questions bring out the facts that free Perry's client.

""The Case of the Rolling Bones"" starts when a woman presents a check at a bank. The banker calls for authorization and gets it. Mr. Dave Kemp tells about this scheme. They put Mr. Reed into a sanitarium. Reed's girlfriend, Miss Milly Foster,  calls Perry Mason to get him out. The scene where the Doctor is cross-examined is very clever and entertaining. Daniel Reed is ordered released, but he has escaped! Maury Lewis is found dead and Reed is the suspect. There is a colorful story about Daniel Reed in the gold fields of Alaska. How did the police learn what Perry Mason would do? One witness testifies; is he too accurate? A witness is recalled by D.A. Burger, then Perry examines him and gets an admission that frees Perry's client. [This story has a lot of subtle humor.]",1200528000,,2258,4.7698209718670075
