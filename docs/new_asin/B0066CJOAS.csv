4962008,5,B0066CJOAS,"lots of great techniques and skills demonstrated, mostly painting / weathering techniques and design thought process stuff.  kit bashing, some sculpting, vacuum-forming, moldmaking, plastic degassing and pouring, some introduction to materials, simple LED wiring, well reccommended.",1393891200,,282,6.833333333333333
4962009,5,B0066CJOAS,"if your a beginner or advanced modeler like me, this will give you some great tips you might not know :)  the best $30 bucks i spent all year :)",1378339200,,144,3.8
4962010,5,B0066CJOAS,"This is a fantastic video! Extremely in depth. Occasionally he skips a step, and it gets confusing. But then he covers it in another chapter. This is a great start to finish video that every beginning model maker show own!",1360454400,,222,4.575
4962011,5,B0066CJOAS,"This is the best video to give the modeler a head start into this world.  I find it ironic that the very things I thought of as a boy, they do today.  The tricks of how it was done was never available to prospective artist but, now it can be shared to advance the art form.  I'm grateful to Fon Davis for sharing his techniques and have only a couple regrets.  One, he didn't name a couple tools proper names along with the companies to buy them from and most importantly............another DVD to show even more. We need more instructional DVD's of this caliber.  This is a very good buy. I thank Fon Davis for his kindness in sharing these details and secrets that most people would never know.  He IS instrumental in inspiring future artist. See for yourself and then give him a ""Thanks"".  I bet he'll appreciate it and maybe it will inspire other artist to share their secrets too.",1359763200,,885,4.425925925925926
4962012,5,B0066CJOAS,"As a retired professional modelmaker, I just thought I would add this DVD to my reference library for others to borrow.  When I had time to go through the whole DVD, I was impressed with Fon's presentation of the information.  Great video coverage and a full disclosure of many of the solutions he uses to come up with a great presentation model.  I am greatly impressed with his knowledge and willingness to share with others and look forward to his next presentation.",1352937600,6,469,4.695121951219512
4962013,5,B0066CJOAS,"If only something like this had existed when I was first starting out in the business...

The author is able to condense years of experience into well-organized, easy-to-follow segments. He knows exactly when to streamline for clarity, and also when close-ups and more detailed directions are called for. The planning and effort invested in this production are obvious. There is a huge amount of the right kind of information here. Even if you think you already know all this stuff, you will benefit from this well-thought out DVD.
Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next installment!",1332633600,6,588,5.125
4962014,5,B0066CJOAS,"I got this DVD set and its awesome. The author custom designed a project from scratch that goes through all the steps I was curious about, especially the process of vacuum forming and creating custom molds. He explains and shows each step clearly in detail so I wasn't left wondering. You can totally get it done with this instructional video.",1323043200,6,343,4.733333333333333
8493846,5,B0066CJOAS,Very good experience,1510358400,,20,6.0
8493847,5,B0066CJOAS,"I purchased my copy directly from Fon at an IPMS event in Santa Rosa, CA. He was with other ILM alumni whom were speaking and he had his recognizable model work on display.  Fon is incredibly talented, & good-hearted. In this video he is teaching film industry-level model making concepts that would normally take years to learn as an apprentice. These concepts would be invaluable to modelmakers, makers, rapid prototypers, etc.",1479772800,,429,5.042253521126761
8493848,5,B0066CJOAS,Actually I purchased it for my son who teaches Intro. to Engineering to advanced students in high school. He says it is something he plans to use with his students in connection with instruction in the use of the CAD.......drawing the model on the CAD and then reproducing it in real time.,1453852800,,289,4.576923076923077
8493849,5,B0066CJOAS,If you are in to any type of model building you will love this video. Tons of information and well thought out. Glad something like this is available.,1440979200,,150,4.392857142857143
8493850,4,B0066CJOAS,"A step by step tour as a model is built. The real payoff is in the painting techniques. Informative and entertaining, even if you never build a model.",1428364800,,150,4.392857142857143
8493851,5,B0066CJOAS,"Great video.  While the tools and techniques are very advanced, it's great fun to  watch this process.  There are definitely useful tips and tricks even for the novice builder. Highly recommended!",1415318400,,196,5.258064516129032
8493852,5,B0066CJOAS,"I am an experienced model builder and already familiar with several of the techniques (molding, casting, vacuum forming, etc.) presented, but for each of the techniques I thought I knew, I learned something additional. I have seen Fon speak in person, and he plays so well off his audience, I was afraid his presentation in front of a camera might suffer from a lack of feedback. My concern was completely unfounded. He is as engaging on camera as he is in person, which lets the viewer focus on the information presented without being distracted by a wooden presentation. Very professional production values and great information.",1409702400,3,631,5.019047619047619
8493853,4,B0066CJOAS,"This guy is pretty amazing with just taking a vague idea and scratch building a model from, essentially a napkin drawing. There are areas that kind of drag on in the video but, there is a lot of good information on tricks and techniques such as shading, weathering, painting and using the spare parts box. However, unless you have the big vacuum form machine like he does it would be a little difficult to do your own scratch build like he does. What would be nice is if there was a companion DVD showing how to build some of the equipment or where to buy something affordable so the average modeler could be able to create objects in a similar fashion. There are vacuum form machines out there but, they are for light weight stuff not the heavier stuff he forms his models from.",1408320000,4,779,4.416666666666667
8493854,5,B0066CJOAS,"I hesitated to buy this at first - only because I'd bought similar DVD's and have gotten burned. This one does not disappoint. The video is very informative and does not skip on detail. The process is all there and the artist explains the ""Why's"" of the craft making process. He also offers different solutions and ideas. The piece on the cover is a little vague - but it looks really good in the video. This artist has now been doing more work which might explain why this is the only volume - BUT I HOPE HE MAKES MORE!!! Get to it guys! :)",1403049600,3,541,4.211538461538462
8493855,5,B0066CJOAS,Terrific gift.  Could not have bought a better modeling item.  My son is still thanking me for this item.  Would like for me to find some more from same maker.,1396742400,,159,4.233333333333333
