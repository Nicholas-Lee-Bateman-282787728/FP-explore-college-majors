4126038,1,B003HTPHUE,"I was watching a bit of this show and then lost interest the moment that he compared the holocaust to the titanic. Its shameful for a grown man this day in age to be so ignorant when he is standing there up against the american flag and can say to the american audience watching that they shouldnt make another holocaust film after shindlers list cause its already been done its like doing another titanic film. Sorry to enlighten you Mr. Byrne but if you had done your homework, and looked up what you were creating 'jokes about' you would see that this is not material for a stand up act, and in your case you are classless. The holocaust saw over 8 million men women and children and even babies, MURDERED. there is more than one story to be told in this atrocity. Shame on you for having this sick mind set and for mocking those lives lost. its people like you that I'm scared will look away when more innocence are brutally robbed of their lives because of prejudice and injustice. I wonder if you would have even bothered to stand up to it if you were born in that era.",1280275200,2,1075,4.326732673267327
4126039,4,B003HTPHUE,"Based on the comedy ONLY, I would give this a 3.5/5, but I give it a 4 cause the COMPLETELY agree with most of the jokes. There's one joke about African-Americans & Asian-Americans that I love, AND agree with totally.

I've always liked Steve Byrne though. I think my fav thing with him that I've seen is a YouTube video. I think he was in the Comedy Factory. That was hilarious!! You'll know it's the one when he makes the joke about ""Spooning"" with women.",1297641600,,457,4.376470588235295
4126040,5,B003HTPHUE,"I'm just going to come right out and say it: I'm cheap. I will stalk ebay so I can buy a movie for a dollar. I will rummage through boxes at yard sales and haggle to get ten dvds for the price of a cheeseburger. I will slip movies into my purse at the homes of my friends and return them a week later. I have never paid full price for a dvd...

Until now.

I've seen Steve live a couple times and he has always put on an incredible show (at one of them, I even got to be part of the act. For those who have purchased the dvd, I got to be the lucky lady for the last part. For those who haven't, well... now you have to buy it to get in on the secret. Trust me, it's hilarious). After I caught part of his special on Comedy Central, I knew my purchase would be well worth it. There's some hilarious stuff that didn't make it onto TV, so if you're on the fence about buying this: fear not, it is worth every penny.

Steve is observant, intelligent, and witty. This is especially showcased on this DVD. He takes some of today's relevant issues and puts a comedic spin on them, making the material on this DVD something a good humored audience can identify with.

Buy the dvd. You won't regret it!",1285459200,2,1193,4.0423728813559325
4126041,5,B003HTPHUE,"Buy this dvd only if you truly love great comedy done by a well spoken & slightly twisted person! Awesome follow up to ""Happy Hour"" Well done Mr. Byrne!",1281312000,2,152,4.275862068965517
4126042,5,B003HTPHUE,"I couldn't wait to purchase this DVD and watch Steve Byrne's performances. His jokes are so funny ! He had me smiling and laughing the whole time! Some of his jokes, I can related with him but most of all, he is able to convey his jokes without offending people. If you understand his type of humors but find them offensive then these jokes is lost on you! I've been following his career since watching him on another DVD ""Kims of Comedy"". Keep up the good work, Steve!  I hope there will be many more performances from you! It is a pleasure to watch you perform...  You are  my favorite Comedian!",1280793600,,597,4.36036036036036
4126043,5,B003HTPHUE,"So excited my DVD came in the mail today! My teenage boys and I just finished watching it, laughing even more than we did when it aired on TV. For anyone with a real sense of humor (obviously this does not include Semtex Girl) this is first-class comedy performed by someone who understands better than most what it means to deal with ignorance and stereotyping in day-to-day life. An instant classic! My kids and I love it! Thanks, Steve!",1280534400,,439,4.569620253164557
4126044,5,B003HTPHUE,"AS always Steve Byrne delivers!, full of laughs and wonderful humor from the best of the best...I sooo can't wait for more!",1280448000,,123,4.636363636363637
4126045,5,B003HTPHUE,"By far my favorite work from steve byrne.  My fourth live show of his that i've seen and the man never ceases to amaze.  sadly, sometimes his comedy is too intellectual for ""semtex girl""- i mean SOME people, but at least i got all his jokes!  honestly, comedy central didn't do it justice by cutting the show to one hour.  can't wait to see him live again or for another special!  mr. byrne, i continue to applaud you!  steve byrne jjang!",1280448000,,438,4.345679012345679
4126046,5,B003HTPHUE,"I've been waiting for this special for such a long time, as a fan of Steve Byrne since his first Comedy Central Presents I can definitely say that I love where he takes his comedy. Every time I have caught his act live or on Television he gets better and better. This blu-ray/dvd is packed with tons of great jokes mostly all new if you have never seen him live recently. But if you have maybe some will say ohhhh I've seen these jokes before or similiar, but see that's the beauty of Mr. Byrne, he's like a rockstar magician in that you want him to perform his best, surprise us with new jokes and throw some good old classics at you, some with neat twists. The Byrne Identity is a great non-stop joy to watch and even has some neat little special features. Steve thanks for the wonderful special and I look forward to your next endeavors.

If you are a fan of Steve this special has your name written all over it! If you are new to him you cannot go wrong with any of his specials.

Can't believe you called me up TWICE to do that with you haha",1280448000,,1137,4.2304147465437785
4126047,5,B003HTPHUE,"You know you are a good comedian when someone will see your material more than once and still laugh each time.  Steve does that for me, and he definitely doesn't disappoint in his new special ""The Byrne Identity.""  Steve is completely original and relatable, which is the best combination in any comedian.  I love it when Steve goes into his ""girl"" voice..get's me to bust a gut every time.  I got this DVD because Comedy Central bleeped so much out, and also for the great extras.  What are you waiting for..order it already!",1280448000,,526,4.612903225806452
4126048,5,B003HTPHUE,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD special!  I'm confused at the review with a single star?!  Come on now, lighten up, GEEZ!!!  You watch stand up to unwind and laugh about life.  He's definitely become my new favorite comedian.",1280361600,3,220,4.7105263157894735

8397218,5,B003HTPHUE,I had seen it on Comedy Central and the dvd was even better. I can't and won't say anything bad about it. I would recommend The Byrne Identity to anyone and everyone.,1401494400,,166,4.21875
8397219,5,B003HTPHUE,"I picked up The Byrne Identity after seeing Byrne's earlier Comedy Central special, and I was not disappointed. He tackles many great social issues without going overboard with swearing. There is some graphic details, but you end up laughing enough to cover it up. A great stand-up set from the guy behind Sullivan & Son.",1399507200,2,321,4.8545454545454545
8397220,5,B003HTPHUE,"Steve Byrne is an incredible comedian. Not many comedians can keep me rolling on the floor laughing, but he manages to do it for me.",1374278400,,132,4.32
8397221,5,B003HTPHUE,"3rd DVD with Steve Byrne.  1st-Kims of Comedy where he was excellent.  2nd was Happy Hour which was mostly recycled material from Kims of Comedy but not executed well but still ok.  This Stand Up is done really well where I thought the material was much longer than an hours (in a very good way).  Some other stand up seems to be wasting time to fill time but Byrne filled this DVD well that it was moving very smoothly and have so many material that it seemed to be longer in comparison to other stand up...once again in a good, entertaining way.",1361059200,,547,4.333333333333333
8397222,3,B003HTPHUE,"I've never met Steve Byrne, but from what I've seen of him, he comes across as a genuinely nice guy.  In my book, that's worth a lot of points.  Steve's WTF Podcast interview alone was additional fuel for me to keep rooting for his success.  Steve has spoken about how he wanted to step away from the frenetic physical comedy that he did in his previous special in deference to doing more spoken material, and The Byrne Identity definitely has that.  There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, but this special does not meet its full potential.  The risks that Byrne takes are misplaced in jokes about racial stereotypes, which produces a shocked response at times, but even these risks are somewhat safe, as this kind of ground is well-tread.  A lot of the material is safe and therefore comes across as pandering, as if the comedian was thinking, ""this sounds like something they'll laugh at,"" rather than material that gives the viewer an idea of what the Byrne Identity actually is.  Also, there were places during the show where Steve's timing is rushed, and rather than building tension in the audience (letting them out and then reeeeeling them back in), he rushes to the punch line, giving him the appearance of being overeager for the laugh.

However, where Steve gets personal with his material and the timing isn't rushed, (So as not to give punch lines away, The iTunes bit and the Chinatown bit were great)it works very well and is very funny.  Steve has great tags, is visually entertaining to watch, and knows when to escalate a punch line.  The Byrne Identity is funny and shows Steve's evolution as a comic.  However, beyond being half Korean and half Irish, I'm still not 100% sure yet just who Steve Byrne is.  I look forward to his next special and wish him all of the success in the world.",1323907200,3,1811,4.625
8397223,5,B003HTPHUE,"I just watched this and I have to say, it's been a really long time since I laughed that hard! From the beginning Steve Byrne is engaging and funny but once he gets rolling...IN TEARS! I pulled a muscle in my side from laughing so hard, I woke nearly all of my neighbours and it's like 3am so bad me but holy crap he is HILARIOUS! Payday later in the week and I am soooo buying this! Absolutely brilliant!!",1315180800,,406,4.151898734177215
