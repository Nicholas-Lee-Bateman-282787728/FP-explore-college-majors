Make one where the evil cats are defeated, and not able to get him anymore, so that Puss n Boots win.",1409961600,,255,4.019607843137255
8113804,1,B000ES10G6,"I loved this cartoon when i was little and was hoping to get it on DVD. I saw it new on Amazon and bought it. when i got it i the mail i put it in and it skipped around in the beginning, so i returned it and the seller was very rude to me. i bought another new one from a different seller. I put it in and it did the same thing, it skipped around in the beginning. i guess its not meant for me to have.",1340064000,,402,3.5280898876404496
8113805,5,B000ES10G6,Borrowed this movie from the library when my son was 8 or 9yrs old. It was really good even to me. Watching this crazy cat travel around the world and the people he would run into. I still like it but my son wanted a copy of it at 21yrs old. Now he has his own copy. We can watch it together.,1336780800,,292,3.725806451612903
8113806,5,B000ES10G6,"Ok sooo my brother and I used to watch this move some 23 years ago almost every weekend at a community rec center.  By sheer chance the idea of this movie popped into my head and after a short search I am glad to have found this copy.  Do NOT be alarmed by the cover art- as others have said, it has nothing to do with the movie.  The film is Japanese animation from the 70's and as can be seen by the classic style.

 Also let me say this- the first 2 minutes the video tracking and sound are screwy... BUT this is from the master copy as my brother and I CLEARLY remember the VHS tape doing the same crap back in 1987-88.  The rest of the movie is pristine and what is missing at the beginning is not needed to enjoy the rest of the film.

 I bought this so that my niece and nephew could see a fun cartoon and at the same time allow myself a nice walk down memory lane.  Well worth the minimal coin I had to shell out.",1306886400,,921,3.9086021505376345
8113807,5,B000ES10G6,"I could not believe the quality of this VHS! This a very hard to find item, a movie from the late 70s, early Japanese animation. If you buy this movie then you have to get the original ""Puss'n boots"" and the second ""The return of Pero"" by Hayao Miyazaki.
Hats off for the seller!",1287705600,,279,4.185185185185185
8113808,4,B000ES10G6,"Beware, the first minute and 50 seconds of the video is absolutely unwatchable.  After nearly 2 minutes, the video and audio steady out to a decent VHS quality.  I don't think it could have been helped, it looks like the VHS that this was converted from was just bad in the first 2 minutes.

Movie is the same one I watched as a child, although the DVD slim case cover art is a custom job that doesn't particularly look like the actual cartoon.  So don't worry when you get this and the cover art doesn't look anything like what you expect.

Great movie, Decent quality DVD after the first 2 minutes.[...]",1262995200,,605,4.414414414414415
