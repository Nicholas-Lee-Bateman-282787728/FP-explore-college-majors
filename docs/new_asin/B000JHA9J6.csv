2670570,2,B000JHA9J6,"i watched this movie through netflix's online streaming capabilities several months ago.  i absolutely fell in love with Lisa Hannigan's music because of this movie.  the movie itself is worth a watch especially if you're into pop music.  i'm not much of a pop fan myself and watched mostly because i respect Herbie Hancock as a jazz pianist.  it really pretty neat to see modern musicians take on some of these songs and use their talents in a different genre.  the movie itself i would give 4 stars.  my problem with this set is that the CD that comes with it isn't the Possibilities CD.  it's only a rough mix of 4 songs.  the price when i bought it was pretty cheap and my thought process going in was, ""i'll pay this much just to have a CD quality version of Billie Holiday's 'Don't Explain' (performed by Herbie Hancock, Damien Rice, and Lisa Hannigan.) and the DVD will be a bonus.""  but the CD doesn't have the song and i don't really want to buy the Possibilities CD for one song.  i didn't pay that much and so i don't really feel like i was ripped off, but to advertise this set as ""Herbie Hancock: Possibilities DVD/CD"" is very misleading.  thus 2 stars.",1314835200,22,1166,4.427230046948357

2670573,5,B000JHA9J6,Herbie Hancock holds his own in any gnere and in any group aas exemplified by this offering in which he pairs with performers not usually in my musical realm.  Very enjoyable!,1397520000,,175,4.645161290322581
2670574,4,B000JHA9J6,Great CD with many talented musiciaostns. Hancock is brilliant . Recorded bi- coastal and a very nice peek at what Raul Midon can do.,1387238400,,133,4.583333333333333
2670575,5,B000JHA9J6,I got the CD/DVD combo for my husband for his birthday. He says Herbie Hancock is his favorite keyboardist and that he just wishes the Individual collaborations would have lasted longer.,1376265600,,186,5.032258064516129

2670577,5,B000JHA9J6,"Mr. Hancock organizes great music with great talented musicians.
This is one of them.

I enjoyed Raul Midon Live at Billboard Live Osaka in 2012.
His live performance in Osaka was excellent so I bought this CD.

2670579,2,B000JHA9J6,"If you want to buy this DVD/CD expecting you will receive Hancock's ""Possibilities"" album, you will not. The CD contains only 4 songs, and the DVD is a sort of documentary film about how the album was recorded. The DVD itself might be considered interesting if you are a huge jazz fan, but be aware that this is not the full album.",1332720000,14,331,4.354838709677419
2670580,3,B000JHA9J6,"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, so make sure you do.  That said, the 4 song bonus outakes CD is very good!  Herbie shines a bit more there.",1329004800,,164,4.433333333333334

8150327,5,B000JHA9J6,"Not for everyone but any serious musician should see this DVD, it  has some great live studio video of the artist's and Herbie's magic fingers and great arrangements and the way he is so open minded that he can bring the best of rock, blues, funk,  even folk into his eclectic mix.
My Favourites:  ""When love comes to town"", Hush,Hush,Hush (heartbreaking) , Don't Explain,  Stitch Me Up
The Music CD is superb as it has the finished versions of the songs,
Just watching these top notch studio musicians create the magic is a gift most people never get to see, especially Steve Jordan the best live and studio drummer around  IMHO, rock, jazz, folk, funk, fusion he just nails it 100%,
Wonder why your band just doesn't sound tight, it's probably your drummer who became a drummer because he has absolutely no musical talent. at all. All the really good drummers are also great all around musicians most of them can play pretty good piano, guitar or sing like a bird.",1443484800,2,966,4.625730994152047
