For anyone and everyone that needs to relieve stress and get some movement into their day.",1487721600,,256,4.354166666666667
8294960,4,B001DTWNQ6,"I've been bedridden since mid-November.  I'm only 39.  I noticed muscle atrophy in my arms and shoulders a few weeks ago.  I bought this DVD to help prevent more atrophy.  I like the instructor and the light workout.  I just started, so it's enough for me now.  I do wish there were more leg exercises.  The instructor does these exercises in bed, and I do them on the floor, because it's more conveinent for me.  I don't understand the reviews previous to mine, that say these must be done in a chair.  Frankly, I tried them in a chair, and it wasn't possible.  At least not for me.  So these exercises are truly for bedridden patients.  I would have given this DVD 5 stars had it had more leg exercises.",1454544000,5,705,4.338461538461538
8294961,3,B001DTWNQ6,"Great for wheelchair users, less appropriate for bedridden users who need to be kept on their backs. I had high hopes for this one, but I am able to do it on my stronger days. The instructor is very motivating.",1439683200,5,210,4.275
8294962,5,B001DTWNQ6,"We bought this for our friend who has lost both legs to diabetes. She is quite overweight, and this is perfect for her. Not too strenuous, and it gets her moving.",1374883200,5,162,4.258064516129032

8294964,5,B001DTWNQ6,Chair Aerobics for Everyone - Exercises for the Bedridden is an excellent DVD for less mobile people.  I use it regularly.,1352592000,9,122,4.809523809523809
8294965,5,B001DTWNQ6,"I am in my 30s and recovering from a severe foot injury that requires me to be non-weight-bearing for 6 months. Obviously, I spend a lot of time sitting around so I decided to try this workout to help with my breathing, circulation and strength.

The exercises in this video are divided into short segments. These include warm up, light workout or strenuous workout, then cool down and meditation (relaxation). The light workout focuses on breathing, stretching and some simple arm exercises using gravity as resistance. In the the strenuous workout (which I found beneficial, but not necessarily strenuous) the arm exercises are done with small hand weights and a core workout is added (torso twists and seated crunches). I chose to add some leg and ankle exercises given to me by my doctor before moving on to the cool down, as there are not many leg exercises on the video.

I liked the instructor, as well. He has a friendly demeanor and a soothing voice. He encourages modifications for those who cannot complete the exercises as shown, and I'm sure that anyone can use common sense-based modifications to make these basic exercises work for them.

I would recommend this video to anyone who is bedridden or non-weight-bearing and looking for a way to get moving and increase circulation. The emphasis on deep breathing is also an invaluable tool for the physically challenged or those wanting to ease into exercise. Glad I gave it a try.",1303084800,24,1443,4.857723577235772
8294966,5,B001DTWNQ6,"I bought this DVD because I wanted something very low-key to get back into exercising.  I have issues with migraines and fatigue and I can't stand getting overheated, so I wanted a program that was more about building flexibility and strength, rather than jumping around while some hyperactive, bony person shrieks at you.  I wanted an exercise DVD that I wouldn't dread.  I really love this DVD.  There are two workouts, one that is easier and shorter, and one that includes cardio and weights.  The longer workout is about 30 minutes.  Both include warm up and cool down sessions as well as a meditation session at the end.  The production values are pretty low budget but everything, including the music, is perfectly adequate as far as I'm concerned.  The instructor, David Stamps, could not be better.  He is pleasant, clear, and encouraging.  His voice is soothing and his explanations are easy to understand.  There is absolutely no inane chit chat a la Leslie Sansone.  The meditation session is so relaxing that more than once, I have fallen asleep before the end of it (I am on my bed, after all)!

This DVD is marketed as being for people who are bedridden and/or physically challenged.  I'm not an authority on those issues so I don't know how suitable it would be for people with different physical issues.  I do think this DVD could be good for people who haven't exercised in a long time, or who have a lot of weight to lose and need to start off slowly, or actually anyone who wants a low-key strength-building workout that you can do on your own bed.  I would recommend that you get a bed rest, the kind of pillow with arms for sitting up in bed, so that you have enough support for your back.

I really like this workout and I plan on getting the chair aerobics DVDs with this same instructor.",1293753600,31,1811,4.574534161490683
