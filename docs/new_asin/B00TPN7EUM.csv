7015367,5,B00TPN7EUM,"FINALLY ... I have been waiting years for One Foot ..... to be released. The acting, the script, the production are top-notch. The true story of a man who gives up his medical studies to answer ""the call"" to enter the Methodist ministry. Frederic March is outstanding in the lead roll of a father and minister who tries to balance the duties of his ministry with his roll of husband and father. His long suffering wife consoles him and supports him as he brings comfort to his ""flock"" while fighting the internal politics of his church's elders. Don't miss getting this for your movie collection while it's still available. I'm buying a second copy in case I wear this copy out.",1432944000,3,678,4.6115702479338845
7015368,5,B00TPN7EUM,"I had watched this movie a couple times on TCM and loved it. This is a very heart warming and inspirational movie. If you love old movies and the throw back to simple times and virtues, this one is for you. I could not find it anywhere on DVD. One day I got an email to purchase movies on Amazon and thought I would try one more time and sure enough it was there. I am very happy to have it as part of my collection and am always pleased with Amazon. I get my product quickly and at a great price.",1431820800,2,497,3.8823529411764706

7015371,5,B00TPN7EUM,"This is now my all time favorite movie...EVER!  I am so glad someone finally made this available. I've been looking for it ever since I watched it on TCM years ago...I love everything about this movie- the setting, the characters, the theme and especially the ending, which caught me totally by surprise. The movie is about family and about serving God in, and out the church, and all the hardships and injustices that accompanied that life.  It chronicles the lives of a pastor and his family back when pastors made very little money - a sharp contrast to today's standards. I love Frederick March and Martha Scott (who are both by the way the epitome of a good husband and wife) It is so nice to be able to watch and remember back to how things used to be - people had respect and compassion for one another even in the most difficult of times. I have watched this movie 5 times since I got last month and every time I cry at the end - not because it's sad, but because it's so true....so very very true, and so sad that this is no longer the way things are. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. One Foot in Heaven is an absolutely beautiful story of family, and love....and hope.",1430870400,6,1192,4.364864864864865
7015372,5,B00TPN7EUM,Great old movie with good moral values when church was central to the family.,1430611200,,77,4.571428571428571
7015373,5,B00TPN7EUM,"I agree with the other fine reviews of ""One Foot in a Heaven,"" and at first felt there was little to add that had already not been said. However, I like this picture so much I decided to add my voice to the approving chorus in hopes that it will perhaps further entice potential viewers to give this film a chance.
  I am happy ""One Foot in Heaven"" is finally on dvd thanks to the Warner Archive Collection. It is long overdue. It is a unique film.
  As another reviewer noted, Frederic March and the entire cast are wonderful. In particular, Martha Scott, Beulah Bondi, Gene Lockhart, and Moroni Olsen are exceptional as usual. The acting is superb in even the smallest roles.
  The Methodist ministry was and still is itinerant, which means that ministers and their families relocate many times during their careers. This of course presents many challenges, including differing housing challenges, new schools, and vastly different congregations. A minister must be a pastor, an administrator, and a preacher. The toughest battles are often within the congregations themselves, and the clergy often face considerable resistance from the pews of their own churches.
  The film is based on a memoir by a minister's son, and is told from the perspective of the pastor and his family. The parishioners are often portrayed as people who have their own power bases and agendas within the church. Anyone-clergy or laity-who has been involved in church work knows this reality. The Methodist church in particular has a long tradition of lay leadership and involvement that comes from its frontier traditions. And In fairness it must be said that there are not a few ministers who also have their own agendas which sometimes are more about their own egos than the good of the church. These problems must be worked out with each congregation, and the infighting can be very acrimonious. More than one layperson and even minister have lost their faith this way.
  Therefore the final scene with March at the carillon is particularly moving and healing. As the notes of ""The Churches One Foundation"" ring out across the town, March's face reveals all of the struggle, hurt, and sacrifice he and his family have endured- And most importantly, all the love that somehow remains in his heart. It is truly redemptive in every sense of the word.
  I would recommend the film to everyone:  Believers and unbelievers, as well as the churched and unchurched. It is a moving and beautiful movie.",1430006400,6,2476,4.880668257756564
7015374,5,B00TPN7EUM,"This has always been my favorite movie!  It would be shown around Easter each year.  But, it hasn't been shown for several years.  I was thrilled to discover that it has come out on DVD.  It was, and remains, an interesting look into a Pastor's life and the inner-workings of the Church.  Although there are many things wrong with the Church, in the end there are many more positive things to celebrate about the Church and the Ministry!",1428883200,3,437,4.551282051282051
7015375,5,B00TPN7EUM,"Why should anyone care about the trials and tribulations of a Methodist minister in the early 20th century?

Because, in my opinion, ""One Foot in Heaven"" is one of the most beautiful films ever produced in Hollywood. A major Warner Brothers release (produced by Hal Wallis), this is an extremely high-quality film that lovingly recreates scenes from the career of real-life minister William Spence (as whimsically related by his son Hartzell in his famous book of the same name).

No earth-shaking events here-- just the day-to-day challenges, the simple joys and heartaches, the small-town politics and frustrations that reveal humanity in all of its imperfections.

I have to chuckle when I realize that Frederic March was regarded as a dull actor; the way in which he carries this films is a textbook example of subtle, honest realism--- tender, gracious, humorous, stern---certainly a bit stodgy--- but willing to ""bend"" when necessary, resourceful, loving, and above all, very human.  Supporting Mr. March is an array of Hollywood's best character actors, along with the extremely detailed sets and costumes which serve as a window to an increasingly distant era in our American past, a time of old-world morality that seems hopelessly lost today. The film was even a bit tame for 1940.

Irving Rapper's direction infuses the film with life and energy; the pace never flags, an amazing achievement considering the film's totally UN-sensational content. Max Steiner's score may seem a tad too pious at times, but it adds the perfect sense of dignity and reverent strength whenever necessary.

And then there is the final scene, one of the most moving and unique in any film that I know. Having spent his life struggling to achieve some degree of comfort for himself (and his family) in service of the Lord, Reverend Spence--now aging and with an ailing heart--- receives a request from his bishop to move on once again to another parish. As I said...nothing earth-shattering.....yet writer, director and composer transform the ending into an emotional farewell, a nearly transcendental vision of the much simpler, more sincere, faith-based society of the time.

A gorgeous spring day in a typical neighborhood, where the townspeople--young and old--- who have come to know and love their minister, all stop their work and ,join in a spontaneous procession through the street, following the sound of the carillon from high in the new church tower. Martha Scott, Frankie Thomas, Gene Lockhart, Beulah Bondi, Harry Davenport, Laura Hope-Crews--- some of whom have locked horns with Mr. March during the course of the film, now walk together through the dappled sunlit street, drawn by the sound of the bells, finally arriving at the church, where they lift their voices in the grand, moving hymn ""The Church's One Foundation"".....and there is Minister William Spence (March) himself, seated high above at the carillon keyboard, struggling to continue playing as the tears stream down his face.

Frankly, I never thought this beautiful film would see a DVD release. I'm glad that it is now commercially available, since the film...like the world it represents...would probably disappear forever.

Great for Easter season viewing.

PICTURE QUALITY-- good; a tad dark, but much better than many of these un-restored releases
SOUND  ""  -- Volume level is very good; sound gets a tiny bit edgy at times, but that's the old Warner Brothers standard.

7015404,5,B00TPN7EUM,"Academy award nominated movie about the life of a Methodist church pastor. Good movie. Good storyline. Great acting. It's a story about the willingness of a family to endure hardship for the sake of the gospel. Even though many of today's American churches have become ""relevant"", modern, wealthy and commercial, this is a great example of how life was like, and maybe still is, for many pastor's families.",1491004800,,406,4.985294117647059

Understated, honest portrayal of a parson in the early part of the 20th century.

7015414,5,B00TPN7EUM,"As a PK (Pastor's kid) this film was everything from my nightmares (and still is) but it was great and funny and in the end, the pastor won (that doesn't happen often). A family friend recommended this film to me (and my mom) and it is literally EVERYTHING we go through and more. I recommend this movie to anybody IN the church and especially pastors and their families. It had some hard moments where your Christianity was tested and you wanted to throw people from the bell tower but the saccharine happy ending is worth it if you like that kind of thing. Being in B&W was a plus.",1462752000,2,583,4.3577981651376145

7015416,5,B00TPN7EUM,"This black & white movie played in the town hall in Harriston, Ontario in 1941. (about 10 miles from where the family had lived before moving to the United States).  My elderly friend was 7 at the time, and she and her mother drove that 10 miles to town in the Model A to see the movie.  They liked it so well they sat through it twice.  When it was over they had to drive home in the dark in a terrible thunder storm.  It was 75 years ago that my friend saw the movie.  She also has the book as written by the ""boy"" in the movie Hartzell Spence.  Before she moved to the nursing home I had helped her with housework for several years and during that time she told me the story and gave me the book to read.  I loved the book.  Have been trying to get the movie for her for several months.  It has been aired on TCM several times but we don't have access to that channel.  I ordered the dvd while I was in Florida and watched it with several friends - all of whom enjoyed it.  My friend's birthday was in April and I got the dvd as a surprize for her.

7015433,5,B00TPN7EUM,"Excellant film about a protestant minister (Fredrick March), his wife(Martha Scott) and their children and the ups and downs of his personal and professional life in pre-World War II Canada and the United States. Warm,engrossing,moving and funny and a shining example of what films used to be and are no longer! Best scenes include - (1)March's first visit(with his son)to a motion picture theatre;(2) March outwitting his aging off-key choir members in order to replace them with a youthful group of on-key singers; and (3)best of all, March's visit to a gardener(Harry Davenport) who works for one of March's rich,female parishioners. This gentle man has never been allowed to set foot in the main house. He and March share tea and conversation in the gardener's  small attic garage ""apartment"" while the rain pours on the roof above.

7015437,2,B00TPN7EUM,"I wanted to like this, because I enjoy Frederick March as an actor, but the story is pretty bland throughout.  Frederick March and Martha Scott, as Mother and Father, are so sugary sweet and long-suffering that they're both martyrs and saints, but not human enough to be appealing.  When they are struck by misfortune, they just patiently carry on with a mild joke and a shrug, which becomes annoying after a while.  Honestly, no one likes a doormat and these two just lie down and take it, again and again!  The ensemble cast is good enough, but none of them stand out in particular.  I kept watching, hoping the film would get better, but it never did.  Not recommended.",1437177600,,672,4.605042016806722

8702579,5,B00TPN7EUM,This is an old fashioned movie with a lot of drama and humor about life in years gone by. The portrayal of the minister and the type of churches and people that are a part of so many church communities was really down to life. It was good to see how difficult it was to serve churches when the rich business persons and the cliche of women kept the church in their pocket. Only someone as brave as the minister portrayed helped to eventually break the back of so many of these type of churches. Excellent movie and very reverent while very realistic of the difficulties.,1524441600,,570,4.386792452830188
