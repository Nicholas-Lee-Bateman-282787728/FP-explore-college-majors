To be helpful as planning for a family vacation, this video does tell you what to expect and what to avoid.",1459468800,,264,4.520833333333333
8093060,4,B000BVM22W,"This was one of the better episodes of Globe Trekker. It was hosted by the attractive Lavinia Tan. It featured a Latin American parade in Miami, nightclubs, scuba diving, alligator wrestling, and a visit to Disney. My favorite part of the DVD was when she visited Cape Canaveral. She interviewed an actual astronaut and she got on a flight simulator.

I only have two complaints- one, this DVD met the Globe Trekker LGBT quota. Fortunately, that scene only lasted 2 minutes. And two, she attended a biker rally full of prospective Tea Party members. Other than that, job well done!",1443657600,,581,4.81
