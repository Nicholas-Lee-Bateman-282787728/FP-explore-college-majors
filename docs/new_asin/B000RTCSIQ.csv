2875496,5,B000RTCSIQ,"The first time I watched this film on Netflix I gave it 4 stars.  I found myself coming back to this film and watching it again.  After I watched it 3 times i gave it 5 stars.

Things are not always what they seem....
The things you do wrong in your life...all of us....it affects you for the rest of your life...

This fantastic film that shows the immense guilt and sadness of one man and how it devastated his whole life.  I'm not terribly religious, but this man, he found his salvation and in the end forgiveness.  He did many good things in his later life, but these things could not heal him until he was forgiven in the end.

There are many fine moments in this film some of which you may not understand in the first viewing.",1305072000,14,733,4.192857142857143
2875497,5,B000RTCSIQ,"This is a wonderful movie about a man who has stripped himself of ego.  The actor is himself a recluse, and I think this movie is close to his soul.",1299456000,11,148,3.933333333333333
2875498,5,B000RTCSIQ,"Entertaining, heartwarming and excellent acting all make this movie superb! For anyone who can appreciate redemptive suffering, you will really be touched by this movie. The love that is shared in the community of the monks, the gentle way they reprimand each other, the genuine care for one another and their good humor is what life should be for us all. God Bless",1298764800,6,365,4.809523809523809
2875499,4,B000RTCSIQ,"This is a special film about a man, overwhelmed by a choice he made during the extremes of war, who resolves to lead a holy life in a monastery.  Locally he becomes known as an especially powerful man, almost a shaman and source of wisdom, but his behavior is bizarre and generates friction with the other monks, in particular the leader.  Disregarding all doubt and jealously, he plows ahead, helping people and reflecting on his life, seeking redemption in his acts.  The ending is a great surprise, unpredictable in the way that Hollywood films never are.

His journey, even for a non-believer like myself, is completely believable, as are his cures and his ability to show people the way.  It is beautiful, too.  I was moved by this film and recommend it to anyone interested in spirituality and human possibility.

The version that I have, region 2, is entirely in Russian with ENglish subtitles.  The images are crisp and very stark.",1298332800,17,939,4.788819875776397
2875500,5,B000RTCSIQ,"When the movie begins, the man who becomes the subject of the film commits an act born of abject terror and shortly thereafter the film fades and reopens 30 yrs. later.  As the scene opens the second time, you find yourself watching the man and his actions and you become aware that what he did years before has brought him such anguish that even now, years later, he still feels it necessary to live the remainder of his life in severe penance.  This man, who has been taken in by the monks on this cold bare island outside of Russia, is admired by the people in the nearby town as a ""Holy Man"" who has actually wrought miracles in their lives, while his fellow monks see only a dirty, unkempt spectacle of a man who refuses to conform to their expectations.  It is hilarious in places, sad in other places, but in the final analysis, his guilt is finally assuaged and a quiet peace fills him and gives him the freedom that he has sought for so many years.

The ending was both life affirming for me and sad at the same time.  I really liked this movie but that was because I understood the penitential life that he was living and why he was living it.  You would have to have that initial understanding, I think, to get anything out of the movie as a whole!

The one lack that I found for this movie was its absolute economy of subtitles.  While the characters speak a great deal at times, the subtitles are few so you have to really pay attention to what is going on to follow it!  Overall it is an excellent movie!",1285027200,59,1518,4.27972027972028

I never did because, although I don't mind movies with subtitles, I just didn't think a Russian movie about the Orthodox Church would keep my attention. Now that I'm about to be a convert also I decided to give this movie a try. I was riveted! I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much five years ago when my wife and I were first married, having no knowledge of the Orthodox Church and its customs and beliefs. Now that I've been immersing myself in the life and the history of the Orthodox Church, I have a much greater understanding of the Orthodoxy. I love this movie!",1514678400,,737,4.3478260869565215

Whether religious or not, it will be thought provoking.  I'd have given this a three, but it got its fourth star for the acting brought to such a film.

2875524,5,B000RTCSIQ,"This is one of my favorites, a movie that dares to venture into the spiritual without getting preachy. Don't worry if you aren't Orthodox, or even Christian for that matter, this movie does take place in a monastery, but they are more frequently a foil for the hero in the story, the least of the monks, a man racked with guilt for an event that took place decades earlier. He is, to say the least, an odd character who truly marches to a different drummer, in a place where living to certain norms is taken to extremes. Our man doesn't play by their rules, yet he appears to have an authority they lack. Some are jealous of his special powers and in some cases that means they have hard lessons to learn.

I'll let others provide the synopsis, and just say that, unlike so many films, the ending was worth any misgivings that I had throughout the show.  I don't expect broad appeal here (especially since it's in Russian), but for those who do enjoy it, it will be high on their list.  One other note: There are a lot of reviews that emphasize the spirituality of this film.  It's there (it IS a film about a monastic enclave, after all) but it isn't necessary to be a highly religious person to (really) enjoy it.  The message and emotion are universal, not targeted, and not ""preachy"".  So, if you're the kind of person that typically avoids religious fare, don't be scared off - watch it anyway because it's worth your time.",1500422400,,854,4.5359477124183005

2875557,5,B000RTCSIQ,"A profound, cleansing, experience.  Very much like a service in an Orthodox church.  I was able to say the prayers along with the monks and hero of the film.
The acting was perfect. I believed the people I saw were actually monks. I believe that the actors felt the importance and spirituality behind what they were portraying and were engulfed by it, and became it. The cinematography was right for the story, and beautiful, it was an expression OF the feelings and thoughts portrayed.

Orthodoxy was one of the first organized Christian religions. Orthodox MEANS ""right belief"" or ""right praise."" The Orthodox try to follow the teachings of Christ and the Apostles as closely as they can.  To BE Orthodox means that you ""walk the walk"" not just ""talk the talk."" That is one of the reasons why when the hero burns the two possession of the head of the monastery...the head thanks him for freeing him...instead of getting angry at him.

To be Orthodox, means that you see sinning as stepping off the path that leads towards God. To be Orthodox means you constantly are trying to come closer to God.  This film was a good introduction into the Spirituality that is Orthodoxy. While many denominations have lost something in their religiosity; The Orthodox way has maintained a beating heart, by keeping spirituality first in it's worship.

It is hard to ""see"" and ""feel' and ""be in"" the un-seeable; but that is what Orthodoxy calls you to do. Like when the head of the monastery in the film rebukes one of the monks for talking about matters of daily concern in the church. He says something like, what you are talking about concerns the world, in here all we are concerned about is worshiping God.  And so, all priests of the Orthodox church tell the members of the church, to remember that when you enter the church you come to adore God.

It is hard to follow the teachings of the Orthodox Church to pray...in the morning, noon, and night, before AND after meals and whenever you have a need or desire to come into contact with God.. To read scripture, and to contemplate it. To do good works. To abstain excess material goods. To give to others. To help others by seeing the good in them, not the bad.  To believe. To struggle to believe. To fight against non-belief. To hold the course. To run the race. To stay true.

People say they ""believe"". But what do they do? How much time do they take to prepare the way they look in the morning? Do they take AT LEAST that amount of time EACH day to draw near to God? We exercise to keep our bodies fit. What do we do to keep our spirit strong? We feed ourselves all day with food, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks....what do we do all day to feel ourselves spiritually. If we REALLY believe, what do we really do?
The Orthodox point this out.

I had communicant's class in the Presbyterian church. I attended the Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, and Episcopalian. I say people who came to church on Sunday, and acted as if this meant, made, them Christian.

In all the churches I have entered I have felt some hush, some ""surrounding"". But in an Orthodox church it can seem more intensified. Sometimes it feels as if you have been washed clean.

This move left me feeling as if my heart had been pulled out and had some of the pain and sin shook out of it also.",1497830400,2,3306,4.525167785234899

2875566,3,B000RTCSIQ,"This interesting Russian-made film kept my attention, if only for the ""art film"" style presented. The story was rather implausible and since I don't buy into much religious clap-trap, I found it to be a study in life coincidences and backward superstition. The main character is obviously mentally ill and the trials of dealing with his games wears not only on the other characters but also on the viewer. It's a slow-paced film, so my enjoyment was derived mostly from the cinematography and the sound of Russian in my ears, which is my 2nd language. Speaking of which, the subtitles were way off in many cases and missing altogether in some. Along with the annoyance of each C being replaced by an O, most of the plaquards weren't even represented at all, so if you can't read or speak Russian? Too bad, Yank. If you are into art films or very long, repetitive dramas, you would appreciate this. Otherwise,  .",1495324800,2,911,4.69375

I thought whether or not this young man gave into his fear wouldn't have changed the outcome for his captain.

I saw a man of God who didn't have faith to believe what he perceived as a horrific sin would be forgiven.

The first time I watched it, I knew I had to share it with my Greek Orthodox friends.  I've never seen a movie before that sheds light on Orthodox spirituality.  Since The Island is about repentance, I decided to have about 10 friends over the house right before Lent, to have dinner and watch this movie--everyone loved it and some were surprised that they loved it.  Now, 9 months later, the movie still comes up in our conversations.

Even though The Island is subtitled, do not let that turn you away!  Somehow, it flows and you do not even notice. It is beautifully filmed.  The message is profound.  I truly wish there were more movies like this to watch.  Congratulations to Petr Mamonov.  He has created a work of art of great spiritual depth.",1385078400,12,917,4.469879518072289
2875614,5,B000RTCSIQ,"Mesmerizingly beautiful and profoundly moving, this 2006 prize winning Russian film THE ISLAND is gratefully brought to the public by Film Movement. Everything about the film - the screenplay by Dmitri Sobolev, the haunting musical score by Vladimir Martynov, the cinematography by Andrei Zhegalov and the direction by Pavel Lounguine (aka Lungin) - is the epitome of sophistication in cinematic art.

The story opens in 1942 in Russia where Nazis come aboard a little Russian craft manned by Tikhon (Aleksei Zelensky) and his mate Anatoly (Timofey Tribuntsev): the Nazi officer threatens Anatoly and in the end has Anatoly shoot Tikhon and the shot Tikhon drops into the cold ocean. Years later somewhere in Northern Russia in a small Russian Orthodox monastery an older Anatoly (Pyotr Mamonov) confuses his fellow monks with his bizarre behavior and his apparent ability to cast out demons, heal, and foretell the future to people who visit the island monastery particularly for Anatoly's gifts.  But Anatoly's mind is racked with guilt because he knows he killed his closest friend Tikhon. Father Filaret (Viktor Sukhorukov), the principal monk, falls under Anatoly's spell and because of Anatoly's simple life, Filaret gives up his worldly goods to be more like Anatoly. Father Iov (Dmitriy Dyuzhev) attempts to bring sanity into Anatoly's life, but in the end he is deeply moved by the crazy priest. One of the visitors brings his insane daughter to Anatoly, Anatoly frees her of demons, and the grateful visitor tells Anatoly that he did not indeed kill Tikhon - that he survived and still lives. And it is in this peace that Anatoly allows himself to die.

The supporting cast has only brief moments on screen but they are memorable. The focus of the film is the portrayal of Anatoly by Pyotr Mamonov - it is a miracle of acting. This is a film that will haunt the viewer not only because of its message but also because of its beauty. As Santayana said, `Sanity is a madness put to good uses.'

2875620,4,B000RTCSIQ,"I'm not exactly a film aficionado so may not have anything really profound to say. The film is dark--in terms of colors as wells as moods and themes. It raises some interesting questions about life and spirituality: Does this really have any relevance for life in general? Do we spend our lives repenting (or just feeling guilty about) imagined sins that may have actually had entirely different outcomes from what we assumed? Where is the line between spirituality and craziness?

What I find most interesting, however, is that this film apparently was hugely popular in Russia; according to The Washington Post, more than 40 percent of Russians have seen it. It is inconceivable that such an introspective, colorless, action-less movie like this could achieve any kind of mass popularity in the U.S. This, in turn, makes one think about the importance of history and cultural, about the profound differences that may lie beneath the surface level on which, in the modern, high-tech world, we may all seem to look and act pretty much the same.

2875622,5,B000RTCSIQ,"I occasionally like to watch movies made in other countries (in this case Russian language, even though the dialog isn't always perfectly translated to match the sub-titles, but it gets the message across), and I do appreciate it when I can follow the movie with English sub-titles at a speed that doesn't flash off the screen before I can read them.

The movie is quite different in style and pace than those made in the USA (which have fast action and lately less dialog).  This movie moved along slowly, and appeared to be dark and colorless, but after a while I got into it when I started to see the characters overcome and teach others some life lessons (as well as repentance, forgiveness, jealously, irony, deep belief and religious devotion, acceptance, and in a strange way humor). The changes the people go through give the story deeper meaning.

The bottom line is I watched this movie several times to get more and more out of it.  It is so good in my opinion that I bought another DVD to share with others. I think I will buy more DVDs to pass them out as well.  I kept thinking about the movie for weeks after I saw it.  I think there are some metaphoric symbolism in it. As one example, the main character shovels coal from a sunken barge (which he initially transported into the area during the Great Patriotic War) and barge which is almost empty at the end of his life.  His crazy actions have a higher purpose which comes to light after some sort of event happens.

Don't compare this to movies made in in the USA, and stay away if you like those kind of movies that require no thought as many current movies.  On the other hand, if you like deeper type movies, this one might please you too.",1349308800,12,1711,4.440894568690096
2875623,3,B000RTCSIQ,"The few Russian movies I have seen tend to telegraph the major story arc far in advance.  This one has a confrontation in the first five minutes that is clearly not final.  Yet it molds and shapes the main character's life in the worst kind of way.  It would seem a monk who is not able to accept forgiveness over 30 years may have wasted everyone's time.

2875624,5,B000RTCSIQ,"""The Island"" is a brutally honest tale concerning unseen warfare within the human heart. Although the screenplay flowed from the pen of a contemporary author, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn's sentiments in ""The Gulag Archipelago"" (1918-1956) share something in common with this extraordinary Russian motion picture. For, as the Nobel Prize winning author commented: ""...even in the best of all hearts, there remains ... an unuprooted small corner of evil. Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety,
but it is possible to constrict it within each person.""

2875626,5,B000RTCSIQ,"This film was powerful. I know that word is a bit overused these days but it describes my feelings on it. I gave it to a Russian speaking Ukrainian friend of mine and he has watched it twice already. His wife has watched it three times. He said it was so realistic. He also said that there are many of these types of monks in Russia. Men who really do perform miracles and are close to God. He says that anyone who seeks God in this way can perform these miracles as a natural outcome of their proximity to the Holy One.

Anyway, I recommend this film wholeheartedly. And don't be put off by the fact that it is only subtitled, though my friend said he was sure we English speakers are missing out on some of the more subtle aspects of the script. However this didn't hamper my viewing experience. It seemed, to me at least, to give a real insight into modern Russian religious thought and practice. The contrast between the extreme religious fervour of the central character with that of the lukewarmness of the average Church goer who came to seek his advice and miracle working power, and the stale pleasure seeking attitudes of the other monks in the monastery.",1331251200,8,1165,4.469483568075117
2875627,4,B000RTCSIQ,"This 2006 film begins in 1942 when a sailor, Anatoly, and his captain are captured by the Nazis.  A young Anatoly begs for his life and in turn, is asked to shoot his captain.  He does, and as the Nazis leave, the ship is blown up.  Anatoly survived.  He is found on the island and now resides in the Monastery.

Jump to 1976, and from hereon in, Anatoly the Russian Orthodox monk is haunted by his past.  People come to the island to see him, as they believe he has powers to heal, can foresee the future and exorcise demons.  However, he does not feel worthy of this power, and chases some away.  He has incredible guilt as a sinner.

He becomes an unusual character in the monastery, a nuisance, trouble maker, prankster, dirty and living amidst the boiler.  He often prays for forgiveness.  He has the brethren thinking.

This film almost looks black and white with the desolate winter and the vast waters of the sea.  The pacing is moderate, as one is intrigued by the actions of Anatoly.  This film was a winner of many awards, including Winner of 5 Nika Awards (Russian Oscars) including Best Film.  ......Rizzo",1321747200,4,1118,4.52
2875628,5,B000RTCSIQ,"The Island represents a soul's journey from fear and acts which can have life-altering affects to finding forgiveness and eventually peace.  The opening gives us a view of a younger man killing his shipmate and captain at the behest of a group of Nazi officers.  He himself was injured and rescued by a group from an isolated Russian Orthodox monastery located on a frozen, coal ladened island.  The setting is very stark and desolate yet exquisite and beautiful.  The director's vision is powerful and it shows throughout this beautiful rich film.

Although some of the other reviews downplay the depiction of the Russian Orthodox Church as being scant and not completely realistic, I found this to be merely a setting.  The man known as Father Anatoly and called a holy man by those seeking his advice and healing touch, does not pretend to be in sync with the practices of the Orthodox way of life completely.  Instead he is an individual who seeks the forgiveness and mercy of a loving god directly and not through the dogma of the organized religious group he finds himself among.  His actions often produce some difficulties and testing with the priests. He takes them all down paths which expose their acts. Although he does appear, at times, as if he might be insane. But with each passing scene one understands the basis of his unusual behavior. (It makes for a less predictable story line which is refreshing and so thought provoking). He is tortured by his great sin and seeks to shed the trappings of this life thru penance, servant hood, isolation and reflection. As a result of his single-mindedness he shows all the ear markings of a true believer, endowed with all holy signs and miracles. For this the community is enriched by his sacrifices.

The acting is amazing, the scenes unforgettable and the story quite life affirming and eye-opening if one is seeking a spiritual life.  Technically it is wonderfully written and powerfully delivered, just about anyone could enjoy this beautiful film whether religious or not.",1313107200,5,2036,4.892441860465116
2875629,3,B000RTCSIQ,"The 2006 film OSTROV (The Island) is a story of religious faith in the bleak Russian north. As the film opens, it is 1942 and the young Russian sailor Anatoly is forced by the Germans to shoot his captain Tikhon. Left for dead, Anatoly washes up on the shore of an island where a monastery is located. He spends the next three decades among the monks trying to atone for the killing of his friend and shipmate. Eventually, though he considers himself the lowest of the low, Anatoly is granted clairvoyance and the ability to work miracles. A steady stream of visitors comes to the island to seek his help.

But Anatoly is a certain kind of saint specific to the Russian tradition, the holy fool. He does things that make no sense to his fellow monks, to the point they think he's insane, but eventually everything he does is revealed to communicate some key spiritual point. Between ministering to the outsiders who visit him and dealing with his exasperated brethren, Anatoly gets no rest.

The film is beautiful in a way. The plot is engaging enough, and for audiences outside Russia (as well as many Russians who grew up under Communism) this is an informative presentation of the realities of Orthodox monastic life. The makeup effects are excellent -- Pyotr Mamonov doesn't look this decrepit in real-life, but on the screen he really is convincing as a starets who has spent decades in an unforgiving environment.

Nonetheless, I found OSTROV rather too heavy-handed, seeming at best sappy and at worst outright propaganda for a certain kind of contemporary Russian Orthodoxy that doesn't represent the faith entirely well. When one thinks of Russian Orthodoxy in cinema, one is tempted to draw comparisons with Andrei Tarkovsky, but even when Tarkovsky wasn't directly using Orthodox themes, he still communicated Christian truths more powerfully than anything in this film (think of the climax of Tarkovsky's STALKER or the ending of OFFRET).

All in all, OSTROV is entertaining, but not terribly deep.",1309651200,6,2010,4.937869822485207
2875630,5,B000RTCSIQ,this movie moved me very deeply. The acting is done very well and the message is timeless. Everyone should see this movie. In these modern times we often forget about what is really at the core of the spiritual life.,1307232000,8,216,4.425
8202525,5,B000RTCSIQ,"A teenage man is pressured by Nazis to kill the captain of his ship. He himself is then blown up as they unsuspectingly have left a bomb on his boat. Left for dead, he drifts to a Island where he is rescued by Russian Orthodox Monks and becomes a rather eccentric-appearing priest, reknown for his ability to help and heal in rather unorthodox ways. As one who does not know Russian, I found it easy to follow the English subtitles as there is not much dialogue. This is a unique movie with a very inspirational thrust. Highly recommended.",1524441600,,539,4.510204081632653

The Island is authentic, dark, beautiful, edgy, honest, realistic, and brilliant. Its not set that far back in time, but it still makes me wonder if our ancestors of any past era would let us into their churches if we took our version of Postmodern American Christianity-lite back in time.",1521676800,,399,4.882352941176471

8202529,5,B000RTCSIQ,"Most of the time Christian movies equal torture. Truly ghastly viewing that makes a pre school play look like Shakespeare's finest. Well, their that thought out of your mind. THE ISLAND proves you can have excellent solid scripts that are exciting, meaningful, and engaging without compromise on faith and integrity. THE ISLAND is visually stunning, the acting is superb. More importantly this movie accurately portrays Orthodox Christianity and the struggle of that way of life. Monk or lay person, it matters not. Our struggles and joys, ups and downs are the same. I highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE.",1520208000,,610,5.171717171717172

8202534,5,B000RTCSIQ,"A difficult review to write because all the appropriate adjectives have been used - gritty, uplifting, dark, raw, emotional, poignant, and so many more.

In an act of cowardice, a seaman shoots his Captain to avoid being murdered by Nazis.  Knowing he will not be forgiven by others if they discover his secret, he struggles constantly, yet unsuccessfully, to forgive himself.  Becoming a priest in a monastery doesn't cleanse his soul, and neither does his daily work routine, hauling coal to stoke the boiler for the monastery.  Even his gifts of healing others cannot heal his own tortured heart.

As with all morality tales, there is redemption, but you'll have to watch the flick to discover its source.

A wonderful tale well told.",1516579200,,737,4.951219512195122
