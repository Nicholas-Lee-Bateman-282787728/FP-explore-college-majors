8128940,5,B000G5SMPE,I was told about Hoxsey and how hw came to discover this solution and how the FDA shut it all down because there was no $$$$ for them. I learned of this in 1986. You don't have to die of cancer. Find a Hoxsey clinic and go get cured. No conventional U.S. physician will cure you. They don't know how. Be well.,1519084800,,309,4.0

8128942,5,B000G5SMPE,Must read for everyone. So much history into the way the medical field was set up and is run by a bunch of money hungry doctors who would rather make a buck of your illness than to help you to heal. So much more to this book than the story of Harry which is amazing. This book brought up so many emotions in me. Mostly anger at the way things are done.,1461196800,,352,3.9027777777777777
8128943,5,B000G5SMPE,"And old book, but a winner in my mind. If you want to understand cancer, this is a good one to read.",1433721600,,100,3.590909090909091
8128944,5,B000G5SMPE,Absolutely wonderful story that everyone should see.,1416787200,,52,6.571428571428571
8128945,5,B000G5SMPE,"Movie gives a good insight in what we call ""Money is ruling the world"". It's a shame that medical Establishment only supports chemical and toxic and poisening remedies, that kill People instead of healing them. Reason? -> Only new created artificial substances can be patented and are able to become a pharma Blockbuster. Not so remedies from nature. They are free to human beeings. Hoxsey was not the only one. I think on Gerson (Juicing), Krebs (Amygdalin), Burzynski (Anti-neoplastons) and much more.",1379808000,,503,5.146341463414634
8128946,4,B000G5SMPE,"Great video, recommend it to anyone with an open mind. Welcome to the age of information where truth cannot be suppressed any longer. Quack Who Cured Cancer is an eyeopener to the Naysayers of the medical establishment as well as the credulous public who go along with the propaganda pushed by the priests in white lab coats. After millions of years of evolution, when H.G.Wells' Eloi (advanced breed of course) with gather round to listen to high tales of their ancestors, they will recall all those brave men and women that did everything to save their species - among the list of those maverics such as Gerson, Butwig, Pastor, Krebs, and others will be the name of Harry Hoxey -  The Quacks who Cured Cancer. Remember Victor Hugo's quote: 'No army can stop and idea whose time has come!' Stay healthy and vigilant! Cheers.",1368316800,3,825,4.729166666666667
8128947,5,B000G5SMPE,"One in three people is somehow affected by cancer on themselves, their family or friends. There are cures that really work. Everyone should know this story especially before embarking on a journey to health.
This movie has important information and story how the American Cancer Society  and FDA prevent finding a real cure to cancer. They don't want to go out of business. Cancer is a billion dollar business and the FDA, American Cancer Society, General Electric who created the mammography, and others work together to assure that the real healers, those who create real enduring cures for cancer, are locked out of the US market. many, like Hoxsey and Burzinsky have gone to Mexico. Hoxsey was ready to sell to US drug company but on the condition that it is made available to those who cannot pay lots of money for it. The drug company would not abide by that and so Hoxsey did not sell it to them. Then the FDA harassed him and closed down his clinic. Most of money we give to American Cancer Society has been spent on everything but a cancer cure. Why do I get calendars, address labels and other junk form them in the mail? Why has there been no new cures for several decades? Why is there more advertising to raise funds then there is talk about any specific break-throughs in finding a cure?
Watch Hoxsey. Also watch ""Cut Poison Burn"" and watch ""Burczinsky"" movies to get more of the story. Also read The Silent Betrayal. Can buy most of these on Amazon or [...]
Cancer cure hoax is about money and protection of the money interests from anything that really works unless it can earn billions for the drug companies. Cures that don't cost more than pennies are outlawed.
Please watch this before you let anyone put poison chemo in you or radiate you or cut you up. There are alternatives and there are real cures.",1362441600,6,1823,4.5920245398773005
8128948,5,B000G5SMPE,"I bought this DVD based on my knowledge on natural medicine. It is encouraging as a believer in natural medicine that this really works but upsetting with all the obstacles done over the years by AMA, Big Pharma and Health insurances Corporations ect. This DVD shows the testimonies of many cured by this holistic medicine and how politics and big money can do against you and your health.",1339027200,4,389,4.735294117647059
