4195007,5,B003UCA4XI,"Acting a little stiff, but the message is way to important to miss.  I watched it three times.  Life is so full of such nonsense, even church goes and even preachers mess up big time.  We need to get on with what would Jesus do in more
situations in our lives.  Buy it pass it on and you producers, get going on making movies that show people
more about what this movie says...  My husband and 15 yr. old granddaughter loved the film. The man playing the devil
was great too...he is so in our life...so real.  I will buy this movie and share it with others.",1301788800,,557,4.158878504672897
4195008,5,B003UCA4XI,Loved it.  Get it.  It will open your eyes and make you a better person.  We should all strive to be more like Christ.,1297641600,,118,3.8333333333333335
4195009,5,B003UCA4XI,I rented a few weeks back and I must say that this really gets the message of God out. Great plot in the movie. The only thing I don't see alot of in the town I live in. Very rarely I see people helping others. If only every community would change like this I think the world would be better off then. God bless everyone that made this film.,1296000000,,341,3.9565217391304346
4195010,1,B003UCA4XI,My husband and I would love to see this movie but it has no closed caption on this DVD. It is very sad that they didn't put it on it. Jesus would love us to see the movie but can't understand what it been said.,1295136000,4,210,3.688888888888889
4195011,5,B003UCA4XI,"I have always been a great fan of John Schnieder's.  I think he is a great actor and can really really sing well.  Loved his Come Dance at My Wedding also. This is a great movie and you can see how things can be changed by just one person.
Watched this a lot and enjoyed it every time.",1294099200,,285,3.896551724137931
4195012,5,B003UCA4XI,"This movie is wonderful!  The message is clear and poignant.  How do you live your life?  Do you treat others as you would like to be treated?  Do you do the right thing?  In everything you do, ask ""What would Jesus do?"":  this will help you do what is right, to live your life to help others, and to be able to live with and face yourself.

Watch this movie and use it as you contemplate how you live your life.  What would Jesus do???",1293580800,,436,4.047058823529412
4195013,5,B003UCA4XI,"If you are smug in your Christian life, or even are not, this movie is for you. How do you maintain your faith when you, a pastor, saw God allow the death of your wife and two children in a horrible car accident? You are a mugger. How do you return to your faith when you observed your mother pray devoutly all her life, and see her life end tragically? (Do you conclude that it did her no good?)

The questions continue for Christians of various occupations. How do you turn away a needy job-seeker? How do you allow salacious material to be printed in your newspaper? How do you accept a lucrative music-making contract when it involves the playing of immoral songs? How do you revive a dying church? How do you prevent a casino from being built where the church stood for over a century? How do you stop a heartless, amoral politician running for mayor in your town.

You must start by believing that with God all things are possible. You also repent. And so on...",1292716800,57,967,4.396648044692737
4195014,2,B003UCA4XI,"I rented this movie and was glad I did before I purchased it. Although the story line was a good premise...the ruined it with bad acting. The only actor who seemed at all genuine was John Schneider.

About half way through the movie my friends and I just looked at each other and laughed. With most Christian movies, you expect low budget. You expect little to no special effects, but a good message.

This message was...ok. But the acting was horrible. I mean just aweful. And I like Christian movies alot. It was flat and unbelievable. However, the theme song is catchy.

I would rent this and see if you like it before you buy it. Or buy a cheaper copy.

Some kids may like it, as kids don't quite understand good acting yet.",1292457600,19,728,4.41044776119403
4195015,5,B003UCA4XI,"Excellent message - how one person can change how a whole town lives by simply saying ""What would Jesus do?"" This movie is loosly based on the 1898 novel, ""In His Steps: What would Jesus Do?"" by Charles Sheldon. The names are the same, but the story takes a modern tone, but the valuable lesson is the same. A drifter, played by John Schneider is shunned by the community even the pastor of a dying church, played by Jim Gleason, tells him ""I'm sorry that I can't help you."" But the message the drifter brings to a church is ""would Jesus act that way?"" As church members start changing the way they do things from running their businesses to helping the less fortunate, the wave of love and goodness takes over the town even when a greedy, ruthless politician wants to take over.

This message is vital to the world in this day and age. Imagine what would happen if every Christian would think before acting and ask themselves ""what would Jesus do in my place?

4195188,3,B003UCA4XI,"Not seen this movie: What would Jesus Christ do is a question much people know.
Jesus Christ is God. God has done that what we know and this stand at last in the bible.
Everything what we experienced with God, those who are saved, never say that God is not the same like ever in all eternity back and from then to all eternity.
We need God and what we do, is from beginning of each ""ME"" to be one time at God in heaven: back to God where we come from.
What would Jesus Christ do? In each case never God needs someone to live godjustice and God is perfect: do you, too? (Important: God do create and never do need this what we do: ""my wife and got children"": Father of us is how we do call him since his son was born. Jesus Christ has a human body and we do have a human body, too but we have got a soul: our soul ""ME"", Jesus Christ has got the Holy Spirit: ""Yes dear God ""Father of us, Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit"" you Fahter of us, and you Lord Jesus Christ are one with you Holy Ghost. Saved ones by you Jesus Christ are blessed with you Holy Spirit. And you Jesus Christ was born by virgin Maria. I know it was hard for you to be sourrounded by sin, while having hold in you Father of us, who gave to you Jesus Christ by getting older everything: Colossians 2.3. You are God ""Father, Son and Holy Spirit"". Amen. Yours Marcus. Amen""

I am a protestant missionary kid who lived two years in Mexico from age two to four and ten years in Guatemala and though I have not Spanish blood and am a millionaire in my business, I have seen and learned a lot about true and ""hypocritical"" Christianity and this movie tells a great story about Christians facing emotional, spiritual and financial crisis and I have faced a lot of it myself including my divorce, a violent spouse and being in a coma for two weeks almost three years ago, and this movies sums up the way to live right despite our hurts, habits and hang ups to use the ""Celebrate  Recovery"" terminology which, though I have  never  had, nor do I have a drinking or drug problem, tells  me how to live a Christian life despite what has come my way and this movie helps me heal further. Watch it. I have three copies and also have it on ITunes.  It is an incredible story and I have been told that the man who plays the best key part is one of the Dukes of Hazard men, either Bo or Luke.  I highly recommend this movie.

It's time American people and the world got back to God and family before His return so we can go home with Him.

4195265,5,B003UCA4XI,"Christian movies frequently suffer from flat, one dimensional stories that only appeal to so-called Christians while the rest of the world sees them coming a mile away and instantly reject before ever given a chance.  Not exactly so for this one. This movie grapples some tough, real-world challenges and does a good job despite not having the luxury of a big budget or high-paid Hollywood actors.
The movie was no doubt brought to fruition by dedicated people trying to bring an important message to the world and they succeeded.  The movie uses such cinematic elements as decent lighting techniques for skin tone and shadows and even a few jib/crane shots. Some critics belittle the acting but overall the characters are well represented.

John Schneider delivers an outstanding portrayal of a poor homeless man who clearly is a disciple and messenger of God. He enters a spiritually starving and economically crumbling town on the verge of worsenng yet more at the hands of a corrupt politician mis-leading people towards a false solution. Though outwardly poor, the hitchhiker is inwardly blessed with God's grace and mission to spread the truth and hope of Jesus to people ranging from homeless to wealthy who despite their financial status are all starving for the real answer. He is coldly shunned by everyone in the town, including the greedy, the common man, the wealthy, the church-goers who call themselves Christians and even the Christians who are weak in following God.  Before collapsing before them in church, with no resent he humbly calls them to account asking what it really means to follow Jesus and what makes one kind of man less worth saving than another?  Then he challenges, ""when you find yourself struggling with life's difficult decisions, ask yourself one simple question - what would Jesus do?""

The message shakes the congregation leading them to question the true condition of their hearts and realize they are all either self-righteous hypocrites, lost or have wandered from God.

This is where the movie falls a little weak. The message is not made clear enough as to what it takes to really change a heart. If not careful it can easily be thought that all we need to do is to try harder to be better people and help each other. But a fundamental life change and ability to really do what Jesus wants can only be achieved when we submit to God and seek his guidance and strength.
The hitchhiker best demonstrates this by meeting each challenge and confrontation armed with scripture because his life and strength come from his walk with God. The hopeless pastor briefly prays twice for God's help, but the other characters change of heart are pretty much left unexplained.  They transform quickly from cold and uncaring to remorseful and kind. The real estate lady confesses her wrongs were ""before she asked Jesus into her life"" so there is a faint message there, but the movie almost borders at a point on being a G-rated family movie where they all lived happily ever after without doing justice to what it took to cause such a revival. It would have required more screen time but a simple prayer of repentence and receiving salvation would have helped make a powerful statement in showing their change of heart.
Because of this it seems that most of the characters are supposed to be lukewarm or downright cold Christians who just plain don't follow God until their conscious is charged and they then band together to do good. Either way the message is a positive one. I just wish they had more carefully and powerfully crafted and demonstrated it for greater effectiveness.

However, to be fair the movie takes on a lot of life's difficulties by use of it's many characters who deal with disastrous loss of loved ones, loss of faith, moral struggles at the cost of financial security and more. It even shows the world's frequent reception to followers of Jesus with the characters being laughed at, criticized, called ""Jesus freaks"" and reminded that they aren't Jesus in an effort to discourage them.  Yet they pull together, overcome the tough times and do what needs to be done to help their town and fellow citizens by seeking to do what Jesus would do.

If you haven't seen it, buy it and share it with others. For the price it sells for on Amazon it's a no-brainer. It's not a perfect movie, but it's fairly good and we need more like it. It fails as an evengelical tool since the gospel message is absent. A lost person will never take from this movie that being a Christian isn't like joining a club, but rather it means a supernatural change of heart done by God in a repentant sinner. Thus, no one is going to come to Christ by watching this.

However, lukewarm Christians and fakes will be convicted to change their worldly lives, but that can only be done by the afore mentioned intervention of God. No one can know what Jesus would do and be able to do it unless they have first been transformed by Him and then walk with Him in prayer, Bible reading and obedience. May God bless you.",1390608000,8,5037,4.744

Good and godly male leaders is what we need in this world (of course, that's just my personal feeling that I would have liked to have seen in the movie).

On a side note, I watched a movie called ""Radio"" that caught the realness and godliness of living for others.

Really think about all the missed opportunities to make a difference in other people's lives and either our reluctance to get involved or wearing blinders. Jesus comes to us in many forms, would you answer his cry for help? Our we so jaded that we can see Christ in others? He is subtle in revealing Himself when opportunities arise. We are expecting to Jesus, not the homeless man on the street, the lonely and depressed. Like it or not they are Him. A great family movie, that teaches great lessons and values.

This movie helps us to remember that as Christians no faith is ever too much and we are all here for a purpose and that purpose is to serve God, to do His Work. We are called as Christians to share the faith, not only through our words, but through our actions as well. Just because we attend Sunday service does not mean we are true Christians. Our faith entails the way in which we live our lives. When we see someone in need are we helping them or just pushing them away?

I plan to recommend this movie to everyone I know, and probably buy several more copies as gifts for friends, relatives, and a church Ive gone to.

4195351,5,B003UCA4XI,"""WWJD: What Would Jesus Do"" focuses on people from a town that act like they have no faith left. Major life circumstances happen to these people who attend the same congregation and they give up on serving God from their hearts. A homeless man asks for help from the members of the congregation at different times and is rejected in many ways.

The scriptural foundation of this movie film for me was 1 Peter 5, which was mentioned throughout the film. John Schneider played the homeless man/prophetic visitor and did an excellent job. The music by Adam Gregory was very touching to me and gets a very important point across about what Jesus would do in the same situations that the congregation members faced.

This is one film that all Jesus-following congregations should benefit from. It really can make people think about why they would want to be a follower of Jesus at all if they don't want to do what Jesus would do. I believe it would be a great film to watch with congregation members of all ages who have not learned how to treat people the way that Jesus would in different situations such as homelessness, sickness, loss, etc. I believe it would also be a great film for people to watch who already understand how to treat people in these ways but need a refresher and want to learn ways to put what have learned into action.",1324080000,24,1339,4.551867219917012
4195352,5,B003UCA4XI,"This is the kind of movie that will never be outdated. It is not a flashy, fleshy, worldly type of movie. It is decent, and honest, a movie inspiring us to follow God through the example of his son Jesus.
There are several different characters in the movie, of many different types of people,  following the ambitions of their own soul. This changes when a poor, jobless, homeless man who was badly treated by almost everyone in the town steps upon the platform at the end of a service where the Pastor is telling the church he is leaving and the church will be torn down and rebuilt elsewhere so a casino can be put on it's sight. The poor man tells the people how badly he was treated ,and he couldn't help wonder what Jesus would have done, then falls out cold on the floor of the church.
This so touches the peoples hearts and minds, that it motivates them to act, and fight to keep the church, and live a life that is pleasing to God in helping others, and not just pleasing ourselves.
You can't help but fall in love with all the players.
It is a great family movie teaching all to value the call of God on their lives.
I would recommend it to every one that calls themselves
 a Christian. And to those that would like to know about Jesus, and what following him is all about!!!",1324080000,27,1284,4.279835390946502

I was so excited for this movie, but it didn't even follow 1/2 of the storyline of the book.  Sometimes movies are good - just different - despite the fact that they strayed from the book, but this one destroyed itself.  It should have just stuck with the storyline and it maybe could have survived.  The changes that they made totally destroyed the story, making it almost unbearable to watch.  If the storyline was good I could have put up with the horrible acting, but there was nothing good about this movie.  I am giving my copy to goodwill, and would not recommend this to anyone!!

4195358,1,B003UCA4XI,"The message of this film is ok, but the reality is you could just have easily called this movie, 'what would Buddha do?' and get the same results. If everyone lived their lives according to the teachings of Buddha the world would be a much better place. And therein lies the problem with most Christian films; they oversimplify everything, all the Christians are good and all the atheists are bad. The reality is most non-christians are not bad people with drug and alcohol addictions and marriage problems, Christians do not have a monopoly on 'good'. If your life needs turning around you could achieve excellent results with a self-help book by Dr Phil or Tony Robbins, the bible is not the only way to get  your act together. Which leads me to the main problem with this film; nothing is resolved. At the start of the film all the problems are financial and by the end of the film the people have decided to go to church and ask themselves what would Jesus do? But so what? In the film a musician turns down a recording contract because pop music is evil and his mother goes ape because they're about to lose the house. Five minutes later she's in church singing along with the rest of them, but there's no explanation as to her change of heart or how they're going to keep their house. Another woman goes mental when her daughter allows a homeless girl to live with them, five minutes later she's taking the girl shopping and maxing out her credit card. Similarly a newspaper editor stops printing racy sex scandals and goes to church instead, but we don't see what she intends to do when circulation of her newspaper plummets and she goes out of business...
The main protagonist is a guy who we learn is in the final stages of cancer, once people start going to church he jumps out of bed and quits town. WTF? Did he have cancer or not? Is he dying and trying to spread the message of Jesus before he dies? Why doesn't he pray for the cancer to disappear(I hear Jesus is the man if you need a miracle)?

John Schneider did a wonderful job portraying his role in this film. It made me realize that I need to think about how I react to people and how I need to make decisions in my life. That is, to always ask myself before making a decision, ""What Would Jesus Do?"" If I do this I will not only make the right decision, but also be following God's will for my life.

Most of the main characters are adult white males and there is no depth. Real life situations would be more impressive than the pseudo down-and-out characters they try to portray. Everyone is one-dimensional and a high schooler could write better. Everything feels staged, even the delivery of the message the film makers were trying to get across.

While the movie tried to show characters using the teachings of Jesus in real-life situations it fell terribly short and used way too many stereotypes. Please save your money and get something else instead.",1304294400,5,793,4.823529411764706
4195362,2,B003UCA4XI,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  The idea was a good one - unfortunately it is poorly executed.  From the slow moving script, to the 70's era back music, to the bad acting - it was all just too much to suffer through after about 30-40 minutes.  I'm sure there was redemption but I (and the rest of my family) needed to be redeemed from the agony of sitting through the entirety.  It was that bad.  Every stereotype is overdone and the guy who's supposed to be the most sympathetic character comes off as a scary stocker.  He's begging everyone to give him a chance to do an honest day's work to earn a meager wage, with an appropriate bible verse ready to roll off his tongue at all the right moments,  but he's confrontational, aggressive and nearly yelling at everyone he's asking help of - most of whom are the among the most downright heartless people imaginable toward him.  Even so, I would call the cops on him too if he persisted in my personal space after ambushing me at the back door of my business - yes, even though I'm a Christian.  It was almost laughable. Though we didn't make it to the end, I'm confident that everything was wrapped up in a neat little package and everyone lived happily ever after.  Surely there are more excellent modern day representations out there.  Much more enjoyable, with still not the greatest acting overall, was The Secret of Jonathan Sperry.  Our 10 year old son especially enjoyed that one.  I imagine I'll catch flack about this review but I'm sticking to it.
