Don't understand the ""no one under 18 period"" rating, though.  It was about as bad as Creature Feature or Final Destination.  The ending is a MUST see - total surprise!  Great show!

This show is from an independent maker, but the story line is incredible for even the big giants like MGM, etc.

I don't care for DVDs, as it seems every 4-5th one I get is unwatchable due to scratches or skips or whatever reason.  Got tired of the hassle, so went back to VHS, which is way easier to deal with!",1127001600,,642,4.162601626016261
