2806315,1,B000OYR8BQ,"This is perhaps the worst ""movie"" I have seen.  It looks and sounds like one of those really bad old Disney shows about some kid's cat that gets lost or something along those lines.  If you like to see cats chase rabbits and other embarrassingly obvious filler-clips, you'll like this.  The narrator adopts (hopefully) a corn-pone accent that is supposed to be homey and trustworthy.

2806318,3,B000OYR8BQ,"""The Legend of Bigfoot"" is a hilarious look at the tracking of the elusive creature during an epic trek across the great white north. The film features footage by Ivan Marx (and his wife), a wildlife tracker who seeks to find bigfoot, and presents this laughable spectacle as incontrovertible proof of the Sasquatch. The entire film is narrated by Marx, and largely consists of wildlife footage of animals like deer, bears, skunks, and chipmunks, with a few alleged bandy-legged bigfoot shots slipped in for good measure. He even illustrates his home life with footage of a coyote cub versus kitten versus chicken versus skunk confrontation in his front yard.

Marx specializes in finding ""renegade animals,"" and after an Indian folklore subplot, he shows us tracks and hair of a bigfoot. He solicits bigfoot information from the locals and receives some hilarious photos of ""bigfoot"" complete with red glowing eyes. He goes into the woods and promptly sights a bigfoot and notes that ""a nauseating, musky odor made it difficult to breathe."" After seeing this film you'll understand how he felt. There are countless shots of Marx running through the woods to find the creature, then to get away from it. I cannot imagine why scientists rejected this ""evidence"" that he gathered.

Since Marx saw a bigfoot close to his home, he, logically, decides to go to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the coast of Oregon, and to the arctic circle (where Marx assures us that bigfoot breeds) seeking bigfoot, because he believes that bigfoot is a migratory creature. Early in his trek (about 30 minutes into the film) Marx tastelessly shows the majesty of nature by showing a mating pair of squirrels, one of which gets squashed by a car. Why Marx put this into the film I have no clue, but it's genuinely disturbing as the surviving mate is shown dragging the corpse back across the road toward its nest. This scene goes on for a long, long time and I was genuinely repulsed by it. It was too bad the animal was killed; that Marx thought he needed to show it so graphically and extensively is tasteless and abhorrent.

During the remainder of the movie we learn a lot of interesting facts about bigfoot. For instance, did you know that when a migrating bigfoot passes a flock of goats the goats ""commit ritual suicide"" by eating cement? (I am not making this up.) Did you know that bigfoot will carry other dead bigfoots (bigfeet?) thousands of miles to above the arctic circle to dump the bodies in crevasses where the movement of the glaciers crush the remains or dump them into the sea? (My first reaction to that information was to ponder that if bigfoot was a solitary creature, how did another bigfoot know when and where a fellow bigfoot died so as to retrieve the body?) Did you know that if you died in the arctic a bigfoot patrol would recover your body and dump it on the outskirts of the nearest town to afford you a proper burial? Did you know that bigfoot is immune to tuberculosis and measles? (No information is provided about mange, I'm sorry to report.) All these and other facts are presented here for your consideration and laughter.

Marx certainly has rigorous standards for accepting evidence: for example, we meet ""Yukon Frieda"" who paints pictures of bigfoot as described to her. Surely that must withstand the scientific method! Marx then goes on to describe how the mother of an old Indian died and that night they awakened to find a bigfoot at the front door chanting in his mother's voice telling them to leave the cabin. They did and later a glacier changed the course of a river, flooding the village. Thank goodness that bigfoot is so easily to channel. Another Indian tells a wholly lucid (not!) story of how he was out with his sled dogs and the angry bigfoot tribe turned the sky red with blood, while a good bigfoot spirit became the ""legendary white raven"" and protected him. (Apparently the peyote is very strong in that area.) Just then the Indian and Marx see the ""legendary white raven"", which Marx helpfully shows us. (It appears to be a blurry Polaroid of a seagull.) The Indian says that the appearance of the good raven means that the bigfoot likes Marx, and he teaches Marx a chant with drum accompaniment that will summon bigfoot during a full moon if Marx is in the wilderness. Marx said ""I felt as if I was coming apart at the seams."" I believe that he was, though not perhaps in the manner intended, as he said that after he did the chant he saw two glowing lights in the distance that at first looked like car lights, but must have been bigfoot's glowing eyes! To illustrate this, we see what appear to actually be car lights about two miles distant. Unfortunately, when he went to investigate, dawn broke and the lights disappeared behind a rainbow (!) making him feel quite disappointed. He then decided to go for a walk by himself (though someone else filmed it), and he saw some caribou. He then deduced that (get ready for a good one...) the lights he saw were actually caribou scraping velvet off their antlers, releasing swamp gas from the tundra which glowed in the night.(So bigfoot is actually glowing swamp gas?) It's a strange but hilarious ending to the glowing eyes story.

After a huge amount time spent on the technicalities of moose breeding (which Marx claims nobody had ever witnessed before him) and salmon spawning, Marx decides to rent a plane. Almost immediately they spot a ""young bigfoot"" by a river, though when they land, he's gone. (Isn't that always the way it goes?) Marx then has a brilliant insight. Given the coordinates of this bigfoot, he can predict that the next destination for the bigfoot will be a beaver swamp, so Marx goes to one and sets up a bigfoot blind to hide in. It doesn't take long, of course, until a couple of bigfoots show up. He claims that it was before dawn, but from the lighting appears to have been around noon. He remarks ""His odor was overwhelming!"" (make your own joke here), and launches into pontification on how bigfoot is a nocturnal ""benevolent creature"" who eats ""tender swamp grass"", and he is definitely not a carnivore. He concludes with the thought that he now had incontrovertible proof and that ""now we can begin to understand the place this creature holds in nature.""

Never mind that the creatures look more like George Barrows in a gorilla costume or even Teen Ape than a Sasquatch, this movie is captivating in it's own peculiar way. It has long stretches of extreme boredom while listening to Marx bring forth homespun homilies about nature and such, but it has moments of inspired, though unintentional, hilarity. Unfortunately it also has the squirrel crushing scene, which made me remove a full two stars from its rating for tastelessness; otherwise this film would have scored a perfect five stars for camp value. It will definitely not make a believer out of a skeptic, and probably won't even reinforce the opinions of genuine believers for that matter, but for pure pretentiousness, ludicrous plotpoints, and sheer camp value ""The Legend of Bigfoot"" is a must see for any fan of grade-Z cinema.",1223769600,12,7110,4.734463276836158

- if you die in the arctic, Bigfoot will find your body and carry it to the nearest town

2806323,1,B000OYR8BQ,"Ivan Marx and his 1976 film The Legend of Bigfoot hold a unique place in the annals of Bigfoot history.  You will find this film somewhere in the land between mockumentary and documentary; personally, I would categorize it as a documentary begging to be mocked.  With his down-home colloquialisms, self-deprecating manner, and apparent earnestness in his pursuit of Bigfoot, Marx almost sounds credible early on - kooky, but credible.  Then you get a look at some of the Bigfoot footage he shot - let's just say it's not hard to see why those dadgummed scientists and other experts he's always going on about didn't exactly line up in support of his claims.  He fails to mention the fact that this central piece of 16mm film, lasting about thirty seconds and dating back to 1971, had long been proven a hoax already - but, of course, you don't really need anyone to tell you it's fake, what with the creature apparently doing an exaggerated imitation of the gait of Gunsmoke's Festus (which also reportedly bears a strong resemblance to Marx's own bowlegged walking style).

Marx leads the viewer on a semi-epic journey, venturing farther and farther north in pursuit of undeniable evidence of Bigfoot's existence.  He boasts early and often about having figured out the migratory patterns of Bigfoot, and that knowledge leads him way up into the Yukon, above the Arctic Circle, to the mating grounds of the moose (and Bigfoot, or so says Marx).  And wouldn't you know it, after a series of hits and misses, frustrations and doubts, he ultimately finds what he is after, yielding more film of the elusive Bigfoot carousing by a stream and strolling through another field.  The creature is always far away and immersed in shadow, but Marx seems satisfied that his film will provide his many doubters with the undeniable proof they seem to demand.

Apart from a lot of nature footage that looks every bit its age (especially with it having been taken on 16mm film), there's virtually nothing of substance to be found here.  The film can be entertaining at times, with Marx's many colloquialisms regarding the foolishness of his search, his passionate self-praise for his own endeavors, and his snide attitude toward scientists and other experts who don't accept the least little bit of his theories and evidence - but the only useful bit of information you can glean from this mess is some insight into the wrong way to hoax a Bigfoot film.

Animal lovers should know that there are scenes of violence in this story, and I'm not just talking along the lines of predator and prey.  About a half hour into the film, you'll find one of the most heart-breaking scenes I've ever suffered through.  You start off with two squirrels, supposedly mates, chasing each other and generally having the time of their lives; then (and you see it coming from a mile away), you watch one of them get run over.  Everything then stops; there's no music, all the surrounding animals are shown staring at the scene, and you watch the other squirrel try to help her mate up before slowly dragging him off to the side.  Marx claims to experience a Bigfoot-related epiphany from this tragic scene that seems to last forever, but it's a piece of insight everyone else on earth had as a young child.  The whole scene is just gratuitous, which makes it even harder to watch.  I almost stopped watching the film then and there, but I ultimately forged ahead to see what kind of lame evidence this guy would string together at the very end.  Needless to say, Ivan Marx isn't fooling anybody.

There is really no reason whatsoever to watch The Legend of Bigfoot.  Thanks to that tragic scene with the squirrels, I can't even say the film is good for a laugh.",1185840000,,3726,4.747286821705426

2806347,4,B000OYR8BQ,"A professional tracker from the wilds of Illinois tracks Bigfoot to the Artic Circle, Fascinating stuff, truly fascinating. This guy has a way with the wild, he is so at home in the wild that he has a cougar who hangs around him whilst he tracks Bigfoot, a coyote for a pet that his wife reprimands for trying to kill the household chickens and a few other wildlife creatures that live in his yard. He first ends up with a tracking job in Arizona, his brother in law tells him that Bigfoot might be real and off we go for a whirlwind adventure into the untamed wilds of Northernmost North America.
This guy has casts of Bigfoot prints, film of Bigfoot sightings and hair pulled directly out of the mouth of a bear that has been mauled by a Bigfoot. What more could credible scientists want? He has film that captured an image of a Bigfoot with polio! For the love of everything holy, how can science doubt this?
The eyes, the glowing eyes of Bigfoot that show up when he repeats a special chant told to him by a native of the Artic Circle. You must watch until you see this guy and his wife camp out on the Tundra and get a glimpse of the glowing eyes of Bigfoot. Then, there's the mass celebration with all of the crew after the sighting. I'm not sure where this group of guys were during the camping trip, perhaps two miles away, behind a ridge with red lenses in their flashlights popping up over the ridge with a piece of square cardboard.
So, from the Arizona desert to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, all the way to the Artic Circle, the poor guy ends up back in Oregon (I think) at a beaver pond where his extraordinary tracking skills failed him during his first sighting of Bigfoot. He sets up a blind and waits - lo and behold, Bigfoot shows up with a young friend. The Bigfeet friends splash around in the water, harvest some swamp grass and the camera cuts to a raccoon. A raccoon? Really? If I was making a Bigfoot film and ended up in the same place that I started after postulating about the migration of Bigfoot, elk mating habits and trekking around the Tundra, my whole film would be of the shots I got hiding in a duck blind in a beaver pond, spying on two Bigfoot creatures. But, noooo, cut to the raccoon so that you can show that Bigfoot is a benevolent forest creature that is probably a vegetarian that sometimes might eat fish.
In all, this movie has not dissuaded me in my belief that there is possibly an undiscovered bipedal mammal that has yet to be discovered. It's an entertaining film for sure, the dead squirrel scene notwithstanding.

I am intrigued by the idea of Bigfoot, and with all the recent finds of ancient unknown species of hominids, you do have to wonder if an ancient branch of the hominid family did survive and still exists in the vast unknown wilds.  For as old as this film is, it is so much more reasonable than some of the more recent ones.  Lots of the film is very blurry, because it is so old, but still more believable because this was made before computers could photo shop anything.  I found it intriguing and very well done for the era and a fun adventure of an experienced tracker who has his life changed by a sighting of something he never thought existed.

For those of you who never experienced the TV show ""Wild Kingdom"" from the late 60's, it was a weekly show about things like lions mating, baboon hygiene, and other very exciting nature topics set mostly in Africa. The narrator of this film (faded and fuzzy) was trying to convince himself of his story throughout. I think he was off of his Thorazine drip for too long. Sorry, this is all to say simply don't waste your time on this.

With that being said, I watched this film as a child and to watch it as an adult is somewhat nostalgic.  The film looks like it was created using a k-mart handheld camera.  The narration is entertaining, if not believable, and is good to have as background noise.  Bottom line, if you are looking for a corny, fake documentary, that for some reason is actually entertaining (probably because the narrator tried to make it believable) give this one a try.

2806381,1,B000OYR8BQ,"terrible film, was unable to even laugh due to the disturbing violence and cruelty to the squirrels. Knowing filming style from that era, several squirrels where probably used and it wouldnt have even bothered them when they most likely crippled one squirrel to have it pityingly crawl back to its hole to die slowly. one squirrel was killed for show and another would have been used for the crawling shot, the fact it was one of their crew cars that supposedly ran it down shows it was set up, also to use th squirrel that was prancing about bonding with another squirrell is downright disgusting then watch it in dispair try and rescue its partner and then have the crew cripple another one to pretend it was still alive, this film should be be struck of production. filming animal predator upon prey is one thing, but this is film crew killing for the benefit of emotion from the viewer. useless and disgusting. don't buy or watch, complain if you can to amazon and have them take it off and also have production of dvds  stoppped, thankyou. media, artist and filmmaker",1376870400,,1072,4.6421052631578945

2806383,1,B000OYR8BQ,"Possibly--scratch that, definitely-- the most hideous so called ""movie"" I've ever seen.
Shot after shot of injured, dead and tortured animals, all in the name
of a 'tracker' in the western wilderness looking for bigfoot.
We actually see several agonizing minutes of a severly injured squirrel dragging itself into a hole.
For this and many similar shots of animals dead, dying and suffering, by what is obviously the filmaker's own hands, it wins as all time worst most sickening film ever made.

It's told in narration by a guy with a fake folksy cowboy accent.
The grand finale at the end is a man with what must be a ten dollar
gorilla costume crouching by a stream, then standing up and ambling around.
It looks like he pasted some very cheap nylon fur onto his jeans and shirt, and the narrator is excitedly telling us in his fake down homey accent how he finally is capturing a real bigfoot on film.

What is shocking is that this is actually being shown as if it's legitimate film. I felt embarrassed for the guy who made this, thinking he was making a real movie and fooling people with the narrative, accent and gorilla suit.
I kept wondering why it was even being displayed along with real movies. That's as big a mystery as bigfoot.",1329782400,3,1243,4.594594594594595

8187755,3,B000OYR8BQ,"This is the documentary film of Ivan Marx, infamous Bigfoot hoaxer. The film starts off as he is one of us, a doubter. He films wildlife and old VW Bugs which I found to be the interesting part as some of the film looked a bit like stock footage. There is no lack for films of Bigfoot (Bigfeet plural?) who appears in the same costume from California to the Yukon where it migrates to breed as what animal wants to do the dirty in California. There is also footage of Ivan in the woods, which means there is a camera man we haven't seen. The first BF film is of Cripple-foot a BF with a limp. If you look at the legs, it is apparent it is a costume as you can see the material ""flap"" ...someone with thin legs, like a woman, like Ivan's wife we met earlier who is helping Ivan pay for their ranch raising Siamese cats and coyote puppies.
