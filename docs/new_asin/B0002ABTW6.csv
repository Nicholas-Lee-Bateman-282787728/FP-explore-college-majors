8025103,5,B0002ABTW6,I had watched it long time ago; It's a classic kid's tale. I wanted to form part of my personal collection. I received it on time and had no trouble playing it as soon as it arrived.,1521417600,,182,3.945945945945946
8025104,5,B0002ABTW6,"I am so happy I found this gem, and the reviews really helped me make my decision.  The acting is sublime coming from very young girls telling a very difficult tale.  I was astonished at the ending, but realize that our values are anchored by the beliefs programmed into us at a very early age.",1483920000,,294,4.327272727272727

8025107,5,B0002ABTW6,"This movie did really surprise me, the young actresses played very well and you never know what will happen next. The best of course is the end although this is shocking really. After the ""Magic Moment"" i bought this movie and i must say, the mexicans do really create very good movies. Of course i'd also wish a german audio track, but it helped me to have english subtitles available.",1387756800,,386,4.5285714285714285
8025108,5,B0002ABTW6,"The greatest accomplishment of underrated Mexican film director Carlos Enrique Taboada was to contribute horror films that steered away from the campy ""Monster/Vampire VS. Masked Wrestler"" that dominated Mexican cinema from the 1950s on.

Veneno para las hadas, his last film, is probably his best.  (His best known film, though, is the 1960s flick Hasta el viento tiene miedo.) The film is told from the point of view of two girls(you never see the faces of adults, unless they're fantasies) and the plot centers on the relationship between a blonde orphan who, inspired by fairy tales, pretends to be a witch, and a wealthy brunette who believes and falls prey to all her lies.  The few special effects are justifiably cheesy, since they're supposed to be from the point of view of the two girls.

In short, this film is an interesting attempt at psychological horror by a Mexican film director and well worth watching.",1158105600,4,921,4.922580645161291
8025109,4,B0002ABTW6,"It's easy to overlook this this little gem. A Mexican film from 1984, it features two little girls about age 11. It is probably best defined as a psychological thriller.

They meet at a private girls' school when Veronica {the little villain} meets a new student Flavia, naive and inclined to believe the machiavellian Veronica. Veronica fancies herself a wicked witch, and the other students are already on to her. But with Flavia she meets someone who is ignorant of her ways. It helps too that Flavia comes from a wealthy family.

 Through a series of fortutious circumstances, Veronica is increasingly able to convince Flavia that she indeed is in league with the devil. In the end, Veronica's performance rebounds on her.

There is an internal logic to the movie that only plays out at the end.

This is not a major Hollywood production. It was obviously made on a limited budget, and it's special effects are particularly amateurish. But the movie's strenghs out-weigh its financial limitations.

Accept it on its own terms.

8025110,4,B0002ABTW6,"That being said, I LOVE this film.

  The story is about one thing and one thing only: Flavia is a girl whose parents raised her as an atheist, therefore has no knowledge of the supernatural and has no grasp on whats plausible. Moving to a new town she meets Graciela, a girl obsessed with witchcraft and convinces her new friend that she is a witch by taking advantage of systematic circumstances and taking credit for them. Slowly she takes control of Flavia in the way that religion does for many people: Control of their minds through fear of damnation if they don't do as their told.

  Having said that, the film is mostly scene after scene after scene of the two girls playing. The movie has campy moments with awful low-budget special effects that are entertaining. A person with short attention span can get lost watching this film, so you have to pay attention even when you think nothing is happening. Then the last 5 minutes of the film goes toward the unexpected (at least for a juvenile film) and the film becomes a CAMP movie rather than an awful one.

  The cinematography utilizes what I call the ""Muppet Babies"" approach (I know there's probably a real term) which consists of only shots of the children and adults are shot only from the waist down or their backs to the camera. We get the sensation peeking and being at the childs level where adults are our antagonists.

  The film was originally shot and released in 1984 in Mexico, but dissapeared from movie houses soon after. It was commercially unsuccessful and due to the lack of licensing and what was thought of no interest from the public, the film was NEVER re-aired on television or brought out to video until now. This is why many in Mexico have either forgotten about this movie or never knew of its existance, despite having a bit of a cult following. There is a goth band in Mexico called ""Veneno Para Las Hadas"", look for their page on Myspace. It did however, win many awards in 1985 at the Ariels (Mexican Academy Awards). This was however, right in the middle of Mexican cinema's worst period of artistic drought, where on a good year you got 5 nationaly produced films.

  This is a great film for people who LOVE campy horror flicks and art films...but if you're expecting a ""Latin American Cinema Classic"", as this company has marketed this movie, you will be very dissapointed.
