7881352,5,6304882580,"I have this video and pull it out every once in a while to watch. It is the story of a mother duck and the cycle of life taking place in busy, crowded Tokyo. Even amidst the traffic and concrete, life happens. And although the residents are busy with their lives, they do stop and take the time to enjoy the miracle of life that's happened in their city.

The story centers on Chibi, one of the mother duck's brood. There are dangers and joys. And some sadness when rains and an uncovered storm drain threaten the babies safety.

In the end they do what ducks do. They grow. And they leave.

I always hoped that there would be a sequel; that Chibi would return with a mate and raise a family in the palace gardens where he was born. But I guess that never happened.",1242777600,3,765,4.226027397260274
7881353,5,6304882580,"I too was captured by this film for some reason.  I saw it recently while on a trip in Sweden (it was one of the few shows on television that I could understand!)

The story of Cheebee stole my heart.  It's a perfect underdog tale where even the smallest creature can survive with a little help from friends and an amazing amount of courage.  Go Cheebee!",1145577600,4,354,4.318181818181818
7881354,5,6304882580,"Heartwarming, insightful, and unbelievably funny, a Little Duck  is a one hour documentary geared toward children that tells the true story of a mother chick and her 13 offspring.  In the heart of the industrial section of Tokyo, a Mother duck inhabited a man made pond.  For the next few weeks, she raised her little ducklings as the locals became emotionally involved watching them.  There are hysterical moments as Tokyo residents go through extreme lengths making  sure the ducklings could safely pass through raging traffic.  Even the resident policeman is watching out for them.
The second half of the documentary deals with darker elements.  The ducks enter a larger, and more dangerous pond, and not all of them will make it to the end, (most do).  But  even in it's darker moments,  unexpectedly happy surprises abound.  Most of the documentary focuses on the smallest and most timid of the ducklings known as Cheebee.  Despite his fears, the duckling grows up, and finally learns to put his fears aside.  I think it's wonderful documentary for children and adults alike.  I'm a twenty six year old American male, and I love this movie!",982972800,14,1145,4.9267015706806285
