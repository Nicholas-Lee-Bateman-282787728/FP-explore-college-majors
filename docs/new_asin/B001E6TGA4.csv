8296957,5,B001E6TGA4,"I purchased this documentary with the impression that it was going to be ""pro-single"" (just what one needs to hear about when feeling discouraged in their love life). What I found was a nice analysis of why single-dom is on the rise and why sustaining a long term relationship/marriage is increasingly difficult in this day and age. It really allowed for me to decide for myself that I still aspire for a long term relationship, while at the same time helping me realize that it's not the end of the world if it doesn't happen. Excellent use of time and was worth the money.",1238198400,6,574,4.528846153846154
8296958,5,B001E6TGA4,"Finally, a film that deals with being single in a real and intelligent way. It's entertaining and informative about the ever changing landscape of our culture from couple-dom to single-dom. It confirms what most of us have known but have been afraid to shout out. It's not only ok to be single but being single can be just as fullfilling and rewarding as being in a relationship!",1223164800,4,379,4.6716417910447765
8296959,5,B001E6TGA4,"I am a fan of the documentary and this film is both entertaining and enlightening. The film  deals with aspects of the single life style here and in the U.K., but gives facts and figures of all relationships. I originally learned of the film watching a morning television show called Mike and Juliette, I am surprised Oprah has not picked up on this theme. I thought the film was really well done, and I loved the sound track, I was particularly  impressed with several of the artist; Elza, and Sera Buras
 I have researched the producers and have not found any other films, was this there first project together, if so I can't wait for more.",1222905600,,642,4.517241379310345
8296960,5,B001E6TGA4,"I really enjoyed this film. Whether you're single or married, widowed or divorced, you will see yourself in this well-made documentary. The game certainly has changed and for many who are staying single longer or not marrying at all, it's reassuring to know many of us are experiencing the same thrills of victory and agonies of defeat.

But, best of all, it's heartening to know what really matters is how happy you are with your life, whether single or coupled. This film leaves you illuminated and inspired to live your life on your terms.",1222819200,3,542,4.76595744680851
8296961,5,B001E6TGA4,"A MUST see! Single or coupled....you will relate. Brilliant documentary for our times. Not surprisingly, the film captures the challenges of the 'unattached' and the many choices we now have. Something we have long been waiting to see. Great music too..an extra bonus. Once again, BRAVO!",1222819200,2,287,5.260869565217392
8296962,5,B001E6TGA4,"a film that confronts the ridiculous stigma that implies that unmarried people are somehow lacking a mate or unable to mate.  Really - it's been more than 30 years since Mary Tyler Moore set up house in that kicky apartment in Minneapolis. Have we made no progress?!

Cheers to this documentary that refuses to give us teen-like tips on ""how to find a mate."" Instead, it gloriously reminds the world to banish the singles table at weddings and celebrations.  It denounces the universal question of ""Gee, why are you single?""  I think this is the first generation that's ready to ask ""Hmm, why should I get married?""

Singles is a timely and refreshing eye-opener.  It's a reminder that the world is changing and it's time for the perspective of single life to change too - from social conversation to marketing promotions.  (eg, Why are singles still paying for double rooms on vacations?)",1222819200,3,889,4.809210526315789
