3146354,5,B0015OKWKS,"That was once an observation about my preferences in movies, that I enjoyed stories that seemed like they might happen to you, could happen, and were just about nothing really. And after spending the afternoon in Camarillo, CA in an art theater of very senior citizens in audience I think many felt it might happen too, because they gave a nice small gentle applause.
Even with their canes, assistants and wheelchair gear (noted to me by my companion holding up  my poorly performing leg so I could hobble in) we were an older crew.

What was the movie? Hum. The story of a man, a jazz piano commercial jingle writer, coping with a pressure sounding job nightmare in a digitizing universe, going to London to see his daughter be married. His name is Harvey Shine, that is interesting because of course he is just Dustin Hoffman reprising himself as a romantic duffer, struggling with the job, with the marriage of a daughter he's lost to a divorce long ago, as she folded into her mother's remarriage. He's put up at a hotel, away from the entire family, apart, odd wheel. It carries so well those outsider feelings of this man, that has a daughter who doesn't seem to know him too well, that he later will say in a conversation in the film she always seemed a bit embarrassed by him, as he notes he had a child within something that never was quite right. Never right. It took a toll, one he obviously regrets,it hurts,  but he knows another price had to be paid by his child who has almost become another man's child. Hard, impossible to verbalize. We miss in life on many things.  In a series of hits and misses he then at this same time runs into Emma Thompson, oops Kate Walker I think, working for the airline, struggling with her own anxieties about her own scene of awkwardly attempting meeting someone, with nervous apprehension-anxieties over this. And as it seems to happen sometimes, he rebuffs her (ironically on his plane flight he was rebuffed by a passenger not interested in his chat) turns from her and some airline survey, only later to find himself after a horrible day running back into her at the airport as he fails to get the plane and get out of there to an essential work meeting. And finding a rapport then, a shift in the mind and heart, I think he can see her now. See her. After he's lost enough to understand when he is found.
Or has found. Seeing.

It reminded me somehow of years ago when I was in my early twenties. Just a vague familiarity.  A Cuban man drove me from the airport to a hotel down close to the Modern. A nice cabbie that talked and calmed a very fear-filled kid trying to figure out her life. Just a kind man. That's all. I was very nervous, unsure where I was, he was a great help, and I must have just told him I was afraid of not having too much money so I couldn't afford to pay more than thirty dollars. I was afraid of being overcharged. I know he didn't do that, my funds were so limited. I told him that. And I tipped him. I think he helped me get a room at a place I could afford. There is a point. A few days later I ran into him at Central Park at a festival. He and I just happily chatted like friends as he played some gaming thing on a day I needed to feel safer. It's a small world but this movie reminds me of how sometimes life hugs you in a very small corner. It allows you to listen to the tune played on the jazz piano. It gives you the blessing of a nice glass of rose.( I cannot figure out the accent on that e)  And someone might actually wait for you to finish your class, as this new acquaintance does for Kate, or even walks with you all night or takes the risk to follow where someone leads. Or takes a hand or asks a favor.

Actually I've read the plot summarized here and at on-line movie sites ten times or more, when debating whether or not to risk my going out walking with such serious problems going on underfoot, so it isn't what I'd want to say-another synopsis. It wouldn't get it anyway. He goes to the wedding, is hurt by being replaced by the step dad told by the daughter in walking her down the aisle, meets this interesting, wary and lovely woman, loses his job, takes a risk, suffers a arrhythmia, almost misses a chance that he needs, she needs. And then there is her mom, calmly wondering if the neighbor is smoking bodies in the shed.
It's a little cozy movie about the lovely warmth of holding a hand and strolling into the life of another, because it's just righter than retreat.

I loved the littlest things. That there is some very old man in her writing class reading his sexual passages, that Harvey collapses when made to walk the kazillion flights of stairs at his hotel in London, both elevators off, that Emma Thompson wears this lovely silk lined raincoat so beautifully, that he goes to the pre wedding dinner with a white linen suit, crumpled with the tag not removed by the store, you know those inky ones, that they allow us to feel all the awkward staring discomfort, that Kate rolls up a little jacket or sweater to put under a child's head when they are belatedly seated at a child's table after the wedding at the reception. That he plays her a tune on the piano and asks her to stay, calming her discomfort knowing his own. That he gives her, and she him, the benefit of the doubt. That Kate goes to the rail with such anxiety when he tells her he's there, going to be there, why he missed her, and she sits and looks and admits to all the real fear of being hurt.

And he just absorbs that, and says he won't let her down.

I wish I could write to do it justice. It's small and it's everything. Lovely film.",1240012800,17,5625,4.302171860245514
3146355,3,B0015OKWKS,"On any list of proposed pairings for a romantic comedy, would you expect to see Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson? No, probably not. But&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Chance-Harvey/dp/B0015OKWKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Chance Harvey</a>&nbsp;puts these troupers together in London and the results are a bit surprising. The story: New York jingle-writer Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is on his last legs in a job that's passing him by, and he tears himself away from the daily crisis to attend his daughter's wedding in London. Long divorced, Harvey hasn't been close to his daughter and he's very much on the outside among the wedding party. His daughter has asked her step-father (James Brolin) to give her away. Harvey bags the reception, misses a plane home, gets fired over the phone, and takes refuge in a pub.

Meanwhile Kate Walker (Thompson) is cruising toward spinsterhood, at her quirky mother's beck and call; she has bagged a bad blind date and is--oh, can you guess?--taking refuge in the same pub. Overture, rebuff, repeat.

These two lonely souls somehow, in spite of a script full of lame repartee, get together and tell their stories. Kate is horrified that Harvey is missing his daughter's reception and insists that he attend. He tows her along. Harvey, although seated at the children's table, rises to the occasion and all is happy.

Well, it's not quite that simple, but nearly. The lead actors give their usual excellent performances but the romantic tension just isn't there. Writer/director Joel Hopkins delivers a movie that's pleasant enough but not memorable, except for the recurring scenes in which Kate's mother spies on her new neighbor of whom she is highly suspicious. Don't leave before the credits roll, or you will miss the final scene in this play-within-a-play.

This was not a terrible way to spend ninety minutes on an airplane, but it's not a movie I'd yearn to see again; just a little too wordy and lacking in plausibility. But I WOULD like to watch the wedding scene one more time, to find out if my brain at sea level would once again channel ""The Graduate"" while watching Dustin Hoffman at his daughter's wedding.

3146356,5,B0015OKWKS,"Beautifully acted, a well crafted story and film, Last Chance Harvey may well become a classic of its time.

Other reviews will give you the bare bones of this story. Many will be somewhat disappointed. There are no crash, bang, wallops, no magical special effects, no deaths, no wild sex scenes, and no wacky out-of-this-world crazy characters. The emotions of Last Chance Harvey lie subtly between the lines, behind the faade; in the traditions of English and French literary cinema. Last Chance Harvey comes from the stable of such classics as Notting Hill, which successfully cross over to an American audience. After the 'B' movie disaster films of Hoffman's mid-life career, it is good to see Dustin back, again, in a character deserving of his acting skill.

Look for instance at the gentle nostalgia. 'Hello lamppost what you knowing?' Last Chance Harvey gently acts the feelings of many baby-boomers who missed or got emotionally screwed the liberated 60's and now face their last chance of finding happiness in their golden years. Watch the flower growing. Last Chance Harvey is a maturely romantic comedy. Dig out the gem of Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Waters.' If you are not old enough to do that, then read on and learn to avoid the mistakes of your generation.

Every generation repeats the patterns and mistakes of the past. Men sell their creative souls to the commercial machine. Dustin Hoffman's character dreamt of being a jazz pianist but instead spent a life writing advertising jingles. The kind of music John Lennon disparagingly described as 'musac'. Competing in a stressful demanding world,  such men neglect the relationships that are most important to all. Their children. Last Chance Harvey stands as a judgement by a generation on the `gift' of easy divorce. Sacrifices made for a career, only to find oneself dumped on the scrap heap of ageism.

Emma Thompson's character is a spinster whose life is ruled by a demanding dependent mother. Thompson's mother is a cancer survivor crippled by the psychological effects of impending death. Seeing death everywhere, she is fearful of time apart from her daughter.

Surely in this age, intelligent independent women are liberated from such self-sacrifice. Surely there are treatments, places to care, for the aged? Reality is different, even today. Can any generation abandon its parents?

Sometimes the chains of dependency are self-imposed. Thompson's character is just as dependent on her mother. It protects her from repeating the greatest mistake of her life.

Last Chance Harvey is story of loss. Loss of loved ones, of unborn children; loss of career; self-concept; the loss of innocence, loss of the romantic dreams of adolescence, and the loss of a caring society. `Don't leave me here', is Dustin's unspoken plea to a perfect stranger. Not in this place in life.

In the days of instant gratification, uncontrolled consumption, thoughtless greed and instant celebrity, Last Chance Harvey even laments the loss of skills and the pleasure of craft. The writer's group is not just a device to create anxiety in the separation of characters falling in love; it is also a device to illustrate a theme. A world that thinks creativity exists without the hard earned skills of craft.

In these recessionary days, when so many dreams are shattered, Last Chance Harvey tells us all there is still a chance if only we get our priorities right.

Last Chance Harvey may not make you shed a tear, but it will give you hope. The hope we all need to believe we will see our way out of the gloom and despondency of recession. For that reason, Last Chance Harvey may become a classic of its time. And Emma Thompson continues to show she is one of the greatest English actresses of our time.

3146357,4,B0015OKWKS,"By no means do I damn with faint praise when suggesting that this is a ""small"" film. Rather, only to suggest that it covers a brief period of time (a few days), in a single setting (London), focuses primarily on only two characters, and there few plot developments. Briefly, Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is employed by an advertising agency in Manhattan as a jingle writer when we are introduced to him. Almost immediately we sense that he is dissatisfied with both his career (he would prefer to earn a living as a jazz composer and performer) and with the current state of his life (he is divorced and apparently alienated from his adult daughter, Susan, who is about to be married in London). The title refers to both situations: Charley is advised by his boss Marvin (Richard Schiff who played the character Toby Ziegler on the television program, The West Wing) that his job is in jeopardy. After a very brief encounter upon arrival at Heathrow Airport with Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) seeking to obtain travel information from passengers, Harvey is saddened to learn from Susan (Liane Balaban) that she has decided that her stepfather Brian (James Brolin) will accompany her down the aisle. Of course, Harvey encounters Kate again and then....

The acting is outstanding. The setting is especially appropriate for what happens to a troubled New Yorker, among strangers in a strange city, at a time when he is running out of options in all areas of his life. Kate has concerns of her own but seems less troubled, probably because she fulfills at least some needs by comforting and reassuring her mother Maggie Walker (Eileen Atkins) who calls her constantly throughout the day (and evening), concerned about trivial matters. We know almost nothing else about Kate's private life, other than the absence of romance and few (if any) chances of finding it. She clearly does not wish to be hurt and is sensibly reluctant to become involved with anyone, even a stranger who is clearly unhappy, feels rejected, and in need of attention and kindness.

Five Star ratings of films should be reserved for ""classics"" and that is especially true of romantic comedies such as It Happened One Night, Little Shop Around the Corner, Sleepless in Seattle, and You've Got Mail. Last Chance Harvey is not in their class. However, I think Hoffman and Thompson are not only superb but have charming chemistry, the film is well-made, respectful of awkward adult situations with potentially serious consequences, and arrives at its happy ending with a pleasing plausibility.",1237507200,32,2557,4.958041958041958
3146358,2,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a tale of redemption on many levels.  Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is about to lose his job in advertising to a younger hand,  he's also about to lose his daughter Susan (Liane Balaban) to her new husband, and he's getting close to losing himself as well.

It's kismet that he meets Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a British woman in similar circumstances.  And it's literally his third chance to do so that he recognizes her.

They strike up a friendship despite their mutual angst and Kate helps Harvey by attending Susan's wedding reception.  This is the story that the film's trying to tell. I honestly can't say why they didn't quite score a hit with it. I love both Thompson and Hoffman and I wanted to like this pairing, but nothing about the two of them together really made me think they were a couple at all.  Perhaps if they played this as more of a British comedy than an American and created more tension between the two of them, it might have worked better.

The subplot, Kate's senior Mom (Eileen Atkins) who drives Kate crazy by calling dozens of times a day, had me riveted to the screen each time she came on. This woman's obsession with her new Polish neighbor who she watches out her back window is fascinating. The Easter Egg at the end of the credits showing the two of them finally meeting was worth sitting through hte whole film listening to the two senior guys behind me snoring. This is the plot I wished they'd pursued and it's the funniest part of the whole film.

Like the far superior ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Joel Hopkins` ""Last Chance Harvey"" is that rare movie romance in which the main characters have less time ahead of them than they have behind them.  This means that they come loaded down with far more serious baggage than their whippersnapper counterparts in most such stories.

Harvey's burden is that he's a songwriter who's pretty much hit the bottom-of-the-barrel in his professional life - he writes jingles for television commercials - and who's long since given up his dream of ever becoming a world-class jazz pianist.  He's also a failure as a parent, finding himself all but estranged from his twenty-something daughter who so prefers her stepfather to her real father that she's chosen the former to walk her down the aisle at her wedding.  Kate is an employee at Heathrow Airport who spends most of her free time taking care of her high maintenance aging mother and being roped into going on pathetic blind dates that invariably leave her feeling unfulfilled, crushed and vulnerable.  It is when Harvey travels to London to attend his daughter's wedding - where he is treated like a virtual outcast - that his and Kate's paths eventually cross.  Discouraged and lonely, Harvey and Kate begin a tentative friendship that promises to bloom into a full-fledged romance by the end of the picture.

Since love stories centered around later-life couples are indeed such an anomaly, it becomes doubly sad to have to report that ""Last Chance Harvey"" turns out to be a decidedly innocuous, low-wattage affair overall.  Although the movie runs for a scant ninety minutes, literally a full half hour passes before Harvey and Kate share any real screen time together.  This means that the entire romance has to be crammed into a mere hour's worth of time, a feat that no actors - not even two of the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson - could reasonably be expected to pull off.  The script deserves credit for not over-dramatizing its scenes and for being willing to allow the romance to unfold without a great deal of hoopla and fanfare.  But the result, paradoxically, is that this very lack of urgency and energy winds up draining much of the life out of the film.

Lucky for us, we do have two old pros like Hoffman and Thompson to make the movie seem better than it is - though it's a bit farfetched to try to pass the lovely and witty Thompson off as a woman who can't land herself a man.  It's also a bit unfortunate that the final scenes begin to seem like ""The Graduate: Forty Years Later,"" as a now much older Hoffman races around the city trying to get himself back in the good graces of the woman he loves.

Hoffman and Thompson make for an inspired pairing, but beyond their performances, ""Last Chance Harvey"" evaporates from memory not too long after we've seen it.",1233100800,5,2844,4.740365111561866
3146360,4,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) is a mess. Fearful he is about to lose his job, he rushes to the airport to catch a plane to London; his daughter is getting married to her fianc&eacute;e and he can't miss the wedding, his relationship with his daughter is already strained to the point of bursting. When he arrives, he realizes he has been relegated to 'Guest' status and his cell phone continues to ring at inopportune times. But the real blow comes when his daughter announces her step-dad (James Brolin) will give her away. Harvey can't stand it and leaves the wedding before the reception. Returning to Heathrow to miss his flight, he sits down in an airport bar and finds Kate (Emma Thompson), an airport employee enjoying a glass of wine, her nose buried in a new paperback. They strike up a reluctant conversation and Harvey is intrigued. It takes a while, but Kate is just as intrigued and they start to talk and walk around London.

""Last Chance Harvey"", written and directed by Joel Hopkins, is a charming romance, a good showcase for the talents of the two leads and a very, very imperfect film saved only by Hoffman and Thompson. Ultimately, it is a nice little bit of fluff that you will no doubt forget. You'll have one of those conversations in a few months. ""Did you see that film with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson?"" ""No, which one? ""Love, Actually""?"" ""No, Hoffman wasn't in that. The other one.""

The saving grace of the film are the performances from Hoffman and Thompson. I read that both insisted there be limited rehearsals, allowing for the characters to improvise and seem even more natural. Hoffman plays Harvey, a real mess of a guy who is about to lose his job and his daughter and makes a real botched effort trying to save his relationship with both. He rushes to London for her wedding, making the return flight for two days later. When he tells his daughter he will miss the reception, it seems to be the final straw and she drops a bombshell on him. Her step-dad will give her away. When she tells Harvey this, you can tell she is heartbroken because her relationship with her dad is so strained. When he hears the news, you can almost see Harvey's heart break, as Hoffman's face registers a wave of emotion, the feelings briefly flashing across his face.

As soon as the wedding is over, he bolts, rushing back to Heathrow, but he also seems relieved to be away from the crushing emotional memories. When he realizes he has missed his flight, he finds himself in a weird purgatory; he can't do anything about his job and doesn't feel like doing anything about his daughter and the disconnect from her life. He slumps into an airport bar and orders a drink. Airport employee Kate (Emma Thompson) is enjoying a meal after her shift and the two begin talking. Kate, younger than Harvey, is intrigued by the American and he offers to walk with her to her next appointment.

Let's backtrack a bit and look at Kate's life for a few moments. She works at Heathrow, managing a group of women who greet incoming passengers and get statistical information for them. Each of the women she works with desperately wants her to find a companion, so much so that one of them asks her to go out on a blind date. She and her boyfriend will be there, so she doesn't have anything to worry about. But Kate's life, and her love life in particular, are hampered by her mom (Eileen Atkins), a needy single woman who seems to have her finger poised above speed dial at all times. She calls Kate constantly and interrupts many conversations she has with others, including potential mates. The blind date doesn't go well and Kate becomes particularly unhappy. But she puts on a stiff upper lip and goes to work and continues to deal with her mom, bottling up her emotions and pushing on.

What makes this work, and elevates the material above television movie status, are the performances from the two leads. Both Hoffman and Thompson are such good actors that when they receive material like this, they know how to make every moment seem real and believable. Hoffman really seems to lose himself inn the role and we see fifty years of Harvey's life factor into every conversation and decision he has and makes throughout the film. When he arrives in London and takes a taxi to the hotel, he calls his daughter. ""Where are all of you?"" ""Oh. Your mom rented a house."" ""No, I'm OK. I'll be fine here."" We don't need to hear the other side of the conversation to see all of the pain and conflict Harvey experiences or to understand the thoughts racing through his head as he tries to make his daughter feel OK. Why couldn't your mom put her feelings aside for a few days and include me in this momentous part of your life? Why couldn't you say something about it? But I love you too much to make a fuss and will stay put here at the hotel.

In every scene, Hoffman does similar things with Harvey, revealing new things about him, his relationship with his ex and his daughter, about his life. Each of these revelations is revealed through facial expressions, or the lack of, brief little looks, his eyes, and body language. What is really interesting about this character is that Hoffman reveals so much by contradicting what Harvey is saying with little movements, or ticks, or gestures that tell us he is trying to make everyone else feel OK and he doesn't care about his feelings and wants his daughter to think everything is OK.

Thompson is Hoffman's equal and she brings as much depth and interest to her character, Kate. We get the sense there is great pain in Kate because her ever present smile seems greatly strained, ready to plaster a smile across her face to keep her mom from asking too many questions and to keep her co-workers and friends from getting too involved in her life.

When Kate and Harvey meet, each seems to loosen a little bit and Kate's defenses seem to crumble. She is intrigued by the forward American and agrees to walk with him. Each time she tries to pull away, he insists that they continue walking or talking and she gives in. What makes this so poignant is that she doesn't really put up a fight. She is merely protesting for appearances sake.

As they walk and talk, Kate learns a lot about Harvey, and vice versa, and what brought him to this stage. She asks ""Is the reception still going on?"" And he immediately decides to ask her to go. As they spend more and more time together, they realize the unconventional aspects of their relationship, everything that should make it not work, are the reasons they are each intrigued by the budding relationship.

It is really a delight to watch two actors, each so accomplished in their craft, at the top of their skills, create two people who are so intrigued by one another.

There is a subplot involving Kate's mom (Eileen Atkins), which seems wasted. She is a big part of Kate's life and calls her on a constant basis. Then, she begins to have suspicions about a new neighbor. These moments seem to point to a fairly funny subplot. When that part of the story fails to payoff, you have to wonder what was the point in investing so much time in this character. It seems misleading somehow.

And the film has a very small scope. This isn't a bad thing, in and of itself, but when you begin to experience the depth of Hoffman and Thompson's performances, you begin to hope for more. Eileen Atkins' character promises something funny, but when this fails to materialize, what else is there? Because so much of the film concentrates on the two characters, it begins to feel like a film adapted from a play. We have seen films adapted from plays before. Some seem better than the play because they take advantage of the new medium, film, and present a story more expansive than the original material. And others seem too restricted by the source material, presenting many dialogues between two or three characters, never leaving the confines of a 'stage'. When a film that wasn't based on a play seems like it was, that is a problem.

And this problem makes the otherwise enjoyable ""Last Chance Harvey"" problematic.",1232841600,,8096,4.586731167933656
3146361,4,B0015OKWKS,"I, too, went to a pre-release screening of this movie.  Nobody would say this is a great or classic romance movie, nor would anyone say it is particularly innovative.  However, it does have a few qualities in its favor.  I don't see why it is rated PG-13 because there is refreshingly little bad language, and the closest to a sex scene is a short kiss in a public park.  For 'traditional values' families this should be a big plus.  It is almost a relief to see a movie where the couple merely agrees to keep seeing each other rather than running to the nearest hotel for sex.  One scene that should appeal greatly to Roman Catholics and most Protestants is a scene where Kate laments for having had an abortion while still in university.  How often have you seen that in a modern movie?

If you want to see a classic romance or a life-changing movie, this is probably not a good choice.  However, if you would like to spend a pleasant ninety minutes for entertainment that only occasionally, and then mildly, contravenes traditional family or religious values, then you probably won't be disappointed.  A romance this wholesome doesn't come along too often these days.",1231718400,,1170,4.663414634146341
3146362,4,B0015OKWKS,"Watching ""Last Chance Harvey,"" I began to think about other such films and realized that I usually referred to them in my reviews as classic romantic comedies. But what exactly do I mean when I say that? In all likelihood, I mean that readers should go easy on the film because we're used to those movies following a very specific formula, and never mind the fact that they're contrived and clich. I could very well call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy, because goodness knows it adheres to a tried and true structure. In spite of that, this is the one romantic comedy of 2008 that works the best, in large part because of stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson; whereas other filmmakers would cast young, energetic actors in a story about sex, writer/director Joel Hopkins has cast two older actors in a story is about love. Because they're more experienced, they actually bring something to the table. They seem genuine as people.

But more importantly, they have chemistry, not necessarily as lovers but definitely as companions. In other words, it seems plausible that such people could meet in real life and fall in love. Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer from New York who always wanted to be a jazz pianist. It was easy for me to empathize with him, a somber, soft-spoken man who always feels ignored in a large crowd. Maybe there's a part of him that wanted it that way; he's been known to embarrass himself and those closest to him, so at a certain point, it's better to just stay out of the way. He openly admits that he wasn't the greatest father or husband, and while there's no hostility between him or his daughter and ex-wife, there is a quiet yet prominent sense of disappointment on all accounts. And now, no one at his music company seems to be taking him seriously. More to the point, he's on the verge of losing his job.

When Harvey flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding, he meets a Heathrow employee named Kate Walker (Thompson), who, as it turns out, is stuck in her own emotional rut. She says she would like nothing more than to meet someone and start a relationship, but since she's been let down so many times, she may be getting used to it. Later on in the film, she admits that being disappointed is more comfortable that being hurt. Much like Harvey, she also feels ignored in crowds, as when she's on a blind date that starts off well but ends up as a social gathering that leaves her off in the sidelines. Her only social outlets are her coworkers and her mother (Eileen Atkins), an interesting character herself; she calls Kate constantly, pretty much to the point of insanity, and she seems to think her Polish next-door neighbor is a mass murderer who burns his victims in a large barbecue shed.

Harvey and Kate spend a wonderful afternoon together, and this is despite the fact that they don't know very much about each other. We don't know if a love is developing at this point, but it's clear that a friendship is. While a bit quiet and reserved, Harvey is kind towards Kate, and he seems genuinely interested in what she has to say. Kate is willing to go along with it, although her nervous smiles and hesitant laughter suggest that she has absolutely no idea why any of this is happening. From out of nowhere comes a charming American man, and even though he has a lot of emotional baggage, there's the sense that she's interested in helping him deal with it. Most likely, that's because she has baggage of her own; after convincing her to join him at his daughter's wedding reception, there comes a point when she feels exactly the same as she did the night of her blind date. It's up to Harvey to make her feel like she can be a part of the crowd.

There are some interesting moments between Harvey and his daughter, Susan (Liane Balaban). Even though they love each other in the strictest sense, they are more good friends than they are father and daughter, which is why she wants her stepfather, Brian (James Brolin), to give her away at the wedding. Harvey is understandably hurt, but he can't stay mad at Brian forever; after all, he did take over for Harvey when his marriage failed, giving Susan the stability and attention she needed. This would be a tiresome story were Brian made to be vindictive and hostile. Thankfully, he isn't--he's decent and accommodating, a fact Harvey most likely has trouble accepting. There are few things worse than disliking someone without having a reason.

So yes, I guess I can call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy. But that doesn't automatically make it a bad movie. What really made it work well was the thoughtful relationship between Harvey and Kate, which isn't based on physical attraction so much as it's based on the need to be loved. We don't get too much of that in romantic comedies these days. Even the entertaining ""Definitely, Maybe"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl"" were only committed to catering to younger audiences, which is a shame because the filmmakers missed some great opportunities to develop the characters at a more mature level. ""Last Chance Harvey"" gives its characters some degree of believability, and this is in spite of the story's formulaic elements. I greatly enjoyed this film, and I'm sure most audiences will also.",1230681600,98,5282,4.669172932330827

It is an interesting story that begins to unravel from one third of the way into filming....it contemplates the prospect of love with two individuals: a man and a woman who seem to be lost in the anguish of love, and slightly heartbroken in desire of affection. But it is a light and pleasant comedy that is set in the fast-paced location of London.

I admire Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson who co-star together in a very fine and well crafted story, in a light hearted romance that will eventually fall under the old formula of... boy meets girl - boy losses girl  and then again....

A fine film indeed  Dustin Hoffman is the very star, but sometimes wobbles in character in our thoughts Does he have solvency to be in a classy style to pursue his romance in London... There is some doubt because there are niggles of worry about his personal wealth in stability of his present day employment as a jingles composer?

I actually think that Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as the American....as an afterthought of actor replacements, I rather think that Richard Gere, for example, would be too soppy, or that Al Pacino too electrifying and magnetic in character of the American?

I have not extended into plot or story detail as the film intrigues me in the knowledge that life is usually more upbeat with distractions to really soul search the heart without being too sad  it is worth viewing....

  *********

I am surprised that Dustin Hoffman starred perhaps he wanted to have fun in London -he looked pretty cool - playing an American in attendance to his daughters wedding....a rich American or perhaps a struggling one -once again, he had not secured a new contract for his jingles music? Emma Thompson was delightful as always but looking a bit weary of life she is a good actress! Im sure she wanted to follow Dustin Hoffmans star attraction to join him in lead role?

Both characters - I think - were in the same public bar when Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are portrayed separately in the opening film sequences. They are in character a bit distraught of life and love....they never get to meet together until later on - and this is what I truly liked about the film  whether or not they would ever meet ...or was it to be an interesting story of two separate lives?

  *********

This is a lovely and light hearted reflection of love in contrast of the loneliness of London without the support of connection...The script is enough to be equally intelligent to life. I greatly admire Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson for taking on their roles of this light comedy.

It may be a light comedy of romantic love but it enhances the desire to be together when circumstances dictate, and affect the mental control of anguish in a lonely existence...it is well scripted, and works from an intelligent script that is beyond my own powers in anticipation of writing one myself? Well Done",1467244800,,2970,4.657088122605364

3146382,4,B0015OKWKS,"I bought this DVD from the bargain bin when a chain video store closed its doors.  It sat on my television stand for several years before I decided to watch it.  Ironically, I read the screenplay and used a number of scenes for the acting for the camera scene study class I teach at the college.  I think I was discouraged to watch by the number of calamities that befall the hapless character of Harvey Shine in the first part of the film.  What I found as I watched was that I really fell in love with these two characters played Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson as the British Kate Walker.  The film is a delightful romantic journey of the two.  It shows how well deserved were the Golden Globe nominations for each of the two leads.  The supporting characters are also delightful.  Eileen Atkins who was in ""Cold Mountain"" does a great job as Kate's mother, bothered by the handyman new neighbor next door.  As mother Maggie, Atkins has a knack to always intrude on Kate at the most awkward moments.  Kathy Baker who I most remember as Joe's mother on one of my favorite TV series, ""Medium,"" plays Harvey's ex who seems to smugly belittle him at every turn.  I found the DVD extras to be tremendously informative.  It talks about how the project was created, how Dustin and Emma had previously worked together but with limited screen time, and how the great chemistry they felt from that experience translated well to ""Last Chance Harvey.""  This was Joel Hopkins' second film; and he let the actors improvise to a great extent, which gives the film a real spark and intense truthfulness in performance.  This is an excellent romantic film I'm sure to pull out on many rainy days in the future.  Enjoy!",1425859200,,1705,4.5625

Don't believe it! There is a subtle look here at what a middle aged romance should be vs what many people think it will be, the fears that go with taking the plunge and the courage it takes to 'make the leap' after being burned in previous relationships.

Harvey and Kate meet accidentally - twice - and the second time is a charm.  He is visiting from America and she is a resident Brit.  They walk, they talk, they laugh and ultimately reveal some deeply painful facts about themselves and their lives. (Anyone with emotional scars will be able to relate to both these individuals.)

You will laugh and cry while watching this movie.

3146420,5,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey is a psychologically savvy romantic comedy about Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) and Kate (Emma Thompson).  Harvey, a would-be jazz musician who writes commercial jingles, is being replaced by young techies.  He arrives in London for his daughter's wedding to learn that she has asked her stepfather to give her away.  Kate lives close to her clinging mother and has a job conducting surveys at Heathrow airport.  She seems too old to hang out with the trendy bar crowd but too young to give up on the singles scene altogether.  There's nothing wrong with Harvey or Kate; they just don't belong where they are.  But belong together they do, even though, as in most romantic comedies, it is not easy to get them together.  But with Hoffman and Thompson the ride is deliciously sublime.  Give these two a decent script (and this one is good enough) and they will break your heart.  (And then warmly put it back together.)",1348704000,,930,4.7625

3146422,2,B0015OKWKS,"2.5 Stars. I really wanted to like this film, and there were times when I thought Joel Hopkins (the writer and director) was going to let me. When the film focuses on Hoffman and Thompson (both in fine form), their budding friendship and the time they spend together, then it is charming and appealing. Unfortunately, there are too many awkward and embarrassing moments during the first 30 minutes before they meet, and there are too many subplots: the one involving the mother and her suspicions about her neighbor is totally extraneous. The wonderful Eileen Atkins is completely wasted. In fact, the film-makers could have gotten the point across quite well--a dependent relative stifling a child--using the device of a frequent cell phone caller who is never seen. Why not just let these two wonderful actors do what they do best - act out their initial tentativeness and the increasing ease they find with each other as they spend more time together. We should be hearing what they have to say to each other, but instead, too often the camera pans away from them, where it should be, and the focus switches to their surroundings. Not a major disappointment, but a disappointment nevertheless.",1342742400,,1196,4.925742574257426
3146423,3,B0015OKWKS,"""I think I'm more comfortable with being disappointed. I think I'm angry at you for trying to take that away."" - Emma Thompson

Risk taking was easily accessible in our youth because stocking everything on the table didn't feel like much of a risk. It was affordable too, perhaps because we hadn't yet piled our chips high. But that's what happens as we age. Responsibilities wield in, we succumb to formula, acquire empires, and a risk feels like, well, a risk.

That's where Harvey comes in. While ultimately successful in his once-aspiring career, he's taken his as far as it will go. Fast forward to his daughter Susan's London wedding to a fianc&eacute; whom Harvey's never met and an x-wife with a husband, who's taken his seat as Susan's new go-to father. And then there's Kate, a middle-aged woman working in an international airport, of all ironic places, but has never actually aspired to vigor. Life, it seems, has finally passed them by.

The problem here is two mismatched extremes. Harvey's disappointed with life while Kate is comfortable with disappointment. Last Chance Harvey reminds us that the universe will prod us beyond our stagnant spirit into new daring opportunities, but only to a point. Eventually we have to close our eyes and jump off the high dive. Chance isn't concerned with what follows.

3146427,3,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is going through a mid-life crisis of sorts.  A younger guy's jingle seems to be the favorite at work and his job is in jeopardy.  His daughter seems to be rejecting him in favor of her handsome stepfather, played by James Brolin.  Harvey also seems to have an issue doing anything right.  If there is such a thing as a non-golden touch, Harvey has it.

Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is not having a mid-life crisis, but neither is her life very exciting.  She is resigned to stability, which does not involve a man, or anyone, it seems.  She even finds her mother annoying.  Perhaps it is better to say that she clings to stability.  Kate appears to fear change because she is afraid of being hurt.

These two people meet when Harvey arrives in London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is asking questions for a survey and Harvey is in no mood for answering questions.  The meeting is hardly auspicious.

Harvey attends his daughter's wedding but misses his flight back to the U.S. because of heavy traffic.  Harvey calls his boss, who fires him.  Harvey heads for an airport bar where he sees Kate.  Harvey apologizes to Kate for his earlier behavior, but his real reason for approaching Kate is that he needs someone to listen to him.  Kate, of course, is completely uninterested in listening to Harvey, another rude, nearly obnoxious traveler.

What follows is a nearly formulaic movie as Kate and Harvey do a relationship dance and try to break from their normal routine.  We could almost write the ending along with the obligatory facial tissue and a marginal sniff.

The best thing this movie has going for it is star horsepower.  Emma Thompson has either won or been nominated for more than 80 awards, including two Oscar wins.  Dustin Hoffman has won or been nominated for more than 70 awards, including two Oscar wins.  The supporting cast includes veterans Kathy Baker, James Brolin and many others.  With all the star horsepower, this movie seems as though it would be a sure-fire winner.  Sadly, it is not.

This movie plods.  Harvey's only charming attribute is the face of Dustin Hoffman, which is insufficient to carry the day.  Emma Thompson's Kate is much more charming and I liked her, but romance between Harvey and Kate is just too improbable.  Even if I suspended belief, I still struggle to see these two getting together.  Even if they do get together, the pace of the movie is so slow that I hardly cared.

I must admit that romantic movies are hardly my favorite.  However, I do enjoy a well-plotted love story.  I loved ""The Graduate,"" ""Love Story,"" ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" and dozens more.  This movie is a vague shadow of those movies.

There are few romantic movies about mature adults in the middle years of their lives.  This movie had a lot going for it, especially great actors and an award-winning director.  Unfortunately, the story seemed to be too far outside the director's experience and it falls flat, even with Hoffman and Thompson adlibbing some of the scenes.  I give this one three stars because there is some chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson and I do like a happy ending.  I am disappointed because this movie could have been so much more.

They meet, they interact, they see the possibility of greater possibilities in their lives.

3146432,4,B0015OKWKS,"I enjoyed Last Chance Harvey for a number of reasons.  For one, the main characters are decent and likeable people; sure they've got flaws, and they've fallen into self-defeating habits in life, but part of the beauty of the movie is how they lift themselves out of self-defeat and even at this point in their lives (middle to late middle aged) find love and contentedness with each other.  The characters inspire each other and gently tug each other out of their loneliness and quiet misery.

I liked the tone and pace of the movie too - the gentle humor, the glimpses we get of England, the chemistry between the characters, who aren't ravishingly beautiful or handsome, but have such lovely smiles, warm eyes, and good chemistry with each other.  As Kate Walker and Harvey Shine, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman work well together, and the scenes where they're on camera together have a special light of their own.

The subplot with Kate's mother (and the mysterious, slightly sinister new neighbor) was a bit too silly and thin, but I did enjoy the part of the movie that dealt with Harvey's relationship with his daughter (and I admit there's one part when I was moved to tears, in a moment when he finally stands up and asserts himself as a father - doing this with grace and genuine feeling, and without rancor at his ex-wife or her husband).  I liked this - that you can have a movie without a real villain, only ordinary people messing up and then trying to repair their mistakes and find some love, closeness and peace in life.",1286841600,,1538,4.636029411764706

He is protrayed as somewhat of a bumbler, who manages to screw things up as he goes along, not royally but fairly significantly.  While in London he meets an airline employee, played by Emma Thompson, who seems to be as out of luck as Hoffman.  There is the inevitable chance meet-up but this and other minor cliche plot steps can be dismissed by the overall mood of the film as well as by Hoffman's acting talent.  Hoffman plays the role of Harvey Shine perfectly, helping the viewer feel both the frustrations and triumphs of his life, and mastefully using facial expressions to convey complex emotions.  There is one particular scene that Hoffman performs brilliantly and is one of the more memorable cinematic moments for me in a long time.

The writer of the film (and director) took some big risks with this movie.  He didn't follow the standard plot and time lines.  Instead, he let's the viewer really get to know these people, their character--who they are inside--and let's us follow them around a bit.  And he breaks the rules a second time--he doesn't start off with a bunch of action, or drama--just some simple scenes, showing us the depth of these two people.  Then he breaks the rules yet a third time--he gives these two characters CHARACTER.  They are deep people, of sincerity who have been overlooked in their lives for that very reason.  Much like any of us who just try to live our lives well.  We don't often get acclaim for doing a good job and trying to be responsible.  Then when these two meet--and the chemistry is awesome.  (Really, we first get to see their chemistry in Stranger Than Fiction--which if you haven't seen, then do.  In fact, it appears the writer might have seen them together in THAT film and plopped them down in this one.  Whatever the reasoning for pairing up Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, it WORKS).

3146442,3,B0015OKWKS,"This movie starts off slow and it takes awhile to feel invested in the characters.  However, somewhere towards the middle of the movie, I found myself quietly drawn into caring about them and eagerly wanted to find out what destiny had in store for the two.

Dustin Hoffman stars as Harvey Shine, a seemingly successful jingle composer who has made a good life for himself. However, as the story unfolds, Harvey is quietly depressed, lonely and disappointed with himself that he has never quite measured up in life.  We learn that he is divorced and preparing to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding although he has been alienated from her for some time.  To make matters worse, he is told by his boss that the jingle he is working on for a TV advertisement had better be a home run or else.  Arriving in London, Harvey crosses paths with Emma Thompson's character Kate Walker, a survey taker at Heathrow airport.  In a hurry, Harvey brushes her off and we soon learn that Kate is no stranger to disappointment in her life as well.  Hurt one too many times, Kate would like to meet that special someone but really isn't willing to risk being hurt anymore and instead spends her time reading, hanging out with friends and checking on her mother who lives alone.  Like Harvey, she too is quietly sad, lonely and depressed, facing the reality that she may never know fulfillment.  Both are actually good and capable people but somewhere along the line inertia set in and they let the losses in their lives overwhelm them, living each day with regret rather than seeking their true dreams and desires.

As the movie progresses, Harvey and Kate struggle with more disappointment when their paths cross once again.  It is here where the movie begins to get interesting.  Harvey and Kate do not make an instant love connection.  In fact, they make anything but.  What unfolds is actually a tender and honest portrait of a friendship in the making that may or may not lead to a physically romantic relationship.  It is this developing friendship, this tentative sharing with one another about each's hopes, dreams and yes, losses, that provides the drama for the movie.  Some people may not like this movie because, like Harvey and Kate, it takes some investment to realize its payoff.  The drama that builds is more subtle than earth shattering. But, because of this, the story is much more plausible and as such, the ending much more rewarding and fulfilling than many other romantic comedies/dramas.",1267920000,,2504,4.77262180974478

If, however, you are looking for a thoughtful and surprisingly human story, then Last Chance Harvey deserves your attention. Rather than finding this movie slow and boring, my wife and I felt compelled to stay up past our bedtime because we simply couldn't fall asleep until it was over.

Yes, the movie moves at a walking pace--that's part of its charm! We should rediscover the skills of paying attention to a real story that does not require the aide of special effects and heart-pounding action.

Kate is attracted to Harvey's simple, humorous chatting-up approach, and he likes her straightforwardness. Over the course of two days, these two ""failures"" form a bond that just may last.

Hoffman and Thompson turn in a pair of subtly nuanced, genuine performances in which each ""becomes"" their character, allowing the audience to forget that they're actors. In keeping with the overall mood of the piece, lighting and backgrounds are consistently muted,  while supporting performances are competent yet ancillary. Last Chance Harvey is a wistful, gentle, and appealing little romance, perfect for spending a quiet evening at home. No bells and whistles here.",1263686400,2,1026,5.212121212121212
3146445,3,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey was a movie that was equal parts uncomfortable and sad as well as uplifting and hopeful. The beginning was very difficult to watch as we are introduced to the main characters via their painfully dull, lonely, and self-defeating lives. Kate is a poll taker in an airport and Harvey is a jingle writer fighting for his job. Single, lonely, and socially inept, these two happen to run into each other through the circumstances of plot and the movie begins to finally pick up.
If fact, the movie seems to bottom out just before it picks up, exactly as the lives of these characters do. I was close to stopping it, I'll be very honest. Watching Dustin Hoffman's Harvey play out his schleppy downtrodden life was cringing. Thompson's Kate is a bit less grating, but either way, the director goes to great lengths to let you know that these are two thoroughly defeated people.
After their second meeting, the two strike up a relationship and therein the movie begins the redemptive part. There was genuine warmth and a sense of hope finally blooming for these two sad people. I felt the ending was tacked on, however, and that the movie could've ended ten or fifteen minutes earlier without the forced tension and syrupy ending, but that's Hollywood.
Last Chance Harvey has some very good observations about marginalized dads in divorce that spoke to me with bitter honesty. Furthermore, there are salient points about remorse over life choices, as well as how easy it seems to retreat to our miserable world for the sheer but sad comfort of it. Using older people was necessary as credulity would've been strained otherwise. I had to believe that these two people had fallen so far below the radar that getting back into life would seem uncomfortable and difficult.
While not perfect, this movie was good enough to certainly rent and then see about purchasing it from there. I picked up my copy used for a few dollars and it is worth the small price tag. It's predictable but also satisfying.",1263340800,,2005,4.764367816091954

Because of his age, his boss, Marvin, treats him as if he's no longer an asset to the company, suggesting that he stay in London (Harvey's daughter is getting married there) for a while instead of rushing back to work.
Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) works for the Public Statistics Agency in the airport and makes a living taking surveys from any arriving passenger who will allow her to ask the questions. She has a friend who tries to play matchmaker and a mother who craves her attention, phoning her constantly when they are apart.
And Kate's mother Maggie (Eileen Atkins) has her own little storyline. She had an active imagination but I could understand why she thought what she did. This woman amused me.
I felt bad for Harvey and Kate in the beginning because they seemed so alone in the world. Harvey was treated like an outcast at his daughter's wedding and that bothered me. And when his daughter gave him news that hurt him to his heart, I hurt right along with him. I was so glad when he found his voice at the reception. The toast he made brought tears to my eyes. And Kate -it seemed she was just going through the motions of life. When these two people got together I was so happy for them. They were lovable people even though they didn't seem to think so and they were good for each other.

And the pacing is fantastic. It carries you along easily -- not a single scene is too long and not a single moment drags. And the chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson is surprisingly perfect. Goodness. I wish they would make a sequel.

Hoffman's acting is astonishing. I finally ""get"" what he does, and it's astonishing to see because so few actors do it anymore. His character actually listens. Processes. Then reacts. In the real time time of the movie, on the screen. It's the exactness you get from credible ""reality tv.""

3146453,4,B0015OKWKS,"My first two thoughts on sitting down to watch this pretty-good film were ""Christ, Dustin Hoffman's getting old!"" And ""Wow, Emma Thompson looks great!"" Hoffman is Harvey Shine, professional New York advertising jingle writer who regrets never having become a jazz pianist. He and his wife split some years ago (he wasn't that great a husband or father, as he admits) and now his daughter is getting married in London. Having flown over to take part, he finds she wants her stepfather to give her away instead. Moreover, his career is falling apart and his boss finally sacks him by cell phone. That's half the set-up. There's also Emma as Kate Walker, self-employed as (apparently) an airport poll-taker with a couple of employees and a neurotic mother, whose social life seems to consist of going on blind dates set up by her friends only to be abandoned by whomever she's with. Harvey, naturally, bumps into Kate both arriving in the country and attempting to depart. But the airline screws up and he's delayed in London for another day, and the two sort of drift together -- largely because Harvey rather desperately insists on trying to establish a relationship. His doggedness about it is wince-provoking; in real life, Kate probably would tell him to sod off. But the funny thing is, in this story, it works. They spend a good deal of time walking and talking, Kate finally drags him to the wedding reception he hadn't meant to attend, and things work out finally with his daughter. It's a matter of Harvey trying to organize what is clearly his ""last chance"" for any kind of happiness and of the never-married Kate trying to decide whether to take the chance of being hurt.

3146455,5,B0015OKWKS,"I was completely impressed with 'Last Chance Harvey.'  The story just grows on you.

Here you have a man who is on his last legs of his long successful career going to a strange land to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.  He is met with so many obstacles and difficulties where you think he is ready to give up.  Yet, he keeps going, moving ever forward, believing there is something out there.

You also see a wonderful person who is highly involved with her mom who is divorced.  She really never seems to get on with people and has a few hang ups in life where she toils in what is a lonely world for her.

Amazingly, this story is only a weekend long, but you feel a sense of the characters full lives.  One snippet here and one there gives you full view.  This is an amazingly crafted story as well.

You see Harvey Shine (Hoffman) consistently pursue his new interest, Kate Walker (Thompson) after all of his world has seemingly collapse.  It gives you the feeling that maybe that is how he did his work all these years.  Yet, his work and his life are the cause of some of the way things turned out.  You learn about his whole family life in one conversation with his ex played by Kathy Baker, who is married to Jame Brolin, playing the effusive and very much liked step dad.

Yet we are not left without some picture of hope for the lonely.  Life continues there is another day to come and in the end instead of a euphoric ending we get to see that just beginning.

The extra in this video of the reasons behind the film are just excellent.  In fact anyone seeing this immediately after the movie, may look and even be more impressed.  One of the trailers in the DVD is the 'Visitor.'  Frankly, the feeling you get from 'Last Chance Harvey' is pretty much the same.

Movies like these give us hope in the human spirit.  Afterall, we are all human and struggle with our humanity.  A little hope now and then helps.",1255478400,,1927,4.338935574229692
3146456,4,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey opens with Harvey Shine (Hoffman), an over-the-hill jingle writer who's about to lose his job. He's flying to London to his daughter Susan's wedding, but promises to return on time for a key meeting with a client. In London, Harvey quickly finds himself alone in a hotel while the rest of the family and guests, his estranged wife and her new husband included, rent a house in the city. He is awkward in his interactions with others, even Susan, making blunders at every turn and creating even more awkward silences. Harvey eventually works up the courage to tell Susan he will not be attending her reception in favor of flying back for the meeting, and Susan reveals that she asked her step-father to give her away at the wedding instead.

Londoner Kate (played by Emma Thompson)is an airport employee, surveying people as they de-plane. She is quite close to being called an ""old maid"", and her friends set her up on uncomfortable blind dates with guys who have little interest in her. Kate's and Harvey's paths intersect in an airport bar. Harvey misses his flight and finds out that he's been fired after all; he drowns his sorrows in shots next to Kate's who's reading with a glass of wine.

Harvey chats her up and they wind up spending the day together; Kate eventually convinces Harvey to attend Susan's reception, which she attends with him. Not surprisingly, Kate becomes Harvey's ""last chance"" at love and companionship, and their quirks somehow mesh together. Alone they are awkward and uncomfortable, but together they blossom.

I watched the trailer for Last Chance Harvey prior to seeing the movie, and the trailer summed it all up - there were no surprises in the movie itself. Last Chance Harvey presents a nice and heartfelt story, great acting and a lot of charm. I think the movie's crowning glory was Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Harvey Shine, and the awkwardness he exuded on screen (unless of course he is that awkward in real life, which I wouldn't know). At times, I almost squirmed at Harvey's actions - refusing to shake hands, fumbling over toasts, walking into things, etc.

Last Chance Harvey was a good movie with a nice storyline, but there was nothing too memorable or worth discussing with others; it was just a way to pass the time.",1254441600,,2287,4.782278481012658

But where the film starts to fall apart is with the supporting characters - all of which seem like a waste of time.

Golden Globe nominees for comedy, Hoffman and Emma didn't really play anything for a laff. The natural idiocy of the human condition were well understood by the players.

This 93 minute movie is rated PG-13 and stars Dustin Hoffman (Harvey Shine) and Emma Thompson (Kate).  James Brolin plays a fairly brief part as the Step-Father (Brian) of Harvey's daughter (Susan Shine) and husband of Harvey's ex-wife (Jean).  The story line is about 2 people who are not having any luck with relationships, but they find out it is never too late to meet a mate, while Susan Shine is preparing to and marrying her love, Scott.

Harvey is a pianist who writes jingles and background music for commercials and he's not exactly burning the notes off the pages.  He is seriously close to losing his job.  Harvey lives in the US and daughter Susan lives in London with Jean and Brian, so Harvey must go to London for the wedding.  He does not exactly feel very welcomed when he arrives and finds out that Jean rented a house for everyone else and a hotel room for him and he doesn't exactly jive with the others either when he arrives at the rehearsal dinner. He decides he will just stay for the wedding and skip the reception.  As he tells Susan, she explains that she has asked Brian to give her away (Ouch!).

Meanwhile, Kate is a survey-taker at the airport.  She actually meets Harvey when he first gets off the plane but he tells her he is in a hurry and runs off.  Kate has a mother who believes her neighbor is weird and thinks he has a body in the shed.  Momma calls Kate constantly on the cell phone to complain about the neighbor.  Kate has no social life so her co-worker tries to set her up with a blind date.  That bums out when the guy's friends show up at the pub and Kate does not seem to fit in.  After the wedding, Harvey goes to the airport only to find out he cannot fly out until the next day.  In an airport pub, he actually meets Kate and they hit it off.

The movie is good, but nothing outstanding-nothing earth-shattering.  It is just fine performances by 2 fine actors.  No action--it is a love story about 2 good people who stumble upon a relationship with each other.  It is a movie for the hopeful romantic.  Things might not be what you want right now, but they can change overnight, and will never be the same again.

There is also a hidden message in the story.  When things aren't working and you act differently (as Harvey did later in the day), people relate to you differently.  In other words, you may need to change the way you interact with people if you are hoping for different results.",1252886400,,2582,4.3852631578947365
3146461,3,B0015OKWKS,"I really wanted to like ""Last Chance Harvey.""  This is because I like romantic comedies where the leads are something closer to real people than the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  So a movie that has Dustin Hoffman (who I felt was incredible in ""the Graduate"" and ""Rain Man"") and Emma Thompson (who I've loved watching in many films) should have been something I liked.

But for some reason I didn't like it.  Why is that?

<spoilers>

I think the answer to that question is twofold.  First, the plot seemed to be a bit of reach.  I could believe that two people who were ""lost souls"" might hit it off like Hoffman and Thompson's character did.  I just think that they would have needed more time to do so than just walking around for a day.  If I had been reading the script for ""Last Chance Harvey"" in advance of it being made into a film, I would have asked the producers, ""Can't the writer come up with a way to throw the two characters together for a couple of days at least?""

That's what happened in the movie ""the Holiday,"" another romantic comedy that had two women (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet) fall rapidly in love with two men (Jude Law and Jack Black).  In the case of that movie, however, the timeline was two weeks.  While the idea people would really, REALLY get to know each other in that time was a bit of a stretch, it was a lot more believable than ""Last Chance Harvey"" and its much shorter timeline.

The other problem with the plot was its failure to explain why everyone in the movie apart from Emma Thompson was so mean to Dustin Hoffman's character.  Take the case of Hoffman's character's daughter.  She and he had apparently grown apart since he got divorced from her mom.  She had grown closer to her stepdad.  So she decided she wanted him to give her away at the altar.  I could see someone deciding to do that.  I really could.  But for the life of me, I don't see how the daughter would have waited until her (real) father had flown all the way over to London to attend the wedding and sprung that rather nasty surprise on him the day before.  With no explanation, doing that just seemed cruel.

So I was disappointed by this movie, but I know a lot of people liked it.  So some time in the future, I may take another crack at it...which is why I gave it three stars and not the one or two I really felt it deserved.",1252108800,,2359,4.297052154195011

I thought Kathy Baker who played the part of Harvey's ex-wife also did an excellent job and was the perfect actress to play the part.  I was rooting for them all the way through the movie.

I liked the fact that this was a love story about an older couple.  Love stories about young people are a dime a dozen and it's nice to remember that falling in love has no age limit.  They were just as sweet and romantic as any couple, in parts shy, in other parts showing the self assurance that comes with experience.  It was the kind of script that made me really like the characters and empathize with them.

3146469,3,B0015OKWKS,"Boy meets girl. Boy woos girl. Girl and boy have misunderstanding, but iron it out.

Well, imagine that scenario for the fiftysomething set. ""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those thoroughly mediocre little movies that only manages to make itself memorable because it happens to star great actors. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson manage to turn this middle-of-the-road romantic comedy into something worth watching on a lazy summer afternoon, as long as you don't expect much plot.

The titular character (Hoffman, natch) is a down-on-his-luck musician/jingle-writer who visits England for his daughter's wedding, but fate seems determined to make him miserable -- women ignore him, his daughter has dropped him in favor of her stepfather, and he's humiliated at the rehearsal dinner. The only person who hasn't caused poor Harvey to drop further is pretty Kate Walker (Thompson), an interviewer whom Harvey brushes off at the airport.

Unsurprisingly, when they actually spend some time together, Kate and Harvey begin to click and Harvey starts openly pursuing this new woman who actually treats him like a human being. His self-confidence and charm begin to grow as Kate begins to reciprocate his feelings -- but when they hit a sudden snag in their first date, Harvey may have lost his last chance.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those plots that has been around for eons, especially in movies: lonely single people reluctantly find love with each other, despite a few ""Love Affair"" obstacles and misunderstandings, and turn their miserable pathetic lives around. It's neither a really good movie nor a bad one -- just sort of average, especially since the climactic obstacle turns out to be a really contrived, rather overwrought misunderstanding. Bleah.

But it does have a certain amount of charm, once Joel Hopkins has finished heaping every kind of indignity imaginable on Harvey without resorting to slapstick (seriously, give the guy a break!). There's  a certain sweetness to seeing some perpetually disappointed people suddenly blossoming in utterly ordinary ways -- shopping, conversing, and getting awkwardly to know each other. And some of the gentle humor is amusing as well -- such as Kate's mother being convinced that her neighbor is a serial killer.

Honestly, this movie would be forgettable if it weren't for Hoffman and Thompson, both of whom are sublimely awkward, sweet and touching. Hoffman seems like a quietly enduring presence that is constantly beaten down by the world, but never gives in; and though it's not terribly convincing that someone who looks like Emma Thompson would be a lonely spinster, she is definitely Hoffman's match and (though no clear answers are given) obviously the person who belongs with him.

And thankfully there are no cheap ploys for audience sympathy, just a pair of strong presences that fill the entire movie. The supporting actors also do a good job -- nobody is demonized even if they do Harvey wrong -- but they're overshadowed by the two leads.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those ""nice"" little movies that are pleasant but unexceptional in any way, except for the lead actors. A good lazy afternoon movie, but not one that will stick in your mind.",1248307200,,3217,5.100760456273764
3146470,5,B0015OKWKS,"This movie has received a lot of negative or neutral reviews, but I absolutely loved and adored this movie! It is the story of two lonely misfits, Dustin Hoffman as Harvey Shine and Emma Thompson as Kate Walker who find each other in London.

Harvey is a frustrated jingle writer who wants to be a jazz pianist and Kate works at Heathrow Airport as a surveyer/greeter and she wants to write. They meet at a time when life is kind of low for each of them. Harvey is coming to London for his daughter's wedding. And the daughter has chosen her stepfather to give her away. He is about to be fired from his job as a jingle writer--making way for new and younger talent. Kate is in dead end, thankless job and she has to deal with her very dependent mother.

This is a romantic comedy and is predictable, but the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are superb. You find yourself cheering for these two adults as they take baby steps in finally growing up. They have a wonderful chemistry between them. It isn't the mad passion of a younger person, but rather the burgeoning love and respect of two mature adults.

The movie moves along at a slower pace than many are used to, but it is full of nuances and subtly which makes the story all the more satisfying.",1248048000,,1268,4.410256410256411
3146471,2,B0015OKWKS,"I watched this movie because I like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson very much. With these two powerhouse actors, with the quality of story the directors and producers had to work with, I cannot believe they ended up with such a substandard product. Shame on all of them! The story is about two lonely, older people who have not achieved their dreams, meet inexplicably at an airport bar and in real-world time, managed to strike up a relationship, go shopping for clothing suitable for a wedding, and then make it TO the wedding in about what I calculated had to be no more than two hours. I am one who can stretch my imagination almost to the tipping point, but this movie also expected us to believe that the character played by Hoffman changed from a frumpy, down-in-the-dumps loser into an upbeat, talented, somewhat engaging personality, while sitting at that airport bar, after spying Ms. Thompson's character alone at a table, reading a book.

After being subjected to abject humiliation by Hoffman's daughter's kind of ridiculous decision to have her step father walk her down the aisle, which is another critique I could go into altogether, I tipped over that edge and slipped down that cliff when Hoffman and Thompson show up (two hours later, mind you) at the reception, and somehow, Hoffman manages to overcome all of his miseries and unfair experiences at this wedding and give what, I think was supposed to be, a tear-jerking toast to his undeserving daughter and new husband.

All I can say is, if Hoffman and Thompson were NOT in this movie, I wouldn't be writing this review. This one would have gone where all the other bad movies go to die. Two stars for two great actors. No stars for the director, producer, studio execs, etc. who abused them.",1247443200,4,1765,4.745928338762215
3146473,4,B0015OKWKS,"First, this is not a comedy. It's also not so much a romance as it is belated coming of age story for a pair of potentially romantic characters.
It's marketed as such so don't hold that against the film or its cast.

Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson do a good turn here with performances that feel real, desperate, moving but not cloyingly winsome.
Harvey, played very well by Hoffman, is a man at the end of his disappointing career. He had some fun with writing and performing in the jingles for commercials, but he's a musician at heart who has never felt like he was doing what he truly loved. It paid the bills.
Emma is another victim of the world moving too fast to keep up. Hoping for a chance at romance she seems to always be in the wrong place and in marginal situations. Her ability to actually breakdown as she privately stifles tears is heart rending. Worse, she's a character with a personal guard so fixed into position that she'd immediately avoid a good hug, knowing a futile, even if sincere gesture when she sees one.
While Hoffman's Harvey is being unmanned by his own daughter on the night before her wedding in an alienating setting, Thompson's Kate is watching her blind date unravel when opportunistic friends of her ""date"" drop in on him while she's in the loo, making her the odd person out. On top of that she has a paranoid mother calling her cell at the most inopportune moments. Kate attempts this juggling act as a loving daughter trying very hard not to dismiss her mother, taking the time to encourage her mother, but also to have a life of her own.
Of course, these two meet. Eventually Harvey's jovial nature and puppy dog charm starts to win her over. Still, there's a palpable distance and they are strangers. It takes her letting her guard down and Harvey risking her utter alienation to get them on an even footing. The charm of this film is not in just the characters or the story. The setting of London as a backdrop, with all it's diverse and multi-ethnic charm and old world quality makes this the perfect place for such a budding relationship to get started. Both, in their own way, are pretty much at odds with their world but also lost within it. This allows them both an opportunity they otherwise would not have taken.
I love the quiet dignity of this film set in a teaming city. It has unexpected humor and subdued charm as these two character find not only themselves, but do it through each other.
It ends in hope, not in finality. In todays confusing world with it's ever shifting priorities even a toe hold in something real is enough to make a person glow with hope.",1247356800,,2620,4.504201680672269
3146474,5,B0015OKWKS,"More than a bit like Before Sunrise for the mature adult set, this film is charming and poignant.  Excellent performances abound from the cast.  If anything, this is a movie about hope.  Life can twist and turn in delightful ways if you don't give up, and if you look for opportunities right for you.  Lately, romantic comedies and dramas seem to have become extremely cliched and banal.  While this film is rather formulaic, it strays from type in that the two lead characters are older, and also that the romance is almost a subplot to Harvey finding a way back to a purposeful life again.  It doesn't hurt, that as a 30-something woman, I found Dustin Hoffman to be quite good-looking as Harvey, he's aged well.  I also admire Emma Thompson in almost anything she is in.  This would be a good choice for an older couple looking for a romantic movie to share together or for a girls night movie.

3146477,4,B0015OKWKS,"OK, I'm getting older.  I admit it.  But come on, Dustin Hoffman in a romantic comedy?  Now? With the great English actress, Emma Thompson... She'll tower over him.  Who thought this up?  It's got to be quirky or artsy-fartsy, and he's simply going to whine on my nerves.

Storyline: a divorced, music ad/'jingle toons' composer heads off to England to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.  His job's going down the tubes, he's lonely, depressed, jetlagged, and his ex-wife and her super, perfect husband(of course James Brolin, really towering over Dustin) are there for the bride.  He's tired and grumpy and sarcastic and out of place and apparently miscast.

He blows off Emma's character who's taking surveys at the airport but later runs across her at an empty pub.  Her desolate life with frequent check on you calls from mom, the ever ubiquitous, ever solid British actress Eileen Atkins(super in ""Crawford"") plays back and forth in comparison with Harvey's life until they discover each other.

For a day or so, they're not alone anymore but are two very human, real  people, not caricatures.  In the 'making of' section, both actors relate how they wanted to be more like themselves and more natural.  Neither all neurotic or goofy, but intelligent and complex.  There's a few silly moments, but by in large, they mute the humor and the sentimentality balancing off each other.  And there are no bad people in the story just poor first impressions and life decisions.

All the actors are good.  His daughter played by Canadian actress Liana Balaban is perfect showing her longstanding hurt and disappointment with her neglectful Dad but still wanting (or hoping she'll want) him there.

This flick won't appeal much for the youngsters(less than 40?)unless they want to see a mature, romantic comedy without much language, no sex, no special effects, some predictability and with the wonderful English background and the superb craft of these two amazing actors.",1246492800,,1974,5.055727554179566

Those of us who are older, who have been there, who've experienced long-term lonely, will not notice the beginning of the movie as being boring and slow, but instead a reflection of how life can become tedious and difficult to adults without a mate. They fall to trying to find rewards in jobs, senior parents, adult kids, books, etc. & of course fail. It's just not the same. Youth seldom ""get it"". It takes a couple to decades, midlife crisis age, and commonplace failings to be able to see the story behind the story.  Those people will ""get it.""

The second half of the movie is brilliantly played by Thompson and Hoffman, strangers who meet in London by accident, who suddenly recognize a possibility of love, a second chance, a moment of winning, a time of relationship that might...just might...be extended long-term. This is a full-length movie version of REALITY TV but done so much better.

For those who just might be too young for this type of film...I strongly suggest that first you watch the Special Feature ""An Unconventional Love Story: The making of Last Chance Harvey"" prior to watching the feature. That will help young adults who have not yet experienced decades of life's failures, to grasp the significance of the subtleties in the acting, the interaction between the stars, and this entertaining but realistic love story.

Each with their charms and their baggage, the progress of their relationship could not be predicted, but offered a subject for hope.

Then it happened. Apparently the producers insisted on lobotomies for the writers as a condition of continued employment.

The pair agree to meet ""tomorrow at noon."" Just in case you missed it, one character makes the other repeat this, twice. These are sophisticated, mature adults in the twenty-first century. They both have cell phones (we know this because they're constantly being interrupted). Why do they never bother to exchange phone numbers?

No points for guessing the next plot twist. :-(

Having set up this entirely contrived dramatic tension, ""Last Chance Harvey"" proceeds to resolve it and treat that as a resolution of the film... totally abandoning the worthwhile story that could have been built from the drama inherent in the characters themselves.

During that time they moped around, woke up, worked and answered their cell phones.

There must have been fifteen minutes dedicated to watching the mother look out of the window. Another fifteen wasted watching the leading characters answer their cell phones.

3146497,5,B0015OKWKS,"...Fortunately I didn't have to.  These two brilliant actors star in Last Chance Harvey, a delightfully adult drama.  I was describing the film to a friend recently, and I told him, ""It's not a comedy, really, but it's funny like real life.""  And that sort of sums this film up for me.  It's far more like real life than you usually see on the big screen.

The story is a character study of two very real people.  Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a 60-something jingle writer who always wanted to be a jazz pianist, but was never good enough.  He may have seen some success in the past, but his career is waning.  His marriage ended long ago, and it's clear he's not close to his daughter.  Nonetheless, he's flying to London for her wedding.  There Harvey encounters Kate Walker (Thompson) a lonely, 40-something woman who spends entirely too much time on the phone with her elderly mother.  She has close friendships and enriches her life with books and writing classes, but none of that makes up for what's missing.  An unlikely couple, when Kate and Harvey come together, they're greater than the sum of their parts.

And in the hands of Hoffman and Thompson, these characters couldn't be more believable, sympathetic, or true to life.  I defy you to watch the wedding toast without tearing up.  Last Chance Harvey isn't a big or flashy film, but it's smart and entertaining.  It's also given a nice DVD presentation, with a 16:30 making of featurette, and an above average commentary featuring writer/director Joel Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman.  So often actor commentaries can be vacuous, but in the hands of these masters there were real insights into character and craft.

The movie is indeed lovely but so darn slow! Although the acting was amazing; actually, it was phenomenal, I was still falling asleep. I can't help but wonder what this movie could have been in the hands of another, more dynamic director.

I especially like the featurette as it revealed a lot of interesting things about the movie. For example, I though the movie was based on a book. Actually, the screenplay was written especially for the actors Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.",1245024000,7,846,4.957746478873239
3146500,5,B0015OKWKS,"I must confess I am not biggest fan of romantic comedies in the realm of cinema.  This is mainly due to the fact that in the past ten years (I feel) that romantic comedies all follow the same stereotypical formula:

- Young guy meets young girl.
- Both guy & girl are very superficial (to some degree).
- Both guy & girl are very materialistic (to some degree).
- Both guy & girl cannot act.
- The comedy is grossly pratfalls & physical jesting.
- In addition the comedy is crude humor limited by a PG-13 rating.
- With 15 to 20 minutes left in the movie there is an arbitrary ""conflict"".
- The conflict is resolved in an unbelievable and/or empathizing manner.
- Guy and girl reconcile but still retain their superficial/materialistic ethos.

I am happy to say that ""Last Chance Harvey"" is none of the above.  It was a movie unlike any I have seen in a long time. Dare I say a neo-vintage romance film?

Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) is traveling to London in order to attend his only daughter's wedding.  It appears that over the years Harvey has become the outcast of the family.  This is evident by his daughter's request to have her step-father give her away rather than having her real father, Harvey, to perform this duty.  To add insult to injury, Harvey has also lost his job as a composer for music used in TV ads.

Meanwhile Kate (Emma Thompson) is a resident of London and works in an airport.  Kate also is living the single life, but is semi-hopeful she might meet somebody.  In addition, her mother is constantly irking Kate about myriad things.  These things are but not limited to Kate's love life and a supposed ""serial killer"" living next door.  Needless to say Kate has become tired of the humdrum routine.

It isn't any big shock to figure out what happens next, when Harvey meets Kate.  I sort of knew this going into the movie, so it didn't bother me.  What makes this movie magically is the chemistry between Thompson and Hoffman.  This chemistry is what makes the inevitable so enduring.  Another thing interesting about this movie is it isn't a ""romantic comedy"".  Rather it is just a throwback to those romantic films of the 1950/60s.  This movie has some funny moments, but by no means is comedy.  Also it is really refreshing to see a movie about love and relationships that doesn't focus on model-esque twenty something guys and gals.

The DVD comes with both a widescreen and full screen version of the movie.  I watched the former and I am glad I did.  ""Last Chance Harvey"" shows amazing cinematography of London, as well as some interesting camera angles.  I feel these would be lost in the full screen version of the film.  Which is funny because I normally wouldn't think this is a movie that needs to be viewed in letterbox.  There are also some trailers/previews on the DVD, as well as a featurette about the making of the movie.

If you are in the mood for romance that is subtle, bitter-sweet, enchanting and human, than ""Last Chance Harvey"" is the movie for you.  My first response to watching this movie was that it wouldn't be any good.  I am so glad I viewed this film because it allowed me to be charmed for 90 minutes, and that hasn't happened in a long time.",1245024000,2,3198,4.511304347826087
3146501,4,B0015OKWKS,"Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, lonely composer of jingles for TV commercials.  His daughter is getting married and bride and groom have settled for the ceremony in London.  Emma Thompson plays a middle aged woman with a dreadful job and controlling mother.  She is lonely too but seems to be used to being disappointed in people, particularly her blind dates.

During wedding rehearsal, it is apparent to Harvey that he is completely separated from his family.  His daughter announces that she will be given away by her stepfather.  Harvey and his ex-wife are estranged and she lets him know that he is paty of one during his daughter's most important moment in her life.  In the meantime, Harvey's boss decides to have him fired.

As series of coincidences progress, these two lonely people connect in a matter of days.  It becomes apparent to both of them that regardless of how little they know each other, the fact that they come from two different generations and disparate continents, they owe to each other a last chance in getting some happiness out of life.",1244937600,,1070,4.835164835164835
3146502,3,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a rare example of a modern Hollywood romantic comedy featuring a mature couple meeting and falling in love.  The leads, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, are top tier performers who put a lot of heart into their work.  Neither of them seem to be overly challenged with the material in this film, but romantic comedies are by nature lightweight and predictable.  Although this movie delivers on the formula, ultimately the romance angle didn't work for me.

Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a New York advertising executive and jingle writer who hops a plane to London to attend his daughter's wedding.  In London he finds himself marginalized in all the wedding plans; his daughter even informs him that she has decided to ask her stepfather to give her away.  He misses his flight home.  He is fired from his job over the phone.  Following that perfect storm of a bad day he decides to slam down a few Jack Daniels in the airport lounge and this is when he meets Kate Walker (Thompson).

What I liked most about this movie were the performances.  Thompson shows no fear of being ""dowdied up"" for her role as a middle aged, middle class spinster in a dead end job.  She is a few pounds heavier than we're used to seeing, wears polyester and a ponytail scrunchie, and allows herself to be photographed from various unflattering angles.  Even with all this, it's impossible to disguise that this is a beautiful woman with a good nature and a generous heart. She's irresistible.

Hoffman, on the other hand, may have been too good at fleshing out Harvey.  At times he comes across as a desperate stalker, forcing his company on this polite lady, following her onto her commuter train, and waiting for her outside her classroom.  She really doesn't know much about this guy when she agrees to accompany him to the wedding reception.  What we see (and why doesn't Kate?) is that this guy is not well liked by those family and friends who know him best; he rudely abandons Kate at the kid's table while he dances with a variety of partners and only resumes his efforts with Kate after she has quietly gotten up to leave.

While I'd love to be able to recommend ""Last Chance Harvey"" without reservations, I found it impossible to suspend disbelief enough to imagine it working out for these two.  During the course of this movie the couple has an acquaintance of less than 24 hours.  Kate has been on the receiving end of Harvey's rude behavior more than once, but that doesn't seem to matter.  We should be grateful that Hollywood didn't go the usual route of casting a 20-something actress as Kate, but I found the age gap of 20+ years quite significant when the younger partner is pushing 50.  (Thompson was 49 and Hoffman 70; she mentions in the commentary that she's playing around 44 and he's playing around 65. Oh, well...THAT makes it better.)  To further complicate matters, she has a dead end job; he's unemployed.  She lives in London; he lives in White Plains, NY. The list goes on.  Part of what makes falling in love at 50 different from falling in love at 20 is that people have learned something more about life. Kate and Harvey are too old to throw caution to the wind like teenagers, but too young for their dotage.

Oddly, the DVD package includes two disks.  The basic difference appears to be that one has the film in wide screen presentation and additional special features; The other disk offers the film in full screen presentation.  The break down is like this:

Disc 1: Feature in Wide screen Presentation; Setup: Audio - Dolby Surround 5.1, Audio Commentary with writer/director Joel Hopkins, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Subtitles in English for the deaf and hearing impaired, or Spanish; Scene Selections; Special Features: Featurette - An Unconventional Love Story, the Making of Last Chance Harvey, Theatrical Trailer, ""Also on DVD"" previews for other films.

Disc 2: Feature in Full Screen Presentation, Subtitles, Scene Selections, ""Also on DVD"" trailers for other films.

Suitable for most family viewing between the ages of 9 to 90.  The film contains a small amount of mild swearing, no violence or sex.",1244937600,,4155,4.751743375174337
3146513,4,B0015OKWKS,"There is an early scene which sets the story for me. It is when Harvey (Dustin Hoffman), a commercial jingle writer, is in flight to London to attend his daughter's wedding. Harvey has tried to converse with his seat neighbor who cooly rebuffs him. A lone cone of light from overhead shines down on Harvey in the dark airplane cabin, as he is surrounded by sleeping passengers. Here we are introduced to a lonely man, who never seems to fit in with the crowd, who is unable to say the right things at social gatherings, who drinks a little too much. He confesses at one point in the story that he has always felt his own family was embarrassed of him. We see this as he sits in his hotel room alone in London, as he tries to connect especially with his ex-wife and daughter at the reception.

His last chance comes as he is arriving at the Heathrow terminal and is approached by Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) an airline agent who conducts passenger surveys. Kate is single, sort of stuck at a place in life with a nervous clinging mother, and  who no longer fits in with the younger single scene. Harvey bumps into Kate again when he decides to fly back to New York before the wedding after he learns that his daughter has asked her step father to give her away at the altar. Harvey casts out the line one last time in the airport bar when he tries to engage Kate in conversation over lunch.

Some film viewers have remarked how unlikely it would ever be for these two people to be paired together. However it is possible, and that is what makes it a delightful love story, especially for those of us who feel by passed by life. It would be a 5 star movie for this romantic, however some of the ""side bar"" stories in the film merely water down the blossoming of the relationship between Harvey and Kate.",1244937600,,1801,4.370149253731343
3146514,5,B0015OKWKS,"At the beginning of this movie, I was wondering if it would become more enjoyable to watch.  The story initially dealt with two individuals played by Hoffman and Thompson who were each separately immersed in deep sadness.

Harvey (Hoffman) struggles with personal emptiness, yet still makes the effort to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding. From the start, he is the Odd-Man Out, displaced from his daughter's life by his former wife and her new husband. Hapless, glum, and alone, Harvey finds himself in an unexpected circumstance.

The lady Kate, (Emma Thompson), has her own demons. She, too, rarely smiles. Her world includes a housebound mother who suspects her neighbor of sinister wrongdoing and a cell phone that keeps ringing. Her attempts to inject fun and socializing into her life aren't quite working out.  Overall, it seems, she is quite lonely and she rarely smiles.

By chance, these two individuals meet. Their short walk keeps getting longer as they discover they have a lot to talk about.  Harvey and Kate smile and laugh together more and more. The humor of the film is subtle and pleasant.

The ultimate destination of their paths is predictable. However, it is uplifting and joyful to see Harvey and Kate come into their own and at the same time, come together.

I happened to watch this with someone who saw it in the case, said dismissively, ""looks like a Chick-Flick"".  He frequently falls asleep in movies or walks out.  Very discriminating-a film has to be good!
Well, he watched this film in its entirety and enjoyed it a lot.

Last Chance Harvey is a surprising sleeper of a film.  All viewers were riveted to the screen as Hoffman and Thompson are clearly superb performers.

This is a lovely film; cinematography is excellent.  Do watch the widescreen version-the scenery in London is beautiful and adds to the viewer's enjoyment. The use of color and lighting is also well done.

I honestly didn't expect to like this as much as I did as many reviews have been lackluster. See for yourself- there are many things to like here.",1244937600,,2070,4.824362606232294
3146515,3,B0015OKWKS,"I love Emma Thompson. She's a fantastic actress. The big issues about this movie for me were the age difference between them and Hoffman's sort of unstable/creepy character. I kept thinking that Emma's character would be better off without him! (Not a good thought when the movie's intent is to show a romance between them.) It wasn't a complete train wreck, but not my favorite Emma Thompson movie.",1244592000,,399,4.882352941176471
3146516,4,B0015OKWKS,"THE MOVIE:

I give the movie 3.5 stars.  It was a good movie -- certainly well-acted, and presented with an appropriate amount of emotion.  It's about second-chances (or as the title indicates, last chances), and it's a love story about grown-up people.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The special features earn 5 stars.

The featurette about the making of the film is short -- 16 minutes, but in it you learn that the film was written for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.

The commentary on the film is done by the director, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman.  It's a don't-miss feature of the disc!  I enjoy watching movies with the commentary track, but I rarely get all the way through, unless the commentary is done by people I really like, or if it's an all-time favorite movie.  Oftentimes those involved get carried away and don't add much of interest.

Dustin Hoffman shares candidly about relating to his character -- in regards to his own divorce (he also shares some memories about Kramer vs. Kramer).

In this commentary, we hear Emma Thompson's thoughts on ""the acting process,"" the super-skinny Hollywood actress phenomenon.

If, like her, you are bored with seeing stories of beautiful people fall in love, give Last Chance Harvey a try.",1244592000,,1241,4.880382775119617

I've seen many films like this one, but I haven't been so entertained by one in a very long time. It's funny and sad and has all the usual trapping, but the cast and pacing make this a very pleasant journey. The music score also stands out in this charming and poignant love story.",1244419200,,532,4.373737373737374
3146518,3,B0015OKWKS,"Take two fine actors and put them in a mediocre film and you have two fine boring actors trying to figure out who wrote this junk.  Harvey could be almost any one of us regardless of your sex.  He is the tool of an out of touch management who has one goal and to the devil with Harvey.  Harvey just cannot do anything correctly.  Sounds like me for oh so many years.  I had the feeling that the writers had a basic plot and scheme; however, they did not realize that they had less than 30 minutes of presentation.  With that they had to expand scenes with all the typical car rides or chases, innate walking or talking and just time filling scenes.  At the end the producer said, whew I can't believe we finally made the 93 minutes.  (My words; not his.)

Unlike many of today's movies this one at least had some events that actually touched the common souls of man.  He was a procrastinator of the first order but did not know how to manage his inabilities.  It cost him.  He permitted his family and friends to use him for a door mat.  It cost him.  The moment he found himself in another hotel far away from the action is the moment he should have packed his bag and gave the party a ""adios my friends"" or ""family"" and took to the sky.  In spite of some pretty decent acting, her part was only as a whim and space filling.

3146533,4,B0015OKWKS,"First, this out of the way: I'm not the target audience for this film. The target audience is single, middle-aged women, and some men, who still hold out hope of find that One True Love. Despite not being in the proper demographic, I rather liked thiis film.

""Last Chance Harvey"" tells the story of an American jingle writer (Hoffman), and a British woman (Thompson), who meet each other in London. They don't have much of a Meet Cute, which is appreciated.

We see them as they have their first awkward conversation and gradually grow more comfortable around each other moving towards the inevitable conclusions.

There's a certain sweetness here. The relationship reminds me, of all things, of the relationship between Admiral Adama and President Roslin on ""Battlestar Galactica"". Two people, of a certain age, who find each other, despense with all the adolscent sloppiness normally found in movies, and make a life together.

There's also some real chuckles, though not any loud laughs. It's also quite wonderful to see the performances from Thompson and Hoffman, both of whom are just getting better at their craft as they get older. They have a great chemistry and there's a nice easiness between them that one seldom sees on screen.

Overall, I'd recommend this movie. It's nice, it's sweet, it's short and enjoyable.",1244073600,,1325,5.004545454545455

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with it. The story besides being predictable, moves too slow. The story never picked up momentum and I could not wait for the movie to be over. I'm giving it three stars instead of two because of the fine jobs of the actors.",1244073600,,574,4.373831775700935
3146535,4,B0015OKWKS,"I expected the comedic romance that numbs the brain.  I much more preferred what I found here.  It's part character study, part awkward exchanges, and what it's like ""out there"" when you aren't young any more.

Harvey Shine is in a job he slightly hates writing commercial jingles, Kate Walker has been tossed so often in love that her mother has made it her mission to constantly call and remind Kate about her lack luster love life and keep her company.  Harvey is on his way to England to see his daughter get married (long way to go to see two American kids get married).  His relationship with his daughter is strained and Harvey later admits he thinks he embarasses his daughter.  Harvey's daughter has choosen her step dad to play the traditional ""Dad"" role at the wedding.  And Harvey is crushed and leaves the wedding right after she's married.

It's in the airport bar while drowning his bad day he says Kate.  They exchange some banter and seem to have a similar outlook and humor.  It's awkward, the love story is awkward, even the humor is awkward and I think that is why I found it to be so charming.

I'm sure if you thought hard enough you know a Harvey and/or a Kate.  The acting is superb, the direction is mature and to the point.  You won't, most likely, be swept away with the most moving love story of the ages, but if you find the heart of the movie you might just enjoy it and find yourself charmed.

Dustin Hoffman has never disappointed me in any of his films and this one was no exception.  You can sit back and just enjoy without having to try to figure what the characters are mumbling or why the film is jumping from one place to another before you know what is happening.

3146537,5,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is the type of film that makes you stand back and re-evaluate your life.  ""Am I truly happy?""  ""If not, what can I do to make myself happy?""  ""Is it too late for me to have another chance at happiness?""  ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a bittersweet romantic drama where two mismatched people fall in love and discover that it's never too late to find happiness in life.

  Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man"") gives a radiant performance as Harvey Shine who use to be a lot of fun according to his ex-wife.  Now he is an aging, workaholic musician who has one last chance to sell an advertisement jingle or else it's the unemployment line for him.  He travels to London to attend the wedding of his daughter Susan whom he neglected as a child.  Soon after landing, he learns that he's lost his job, Susan wants her stepfather to give her away at the wedding, and he has just missed his last flight back to the states.  As he reflects on his ruined life, he encounters the reserved Kate Walker (adorably played by Emma Thompson of ""Remains of the Day""); she is a government statistician working at the Heathrow Airport.  Kate would rather be alone, and constantly harangued by her bored mom, than risk the heartache of dating.  Somehow, the two lonesome birds develop a friendship that blossoms into trust and love.

  ""Last Chance Harvey"" taught me that we all make mistakes that we live to regret later on in life.  Fortunately, there is forgiveness.  We must forgive ourselves and move on.  If we don't give ourselves another chance, no one else will.  Whether you are young, middle aged or living in your twilight years, you deserve a second chance and a third chance and so on until you find true love.  And ""Last Chance Harvey"" is filled with love.  The love shared by daughter and mother, the love shared by two newlyweds, and the love shared by friends who only want the best for each other.

  I've always heard that the weather is gloomy in London.  Not so in ""Last Chance Harvey.""  The sun always shined on beautiful London locales such as the Thames River, which seemed to play an important backdrop in this film.  Other London locations included Belsize Park, Maida Vale, Somerset House and Grosvenor House Hotel.  Lovely music is heard throughout the film, such as the song played during the closing credits, ""Where Do We Go,"" written and performed by Sandrine Daniels.

  ""Last Chance Harvey"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy romantic drama with substance, style and class.  Other poignant, emotionally charged films that fall into this category are ""Henry Poole is Here"" and ""The Visitor.""  All of these have been given the royal treatment by Anchor Bay Entertainment.",1243900800,,2697,4.716738197424893
3146538,4,B0015OKWKS,"I still hate romantic comedies but occasionally, I would try to see one just to keep my objectivities grounded. It is a good way to not become jaded with the types of movies I see, after all there is only too much action, fantasy and horror one can see in an extended period before one gets burned out. Heck, I may have just done this for a woman, but you never know. Anyway, Joel Hopkins' ""LAST CHANCE HARVEY"" has one of the most likable actors in the person of Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie, the Graduate) so I decided to give it a chance. Written and directed by Hopkins, the film is an endearing story of just how things just tend to work out in manner truly unexpected, and that taking a chance may lead to our happiness.

Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is song writer who makes commercial jingles who lives in New York. He is having some work issues, as his boss is beginning to see him as the ""old guard"" in a new generation. Well, that's the least of his worries, as he flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding--he is informed that she will be asking her step father to give her away. To make things worst, Harvey missed his return flight and is on the verge of getting fired. Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a woman who works in the statistics department. Kate is a nice lady who is committed to taking care of her mother. Harvey spends the next few hours talking with Kate that the two end up enjoying each other's company immensely. Harvey has one last chance at love, will fate bring them together?

The film's main draw would have to be the performances between Thompson and Hoffman. They play off each other nicely, and I thought it was endearing that Hoffman is a lot shorter than Thompson, it gives their uneasy relationship a needed `character'. The two do appear like they're common folk that you would see walking by. The two do develop some chemistry as the film goes on, the `getting to know you' part of their relationship happens mostly off-camera, which is why some people may not really buy into their `one day' relationship and may say they lacked chemistry. Well, the movie is about taking chances and complications; director Joel Hopkins does manage to flesh out our two leads in a manner I thought was effective.

The first act of the film is more about Harvey, when he arrives in London. He attends a party, with his ex-wife and daughter, and he unavoidably feels very alienated. Anyone would be bummed out when the step-father would be giving his daughter away. Then, Hopkins switches the scenes to see Kate taking care of her mom, then on a blind date that would not work out. It was also quite clever, the way Hopkins tossed in two missed opportunities for the two the meet, one in the airport and one in a cab. The screenplay by Hopkins gave the viewer a good amount of groundwork in fleshing out our two lead characters and remembers to put in a dose of fate into the mix. Only after Harvey misses his flight, with nothing to lose that the two finally get to talk in a bar/restaurant in the airport.

As the title implies, this movie is about Harvey Shine. For a film like this to succeed, it has to have certain heartbreaking moments and Dustin Hoffman delivers quite a few. The scene where he does the toast in the reception is definitely touching, and when he elaborates his failure as a father and as a husband to Kate, just made Harvey one VERY sympathetic character. Emma Thompson's Kate Walker also has her share of baggage's to carry, she seemed to have been stuck in a situation that she feels obligated to follow through. Kate gives hints to her very disappointing past, in the park and also in the film's final act. It was quite sad to see one used to disappointment that it became a routine of life for her.

Now, despite the charm and manner as to how Hopkins manages to get the two together, the film does have its flaws. While the direction manages to flesh out Harvey and Kate, the film focuses more on Harvey, and it feels that Kate's complications aren't as important or significant as those of Harvey's issues. Yes, Harvey does have the more unfortunate path, but I thought there were missed opportunities in fleshing out Kate's issues. I rather thought that the subplot with her mother and the next neighbor was fun and clever, but I was more curious about Kate's background. Kate feels like a supporting character rather than a lead. Harvey's character was obviously better written than hers. Also, the film falls into the usual stereotypical nuances that complicate a relationship in the last act. I thought it was very clich&eacute;d and feels a little long-winded. It would have been better to just have the `taking a chance' part take full circle; but then we see Harvey racing to the airport in pure stereotypical dramatic fashion.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is a charming, endearing tale about adult romance. Despite some plot mistakes, it was admirable in its penchant for adult relationships. It has good intentions but it does come up a little short. There were parts that I wished that this movie had limited supporting interactions and instead relied more on our two characters talking, it may have focused more on the ""taking a chance"" angle. Still, the dramatic performances by Hoffman and Thompson provide the film its needed zest, and the film gets a recommended rating from me.

3146539,3,B0015OKWKS,"I seem to be on a bit of a romantic comedy streak lately, with another recent film viewing (and review) being the somewhat more silly and definitely younger (compared to this film) skewing film New In Town having been watched only a few days before watching this film.  Other than both being romantic comedies, there's really not much in common between that title and this one.

Last Chance Harvey was clearly aimed at providing a vehicle for a couple of actors a bit more long in the tooth, with the still somewhat boyishly looking Dustin Hoffman pairing up with Emma Thompson.  I note somewhat boyishly because if you research Hoffman's real age you may find it somewhat unbelievable that the young fellow that starred in The Graduate so long ago is as old as he really is (born in 1937).  Emma Thompson could easily be Hoffman's daughter given the differences in their ages (she was born in 1959), but that would be a different movie entirely (like say the movie Rumor Has It with Jennifer Aniston) and in reality Thompson stands well enough above Hoffman that you'd have to wonder a bit just who her mother would have had to be.

Despite those age differences, both work well enough for their roles here, as does a snow white haired James Brolin in a small part as the second husband of Harvey's (Hoffman) ex-wife.  Brolin is supposed to be an older gentleman compared to the younger Hoffman, even though Brolin is actually approx. 3 years younger than Hoffman.  With the white hair, Brolin certainly looks the part.

The basic premise of the story is that Harvey Shine is at a bit of a crossroads in his life.  He composes and plays music for commercial jingles.  His daughter (an American) is about to marry another American citizen, but the marriage is to take place in London (where both happen to be) so Harvey must travel even as he has a big deal in the works, perhaps a career breaking deal.  His boss tries to push Harvey to take plenty of time to attend the wedding signaling to Harvey that he's being pushed out of his job, even though he's sure he can still do it and still make the deal.  So, off Harvey goes to attend his estranged daughter's wedding, where he'll wind up (thanks to the writers and perhaps the alignment of the stars) crossing paths with Kate Walker (Thompson) a government employee (survey taker) in London.

In many ways this story is somewhat reminiscent of Lost in Translation, and honestly, in some ways I think the role of Harvey could easily have been filled by Bill Murray (who is a good bit closer to Thompson's age).  That said, I can't complain about Hoffman's performance here, though I wonder if I'd be more 'shocked' by the difference in the actors ages if I were to have seen this on high definition (Blu-ray) as opposed to standard definition DVD.  Regardless, the comparison to Lost in Translation is probably a pretty good one as both are pretty decent examples of character studies.

Honestly, this isn't really a traditional romantic comedy.  It's more serious, more mature, and realistically is a character study that happens to include some comedic elements than it is anything close to a romantic comedy.  There's not much silliness, and if one can overlook the contrivance of having both of the stars cross paths and form a strong bond in a short period of time, it doesn't really contain enough contrivances to qualify in the rom-com category.

I mention Blu-ray above and noted that I viewed this one on DVD (and not Blu-ray).  That's somewhat unusual for me, but in this case I had the DVD available, so that's what I viewed.  Surprisingly the DVD picture quality was pretty nice, while there were background images that weren't as sharp as I'd expect the Blu-ray would offer, the shots of the actors looked very nice.  That said, I wonder if perhaps those same shots would have shown more of Hoffman's age if viewed in high definition.

One thing that my wife and I did notice and which nagged at us a bit, as the film progresses along and Harvey and Kate begin to bond they take a bit of a journey around London that would seem to have occupied a considerable amount of time, yet, somehow, as if by magic they are able to arrive at another event at a key time.  How the day wasn't already fairly well exhausted and how they could get across town in time seems to be a point that we aren't supposed to notice or question.  Other than that though, the film seemed to just fine.

Last Chance Harvey was a decent film, and I might peg it at the 3-1/2 star level if offered the choice of using half stars here.  There's really nothing objectionable about it, and honestly it's somewhat difficult to give any real reason why I couldn't give the film 4 or even 5 stars other than just the feeling that while it's a good film it's not a great film and because of that falls back into the mid-range for me.

Is this one a purchase rather than rental material?  I'd have to say it's borderline.  For some it would make a great purchase, for others, probably not so much.  If possible rent first and then buy yourself a copy after you determine it's something you'd like to watch repeatedly, or perhaps buy a copy for friends and family that you think would enjoy it.",1243814400,,5220,4.556745182012848

3146541,4,B0015OKWKS,"We started watching this movie knowing it was a love story between two middle-aged people.  What we found was a heart-tugging, melancholy slice of life...of two misfits on the outside, looking in.  The time-frame of the story is over a weekend.  Harvey has come to London from the USA to attend the wedding of his estranged daughter.  Kate works at the airport in London, and has gone nowhere with her life, is single, and resigned to her lot in life.  Harvey's job is on the skids, and he is planning to return to the states as soon as he can to save it.  He discovers that his daughter Susan has asked her stepfather to give her away instead of him....low blow!  During the wedding Harvey feels much like the 5th wheel, just hanging around on the sidelines, so he does not stay to attend the reception. Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date and feeling like a fish out of water, while everyone else around her is chatting, and having a good time....and her equally lonely mother keeps calling on her cell phone!  Finally, at the airport after the wedding ceremony, Harvey and Kate meet and realize that they are both kindred spirits plodding along in this sorry life.  They discover a mutual attraction of their alone-ness and build a friendship on it, that turns into more.  She convinces him to return to the reception and try to renew his relationship with his daughter...a very good scene!  He proves to her that he will always be there for her, even with an unexpected event. The story is both sad and happy, and was beautifully done owing to the performances of the outstanding actors Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Did not really see anything that would qualify this movie as a comedy...bittersweet, yes!  I think that most people could relate to some facets of this sad, but sweet story.",1243814400,,1798,4.616352201257862
3146542,3,B0015OKWKS,"At its best, this rather slight 2008 melding of comedy and drama reminds me of Ulu Grosbard's bittersweet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-in-Love/dp/B00005S6K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling in Love</a>&nbsp;(1984) in which Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep stumble into a romantic relationship constantly derailed by guilt and commuter train schedules. At its worst, this film - leisurely directed and written by Joel Hopkins - uses several well-worn cinematic conventions - including a familiar third-act plot device from a classic movie - and forces a predictable ending that is far from satisfying. On the upside, it certainly helps to have actors the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson in the principal roles, although I have to admit I was not taken in by their characters' halting romance because the actors are simply not meshing in a convincing way. In fact, this movie ironically works better when the actors perform in separate scenes away from each other. The problem is that the elfin Hoffman just tries too hard to overcome Thompson's self-protective demeanor of disappointment.

The story focuses on Harvey Shine, a divorced jingle writer whose career seems to be waning in the face of more youthful talent. At the same time, his daughter Susan is getting married in England, so he is anxious to offset his professional disappointments with a family reunion he really needs. However, their estrangement turns out to be deeper than expected since Susan tells him that she has already asked her rugged, engaging stepfather to give her away at the wedding. When he concludes that it is he who has become the family outsider, he meets Kate Walker, an airport employee who has the thankless task of surveying passengers coming off their flights. She also happens to be a lonely spinster who lives near her paranoid mother and finds the prospect of another failed blind date excruciating. Kate and Harvey meet-cute at a Heathrow lounge at their lowest emotional points, and they start to bond over long walks along London's South Bank. She convinces him to go to Susan's reception, and he agrees only if Kate becomes his date. The rest of the plot follows the story arc you would expect.

In perhaps a conscious move, Hoffman seems to be channeling a bit of Benjamin Braddock's schlubby, obsessive nature in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Graduate/dp/B00000F798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Graduate</a>&nbsp;over forty years later. He is at his best when we feel Harvey's rejection in isolation, but the assertive approach the 71-year-old actor takes in courting Kate is challenging to embrace. Thompson, on the other hand, is a pure joy as Kate because she plays against the grain of what could have been a victim character. She wears Kate's disappointment in such a convincingly objective manner that her moments of heartache attain greater resonance. Eileen Atkins and Kathy Baker have just a few scenes to bring their characters to life, Kate's dotty mother and Harvey's still-resentful ex-wife, respectively. London looks pretty inviting thanks to John de Borman's crisp cinematography, though Dickon Hinchliffe's tinkling music punctuates the proceedings excessively. The 2009 DVD contains a nice audio commentary track with Hoffman (recorded separately), Hopkins and a particularly acerbic Thompson. The sixteen-minute featurette reflects the same personalities in a standard making-of format, although both this and the theatrical trailer give away too much of the plot.",1243728000,,3599,5.626151012891344
3146553,4,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey Shine is down to last chances:  his job as a commercial jingle writer is hanging by a thread; his estranged daughter is getting married, giving him perhaps one last chance to reconcile and make amends, and his lonely life has perhaps one last chance at romance.  He flies to London for the weekend to attend the wedding, only to get a cool reception from the wedding party, and when his daughter tearfully informs him that she wants her stepfather (James Brolin) to give her away, you can see his heart break.  Meanwhile, never-married Kate Walker has a thankless job as an airport survey taker, and a demanding mother (Eileen Atkins).  When she's set up on yet another blind date, this time with a younger man who ends up paying more attention to some friends he runs into the bar, you can feel her loneliness.  After ducking out of the wedding after the ceremony, missing his flight, and learning that he's about to be sacked, Harvey comes to drown his sorrows in an airport lounge and meets Kate (for the second time, it turns out).  Once they start trading barbed comments, you know this one is on a familiar romantic comedy track.  But what makes this movie work is the two principals:  Hoffman and Thompson are two Oscar-winners who are always a joy to watch, and together they make terrific chemistry.  As it happens, they first met when filming ""Stranger than Fiction"" a couple of years ago, and despite sharing only a scene or two in that film, they instantly clicked and became friends.  So they eagerly agreed to work on this project, only the second feature directed by writer/director Joel Hopkins.  The featurette on the DVD gives us some insight into their working relationship, and it turns out much of the chemistry is very real and some of the scenes were even improvised.  They capture perfectly the bond of two lonely and apparently different people, and the magic that a middle-aged romance can generate. (And how many good ""middle-aged romance"" comedies have you seen lately?)  They even transcend a plot twist straight out of ""An Affair to Remember"". The supporting cast is strong too, especially Atkins, Brolin, and Kathy Baker (playing Harvey's ex-wife). It doesn't hurt, either, that the film is beautifully shot in London, perhaps my favorite city in the world. I heartily recommend this film - it's a serviceable story, by turns funny and poignant, and buoyed by the excellent performances of its two main characters.",1243728000,,2452,4.823389021479714
3146554,3,B0015OKWKS,"Admittedly, director Joel Hopkins wants to tell a love story about two life's-got-me-down individuals in his film ""Last Chance Harvey"" starring Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Without the added accoutrement of madcap comedy or the usual boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl entanglements, he does manage to showcase two actors with some pleasant chemistry between them in a fairly realistic storyline that promenades to a satisfying conclusion.

Physically, Thompson and Hoffman have a difficult time cutting a rug together.  She towers over him considerably which makes for some awkward footage of the two of them walking along the Thames and dancing at a wedding reception.  Not that any of this really matters, the duo share a companionable attraction for one another that offsets (most of the time) their corporal disparity.  Hoffman, as Harvey Shine, remains a conglomerate of his best known character studies:  he mixes a little of Rain Man's doggedness, Michael Dorsey's/Tootsie's clumsiness and the Graduate's insouciance to inject Harvey with the lifeblood of Hoffman's usually depicted anti-hero.  His portrait of Harvey smacks of realism that adds another dimension to an otherwise ordinary screenplay.

Likewise, as Kate Walker, the incomparable Emma Thompson knows how to play a nuanced mature woman on the brink of throwing in the towel after so many years of mediocrity.  Her tired willingness in dealing with her job and her frustrated ministrations to her needy mother (the wonderful Eileen Atkins) rings with the quiet truth of the many who are life's caretakers rather than actual participants.  Hopefulness beams on her face with the timidity of all things tenuous; we don't want her to be disappointed and cannot hold back our winces when Harvey/Hoffman faux-pas with extraordinary gaucheness.

Nevertheless, their coupling does work as an older couple meeting and falling in love despite a plotline heaped with so many dour situations it makes the audience cringe with dismay.  In a film where nothing really happens, a lot happens between the two leads supported by a cast of experts that put the ""A"" in archetypical.  Look for a snowy-haired James Brolin as the warm and witty stepfather, Kathy Baker as the still-annoyed ex-wife and Liane Balaban as the daughter caught in past crossfire.

Bottom line?  ""Last Chance Harvey"" will not rock your world in either a big or small movie way.  However performances by Thompson and Hoffman do crackle with some electricity that make the 90+ minutes of viewing time worthwhile.  Recommended.

3146556,4,B0015OKWKS,"'Last Chance Harvey' is a movie I really liked more than I thought possible.  Set in London, the slow-paced story is about Harvey Shine, a work-a-holic distanced from his only daughter.  He flies to England for her wedding, feeling like an outsider when told that her stepfather will be giving her away instead of him; of course, her decision could have been based on Harvey telling her that he didn't plan to stay for the reception.  He strikes up a romance with Kate Walker, who works for the airline, after they have lunch together discussing who has had the worst day.

This movie is a love story that focuses on the heart, not mushy smutty crapola.  The sub-plot focuses on a father rebuilding the relationship with his daughter he lost spending too much time on his career.  Bits of humor paired with the stunning London backdrop round this into a movie easily enjoyed by everyone.

People reviewing here said that they didn't buy that Emma Thompson's character is too attractive not to find a man - TOTALLY missing the point . . she just doesn't connect with most men and really doesn't want to even bother. And Dustin Hoffman - I think many men can relate to him as well - woman too. That feeling that in a whole room of people you just will never, ever 'get' the whole thing. You'd rather stay in your hotel room and read the phone book. The only thing I didn't agree with was when Dustin Hoffman gave the father of the bride speech (most of it was great!) and he said that he daughter turned out to be so lovely and kind, etc. even though she was from a broken home. IF she was so kind, why would she have her step-father walk her down the aisle? Yeah, I know, he wasn't a good father - but that was REALLY hitting below the belt - this from a sweet, kind daughter?

Dustin Hoffman is so pathetic in this movie which makes him more likable in an odd way, and I was rooting for him to come out on top. I love how he's shorter than Emma, it's cute.

I like that this whole movie takes place over the span of a short weekend in London, and it's mostly realistic. It's just so sweet. I don't know that I would watch this again even though it ends on a high note.

3146561,4,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey""  is an interesting slant on romantic movies.  Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) and Kate (Emma Thompson) are likable, middle-aged professionals who've resigned themselves to being single for the rest of their lives.  They keep themselves busy so that they won't notice how lonely they really are.  Harvey writes piano compositions in his spare time.  Kate takes writing classes and is forever taking phone calls from her mother (Eileen Atkins), concerned about her daughter's spinsterhood.  The film has its requisite ""meet cute"" scene -- three in fact -- as Harvey and Kate coincidentally meet time after time in London, where Harvey is attending his daughter's wedding.  Despite its formulaic structure, ""Last Chance Harvey"" works because of its two stars, who have terrific on-screen chemistry.  We believe them as the characters they're playing and we go along for the pleasant ride.
Blu-ray extras include a making-of featurette and audio commentary with Hoffman, Thompson and writer/director Joel Hopkins.",1243209600,2,1022,5.506410256410256

With all the teen-age fluff put out by Hollywood it's nice to see a smart movie for a grown up audience. Hoffman is his usual charming and lovable self, while Thompson perfectly plays an intelligent but insecure woman approaching middle age. This is how life as a single adult (I was one until age 37) really feels and I could relate to these characters on a very profound level.

I suppose when I see a movie that's descibed as a romantic movie, I expect a somewhat uplifting story that makes me feel good. This movie was not that type of movie in my opinion. A large part at the start of the movie is dedicated to making the main characters look about as destitute and sad as possible, beyond the point where you can still imagine some kind of happy turnaround later. When the time comes for them to finally meet, the Harvey character seems to step out of character to a degree and become almost a quasi-stalker. Rather than being charming, he comes across as a pushy older guy looking to latch on to a younger female. I felt that there was very little chemistry between the two characters and seemingly little in common to attract them to one another other than their mutual status as sad and lonely people. Finally, it seemed like a lot of the aspects of the movie were sort of forced and not very realistic. It's hard to believe Harvey is a musician, that his daughter would be getting married in London, that he would be so spontaneous as to do all the things he does in the last half of the movie, that he could afford to just keep hanging out in expensive London hotels when he has obviously been down on his luck with his job, and the list goes on.

3146586,4,B0015OKWKS,"I love both Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and was very happy to see them in a quirky romance together.  It was a nice little film perfect for snuggling on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and relaxing with before bed.  It had just enough romance and heartache to interest the girls and enough laughs to keep the guys awake.

It is as someone said previously very formulaic.  I guessed what was going to happen in one scene before it did (read too many screenwriter books dear?) and completely astonished my spouse and son with my prescient announcement of the plot point that would impact the relationship of the charming couple.

Harvey is a jingle writer in New York who is so busy in the advertising business that he is anxious about leaving for London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is a lonely manager of a group of Marketers at Heathrow airport interviewing travelers as they arrive (I did this at Graceland once for a few extra bucks it isn't fun).  The two meet incidentally as a harried Harvey arrives and Kate is rebuffed by him.

Harvey arrives and finds his ex wife has hidden him off far away for he is somewhat of a selfish boor.  He meets his daughter and we can tell he loves her but seems to put business first.  After a series of embarrassments he decides he will leave right after the wedding.

Kate lives alone and is constantly harassed by her mother who needs a lot of attention (there is a comic subplot between the mom and a neighbor) and is constantly fixed up with blind dates by her coworkers.  She is very lonely but afraid of being hurt.

The two meet in the airport bar when Harvey misses his flight back to New York and will have to spend another day in the UK.  They strike up a conversation and find a mutual respect for one another.  Harvey too is lonely and depressed and decides to spend the day with her.

3146587,2,B0015OKWKS,"It's sad to see two brilliant actors like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson trying vainly to kick some life into this pallid romantic comedy that isn't very funny or romantic. What it is is entirely predictable, full of cliches and thoroughly mediocre.
Both these stars seem to have disappeared from movies recently. If they thought this tired vehicle would revive their flagging careers, they are dead wrong.
Hoffman plays a 60-something composer of advertising jingles down on his luck, flying to London to attend his daughter's wedding. When he arrives, he finds he's been shouldered out of his role as father of the bride by his ex-wife's second husband. To make matters worse, he's informed by phone he's lost his job.
Thompson is a 40-something, left on the shelf as love passes her by. The two meet up in an airport bar and strike up what the scriptwriters try to pretend is an attraction. Actually, there's no real chemistry between them; both are just reading their badly-written lines.

But in this movie, we both agreed that these two actors---Hoffman and Thompson ---were doing fine work and bringing spark and originality to what other reviewers have called a traditional romantic comedy.

Both these stars hit it just right, and director-writer Joel Hopkins lets them add just the right touch of realism ---like Thompson slowly getting ignored out on a blind date, and Hoffman getting insecure and lonely by himself --with initial loss of his bride-daughter to her step father, and sudden loss of his job.

By themselves they are not faring well, but together, they are like an army of 10. I really admired Thomson's Kate, who quickly helps Hoffman's Harvey reunite with his daughter, and the rest of the family.

Early on, I was pulling for these two people to make it ---in romantic London.  And worried that they might not, given the details that had to fall in place.

My wife was more realistic, but she too was in their corner.

So be sure to take this movie in, especially with someone close to you. It will be a fine evening, and you will wind up enriched and ready for the frustrations and surprises we all encounter almost every day.

3146590,3,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a Romantic Comedy, but different from its brethren because:

1. The man and woman in question are not glamorous-looking twenty-somethings.
2. They are in fact played by Academy Award winning performers.

Other than that ""Harvey"" has much in common.
1. There is a ""meet cute"".  All romantic comedies must have the ""boy-meets-girl"" scene, and since the leads are played by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, this scene is a little better than most.  This if followed by one of those genre montages where our couple walks blissfully around London getting to know each other, except that we hear the soundtrack and see their smiling faces rather than listen to their dialogue.  (If your movie stars Hoffman and Thompson, wouldn't you WANT them to be talking and smiling instead of just smiling?)
2. There is a scene where Harvey and Kate are supposed to meet for a ""second date"", and one of them is unable to make it for a reason that the other person would instantly understand if they only knew, but they don't know, leading the other person to think that they've been stood up.
3. There is a variation on my least favorite Romantic Comedy clich - the scene near the end when it looks like they're not going to be together, but the male character realizes he's making a Big Mistake and rushes to the airport to catch his destiny.  Most of the variation in THIS rendition of the clich comes because Kate WORKS at the airport, so Harvey has to meet her there.

Several romantic comedies have featured ""lovable losers"", but I suppose that the ""twist"" in this story is that Harvey has ""hit bottom"".  He wanted to be a jazz pianist, but his ability is only good enough to write music to accompany television commercials.  Even in this dreams-not-achieved world he is barely hanging onto his job as he flies to London for the wedding of his estranged daughter.  The daughter is completely assimilated into the world of the ex-wife and the step-father.  Harvey is an uncomfortable fish out of water.  Kate seems at least secure in her job as an airport poll-taker, although her social life's highlight is her mother, who phones about once an hour to describe the strange goings-on of her neighbor.

3146603,4,B0015OKWKS,"While visiting London for his daughter's wedding, American Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) has a series of disappointments.  He realizes that he's been a bad father, which is not surprising considering that he seems more interested in his job as a commercial songwriter.  When his job starts to fall apart too, he feels as though he has one final chance to set things straight in his life.  Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson), a 40-something singleton who feels as though she has one final chance - in her case it's to fall in love.  Unfortunately, she's not finding it on the blind dates her caring friends set up for her.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is a sweet, breezy romantic comedy.  What obviously sets it apart is the age of its leads; whereas most rom-coms feature ingenues in their 20s or early 30s (often matched with an older actor), Thompson is 49 and Hoffman is 71 years old.  Falling in love at their age, with a lifetime of prior disappointments behind them, feels risky to them.  It's not like being young and being able to abandon one's self to love.  Thompson in particular perfectly captures this sense of desperation mixed with fear of being hurt and humiliated.  She is luminous and totally believable as the star of a rom-com, although one who's been around the block a few times.  As is typical for movies, she is paired with an older actor; how interesting it would have been to have an actor closer to her age, but that's a minor quibble.

The movie is filled with gentle, insightful humor.  The subplot with Thompson's xenophobic mother (Dame Eileen Atkins) was amusing but seemed disconnected from the main plot and detracted somewhat from the movie.  Otherwise, ""Last Chance Harvey"" is pitch perfect throughout.  Second-time director Joel Hopkins (""Jump Tomorrow"") wisely keeps things very simple, and the movie's relatively short run time also helps keep things interesting.  There's nothing terribly unique about ""Last Chance Harvey,"" but it's so well acted and genuine that it scores an easy bull's eye.",1241740800,5,2025,4.894428152492669

3146605,4,B0015OKWKS,"It seems these days that theaters across the country are filled with the latest blockbuster, always a techno touch of wizardry that titillate the audience while at the same time offering total entertainment but little meat to the bones. But occasionally a film comes along that deals with emotions, usually a small film without major pizzazz. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is such a film and one worth seeing.

Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer for a large advertising firm. Out of touch with the electronic music era and more in touch with actual instruments, Harvey is the last of his kind, so much so that if his latest account doesn't sell he's out of work.

This particular weekend Harvey is to fly to London for his daughter's wedding. Divorced from her mother for some time, one gets the feeling that Harvey was always more concerned with career than family. His daughter's closeness to her mother and step father proves this later on.

Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is a 40something woman who works for a survey company asking questions of travelers as they disembark from their planes in London. Kate constantly has to take care of her mother either by visit or via cell phone non stop. It is through her job that she first bumps into Harvey as he abruptly brushes her off.

Harvey hits the hotel booked for him only to find out that everyone else is staying in a house his ex-wife has booked for the entire party. He does finally get the chance to be with the wedding party though as they gather the night before the wedding. Hoffman's Harvey gets to show off his somewhat out of place character as he takes cell phone calls for work and stumbles about, both physically and verbally. It is on this night that Harvey's daughter informs him that she intends to have her step father (played by James Brolin) to walk her down the aisle. Crushed but understanding, Harvey retreats to his room.

The next day Harvey has the chance to see his daughter married, but has to return home for a business meeting thus missing the reception. Due to traffic he misses his plane and is summarily fired by his boss. While having a drink he bumps into Kate once again who acts stand offish but eventually sees something nice in Harvey. The pair spend the day together as Harvey invites himself into her life, eventually inviting her into his when he asks her to accompany him to the reception.

The pair makes a nice fit. Both have been up and down in the world of romance and both have battle scars to prove it. But at the reception Harvey gets a chance to come out of his shell, winning back his daughter's affection and perhaps the heart of a woman he just met.

The title of the film sums it up. This is Harvey's last chance. Not just at the job he has (though hates, wishing he was a jazz piano player instead) but life as well. He may have lost his old family, but a chance at romance that blossoms naturally with someone he's just met makes for a heartwarming story that captures the essence of what love is all about.

Not the love we seems to find offered all the time in films these days where teenage angst and romance involves who can get whom into bed first, but a deeper more meaningful affection that will last when the physical passion retreats. The emotions shared between the characters of Harvey and Kate, two people who meet and fall in love in a day, is something that perhaps older viewers can relate to better. Too bad younger ones will miss this one for the next teen pop tart, never realizing what true love is all about.

Hoffman has always done a fantastic job. He turns in a subtle performance here, one that I think is better than I've seen from him in recent years. He's relaxed in the skin of Harvey Shine. Thompson does an upstanding job as well, bringing the woman on the verge of spinsterhood alive as she sees an opportunity present itself but at the same time fears the consequences should it fail, while loss of love inflicts pain on everyone, loss of love at the later stages of life offers more mortal wounds.

This movie was missed by many when it hit theaters. It is one of the joys of DVD releases that the opportunity to see something as special as this presents itself. Theaters offer 18 screens, 12 of which offer the same 3 blockbuster films. Movies like this get lost in the shuffle. Not so when it comes to DVD.

So pick up LAST CHANCE HARVEY. Sit down with someone you care for and enjoy it. Give them a hug or two. And thanks to DVD, this won't be the last chance you get to see a film that deserved more attention.",1241481600,6,4561,4.463385354141657

""Romantic comedy""? WHAT comedy? I kept waiting for something funny to happen... maybe something worth even chuckling at... something to even stimulate a fleeting smile???

It was like watching water while waiting for it to come to a boil. Without the stove turned on....

""Comedy"" takes at least some energy for it to be successful. This was the anti-energy movie. The black hole of energy. It should be classified as an energy disaster and a drain on the world's energy resources. The EPA should ban it.

I kept thinking that at SOME point this molasses-slow mess would start picking up. Nope! Never happened! After feeling like I'd spent over half my life staring at the screen, I saw that 52 minutes of the approximately 1.5 hours of this bomb had gone by without ONE DARNED THING happening, and that's when I decided I'd rather suck car exhaust or watch my lawn grow than put up with any more of this waste of the planet's resources.

3146608,1,B0015OKWKS,"(1.) I figured out why Hoffman (Harvey) seems to always be in movies about dysfunctional males. In fact, he's now typecast to do similar voiceovers in children's animations. It's because when the cliched story is old and tiresome you need someone who is a natural sounding bumbling character. That makes the movie and character believable and thus easier to swallow.
(2.) The movie as a whole is one unrealistic scene after another that includes Harvey in a parking garage where a phone call from his boss says he lost his job; he lost the love of his wife and older daughter for reasons not clear; he makes everyday decision mistake after mistake as the movie plods on. And Emma, an attractive, engaging, intelligent middle age woman has never had a serious relationship - sure! It's difficult to have any empathy for a story about misfortune that reads like a cheap romance novelette. You keep waiting for some unique and interesting development to occur to mark it as different from all the similar movies but you keep waiting and waiting while the slowly evolving improbable chain of events unfold and the  monologues continue to be simplistic and predictable.

Thompson is perfect as well, for her roll, and they have a great chemistry in the movie.  It's a very believable movie, with very real actors.  Of course, you find yourself rooting for Dustin, the lovable loser character, and even though you know it will turn out in favor of the good guy, you'll just feel good when it's over.

3146612,4,B0015OKWKS,"LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a totally predictable, yet very charming romantic comedy that works because of the immense likability of its two stars, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.

New Yorker Dustin and Londoner Emma are two strangers who lead lonely, unhappy lives.  He's a frustrated composer, musician, making a good living writing jingles for commercials, while she conducts polls at the London airport, while dealing with a dotty mother (Eileen Atkins) who thinks that her new neighbor is a serial killer.

When Dustin, his job hanging by a thread, flies to London to attend his somewhat estranged daughter's wedding, he and Emma meet by chance.

There is instant chemistry between them and, over the course of a day, they have such an effect on each other that both their lives are completely turned around.

As previously stated, there's nothing particularly unique about the story.  This is just a ""feel good"" movie.

Kathy Baker, James Brolin and Richard Schiff co-star in the picture, written and directed by Joel Hopkins.

The 2-disc set includes audio commentary by the director and stars, a ""Making of"" featurette and more.

3380851,5,B0015OKWKS,"That was once an observation about my preferences in movies, that I enjoyed stories that seemed like they might happen to you, could happen, and were just about nothing really. And after spending the afternoon in Camarillo, CA in an art theater of very senior citizens in audience I think many felt it might happen too, because they gave a nice small gentle applause.
Even with their canes, assistants and wheelchair gear (noted to me by my companion holding up  my poorly performing leg so I could hobble in) we were an older crew.

What was the movie? Hum. The story of a man, a jazz piano commercial jingle writer, coping with a pressure sounding job nightmare in a digitizing universe, going to London to see his daughter be married. His name is Harvey Shine, that is interesting because of course he is just Dustin Hoffman reprising himself as a romantic duffer, struggling with the job, with the marriage of a daughter he's lost to a divorce long ago, as she folded into her mother's remarriage. He's put up at a hotel, away from the entire family, apart, odd wheel. It carries so well those outsider feelings of this man, that has a daughter who doesn't seem to know him too well, that he later will say in a conversation in the film she always seemed a bit embarrassed by him, as he notes he had a child within something that never was quite right. Never right. It took a toll, one he obviously regrets,it hurts,  but he knows another price had to be paid by his child who has almost become another man's child. Hard, impossible to verbalize. We miss in life on many things.  In a series of hits and misses he then at this same time runs into Emma Thompson, oops Kate Walker I think, working for the airline, struggling with her own anxieties about her own scene of awkwardly attempting meeting someone, with nervous apprehension-anxieties over this. And as it seems to happen sometimes, he rebuffs her (ironically on his plane flight he was rebuffed by a passenger not interested in his chat) turns from her and some airline survey, only later to find himself after a horrible day running back into her at the airport as he fails to get the plane and get out of there to an essential work meeting. And finding a rapport then, a shift in the mind and heart, I think he can see her now. See her. After he's lost enough to understand when he is found.
Or has found. Seeing.

It reminded me somehow of years ago when I was in my early twenties. Just a vague familiarity.  A Cuban man drove me from the airport to a hotel down close to the Modern. A nice cabbie that talked and calmed a very fear-filled kid trying to figure out her life. Just a kind man. That's all. I was very nervous, unsure where I was, he was a great help, and I must have just told him I was afraid of not having too much money so I couldn't afford to pay more than thirty dollars. I was afraid of being overcharged. I know he didn't do that, my funds were so limited. I told him that. And I tipped him. I think he helped me get a room at a place I could afford. There is a point. A few days later I ran into him at Central Park at a festival. He and I just happily chatted like friends as he played some gaming thing on a day I needed to feel safer. It's a small world but this movie reminds me of how sometimes life hugs you in a very small corner. It allows you to listen to the tune played on the jazz piano. It gives you the blessing of a nice glass of rose.( I cannot figure out the accent on that e)  And someone might actually wait for you to finish your class, as this new acquaintance does for Kate, or even walks with you all night or takes the risk to follow where someone leads. Or takes a hand or asks a favor.

Actually I've read the plot summarized here and at on-line movie sites ten times or more, when debating whether or not to risk my going out walking with such serious problems going on underfoot, so it isn't what I'd want to say-another synopsis. It wouldn't get it anyway. He goes to the wedding, is hurt by being replaced by the step dad told by the daughter in walking her down the aisle, meets this interesting, wary and lovely woman, loses his job, takes a risk, suffers a arrhythmia, almost misses a chance that he needs, she needs. And then there is her mom, calmly wondering if the neighbor is smoking bodies in the shed.
It's a little cozy movie about the lovely warmth of holding a hand and strolling into the life of another, because it's just righter than retreat.

I loved the littlest things. That there is some very old man in her writing class reading his sexual passages, that Harvey collapses when made to walk the kazillion flights of stairs at his hotel in London, both elevators off, that Emma Thompson wears this lovely silk lined raincoat so beautifully, that he goes to the pre wedding dinner with a white linen suit, crumpled with the tag not removed by the store, you know those inky ones, that they allow us to feel all the awkward staring discomfort, that Kate rolls up a little jacket or sweater to put under a child's head when they are belatedly seated at a child's table after the wedding at the reception. That he plays her a tune on the piano and asks her to stay, calming her discomfort knowing his own. That he gives her, and she him, the benefit of the doubt. That Kate goes to the rail with such anxiety when he tells her he's there, going to be there, why he missed her, and she sits and looks and admits to all the real fear of being hurt.

And he just absorbs that, and says he won't let her down.

I wish I could write to do it justice. It's small and it's everything. Lovely film.",1240012800,17,5625,4.302171860245514

The story: New York jingle-writer Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is on his last legs in a job that's passing him by, and he tears himself away from the daily crisis to attend his daughter's wedding in London. Long divorced, Harvey hasn't been close to his daughter and he's very much on the outside among the wedding party. His daughter has asked her step-father (James Brolin) to give her away. Harvey bags the reception, misses a plane home, gets fired over the phone, and takes refuge in a pub.

Meanwhile Kate Walker (Thompson) is cruising toward spinsterhood, at her quirky mother's beck and call; she has bagged a bad blind date and is--oh, can you guess?--taking refuge in the same pub. Overture, rebuff, repeat.

These two lonely souls somehow, in spite of a script full of lame repartee, get together and tell their stories. Kate is horrified that Harvey is missing his daughter's reception and insists that he attend. He tows her along. Harvey, although seated at the children's table, rises to the occasion and all is happy.

Well, it's not quite that simple, but nearly. The lead actors give their usual excellent performances but the romantic tension just isn't there. Writer/director Joel Hopkins delivers a movie that's pleasant enough but not memorable, except for the recurring scenes in which Kate's mother spies on her new neighbor of whom she is highly suspicious. Don't leave before the credits roll, or you will miss the final scene in this play-within-a-play.

This was not a terrible way to spend ninety minutes on an airplane, but it's not a movie I'd yearn to see again; just a little too wordy and lacking in plausibility. But I WOULD like to watch the wedding scene one more time, to find out if my brain at sea level would once again channel ""The Graduate"" while watching Dustin Hoffman at his daughter's wedding.

3380853,5,B0015OKWKS,"Beautifully acted, a well crafted story and film, Last Chance Harvey may well become a classic of its time.

Other reviews will give you the bare bones of this story. Many will be somewhat disappointed. There are no crash, bang, wallops, no magical special effects, no deaths, no wild sex scenes, and no wacky out-of-this-world crazy characters. The emotions of Last Chance Harvey lie subtly between the lines, behind the faade; in the traditions of English and French literary cinema. Last Chance Harvey comes from the stable of such classics as Notting Hill, which successfully cross over to an American audience. After the 'B' movie disaster films of Hoffman's mid-life career, it is good to see Dustin back, again, in a character deserving of his acting skill.

Look for instance at the gentle nostalgia. 'Hello lamppost what you knowing?' Last Chance Harvey gently acts the feelings of many baby-boomers who missed or got emotionally screwed the liberated 60's and now face their last chance of finding happiness in their golden years. Watch the flower growing. Last Chance Harvey is a maturely romantic comedy. Dig out the gem of Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Waters.' If you are not old enough to do that, then read on and learn to avoid the mistakes of your generation.

Every generation repeats the patterns and mistakes of the past. Men sell their creative souls to the commercial machine. Dustin Hoffman's character dreamt of being a jazz pianist but instead spent a life writing advertising jingles. The kind of music John Lennon disparagingly described as 'musac'. Competing in a stressful demanding world,  such men neglect the relationships that are most important to all. Their children. Last Chance Harvey stands as a judgement by a generation on the `gift' of easy divorce. Sacrifices made for a career, only to find oneself dumped on the scrap heap of ageism.

Emma Thompson's character is a spinster whose life is ruled by a demanding dependent mother. Thompson's mother is a cancer survivor crippled by the psychological effects of impending death. Seeing death everywhere, she is fearful of time apart from her daughter.

Surely in this age, intelligent independent women are liberated from such self-sacrifice. Surely there are treatments, places to care, for the aged? Reality is different, even today. Can any generation abandon its parents?

Sometimes the chains of dependency are self-imposed. Thompson's character is just as dependent on her mother. It protects her from repeating the greatest mistake of her life.

Last Chance Harvey is story of loss. Loss of loved ones, of unborn children; loss of career; self-concept; the loss of innocence, loss of the romantic dreams of adolescence, and the loss of a caring society. `Don't leave me here', is Dustin's unspoken plea to a perfect stranger. Not in this place in life.

In the days of instant gratification, uncontrolled consumption, thoughtless greed and instant celebrity, Last Chance Harvey even laments the loss of skills and the pleasure of craft. The writer's group is not just a device to create anxiety in the separation of characters falling in love; it is also a device to illustrate a theme. A world that thinks creativity exists without the hard earned skills of craft.

In these recessionary days, when so many dreams are shattered, Last Chance Harvey tells us all there is still a chance if only we get our priorities right.

Last Chance Harvey may not make you shed a tear, but it will give you hope. The hope we all need to believe we will see our way out of the gloom and despondency of recession. For that reason, Last Chance Harvey may become a classic of its time. And Emma Thompson continues to show she is one of the greatest English actresses of our time.

3380854,4,B0015OKWKS,"By no means do I damn with faint praise when suggesting that this is a ""small"" film. Rather, only to suggest that it covers a brief period of time (a few days), in a single setting (London), focuses primarily on only two characters, and there few plot developments. Briefly, Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is employed by an advertising agency in Manhattan as a jingle writer when we are introduced to him. Almost immediately we sense that he is dissatisfied with both his career (he would prefer to earn a living as a jazz composer and performer) and with the current state of his life (he is divorced and apparently alienated from his adult daughter, Susan, who is about to be married in London). The title refers to both situations: Charley is advised by his boss Marvin (Richard Schiff who played the character Toby Ziegler on the television program, The West Wing) that his job is in jeopardy. After a very brief encounter upon arrival at Heathrow Airport with Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) seeking to obtain travel information from passengers, Harvey is saddened to learn from Susan (Liane Balaban) that she has decided that her stepfather Brian (James Brolin) will accompany her down the aisle. Of course, Harvey encounters Kate again and then....

The acting is outstanding. The setting is especially appropriate for what happens to a troubled New Yorker, among strangers in a strange city, at a time when he is running out of options in all areas of his life. Kate has concerns of her own but seems less troubled, probably because she fulfills at least some needs by comforting and reassuring her mother Maggie Walker (Eileen Atkins) who calls her constantly throughout the day (and evening), concerned about trivial matters. We know almost nothing else about Kate's private life, other than the absence of romance and few (if any) chances of finding it. She clearly does not wish to be hurt and is sensibly reluctant to become involved with anyone, even a stranger who is clearly unhappy, feels rejected, and in need of attention and kindness.

Five Star ratings of films should be reserved for ""classics"" and that is especially true of romantic comedies such as It Happened One Night, Little Shop Around the Corner, Sleepless in Seattle, and You've Got Mail. Last Chance Harvey is not in their class. However, I think Hoffman and Thompson are not only superb but have charming chemistry, the film is well-made, respectful of awkward adult situations with potentially serious consequences, and arrives at its happy ending with a pleasing plausibility.",1237507200,32,2557,4.958041958041958
3380855,2,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a tale of redemption on many levels.  Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is about to lose his job in advertising to a younger hand,  he's also about to lose his daughter Susan (Liane Balaban) to her new husband, and he's getting close to losing himself as well.

It's kismet that he meets Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a British woman in similar circumstances.  And it's literally his third chance to do so that he recognizes her.

They strike up a friendship despite their mutual angst and Kate helps Harvey by attending Susan's wedding reception.  This is the story that the film's trying to tell. I honestly can't say why they didn't quite score a hit with it. I love both Thompson and Hoffman and I wanted to like this pairing, but nothing about the two of them together really made me think they were a couple at all.  Perhaps if they played this as more of a British comedy than an American and created more tension between the two of them, it might have worked better.

The subplot, Kate's senior Mom (Eileen Atkins) who drives Kate crazy by calling dozens of times a day, had me riveted to the screen each time she came on. This woman's obsession with her new Polish neighbor who she watches out her back window is fascinating. The Easter Egg at the end of the credits showing the two of them finally meeting was worth sitting through hte whole film listening to the two senior guys behind me snoring. This is the plot I wished they'd pursued and it's the funniest part of the whole film.

Like the far superior ""Something's Gotta Give,"" Joel Hopkins` ""Last Chance Harvey"" is that rare movie romance in which the main characters have less time ahead of them than they have behind them.  This means that they come loaded down with far more serious baggage than their whippersnapper counterparts in most such stories.

Harvey's burden is that he's a songwriter who's pretty much hit the bottom-of-the-barrel in his professional life - he writes jingles for television commercials - and who's long since given up his dream of ever becoming a world-class jazz pianist.  He's also a failure as a parent, finding himself all but estranged from his twenty-something daughter who so prefers her stepfather to her real father that she's chosen the former to walk her down the aisle at her wedding.  Kate is an employee at Heathrow Airport who spends most of her free time taking care of her high maintenance aging mother and being roped into going on pathetic blind dates that invariably leave her feeling unfulfilled, crushed and vulnerable.  It is when Harvey travels to London to attend his daughter's wedding - where he is treated like a virtual outcast - that his and Kate's paths eventually cross.  Discouraged and lonely, Harvey and Kate begin a tentative friendship that promises to bloom into a full-fledged romance by the end of the picture.

Since love stories centered around later-life couples are indeed such an anomaly, it becomes doubly sad to have to report that ""Last Chance Harvey"" turns out to be a decidedly innocuous, low-wattage affair overall.  Although the movie runs for a scant ninety minutes, literally a full half hour passes before Harvey and Kate share any real screen time together.  This means that the entire romance has to be crammed into a mere hour's worth of time, a feat that no actors - not even two of the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson - could reasonably be expected to pull off.  The script deserves credit for not over-dramatizing its scenes and for being willing to allow the romance to unfold without a great deal of hoopla and fanfare.  But the result, paradoxically, is that this very lack of urgency and energy winds up draining much of the life out of the film.

Lucky for us, we do have two old pros like Hoffman and Thompson to make the movie seem better than it is - though it's a bit farfetched to try to pass the lovely and witty Thompson off as a woman who can't land herself a man.  It's also a bit unfortunate that the final scenes begin to seem like ""The Graduate: Forty Years Later,"" as a now much older Hoffman races around the city trying to get himself back in the good graces of the woman he loves.

Hoffman and Thompson make for an inspired pairing, but beyond their performances, ""Last Chance Harvey"" evaporates from memory not too long after we've seen it.",1233100800,5,2844,4.740365111561866
3380857,4,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) is a mess. Fearful he is about to lose his job, he rushes to the airport to catch a plane to London; his daughter is getting married to her fianc&eacute;e and he can't miss the wedding, his relationship with his daughter is already strained to the point of bursting. When he arrives, he realizes he has been relegated to 'Guest' status and his cell phone continues to ring at inopportune times. But the real blow comes when his daughter announces her step-dad (James Brolin) will give her away. Harvey can't stand it and leaves the wedding before the reception. Returning to Heathrow to miss his flight, he sits down in an airport bar and finds Kate (Emma Thompson), an airport employee enjoying a glass of wine, her nose buried in a new paperback. They strike up a reluctant conversation and Harvey is intrigued. It takes a while, but Kate is just as intrigued and they start to talk and walk around London.

""Last Chance Harvey"", written and directed by Joel Hopkins, is a charming romance, a good showcase for the talents of the two leads and a very, very imperfect film saved only by Hoffman and Thompson. Ultimately, it is a nice little bit of fluff that you will no doubt forget. You'll have one of those conversations in a few months. ""Did you see that film with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson?"" ""No, which one? ""Love, Actually""?"" ""No, Hoffman wasn't in that. The other one.""

The saving grace of the film are the performances from Hoffman and Thompson. I read that both insisted there be limited rehearsals, allowing for the characters to improvise and seem even more natural. Hoffman plays Harvey, a real mess of a guy who is about to lose his job and his daughter and makes a real botched effort trying to save his relationship with both. He rushes to London for her wedding, making the return flight for two days later. When he tells his daughter he will miss the reception, it seems to be the final straw and she drops a bombshell on him. Her step-dad will give her away. When she tells Harvey this, you can tell she is heartbroken because her relationship with her dad is so strained. When he hears the news, you can almost see Harvey's heart break, as Hoffman's face registers a wave of emotion, the feelings briefly flashing across his face.

As soon as the wedding is over, he bolts, rushing back to Heathrow, but he also seems relieved to be away from the crushing emotional memories. When he realizes he has missed his flight, he finds himself in a weird purgatory; he can't do anything about his job and doesn't feel like doing anything about his daughter and the disconnect from her life. He slumps into an airport bar and orders a drink. Airport employee Kate (Emma Thompson) is enjoying a meal after her shift and the two begin talking. Kate, younger than Harvey, is intrigued by the American and he offers to walk with her to her next appointment.

Let's backtrack a bit and look at Kate's life for a few moments. She works at Heathrow, managing a group of women who greet incoming passengers and get statistical information for them. Each of the women she works with desperately wants her to find a companion, so much so that one of them asks her to go out on a blind date. She and her boyfriend will be there, so she doesn't have anything to worry about. But Kate's life, and her love life in particular, are hampered by her mom (Eileen Atkins), a needy single woman who seems to have her finger poised above speed dial at all times. She calls Kate constantly and interrupts many conversations she has with others, including potential mates. The blind date doesn't go well and Kate becomes particularly unhappy. But she puts on a stiff upper lip and goes to work and continues to deal with her mom, bottling up her emotions and pushing on.

What makes this work, and elevates the material above television movie status, are the performances from the two leads. Both Hoffman and Thompson are such good actors that when they receive material like this, they know how to make every moment seem real and believable. Hoffman really seems to lose himself inn the role and we see fifty years of Harvey's life factor into every conversation and decision he has and makes throughout the film. When he arrives in London and takes a taxi to the hotel, he calls his daughter. ""Where are all of you?"" ""Oh. Your mom rented a house."" ""No, I'm OK. I'll be fine here."" We don't need to hear the other side of the conversation to see all of the pain and conflict Harvey experiences or to understand the thoughts racing through his head as he tries to make his daughter feel OK. Why couldn't your mom put her feelings aside for a few days and include me in this momentous part of your life? Why couldn't you say something about it? But I love you too much to make a fuss and will stay put here at the hotel.

In every scene, Hoffman does similar things with Harvey, revealing new things about him, his relationship with his ex and his daughter, about his life. Each of these revelations is revealed through facial expressions, or the lack of, brief little looks, his eyes, and body language. What is really interesting about this character is that Hoffman reveals so much by contradicting what Harvey is saying with little movements, or ticks, or gestures that tell us he is trying to make everyone else feel OK and he doesn't care about his feelings and wants his daughter to think everything is OK.

Thompson is Hoffman's equal and she brings as much depth and interest to her character, Kate. We get the sense there is great pain in Kate because her ever present smile seems greatly strained, ready to plaster a smile across her face to keep her mom from asking too many questions and to keep her co-workers and friends from getting too involved in her life.

When Kate and Harvey meet, each seems to loosen a little bit and Kate's defenses seem to crumble. She is intrigued by the forward American and agrees to walk with him. Each time she tries to pull away, he insists that they continue walking or talking and she gives in. What makes this so poignant is that she doesn't really put up a fight. She is merely protesting for appearances sake.

As they walk and talk, Kate learns a lot about Harvey, and vice versa, and what brought him to this stage. She asks ""Is the reception still going on?"" And he immediately decides to ask her to go. As they spend more and more time together, they realize the unconventional aspects of their relationship, everything that should make it not work, are the reasons they are each intrigued by the budding relationship.

It is really a delight to watch two actors, each so accomplished in their craft, at the top of their skills, create two people who are so intrigued by one another.

There is a subplot involving Kate's mom (Eileen Atkins), which seems wasted. She is a big part of Kate's life and calls her on a constant basis. Then, she begins to have suspicions about a new neighbor. These moments seem to point to a fairly funny subplot. When that part of the story fails to payoff, you have to wonder what was the point in investing so much time in this character. It seems misleading somehow.

And the film has a very small scope. This isn't a bad thing, in and of itself, but when you begin to experience the depth of Hoffman and Thompson's performances, you begin to hope for more. Eileen Atkins' character promises something funny, but when this fails to materialize, what else is there? Because so much of the film concentrates on the two characters, it begins to feel like a film adapted from a play. We have seen films adapted from plays before. Some seem better than the play because they take advantage of the new medium, film, and present a story more expansive than the original material. And others seem too restricted by the source material, presenting many dialogues between two or three characters, never leaving the confines of a 'stage'. When a film that wasn't based on a play seems like it was, that is a problem.

And this problem makes the otherwise enjoyable ""Last Chance Harvey"" problematic.",1232841600,,8096,4.586731167933656
3380858,4,B0015OKWKS,"I, too, went to a pre-release screening of this movie.  Nobody would say this is a great or classic romance movie, nor would anyone say it is particularly innovative.  However, it does have a few qualities in its favor.  I don't see why it is rated PG-13 because there is refreshingly little bad language, and the closest to a sex scene is a short kiss in a public park.  For 'traditional values' families this should be a big plus.  It is almost a relief to see a movie where the couple merely agrees to keep seeing each other rather than running to the nearest hotel for sex.  One scene that should appeal greatly to Roman Catholics and most Protestants is a scene where Kate laments for having had an abortion while still in university.  How often have you seen that in a modern movie?

If you want to see a classic romance or a life-changing movie, this is probably not a good choice.  However, if you would like to spend a pleasant ninety minutes for entertainment that only occasionally, and then mildly, contravenes traditional family or religious values, then you probably won't be disappointed.  A romance this wholesome doesn't come along too often these days.",1231718400,,1170,4.663414634146341
3380859,4,B0015OKWKS,"Watching ""Last Chance Harvey,"" I began to think about other such films and realized that I usually referred to them in my reviews as classic romantic comedies. But what exactly do I mean when I say that? In all likelihood, I mean that readers should go easy on the film because we're used to those movies following a very specific formula, and never mind the fact that they're contrived and clich. I could very well call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy, because goodness knows it adheres to a tried and true structure. In spite of that, this is the one romantic comedy of 2008 that works the best, in large part because of stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson; whereas other filmmakers would cast young, energetic actors in a story about sex, writer/director Joel Hopkins has cast two older actors in a story is about love. Because they're more experienced, they actually bring something to the table. They seem genuine as people.

But more importantly, they have chemistry, not necessarily as lovers but definitely as companions. In other words, it seems plausible that such people could meet in real life and fall in love. Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer from New York who always wanted to be a jazz pianist. It was easy for me to empathize with him, a somber, soft-spoken man who always feels ignored in a large crowd. Maybe there's a part of him that wanted it that way; he's been known to embarrass himself and those closest to him, so at a certain point, it's better to just stay out of the way. He openly admits that he wasn't the greatest father or husband, and while there's no hostility between him or his daughter and ex-wife, there is a quiet yet prominent sense of disappointment on all accounts. And now, no one at his music company seems to be taking him seriously. More to the point, he's on the verge of losing his job.

When Harvey flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding, he meets a Heathrow employee named Kate Walker (Thompson), who, as it turns out, is stuck in her own emotional rut. She says she would like nothing more than to meet someone and start a relationship, but since she's been let down so many times, she may be getting used to it. Later on in the film, she admits that being disappointed is more comfortable that being hurt. Much like Harvey, she also feels ignored in crowds, as when she's on a blind date that starts off well but ends up as a social gathering that leaves her off in the sidelines. Her only social outlets are her coworkers and her mother (Eileen Atkins), an interesting character herself; she calls Kate constantly, pretty much to the point of insanity, and she seems to think her Polish next-door neighbor is a mass murderer who burns his victims in a large barbecue shed.

Harvey and Kate spend a wonderful afternoon together, and this is despite the fact that they don't know very much about each other. We don't know if a love is developing at this point, but it's clear that a friendship is. While a bit quiet and reserved, Harvey is kind towards Kate, and he seems genuinely interested in what she has to say. Kate is willing to go along with it, although her nervous smiles and hesitant laughter suggest that she has absolutely no idea why any of this is happening. From out of nowhere comes a charming American man, and even though he has a lot of emotional baggage, there's the sense that she's interested in helping him deal with it. Most likely, that's because she has baggage of her own; after convincing her to join him at his daughter's wedding reception, there comes a point when she feels exactly the same as she did the night of her blind date. It's up to Harvey to make her feel like she can be a part of the crowd.

There are some interesting moments between Harvey and his daughter, Susan (Liane Balaban). Even though they love each other in the strictest sense, they are more good friends than they are father and daughter, which is why she wants her stepfather, Brian (James Brolin), to give her away at the wedding. Harvey is understandably hurt, but he can't stay mad at Brian forever; after all, he did take over for Harvey when his marriage failed, giving Susan the stability and attention she needed. This would be a tiresome story were Brian made to be vindictive and hostile. Thankfully, he isn't--he's decent and accommodating, a fact Harvey most likely has trouble accepting. There are few things worse than disliking someone without having a reason.

So yes, I guess I can call ""Last Chance Harvey"" a classic romantic comedy. But that doesn't automatically make it a bad movie. What really made it work well was the thoughtful relationship between Harvey and Kate, which isn't based on physical attraction so much as it's based on the need to be loved. We don't get too much of that in romantic comedies these days. Even the entertaining ""Definitely, Maybe"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl"" were only committed to catering to younger audiences, which is a shame because the filmmakers missed some great opportunities to develop the characters at a more mature level. ""Last Chance Harvey"" gives its characters some degree of believability, and this is in spite of the story's formulaic elements. I greatly enjoyed this film, and I'm sure most audiences will also.",1230681600,98,5282,4.669172932330827

3380861,4,B0015OKWKS,"I like this film because it captures the spirit of love and of lament.... It is an interesting story that begins to unravel from one third of the way into filming....it contemplates the prospect of love with two individuals: a man and a woman who seem to be lost in the anguish of love, and slightly heartbroken in desire of affection. But it is a light and pleasant comedy that is set in the fast-paced location of London.

I admire Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson who co-star together in a very fine and well crafted story, in a light hearted romance that will eventually fall under the old formula of... boy meets girl - boy losses girl  and then again....

A fine film indeed  Dustin Hoffman is the very star, but sometimes wobbles in character in our thoughts Does he have solvency to be in a classy style to pursue his romance in London... There is some doubt because there are niggles of worry about his personal wealth in stability of his present day employment as a jingles composer?

I actually think that Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as the American....as an afterthought of actor replacements, I rather think that Richard Gere, for example, would be too soppy, or that Al Pacino too electrifying and magnetic in character of the American?

I have not extended into plot or story detail as the film intrigues me in the knowledge that life is usually more upbeat with distractions to really soul search the heart without being too sad  it is worth viewing....

  *********

I am surprised that Dustin Hoffman starred perhaps he wanted to have fun in London -he looked pretty cool - playing an American in attendance to his daughters wedding....a rich American or perhaps a struggling one -once again, he had not secured a new contract for his jingles music? Emma Thompson was delightful as always but looking a bit weary of life she is a good actress! Im sure she wanted to follow Dustin Hoffmans star attraction to join him in lead role?

Both characters - I think - were in the same public bar when Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are portrayed separately in the opening film sequences. They are in character a bit distraught of life and love....they never get to meet together until later on - and this is what I truly liked about the film  whether or not they would ever meet ...or was it to be an interesting story of two separate lives?

  *********

This is a lovely and light hearted reflection of love in contrast of the loneliness of London without the support of connection...The script is enough to be equally intelligent to life. I greatly admire Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson for taking on their roles of this light comedy.

It may be a light comedy of romantic love but it enhances the desire to be together when circumstances dictate, and affect the mental control of anguish in a lonely existence...it is well scripted, and works from an intelligent script that is beyond my own powers in anticipation of writing one myself?

Ironically, I read the screenplay and used a number of scenes for the acting for the camera scene study class I teach at the college.  I think I was discouraged to watch by the number of calamities that befall the hapless character of Harvey Shine in the first part of the film.  What I found as I watched was that I really fell in love with these two characters played Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson as the British Kate Walker.  The film is a delightful romantic journey of the two.  It shows how well deserved were the Golden Globe nominations for each of the two leads.  The supporting characters are also delightful.  Eileen Atkins who was in ""Cold Mountain"" does a great job as Kate's mother, bothered by the handyman new neighbor next door.  As mother Maggie, Atkins has a knack to always intrude on Kate at the most awkward moments.  Kathy Baker who I most remember as Joe's mother on one of my favorite TV series, ""Medium,"" plays Harvey's ex who seems to smugly belittle him at every turn.  I found the DVD extras to be tremendously informative.  It talks about how the project was created, how Dustin and Emma had previously worked together but with limited screen time, and how the great chemistry they felt from that experience translated well to ""Last Chance Harvey.""  This was Joel Hopkins' second film; and he let the actors improvise to a great extent, which gives the film a real spark and intense truthfulness in performance.

Harvey and Kate meet accidentally - twice - and the second time is a charm.  He is visiting from America and she is a resident Brit.

3380917,5,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey is a psychologically savvy romantic comedy about Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) and Kate (Emma Thompson).  Harvey, a would-be jazz musician who writes commercial jingles, is being replaced by young techies.  He arrives in London for his daughter's wedding to learn that she has asked her stepfather to give her away.  Kate lives close to her clinging mother and has a job conducting surveys at Heathrow airport.  She seems too old to hang out with the trendy bar crowd but too young to give up on the singles scene altogether.  There's nothing wrong with Harvey or Kate; they just don't belong where they are.  But belong together they do, even though, as in most romantic comedies, it is not easy to get them together.  But with Hoffman and Thompson the ride is deliciously sublime.  Give these two a decent script (and this one is good enough) and they will break your heart.  (And then warmly put it back together.)",1348704000,,930,4.7625

When the film focuses on Hoffman and Thompson (both in fine form), their budding friendship and the time they spend together, then it is charming and appealing. Unfortunately, there are too many awkward and embarrassing moments during the first 30 minutes before they meet, and there are too many subplots: the one involving the mother and her suspicions about her neighbor is totally extraneous. The wonderful Eileen Atkins is completely wasted. In fact, the film-makers could have gotten the point across quite well--a dependent relative stifling a child--using the device of a frequent cell phone caller who is never seen. Why not just let these two wonderful actors do what they do best - act out their initial tentativeness and the increasing ease they find with each other as they spend more time together. We should be hearing what they have to say to each other, but instead, too often the camera pans away from them, where it should be, and the focus switches to their surroundings. Not a major disappointment, but a disappointment nevertheless.",1342742400,,1196,4.925742574257426
3380920,3,B0015OKWKS,"""I think I'm more comfortable with being disappointed. I think I'm angry at you for trying to take that away."" - Emma Thompson

Risk taking was easily accessible in our youth because stocking everything on the table didn't feel like much of a risk. It was affordable too, perhaps because we hadn't yet piled our chips high. But that's what happens as we age. Responsibilities wield in, we succumb to formula, acquire empires, and a risk feels like, well, a risk.

That's where Harvey comes in. While ultimately successful in his once-aspiring career, he's taken his as far as it will go. Fast forward to his daughter Susan's London wedding to a fianc&eacute; whom Harvey's never met and an x-wife with a husband, who's taken his seat as Susan's new go-to father. And then there's Kate, a middle-aged woman working in an international airport, of all ironic places, but has never actually aspired to vigor. Life, it seems, has finally passed them by.

The problem here is two mismatched extremes. Harvey's disappointed with life while Kate is comfortable with disappointment. Last Chance Harvey reminds us that the universe will prod us beyond our stagnant spirit into new daring opportunities, but only to a point. Eventually we have to close our eyes and jump off the high dive. Chance isn't concerned with what follows.

3380924,3,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is going through a mid-life crisis of sorts.  A younger guy's jingle seems to be the favorite at work and his job is in jeopardy.  His daughter seems to be rejecting him in favor of her handsome stepfather, played by James Brolin.  Harvey also seems to have an issue doing anything right.  If there is such a thing as a non-golden touch, Harvey has it.

Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is not having a mid-life crisis, but neither is her life very exciting.  She is resigned to stability, which does not involve a man, or anyone, it seems.  She even finds her mother annoying.  Perhaps it is better to say that she clings to stability.  Kate appears to fear change because she is afraid of being hurt.

These two people meet when Harvey arrives in London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is asking questions for a survey and Harvey is in no mood for answering questions.  The meeting is hardly auspicious.

Harvey attends his daughter's wedding but misses his flight back to the U.S. because of heavy traffic.  Harvey calls his boss, who fires him.  Harvey heads for an airport bar where he sees Kate.  Harvey apologizes to Kate for his earlier behavior, but his real reason for approaching Kate is that he needs someone to listen to him.  Kate, of course, is completely uninterested in listening to Harvey, another rude, nearly obnoxious traveler.

What follows is a nearly formulaic movie as Kate and Harvey do a relationship dance and try to break from their normal routine.  We could almost write the ending along with the obligatory facial tissue and a marginal sniff.

The best thing this movie has going for it is star horsepower.  Emma Thompson has either won or been nominated for more than 80 awards, including two Oscar wins.  Dustin Hoffman has won or been nominated for more than 70 awards, including two Oscar wins.  The supporting cast includes veterans Kathy Baker, James Brolin and many others.  With all the star horsepower, this movie seems as though it would be a sure-fire winner.  Sadly, it is not.

This movie plods.  Harvey's only charming attribute is the face of Dustin Hoffman, which is insufficient to carry the day.  Emma Thompson's Kate is much more charming and I liked her, but romance between Harvey and Kate is just too improbable.  Even if I suspended belief, I still struggle to see these two getting together.  Even if they do get together, the pace of the movie is so slow that I hardly cared.

I must admit that romantic movies are hardly my favorite.  However, I do enjoy a well-plotted love story.  I loved ""The Graduate,"" ""Love Story,"" ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" and dozens more.  This movie is a vague shadow of those movies.

There are few romantic movies about mature adults in the middle years of their lives.  This movie had a lot going for it, especially great actors and an award-winning director.  Unfortunately, the story seemed to be too far outside the director's experience and it falls flat, even with Hoffman and Thompson adlibbing some of the scenes.  I give this one three stars because there is some chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson and I do like a happy ending.  I am disappointed because this movie could have been so much more.

3380929,4,B0015OKWKS,"I enjoyed Last Chance Harvey for a number of reasons.  For one, the main characters are decent and likeable people; sure they've got flaws, and they've fallen into self-defeating habits in life, but part of the beauty of the movie is how they lift themselves out of self-defeat and even at this point in their lives (middle to late middle aged) find love and contentedness with each other.  The characters inspire each other and gently tug each other out of their loneliness and quiet misery.

I liked the tone and pace of the movie too - the gentle humor, the glimpses we get of England, the chemistry between the characters, who aren't ravishingly beautiful or handsome, but have such lovely smiles, warm eyes, and good chemistry with each other.  As Kate Walker and Harvey Shine, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman work well together, and the scenes where they're on camera together have a special light of their own.

The subplot with Kate's mother (and the mysterious, slightly sinister new neighbor) was a bit too silly and thin, but I did enjoy the part of the movie that dealt with Harvey's relationship with his daughter (and I admit there's one part when I was moved to tears, in a moment when he finally stands up and asserts himself as a father - doing this with grace and genuine feeling, and without rancor at his ex-wife or her husband).  I liked this - that you can have a movie without a real villain, only ordinary people messing up and then trying to repair their mistakes and find some love, closeness and peace in life.",1286841600,,1538,4.636029411764706

He is protrayed as somewhat of a bumbler, who manages to screw things up as he goes along, not royally but fairly significantly.  While in London he meets an airline employee, played by Emma Thompson, who seems to be as out of luck as Hoffman.  There is the inevitable chance meet-up but this and other minor cliche plot steps can be dismissed by the overall mood of the film as well as by Hoffman's acting talent.  Hoffman plays the role of Harvey Shine perfectly, helping the viewer feel both the frustrations and triumphs of his life, and mastefully using facial expressions to convey complex emotions.  There is one particular scene that Hoffman performs brilliantly and is one of the more memorable cinematic moments for me in a long time.

The writer of the film (and director) took some big risks with this movie.  He didn't follow the standard plot and time lines.  Instead, he let's the viewer really get to know these people, their character--who they are inside--and let's us follow them around a bit.  And he breaks the rules a second time--he doesn't start off with a bunch of action, or drama--just some simple scenes, showing us the depth of these two people.  Then he breaks the rules yet a third time--he gives these two characters CHARACTER.  They are deep people, of sincerity who have been overlooked in their lives for that very reason.  Much like any of us who just try to live our lives well.  We don't often get acclaim for doing a good job and trying to be responsible.  Then when these two meet--and the chemistry is awesome.  (Really, we first get to see their chemistry in Stranger Than Fiction--which if you haven't seen, then do.  In fact, it appears the writer might have seen them together in THAT film and plopped them down in this one.  Whatever the reasoning for pairing up Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, it WORKS).

3380939,3,B0015OKWKS,"This movie starts off slow and it takes awhile to feel invested in the characters.  However, somewhere towards the middle of the movie, I found myself quietly drawn into caring about them and eagerly wanted to find out what destiny had in store for the two.

Dustin Hoffman stars as Harvey Shine, a seemingly successful jingle composer who has made a good life for himself. However, as the story unfolds, Harvey is quietly depressed, lonely and disappointed with himself that he has never quite measured up in life.  We learn that he is divorced and preparing to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding although he has been alienated from her for some time.  To make matters worse, he is told by his boss that the jingle he is working on for a TV advertisement had better be a home run or else.  Arriving in London, Harvey crosses paths with Emma Thompson's character Kate Walker, a survey taker at Heathrow airport.  In a hurry, Harvey brushes her off and we soon learn that Kate is no stranger to disappointment in her life as well.  Hurt one too many times, Kate would like to meet that special someone but really isn't willing to risk being hurt anymore and instead spends her time reading, hanging out with friends and checking on her mother who lives alone.  Like Harvey, she too is quietly sad, lonely and depressed, facing the reality that she may never know fulfillment.  Both are actually good and capable people but somewhere along the line inertia set in and they let the losses in their lives overwhelm them, living each day with regret rather than seeking their true dreams and desires.

As the movie progresses, Harvey and Kate struggle with more disappointment when their paths cross once again.  It is here where the movie begins to get interesting.  Harvey and Kate do not make an instant love connection.  In fact, they make anything but.  What unfolds is actually a tender and honest portrait of a friendship in the making that may or may not lead to a physically romantic relationship.  It is this developing friendship, this tentative sharing with one another about each's hopes, dreams and yes, losses, that provides the drama for the movie.  Some people may not like this movie because, like Harvey and Kate, it takes some investment to realize its payoff.  The drama that builds is more subtle than earth shattering. But, because of this, the story is much more plausible and as such, the ending much more rewarding and fulfilling than many other romantic comedies/dramas.",1267920000,,2504,4.77262180974478

Rather than finding this movie slow and boring, my wife and I felt compelled to stay up past our bedtime because we simply couldn't fall asleep until it was over.

Yes, the movie moves at a walking pace--that's part of its charm! We should rediscover the skills of paying attention to a real story that does not require the aide of special effects and heart-pounding action.

Kate is attracted to Harvey's simple, humorous chatting-up approach, and he likes her straightforwardness. Over the course of two days, these two ""failures"" form a bond that just may last.

Hoffman and Thompson turn in a pair of subtly nuanced, genuine performances in which each ""becomes"" their character, allowing the audience to forget that they're actors. In keeping with the overall mood of the piece, lighting and backgrounds are consistently muted,  while supporting performances are competent yet ancillary. Last Chance Harvey is a wistful, gentle, and appealing little romance, perfect for spending a quiet evening at home. No bells and whistles here.",1263686400,2,1026,5.212121212121212
3380942,3,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey was a movie that was equal parts uncomfortable and sad as well as uplifting and hopeful. The beginning was very difficult to watch as we are introduced to the main characters via their painfully dull, lonely, and self-defeating lives. Kate is a poll taker in an airport and Harvey is a jingle writer fighting for his job. Single, lonely, and socially inept, these two happen to run into each other through the circumstances of plot and the movie begins to finally pick up.
If fact, the movie seems to bottom out just before it picks up, exactly as the lives of these characters do. I was close to stopping it, I'll be very honest. Watching Dustin Hoffman's Harvey play out his schleppy downtrodden life was cringing. Thompson's Kate is a bit less grating, but either way, the director goes to great lengths to let you know that these are two thoroughly defeated people.
After their second meeting, the two strike up a relationship and therein the movie begins the redemptive part. There was genuine warmth and a sense of hope finally blooming for these two sad people. I felt the ending was tacked on, however, and that the movie could've ended ten or fifteen minutes earlier without the forced tension and syrupy ending, but that's Hollywood.
Last Chance Harvey has some very good observations about marginalized dads in divorce that spoke to me with bitter honesty. Furthermore, there are salient points about remorse over life choices, as well as how easy it seems to retreat to our miserable world for the sheer but sad comfort of it. Using older people was necessary as credulity would've been strained otherwise. I had to believe that these two people had fallen so far below the radar that getting back into life would seem uncomfortable and difficult.

3380945,5,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is a kind man. Although he had dreamed of becoming a jazz pianist, he writes jingles for a living and he has done his job well for many years.  Because of his age, his boss, Marvin, treats him as if he's no longer an asset to the company, suggesting that he stay in London (Harvey's daughter is getting married there) for a while instead of rushing back to work.
Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) works for the Public Statistics Agency in the airport and makes a living taking surveys from any arriving passenger who will allow her to ask the questions. She has a friend who tries to play matchmaker and a mother who craves her attention, phoning her constantly when they are apart.
And Kate's mother Maggie (Eileen Atkins) has her own little storyline. She had an active imagination but I could understand why she thought what she did. This woman amused me.
I felt bad for Harvey and Kate in the beginning because they seemed so alone in the world. Harvey was treated like an outcast at his daughter's wedding and that bothered me. And when his daughter gave him news that hurt him to his heart, I hurt right along with him. I was so glad when he found his voice at the reception. The toast he made brought tears to my eyes. And Kate -it seemed she was just going through the motions of life. When these two people got together I was so happy for them. They were lovable people even though they didn't seem to think so and they were good for each other.

And the pacing is fantastic. It carries you along easily -- not a single scene is too long and not a single moment drags. And the chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson is surprisingly perfect. Goodness. I wish they would make a sequel.

Hoffman's acting is astonishing. I finally ""get"" what he does, and it's astonishing to see because so few actors do it anymore. His character actually listens. Processes. Then reacts. In the real time time of the movie, on the screen. It's the exactness you get from credible ""reality tv."" Seeing people's reactions to what is happening to them, or making decisions, in real time, in the moment. Hoffman is amazing at it.

3380950,4,B0015OKWKS,"My first two thoughts on sitting down to watch this pretty-good film were ""Christ, Dustin Hoffman's getting old!"" And ""Wow, Emma Thompson looks great!"" Hoffman is Harvey Shine, professional New York advertising jingle writer who regrets never having become a jazz pianist. He and his wife split some years ago (he wasn't that great a husband or father, as he admits) and now his daughter is getting married in London. Having flown over to take part, he finds she wants her stepfather to give her away instead. Moreover, his career is falling apart and his boss finally sacks him by cell phone. That's half the set-up. There's also Emma as Kate Walker, self-employed as (apparently) an airport poll-taker with a couple of employees and a neurotic mother, whose social life seems to consist of going on blind dates set up by her friends only to be abandoned by whomever she's with. Harvey, naturally, bumps into Kate both arriving in the country and attempting to depart. But the airline screws up and he's delayed in London for another day, and the two sort of drift together -- largely because Harvey rather desperately insists on trying to establish a relationship. His doggedness about it is wince-provoking; in real life, Kate probably would tell him to sod off. But the funny thing is, in this story, it works. They spend a good deal of time walking and talking, Kate finally drags him to the wedding reception he hadn't meant to attend, and things work out finally with his daughter. It's a matter of Harvey trying to organize what is clearly his ""last chance"" for any kind of happiness and of the never-married Kate trying to decide whether to take the chance of being hurt. It's a nice little different sort of love story with some excellent acting.",1257811200,,1756,4.779605263157895

3380952,5,B0015OKWKS,"I was completely impressed with 'Last Chance Harvey.'  The story just grows on you.

Here you have a man who is on his last legs of his long successful career going to a strange land to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.  He is met with so many obstacles and difficulties where you think he is ready to give up.  Yet, he keeps going, moving ever forward, believing there is something out there.

You also see a wonderful person who is highly involved with her mom who is divorced.  She really never seems to get on with people and has a few hang ups in life where she toils in what is a lonely world for her.

Amazingly, this story is only a weekend long, but you feel a sense of the characters full lives.  One snippet here and one there gives you full view.  This is an amazingly crafted story as well.

You see Harvey Shine (Hoffman) consistently pursue his new interest, Kate Walker (Thompson) after all of his world has seemingly collapse.  It gives you the feeling that maybe that is how he did his work all these years.  Yet, his work and his life are the cause of some of the way things turned out.  You learn about his whole family life in one conversation with his ex played by Kathy Baker, who is married to Jame Brolin, playing the effusive and very much liked step dad.

Yet we are not left without some picture of hope for the lonely.  Life continues there is another day to come and in the end instead of a euphoric ending we get to see that just beginning.

The extra in this video of the reasons behind the film are just excellent.  In fact anyone seeing this immediately after the movie, may look and even be more impressed.  One of the trailers in the DVD is the 'Visitor.'  Frankly, the feeling you get from 'Last Chance Harvey' is pretty much the same.

Movies like these give us hope in the human spirit.  Afterall, we are all human and struggle with our humanity.  A little hope now and then helps.",1255478400,,1927,4.338935574229692
3380953,4,B0015OKWKS,"Last Chance Harvey opens with Harvey Shine (Hoffman), an over-the-hill jingle writer who's about to lose his job. He's flying to London to his daughter Susan's wedding, but promises to return on time for a key meeting with a client. In London, Harvey quickly finds himself alone in a hotel while the rest of the family and guests, his estranged wife and her new husband included, rent a house in the city. He is awkward in his interactions with others, even Susan, making blunders at every turn and creating even more awkward silences. Harvey eventually works up the courage to tell Susan he will not be attending her reception in favor of flying back for the meeting, and Susan reveals that she asked her step-father to give her away at the wedding instead.

Londoner Kate (played by Emma Thompson)is an airport employee, surveying people as they de-plane. She is quite close to being called an ""old maid"", and her friends set her up on uncomfortable blind dates with guys who have little interest in her. Kate's and Harvey's paths intersect in an airport bar. Harvey misses his flight and finds out that he's been fired after all; he drowns his sorrows in shots next to Kate's who's reading with a glass of wine.

Harvey chats her up and they wind up spending the day together; Kate eventually convinces Harvey to attend Susan's reception, which she attends with him. Not surprisingly, Kate becomes Harvey's ""last chance"" at love and companionship, and their quirks somehow mesh together. Alone they are awkward and uncomfortable, but together they blossom.

I watched the trailer for Last Chance Harvey prior to seeing the movie, and the trailer summed it all up - there were no surprises in the movie itself. Last Chance Harvey presents a nice and heartfelt story, great acting and a lot of charm. I think the movie's crowning glory was Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Harvey Shine, and the awkwardness he exuded on screen (unless of course he is that awkward in real life, which I wouldn't know). At times, I almost squirmed at Harvey's actions - refusing to shake hands, fumbling over toasts, walking into things, etc.

Last Chance Harvey was a good movie with a nice storyline, but there was nothing too memorable or worth discussing with others; it was just a way to pass the time.",1254441600,,2287,4.782278481012658

What makes the film fresh is that the still act like how you would have imagined them acting in their 20s and 30s - willing to put themselves out there for love.

But where the film starts to fall apart is with the supporting characters - all of which seem like a waste of time.  They have cute one-liners and sometimes achieve likability - but they take away from the story at hand - and it feels like they are stealing screentime from what we really want to watch.

Love among ""senior types"" can really have more possibilities than the young love idiot stories. I was reminded of ""Separate Tables"" (1958) but with laffs and renewal and lots of unexpected charm. Golden Globe nominees for comedy, Hoffman and Emma didn't really play anything for a laff. The natural idiocy of the human condition were well understood by the players.

3380957,3,B0015OKWKS,"This is a 2 disc set (1 widescreen and 1 full-frame format).  Extras are: the making of, an audio commentary, and the theatrical trailer.  This 93 minute movie is rated PG-13 and stars Dustin Hoffman (Harvey Shine) and Emma Thompson (Kate).  James Brolin plays a fairly brief part as the Step-Father (Brian) of Harvey's daughter (Susan Shine) and husband of Harvey's ex-wife (Jean).  The story line is about 2 people who are not having any luck with relationships, but they find out it is never too late to meet a mate, while Susan Shine is preparing to and marrying her love, Scott.

Harvey is a pianist who writes jingles and background music for commercials and he's not exactly burning the notes off the pages.  He is seriously close to losing his job.  Harvey lives in the US and daughter Susan lives in London with Jean and Brian, so Harvey must go to London for the wedding.  He does not exactly feel very welcomed when he arrives and finds out that Jean rented a house for everyone else and a hotel room for him and he doesn't exactly jive with the others either when he arrives at the rehearsal dinner. He decides he will just stay for the wedding and skip the reception.  As he tells Susan, she explains that she has asked Brian to give her away (Ouch!).

Meanwhile, Kate is a survey-taker at the airport.  She actually meets Harvey when he first gets off the plane but he tells her he is in a hurry and runs off.  Kate has a mother who believes her neighbor is weird and thinks he has a body in the shed.  Momma calls Kate constantly on the cell phone to complain about the neighbor.  Kate has no social life so her co-worker tries to set her up with a blind date.  That bums out when the guy's friends show up at the pub and Kate does not seem to fit in.  After the wedding, Harvey goes to the airport only to find out he cannot fly out until the next day.  In an airport pub, he actually meets Kate and they hit it off.

The movie is good, but nothing outstanding-nothing earth-shattering.  It is just fine performances by 2 fine actors.  No action--it is a love story about 2 good people who stumble upon a relationship with each other.  It is a movie for the hopeful romantic.  Things might not be what you want right now, but they can change overnight, and will never be the same again.

There is also a hidden message in the story.  When things aren't working and you act differently (as Harvey did later in the day), people relate to you differently.  In other words, you may need to change the way you interact with people if you are hoping for different results.",1252886400,,2582,4.3852631578947365
3380958,3,B0015OKWKS,"I really wanted to like ""Last Chance Harvey.""  This is because I like romantic comedies where the leads are something closer to real people than the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  So a movie that has Dustin Hoffman (who I felt was incredible in ""the Graduate"" and ""Rain Man"") and Emma Thompson (who I've loved watching in many films) should have been something I liked.

But for some reason I didn't like it.  Why is that?

<spoilers>

I think the answer to that question is twofold.  First, the plot seemed to be a bit of reach.  I could believe that two people who were ""lost souls"" might hit it off like Hoffman and Thompson's character did.  I just think that they would have needed more time to do so than just walking around for a day.  If I had been reading the script for ""Last Chance Harvey"" in advance of it being made into a film, I would have asked the producers, ""Can't the writer come up with a way to throw the two characters together for a couple of days at least?""

That's what happened in the movie ""the Holiday,"" another romantic comedy that had two women (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet) fall rapidly in love with two men (Jude Law and Jack Black).  In the case of that movie, however, the timeline was two weeks.  While the idea people would really, REALLY get to know each other in that time was a bit of a stretch, it was a lot more believable than ""Last Chance Harvey"" and its much shorter timeline.

The other problem with the plot was its failure to explain why everyone in the movie apart from Emma Thompson was so mean to Dustin Hoffman's character.  Take the case of Hoffman's character's daughter.  She and he had apparently grown apart since he got divorced from her mom.  She had grown closer to her stepdad.  So she decided she wanted him to give her away at the altar.  I could see someone deciding to do that.  I really could.  But for the life of me, I don't see how the daughter would have waited until her (real) father had flown all the way over to London to attend the wedding and sprung that rather nasty surprise on him the day before.  With no explanation, doing that just seemed cruel.

So I was disappointed by this movie, but I know a lot of people liked it.  So some time in the future, I may take another crack at it...which is why I gave it three stars and not the one or two I really felt it deserved.",1252108800,,2359,4.297052154195011

I liked the fact that this was a love story about an older couple.  Love stories about young people are a dime a dozen and it's nice to remember that falling in love has no age limit.

3380966,3,B0015OKWKS,"Boy meets girl. Boy woos girl. Girl and boy have misunderstanding, but iron it out.

Well, imagine that scenario for the fiftysomething set. ""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those thoroughly mediocre little movies that only manages to make itself memorable because it happens to star great actors. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson manage to turn this middle-of-the-road romantic comedy into something worth watching on a lazy summer afternoon, as long as you don't expect much plot.

The titular character (Hoffman, natch) is a down-on-his-luck musician/jingle-writer who visits England for his daughter's wedding, but fate seems determined to make him miserable -- women ignore him, his daughter has dropped him in favor of her stepfather, and he's humiliated at the rehearsal dinner. The only person who hasn't caused poor Harvey to drop further is pretty Kate Walker (Thompson), an interviewer whom Harvey brushes off at the airport.

Unsurprisingly, when they actually spend some time together, Kate and Harvey begin to click and Harvey starts openly pursuing this new woman who actually treats him like a human being. His self-confidence and charm begin to grow as Kate begins to reciprocate his feelings -- but when they hit a sudden snag in their first date, Harvey may have lost his last chance.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those plots that has been around for eons, especially in movies: lonely single people reluctantly find love with each other, despite a few ""Love Affair"" obstacles and misunderstandings, and turn their miserable pathetic lives around. It's neither a really good movie nor a bad one -- just sort of average, especially since the climactic obstacle turns out to be a really contrived, rather overwrought misunderstanding. Bleah.

But it does have a certain amount of charm, once Joel Hopkins has finished heaping every kind of indignity imaginable on Harvey without resorting to slapstick (seriously, give the guy a break!). There's  a certain sweetness to seeing some perpetually disappointed people suddenly blossoming in utterly ordinary ways -- shopping, conversing, and getting awkwardly to know each other. And some of the gentle humor is amusing as well -- such as Kate's mother being convinced that her neighbor is a serial killer.

Honestly, this movie would be forgettable if it weren't for Hoffman and Thompson, both of whom are sublimely awkward, sweet and touching. Hoffman seems like a quietly enduring presence that is constantly beaten down by the world, but never gives in; and though it's not terribly convincing that someone who looks like Emma Thompson would be a lonely spinster, she is definitely Hoffman's match and (though no clear answers are given) obviously the person who belongs with him.

And thankfully there are no cheap ploys for audience sympathy, just a pair of strong presences that fill the entire movie. The supporting actors also do a good job -- nobody is demonized even if they do Harvey wrong -- but they're overshadowed by the two leads.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is one of those ""nice"" little movies that are pleasant but unexceptional in any way, except for the lead actors. A good lazy afternoon movie, but not one that will stick in your mind.",1248307200,,3217,5.100760456273764
3380967,5,B0015OKWKS,"This movie has received a lot of negative or neutral reviews, but I absolutely loved and adored this movie! It is the story of two lonely misfits, Dustin Hoffman as Harvey Shine and Emma Thompson as Kate Walker who find each other in London.

Harvey is a frustrated jingle writer who wants to be a jazz pianist and Kate works at Heathrow Airport as a surveyer/greeter and she wants to write. They meet at a time when life is kind of low for each of them. Harvey is coming to London for his daughter's wedding. And the daughter has chosen her stepfather to give her away. He is about to be fired from his job as a jingle writer--making way for new and younger talent. Kate is in dead end, thankless job and she has to deal with her very dependent mother.

This is a romantic comedy and is predictable, but the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson are superb. You find yourself cheering for these two adults as they take baby steps in finally growing up. They have a wonderful chemistry between them. It isn't the mad passion of a younger person, but rather the burgeoning love and respect of two mature adults.

The movie moves along at a slower pace than many are used to, but it is full of nuances and subtly which makes the story all the more satisfying.",1248048000,,1268,4.410256410256411
3380968,2,B0015OKWKS,"I watched this movie because I like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson very much. With these two powerhouse actors, with the quality of story the directors and producers had to work with, I cannot believe they ended up with such a substandard product. Shame on all of them! The story is about two lonely, older people who have not achieved their dreams, meet inexplicably at an airport bar and in real-world time, managed to strike up a relationship, go shopping for clothing suitable for a wedding, and then make it TO the wedding in about what I calculated had to be no more than two hours. I am one who can stretch my imagination almost to the tipping point, but this movie also expected us to believe that the character played by Hoffman changed from a frumpy, down-in-the-dumps loser into an upbeat, talented, somewhat engaging personality, while sitting at that airport bar, after spying Ms. Thompson's character alone at a table, reading a book.

After being subjected to abject humiliation by Hoffman's daughter's kind of ridiculous decision to have her step father walk her down the aisle, which is another critique I could go into altogether, I tipped over that edge and slipped down that cliff when Hoffman and Thompson show up (two hours later, mind you) at the reception, and somehow, Hoffman manages to overcome all of his miseries and unfair experiences at this wedding and give what, I think was supposed to be, a tear-jerking toast to his undeserving daughter and new husband.

All I can say is, if Hoffman and Thompson were NOT in this movie, I wouldn't be writing this review. This one would have gone where all the other bad movies go to die. Two stars for two great actors. No stars for the director, producer, studio execs, etc. who abused them.",1247443200,4,1765,4.745928338762215
3380970,4,B0015OKWKS,"First, this is not a comedy. It's also not so much a romance as it is belated coming of age story for a pair of potentially romantic characters.
It's marketed as such so don't hold that against the film or its cast.

Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson do a good turn here with performances that feel real, desperate, moving but not cloyingly winsome.
Harvey, played very well by Hoffman, is a man at the end of his disappointing career. He had some fun with writing and performing in the jingles for commercials, but he's a musician at heart who has never felt like he was doing what he truly loved. It paid the bills.
Emma is another victim of the world moving too fast to keep up. Hoping for a chance at romance she seems to always be in the wrong place and in marginal situations. Her ability to actually breakdown as she privately stifles tears is heart rending. Worse, she's a character with a personal guard so fixed into position that she'd immediately avoid a good hug, knowing a futile, even if sincere gesture when she sees one.
While Hoffman's Harvey is being unmanned by his own daughter on the night before her wedding in an alienating setting, Thompson's Kate is watching her blind date unravel when opportunistic friends of her ""date"" drop in on him while she's in the loo, making her the odd person out. On top of that she has a paranoid mother calling her cell at the most inopportune moments. Kate attempts this juggling act as a loving daughter trying very hard not to dismiss her mother, taking the time to encourage her mother, but also to have a life of her own.
Of course, these two meet. Eventually Harvey's jovial nature and puppy dog charm starts to win her over. Still, there's a palpable distance and they are strangers. It takes her letting her guard down and Harvey risking her utter alienation to get them on an even footing. The charm of this film is not in just the characters or the story. The setting of London as a backdrop, with all it's diverse and multi-ethnic charm and old world quality makes this the perfect place for such a budding relationship to get started. Both, in their own way, are pretty much at odds with their world but also lost within it. This allows them both an opportunity they otherwise would not have taken.
I love the quiet dignity of this film set in a teaming city. It has unexpected humor and subdued charm as these two character find not only themselves, but do it through each other.
It ends in hope, not in finality. In todays confusing world with it's ever shifting priorities even a toe hold in something real is enough to make a person glow with hope.",1247356800,,2620,4.504201680672269
3380971,5,B0015OKWKS,"More than a bit like Before Sunrise for the mature adult set, this film is charming and poignant.  Excellent performances abound from the cast.  If anything, this is a movie about hope.  Life can twist and turn in delightful ways if you don't give up, and if you look for opportunities right for you.  Lately, romantic comedies and dramas seem to have become extremely cliched and banal.  While this film is rather formulaic, it strays from type in that the two lead characters are older, and also that the romance is almost a subplot to Harvey finding a way back to a purposeful life again.  It doesn't hurt, that as a 30-something woman, I found Dustin Hoffman to be quite good-looking as Harvey, he's aged well.  I also admire Emma Thompson in almost anything she is in.  This would be a good choice for an older couple looking for a romantic movie to share together or for a girls night movie.

3380974,4,B0015OKWKS,"OK, I'm getting older.  I admit it.  But come on, Dustin Hoffman in a romantic comedy?  Now? With the great English actress, Emma Thompson... She'll tower over him.  Who thought this up?  It's got to be quirky or artsy-fartsy, and he's simply going to whine on my nerves.

Storyline: a divorced, music ad/'jingle toons' composer heads off to England to attend his estranged daughter's wedding.  His job's going down the tubes, he's lonely, depressed, jetlagged, and his ex-wife and her super, perfect husband(of course James Brolin, really towering over Dustin) are there for the bride.  He's tired and grumpy and sarcastic and out of place and apparently miscast.

He blows off Emma's character who's taking surveys at the airport but later runs across her at an empty pub.  Her desolate life with frequent check on you calls from mom, the ever ubiquitous, ever solid British actress Eileen Atkins(super in ""Crawford"") plays back and forth in comparison with Harvey's life until they discover each other.

For a day or so, they're not alone anymore but are two very human, real  people, not caricatures.  In the 'making of' section, both actors relate how they wanted to be more like themselves and more natural.  Neither all neurotic or goofy, but intelligent and complex.  There's a few silly moments, but by in large, they mute the humor and the sentimentality balancing off each other.  And there are no bad people in the story just poor first impressions and life decisions.

All the actors are good.  His daughter played by Canadian actress Liana Balaban is perfect showing her longstanding hurt and disappointment with her neglectful Dad but still wanting (or hoping she'll want) him there.

This flick won't appeal much for the youngsters(less than 40?)unless they want to see a mature, romantic comedy without much language, no sex, no special effects, some predictability and with the wonderful English background and the superb craft of these two amazing actors.",1246492800,,1974,5.055727554179566

Those of us who are older, who have been there, who've experienced long-term lonely, will not notice the beginning of the movie as being boring and slow, but instead a reflection of how life can become tedious and difficult to adults without a mate. They fall to trying to find rewards in jobs, senior parents, adult kids, books, etc. & of course fail. It's just not the same. Youth seldom ""get it"". It takes a couple to decades, midlife crisis age, and commonplace failings to be able to see the story behind the story.  Those people will ""get it.""

The second half of the movie is brilliantly played by Thompson and Hoffman, strangers who meet in London by accident, who suddenly recognize a possibility of love, a second chance, a moment of winning, a time of relationship that might...just might...be extended long-term. This is a full-length movie version of REALITY TV but done so much better.

For those who just might be too young for this type of film...I strongly suggest that first you watch the Special Feature ""An Unconventional Love Story: The making of Last Chance Harvey"" prior to watching the feature. That will help young adults who have not yet experienced decades of life's failures, to grasp the significance of the subtleties in the acting, the interaction between the stars, and this entertaining but realistic love story.

3380991,3,B0015OKWKS,"There was a moment during ""Last Chance Harvey"" when my heart sank. The first two-thirds or so of the movie present a dual character study, beautifully acted by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, of two people I couldn't help but like who stumble into each other's lives. Each with their charms and their baggage, the progress of their relationship could not be predicted, but offered a subject for hope.

Then it happened. Apparently the producers insisted on lobotomies for the writers as a condition of continued employment.

The pair agree to meet ""tomorrow at noon."" Just in case you missed it, one character makes the other repeat this, twice. These are sophisticated, mature adults in the twenty-first century. They both have cell phones (we know this because they're constantly being interrupted). Why do they never bother to exchange phone numbers?

No points for guessing the next plot twist. :-(

Having set up this entirely contrived dramatic tension, ""Last Chance Harvey"" proceeds to resolve it and treat that as a resolution of the film... totally abandoning the worthwhile story that could have been built from the drama inherent in the characters themselves. We get no answers to the interesting questions, just the rather dull completion of a plot clich&eacute; that should have been put to rest two decades ago.

Five stars for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, four and a half for the first two-thirds of the movie, and one and a half for the brain-dead conclusion.",1245456000,,1482,5.008130081300813
3380992,1,B0015OKWKS,"I liked the idea of a romance between two mature individuals. It's a nice switch from the, in their twenties type romantic movies. Yet this film had nothing to offer. For fifty minutes, the film detailed, what seemed like every minute of two individuals with excessively empty lives. It was as if they had never experienced anything. During that time they moped around, woke up, worked and answered their cell phones.

There must have been fifteen minutes dedicated to watching the mother look out of the window. Another fifteen wasted watching the leading characters answer their cell phones.

The dialog was poor, from beginning to end.  The real issue is that nothing happened.  Absolutely nothing.  I could film my life or my friends and have the same result.  Except I believe it maybe less boring.

I just finished watching the movie about ten minutes ago, and already I cannot remember the name of the woman, (played by Emma Thompson), in the film. If the movie title did not have the name of the male character, Harvey, I may have forgotten his name as well.

The main downfall of this movie is that it moved at a snail's pace. There were feeble attempts at evoking empathy, but none worked. Bottom line, I do not recommend this film. If possible I would give it zero stars.

The film seems to be slapped together on every level and has just enough spunk to drag me through it once but not enough for a second viewing. Great films can be watched throughout ones lifetime. It's why I can still watch Hoffam in Midnight Cowboy, The Graduate, Kramer VS Kramer and Tootsie, but I will never watch this again.

The writing almost seemed as if it was slapped together in some board room by a bunch of executives playing with some industry ""build a movie"" handbook. It was very predictable. Spoilers. Hoffman gets a heart jiggle just when he has to meet Thompson. Come on... And the wooden X, the transparent daughter, the robotic new step daddy. I cringed at certain points.

3380994,5,B0015OKWKS,"...Fortunately I didn't have to.  These two brilliant actors star in Last Chance Harvey, a delightfully adult drama.  I was describing the film to a friend recently, and I told him, ""It's not a comedy, really, but it's funny like real life.""  And that sort of sums this film up for me.  It's far more like real life than you usually see on the big screen.

The story is a character study of two very real people.  Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a 60-something jingle writer who always wanted to be a jazz pianist, but was never good enough.  He may have seen some success in the past, but his career is waning.  His marriage ended long ago, and it's clear he's not close to his daughter.  Nonetheless, he's flying to London for her wedding.  There Harvey encounters Kate Walker (Thompson) a lonely, 40-something woman who spends entirely too much time on the phone with her elderly mother.  She has close friendships and enriches her life with books and writing classes, but none of that makes up for what's missing.  An unlikely couple, when Kate and Harvey come together, they're greater than the sum of their parts.

And in the hands of Hoffman and Thompson, these characters couldn't be more believable, sympathetic, or true to life.  I defy you to watch the wedding toast without tearing up.  Last Chance Harvey isn't a big or flashy film, but it's smart and entertaining.  It's also given a nice DVD presentation, with a 16:30 making of featurette, and an above average commentary featuring writer/director Joel Hopkins, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman.  So often actor commentaries can be vacuous, but in the hands of these masters there were real insights into character and craft.

I can't help but wonder what this movie could have been in the hands of another, more dynamic director.

3380997,5,B0015OKWKS,"I must confess I am not biggest fan of romantic comedies in the realm of cinema.  This is mainly due to the fact that in the past ten years (I feel) that romantic comedies all follow the same stereotypical formula:

- Young guy meets young girl.
- Both guy & girl are very superficial (to some degree).
- Both guy & girl are very materialistic (to some degree).
- Both guy & girl cannot act.
- The comedy is grossly pratfalls & physical jesting.
- In addition the comedy is crude humor limited by a PG-13 rating.
- With 15 to 20 minutes left in the movie there is an arbitrary ""conflict"".
- The conflict is resolved in an unbelievable and/or empathizing manner.
- Guy and girl reconcile but still retain their superficial/materialistic ethos.

I am happy to say that ""Last Chance Harvey"" is none of the above.  It was a movie unlike any I have seen in a long time. Dare I say a neo-vintage romance film?

Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) is traveling to London in order to attend his only daughter's wedding.  It appears that over the years Harvey has become the outcast of the family.  This is evident by his daughter's request to have her step-father give her away rather than having her real father, Harvey, to perform this duty.  To add insult to injury, Harvey has also lost his job as a composer for music used in TV ads.

Meanwhile Kate (Emma Thompson) is a resident of London and works in an airport.  Kate also is living the single life, but is semi-hopeful she might meet somebody.  In addition, her mother is constantly irking Kate about myriad things.  These things are but not limited to Kate's love life and a supposed ""serial killer"" living next door.  Needless to say Kate has become tired of the humdrum routine.

It isn't any big shock to figure out what happens next, when Harvey meets Kate.  I sort of knew this going into the movie, so it didn't bother me.  What makes this movie magically is the chemistry between Thompson and Hoffman.  This chemistry is what makes the inevitable so enduring.  Another thing interesting about this movie is it isn't a ""romantic comedy"".  Rather it is just a throwback to those romantic films of the 1950/60s.  This movie has some funny moments, but by no means is comedy.  Also it is really refreshing to see a movie about love and relationships that doesn't focus on model-esque twenty something guys and gals.

The DVD comes with both a widescreen and full screen version of the movie.  I watched the former and I am glad I did.  ""Last Chance Harvey"" shows amazing cinematography of London, as well as some interesting camera angles.  I feel these would be lost in the full screen version of the film.  Which is funny because I normally wouldn't think this is a movie that needs to be viewed in letterbox.  There are also some trailers/previews on the DVD, as well as a featurette about the making of the movie.

If you are in the mood for romance that is subtle, bitter-sweet, enchanting and human, than ""Last Chance Harvey"" is the movie for you.  My first response to watching this movie was that it wouldn't be any good.  I am so glad I viewed this film because it allowed me to be charmed for 90 minutes, and that hasn't happened in a long time.",1245024000,2,3198,4.511304347826087
3380998,4,B0015OKWKS,"Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, lonely composer of jingles for TV commercials.  His daughter is getting married and bride and groom have settled for the ceremony in London.  Emma Thompson plays a middle aged woman with a dreadful job and controlling mother.  She is lonely too but seems to be used to being disappointed in people, particularly her blind dates.

During wedding rehearsal, it is apparent to Harvey that he is completely separated from his family.  His daughter announces that she will be given away by her stepfather.  Harvey and his ex-wife are estranged and she lets him know that he is paty of one during his daughter's most important moment in her life.  In the meantime, Harvey's boss decides to have him fired.

As series of coincidences progress, these two lonely people connect in a matter of days.  It becomes apparent to both of them that regardless of how little they know each other, the fact that they come from two different generations and disparate continents, they owe to each other a last chance in getting some happiness out of life.",1244937600,,1070,4.835164835164835
3380999,3,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a rare example of a modern Hollywood romantic comedy featuring a mature couple meeting and falling in love.  The leads, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, are top tier performers who put a lot of heart into their work.  Neither of them seem to be overly challenged with the material in this film, but romantic comedies are by nature lightweight and predictable.  Although this movie delivers on the formula, ultimately the romance angle didn't work for me.

Harvey Shine (Hoffman) is a New York advertising executive and jingle writer who hops a plane to London to attend his daughter's wedding.  In London he finds himself marginalized in all the wedding plans; his daughter even informs him that she has decided to ask her stepfather to give her away.  He misses his flight home.  He is fired from his job over the phone.  Following that perfect storm of a bad day he decides to slam down a few Jack Daniels in the airport lounge and this is when he meets Kate Walker (Thompson).

What I liked most about this movie were the performances.  Thompson shows no fear of being ""dowdied up"" for her role as a middle aged, middle class spinster in a dead end job.  She is a few pounds heavier than we're used to seeing, wears polyester and a ponytail scrunchie, and allows herself to be photographed from various unflattering angles.  Even with all this, it's impossible to disguise that this is a beautiful woman with a good nature and a generous heart. She's irresistible.

Hoffman, on the other hand, may have been too good at fleshing out Harvey.  At times he comes across as a desperate stalker, forcing his company on this polite lady, following her onto her commuter train, and waiting for her outside her classroom.  She really doesn't know much about this guy when she agrees to accompany him to the wedding reception.  What we see (and why doesn't Kate?) is that this guy is not well liked by those family and friends who know him best; he rudely abandons Kate at the kid's table while he dances with a variety of partners and only resumes his efforts with Kate after she has quietly gotten up to leave.

While I'd love to be able to recommend ""Last Chance Harvey"" without reservations, I found it impossible to suspend disbelief enough to imagine it working out for these two.  During the course of this movie the couple has an acquaintance of less than 24 hours.  Kate has been on the receiving end of Harvey's rude behavior more than once, but that doesn't seem to matter.  We should be grateful that Hollywood didn't go the usual route of casting a 20-something actress as Kate, but I found the age gap of 20+ years quite significant when the younger partner is pushing 50.  (Thompson was 49 and Hoffman 70; she mentions in the commentary that she's playing around 44 and he's playing around 65. Oh, well...THAT makes it better.)  To further complicate matters, she has a dead end job; he's unemployed.  She lives in London; he lives in White Plains, NY. The list goes on.  Part of what makes falling in love at 50 different from falling in love at 20 is that people have learned something more about life. Kate and Harvey are too old to throw caution to the wind like teenagers, but too young for their dotage.

Oddly, the DVD package includes two disks.  The basic difference appears to be that one has the film in wide screen presentation and additional special features; The other disk offers the film in full screen presentation.  The break down is like this:

Disc 1: Feature in Wide screen Presentation; Setup: Audio - Dolby Surround 5.1, Audio Commentary with writer/director Joel Hopkins, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Subtitles in English for the deaf and hearing impaired, or Spanish; Scene Selections; Special Features: Featurette - An Unconventional Love Story, the Making of Last Chance Harvey, Theatrical Trailer, ""Also on DVD"" previews for other films.

Disc 2: Feature in Full Screen Presentation, Subtitles, Scene Selections, ""Also on DVD"" trailers for other films.

Suitable for most family viewing between the ages of 9 to 90.  The film contains a small amount of mild swearing, no violence or sex.",1244937600,,4155,4.751743375174337
3381010,4,B0015OKWKS,"There is an early scene which sets the story for me. It is when Harvey (Dustin Hoffman), a commercial jingle writer, is in flight to London to attend his daughter's wedding. Harvey has tried to converse with his seat neighbor who cooly rebuffs him. A lone cone of light from overhead shines down on Harvey in the dark airplane cabin, as he is surrounded by sleeping passengers. Here we are introduced to a lonely man, who never seems to fit in with the crowd, who is unable to say the right things at social gatherings, who drinks a little too much. He confesses at one point in the story that he has always felt his own family was embarrassed of him. We see this as he sits in his hotel room alone in London, as he tries to connect especially with his ex-wife and daughter at the reception.

His last chance comes as he is arriving at the Heathrow terminal and is approached by Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) an airline agent who conducts passenger surveys. Kate is single, sort of stuck at a place in life with a nervous clinging mother, and  who no longer fits in with the younger single scene. Harvey bumps into Kate again when he decides to fly back to New York before the wedding after he learns that his daughter has asked her step father to give her away at the altar. Harvey casts out the line one last time in the airport bar when he tries to engage Kate in conversation over lunch.

Some film viewers have remarked how unlikely it would ever be for these two people to be paired together. However it is possible, and that is what makes it a delightful love story, especially for those of us who feel by passed by life. It would be a 5 star movie for this romantic, however some of the ""side bar"" stories in the film merely water down the blossoming of the relationship between Harvey and Kate.",1244937600,,1801,4.370149253731343
3381011,5,B0015OKWKS,"At the beginning of this movie, I was wondering if it would become more enjoyable to watch.  The story initially dealt with two individuals played by Hoffman and Thompson who were each separately immersed in deep sadness.

Harvey (Hoffman) struggles with personal emptiness, yet still makes the effort to fly to London to attend his daughter's wedding. From the start, he is the Odd-Man Out, displaced from his daughter's life by his former wife and her new husband. Hapless, glum, and alone, Harvey finds himself in an unexpected circumstance.

The lady Kate, (Emma Thompson), has her own demons. She, too, rarely smiles. Her world includes a housebound mother who suspects her neighbor of sinister wrongdoing and a cell phone that keeps ringing. Her attempts to inject fun and socializing into her life aren't quite working out.  Overall, it seems, she is quite lonely and she rarely smiles.

By chance, these two individuals meet. Their short walk keeps getting longer as they discover they have a lot to talk about.  Harvey and Kate smile and laugh together more and more. The humor of the film is subtle and pleasant.

The ultimate destination of their paths is predictable. However, it is uplifting and joyful to see Harvey and Kate come into their own and at the same time, come together.

I happened to watch this with someone who saw it in the case, said dismissively, ""looks like a Chick-Flick"".  He frequently falls asleep in movies or walks out.  Very discriminating-a film has to be good!
Well, he watched this film in its entirety and enjoyed it a lot.

Last Chance Harvey is a surprising sleeper of a film.  All viewers were riveted to the screen as Hoffman and Thompson are clearly superb performers.

This is a lovely film; cinematography is excellent.  Do watch the widescreen version-the scenery in London is beautiful and adds to the viewer's enjoyment. The use of color and lighting is also well done.

I honestly didn't expect to like this as much as I did as many reviews have been lackluster. See for yourself- there are many things to like here.",1244937600,,2070,4.824362606232294

It wasn't a complete train wreck, but not my favorite Emma Thompson movie.",1244592000,,399,4.882352941176471
3381013,4,B0015OKWKS,"THE MOVIE:

I give the movie 3.5 stars.  It was a good movie -- certainly well-acted, and presented with an appropriate amount of emotion.  It's about second-chances (or as the title indicates, last chances), and it's a love story about grown-up people.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The special features earn 5 stars.

The featurette about the making of the film is short -- 16 minutes, but in it you learn that the film was written for Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.

The commentary on the film is done by the director, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman.  It's a don't-miss feature of the disc!  I enjoy watching movies with the commentary track, but I rarely get all the way through, unless the commentary is done by people I really like, or if it's an all-time favorite movie.  Oftentimes those involved get carried away and don't add much of interest.

Dustin Hoffman shares candidly about relating to his character -- in regards to his own divorce (he also shares some memories about Kramer vs. Kramer).

In this commentary, we hear Emma Thompson's thoughts on ""the acting process,"" the super-skinny Hollywood actress phenomenon.

Sounds like me for oh so many years.  I had the feeling that the writers had a basic plot and scheme; however, they did not realize that they had less than 30 minutes of presentation.  With that they had to expand scenes with all the typical car rides or chases, innate walking or talking and just time filling scenes.  At the end the producer said, whew I can't believe we finally made the 93 minutes.  (My words; not his.)

Unlike many of today's movies this one at least had some events that actually touched the common souls of man.  He was a procrastinator of the first order but did not know how to manage his inabilities.  It cost him.  He permitted his family and friends to use him for a door mat.  It cost him.  The moment he found himself in another hotel far away from the action is the moment he should have packed his bag and gave the party a ""adios my friends"" or ""family"" and took to the sky.  In spite of some pretty decent acting, her part was only as a whim and space filling.

""Last Chance Harvey"" tells the story of an American jingle writer (Hoffman), and a British woman (Thompson), who meet each other in London. They don't have much of a Meet Cute, which is appreciated.

We see them as they have their first awkward conversation and gradually grow more comfortable around each other moving towards the inevitable conclusions.

There's a certain sweetness here. The relationship reminds me, of all things, of the relationship between Admiral Adama and President Roslin on ""Battlestar Galactica"". Two people, of a certain age, who find each other, despense with all the adolscent sloppiness normally found in movies, and make a life together.

There's also some real chuckles, though not any loud laughs. It's also quite wonderful to see the performances from Thompson and Hoffman, both of whom are just getting better at their craft as they get older. They have a great chemistry and there's a nice easiness between them that one seldom sees on screen.

Overall, I'd recommend this movie. It's nice, it's sweet, it's short and enjoyable.",1244073600,,1325,5.004545454545455

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with it. The story besides being predictable, moves too slow. The story never picked up momentum and I could not wait for the movie to be over.

3381032,4,B0015OKWKS,"I expected the comedic romance that numbs the brain.  I much more preferred what I found here.  It's part character study, part awkward exchanges, and what it's like ""out there"" when you aren't young any more.

Harvey Shine is in a job he slightly hates writing commercial jingles, Kate Walker has been tossed so often in love that her mother has made it her mission to constantly call and remind Kate about her lack luster love life and keep her company.  Harvey is on his way to England to see his daughter get married (long way to go to see two American kids get married).  His relationship with his daughter is strained and Harvey later admits he thinks he embarasses his daughter.  Harvey's daughter has choosen her step dad to play the traditional ""Dad"" role at the wedding.  And Harvey is crushed and leaves the wedding right after she's married.

It's in the airport bar while drowning his bad day he says Kate.  They exchange some banter and seem to have a similar outlook and humor.  It's awkward, the love story is awkward, even the humor is awkward and I think that is why I found it to be so charming.

I'm sure if you thought hard enough you know a Harvey and/or a Kate.  The acting is superb, the direction is mature and to the point.  You won't, most likely, be swept away with the most moving love story of the ages, but if you find the heart of the movie you might just enjoy it and find yourself charmed.

3381034,5,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is the type of film that makes you stand back and re-evaluate your life.  ""Am I truly happy?""  ""If not, what can I do to make myself happy?""  ""Is it too late for me to have another chance at happiness?""  ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a bittersweet romantic drama where two mismatched people fall in love and discover that it's never too late to find happiness in life.

  Dustin Hoffman (""Rain Man"") gives a radiant performance as Harvey Shine who use to be a lot of fun according to his ex-wife.  Now he is an aging, workaholic musician who has one last chance to sell an advertisement jingle or else it's the unemployment line for him.  He travels to London to attend the wedding of his daughter Susan whom he neglected as a child.  Soon after landing, he learns that he's lost his job, Susan wants her stepfather to give her away at the wedding, and he has just missed his last flight back to the states.  As he reflects on his ruined life, he encounters the reserved Kate Walker (adorably played by Emma Thompson of ""Remains of the Day""); she is a government statistician working at the Heathrow Airport.  Kate would rather be alone, and constantly harangued by her bored mom, than risk the heartache of dating.  Somehow, the two lonesome birds develop a friendship that blossoms into trust and love.

  ""Last Chance Harvey"" taught me that we all make mistakes that we live to regret later on in life.  Fortunately, there is forgiveness.  We must forgive ourselves and move on.  If we don't give ourselves another chance, no one else will.  Whether you are young, middle aged or living in your twilight years, you deserve a second chance and a third chance and so on until you find true love.  And ""Last Chance Harvey"" is filled with love.  The love shared by daughter and mother, the love shared by two newlyweds, and the love shared by friends who only want the best for each other.

  I've always heard that the weather is gloomy in London.  Not so in ""Last Chance Harvey.""  The sun always shined on beautiful London locales such as the Thames River, which seemed to play an important backdrop in this film.  Other London locations included Belsize Park, Maida Vale, Somerset House and Grosvenor House Hotel.  Lovely music is heard throughout the film, such as the song played during the closing credits, ""Where Do We Go,"" written and performed by Sandrine Daniels.

  ""Last Chance Harvey"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy romantic drama with substance, style and class.  Other poignant, emotionally charged films that fall into this category are ""Henry Poole is Here"" and ""The Visitor.""  All of these have been given the royal treatment by Anchor Bay Entertainment.",1243900800,,2697,4.716738197424893
3381035,4,B0015OKWKS,"I still hate romantic comedies but occasionally, I would try to see one just to keep my objectivities grounded. It is a good way to not become jaded with the types of movies I see, after all there is only too much action, fantasy and horror one can see in an extended period before one gets burned out. Heck, I may have just done this for a woman, but you never know. Anyway, Joel Hopkins' ""LAST CHANCE HARVEY"" has one of the most likable actors in the person of Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie, the Graduate) so I decided to give it a chance. Written and directed by Hopkins, the film is an endearing story of just how things just tend to work out in manner truly unexpected, and that taking a chance may lead to our happiness.

Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) is song writer who makes commercial jingles who lives in New York. He is having some work issues, as his boss is beginning to see him as the ""old guard"" in a new generation. Well, that's the least of his worries, as he flies to London to attend his daughter's wedding--he is informed that she will be asking her step father to give her away. To make things worst, Harvey missed his return flight and is on the verge of getting fired. Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) a woman who works in the statistics department. Kate is a nice lady who is committed to taking care of her mother. Harvey spends the next few hours talking with Kate that the two end up enjoying each other's company immensely. Harvey has one last chance at love, will fate bring them together?

The film's main draw would have to be the performances between Thompson and Hoffman. They play off each other nicely, and I thought it was endearing that Hoffman is a lot shorter than Thompson, it gives their uneasy relationship a needed `character'. The two do appear like they're common folk that you would see walking by. The two do develop some chemistry as the film goes on, the `getting to know you' part of their relationship happens mostly off-camera, which is why some people may not really buy into their `one day' relationship and may say they lacked chemistry. Well, the movie is about taking chances and complications; director Joel Hopkins does manage to flesh out our two leads in a manner I thought was effective.

The first act of the film is more about Harvey, when he arrives in London. He attends a party, with his ex-wife and daughter, and he unavoidably feels very alienated. Anyone would be bummed out when the step-father would be giving his daughter away. Then, Hopkins switches the scenes to see Kate taking care of her mom, then on a blind date that would not work out. It was also quite clever, the way Hopkins tossed in two missed opportunities for the two the meet, one in the airport and one in a cab. The screenplay by Hopkins gave the viewer a good amount of groundwork in fleshing out our two lead characters and remembers to put in a dose of fate into the mix. Only after Harvey misses his flight, with nothing to lose that the two finally get to talk in a bar/restaurant in the airport.

As the title implies, this movie is about Harvey Shine. For a film like this to succeed, it has to have certain heartbreaking moments and Dustin Hoffman delivers quite a few. The scene where he does the toast in the reception is definitely touching, and when he elaborates his failure as a father and as a husband to Kate, just made Harvey one VERY sympathetic character. Emma Thompson's Kate Walker also has her share of baggage's to carry, she seemed to have been stuck in a situation that she feels obligated to follow through. Kate gives hints to her very disappointing past, in the park and also in the film's final act. It was quite sad to see one used to disappointment that it became a routine of life for her.

Now, despite the charm and manner as to how Hopkins manages to get the two together, the film does have its flaws. While the direction manages to flesh out Harvey and Kate, the film focuses more on Harvey, and it feels that Kate's complications aren't as important or significant as those of Harvey's issues. Yes, Harvey does have the more unfortunate path, but I thought there were missed opportunities in fleshing out Kate's issues. I rather thought that the subplot with her mother and the next neighbor was fun and clever, but I was more curious about Kate's background. Kate feels like a supporting character rather than a lead. Harvey's character was obviously better written than hers. Also, the film falls into the usual stereotypical nuances that complicate a relationship in the last act. I thought it was very clich&eacute;d and feels a little long-winded. It would have been better to just have the `taking a chance' part take full circle; but then we see Harvey racing to the airport in pure stereotypical dramatic fashion.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is a charming, endearing tale about adult romance. Despite some plot mistakes, it was admirable in its penchant for adult relationships. It has good intentions but it does come up a little short. There were parts that I wished that this movie had limited supporting interactions and instead relied more on our two characters talking, it may have focused more on the ""taking a chance"" angle. Still, the dramatic performances by Hoffman and Thompson provide the film its needed zest, and the film gets a recommended rating from me.

Recommended! [3  Stars]

3381036,3,B0015OKWKS,"I seem to be on a bit of a romantic comedy streak lately, with another recent film viewing (and review) being the somewhat more silly and definitely younger (compared to this film) skewing film New In Town having been watched only a few days before watching this film.  Other than both being romantic comedies, there's really not much in common between that title and this one.

Last Chance Harvey was clearly aimed at providing a vehicle for a couple of actors a bit more long in the tooth, with the still somewhat boyishly looking Dustin Hoffman pairing up with Emma Thompson.  I note somewhat boyishly because if you research Hoffman's real age you may find it somewhat unbelievable that the young fellow that starred in The Graduate so long ago is as old as he really is (born in 1937).  Emma Thompson could easily be Hoffman's daughter given the differences in their ages (she was born in 1959), but that would be a different movie entirely (like say the movie Rumor Has It with Jennifer Aniston) and in reality Thompson stands well enough above Hoffman that you'd have to wonder a bit just who her mother would have had to be.

Despite those age differences, both work well enough for their roles here, as does a snow white haired James Brolin in a small part as the second husband of Harvey's (Hoffman) ex-wife.  Brolin is supposed to be an older gentleman compared to the younger Hoffman, even though Brolin is actually approx. 3 years younger than Hoffman.  With the white hair, Brolin certainly looks the part.

The basic premise of the story is that Harvey Shine is at a bit of a crossroads in his life.  He composes and plays music for commercial jingles.  His daughter (an American) is about to marry another American citizen, but the marriage is to take place in London (where both happen to be) so Harvey must travel even as he has a big deal in the works, perhaps a career breaking deal.  His boss tries to push Harvey to take plenty of time to attend the wedding signaling to Harvey that he's being pushed out of his job, even though he's sure he can still do it and still make the deal.  So, off Harvey goes to attend his estranged daughter's wedding, where he'll wind up (thanks to the writers and perhaps the alignment of the stars) crossing paths with Kate Walker (Thompson) a government employee (survey taker) in London.

In many ways this story is somewhat reminiscent of Lost in Translation, and honestly, in some ways I think the role of Harvey could easily have been filled by Bill Murray (who is a good bit closer to Thompson's age).  That said, I can't complain about Hoffman's performance here, though I wonder if I'd be more 'shocked' by the difference in the actors ages if I were to have seen this on high definition (Blu-ray) as opposed to standard definition DVD.  Regardless, the comparison to Lost in Translation is probably a pretty good one as both are pretty decent examples of character studies.

Honestly, this isn't really a traditional romantic comedy.  It's more serious, more mature, and realistically is a character study that happens to include some comedic elements than it is anything close to a romantic comedy.  There's not much silliness, and if one can overlook the contrivance of having both of the stars cross paths and form a strong bond in a short period of time, it doesn't really contain enough contrivances to qualify in the rom-com category.

I mention Blu-ray above and noted that I viewed this one on DVD (and not Blu-ray).  That's somewhat unusual for me, but in this case I had the DVD available, so that's what I viewed.  Surprisingly the DVD picture quality was pretty nice, while there were background images that weren't as sharp as I'd expect the Blu-ray would offer, the shots of the actors looked very nice.  That said, I wonder if perhaps those same shots would have shown more of Hoffman's age if viewed in high definition.

One thing that my wife and I did notice and which nagged at us a bit, as the film progresses along and Harvey and Kate begin to bond they take a bit of a journey around London that would seem to have occupied a considerable amount of time, yet, somehow, as if by magic they are able to arrive at another event at a key time.  How the day wasn't already fairly well exhausted and how they could get across town in time seems to be a point that we aren't supposed to notice or question.  Other than that though, the film seemed to just fine.

Last Chance Harvey was a decent film, and I might peg it at the 3-1/2 star level if offered the choice of using half stars here.  There's really nothing objectionable about it, and honestly it's somewhat difficult to give any real reason why I couldn't give the film 4 or even 5 stars other than just the feeling that while it's a good film it's not a great film and because of that falls back into the mid-range for me.

Is this one a purchase rather than rental material?  I'd have to say it's borderline.  For some it would make a great purchase, for others, probably not so much.  If possible rent first and then buy yourself a copy after you determine it's something you'd like to watch repeatedly, or perhaps buy a copy for friends and family that you think would enjoy it.",1243814400,,5220,4.556745182012848

3381038,4,B0015OKWKS,"We started watching this movie knowing it was a love story between two middle-aged people.  What we found was a heart-tugging, melancholy slice of life...of two misfits on the outside, looking in.  The time-frame of the story is over a weekend.  Harvey has come to London from the USA to attend the wedding of his estranged daughter.  Kate works at the airport in London, and has gone nowhere with her life, is single, and resigned to her lot in life.  Harvey's job is on the skids, and he is planning to return to the states as soon as he can to save it.  He discovers that his daughter Susan has asked her stepfather to give her away instead of him....low blow!  During the wedding Harvey feels much like the 5th wheel, just hanging around on the sidelines, so he does not stay to attend the reception. Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date and feeling like a fish out of water, while everyone else around her is chatting, and having a good time....and her equally lonely mother keeps calling on her cell phone!  Finally, at the airport after the wedding ceremony, Harvey and Kate meet and realize that they are both kindred spirits plodding along in this sorry life.  They discover a mutual attraction of their alone-ness and build a friendship on it, that turns into more.  She convinces him to return to the reception and try to renew his relationship with his daughter...a very good scene!  He proves to her that he will always be there for her, even with an unexpected event. The story is both sad and happy, and was beautifully done owing to the performances of the outstanding actors Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Did not really see anything that would qualify this movie as a comedy...bittersweet, yes!  I think that most people could relate to some facets of this sad, but sweet story.",1243814400,,1798,4.616352201257862
3381039,3,B0015OKWKS,"At its best, this rather slight 2008 melding of comedy and drama reminds me of Ulu Grosbard's bittersweet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falling-in-Love/dp/B00005S6K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falling in Love</a>&nbsp;(1984) in which Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep stumble into a romantic relationship constantly derailed by guilt and commuter train schedules. At its worst, this film - leisurely directed and written by Joel Hopkins - uses several well-worn cinematic conventions - including a familiar third-act plot device from a classic movie - and forces a predictable ending that is far from satisfying. On the upside, it certainly helps to have actors the caliber of Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson in the principal roles, although I have to admit I was not taken in by their characters' halting romance because the actors are simply not meshing in a convincing way. In fact, this movie ironically works better when the actors perform in separate scenes away from each other. The problem is that the elfin Hoffman just tries too hard to overcome Thompson's self-protective demeanor of disappointment.

The story focuses on Harvey Shine, a divorced jingle writer whose career seems to be waning in the face of more youthful talent. At the same time, his daughter Susan is getting married in England, so he is anxious to offset his professional disappointments with a family reunion he really needs. However, their estrangement turns out to be deeper than expected since Susan tells him that she has already asked her rugged, engaging stepfather to give her away at the wedding. When he concludes that it is he who has become the family outsider, he meets Kate Walker, an airport employee who has the thankless task of surveying passengers coming off their flights. She also happens to be a lonely spinster who lives near her paranoid mother and finds the prospect of another failed blind date excruciating. Kate and Harvey meet-cute at a Heathrow lounge at their lowest emotional points, and they start to bond over long walks along London's South Bank. She convinces him to go to Susan's reception, and he agrees only if Kate becomes his date. The rest of the plot follows the story arc you would expect.

In perhaps a conscious move, Hoffman seems to be channeling a bit of Benjamin Braddock's schlubby, obsessive nature in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Graduate/dp/B00000F798/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Graduate</a>&nbsp;over forty years later. He is at his best when we feel Harvey's rejection in isolation, but the assertive approach the 71-year-old actor takes in courting Kate is challenging to embrace. Thompson, on the other hand, is a pure joy as Kate because she plays against the grain of what could have been a victim character. She wears Kate's disappointment in such a convincingly objective manner that her moments of heartache attain greater resonance. Eileen Atkins and Kathy Baker have just a few scenes to bring their characters to life, Kate's dotty mother and Harvey's still-resentful ex-wife, respectively. London looks pretty inviting thanks to John de Borman's crisp cinematography, though Dickon Hinchliffe's tinkling music punctuates the proceedings excessively. The 2009 DVD contains a nice audio commentary track with Hoffman (recorded separately), Hopkins and a particularly acerbic Thompson. The sixteen-minute featurette reflects the same personalities in a standard making-of format, although both this and the theatrical trailer give away too much of the plot.",1243728000,,3599,5.626151012891344
3381050,4,B0015OKWKS,"Harvey Shine is down to last chances:  his job as a commercial jingle writer is hanging by a thread; his estranged daughter is getting married, giving him perhaps one last chance to reconcile and make amends, and his lonely life has perhaps one last chance at romance.  He flies to London for the weekend to attend the wedding, only to get a cool reception from the wedding party, and when his daughter tearfully informs him that she wants her stepfather (James Brolin) to give her away, you can see his heart break.  Meanwhile, never-married Kate Walker has a thankless job as an airport survey taker, and a demanding mother (Eileen Atkins).  When she's set up on yet another blind date, this time with a younger man who ends up paying more attention to some friends he runs into the bar, you can feel her loneliness.  After ducking out of the wedding after the ceremony, missing his flight, and learning that he's about to be sacked, Harvey comes to drown his sorrows in an airport lounge and meets Kate (for the second time, it turns out).  Once they start trading barbed comments, you know this one is on a familiar romantic comedy track.  But what makes this movie work is the two principals:  Hoffman and Thompson are two Oscar-winners who are always a joy to watch, and together they make terrific chemistry.  As it happens, they first met when filming ""Stranger than Fiction"" a couple of years ago, and despite sharing only a scene or two in that film, they instantly clicked and became friends.  So they eagerly agreed to work on this project, only the second feature directed by writer/director Joel Hopkins.  The featurette on the DVD gives us some insight into their working relationship, and it turns out much of the chemistry is very real and some of the scenes were even improvised.  They capture perfectly the bond of two lonely and apparently different people, and the magic that a middle-aged romance can generate. (And how many good ""middle-aged romance"" comedies have you seen lately?)  They even transcend a plot twist straight out of ""An Affair to Remember"". The supporting cast is strong too, especially Atkins, Brolin, and Kathy Baker (playing Harvey's ex-wife). It doesn't hurt, either, that the film is beautifully shot in London, perhaps my favorite city in the world. I heartily recommend this film - it's a serviceable story, by turns funny and poignant, and buoyed by the excellent performances of its two main characters.",1243728000,,2452,4.823389021479714
3381051,3,B0015OKWKS,"Admittedly, director Joel Hopkins wants to tell a love story about two life's-got-me-down individuals in his film ""Last Chance Harvey"" starring Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.  Without the added accoutrement of madcap comedy or the usual boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl entanglements, he does manage to showcase two actors with some pleasant chemistry between them in a fairly realistic storyline that promenades to a satisfying conclusion.

Physically, Thompson and Hoffman have a difficult time cutting a rug together.  She towers over him considerably which makes for some awkward footage of the two of them walking along the Thames and dancing at a wedding reception.  Not that any of this really matters, the duo share a companionable attraction for one another that offsets (most of the time) their corporal disparity.  Hoffman, as Harvey Shine, remains a conglomerate of his best known character studies:  he mixes a little of Rain Man's doggedness, Michael Dorsey's/Tootsie's clumsiness and the Graduate's insouciance to inject Harvey with the lifeblood of Hoffman's usually depicted anti-hero.  His portrait of Harvey smacks of realism that adds another dimension to an otherwise ordinary screenplay.

Likewise, as Kate Walker, the incomparable Emma Thompson knows how to play a nuanced mature woman on the brink of throwing in the towel after so many years of mediocrity.  Her tired willingness in dealing with her job and her frustrated ministrations to her needy mother (the wonderful Eileen Atkins) rings with the quiet truth of the many who are life's caretakers rather than actual participants.  Hopefulness beams on her face with the timidity of all things tenuous; we don't want her to be disappointed and cannot hold back our winces when Harvey/Hoffman faux-pas with extraordinary gaucheness.

Nevertheless, their coupling does work as an older couple meeting and falling in love despite a plotline heaped with so many dour situations it makes the audience cringe with dismay.  In a film where nothing really happens, a lot happens between the two leads supported by a cast of experts that put the ""A"" in archetypical.  Look for a snowy-haired James Brolin as the warm and witty stepfather, Kathy Baker as the still-annoyed ex-wife and Liane Balaban as the daughter caught in past crossfire.

Bottom line?  ""Last Chance Harvey"" will not rock your world in either a big or small movie way.  However performances by Thompson and Hoffman do crackle with some electricity that make the 90+ minutes of viewing time worthwhile.  Recommended.

3381053,4,B0015OKWKS,"'Last Chance Harvey' is a movie I really liked more than I thought possible.  Set in London, the slow-paced story is about Harvey Shine, a work-a-holic distanced from his only daughter.  He flies to England for her wedding, feeling like an outsider when told that her stepfather will be giving her away instead of him; of course, her decision could have been based on Harvey telling her that he didn't plan to stay for the reception.  He strikes up a romance with Kate Walker, who works for the airline, after they have lunch together discussing who has had the worst day.

This movie is a love story that focuses on the heart, not mushy smutty crapola.  The sub-plot focuses on a father rebuilding the relationship with his daughter he lost spending too much time on his career.  Bits of humor paired with the stunning London backdrop round this into a movie easily enjoyed by everyone.

This is a movie I would highly recommend.",1243555200,,930,4.668711656441718
3381054,4,B0015OKWKS,"Well I loved this movie! People reviewing here said that they didn't buy that Emma Thompson's character is too attractive not to find a man - TOTALLY missing the point . . she just doesn't connect with most men and really doesn't want to even bother. And Dustin Hoffman - I think many men can relate to him as well - woman too. That feeling that in a whole room of people you just will never, ever 'get' the whole thing. You'd rather stay in your hotel room and read the phone book. The only thing I didn't agree with was when Dustin Hoffman gave the father of the bride speech (most of it was great!) and he said that he daughter turned out to be so lovely and kind, etc. even though she was from a broken home. IF she was so kind, why would she have her step-father walk her down the aisle? Yeah, I know, he wasn't a good father - but that was REALLY hitting below the belt - this from a sweet, kind daughter?

It could easily have sunk to being just another slice of ""Lifetime"" channel style ""movies for women"" dreck, but the film is redeemed completely by the superior performances of the two ""overcast"" -- as in ""over qualified"" lead actors -- Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.

Dustin Hoffman is so pathetic in this movie which makes him more likable in an odd way, and I was rooting for him to come out on top. I love how he's shorter than Emma, it's cute.

I like that this whole movie takes place over the span of a short weekend in London, and it's mostly realistic. It's just so sweet. I don't know that I would watch this again even though it ends on a high note. It's not the regular romantic comedy with all the hoopla and the jokes and the attractive young couples that we're used to seeing, but it's definitely more than worthy of sitting on the shelf beside or even above those predictable flicks.",1243209600,5,866,4.3128834355828225
3381058,4,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey""  is an interesting slant on romantic movies.  Harvey (Dustin Hoffman) and Kate (Emma Thompson) are likable, middle-aged professionals who've resigned themselves to being single for the rest of their lives.  They keep themselves busy so that they won't notice how lonely they really are.  Harvey writes piano compositions in his spare time.  Kate takes writing classes and is forever taking phone calls from her mother (Eileen Atkins), concerned about her daughter's spinsterhood.  The film has its requisite ""meet cute"" scene -- three in fact -- as Harvey and Kate coincidentally meet time after time in London, where Harvey is attending his daughter's wedding.  Despite its formulaic structure, ""Last Chance Harvey"" works because of its two stars, who have terrific on-screen chemistry.  We believe them as the characters they're playing and we go along for the pleasant ride.
Blu-ray extras include a making-of featurette and audio commentary with Hoffman, Thompson and writer/director Joel Hopkins.",1243209600,2,1022,5.506410256410256

With all the teen-age fluff put out by Hollywood it's nice to see a smart movie for a grown up audience. Hoffman is his usual charming and lovable self, while Thompson perfectly plays an intelligent but insecure woman approaching middle age. This is how life as a single adult (I was one until age 37) really feels and I could relate to these characters on a very profound level.

3381081,2,B0015OKWKS,"I see that a number of people gave this movie positive reviews. My experience in seeing it was not all that terribly positive. I suppose when I see a movie that's descibed as a romantic movie, I expect a somewhat uplifting story that makes me feel good. This movie was not that type of movie in my opinion. A large part at the start of the movie is dedicated to making the main characters look about as destitute and sad as possible, beyond the point where you can still imagine some kind of happy turnaround later. When the time comes for them to finally meet, the Harvey character seems to step out of character to a degree and become almost a quasi-stalker. Rather than being charming, he comes across as a pushy older guy looking to latch on to a younger female. I felt that there was very little chemistry between the two characters and seemingly little in common to attract them to one another other than their mutual status as sad and lonely people. Finally, it seemed like a lot of the aspects of the movie were sort of forced and not very realistic. It's hard to believe Harvey is a musician, that his daughter would be getting married in London, that he would be so spontaneous as to do all the things he does in the last half of the movie, that he could afford to just keep hanging out in expensive London hotels when he has obviously been down on his luck with his job, and the list goes on. I suppose if you are a fan of Hoffman you might find this to be yet another interesting performance, or if you are a fan of Thompson's portratal of a sad character, you might like her performance. If you are looking for a feel-good romantic movie, look elsewhere.",1242777600,4,1667,4.363344051446945

 Those movie lovers who want break neck pace will likely yawn at best during this film. But those hungry for movies that inspire and challenge and feed the need for peaceful introspection should find  whetted, if not satisfied, appetites upon tasting  this sweet and simple film.

Refreshingly clean, other than a few sexual comments and a burst of sh---ys  it's almost family friendly and should appeal the Hallmark-type- movie lover's palate. Character collectors should like the subtle and layered realistic humans in the capable hands of Thompson and Hoffman.

3381083,4,B0015OKWKS,"I love both Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson and was very happy to see them in a quirky romance together.  It was a nice little film perfect for snuggling on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn and relaxing with before bed.  It had just enough romance and heartache to interest the girls and enough laughs to keep the guys awake.

It is as someone said previously very formulaic.  I guessed what was going to happen in one scene before it did (read too many screenwriter books dear?) and completely astonished my spouse and son with my prescient announcement of the plot point that would impact the relationship of the charming couple.

Harvey is a jingle writer in New York who is so busy in the advertising business that he is anxious about leaving for London for his daughter's wedding.  Kate is a lonely manager of a group of Marketers at Heathrow airport interviewing travelers as they arrive (I did this at Graceland once for a few extra bucks it isn't fun).  The two meet incidentally as a harried Harvey arrives and Kate is rebuffed by him.

Harvey arrives and finds his ex wife has hidden him off far away for he is somewhat of a selfish boor.  He meets his daughter and we can tell he loves her but seems to put business first.  After a series of embarrassments he decides he will leave right after the wedding.

Kate lives alone and is constantly harassed by her mother who needs a lot of attention (there is a comic subplot between the mom and a neighbor) and is constantly fixed up with blind dates by her coworkers.  She is very lonely but afraid of being hurt.

The two meet in the airport bar when Harvey misses his flight back to New York and will have to spend another day in the UK.  They strike up a conversation and find a mutual respect for one another.  Harvey too is lonely and depressed and decides to spend the day with her.

The rest of the story is fairly predictable yet I believe you will enjoy how Kate helps Harvey reconcile with his family and his dreams and how Harvey helps Kate overcome her loneliness and fears.",1242691200,,2049,4.424
3381084,2,B0015OKWKS,"It's sad to see two brilliant actors like Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson trying vainly to kick some life into this pallid romantic comedy that isn't very funny or romantic. What it is is entirely predictable, full of cliches and thoroughly mediocre.
Both these stars seem to have disappeared from movies recently. If they thought this tired vehicle would revive their flagging careers, they are dead wrong.
Hoffman plays a 60-something composer of advertising jingles down on his luck, flying to London to attend his daughter's wedding. When he arrives, he finds he's been shouldered out of his role as father of the bride by his ex-wife's second husband. To make matters worse, he's informed by phone he's lost his job.
Thompson is a 40-something, left on the shelf as love passes her by. The two meet up in an airport bar and strike up what the scriptwriters try to pretend is an attraction. Actually, there's no real chemistry between them; both are just reading their badly-written lines.
The real star of his movie is the city of London which looks brilliant.

This movie is a beautiful exercise in real story telling. These two seasoned actors bring incredible meaning and depth to a movie about real things that happen to people in real life. I was touched by the obvious and not so obvious messages in this story and feel it was, for me, a much awaited change from the fast-paced, meaningless bumblers Hollywood keeps ralphing out.

But in this movie, we both agreed that these two actors---Hoffman and Thompson ---were doing fine work and bringing spark and originality to what other reviewers have called a traditional romantic comedy.

Both these stars hit it just right, and director-writer Joel Hopkins lets them add just the right touch of realism ---like Thompson slowly getting ignored out on a blind date, and Hoffman getting insecure and lonely by himself --with initial loss of his bride-daughter to her step father, and sudden loss of his job.

By themselves they are not faring well, but together, they are like an army of 10. I really admired Thomson's Kate, who quickly helps Hoffman's Harvey reunite with his daughter, and the rest of the family.

Early on, I was pulling for these two people to make it ---in romantic London.  And worried that they might not, given the details that had to fall in place.

My wife was more realistic, but she too was in their corner.

So be sure to take this movie in, especially with someone close to you. It will be a fine evening, and you will wind up enriched and ready for the frustrations and surprises we all encounter almost every day.

3381087,3,B0015OKWKS,"""Last Chance Harvey"" is a Romantic Comedy, but different from its brethren because:

1. The man and woman in question are not glamorous-looking twenty-somethings.
2. They are in fact played by Academy Award winning performers.

Other than that ""Harvey"" has much in common.
1. There is a ""meet cute"".  All romantic comedies must have the ""boy-meets-girl"" scene, and since the leads are played by Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson, this scene is a little better than most.  This if followed by one of those genre montages where our couple walks blissfully around London getting to know each other, except that we hear the soundtrack and see their smiling faces rather than listen to their dialogue.  (If your movie stars Hoffman and Thompson, wouldn't you WANT them to be talking and smiling instead of just smiling?)
2. There is a scene where Harvey and Kate are supposed to meet for a ""second date"", and one of them is unable to make it for a reason that the other person would instantly understand if they only knew, but they don't know, leading the other person to think that they've been stood up.
3. There is a variation on my least favorite Romantic Comedy clich - the scene near the end when it looks like they're not going to be together, but the male character realizes he's making a Big Mistake and rushes to the airport to catch his destiny.  Most of the variation in THIS rendition of the clich comes because Kate WORKS at the airport, so Harvey has to meet her there.

Several romantic comedies have featured ""lovable losers"", but I suppose that the ""twist"" in this story is that Harvey has ""hit bottom"".  He wanted to be a jazz pianist, but his ability is only good enough to write music to accompany television commercials.  Even in this dreams-not-achieved world he is barely hanging onto his job as he flies to London for the wedding of his estranged daughter.  The daughter is completely assimilated into the world of the ex-wife and the step-father.  Harvey is an uncomfortable fish out of water.  Kate seems at least secure in her job as an airport poll-taker, although her social life's highlight is her mother, who phones about once an hour to describe the strange goings-on of her neighbor.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is well-done fluff, the film equivalent of cotton candy.",1242086400,2,2290,4.752525252525253

3381100,4,B0015OKWKS,"While visiting London for his daughter's wedding, American Harvey Shine (Dustin Hoffman) has a series of disappointments.  He realizes that he's been a bad father, which is not surprising considering that he seems more interested in his job as a commercial songwriter.  When his job starts to fall apart too, he feels as though he has one final chance to set things straight in his life.  Enter Kate Walker (Emma Thompson), a 40-something singleton who feels as though she has one final chance - in her case it's to fall in love.  Unfortunately, she's not finding it on the blind dates her caring friends set up for her.

""Last Chance Harvey"" is a sweet, breezy romantic comedy.  What obviously sets it apart is the age of its leads; whereas most rom-coms feature ingenues in their 20s or early 30s (often matched with an older actor), Thompson is 49 and Hoffman is 71 years old.  Falling in love at their age, with a lifetime of prior disappointments behind them, feels risky to them.  It's not like being young and being able to abandon one's self to love.  Thompson in particular perfectly captures this sense of desperation mixed with fear of being hurt and humiliated.  She is luminous and totally believable as the star of a rom-com, although one who's been around the block a few times.  As is typical for movies, she is paired with an older actor; how interesting it would have been to have an actor closer to her age, but that's a minor quibble.

The movie is filled with gentle, insightful humor.  The subplot with Thompson's xenophobic mother (Dame Eileen Atkins) was amusing but seemed disconnected from the main plot and detracted somewhat from the movie.  Otherwise, ""Last Chance Harvey"" is pitch perfect throughout.  Second-time director Joel Hopkins (""Jump Tomorrow"") wisely keeps things very simple, and the movie's relatively short run time also helps keep things interesting.  There's nothing terribly unique about ""Last Chance Harvey,"" but it's so well acted and genuine that it scores an easy bull's eye.",1241740800,5,2025,4.894428152492669

These two fantastic actors truly carry this movie. I can rewatch this film over and over again and it'll be just as delightful every single time.",1241740800,6,443,4.620253164556962
3381102,4,B0015OKWKS,"It seems these days that theaters across the country are filled with the latest blockbuster, always a techno touch of wizardry that titillate the audience while at the same time offering total entertainment but little meat to the bones. But occasionally a film comes along that deals with emotions, usually a small film without major pizzazz. LAST CHANCE HARVEY is such a film and one worth seeing.

Dustin Hoffman plays Harvey Shine, a jingle writer for a large advertising firm. Out of touch with the electronic music era and more in touch with actual instruments, Harvey is the last of his kind, so much so that if his latest account doesn't sell he's out of work.

This particular weekend Harvey is to fly to London for his daughter's wedding. Divorced from her mother for some time, one gets the feeling that Harvey was always more concerned with career than family. His daughter's closeness to her mother and step father proves this later on.

Kate Walker (Emma Thompson) is a 40something woman who works for a survey company asking questions of travelers as they disembark from their planes in London. Kate constantly has to take care of her mother either by visit or via cell phone non stop. It is through her job that she first bumps into Harvey as he abruptly brushes her off.

Harvey hits the hotel booked for him only to find out that everyone else is staying in a house his ex-wife has booked for the entire party. He does finally get the chance to be with the wedding party though as they gather the night before the wedding. Hoffman's Harvey gets to show off his somewhat out of place character as he takes cell phone calls for work and stumbles about, both physically and verbally. It is on this night that Harvey's daughter informs him that she intends to have her step father (played by James Brolin) to walk her down the aisle. Crushed but understanding, Harvey retreats to his room.

The next day Harvey has the chance to see his daughter married, but has to return home for a business meeting thus missing the reception. Due to traffic he misses his plane and is summarily fired by his boss. While having a drink he bumps into Kate once again who acts stand offish but eventually sees something nice in Harvey. The pair spend the day together as Harvey invites himself into her life, eventually inviting her into his when he asks her to accompany him to the reception.

The pair makes a nice fit. Both have been up and down in the world of romance and both have battle scars to prove it. But at the reception Harvey gets a chance to come out of his shell, winning back his daughter's affection and perhaps the heart of a woman he just met.

The title of the film sums it up. This is Harvey's last chance. Not just at the job he has (though hates, wishing he was a jazz piano player instead) but life as well. He may have lost his old family, but a chance at romance that blossoms naturally with someone he's just met makes for a heartwarming story that captures the essence of what love is all about.

Not the love we seems to find offered all the time in films these days where teenage angst and romance involves who can get whom into bed first, but a deeper more meaningful affection that will last when the physical passion retreats. The emotions shared between the characters of Harvey and Kate, two people who meet and fall in love in a day, is something that perhaps older viewers can relate to better. Too bad younger ones will miss this one for the next teen pop tart, never realizing what true love is all about.

Hoffman has always done a fantastic job. He turns in a subtle performance here, one that I think is better than I've seen from him in recent years. He's relaxed in the skin of Harvey Shine. Thompson does an upstanding job as well, bringing the woman on the verge of spinsterhood alive as she sees an opportunity present itself but at the same time fears the consequences should it fail, while loss of love inflicts pain on everyone, loss of love at the later stages of life offers more mortal wounds.

This movie was missed by many when it hit theaters. It is one of the joys of DVD releases that the opportunity to see something as special as this presents itself. Theaters offer 18 screens, 12 of which offer the same 3 blockbuster films. Movies like this get lost in the shuffle. Not so when it comes to DVD.

So pick up LAST CHANCE HARVEY. Sit down with someone you care for and enjoy it. Give them a hug or two. And thanks to DVD, this won't be the last chance you get to see a film that deserved more attention.",1241481600,6,4561,4.463385354141657

""Romantic comedy""? WHAT comedy? I kept waiting for something funny to happen... maybe something worth even chuckling at... something to even stimulate a fleeting smile???

It was like watching water while waiting for it to come to a boil. Without the stove turned on....

""Comedy"" takes at least some energy for it to be successful. This was the anti-energy movie. The black hole of energy. It should be classified as an energy disaster and a drain on the world's energy resources. The EPA should ban it.

3381105,1,B0015OKWKS,"(1.) I figured out why Hoffman (Harvey) seems to always be in movies about dysfunctional males. In fact, he's now typecast to do similar voiceovers in children's animations. It's because when the cliched story is old and tiresome you need someone who is a natural sounding bumbling character. That makes the movie and character believable and thus easier to swallow.
(2.) The movie as a whole is one unrealistic scene after another that includes Harvey in a parking garage where a phone call from his boss says he lost his job; he lost the love of his wife and older daughter for reasons not clear; he makes everyday decision mistake after mistake as the movie plods on. And Emma, an attractive, engaging, intelligent middle age woman has never had a serious relationship - sure! It's difficult to have any empathy for a story about misfortune that reads like a cheap romance novelette. You keep waiting for some unique and interesting development to occur to mark it as different from all the similar movies but you keep waiting and waiting while the slowly evolving improbable chain of events unfold and the  monologues continue to be simplistic and predictable.

3381109,4,B0015OKWKS,"LAST CHANCE HARVEY is a totally predictable, yet very charming romantic comedy that works because of the immense likability of its two stars, Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson.

New Yorker Dustin and Londoner Emma are two strangers who lead lonely, unhappy lives.  He's a frustrated composer, musician, making a good living writing jingles for commercials, while she conducts polls at the London airport, while dealing with a dotty mother (Eileen Atkins) who thinks that her new neighbor is a serial killer.

When Dustin, his job hanging by a thread, flies to London to attend his somewhat estranged daughter's wedding, he and Emma meet by chance.

There is instant chemistry between them and, over the course of a day, they have such an effect on each other that both their lives are completely turned around.

As previously stated, there's nothing particularly unique about the story.  This is just a ""feel good"" movie.

Kathy Baker, James Brolin and Richard Schiff co-star in the picture, written and directed by Joel Hopkins.

I want something to inspire and uplift me, not bring me down in fear and bum me out. Romantic comedies seem to be the best choice generally for that--for me, at least.

So tonight, I watched for the second time, a great movie with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson called, Last Chance Harvey. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it, but the reason I bring it up at all is the message it gave me.

Harvey, played by Dustin Hoffman, was a down on his luck musician creating jingles and about to get fired because he isn't keeping up with the times and is not selling very well. He goes to London to see his daughter's wedding. He's been divorced and single for some time.

Before leaving, he is freaked out that the youngsters are taking over and he tells his boss he will be back in a couple days to help close a deal. He gets to the airport to come home and misses his plane and ends up getting fired over the phone.

When this kind of scenario comes, it can have a huge effect on people. Some get really depressed, despondent, and otherwise angry at life dealing them a bad break, others take it in stride and some get excited. I saw Harvey get excited after a very short spurt of feeling sorry for himself, and part of that was meeting Kate played by Emma Thompson.

In short order, Harvey gets completely turned around, his life is exciting again, he's interested and focused and alive. Change has come at a perfect time and released him from the burden he was carrying that he didn't even know he was carrying. It's the martyr in us. . .

It reminded me a bit of when I got fired last and it was such a relief when it came that I felt like running up and down the boulevard screaming with joy! It was an incredible rush of joy and it lasted pretty much that entire day! Thank God! I said. That opportunity led me to where I am now, in more joy than I have ever felt and doing what I absolutely love to do.

You just never know when a sudden change can refocus your life and direct you to far better things and surroundings than you ever thought possible. Sometimes we hang on to things we dislike so much because we fear the unknown if we were to let them go. It is the sudden change of a firing or something like this that can be like dynamite unblocking the logjam in our lives. It is truly a blessing.

The other lesson that comes with this is to just be open to change, to embrace change and to always be open to opportunity and to release fear which is a false friend.",1493683200,,2600,4.206827309236948

8259356,5,B0015OKWKS,"Yes, a light little middle-age romance story, but it works so incredibly well. Masterfully conveyed by these two legends of cinema.  A great movie for anyone who has ever been ostracized, kicked around, or taken advantage of (and who hasn't been)  but these characters have also been their own worst enemies in life.  This is the last chance for both of them to get it right. The story is very ordinary in one sense but extraordinary in another; that being, that sometimes even the worst messes people make of their lives can turn out OK.",1477526400,4,538,4.6421052631578945
