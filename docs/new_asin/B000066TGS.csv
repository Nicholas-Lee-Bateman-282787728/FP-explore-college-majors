1713760,3,B000066TGS,"Here's the basic plot: A pack of money-grabbing, extremely rich and attractive relatives (the Ferretti's) are trying to take over their ailing uncle's industrial empire.
The pack is led by Maurizio Ferretti (played brilliantly by Billy Zane), a rich, very savy and attractive million dollar playboy...his main goal is to take over the family's million dollar business while his Uncle Leo is dying in a hospital somewhere. And how does he plan on doing this? Black-mailing his father, sleeping w/ numerous women (for pleasure AND to get what he wants, of course) and being an all around money hungry, scheming jerk!
Lauren Hutton plays Cristina, Uncle Leo's estranged wife who seems to be the only one staying at his bedside...
Carol Alt plays the beautiful (...)/wild child/bad seed niece who can't seem to keep her clothes on or get her life on track...and Alexandra Paul plays the promiscuous, (...), seductive, cold-hearted sister in-law. The plot is okay, but aside from the characters listed above, the acting [is bad]. And even though this movie was released in 1991, the bad hair and fashion looks like something out of a late 80's movie.
Lauren Hutton looks ravishing, Billy Zane is extra-yummy, and Carol Alt is extremely pretty...even Alexandra Paul (known for the flat-chested plain jane Lt. Stephanie Holden on Baywatch) gets into the seductive-(...)-queen role rather well.
But nothing can save the cheap quality, chessy (...) soundtrack, blah acting, and bad ending. If you have a hour or so to kill and don't mind seeing Billy Zane sleep w/ a bunch of women, including his cousin, his sister in law, and his dad's mistress or watching a bunch of rich spoiled people plot, whine, and (...) each other - then go ahead and pick this one up. I guess it can't hurt, call it a guilty pleasure.",1080259200,14,1802,4.911475409836066

All of it pales in comparison to the real world illegal seizure of everybody's stocks authorized by the Securities & Exchange Commission and of all bonds perpetrated by the US Treasury Department into the permanent adverse possession of the criminally slopperated ""computers"" of the fraud and theft industry in felony abrogation of Article IV of the US Constitution Amendments.",1510531200,,520,5.92

7962461,3,B000066TGS,"The original Italian name of MILLIONS was ""Millardi.""

""Money is the root of all evil"" is the message here. Billy Zane plays the avaricious nephew of Leo Feretti (Sorel), a globetrotting financier who's now in failing health. When not maneuvering in every underhanded way imaginable to capture his still-breathing uncle's fortune, the immature Zane acts upon massive satyric impulses with a bevy of bellissima bambini.

Idyllic locations and beautiful but unlikeable people can't redeem this Continental-style soap opera.

It turns out that this parable is actually a Christmas movie--a rather good Christmas movie, so my only complaint is that either Amazon or the distributor needs to be more careful in verifying that the movie send to the customer is the movie the customer actually ordered, and not a movie with the same title.",1323043200,,460,4.679012345679013
