7936712,3,B00005B6KQ,"The ONLY reason why this rises to three stars is because of the extras. Both of the features included here are terrible and boring. In their day I'm sure that they were hot; ""Notorious Daughter"" is from 1964 and has very little exposure, and ""Head Mistress"" is from the late '60s and features much more, but neither of them is very interesting.

Without extras we're looking at a two-star review here, if not a one-star. But  the extras are fantastic, including two very interesting commentaries with the producer, several short features and a load of trailers that don't shy away from full nudity.",1423440000,3,598,4.796116504854369

7936716,2,B00005B6KQ,"This Something Weird Video double feature of producer David F. Friedman's nudies ""The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill"" and ""The Head Mistress"" is something of a letdown, saved only by Friedman's commentary on both movies. ""Fanny Hill"" features Stacey Walker in the title role, and while she's a riveting screen presence, her face and body alone are not enough to make this movie compelling viewing for 70 minutes. The thin narrative is ideal for porn, but not enough to sustain this tease of movie. Even Friedman notes that this ""audaciously adult"" movie would only get a PG-13 rating if released today. Like most movies of this type, the acting is second rate at best and anachronisms abound (I don't think ball point pens and polyester negligees were too common in the Victorian era). For what it is though, the production values are above average.

""The Head Mistress"" is cheaper and tackier, but a lot more entertaining. The movie opens with 1960s women pretending to be 17th century schoolgirls enjoying a topless picnic--as 17th century schoolgirls are won't to do--drinking punch out of plastic cups and munching cookies off Chinet plates. From there, we move on to the sex scenes, which are more explicit than what you'd see in ""Fanny Hill,"" but not by much. Imagine a man pinning a naked woman to the bed while she suffers an epileptic seizure and you get the idea. The head mistress herself, the ample-bodied Marsha Jordan, is in ""the twilight world,"" i.e. she's an insatiable lesbian. Marsha nuzzles the tummies of her naked charges while they lie there staring vacantly. Marsha even whips one of the mischievous minxes, and she still doesn't get much of a reaction. She gets more response from a plant in a scene that employs high school play caliber special effects. To distract you from this fact, Marsha Jordan keeps her breasts bared. The hypnotic power of Marsha's nipples can only sustain a movie for so long, though. For the last ten minutes of the movie I kept checking the clock. Like ""Fanny Hill,"" this one's more interesting viewed with Friedman's commentary.

Like other Something Weird DVDs, there are trailers and short subjects included with the extras. This DVD includes trailers for other Friedman-produced and Fanny Hill-themed movies (""Brand of Shame,"" ""Fanny Hill and the Red Barron,"" ""The Lustful Turk,"" etc.), a Stacey Walker short and a brief bit of video from when SWV raided Friedman's movie vault. The trailers and the Stacey Walker short (""But Charlie, I Never Played Volleyball"") are amusing, but the movie vault raid is a viewing experience akin to watching a video of someone else's vacation.",1044403200,19,2635,4.959276018099548
7936717,2,B00005B6KQ,"This series of ""weird"" films is very hit and miss and this is unfortunately the latter.  I can't even remember what it's about but I can advise against buying it.
Probably not the best review you've read but if I had read this I would have saved myself a few dollars and that's good enough for me.",1035244800,7,297,4.2105263157894735
7936718,5,B00005B6KQ,"This is a fantastic double feature!  Something Weird Video presents two classic ""nudie-cutie"" costume features along with great supplementary material.
THE NOTORIOUS DAUGHTER OF FANNY HILL (directed by Peter Perry) is easily the best of the two films.  Starring Stacey Walker as the amorous daughter of the sex-wild Fanny Hill, the aptly-named Miss Kissy Hill who employs herself as a high-class courtesan who caters to the desires of the crowned heads of Europe.  Stacey Walker is given little to do but swan around the set in a blue negligee and fishnet stockings, and the bizarre song ""I Love Love"" just adds to the camp value.  The beautifully-restored print on offer here looks fabulous.
THE HEAD MISTRESS (directed by Byron Mabe) is the weaker of the two features in terms of charm but far more explicit in terms of on-screen flesh.  Starring the Queen of the nudie-cutie, the legendary Marsha Jordan, the story concerns a girl's school whose nubile young delicacies are serviced by the handsome new gardener who comes to be employed there.
The special features include the short subject ""But Charley, I Never Played Volleyball"" which again features Stacey Walker, and a scene from the Stacey Walker classic ""A Smell Of Honey"".  There is also a clip from the first time Mike Vraney and Something Weird Video was allowed to raid the extensive vaults of producer David Friedman.  Along with a fantastic gallery from the many films helmed by Friedman and rare radio spots for his films.  There is also a fun commentary for both films supplied by David Friedman being interviewed by Mike Vraney.
A fantastic package and very nice for the price.  Be sure to check out the many other double features on offer from Something Weird Video including GIRL GANG/THE VIOLENT YEARS and ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER MAN/BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL.",1013644800,18,1823,4.950819672131147
7936719,3,B00005B6KQ,"A pair of fun, silly movies at a bargain price.  The best part here is the (optional) commentary by David Freidman.  These films are vintage nudie flicks, not Lawrence of Arabia, so the low budget production shouldn't be a problem.  I also don't believe you need a strong stomach to watch these movies, unless you're very very sensitive.
Thank the powers that be that there's a place ...to make these films available to those of us who like this stuff!",1003276800,10,452,4.625
7936720,2,B00005B6KQ,"Funny, kinky and not particularly well made, this film is for anyone who likes unusual films and possesses a strong stomach.",992736000,2,124,4.9523809523809526
