8615079,5,B00FEZXIYQ,"This movie was hilarious, beautiful, tragic and wonderful. It's a movie about dreams and moving forward along with feelings of inertia. It's definitely a unique film and it hits on different emotions throughout the movie. It's a genuine love story that you can identify with. The actors and cinematography were also great. I highly recommend that anyone watches this movie. I think it's the sort of movie to effect everyone differently, but in an incredibly positive way.",1426032000,,471,5.12987012987013

8615081,4,B00FEZXIYQ,"This movie was a pleasant surprise about urban life through the eyes of a young couple who love each other, but also love to smoke pot.  The story gets complicated when their self-created paradise is infiltrated by an outsider with possibly ill intentions.  Our couple splits and our hero is forced to do some serious soul searching.  The trip (no pun intended) is a fun one and I would suggest this movie for lovers who partake together.",1388361600,,438,4.662337662337662

In the wake of Ryan Cooglers Fruitvale Station and Lee Daniels The Butler and Alexandre Moors Blue Caprice and Andrew Dosumnus Mother of George, the hype about 2013 as the year of Black Cinema  and independent-minded, free-spirited and wide-ranging black cinema, at that  isn't hype anymore. And that brings us to writer-director Shaka Kings Brooklyn-made labor of love Newlyweeds, which is  wait, what was I saying? And where am I? Oh, thats right: weed. Im not saying that lots of people who went to see this indie comedy breakthrough over the weekend in New York and L.A., where its already playing, showed up stoned. And Im not saying they didnt. Im saying that King has fearlessly forged into unexplored territory  that being the African-American stoner comedy, with an adult audience in view  and the results are profoundly hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, often brilliant and entirely devoid of political piety.

Newlyweeds has a tremendous cast overall, including small parts for the ace character actors Isiah Whitlock Jr. (as a jailhouse predator in a purple suit, lamenting the cracker propensity for smoking weed mixed with tobacco), Anthony Chisholm (as a steel-spined middle-class dad) and Hassan Johnson (as a straight-shooting, good-hearted drug dealer named Two for Three). Colman Domingo, who had small parts in both Lincoln and The Butler, nearly steals the whole movie in a supporting role as a pretentious, fashion-plate museum curator with a jet-set demeanor and a stash of Mongolian hashish. (His character puts me in mind of that Chris Rock line about the African-American arts community of Brooklyn: I never knew black people could be snotty.) But its hard to overpraise the central couple in Newlyweeds, especially the wonderful Amari Cheatom as Lyle, the laconic repo man, committed pothead and utopian dreamer at the heart of Kings tale. Cheatom was seen briefly early in Django Unchained, but this is his first major big-screen performance and it won't be the last.

Lyle sometimes imagines himself (when excessively burnt) as half of a badass, mid-70s crime-fighting salt-and-pepper duo, but he might have more in common with Stan Laurel than with John Shaft. He spends his days driving around Brooklyn with tattooed hothead Jackie (Tone Tank, also very funny) repossessing poor peoples rent-to-own furniture  truth be told, sometimes the wrong peoples furniture, because hes so baked. Nights he spends smoking more of Two for Threes powerful ganja with the beautiful Nina (Trae Harris), a bit more of a middle-class striver type who has traveled around the world and leads educational workshops for groups of healthy-looking multicultural children. Or at least she does until that unfortunate episode at the Brooklyn Childrens Museum involving an entire tray of brownies.

Lyle and Nina both wind up spending nights in jail, in separate incidents, and one could say that while King never explicitly makes the point that pot laws are enforced selectively on racial grounds, that subtext is always present. Lyle also gets punched in the nose by an irate rent-to-own customer, befuddled and terrorized by an old lady, disrespected by a teenage drug dealer (who assumes hes a cop), sexually harassed in jail and out-wrestled by Ninas dad. Then theres the episode, after Jackie lures Lyle back into drinking, when he wakes up under a bench on a moving subway train, with his keys inside a plastic bag attached to his ankle and his arms pinioned inside a pink, child-size parka. I hate it when that happens. Cheatom plays all of this with a stone-faced, almost tragic resignation reminiscent of Buster Keaton. It gets funnier and funnier, and then rather suddenly it isn't funny anymore. I literally laughed until I cried, and then I was crying.

Lets be clear about the fact that King is not making some kind of anti-pot manifesto. Lyle and Nina are deep and habitual users of marijuana, to a degree that empties out their loving relationship, drains their financial resources and dries up their interest in other activities. But its not like they kill anybody or stick up liquor stores, and they probably don't do any harm to themselves that cant be undone with enough time. Its clear in the film that Lyle really starts sliding downhill once hes back on the bottle. This is a sophisticated comedy made for grown-ups, but King doesnt have a policy prescription when it comes to weed any more than the Harold and Kumar movies do: Smoking pot is really fun, and people who do it too much can do some stupid things. But within that banal observation lies an entire world of observation, a smoky, jazzy, biting and heartfelt comedy about two young people, one love affair, American life, African-American life, Brooklyn and  oh, yeah  weed.",1386374400,6,4840,5.095959595959596
