632898,5,6303342043,"Before he directed some of my favorite films (Heat, The Insider, Manhunter), Michael Mann created two groundbreaking television series.  Miami Vice got most of the viewers but its Crime Story that was truly ahead of its time.  Crime Story dealt with Lt. Torello (played by Dennis Farina with a grimness that always allowed a sly wit to shine through) who fought organized crime on the streets of Chicago in the 1950's.  His main nemesis is aspiring mobster Luca, himself a fascinating portrait of evil who somehow always managed to be somehow sympathetic in his raw need to be a true crime lord.  Even while playing hommage to the crime shows of the past (I always thought of it as the Untouchables if Eliot Ness ended up having a nervous breakdown halfway through the series), Crime Story redefined the genre.  It went over the head of most viewers but now, after films like Pulp Fiction changed the way we view entertainment, Crime Story has been rediscovered and its about time.  Even as the show's talented cast of character actors dispensed the melodrama with a sly wink at the few members of the audience lucky enough to be in on the joke, the violence was often amazingly intense but never played for cheap thrills.  As well, Crime Story had a simply amazing soundtrack.  In fact, I first started watching it mostly to hear the wonderful rendition of Del Shannon's ""Runaway"" over the opening credits but each show was scored with some of the best blues I've ever heard and it created a moody atmosphere that, quite simply, sucked you in.  If you're a fan of the crime genre but haven't seen Crime Story, do yourself a favor and track it down.  This pilot film is a great place to start on what, I promise, will be one of the most entertaining rides of your life.",1002585600,9,1769,4.623003194888179
632899,5,6303342043,Absolutely the best crime show ever. I watched the series in highschool and regret not taping it at the time.  I've also been searching for a copy of Runaway (the show's theme song - not Del's original version).  Can anyone help?,979430400,5,229,4.560975609756097
632900,4,6303342043,"As with the other folks above, I remember watching Crime Story each week during it's two years on the air.  It made TV bearable for a little while; remember, this show came in the days of such ""classics"" as Who's the Boss and The A-Team.  The last couple of episodes of season one blew me away; a story arc that lasted a season with all the loose ends being tied up in an finale that was definitely unconventional.
I own the boxed VHS set from Starmaker.  Although it is nice to have the entire run in one collection, the picture quality leaves something to be desired.  Also, it is nearing the end of it's shelf life (the average for VHS is about 15 years) so a DVD set would be very welcome.
Thanks to Anchor Bay for taking the time to put this gem back on the market and here's hoping they release the rest of the series.",967852800,12,824,4.19620253164557
632901,4,6303342043,"OK I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD, but I must tell you I have nothing but fond memories of one of the great TV shows of the 80's.
The  Pilot (which oddly I just rented about 4 months ago) serves both as a stand  alone crime drama, but also as an amazing spring board that does truly  leave you wanting for more. With Dennis Farina in one of his early roles  (same year as the GREAT Manhunter, and well before he became first a repeat  of himself in the early 90's then found the perfect roles for himself in  Get Shorty and Out of Sight) nailing the Lead Detective role to a T, David  Caruso pre-King of New York and providing a hint of what would make him a  good T.V. Star, and A.J. Denison providing one of the great TV badguys of  the 80's (along with the vilians from ""WiseGuy"") and last but not  least the great Able Ferrara, delivering a plot driven story that worked in  a medium (tv) that was much tamer than his later explorations into crime  (King of NY and Bad Lieutenant)yet delivered intensity that (for better or  worse) leaves the viewer wishing that Michael Mann's incredibly stylish tv  series (and CERTAINLY the better of his two tv efforts of the 80's, Miami  Vice of course being the other) finds more of its episodes re-released  soon.",966470400,3,1269,4.358974358974359
632902,5,6303342043,"This series was one of the best ever on television.  It made you want to be living in that era and be a cop going after the ""bad guys"".  The inclusion of the blues songs throughout each episode helped with  setting the correct moods of the moment.  Torello (Dennis Farina) could be  sitting at the bar with an early Stones or Muddy Waters song on the jukebox  and you could read his mind!  Michael Mann's best work, even better than  Miami Vice.",965952000,2,445,4.341463414634147
632903,5,6303342043,"When I saw the pilot, I couldn't wait for the series to begin. This is crime fighting at its best. Every character was interesting and the writing was superb! My only regret is that I didn't have the VCR on  ""record"" for the entire series. If anyone does or knows where I  can get complete copies of the series on tape, write me back at  humbert@midusa.net",953683200,,356,4.363636363636363
632904,4,6303342043,"From the chase up Lake Shore Drive in dueling '59 Ford squad cars, to the heat of Lt. Torello's stuffy office, this is one mesmerizing movie. The music, clothes, dialogue, action - everything comes together to present a  wacked-out look at the greasers in the Chicago Outfit in the early 1960's  and the good guys in black suits and thin ties who chased them.",925689600,5,359,4.59375

7844800,5,6303342043,"I loved this movie when I first saw it on TV many years ago. Tried to get it on tape and could never find it; nor on a DVD when they came out. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon and quickly grabbed it up. Well made DVD is very clear and has good color. Back when I was not aware that this was a pilot movie for the series that followed this. When I realized that there was going to be more of this, I was very happy. I really liked Dennis Farina. All you ""Crime Story"" fans will love this - can watch the movie by itself without having to wear out one area on the DVD with the series on it.",1408752000,,596,3.738095238095238
7844801,5,6303342043,"You don't want to watch the rest of the episodes after this climactic one... Stop here and savor the completeness of the story arc. Like pretending there was only one ""The Matrix"" movie.  What comes after Luca's arrest in his own club is all down-hill and unimportant. THIS is the high note in a marvelous series.",1404432000,,313,4.589285714285714
7844802,1,6303342043,"Don't be fooled by these other reviews.  I've bought the DVD sets, all of the CRIME STORY series, and the quality is terrible, practically a blurred picture, not really worth the purchase price. I was awefully disappointed and never watched more than the first show on the first disc.  And I see these used sellers are charging four times the original price.  Don't do it.  Don't be ripped off. The quality is worse than your memories of the show.",1237334400,2,447,4.620253164556962
7844803,5,6303342043,"I love Crime Story. I grew up watching it as a kid and I'am glad I finally found it at Amazon. This pilot movie rock and rolls.  Really gets you in the mood to watch the series coming out November 4, 2003.",1067299200,3,205,3.880952380952381
7844804,4,6303342043,"Crime Story is a a lean, mean cop show drama that features politically incorrect police officers battling it out with nasty criminals.
It's a testimony to Michael Mann's reputation at the time that Crime Story was even greenlighted. NBC would have never gone for the casting of Dennis Farina, with his pockmarked face and lack of acting experience, had Mann been a neophyte producer with no proven track record. The choice of cult film director Abel Ferrara (pre-Bad Lieutenant) must have also freaked out network execs. His previous films included a deranged psycho gruesomely killing people with a power tool and a rape survivor viciously killing the men who attacked her with a .45 pistol.
And yet, the final product proves that Mann's instincts were right on the money. Farina delivers the hard-boiled dialogue with the perfect amount of intensity (at one point Farina says menacingly to one goon, ""you hurt anybody else, when this is all over I'm gonna find what you love the most and I'm gonna kill it. Your mother, your father, your dog. Don't matter what it is -- it's dead.""). You can see it in his eyes and the way he barks out orders that this a no-nonsense guy who isn't going to let anything get in the way of his job.
Ferrara directs with the same proficient skill of crime auteur, Don Siegel. Crime Story depicts a harsh world where life is cheap and characters will do anything -- even if it means bending or breaking the law -- to achieve their goals.
One of the most striking aspects about Crime Story is that it feels like it was ripped right from the pages of a James Ellroy novel. It is even more surprising that this show was done before Ellroy had written his famous L.A. Quartet of books that features L.A. Confidential, which Crime Story most closely resembles. The author claims that he hadn't seen the show until after he wrote these novels but he does admit to being a fan since then. This, of course, begs the question, when is someone going to reunite Farina and Ferrara to do a proper Ellroy adaptation?
The DVD disappoints in the extras department. No audio commentaries from Ferrara or Mann (both of whom have done them before), or even the show's creator, Chuck Adamson. A retrospective featurette would have been nice but instead we are left with nothing.
If you are willing to overlook the appalling lack of extras and are a fan of Michael Mann or James Ellroy's fiction then this is definitely worth checking out. Hopefully, the folks at Anchor Bay will redeem themselves with the first season of Crime Story that their website says is due out in July of this year with the second season coming out in December.",1057622400,6,2648,4.660256410256411
7844805,5,6303342043,"Oh my Gawd!!  I had no idea this was on DVD!!  This was one of the best TV shows of the '80s and deserved a longer life.  If you're thinking of getting it do not hesitate.  Get it.  You won't regret it.  Now, if we could just PLEASE get ABC's 1991 drama ""Homefront"" on video life would be just about perfect.  :)",1051056000,,312,3.935483870967742
7844806,5,6303342043,"It only took a couple of seconds to know that this was going to be great.  By the opening credits, I was hooked by the characters, the action, and the style.  (Speaking of the credits, it's too bad that the wonderful montage of stock footage from Chicago intercut with shots from the series was replaced with Torello and company ""in formation."")  It leaves Miami Vice in the dust.  Allow me to add my voice to those above in urging whoever owns the rights to this gem to get both seasons on DVD as soon as possible.  It's a keeper.",1015891200,4,531,4.3232323232323235
7844807,4,6303342043,"While I am a transplant to Chicaga (the way the locals say it) the 'real' feel of the locations seep into this video.  The main characters of Ray Luca and Mike Torello join in a pas de deux of crime and justice.  Luca is amoral, staying strictly focused on making money as easily as possible, while Torello is so squarely on the line between good and evil that when he walks, one foot lands on the good side and the other foot lands on the side of evil.  It is this conflict that generates and develops the characters.  Michael Mann has succeeded in adapting Film Noire to Color.  The pilot is a great lead in to the rest of the series, and was years ahead of the quality storylines of the Sopranos.  The only way it could be better was if the rest of the series was also on DVD.",1006819200,3,779,4.16
