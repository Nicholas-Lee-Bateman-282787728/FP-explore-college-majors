2256252,5,B00080ZFYS,"I became addicted to this show a couple of years back, when my employer had me living out of a hotel room for month. After a 14-hour workday, I'd get back to the room mentally drained. While flipping channels to fall asleep, I happened upon this irreverent little cartoon show that was as hillarious anything I'd seen since the early days of The Simpsons, or the comedy of Jake Johansen.

The smart silliness of this animated show was, for me, the perfect antidote to fried-brain syndrome; and needless to say, I became hooked. Only thing is, I've never had cable at home; so when I got back, I went through withdrawls from no longer being able to see the show every night. FINALLY, I spotted the Home Movies: Season 1 box set at Tower Records and immediately had to get it. And I'm so hyped to know that the second season is about to be realesed!

On days when I come home for lunch, I end up watching Home Movies for an hour--it's way better than Judge Judy--and return to work ready to serve out the rest of the day with a grin on my face. I can't wait to own 13 more episodes of this great show.",1115510400,10,1099,4.278846153846154
2256253,5,B00080ZFYS,"To me it has always been a breech of decorum to review something on Amazon before it has actually been released but to me, ""Home Movies"" Season 2 is an exception from where I stand. I've seen the second season of Home Movies many more times than I can count.

Adult Swim (for those who don't or can't tune in) can be considered the home of ""cutting edge"" (though cheaply animated), gutsy, adult oriented animated programming. That's what they, and anyone with low enough standards thinks. What the block really consists of is exhaustively rerun cartoons and every half year something new--- which they will rerun until you can spout out any line of any show on demand.

These days, I change the channel until it's time for Home Movies. I've seen the other programs worth watching on the block a hundred times squared anyway, and Home Movies has always been the one gem to consistently make me laugh, even though I know every line from every show thanks to Adult Swim's lack of up-to-date programming. I can't explain it.

The first season DVD was great, simply because the show is. They could leave the commentaries, Brendon Small's attempts to display his below average musical ability, and the cast's attempts to convince us that they have careers away from Home Movies off the DVD and we'll still have a 5-star boxed set to add to our growing collection.

They did us all a favor and switched from Squigglevision to Flash Animation. The colors are brighter, movements more fluid and the lines hold still, thank God. The shows are less improvised and more scripted, and after hearing Loren Bouchard explain how episodes were recorded in the first boxed set: hours and hours of Jon Benjamin and Brendon Small goofing around, improvising dialogue and then editing the choicest stuff into the episode was probably a huge waste of time and money. One can certainly understand scripting the episodes, and letting the actors go from there and it never once changed the overall feel of the show at the core.

My favorite episodes of Season Two are ""Therapy"", ""Class Trip"" and especially ""The Wedding"" (""I am Elfor, The Landstander! I stand on land!""). The show has so many great moments that choosing a favorite is harder than it looks.

I was happy to read that Melissa Galsky is joining the cast on the commentary track. I missed hearing her cute voice on the first season commentary. It seemed incomplete to have Brendon and Jason on the track, but no Melissa. I am keeping my fingers crossed that they offer more to us than just a goof-off session on the commentary tracks. I hope to learn something about the process, but if I don't I'll still enjoy this.

The show stands by itself, and with or without DVD extras this set is worth the price. I imagine they put extras there just so people wouldn't shell out their money and complain about how the dvd had no extras. I personally could care less about dvd extras, though I harbor some hope that Soup 2 Nuts learned from the mistakes of the last boxed set.

Many thanks to Soup 2 Nuts for continuing to release Home Movies on DVD, and I hope to see the rest of the show on DVD all the way to the very last episode. I'd hate to have to keep tuning to Adult Swim at 2AM to get my ""Home Movies"" fix. Their new shows, such as ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" and ""Robot Chicken"" are so painfully un-funny and difficult to sit through (even for 15 minutes) that I end up watch reruns of South Park or Chapelle's show. The new stuff Adult Swim Sunday offers aren't fit for streaming video, let alone a slot on a TV network, but I guess there's no school like the old school.

Many thanks for reading my worthless opinion and I hope it helped a little bit.",1113782400,73,3690,4.536842105263158
2256254,5,B00080ZFYS,"I was hoping they would release more than just Season One of this magnificent show. I could not sleep one night and by chance saw one episode from the first season. I was crying from laughing so hard. I immediately went out and bought the DVD's and have enjoyed them ever since. Admittedly I have not seen any episodes other than season one but what makes this show is the writing and I can't imagine that much of a downfall. Some of my favorite scenes from Season One....

The camping scene from ""Yoko""---- Eugene ""I peed in Coach Mcguirk's canteen.""  ""Tastes like pee turkey.""

Mcguirk is living with Melissa and Erik and he tries the yoga. Ok, it's immature but the fart jokes still crack me up.

My favorite, Jason, ""What question would you like to 'axe' me?""

I tend to like beautiful and artistic animations (with a hidden sweet spot for sat. morning retro cartoons ), but it's just so funny, and then I got it the child like hand drawn look is a style. A style that drives home (ha ha) the home made theme that is the entire point. My slowness aside there are tons of voices and animators that you will recognize and the level of talent that this project garnered is impressive that although I'm a die hard GUIN SAGA kind of gal, it turned me into a Home Movies fan as well!",1392854400,,561,4.155963302752293

2256285,5,B00080ZFYS,"One of my favorite shows ever made.

A very unique and ""left of field"" comedy, I highly recommend it for anyone who aspired to become a film maker. It is not a kids show, but it isn't offensive either, just obscure, in a really funny way.

Very heartwarming, oddball and all round genius comedy. Brendon Small's best creation. Coach McGuirk is a standout here.",1334448000,,360,4.609375

2256288,5,B00080ZFYS,"This season has so many great episodes with that classic Home Movies style of humor, that anyone who loved the first season would have no reason not to love this one too.

Yes, the animation doesn't ""squiggle"" anymore but this shouldn't concern anyone thinking about purchasing as it doesn't detract from the show at all.",1204243200,,321,4.836363636363636
2256289,5,B00080ZFYS,"Home Movies has to be one of the funniest cartoons ever done for American TV. I really miss this show, and I wish it had achieved a larger audience.",1162252800,2,148,4.137931034482759
2256290,5,B00080ZFYS,"This has got to be my favorite season of home movies. For those of you who have never heard of it, Home Movies was an adult oriented cartoon airing occasionally on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. I know how hard it is to see this show, usually it'd only be on, on Sunday nights at like 12:30am or something. This is why owning these dvd's is SO important. The animation isn't the best, its got a rough around the edges quality, but I think it just makes the show more loveable. The main story line is about a boy named Brandon and his friends who direct and star in their own ""home movies"". The second season is just as hilarious as the first. I fell in love with this show the first time I saw it (oddly enough a season 2 episode) and I hope you do too.

I know I could have used this when I was purchasing the first season, but if anyone is looking for the particular episode in which the coach inherits a sausage, this is the season!!! =D Priceless, my favorite home movies moment!",1128297600,3,982,4.223404255319149
2256291,2,B00080ZFYS,"I should start by saying that I love this show, and missed it tremendously when Adult Swim moved it to the middle of the night to accommodate their absurd new original programming.  In the wake of the Family Guy's DVD success I even wrote Scholastica begging them to release HM on DVD.

I pre-ordered Season 1 from Amazon at the earliest available opportunity and have watched it many times since.  (""It is practically joke!"")  I always harbored some secret, unjustified sense of superiority that I fell in love with this witty, subtle show when everyone else was watching Everybody Loves Raymond.  It was as if I ""got"" something that others didn't, and great was my reward.

But Season 2, I just don't get.  Maybe I'm missing something, and maybe my viewings haven't been sufficiently repeated.  The animation is admittedly improved, though squigglevision didn't bother me that much in the first Season.

My biggest problem is that the Season 2 episodes are just not as funny, or creative.  Am I the only one who feels like most of these storylines just fall flat?  Walter & Perry are delightfully absurd, but Paula's boss is just excrutiating.  A Woody Allen character, but obnoxious?  Who thought this would be funny?  The interactions between Brendan and his Dad are nice, and light, but all of the girlfriend scenes are just uncomfortable.  If I want uncomfortable, I can watch Fargo.  I don't laugh nearly as much during Season 2.  That's a problem.

Just as importantly, there aren't nearly enough ""Home Movies""!  Their number is significantly reduced, replaced by mammoth, episode-filling epics that don't stay funny long enough.

This is all just my opinion, of course.  But reading the other reviews, I see all these people gushing about HM--understandably--but almost no one talking about how they can't live without Season 2.  By contrast, I need to watch Season 1's ""Loni"" at least once a week, following closely by Casablanca.

Take all this for what it's worth.  And if you'll excuse me, I've got to go pre-order Season 3 sight unseen.",1128038400,9,2050,4.909620991253644
2256292,4,B00080ZFYS,"First of all it has to be said, ""Season two"" is not better than ""Season One"". OK. Now that we got that out the way let it be said ""Home Movies"" still represents in ""Season two"". The show is just plain funny, with a solid mix of comedy and light hearted drama, that will keep you coming back for more. New characters such as the Walter & Perry, the mulitied-rolled spanish guy/kid, really round out an already allstar cast of characters. 4 stars. Only show better than ""Home Movies"" is ""Dr. Katz"" and good luck getting your hands on that!",1125100800,,537,4.38
2256293,5,B00080ZFYS,"Ok, I'll be honest with anyone who's interested in the Home Movies series 2 collection. It's a shade different than season 1.

Be prepared for a few changes, most of which ARE good. I loved season 1, and when I read the reviews about season 2 being different, I didn't like the idea too much. I went ahead and got it and at first, I almost missed the Squigglevision! (I'm probably the only one!) One more thing- the dialoug is a little more stylized, and it takes a minute to get used to it. However, put that aside and season 2 is hilarious! The more I watched it the more it grew on me! I love it now, and wouldn't change anything about it. I'm not gonna talk about any episodes in particular because I don't wanna ruin the surprises, but it's great. This is one case where change is a good thing.",1123027200,2,799,4.222222222222222
2256294,5,B00080ZFYS,"When some friends got me into Adult Swim, I enjoyed it at first but largely tired of the silly, but sometimes too stupid and/or random to even be funny shows that populated the majority of the block. Except Home Movies. Home Movies became the only show that I regularly tuned in to, and when I discovered it was cancelled I scoured the internet in hopes that they'd put it out on DVD. Lo and behold, someone made the call and let us watch this great show whenever we want.

What holds Home Movies above the rest of Adult Swim is that the series is very character driven, and the characters and situations are very real. The show is able to take situations like a kid growing up in a single-parent household and simultaneously approach from a child's perpsective and an adult one. I think that if Home Movies had been a live-action sit-com it would've gotten a lot more respect for being the brilliantly funny and insightful show that it is.

The show is as always subtly hilarious, and what's better is that some of the commentaries are like getting a whole new episode. While I do miss hearing H. Jon Benjamin on the tracks, Brendon, Loren and Melissa have got more than enough clever and interesting commentary to keepthe commentaries fresh. The interviews are quite funny as well.

What more can I say? The show is superb and season 2 is even better than the first one. It deserves a spot in any TV fan's collection.",1121990400,2,1419,4.5136186770428015
2256295,5,B00080ZFYS,"""Home Movies"" is the best of all Adult Swim shows, and when it was cancelled Cartoon Network instantly lost a large percentage of their more intelligent viewers. The show has the ability to amuse with subtlety better than any other cartoon I have ever seen, and this season is one of the finest. For season two the show changed from Squigglevision to Flash animation, largely for the better. Simultaneously the characters began to develop into more complete entities, yet remain complex and flexible enough to handle many diverse situations.

Of the episodes in season two, I particularly like ""Hiatus"" (the ""jazz fight"" is just wonderful), ""Identifying a Body"" (which has one of the strangest plotlines ever in a cartoon), ""Pizza Club"" (which features a wonderful scene of Walter and Perry going on about their inability to eat pizza due to lactose intolerance and spastic colon), and ""The Wedding,"" which is perhaps the funniest episode in the set, once again featuring lots of subtlety (the floral arrangements, the rash, and the new minister [""I haven't done this recently...or in the past...""] all come to mind), and perhaps the best exchange of all time from Walter and Perry.

There are many excellent commentary tracks and extras, which fans will definitely appreciate.

I can't recommend this set or this series highly enough. Do yourself a favor and check it out: I can't imagine not loving this show!",1119744000,22,1411,5.021367521367521

This show is the sole reason that i got into Adult Swim, and now im a regular watcher, except for the anime crap. I would like to see more Home Movies on Adult Swim and especially new seasons of it, but Aqua Teen Hunger Force pulls its weight easily.

My hope for this set:  That they mixed the commentaries properly, so the episode audio doesn't interfere with the commentary hijinks.  I would love to be able to hear the commentaries without getting an extreme headache.

Brendan Small is a . . . GENIUS (musical and comedic) . . . and H. Jon Benjamin may be the only performer who can steal the show from him!  Janine DiIlulio is admirable for IMPROVING on Paula Poundstone's role (and lending the character sex appeal), and Melissa Bardin Garsky is a witty foil.  Not to mention the great guest performers, and semi-regular Jonathan Katz.  It's really amazing:  ""HOME MOVIES"" is OVERLOADED with TALENT!  No, seriously . . .

8055193,5,B00080ZFYS,"The epic second season of possibly my favorite series of all time. This season is where HM really tried the story arc format,  which is something that really sets it apart from other seasons. There is allot going on in this season, including Brendon trying to win the heart of his crush,  Cynthia,  who I believe is one of the two major love interest he gets in the series,  (First being Loni from season 1) the season  also centers around Brendon trying to spend more time with his father,  while having a hard time getting used to his new attractive wife,  with a sassy and bitter personality,  Linda,  who is voiced by Laura Silverman, who does excellent voice work here.

Some great episodes here include,  ""The Party "" where we see Jason in his candy-addicted rampage, ""Pizza Club "" which has some of Mcgurk's funniest moments,  ""Therapy"" which has great dialogue and timing from Brendon,  Andrew,  Linda and Mcgurk,  the legendary ""Starboy"" episode,  which I think features Brendon's best movie.

It's hard to decide if I love this or season 3 more,  as they're both almost as great. This season for sure helped boost HM from a little known show to the cult favorite it is now.",1526428800,,1183,4.632850241545894

8055202,5,B00080ZFYS,"I was fortunate enough to find the other three seasons at various resale stores (why would anyone give these away??), but needed Season Two to complete the series. It's actually my last favorite of the four (I blame Linda), but I feel like that's choosing your least favorite level in a video game you love to play. In the end the whole thing is great and worth your time and something you'll keep coming back to. (At least for the Starboy episodes and the finale.)",1443052800,,465,4.482352941176471
