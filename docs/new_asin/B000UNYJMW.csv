However this particular DVD would not play...got to the menu screen just fine but nothing would come up past that screen.  This review is being forwarded because of the poor service.  According to the Seller's policy one was given only a few days to return in order to get a full refund or replacement.  I assumed that the DVD would play okay but have learned to test any DVD right away upon receipt to make sure that it's okay.  Hopefully they'll be kind and replace it for I really would like to view it.",1340064000,,575,4.336448598130841

2923394,5,B000UNYJMW,"Legend Films presents ""ABBOTT & COSTELLO: FUNNIEST ROUTINES VOL. 2"" (1951-1954) (79 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- William (Bud) Abbott and Lou Costello (born Louis Francis Cristillo) performed together as Abbott and Costello, an American comedy duo whose work in radio, film and television made them the most popular comedy team during the 1940s --- Thanks to the endurance of their most popular and influential routine, ""Who's on First?""-- whose rapid-fire word play and comprehension confusion set the preponderant framework for most of their best-known routines--the team is, as a result, featured in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Universal signed them to a long-term contract, and their second film, Buck Privates, (1941) made them box-office stars --- In most of their films, the plot was a framework for the two comics to reintroduce comedy routines they first performed on stage --- Universal also added glitzy, gratuitous production numbers (a formula borrowed from the Marx Brothers comedies) featuring The Andrews Sisters, Ted Lewis and his Orchestra, and other musical acts --- They made 36 films together between 1940 and 1956 --- Abbott and Costello were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II --- Other film successes included Hold That Ghost, Who Done It?, Pardon My Sarong, The Time of Their Lives, Buck Privates Come Home, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.

In 1942, Abbott and Costello were the top box office draw with a reported take of $10 million --- They would remain a top ten box office attraction until 1952 --- In 1951, they moved to television as rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were among the others.) --- Each show was a live hour of vaudeville in front of a theater audience, revitalizing the comedians' performances and giving their old routines a new sparkle --- Contrary to popular belief, however, the duo was not inducted into the Hall -- (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

2923395,5,B000UNYJMW,"This is a great DVD of hilarious performances from Abbott and Costello. Put together with volume 1 in the ""Funniest Routines"" series, it makes a great addition to the ""Classic Comedy"" section of anyones DVD library. Great fun that the whole family can enjoy together.

These routines are presented in black and white. The only part of it that is in color are two bonus features. One of these is probably the most famous comedy routine of all time, ""Who's on First."" This is the first time that Who's on First has ever been presented in color, and to me, it makes it worth owning the DVD for. The rest of the routines are presented in black and white, and were clearly taken from a superior transfer than other collections I've seen: They look great!

Here is a list of the routines the disc includes:

-Getting down off a duck's back
-The Ice Cream bit
-Bryant-444
-Get out of the office
-The Handkerchief gag
-Higher and Lower
-Cotton in the Ears
-The Dancing Partner
-The Initiation

-Go ahead, play the music
-A figure of speech
-Crazy House
-Who's on First
and a bonus classic Jiffy Pop commercial

2923396,1,B000UNYJMW,"I looked forward to getting this Abbot & Costello DVD with great anticipation of sharing it with my children.  I especially looked forward to their ""Who's on First"" routine.  I was greatly disapointed.

Most of the material on the DVD comes from an early television program and was probably very funny at the time.  Taking it out of that context, however, leaves it less than amusing.

The greatest disappointment was the clip of ""Who's on First"".  Not only did they abridge the routine, it's done as an afterthought during a cameo appearance.  What you find on the internet is much better.

My recommendation - if you're looking for the real Abbott & Costello, don't look here.",1204243200,,678,4.7844827586206895

2923398,2,B000UNYJMW,"Well, I've been fooled again. I bought this DVD along with Vol. 2 of A&C Funniest expecting to get COLORIZED versions of the Colgate Comedy A&C comedy routines, instead all I got was b/w versions of their bits. The bits are good, for sure, but I expected to get COLOR versions, not the b/w drab versions. I am very disappointed, I wanted these in color. I was also fooled with another Legend release supposedly releasing 3 Stooges bits in color, instead only a tiny piece was colorized and the majority of the Stooge 3 disc set that I got was in it's original b/w. WHERE'S THE COLORIZATION??? What's with the misleading advertising leading you to believe you're about to see a beautifully colorized DVD set, when instead you get literally a couple of minutes of some material colorized but 99% of the DVD is b/w. I WANTED COLORIZATION, not b/w, I've been ripped off. Who do I clobber? Oh, myself for being fooled twice.",1195516800,,919,4.609756097560975

This is a great collection for any A&C ( Abbott & Costello) fan. This collection contains a compilation of full routines/skits (not episodes) from A&C's appearances on The Colgate Comedy Hour (nothing from The Abbott and Costello Show or any of their movies). When I ordered this I was a bit dissspointed knowing that these were not full episodes but since I did some looking around, I found no full season releases for The Colgate Comedy Hour. However, I did find a few DVDs with full A&C episodes but the number of episodes are few and Im always looking for something a bit more definitive and I personally think this collection is the closes you're going to get to that, least for Abbott & Costello on The Colgate Comedy Hour.",1507939200,2,875,4.579617834394904
