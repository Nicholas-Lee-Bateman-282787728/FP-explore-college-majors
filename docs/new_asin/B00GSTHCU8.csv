6109592,5,B00GSTHCU8,"I got a chance to preview this movie and what a wonderful mix of modern day military moves with a great twist of Christianity, defending freedoms and ultimate sacrifices.  Thank you to all who have served and for your current service to our country to protect its freedoms.",1387756800,9,273,4.6875

8627128,1,B00GSTHCU8,"I really wish I could enjoy a little this movie since there are no Christian war movies available so far. But I was not even able to finish. The pace is very very very slow, it has only one music in the soundttack (lots of slow dialog yes without music at all). Camera is allways in close zoom. The actors probably recorded their voice in a studio, often you can see their mouth speaking and the sound coming later ....In general... very low budget. They do not make you identify with the roles. The history had a huge potential but I was really disappointed.  I guess good movies such as THE END OF THE SPEAR, OCTOBER BABY, COURAGEOUS  and FAITH LIKE POTATOS spoiled me.",1420848000,,671,4.403225806451613
8627129,5,B00GSTHCU8,This is a meaningful story about two marines who were given the courage to choose death to save the lives of  others.  A very challenging story and well told...  jn,1399161600,2,164,4.4
8627130,4,B00GSTHCU8,Excellent movie to show middle school age kids. Low drama high content. There's no greater love then a friend who would lay down their life for someone else.,1398038400,3,157,4.642857142857143
8627131,1,B00GSTHCU8,"Not one of the worst movies, but the absolutely worst movie I have ever watched!  I have never seen such terrible acting in my life.  I'm sure they had good intentions in making a Christian movie, but this movie was awful from the beginning! Once you start watching it you feel guilty if you want to turn it off because it's supposed to be a Christian movie plus it has missionaries in it as well as the military.  Don't torture yourself with D acting, it never gets better but you are always hoping it will.  There are too many other Christian movies that are actually good!",1395964800,2,575,4.39622641509434
8627132,2,B00GSTHCU8,My husband was in the Army & this movie even bored him to death. He's an Iraq veteran. We didn't like it.,1395532800,,105,3.8181818181818183
