8470359,5,B005FO4UUM,"This is a good concert film of a great artist.  I just want to point out that while used copies here run for $99.99, there is another release of the same concert as ""Amy Winehouse - Live in Concert (2012)"" (B0087E669A), with copies for sale starting at ~$11.  I've purchased both, so I can attest to the fact that these are the same concert released with different packaging by the same label (Immortal).",1369785600,2,404,4.52054794520548
8470360,2,B005FO4UUM,"I like her music, but didn't really care for the concert.  Just personal preference I guess. I guess I'm just not a big fan.",1327190400,2,124,4.166666666666667
8470361,5,B005FO4UUM,All I can say is WOW!  Even drunk this woman performs magnificently.  This concert was no exception with her punk rocker attitude and jazzy voice she definitely was one of a kind.,1324598400,2,179,4.5625
8470362,5,B005FO4UUM,"This video recording of Amy performing live is amazing.  For a tiny woman who moves so little she certainly has the rhythm.  Her voice is incredible.  You get more of Amy's quirky wit in this video. Love it!!  I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of great music, especially jazz.",1323561600,2,290,4.415094339622642
8470363,5,B005FO4UUM,"Amy Winehouse's concert performances in 2007 are legendary. She is inspired, the band is tight, and she sings these songs as you've never heard them before. This is Amy Winehouse at her absolute brilliant best.
Buy it! You will not be disappointed.",1323302400,5,248,4.928571428571429
8470364,4,B005FO4UUM,"Losing Amy was a huge loss. Like many of her fans I've watched the dvd ""I Told You I Was Trouble"" many, many times and was waiting for something fresh to watch. There is certainly nothing wrong with this dvd--it's great but in my opinion not as good as ""Trouble."" This concert appears to be shot for tv whereas Trouble was for a dvd release. I will agree with another reviewer that Amy is probably more focused (sober) in this concert. Some of the songs (Wake Up Alone) are lacking in performance on this concert compared to Trouble--less backing vocals which contribute greatly to song for me. As for the musicians out there there are two guitars players on this one, a different drummer and (I think) one less horn player. Certainly a good 2nd official release but I'd go with Trouble first.",1320624000,13,793,4.5524475524475525
8470365,5,B005FO4UUM,"I have been a huge Amy Winehouse fan for the past 5 years, and her death still brings me to tears. When I saw that that there was a new live DVD of my Amy in concert, I was EXCITED. For the past 3 years all I've seen is her live in london dvd, or online clips and her live DVD's are usually for region 2. I will say that her vocals are incredible as always on this DVD, but mostly because she doesn't start to drink until half way through her gig. Though the concert is good, I feel such a distant between her and the crowd. She dosen't seem like her usual playful and talkative self and I was hoping that this gig would be similar to her Glastonbury gig in '07 (one of my favorite gig's of hers, watch it youtube!) but it just isn't. Don't get me wrong, I love to see Amy live anytime, but hopefully more DVD's will be released soon. RIP Winehouse.",1318982400,5,849,4.029585798816568
8470366,5,B005FO4UUM,"This girl covered music styles that go way back in time...but with a modern upbeat twist . She inspired me,touched me immensely. Buy this one to get a real look at Amy Winehouse. CAN all the news reports about her...see for yourself...the talent and true emotional content Amy put into every song.",1318982400,3,297,4.730769230769231
8470367,5,B005FO4UUM,"Winehouse is at the top of her vocal game in this one at the Eurockeennes festival, Belfort France 2007.  She is in excellent form and presentation.  I am so thankful this was finally released in NTSC format here in the US.  Winehouse's talent is positively undeniable and this DVD deserves five stars or better in my opinion.",1317427200,10,326,4.684210526315789
8470368,5,B005FO4UUM,"Having watched and loved Amy Winehouse's 2007 concert countless times on the ""I Told You I Was Trouble"" concert dvd, I was very curious to view this set from France when I heard that it was being released.  Here she is even better, in my estimation, probably because she was steadier and more sober during this performance.  She seems more at ease, more confident, and a bit more on her game.  Don't get me wrong, I love the other concert dvd, but in hindsight it is now more difficult and painful to watch, knowing what was to come, and seeing the beginning of her deterioration.  She really gives a wonderful performance in this concert, most likely due to the fact that she doesn't seem to need imbibing to get through her performance.

I think, from fragments I've seen of her in the studio, and in interviews on the first concert dvd, that Amy was basically a very insecure person, and her brashness and impetuousness was a smoke screen to hide behind.  It probably helped her to relax--to a point, obviously--to have a drink during her performances.  Her take no prisoners attitude was one of the things that endeared her to me--the vulnerability, cloaked in swagger and dagger, was a really interesting juxtaposition to witness, especially when she opened her mouth and that voice came out--pulling her soul out as it came, without any varnish.  She was one of a kind.  She was real.  In the plastic world of celebrity, she was such a breath of fresh air, in my opinion.  This dvd is a treasure for anyone who misses this lost soul.  She revived my passion for music back in 2007 when ""Back To Black"" was released, and it is astonishing to think that she made such an indelible mark on the music world with just two albums worth of material.  She was one of the greats.",1314403200,44,1776,4.564668769716088
