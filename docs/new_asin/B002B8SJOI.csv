3892967,5,B002B8SJOI,I lost 5 pounds in a month with this video. It's easy to follow and she explains the movements to a tee. You will see the difference and you won't be bored!!,1271203200,7,157,3.9375
3892968,5,B002B8SJOI,"If your looking for a no nonsense workout that will kick your butt into shape, this is your video. I love the way she cuts it up into 15 min. workouts that way if you have a little time you can do the 15 min. or it you have more time you can add more workouts.",1270252800,6,260,3.6607142857142856
3892969,5,B002B8SJOI,"I started feeling this workout right away.  It is nice to be able to create my own workout, depending upon my time each day.",1262822400,6,124,4.166666666666667
8360903,5,B002B8SJOI,Great DVD set with a nice variety of exercises that are quick but effective.  I like that I can customize my workout by doing one segment at a time or choosing two or three segments.  I also like Tamilee as an instructor and have several other work out videos by her.,1412121600,,267,4.215686274509804
8360904,3,B002B8SJOI,"I have never done a Tamilee workout but remembered a girl I went to highschool with way back when used her ""steele"" videos and was in great shape so I figured why not.  I decided to start my work out slow so only did the warm-up and thighs tonight.  The warm-up is quick which I like because I hate long cheezy warm-ups.  The thighs was a quick 15min workout which is nice for someone who has a tight schedule like me.  Tamilee moves fast when changing moves which can get confusing because it seems like she is going to demo but just keeps going.  I found myself rewinding a couple of times.  I think the more I do the workouts the easier it will become.  That said, the workout was good.  I did feel warm and my thighs were burning and felt weak when I was done.  I haven't tried any of the other workouts yet, but may leave an update on those and results.
UPDATE.... I have done the 2nd video which includes the buns and there is NO audio so I had to watch very close to see when moves were going to change.....kind of annoying. I also only felt the burn in my legs on the buns video so not sure if I'm not doing it right (since there is no audio) or if I will feel them in a couple of days. For this I would take a star away.",1395964800,,1229,4.004098360655738
8360905,5,B002B8SJOI,"My how I love Tammilee!

Wonderful workout. I love fitness and Tammilee keeps your energy up very entertaining and fun nice breakdowns during each transition I would recommend 100%. I have all of Tamilee DVD's and even when one of mind dics got scratched and didn't work any longer I hurries out brought a new one

Great results",1393718400,,328,4.637931034482759
8360906,5,B002B8SJOI,An extremely intense workout. Tamilee does not disappoint her fans. I'm younger than her & I wonder how she does it!,1359158400,2,116,4.571428571428571
8360907,5,B002B8SJOI,"Tamilee is the best fitness trainer on video and I have tried dozens!  I still work out with her programs from the 1990's, but these are new from her.  Made in 2009, the two DVD's contain six 15 minute work outs plus warm-ups which you can choose whether or not to do.  Normally I have found Tamilee easy to follow but in 15 short minutes she can't explain things too slowly so there are times when it's hard to stay in sync with her - nothing that a few viewings won't fix. It's great because you can mix and match routines and add another 15 minutes if you want to extend your work out.  Highly recommend!",1330992000,2,607,4.206896551724138
8360908,5,B002B8SJOI,I bought a couple of different Tamilee work outs and like all of them - used to do the Buns of Steel series back 20 years ago and these are just as good or better than the original.  Still my favorite instructor to work out with:-),1301270400,4,231,4.021739130434782
8360909,3,B002B8SJOI,"The DVD is fine, but the music is so loud, it's very hard to hear the explanations; if you turn the volume down, the music is still loud, and the voice is hardly heard. The explanations are far more important than the music in this video, so it's very irritating not to be able to exercise and understand at the same time what you are supposed to do.",1296086400,3,350,4.161764705882353
8360910,5,B002B8SJOI,She gives a great workout!!,1295308800,,27,4.6
8360911,1,B002B8SJOI,I didn't care for these.  Seems like there were off the wall moves/exercises and it didn't motivate me at all,1289088000,2,109,4.45
8360912,5,B002B8SJOI,"Love it, love it!  It is so much fun to work out with Tamilee.  Great exercises and easy to follow.
I see my arms getting toned after 2 weeks.  Highly recommend it!",1275350400,6,164,4.0625
