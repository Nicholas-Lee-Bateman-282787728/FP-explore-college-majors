5710844,5,B00CAYSKGU,"I'm a big Criminal Minds fan. I wish it was longer for the price, but I am extremely grateful to even have this available. It's right before It Takes a Village aired(season 7 premiere), so all of the questions are related to the premiere or season 7 in some way. If you're a big fan I would definitely suggest purchasing it. It's great to see them all interacting candidly. There are plenty of funny moments to enjoy. It does come on DVD-R, so it does play a little differently on my computer for some reason. No problems per say, but my controls on my media players don't work like normal with this dvd.

I'm really hoping some of the older ones become available, hint hint. ;)
Also, I ordered this on a Monday and received it on Thursday. Amazingly fast shipping.",1371772800,4,765,4.425531914893617

5710878,2,B00CAYSKGU,Too much of a rant about policy of network and recent character/casting changes. Did not finish it. Wanted to see more of cast and their roles.,1403568000,2,143,4.538461538461538
5710879,5,B00CAYSKGU,"This panel consisted of the CM cast for season 7 and executive producer/show runner Erica Messer. I enjoyed listening to their panel. This took place about 2 1/2 years ago, right before season 7 premiered. The cast seemed to have a good time. I streamed mine from Amazon Instant Video, and it worked fine. I hope they do another one like this for season 10, provided they get renewed.",1393718400,,384,4.579710144927536
5710880,5,B00CAYSKGU,"Criminal Minds is the best series on TV today and for many years. The cast and creators are gifted and origional. The charactors are unique, likeable, good looking, and have developed into ""people"" you care about and want to know learn more about what makes them tick.

This series has the 'gift' to continue for many years to come. I the viewer look forward to each new case, the next sick twisted unsub which the BAU must: look and learn from each crime scene from each agents perspective then from this  'pool' of knowledge, determine what drives the unsub and solve the case.

With that said, DONT mess with a good thing, its the best of the best and needs no changes.  I love this series....",1389225600,7,696,4.5
5710881,5,B00CAYSKGU,I really loved it.  Criminal Minds is the greatest.  I love all of the people that play on this show.,1388793600,,101,4.0
5710882,4,B00CAYSKGU,"My brain:  The video quality is passable at best.  Lots of grainy footage, not to mention the framing of the camera sometimes cuts off some of the actors so you don't get to see everyone's reactions to what's being said.  Audio quality is a little bit better.  Although, I've watched it over 8 times already and still some of the words are hard to understand because they sound so garbled.  The length is a little disappointing, too, considering some of the other shows (i.e. Castle) have at least 15 more minutes of content.

My heart:  I absolutely loved this because it's essentially a family reunion for the cast and the fans.  Despite my comments above, I would definitely recommend this to longtime fans.

P.S.
I'm hoping Paley and Amazon release the first Criminal Minds at Paley as well.  Thanks!",1387497600,3,804,4.719424460431655
