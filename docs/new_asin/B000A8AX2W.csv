2380106,3,B000A8AX2W,"I was very excited to receive IMPACT in the mail from Netflix, but was disappointed in Miller's latest effort.  After such gems as COLD FUSION and STORM, this film didn't quite live up to the sequences of his previous films.

The Chamonix sequence was excellent, as was the sequence of snowboard jumping at Mammoth, but the film didn't have as much of Miller's dry humor or 1950s ski nostalgia, and I missed the obligatory base jump sequence, such as the spectacular winged suit jump from the top of the Eiger (in STORM, I believe).  The soundtrack was not as stellar and varied as before.  I simply was not as wowed as I was by his previous films.  I hope this year's HIGHER GROUND returns to his more exciting, better shot films.",1133740800,8,731,4.549618320610687
2380107,2,B000A8AX2W,"I bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through. Some chapters, I watch several more times.

This movie has three things against it. First, I was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie. It takes alot away from the whole movie. Second, it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released WM movie. Same people doing the same exact things. Third, the sound track was way below par.

I'm still a Warren Miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage. But, I don't think the WM bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie.",1130025600,5,642,4.254098360655738
2380108,5,B000A8AX2W,"I was lucky enough to catch a screening of Impact in Buffalo back in January and I must say it was incredible.  Not only was the cinematography good, the soundtrack was extremely strong.  From the opening shots of Cordova, Alaska, to the extreme steeps of Chamonix, France, Warren will keep you on the edge of your seat.

This DvD is definitely worth the buy just to watch it over and over again!",1123027200,6,396,4.472222222222222

8076386,5,B000A8AX2W,"I bought this DVD for my son but I love watching Warren Miller films and this one is no exception.  These skiers and riders are the tops, always daring and laughing at themselves.  Sure, their styles are over-the-top and self indulgent, maybe near suicidal in some cases but still these are highly skilled athletes in gorgeous winter settings.  commentary is always amusing if not predictable",1200873600,,392,5.0
8076387,4,B000A8AX2W,"Warren Miller has long been one of my faviorite photographer's and nairators.  Impact has his usual amounts of humor, and catchy lines.  However, Think i have been spoiled by his previous movie Journey.  Journey is the best of the warren miller movies to date in my opinion.  The music in impact was fairly bland.  Very Worth buying and adding to your collection by all means.  However i'd buy journey first.  As the line goes thou ""your worst day on the mountian, is still better than your best day at work.""  So any chance i get to watch skiing action in june is time well spent.

8076388,3,B000A8AX2W,"This was the ""last"" movie that Warren Miller was officially a part of. And if you seriously count him as a part of this movie it just barely counts. He sold his company to his son Kurt a few years ago and then his son turned around and sold the company to Time-Warner. Warren Miller hated the direction the new commercialized films were going and his contract with the company ended with this film- and him doing as little as possible to be a part of it.

If you see endless product placements, self-serving arrogant skiiers talking about themselves (instead of actually skiing), and a lack of the charm and humor of the old Warren Miller movies you'll know why-- they are being churned out annually by a large corporation only interested in the bottom line.

I went and saw ""Higher Ground"" in the theatres and it was even more of a disappointment than ""Impact"". It was the last Warren Miller movie I will see in the theatres. As a lifetime fan it was a sad day.

This movie is average at best. If you want to see some quality ski films that embody what skiiers really believe and not some corporation trying to sell sponsorships (granola bars, Jeeps and cell phones) check out Terminal Gravity Research (TGR) or Matchstick Productions.",1135036800,32,1236,4.583710407239819
