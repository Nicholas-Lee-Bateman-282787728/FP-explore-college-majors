8495038,4,B00692XELA,No Amy in the production but it really doesn't take away from the story line.  You get to see and hear some of the people she met and worked with along the way to top billing.  It give a good background to the whole development of the group.  I'm not exactly sure how the producers were able to snag Amy's dad for interview parts and not at least get Amy for a brief interview but it was highly likely due to her contract with her label.,1490400000,,437,4.058139534883721
8495039,1,B00692XELA,"I just put this in the shredder.  There is nothing useful or valuable about this ""documentary.""  Unless the word documentary means a series of interviews with her misogynistic, self-absorbed, snake of a father, and random others.  Such as a methamphetamine addict, a woman who is the ""editor"" of the newspaper, who can't manage to put a shirt on that actually goes around her girth, or some guy who works in a guitar store, qualifies as a documentary.

It was clear when I bought this that I was in for a less than stellar experience.  But this is an abomination.  Her father should be ashamed.  And I would imagine she is ashamed, not just for him, but ashamed by him.  I am ashamed of myself for being hoodwinked.",1448582400,,715,4.574803149606299

8495041,5,B00692XELA,"First, GREAT dvd! BUT! This has already been released under a different name 'After Midnight'. But it is a fun and awesome view of the band from a DIY (Do It Yourself) stand point.

I loved this watch. It's an AMAZING history and I loved all of the people whom they interviewed in it. They were each as cool to me as the band themselves are. Yes, it is unauthorized and unofficial. The band had nothing to do with this. But their friends and family did. Amy Lee's Father is one of the main interviewees across the entire documentary, and his stories of them (Amy Lee and Ben Moody) growing up in their house and writing and recording songs and early evanescence demos in the garage, for instance, (that's only 1 small piece) are really captivating.

The reason this is getting 5 Stars is because it is in fact a great music documentary, but be warned this documentary has already been released under a different name 'After Midnight'. Still, like I said, it is a great documentary and fascinating watch for any music lover out there. Being a musician myself, I get asked a lot 'What does it take to get recognized?' 'How did you start doing the things you are doing on a travelling level?' 'How do I get a record deal?'

These are all questions that are answered in the DVD to the degree of how it went for Evanescence. Part of success is luck but most of it is skill and dedication. This was one of the most passionate bands to come up in the late 90's and early 2000's and their story is one of honesty, excitement, and intrigue.

Considering all the interviews the producers were able to garner and how amazingly informative and intimate they all are, again, this is worth your $ (and you can get used copies for under $4 with shipping). These are all interviewees who knew the band VERY well. If you wanna get into the real history of Evanescence and also see a bit of how the local Little Rock, AK heavy metal/rock music scene was in the late 90's and early 2000's, you've picked a good item to look at. Due to copyright issues the producers were not able to use any of Evanescence's music as the soundtrack but the substitute soundtrack bands provide great background of the same genre, and, again, it's the interviews and stories all the people tell in this DVD that makes it what it is.

Lastly, if you already own the 'Evanescence: After Midnight' DVD, do not purchase this one as it is the SAME documentary, just under a new title. I own both (by both I mean both versions that have different DVD and CD label cover art) and they are one in the same.",1361491200,,2560,4.415254237288136
8495042,2,B00692XELA,"I too purchased this dvd thinking it was the real deal, only to find that dvd is not authorised by Evanescence nor by any party by whom they are represented., its not even Amy Lee voice in the songs that are played. I am a big fan and couldn't wait to watch dvd  but was very disappointed as soon as I pressed play.",1337040000,13,315,4.0
8495043,1,B00692XELA,"I found this product and thought that it was a new documentary movie on the band Evanescence since they released a new album last year and the title and description made it sound like it was a new documentary about the band, but I was sadly mistaken because when the movie arrived at my house I put it right into the DVD player I found out that the documentary was just an old documentary called After Midnight which came out about 6 years ago I believe and they are just trying to sell it in a new package, and a new title, but with no new information in the DVD at all.  Do not stop liking Evanescence, or their label, or anything associated with either of those two things because of this though because it says right on the DVD that Evanescence and their label have nothing to do with the making of this DVD",1334707200,11,811,4.232258064516129
