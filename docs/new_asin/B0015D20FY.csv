3143750,1,B0015D20FY,"This is the worst DVD I have ever seen. Boring, non-motivational and just blah. No wonder there has been a lot of negative press about Jackie Warner. Look at LA RAG MAG. I was just very disappointed! Don't waste your hard earned money on this one!",1211068800,12,247,4.391304347826087
3143751,5,B0015D20FY,"I picked this up based on the reviews that I read on Amazon and they were right - it's a great workout.  I haven't seen the Work Out series on Bravo, but I'd heard that it was good.  Jackie is the star of that program and I only wish now that I could see this.
This is a body targeted workout that uses interval training to get it done.  There are three programs and they each focus on different body parts; upper body, lower body and abs.  Each are fairly tough going but very effective.  I've done this twice already and I'm as sore the second time as the first.  I enjoy it though and have fun doing it which is the main thing because it's making me want to do it again.  All you need are some dumbells and some space and almost anyone can do it.  The combination of weights and cardio are what make it most effective and I feel like I can already feel some results.
Overall, this is a fun and enjoyable workout that makes you work hard and burn a lot of calories.  I love it.",1210982400,87,979,4.057291666666667

3143753,4,B0015D20FY,"I recently had twins and was on bedrest for 3.5 months during the pregnancy. Before I had the twins, I was a personal trainer and a D-1 athlete who was training for the olympic trials so I know what a good workout is. I had watched Jackie's show on tv before so when I saw the workouts on exercisetv I thought they would be great to try. They are great in length when you are trying to fit a quick workout in especially for a new mom with twins. I was sore from the legs workout for about three days the first time. The upper body workout didn't make me sore but I have been picking up two 10lb boys 24 hours a day for three months now plus their carseats. I just did the ab workout. I will find out tomorrow if I am sore. I love how the cardio is incorporated into the workout. I decided to buy the dvd because it is perfect for this time of my life now since I cant get to the gym. As well as it is getting me back into shape post=partum so I can try to qualify for the Olympic trials this June in the discus.",1209945600,9,1011,3.912621359223301
3143754,5,B0015D20FY,"I have been doing these workouts on Exercise TV and I am definitely getting this dvd when it comes out.  The workouts are short but effective.  I find I am mostly sore in the butt, back and core after doing all of these.
I burned 170 calories in 20 min doing the lower body portion.  I love all 3 workouts.  They all have some different moves in them and also spurts of cardio that help to burn lots of calories.  I would highly recommend.  Jackie is so much better than Jillian.  I would take Jackie over her any day.  I think if you do not watch the show Workout you will probably not really get Jackie's style or her relationships with the trainers.  I love the show and I love the workouts.  They are great!

Edit 6/7/08:  I burn between 450 and 500 cals doing all 3 workouts!  I have done all 3 about 15 times now and have seen a lot of definition in all areas.
I have increased my weights up from 3 pounds to 8 pounds on many of the exercises (biceps, chest etc) and I am finding the workout is easy for me now. I really hope she comes out with another one that is a step up from this one as far as difficulty goes but based on her show and what a pain it was to do this dvd I doubt she has another one planned *in the near future (like I wish) anyway).
Still HIGHLY recommend this dvd.  I LOVE it.",1209945600,26,1304,4.003875968992248
3143755,2,B0015D20FY,"I tried this dvd and it isn't very good.  Jackie tries to hard to be like Jillian MIchaels from the Biggest Loser, but she lacks all the caring that Jillian is famous for.  This is a pass.  If you are looking for an amazing workout 30 Day Shred by Jillian Michaels is the way to go.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-30-Day-Shred/dp/B00127RAJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred</a>",1209427200,3,458,6.125
3143756,5,B0015D20FY,"This is an excellent DVD with 3 circuit workouts (each 20 min long) that have a specific focus: Upper Body, Core, Lower Body. It features Jackie Warner with four of her trainers: Jesse, Rebecca, Augustina and Renessa. While the trainers all do the warmup and stretch together, during the weight training Jackie works out one-on-one with one of the individual trainers. She has them do the workout while she gives them pointers on form and motivation, except in the core workout where they all workout together. She is encouraging without being cheesy.

I really like this workout and felt it provided an adequate challenge for the intermediate and perhaps the beginner exerciser who really wants a challenge (as there are some modifications shown). There are some new and interesting moves as well as some old favorites, so you get a great amount of variety .  You do approximately one minute of each weight training exercise and for every 3-4 strength moves you do, there is also 1 minute of a cardio move. It moves at a fast pace but not so fast that you feel intimidated. You'll need light to moderate hand weights and a mat. Come on, you can do anything for a minute! :)

I will give an approximate breakdown of each workout, with the moves performed and the trainer who is actually doing the move while Jackie tells you how to do the move correctly and sometimes shows a modified version. Remember you do 1 minute of each move.

********** Upper Body Workout*********
You start out with a short warm-up with arm circles and boxer twist, then you get into the workout.

>Augustina
 -Bent Over Rows (back)
 -Rear Delt Fly (delts)
 - Cardio (30 sec each): Jumping Jacks & Ski Bunny
>Rebecca
 - Modified PushUp (Chest)
 - Kneeling Kickback (Triceps)
 - Lateral Raise & Front Raise (shoulders) - you alternate between one
  one arm doing the lateral raise and the other lifting to the front.
 - Cardio: Boxer Twist
>Renessa
 - Alternating One Arm Row (back)
 - Hammer Curl (biceps)
 - WV(basically a shoulder raise in a different position)
 - Transverse Fly (shoulders)
 - Cardio (Knee-to-Elbow)
> Jesse
 - Fly & Press (chest)
 - Skull Crusher (triceps)
 - Lateral Raise (shoulders)
 - Military Press (shoulders)
 - Cardio (Speed Bag)
Finally a much deserved cooldown with all the trainers.

********** Core Workout **********
 You start out with a brief workout including core rotations, squat with wood chop, overhead squat. In this workout they all workout together and Jackie mostly goes around and gives excellent form pointers but she does the moves sometimes, too. Renessa shows a modified beginner version of the move and Jesse sometimes shows an advanced version. You do each move for one minute. There are a few stretches interspersed throughout, because your abdominals will be sore.

- Crunches
- Clam (The soles of the feet are together with knees out, as you crunch)
- Plank (you hold it for one minute)
- Cardio: Mountain Climber & Plank Twist (30 sec of each)
- Bicycles
- Figure Eight (while sitting on the floor you lean back slightly and  alternately clap your hands under each leg)
- Side Plank Rotation (30 seconds on each side)
- Cardio: Torso Twist
- Straight Leg Tap
- Scissors
- Penguin Heel Tap (really targets the obliques)
- Cardio: Half Burpees
- V-sit Extend & Flex
- Side Roll
- Plank Variation
- Cardio: Fast Bicycles
Finally, a much deserved stretch.

********** Lower Body Workout *********
You start out with a warmup mainly using a half range of motion: little pulse squats, side lunge, front lunge, backward lunge. Again, you do each of the moves for 60 seconds, and hand weights can be used on most of the exercises.

>Augustina
 - Squat
 - Front Lunge
 - Box Squat
 - Cardio: Frog Hop & Shuffle (30 seconds each)
> Jesse
 - Plie Squat
 - Backward Lunge
 - Drop Step
 - Cardio: Jump Lunge Shuffle & Military KneeUp (30 seconds each)
> Renessa
 - Sumo Squat
 - Front Diagonal Lunges
 - Sumo Squat with Drop Step (the drop step is basically a curtsy squat)
 - Cardio: Knee Up Jog & Squat with Side Kick (30 seconds each)
> Rebecca (this part is done on the ground, so you'll probably need a mat)
 - Bridge
 - Reverse Scissor(lay on your stomach and kick your legs over each other)
 - Three Quarter Kick (similar to a Donkey Kick)- 60 seconds on each side
You finish off with a nice lower body and back stretch.

**********
Overall, you will definitely feel the burn and see results with this one. It is well worth the price and Jackie is a master trainer.",1208649600,451,4491,4.663694267515924
3143757,5,B0015D20FY,"I got to do a 25 minute preview workout from this video. I did the upper body portion. And let me tell ya I am not going to be able to move my arms tomorrow. This work out is not something I would recommend for beginners. It will definitely seem intimidating at first. But if you just do as many reps as you can then you will definitely be able to build up to keep up with Jackie and her trainers. Its a great workout. Jackies queuing is perfect and she gives lots of tips on keeping good form. All you need for this workout is a pair of light hand weights and you are good to go. Another workout similar to this one that will cause equal amounts of pain is the Jillian Michaels 30 day Shred.

The warm up, workout and the stretches for Upper Body, Lower Body & Core are perfect. You can choose to do all three sections or customize your workout. Each of the three sections are 20 minutes each. I was looking for something to get my heart rate up and build strength and this does both.

I also like the fact that I can choose what workout I would like to do that day; upper body, lower body or abs. It is set up so that I can alternate and work every part of my body when I need to. It is also not super long and boring. I actually got strong and then I looked forward to doing this workout.

I thought that since it is for ""stars"" it would be a lot more challenging than it was. I have 2 of her other workouts are they are very challenging and I like them a lot. For some reason I found it boring right from the start, not sure why. And what's just as bad or worse are the trainers in the video. The girls seem to be more into themselves and strutting their stuff than to motivate or show much energy. I realize that others really like this one, and I appreciate that...

3143788,5,B0015D20FY,"This is one of my all time favorite videos. Ive used this DVD for almost 5 years.
A complete whole body workout DVD that targets upper body, lower body and core. 20 minutes workout for each session. What I really like about Jackie is her crystal clear style of instruction. Absolutely no nonsense. Each session is mixed with a few short bursts of 1 minute cardio to keep your heart rate up.

You are fully aware of which muscle group you are working on as you follow her video. For me, I know that my upper body is my problem area so I pay extra attention to moves that give me the result I am looking for.

Another thing that makes Jackie stands out from other trainers is that she constantly reminds you the importance of posture. ""Watch your form"" is what Jackie said. ""Form matters"", good form, good results and no injuries. For all workout enthusiasts out there, we all know how poor postures during workout can cause unnecessary injuries. Jackie makes it her mission to keep you check your form throughout the entire routine.
This  workout is hard and yet effective. She has her trainers demonstrate two versions of workout (both high intensity and low intensity). You pick and choose the intensity level base on your energy and fitness needs. Jackie is very motivational and her trainers are so young & cute and vibrant.
Overall, an excellent full body workout DVD, worth every penny.  Good DVD, good result.",1406160000,,1415,4.648

Jackie does a great job explaining the exercises so you can follow along and I like that she shows an easy version and a hard version. *Note* She does actually do crunches.

3143793,5,B0015D20FY,My daughter recommended Jackie for abs workout without crunches. I ordered this DVD at the same time and like it a lot. Other reviewers covered everything very well. So I will just add my recommendation. I like the upper and lower body segments a lot. There are other core programs that I prefer but that does not diminish the value of those offered here. Someone mentioned they could do without the chit chat between Jackie and the trainers. I think she attempts to make this workout seem friendly and sociable and she does a good job.,1403049600,2,536,4.59375

Each exercise only lasts a minute and your on to something else which keeps its fun. There's a nice atmosphere, a well lit background, with happy exercisers to put you in a positive mood. While its tough and you feel burn and sweat, its not so hard thought it feels impossible. You adapt after around 3 weeks and can start increasing your weights.

3143798,2,B0015D20FY,The work out itself is OK. Moderately challenging. I really don't like the people in the video: they aren't dressed to work out and the women have their hair like magazine cover models (long and curled- gimme a break no one works out with glam hair) and they are all way over-acting. I just can't watch it. I have tons of exercise videos so I am used to the usual degree of over-enthusiasm that comes with a produced work out but in this video it is too much.,1397347200,2,459,4.2272727272727275

I'm one of those people who can't do just one video all the time and not start rolling my eyes at hearing the same corny joke over and over again and I like to shock my body with new routines. That being said this DVD is always in my rotation. Jackie is no non-sense, she makes sure you have all three options of beginner, intermediate and advanced and keeps it very do-able by making you do no set longer then 60 seconds. I also like that she tends to tell you what move is going to do what, so if you're killing yourself on a certain squat or press or crunch but then she tells you that's going to solve that certain problem area, it makes it a little easier to suffer through it and get there, at least for me.",1394496000,,755,4.04

It's awesome and I even use it after I've complete my other videos to finish with abs.  If there were anything I wish she'd change in her videos, it's that I wouldn't want her to stop to check form.

I also thought it was weird how the participants sit on balls in the background and watched each other do an exercise. It was just strange.

If the airbrushed abs were gone and all participated in exercise routines I would've given 5 stars. It was the airbrushing that brought it down. Did I say I was annoyed by the airbrushing.....",1375920000,2,494,4.53932584269663
3143824,4,B0015D20FY,"If you are the type of person who is willing to do any exercise for sixty seconds then this workout might impress you. This is a 60 minute workout broken down into three segments. You can do each 20 minute workout separately or put them all together which I did and loved it. You will be working upper body, lower body and core/abs. There are a lot of classic exercises like lunges and sit ups. However nothing gets boring as you only do each exercise for one minute.

The thing I felt most was the abdominal workout which was seriously intense. I had to push myself to get through it. However what I liked about this workout was that I could do nearly every exercise either in the advanced version or the modified version depending on how I was feeling. If you are feeling strong you can really go for it but even if you do the modifications you are still going to get a great workout and feel the burn.

This workout will make you sweat and will push you to your limits. The instructors are all pleasant and very fit. Jackie Warner of course leads the exercises but her instructors do most of the work.

3143826,5,B0015D20FY,"It's rare that I work out at home, but on the occasions where I can't get to the gym I will usually do some kind of weight training at home.  I have used a few other workout DVDs from other trainers, and always found something that annoyed me about them- either they were too scattered and hard to follow, or the intensity was not where I needed it to be.  This DVD is the only one that I have kept and continue to use constantly.  I bought it when it first came out and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  I figure I should review something that I have gotten so much use out of!  My husband will make fun of me because I literally just leave it in our DVD player for extended periods of time.

I love that each exercise is done for 60 seconds, and when Jackie says, ""you can do anything for a minute"", I agree and will push myself to finish!  It is very easy to follow along with because you are not doing any crazy dance moves or flailing around.  You're simply doing one exercise at a time, for one minute each.  It may seem regimented, but I find having that order to the workout helps me to get through it more easily!

The intensity is perfect.  I am in fairly good shape and go to the gym at least 5 days per week, and will still ache for a day or two after doing this DVD.

I love that you can break it up into different body areas- arms, legs, and abs- and either do one by itself or any combination of the three.  I also like that you can decide the order of the body areas that you would like to do the routine in.

Strength training really can change your body shape and is the best form of exercise to help you lose weight quickly, so if you are looking for an excellent workout that will help you to do these things, you should buy this now!",1374451200,4,1765,4.0344827586206895

3143835,3,B0015D20FY,"Pros:
-I like how it is broken down into upper/lower/abs, and the workouts are quick so maybe you went for a run that day and want to add something quick for upper body that isn't too hard. These workouts would be ok for that.
-The lower body was good, although to get any soreness you have to add fairly heavy dumbells, around 15lbs in each hand for me (moderately fit, moderately strong 38yoF). Lower body has 1 full minute for each exercise, which I feel is a good length of time to fatigue the muscle
-I like how she puts cardio into the workouts, which she does not do in Power Circuit Training (and I wish she would)

Cons:
-cheesy airbrushed abs on the trainers, cheesy costumes, low energy. Trainers are just sitting around when they could be doing the exercises in the background
-not really very intense. Upper body segment Jackie doesn't continue the exercises for a full minute, sometimes only 30 seconds, which isn't long enough for fatigue. I wish lower body segment was longer (though you can do it twice)
-sometimes Jackie's rhythm is too quick for people who are using heavier weights. She and her trainers use very light weights so they are always going really fast, yet Jackie continues to (rightly) assert that if you are not at fatigue then you should increase your weights. I actually find with Jillian that you get the opposite problem, the cadence is too slow. And it's harder to increase the weight with Jillian, because the videos are just way more intense.
-for the upper body workout, to make it effective I need a variety of weights ranging in 2lb increments from 5-12lbs, or I have to switch the plates on my bars and pause the video while I'm doing it -- which is annoying. I think I'd find it better if the exercises she chose were more balanced in terms of what is a reasonable weight to use for the various exercises.

I will probably add the lower body and maybe ab workouts to my routine but not the upper body. I have too many other ones that are better.",1368576000,3,1991,4.497237569060774

3143843,5,B0015D20FY,"I have a good physique (138 pds and 5ft7) and only want to lose the extra 10 pounds around my waist.  I don't like working out and i don't like the gym (people watching, doing nothing, and honestly I just want to be fit and lean and not bulky).  I wanted to start working out at home since i no longer want to pay for the $75 per hour for personal training 3x a week.  I love my personal trainer but i felt i reached a plateau and we were gossiping more than anything during my workout.

I looked at some of the Tracy Anderson videos online and i cannot believe she is heavily sponsored by Gwyneth Paltrow. She just seems like she makes the move as she goes along and she is sexualized with that Facebook ""Look at me"" attitude and some of her moves are just plain silly since even Cirque du Soleil contortionist don't come up with such Goop, and I cannot get past her skimpy outfit and plastic surgery!

So I purchased 3 Jillian Michaels DVD on Amazon since they were the most popular and recognized her name even though i never watched TBL.  I got the 30 Day Shred, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and the No More Trouble Zones. Well, i find her 3-2-1 interval system not what i was expecting.  First there's too much stress on the knee joints and i could feel them right away during the routine.  I tend to listen to my body and it was not feeling comfortable with many of the movements especially the cardio ones. And she talks way too much and can get annoying in the end.  I tried the other two DVDs and the same comments apply.

I decided my last try would be Jackie Warner.  I did not know who she was and was pleasantly surprised at how effective she was at cueing the reps and letting you know what and what not to do without constant chatting.  Of all the exercises in this video, there are maybe 6 i did not feel comfortable doing and just did either some other exercises i love doing or did the modification.

What i love about this workout is that it feels like straightforward no nonsense workout where you can modify or add intensity as you wish.  I feel I have a good workout without feeling or worrying about tear or injury (as she constantly reminds her viewers to - for instance- not let the knee bend past the toes).  I also like the fact that my energy level is up without feeling exhausted the next day.  So for me it's perfect.  I alternate this with the Xtreme abs workout since this is my trouble zone, and the power circuit training.  And they are the perfect combination.

The only con about Jackie for me is the 30 day shred workout DVD.  I did not like it since the pyramid method which consists of 55 ascending repetition is too much for what I am looking for and I just don't have as much fun as with this one and the Xtreme Abs DVD and power circuit.

To summarize: no nonsense straight forward informative exercises that can be easily modified to reduce or increase intensity.  It's a winner!",1365033600,,2921,4.291970802919708

Most work out dvd's bore me to tears, this one was engaging and fun, kept me on my toes and sweating.  If its not burning, its not working! LOVE THIS ONE!",1364774400,,322,3.8181818181818183
3143845,4,B0015D20FY,"I found this title when I did a simple Google search for ""best workout videos for women."" This one was on several of the lists, so after reading the reviews I ordered. I did not know Jackie before and I have never seen the Workout series on Bravo, but I liked the idea of short workouts that could be combined for a longer one.

This is not an easy workout. I've been doing Jillian Michaels and Amy Dixon for about 6 months now, and I was pleased to find a pretty challenging workout. I kind of like it when there's something I can't do on the first or second (or third or fourth) try because it gives me something to work up to and keeps me from getting bored. Jackie's workout definitely fits that bill.

The individual workouts - upper body, lower body, and core - are about 20 minutes each. The menu is easy to navigate, and if you choose more than one of the workouts there is an easy transition between the segments. Each segment begins with a short warmup that concentrates on the area to be worked. There are 4 trainers in the background, three incredible-looking women and one man, and each one does a portion of the workout under Jackie's instruction. Jackie mentions modifications for the upper body and the lower body workout, but mostly she points out ways to make it harder! I haven't taken her up on that offer yet. The core/ab workout is done by Jackie and all four trainers simultaneously, with one trainer consistently showing modifications to make it easier and one trainer showing the more challenging version.

I almost never like a workout video the first time I try it, so I try to use it for at least a week before I make a judgment. I'm so glad I did. I finally did the whole thing today for the first time, and I know I'll be feeling it for the rest of the day. Jackie is encouraging and easy to listen to without a lot of chit chat, which gets old when you watch the same video multiple times.

The only reasons I didn't give this 5 stars, and these are nitpicky but these are the kinds of things I like to know about a video:
*Stretches at the end of each segment are very short. Sometimes that's kind of nice when you're pressed for time, but I find myself wanting to pause the video if I've selected more than one segment.
*Jackie is encouraging, like I said, but sometimes I think we're moving on to another exercise when she says, ""Good job!"" Upon repeated viewings I'll probably get a feel for when the exercise is changing, but I've stopped several times thinking I was done. I may also be having this problem due to the fact that Jackie generally does each move for 1 minute instead of 30 seconds like I'm used to with Jillian Michaels.

This is DEFINITELY a great workout and DEFINITELY worth the purchase. You won't be sorry!",1364601600,,2762,4.38671875

The workout is challenging, but effective. Before I got this video I used to workout from home, but have achieved greater results from doing this video on a regular basis. I find the workouts fun to do. Jackie also emphasizes proper form on the exercises to avoid injury and to get the best results. I also enjoy the dialogue on the video but I am also a fan of the Workout television show, so if you aren't familiar with the people in the video you might not enjoy their dialogue as much. I like the lower body and ab workouts the best because the upper body workout doesn't seem quite challenging enough. I usually do additional work on my upper body.",1362528000,2,854,4.445859872611465

3143854,4,B0015D20FY,"This workout is changing my body. I exercise because I have to, and don't like pushing myself too hard. At 20 minutes a piece, I can handle doing each segment 1x a week. Additionally, I do cardio 3-4x a week. My abs are easiest for me to work on, and most responsive to exercise. My legs and arms are weaker, and my arms especially hard to tone.

Overall, while a great workout, this DVD takes some getting used to. Jackie switches between exercises quickly and without much instruction. You have to learn as you go, which isn't the worst thing. I cannot keep up with her pace yet but I am still getting a good workout.

It has a terrific abs segment. I've done pilates for years, and this workout had me feeling sore starting that same day. Between this dvd and her Xtreme Timesaver workout (also a great one), I'm losing inches off my waist.

The lower body workout is definitely a challenge, but I'm starting to see definition in my thighs, which is a real feat. My butt/calves still need work. My legs are so sore the day after I do this workout.

Maybe because my arms/upper body are stubborn, it's taking longer to change them. However, I'm building muscle. It'd be great to have her slow down so I can perform the exercises better.

All in all, you're getting an effective workout, considering I'm not willing to do anything too strenuous. It's not perfect, but I have yet to find the perfect workout.",1356048000,4,1408,4.484375
3143855,4,B0015D20FY,"Ok-the actual workout gets 5 stars-after I finish one I feel like I've really worked out that muscle groups and I'm definitely seeing results. It's also fairly simple-there's not a lot of coordination or complex movements so it's easy to really focus on form. I like Jackie-she's not perky or bubbly-but she is encouraging.

I like that in the arms and legs section she works one on one with on of the trainers-it gives the opportunity to really see their form and Jackie is really good about explaining form. Very nice for someone like myself who tends to get sloppy on form over time-keeps me in line.

The drawbacks-and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is twofold

The cuing is awful-there's so many points in the video where she says something that makes you think you're ready to move on to the next exercise when you're not. So you stop to move on to something else and realize-oh crap-we're not done. She even catches a couple of the trainers out with the crap cuing.

The other drawback - Ranessa - the most annoying trainer ever. The porn star voice, the moaning-so over the top. It makes me want to reach through the TV and strangle her.

It's a good workout DVD and after you do it a few times you know what's coming and get used to the crap cuing so it's not as irritating. The same can't be said for Ranessa.

Overall though it's a great workout, tough but doable and Jackie does a good job getting results.",1352332800,2,1423,4.432950191570881

I am a runner (and a pretty decent one) and that will always be my primary sport and workout. But it doesn't help my abs or my back, and as a distance runner my legs could use help, too. My arms are already fairly defined (toting babies around) but I am happy to get stronger!

I love this workout on my non-run days (and sometimes I do the core workout on my run days). I am not looking to lose weight per se - but I know when I am building muscle and THIS DOES IT. No goofy dance moves, everything you do here has a purpose. The techniques are fairly simple, but I find that I always have room to improve on form. There are some new moves in here - but they don't require a training session with the dance squad. I also like that you pick a ""move"" and just DO IT for 30-60 seconds. Too much choreography and I don't feel like I'm getting a work out, as I'm too busy thinking ""what the hell is a kickback side step switch out pop-back?""  Planks, sure. Squats, ok. Curls, alright now.

I appreciate that it's a FULL 60 minutes - not 45 or even 30 (too short!!). But you can still break it down if you are short on time. I don't find the ""cardio"" bits at the end of each weightlifting bit to raise my heartrate - but some of them do just blast out the muscle group you just worked a little more without killing you. And you're moving while catching your breath from the intense strength work.

FINALLY, a workout that blasts my muscles but doesn't ask me to dance around like an idiot. I tried to do a FIRM dvd that I had lying around and about 5 minutes in I ejected and put this one back in. I'm a distance runner, and I'm sorry but I don't ""grapevine"".",1346025600,6,1757,4.022922636103152
3143858,2,B0015D20FY,"I have a circuit training DVD from Jackie and really enjoyed it.  This DVD, however, is a joke. The set and the exercisers' outfits are ridiculous; very cheap looking.  The workout itself isn't terrible but it's really not special or enjoyable either.  I only did this workout once and will probably never do it again.",1341792000,2,318,4.745454545454545

3143870,5,B0015D20FY,"I loved the drama in Bravo's Workout and personally think Jackie is a riot. I am also a workout DVD fanatic, and as a result had to see if she was as great a trainer as portrayed on TV. I have to say, this is a pretty fun, high-energy, effective workout!

I won't bother to go into specifics about her workout segments since other reviewers have already done so. I will just say that I consider myself to be well-rounded when it comes to workout tapes. I have done everything from well known workouts like Jillian Michaels to lesser known workouts gurus like Jari Love. I am in good shape, and like a killer workout. Jackie definitely gets your heart rate going, and her moves are simple yet effective. I tend to use 5 pound weights when doing Bob Harper or Jillian Michael dvds, and I did have to use my 8 pound weights to feel the burn a bit more. Other than that, I would say Jackie can hang with the best of the home workout buffs!",1338163200,,935,4.252808988764045
3143871,5,B0015D20FY,"I've been so disillusioned with practically every workout dvds I've bought in the past-either they were too hard, too easy, or just too darned complicated to follow at home. I usually gave up on them after two or three times of trying to follow these dvd workouts. Finally, with One-On-One Training with Jackie, I've found a workout I can do at home when I can't make it to the gym. This dvd has three short, 20-minute circuit workout routines that are easy to follow and engages the abdominals from beginning to end. You can choose to do one workout, two or three in one viewing. Best of all, you can increase the intensity if you are at an intermediate or advanced level. Beginners will be able to follow easily since Jackie modifies all of the exercises to a less intense but effective workout. I highly recommend this dvd!",1337558400,,826,4.587837837837838
3143872,5,B0015D20FY,"This is my favorite ab workout of all time. The core routine takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. I'm a mother of three and it's easy to do during nap time in the comfort of my living room. You will definitely be sore after the first day or so doing this, but a week later and they seems to get easier and easier. You WILL get results doing these exercises. They are short in length, but VERY effective. I do them about 5 times a week, and my stomach stays flat and toned, and I have horrible genetics. Just takes some persistance! Anything worth having is worth working for! The other workouts on the video are good strengthening exercises also...",1329696000,,655,4.466666666666667
3143873,5,B0015D20FY,I have working out with some of Jackie's other dvd's and decided to give this one a try.  I was not disappointed.  The workouts are challenging but not discouraging.  I highly reccomend.,1326326400,,186,4.75
3143874,4,B0015D20FY,"i think a lot of users state that she just moves thru the reps too fast for the most part.  it's a great workout though, and when you reach the point that you can actually keep up with them, it's a good feeling of accomplishment.  when the cooldown comes, do yourself a favor, turn it off and do your own.  they don't hold them stretches long enough to be effective.  i've had this dvd for a couple years now, and i still love doing it.  especially the leg workout, love the squats.  not crazy about the ab section, i have problems doing planks and mountain climbers and v-situps, but i'll do it when i want a challenge....or push come to shove, i'll just do something else for the minute she does those!",1325721600,,704,4.295454545454546
3143875,5,B0015D20FY,"I love this workout DVD.  Jackie's approach of incorporating bursts of cardio into weight training is extremely effective.  I am out of breath throughout the workout and covered in sweat by the end.  I know it's working because I am sore the next day.  After regularly using the video, and consuming a healthy diet, for about a month there was a noticeable difference in my body.  Not only had I lost weight, but my body was toned.  I especially noticed a difference in my legs and butt.  They were firm, not flabby as they had been before.  I would recommend this video to anyone willing to complete a high intensity workout.  This is so much more effective than using an eliptical for an hour at the gym (burns more calories too!).  I also love the versatility.  You can do all 3 20 minute workouts or you can break them up and do 20 minutes a day.  The lower body is the toughest for me, so on days when I'm not feeling very energetic I will just do the upper body or the core workout instead.  I love that Jackie is encouraging withoug being annoying, like trainers in some other workout dvds.  Having been a fan of the show Workout on Bravo, I also enjoyed seeing the trainers from the show in the video.",1323993600,,1209,4.36322869955157
3143876,5,B0015D20FY,"I love that this video doesn't have a long, mandatory intro like the Jillian videos. That really gets on my nerves after about the 5th time watching it. I also love that there are three included workouts, upper body, lower body and abs. You can select which you want to do at the beginning and it stacks them up for you. The camera angles are great and you get a clear instruction on how to properly perform each exercise. It's a tough workout and lots of modifications are provided to make each exericse easier or more difficult as you progress. I love most of Jackie's videos and this is another great addition that will have a regular rotation in my daily fitness routine.",1322697600,2,675,4.495934959349594
3143877,5,B0015D20FY,"This is a great workout.  It's so cheap.  Buy it.

The actual content is well-described by other reviewers, so I'll avoid repeating.

I will say that I own a lot of exercise DVDs - Jackie, Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Bob Harper, Jeanette Jenkins.  This is my favorite in terms of effectiveness.  I've been doing it for 4 months and noticed results, especially in my arms.

This DVD focuses just on strength training.  I prefer this over the ""time saving"" workouts that combine strength training and cardio.

The production value is not as good as her later DVDs.  The demonstrators are annoying at first.  However, you do one exercise for about 40 seconds so you don't have to stare at the tv for most of the workout. That's another thing I like.

DVDs are personal, so I'm not sure how much this comment will help others, but I like Jackie's personality.  Much prefer her to Jillian Michaels.  Jackie is encouraging without being annoying.",1322352000,4,946,4.7592592592592595
3143878,5,B0015D20FY,"Of the three Jackie Warner workout videos I own, this is my favorite.  Jackie wastes no time, is straight forward, and has a good personality.  The moves are effective and if they are tough at first, they are something to work towards as you get stronger.  The ab workout is definitely intense.  Each 20 minute segment goes by quickly.  Awesome workout overall!",1318204800,,361,4.758064516129032
3143879,5,B0015D20FY,"I too have finally found a real keeper.  Jackie's workout targets all the major muscle groups and can be done mixing and matching the three 20 minute segments of upper body, lower body and abs/core or the full hour.  She gives you modifications to increase or decrease the intensity and difficulty of each move so you can continually progress in your routine rather than staying stagnate.  I suggest you have some background in fitness especially with proper form so that you don't injure yourself since she does move pretty fast through the routine which is why I believe it is so effective.  Each segment really works the muscles to the point of burning and it makes you sweat plus it really does fly by - ""fastest and funnest hour I have spent working out with weights""!  If you like this sort of thing this is the DVD for you.  I would consider this a seasoned beginner or intermediate workout.  The abs are fabulous and effective for any level!  I rated this one 5 stars and recommend it highly.",1316649600,,1000,4.578651685393258

And so umotivational! I would never want any of the people on this DVD train me!! They are just plain awful!! I do have a couple of her other DVDs which I really do enjoy - but, my advice is to stay away from this one! Get Personal Training with Jackie: Power Circuit Training  or Personal Training With Jackie: Xtreme Timesaver Training instead. Both are SO much better!!",1316563200,3,544,4.333333333333333

We're strapped for time and the 20 minute targeted workouts are perfect.  She starts with warm up, goes into weights and cardio and finishes with a stretch.  Did I mention we love it?",1315785600,,301,4.339285714285714
3143882,5,B0015D20FY,"I first found Jackie's DVDs on sale, and picked two up.  I instantly fell in love with her easy moves, her simple style, and her fun, energetic routines.  Now I have four of her DVDs and love them all.  They all have something different, and this one is my newest, and it didn't disappoint.  Jackie still has her ""helpers"" behind her, demonstrating the routines as Jackie corrects their form and gives you encouragement.  In this ""One-on-One"", Jackie only has one helper at a time take the floor, and Jackie works with them, and you, individually.  Jackie talks the helper through the routine, telling YOU how to correct the most common mistakes and what poor posture will do (or NOT do, as the case may be), motivating you to really get it right!  Rather than the camera flicking between two, three, or a room full of people like in some videos, in this one, Jackie and her helper are the sole focus of the camera, so YOU can figure out how/what to work on.  It's awesome.  I felt *almost* like I'd had a session with Jackie by the time the DVD was done.  (I say ""almost"", because at home, I can use lighter weights than I think Jackie would think I could use! ;) hahaha)

Overall, a great video, and really a helpful workout tool.",1315267200,,1232,4.455357142857143

Challenging but doable, and they don't drag on forever so there isn't time to get bored.  I can always feel like I have done a great workout right there in my living room!",1312156800,,265,4.28
3143884,5,B0015D20FY,"This DVD is incredible! Other reviewers have gone into a little more detail about the breakdown of exercises, so I will just tell you that good grief, this DVD will kill you, and I mean that in the best way. You can break the 3 workouts down to focus on just upper body, lower body, or abs, but doing all three takes just over an hour and is a fantastic workout. I was really surprised by the results it delivers.

I have been a fan of Jillian Michaels and her 30 Day Shred for a long time. That's a great workout when you consider that it's about 20 minutes and actually does work all your major muscle groups and get your your heart rate up and keep it there. It's a nice time-saver for Monday through Friday when you want to hit everything but just don't want to commit a full hour to working out. This workout, however, uses 20 minutes to focus on just one area and keep your heart rate up with cardio bursts throughout. It's very effective, as a result. They show you how the exercises can be modified to work for beginners or made more difficult (or as I call those modifications when I see them, ""freaking impossible,"" lol).

I worked out to different DVDs for about 20-30 minutes, 3x a week, before I got this DVD, so I wasn't totally a beginner. It did manage to make me feel like a beginner, though! It's very challenging, even for someone who isn't out-of-shape. I use 8 lb. weights for the weighted exercises and I can't imagine how long it would take for me to build up to using even 10 lbs. This workout is a strength-training powerhouse; I can tell I'm getting stronger every time I use it.

The premise of the video is one-on-one training. Each trainer comes up and has a little segment of a few exercises, with Jackie coaching them throughout and sometimes doing some of the moves as well. I think that's a good strategy. Groups of people can get out of synch in videos; with this DVD, you only have to watch one person. She does go immediately into the exercise and explains it during the reps, so as others have said, you may find yourself trying to catch up or rewinding it a bit during the first couple of viewings. She does give excellent pointers and tell you where you should be feeling each exercise.

Also, let me just say that looking at her abs fills me with a mix of hope, contempt, and jealousy. This lady is FIT. I can say in all seriousness, faithfully adding this workout to my repertoire does feel like it will get me a little closer to those cut abs that everyone wants to have. The ab workout is both doable and brutal. I've never been so sore in my abs from any other DVD, but personally, I want some soreness after a workout! I love feeling like I've REALLY gotten something done.

I'm really happy with this purchase. Again, I'm no noob to home workouts and I've got some of the best of them, but I'm almost hooked on this one. You can customize it for your level of fitness and for what areas you want to target, and you always feel like you've gotten a lot done the next day. If you get this and stick with it, you will see (and ow, yes, feel) the results.",1311465600,4,3097,4.287179487179487
3143885,5,B0015D20FY,Jackie Warner is an excellent trainer.  She is very upbeat and informative.  I use this video at a minimum of twice a week and have seen great results.  I think her core section is the best I have done.  She shows in great detail how each move should be performed for maximum results.  She has a very friendly and encouraging attitude to go for it and to work hard to advance your skills.,1309824000,,388,4.260273972602739
3143886,4,B0015D20FY,"I love Jackie Warner's workout dvds. I have the ""Power Circuit Training"", ""Xtreme Time Saver"" and ""Crunchless Abs"" Workout, which I would give all of those 5 stars.
I started working out with Jillian Michaels DVDS which i love, but once I tried ""Xtreme Time Saver"", I was hooked!
I really liked this dvd, but it was my least favorite out of the four. I think the workouts itself were really good, but I got annoyed with the other trainers in this dvd. The girls are cute, but they don't seem like their serious, in fact they way they act and look and sound, it makes me feel uncomfortable (like im watching a dirty movie). But I continue to use the dvd because I like the mixture of weight training and cardio moves.
If your looking for a good workout thats challenging and fun and kicks your butt, definately try Jackie!",1309478400,,821,4.443708609271523

3143889,5,B0015D20FY,"I have recently become slightly addicted to weight training, and this DVD has my absolute favorite upper body routine. Nice, solid, 20-minute workout that will leave your arms burning. Jackie gives you a lot of variety in moves and does a great job of explaining proper form.

The core routine is BRUTAL! I'm a chubby girl, so I was definitely following Renessa's modifications for the majority of the moves. But I can feel it working, I get stronger every time. I also like that Jackie has Jesse doing advanced modifications as well. It's nice to know that there will be ways for me to continue pushing myself and making things more challenging as I get stronger and fitter.

Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the lower body workout at all, but that's certainly not Jackie's fault. I have very bad knees and can't do workouts that involve a lot of lunges and squats. Ballet and pilates are pretty much the only lower body toning exercises my body can handle. So if you have bad knees, you may want to avoid this one. Otherwise, it looks like one heck of a workout.

There were definitely a couple things I could have done without. Firstly, I don't like that the trainers come up one by one in the upper and lower body workouts. I don't like waiting while Jackie congratulates one and calls the next one up. Come on, I'm working up a sweat here! Let's keep moving!

Also, Jackie throws in little bits of cardio throughout each workout. Personally, I like to do all of my strengthening first, then get some cardio in. That's just a personal preference however, and the cardio intervals are so short that it really doesn't bother me too much.

All in all, fantastic workout from Jackie. Very excited to try her other DVDs.",1307145600,2,1718,4.583061889250814

3143902,5,B0015D20FY,"I know it's a little late in the game to review this DVD since Jackie has added at least 5 more to the list since then but I have to shamefully admit to having this DVD on my shelf for well over a year before admitting defeat and the need to exercise the blasted baby weight off.  Let me add now that I also own ""30 Day Shred""--for me these two trainers are my preferred venue of great work outs without feeling as though I need to hire a dance coach on the side.  They are no-nonsense, sweat till you cry, and do it in less than 30 min.  I love both...They are not the same exercises but as I said it's all about feeling the burn and both move quickly from one work-out to another with little to no downtime.  Jillian has a wonderful all around workout, and Jackie breaks it down.  I go back and forth between these two with a little yoga on the side for stretch, and I tell you that in two weeks I've lost 5 lbs.  (Diet is very much a part of my weight loss arsenal).
Now, all that said, what excited and made me want to write this review for Jackie seeing that Jillian has a gazillion for 30-Day Shred is the core work out.  Holy black beans Batman!!!!  I can only do 60%, but when she says core she means CORE!  I am in awe of these, long since gone from Bravo, trainers.  Just watching them get thru everything without throwing a brick at Jackie's head impressed me.  To me this is core at its most intense.  Good going Jackie!!!!",1304035200,2,1435,4.103942652329749
3143903,5,B0015D20FY,"I recently tried my first Jackie Warner dvd and found I liked it so much that I am trying her other videos as well.  This one really got me sweating.  I am a daily exerciser who does a bit of everything, kickboxing, dance, pilates, yoga, walking, etc.  I do have some resistance videos but they tend not to be my favorites, but I know that it is important for my bones and to help burn fat so I gave this one a go. Once again, Jackie's cuing is spot-on.  She has a great style-not too drill sargeant and not too chirpy, she is encouraging but not over-the-top.  She doesn't just talk the moves, she actually does them and then tells you what you should or should not do to have good form.  She always has one of her trainers showing modified form which may be needed if you are newer to these types of exercises.  This dvd is comprised of three workouts, an upper body, lower body & core workout and each goes for 20 minutes.  Mind you, these are not 20 easy minutes....they are packed with intervals between toning and cardio to help you burn maximum calories.  You get in, exhaust the muscle and move to the next exercise so even if you do all three work-outs together it somehow seems to fly by.

The exercises are classics, chest presses, flys, kickbacks, military presses, crunches, planks, push-ups, squats, lunges etc.  No complicated steps, just good old-school exercises that are classics for a reason...they work!

If you want to get your blood pumping and get some excellent target toning, this one is for you.  I definitely would consider purchasing this dvd for myself and would recommend it to other intermediate/advanced exercisers who are looking for a good work-out.",1302825600,,1683,4.60738255033557

Oh, I am not in shape, but where I see results quick with this dvd is in my core area.  clothes become better fitting in only days!!!!  Now, of course also due to staying away from excess sugar and saturated fat.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone at any level.

It's a great mix of moves, some old ones as well as new, just up the weight and you'll get a better workout. For less than $30.00 (dvd and weights) I have a perfect workout to do at home. I'm on a mission to tone up and this is going to help me reach that goal.",1300147200,,642,3.9844961240310077

The only negative is that she has her individual trainers do different parts.  After their routine, they look exhausted and not able to carry on.  This makes me temped not to continue on with the next trainer's moves, after all if they can't do the entire routine, why should I.  Of course this is just to add interest or drama to the workout.",1294876800,,511,4.462365591397849

I usually find it silly when reviews mention how distracting sets/lighting/participants are.  I think that if you're focusing on the workout, it shouldn't be a big issue...

To my surprise, I found most of the trainers in this video to be extremely annoying and chatty.  I couldn't stand the banter back and forth between them and Jackie...'this is too easy', 'i'm really feeling this one'.  And the outfits made me roll my eyes.  I'm really not someone who pays attention to these things, but I just couldn't bear it.  And seeing them sitting in the background was terrible...at least make them not visible!

Plus you can see the trainers in the video struggling at times, which makes me feel better and keeps me motivated.  Jackie also is great at giving you just enough motivation right at the point you need it the most.  We will for sure be purchasing her other videos.",1292457600,,569,4.413461538461538

Loved that it was a quick 20min and my core was completely fatigued.  Great, fast-paced workout gives you some cardio in there, too, I'd highly recommend!  There are also Upper Body and Lower Body workouts included and they're good, but I'd say the Core is the most challenging of all 3.

3143932,5,B0015D20FY,"I own quite a few fitness DVDs and am always on the lookout for new ways to MOVE. When I first started my workouts, I was a bigger Jillian fan, but found some of her workouts were tremendously hard on some of my joints (particularly since recovering from an ACL/MCL injury). With Jillian, it is a harder cardio workout. With Jackie, my muscles experience the fatigue that I am aiming for in the work out without the soreness or joint pain. I started seeing more muscle tone. I am absolutely loving it and just ordered Jackie's other DVDs.

The other aspect I particularly like about this DVD is how the workouts are broken down. You have the option of customizing - upper body, legs and abs. Within each of the mini-workouts, there are additional breaks as she has different people come in to perform the exercises. With each person, there are approximately 3-4 exercises done, 1 minute each. As a result, there are the 5 second breaks that really enable you to exercise longer. Mentally, it is a good break and knowing that the exercises are relatively short (minute long), you remain motivated.

I am a convert. I can't wait to see what else she comes up with.",1291420800,4,1162,4.581730769230769

You can always talk yourself into at least 20 minutes of exercise with Jackie at the helm - she makes the time fly.  Jackie is professional, knows her stuff, and I like her rapport with her workout team (unlike Jillian Michaels  who, on 30-Day Shred, can only manage jock talk with ""my girls,"" as she calls the two very competent women who do the workout while Jillian flaps her gums).  Anyway, Jackie is a breath of fresh air.  The ab section is so effective and really varied, so it's fun (I can't believe I'm saying that!).  All the moves are creative, the set is not distracting, and Jackie's cuing is spot on, but she's not overly chatty or fake.  You can see from her interaction with her workout team that she's a caring trainer, and it makes you want to try harder.

That's not to say that they aren't still great workouts, they just aren't very cardio oriented. The lower body workout is great for targeting gluts and legs and actually did give me a cardio workout as well. I usually alternate this video with Jillian Micheals' NMTZ and BFBM. I can't say that I've lost weight using this video because I've been maintaining my target weight goal for a month or so and bought this video after I reached my goal, however I do feel like it's helping me to define my abs and tone up my legs and arms.

3143952,3,B0015D20FY,"I own this workout and keep coming back to it because it is an excellent workout that promises results. However, I would not recommend the workout for beginner exercisers or weight lifters. To start, Werner does not tell you which weights her trainers are using. I am a woman and began with 8lb weights, and moved down to 5lbs, which still guarantee a burn but will reduce your risk of injury. I'm not happy that I worked this out on a trial basis. Next, whenever she had her trainers perform a modification, Werner made it seem as if the modification would not be as beneficial to the exerciser. I know that some beginner exercisers may hear this and try to do the regular version of a move, thus increasing the chance for injury. It's OK to modify! I just wish she would have said that, it seems a bit negligent not to tell your client (i.e. the viewer) that modifications do still yield results. Next, there was no rhythm set, or if Werner did count out the moves it was out of time with the low-budget music. She did call for good form, but didn't give many very basic tips. Finally, the stretches. Why was I stretching my legs after the ab stretch, and why was I doing the cobra directly after a lower-back and butt workout? I found the lower body and ab stretches to be extremely counterintuitive, and I usually have to stop the video at that point and do my own cool down and stretch. Having said that, and although the workout is extremely boring and not so motivational, I keep coming back because it is a very comprehensive workout. My advice is to know your body, put on some music and just watch the video as a cue for when to change exercises, as the words coming out of Werner's mouth just get annoying.",1278028800,4,1717,4.40251572327044

3143955,4,B0015D20FY,I liked this workout. It is not my favorite but I am happy with it. I like the added short cardio segments vs. the other workout by Jackie (Power Circuit Training).

3143957,4,B0015D20FY,"Others have done a great job writing comprehensive reviews on the product. I think it's a great DVD for a beginning-to-intermediate exerciser, although if you are advanced, there's nothing that says you WON'T get a good workout (and she provides plenty of modifying opportunities to make the moves harder); there's just probably nothing on it that you haven't seen before. One thing that might be tough for the raw beginner is she moves fast. Not only does she move from exercise to exercise quickly, the move themselves are performed fast. I took away one star because of this--if you don't know what you're doing, going that fast can lead to injury but more than that, I found it kind of jerky and annoying. The other thing that bothered me (a tiny bit) was the sort of sycophantish perkiness of her colleagues (""oh Jackie, I LOVE this one!!!""), but some people might see it as encouragement and comraderie (and they might like working out with the people who are on her reality show).

3143958,5,B0015D20FY,"I was a fan of the show and was curious about Jackie's training methods, so I picked this up.  I do not enjoy working out to videos or DVD's as a rule but this one is an exception for me.  First I love the way the menu is set up.  There are three separate workouts that you can choose to do singly, altogether or in pairs.  The workouts themselves are extremely effective.  I consider myself to be an in shape woman as I do cardio and weight training most days of the week but these workouts absolutely fry me!  I have to advise you to take these slowly at first as I was sore for two weeks (honestly, two weeks) after the first time I did the lower body workout.  I do lunges, squats, kick backs, the bridge - all of the exercises that Jackie takes you through on this DVD at least twice a week but the non-stop 60 minute sets in combination with the lower body focused bursts of cardio she leads you through are super effective! As she explains on the video, she ""exhausts"" the muscle for maximum results.  My legs were literally quivering and I had very little strength left after my first time through the lower body workout.",1274313600,,1129,4.267605633802817
3143959,5,B0015D20FY,"This is an amazing workout. I've always done the entire 60 minute total workout and it is a killer!

The workouts are definately hard and they make you ""feel the burn"" etc. I get a little annoyed by the backup trainers as they seem to lack maturity. As for Jackie herself she does a good job of explaining good form etc. It does bother me a little that she really dosn't put much effort into doing the exercises herself. Most of the time she is just talking. She will also say ""you're almost there"" when you aren't even close. Now that I have my complaints out of the way I will tell you that I have seen results, especially in my arms and abs. I really dread the core/abs portion of this wokout only because it is really hard...a good kind of hard. There are modifications of all the exercises (harder and easier)so don't be intimidated if your just starting out. If you are looking for a good mix of cardio and strength this is a good choice.

I have used this dvd (in conjuction with others) for over a month.  Now I need to use heavier weights for most of the exercises.  Combined with the heart rate being relatively high OUTSIDE of the cardio Jackie has added in this workout, and it's clear the fat is melting.

I like the cardio and the fact that she takes it back to basics your not doing some off the wall thing to your body.  You just need some weights and a mat .

This dvd has been in the rotation for almost a year and is still a good workout that leaves my muscles fatigued. You get to choose arms, legs, or stomach, or any combination of those. I'm a big fan of the arms workout. Not only do you do arm exercises, but you also do quick 1 minute cardio blasts to keep your heart rate up. The stomach exercise is also a favorite of mine. It's especially nice because she has one trainer showing how to do the exercise low impact, two showing medium, and one showing high impact usually with weights. So as you progress, you know what to do to increase your strength. This is basically a pick-your-spot exercise dvd.

I was wrong - and on Saturday, I decided to finally open this DVD and complete the whole workout.  It was amazing and I can't wait to do it again!!  Unfortunately, I have to wait and rest - since my arms and shoulders are so sore.  After one workout, I already feel stronger.  I'm excited to see the results after one to two months as others have mentioned in their reviews.  You will definitely feel this workout all over.  Jackie reminds you when movements are suppose to 'burn' and to do only part of the movement if you can't keep up with the full ones.
The upper body workout is definitely my favorite, however, the core workout comes in a close second.  There are even modified movements done by one of the other trainers - helpful for someone like me who still has a sensitive neck from a car accident years ago.
I love this - just wish I had opened it sooner!",1266192000,,1051,4.2727272727272725

I like that this workout incorporates cardio in with the strength training moves, which her other one does not, but this one also requires a little more time - better for days when I have a little extra time to workout and really want to sweat (and curse).  Jackie is very focused on form and very motivational and she also offers modifications for easier and harder, which is key.  I like that instead of working the whole body (like Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred) it works one zone at a time - abs, upper body, lower body - so you can rotate them doing each one for 3 days out of a week or do each one once during the week if you prefer.

THE NEGATIVES: This DVD, Workout: One on One Training with Jackie, is fast-paced nearly to a fault. I felt as though I was struggling to keep good form because I was trying so hard to simply keep up with the moves due to the lack of cues.

Jackie, along with her trainers, jump right into the moves with little explanation and then focus/explain the form after the move has begun. Perhaps it's just personal preference, but I like to have a bit of preparation before jumping into a move.

I also felt like the format was a bit casual/haphazard. Each trainer did some one-on-one moves with Jackie, then sat on a large exercise ball in the back, watching. It was a bit weird.

THE POSITIVES: It's a great workout and one that left me quite sore the next day. The fast pace keeps you on your toes and makes the time go by very quickly. I love that I can pick and choose which moves I'd like to include from the menu. My legs were so sore from working out earlier that I did myself a favor and left the lower body workout out that day. It's great for a brief workout (each set, uppper, lower and abs are just 20 minutes each) or an extended workout if time allows.

Jackie does a great job of showing ways to make each move easier or harder, depending on your skill level. Overall, I loved this workout and would recommend it.",1263859200,3,1574,4.376712328767123

This DVD is different and a nice break from all my others that have more cardio, because now I am trying to focus more on strength after so many years of neglecting that for cardio only.  My body feels firmer already.
I definitely want to get her other DVD since I like this one so much.
As far as what the other trainers are doing in the background, I could care less.  That bothered me in now way at all.

3143972,5,B0015D20FY,"I had always wanted my own fitness DVD, but I am very hesitant about how I spend my money. I had always done free workouts from On-Demand on my TV. None of them really pushed you past 'that' limit that went beyond following along someone trying to put you into a bunch of pointless positions for 20 minutes that weren't even that challenging, until one day I tried a new workout on demand that blew my mind and was the only real workout I'd done from TV that if I knew I kept up with it would actually help me become more fit. I noticed that it was only on On Demand for a limited amount of time and didn't want to lose being able to do the exercises on the video, and I noticed an ad that came up after I did it saying you could buy her DVD with those exercises on it. I was actually really excited to buy this DVD. When I got it I noticed it not only had the Core Workout I did on my TV, but two other seperate workouts that were equally as challenging for your arms and your legs/butt. I am STILL working up to the point where I can even make it through the core with out having to take a break - these workouts are straight to the point and transition from a certain work-out for that area to another challenging position that challenges that area. She mixes both cardio and sweating with muscle-building workouts. by the time I am done with it I am red and sweaty and sometimes I want to yell I try so hard!

Combining this workout with running and eating well yields amazing results, let me tell you. Although I work behind a counter, I have been asked if I was a gymnast by a random customer because I had gained nice muscle tone especially in my butt and midsection from this video combined with running. Also if I did ballet. This was about 3 months after I had begun doing the video a few times a week and running as well. I have always been relatively small and thin, but have never really had muscle tone until beginning my workouts. SO i think I have said enough about how life-changing this has been for me! Good luck to anyone else and all I have to say is don't give up and push yourself every time!",1262390400,7,2115,4.133495145631068
3143973,4,B0015D20FY,"Jackie does good 20 minute workouts.  Sometimes the full minute of one exercise is a little grueling because I'm used to pushing it for just 30 seconds.  Also, it's not always obvious when one exercise is getting near the end.  I think it's nice to have the trainer push you for just, ""5 more seconds"" so you see an end in sight and push yourself.  I like the variety, though!",1261958400,2,376,4.328571428571428
3143974,5,B0015D20FY,"I don't even know where to begin. I have been doing this workout tape for over a year now (twice a week) and it has changed my life....literally! I have always hated my body and wanted to work out, but didn't want to get a gym membership because of the cost. This DVD has given me the body I want: muscular and tight without being too muscular.
  Although it is true that these excercises aren't for beginners, Jackie shows you a modified version of each exercise that is geared toward beginners. You will be doing strength training AND cardio in this workout, so there is no need for a seperate routine for cardio.
  I have always had love handles and a ""pooch"" and a large saggy behind, but now I have a six pack, a strong muscular lower back, and a rock hard behind (although still large, it's all muscle :-D).
  She breaks it up into upper, lower, and core workouts so that if you don't have trouble with one of these areas of your body (for me this is my upper body), you don't have to waste your time working that part out. They are 20 minutes each and contain anywhere from 15-20 excercises in each, with stretching at the ends of each.
  To sum up, I would highly recommend this product if you'd like to get in great shape and MAINTAIN that shape in very little time (I saw results within a month) and very little time each week. Any woman, I believe, can have their self-image completely turned around with this DVD! You will love your body and you don't even need to go to the gym!

Well worth the time it took to complete. It's broken up into three twenty minute sections that I do throughout the day when I get a chance or makes one hell of workout done straight through.  Jackie Warner is not one of those annoying workout instructors and her explanations of each exercise were great.

Mixing cardio and strength training, anyone is sure to benefit from her easy to follow routines based on upper body, lower body, and core training. You can do each twenty minute work out alone, or combine them together for a forty or sixty minute ultra work out. I really enjoy this DVD for working out.

I have had a personal trainer before at my local gym and this is very comparable to that experience.  If you like Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, then you enjoy this video as well.  I was very sore the next day.  Her workout style is very effective.  I would not recommend this video to a beginner since it is pretty intense.

3143984,5,B0015D20FY,"I'm in my late 30s and have been trying to get myself motivated to get back in shape since I sort of let myself go for a while after I got married and didn't live near a gym and couldn't be bothered with heavy traffic to get to a gym.  It's hard for me to stick to most workout videos (trust me, I've purchased a lot) because I quickly lose interest.  I first saw this video on Comcast Exercise on Demand and could barely get through it, but I really liked how it was broken down based on what I felt like doing at the moment.  I eventually purchased this video and have no regret that I did.  The way this video is broken down into three 20 minute workouts makes it ideal to use when you have a lot of time or not a lot of time.  On days where work eats up most of my time, I love to do the 20 minute core workout since it mainly works out your core but your arms and legs get some workout as well during the aerobic interval. There's so many variations to work on different parts of your core that you just don't have time to get bored.  The upper body workout is very effective -- no more muffin tops when I wear mid to lowrise jeans/pants.  When I first did the upper body, I could barely finish it.  As time went by, I felt my upper body getting stronger and I can do heavier weights and definitely more pushups -- my arms are actually toned now so I was able to wear tank tops all summer proudly.  The lower body is my least favorite mainly because my muscles are so sore for like 2-3 days afterwards, however, it works but makes me fearful of the pain afterwards!  So for me, this is definitely my favorite workout video since it ""helped"" me get back into shape!",1253664000,3,1669,4.07645259938838

There is much focus on appearance and hairstyles, and not so much on making the workouts interesting or especially challenging- with the exception of the ab section. The dvd is broken into 3, 20 minute sections which focus on different body parts. I would rather have a workout that combines them into one. Perhaps I didn't research it well enough.

3143992,4,B0015D20FY,"I was hesitant to buy this DVD as I am a fan of the show and witnessed the chaos that ensued when they were filming it (as shown on the tv show)... I was sad that Erika isn't on the DVD as she's my favorite on the show and that Rebecca was there instead and I truly can't stand her. It was actually funny because I felt like I knew the people I was working out with, is that weird? LOL I found it amusing when Jackie would tease the trainers, especially Jesse. But I got it because I watch the show, not sure how someone would react to the interactions if they don't watch the show...

All that aside, I was literally SOAKED in sweat during this work-out, and I'm not a beginner (I work out 5-6 times a week). It was dripping off me, literally! Therefore I don't understand why someone in one of these negative reviews could say they didn't burn any calories... who says you can only burn calories from cardio??? And its not like there was no cardio. If it feels too easy, increase your weight, plain and simple. I started out with 8lbs but downsized to 5lbs because of the high number of reps (which I liked!). I do plan to do this one again, it's not my favorite but it's not the worst. Its comprehensive, easy to follow and it gets the job done.

Just as an after thought, it didn't bother me that Jackie wasn't doing the exercises the whole time and did more instructing. But it DID bug me when Jillian Michael's in 30-Day Shred doesn't do hers... Maybe because I know the trainers in Jackie's video know what they're doing and aren't just back-up dancers like Jillians!",1250035200,,1574,4.296296296296297

i just received it yesterday, and not wanting to get my a*s kicked too bad, i thought it would serve my interest to do just one of the 20 minute sessions, to try and get used to the pace and how she operates.

needless to say, i still got my bum kicked! i did the Abs session, and while the exercises are oldies but goodies, it BURNED! but in the good- 'im working it!' way :) im quite sore this morning.

My favorite aspects :

1) Unlike Jillian Michaels, Jackie tries to motivate you and keep you going without being ridiculously CHEESY. Her motivation works!

2) She has four of her trainers do the exercises behind her, and two of those trainers show moderations of each exercise- one easier, and one harder. It caters to all levels of fitness

3143995,5,B0015D20FY,I would recommend this product to anyone. There are modifications for the more difficult/challenging exercises if you are not in shape. And modifications to make the exercises more challenging if you are in shape. The three circuits offer a complete body workout. The DVD has a great pace with great tips to ensure you are doing the exercises correctly. This DVD helped me get in shape for summer in addition i also run 5 days a week. The combination helped me drop weight and tone my body. I plan on continuing to use this DVD. It has been one month and I definitely notice the difference and can see more muscle definition.,1247443200,,625,4.589285714285714
3143996,4,B0015D20FY,"This DVD contains 3 twenty minute workouts that focus on upper body, lower body, or the core which you can do together or separately.  Each workout is comprised of intervals of both strength and cardio moves that are done for a minute each.  Generally, for every four strength exercises, there is one cardio move that follows.  In all likelihood, you've seen most of the exercises on this DVD a thousand times before - squats, lunges, crunches, bicep curls, etc. However, for what this tape lacks in fun factor, it definitely delivers a tough workout.  I can always feel my muscles the day after (especially my hip flexors for whatever reason).  In addition, the minute-per-exercise approach is great for motivation - as Jackie says, you can do anything for a minute, so it motivates you to push through.

For each of the workouts, Jackie is in the lead with four trainers behind her.  In the upper and lower body workouts, Jackie works with one trainer at a time.  In the core workout, all the trainers are working out at once.  One demonstrates beginner modifications while another shows advanced modifications.  A purely aesthetic complaint is the incredible amount of makeup each trainer is wearing ALL OVER their body. I sometimes find myself staring at their abs and wondering what it must be like to be slathered in bronzer there.  Also, I find myself staring at the other trainers in the background during the upper and lower body workouts - it seems like a waste that they're doing nothing and sometimes they look quite bored.

Overall, I think this is a highly effective exercise DVD for the short amount of time required for each workout.  It's not necessarily the most fun you'll ever have, but it certainly does work.",1247356800,,1730,4.804054054054054

3144010,5,B0015D20FY,"I love this DVD!!! I usually don't write reviews about items I have purchased, but I have to write one about this because it is one of the best workout DVDs I have ever used!!

If you're looking to get in shape, this is where it's at. It is a super intense weight workout mixed with cardio sections to specifically target the areas just exercised. It's a great design. Some of the moves are incredibly challenging, but do-able especially with the positive reinforcement intermixed from Jackie and her trainers.

I am a pretty active person and this workout really gets my muscles sore and I have seen terrific definition in just a couple weeks. The DVD is also great because you can choose to do all 3 (upper,lower,core) workouts consecutively or individually choose and the DVD automatically plays your selection back-to-back. (The core workout is extremely challenging and when chosen with one or two other workouts it is always last, so I like to play it first so that I am not worn-out by the time I have to do what's already a strenuous workout.) Get your water bottle ready, you'll definitely need it after the cardio sections.

This DVD actually makes me sweat (coming from someone that doesn't break a sweat very easily). If you want great results, stick with it and do at least one of the exercises daily. Get your bootcamp mentality ready because Jackie's definitely going to give you a swift kick...but totally worth every second. The 20 min segments are great and are broken down into shorter segments which makes them seem concise.

Great for people who enjoy a good workout and feeling sore. All the exercises can be made more simple (for beginners) or stepped up a notch (for the over-achievers).

I cannot say enough good things about the DVD...I absolutely love it. I just wish there were more DVDs from Jackie b/c I love her style.

More than that, I can now several push ups-- which I have never been able to do before. I highly, highly recommend this video!",1240531200,3,501,4.166666666666667

3144014,5,B0015D20FY,"I bought this DVD assuming 'oh yea I know who that is I'll try it' and man was I blown away. It's actually pretty intense while still being sutable for beginners. And when your doing the exercises you just want to stop but believe it not her 'boot camp' attitude keep you going and encourage you to never quit. What I really love is that it Never gets Boring or repetitious. She switches it up every 60 seconds. So your never stuck counting or waiting to do something else. It really keeps me going. After 3 days i could feel my buns lifting and after a week of the abs/ core set, i already started getting a two pack! lol thats a huge step for someone who hasn't exercised in two years! This is by far the best workout DVD I own. It's the PERFECT solution to not have to haul yourself to a gym everyday. I looove it!",1240272000,,817,4.144654088050315

She shows modifications for people needing less and more intensity than what the original exercise is which really helped as some days I can do more than others.

They are 20 minute workouts each. You will need a yoga mat and some hands weights.  This workout is really challenging and they show different ways to do the workout for the different levels.  I like Jackie's attitude and she really pushes you to finish the whole workout. I was really surprised at the different forms and the moves.  Start off with lower weights and challenge yourself with the tougher moves and increase the weight as you progress.  I am looking forward to the next series.,1239580800,,668,4.579831932773109
3144018,5,B0015D20FY,"I got this after reading a positive review of it on SparkPeople by Coach Nicole.

I was very pleased with it.  It really works you as hard as you want it to, Jackie shows you variations on all the moves, and she stresses proper form.  I like that it's broke up in 20-minute workouts (one each for upper body, lower body, and abs).  You can do one, two, or all three.  I also liked how she fit in some cardio in each segment, it's great to get more burn by raising your heartrate.  Each set of exercises are done for a minute, and you usually do 2-3 sets, then 1 minute of cardio, and repeat this sequence until it's done.  Each 20-minute segment has a warm-up and a cool-down.

I love this DVD and would tell anybody looking for a new strength training video to try this one out!",1238630400,,779,4.181208053691275

Very good challenge to your stamina, however it provides the cardio workout that a circuit training workout provides, not one that a one hour jog around the neighborhood does. (Those two vary in their results, in my opinion.) This will definitely make you stronger and more toned. I think even doing this workout a couple times a week would be enough to get the toning and strength. Concentrating on cardio for the rest of the week would make it even better.",1236988800,,642,4.487179487179487

If I want cardio than I just do one of my other video's.  I have only used this video six times and can see muscle definition!  I really do feel the burn while doing this workout.  For all the ppl who complained that it wasn't challenging enough, Jackie tells you as well as shows you what to do if you need to modify the moves to make them easier or more challenging.  I feel that this video will grow with me.  I have nothing but positive things to say about this video.",1236643200,,602,4.0508474576271185

The workout as a whole is confusing and there isn't a lot of fluidity between each exercise. The two trainers in the front doing modified (tough and beginners) were great to watch and helpful. The other two trainers (Rebecca and Agostina) were terrible and like watching 2 dead fish. Jackie was motivating but with 2 non-expressive, boring to watch trainers behind her it made it difficult to stay motivated.
The Biggest Loser DVD's are better workouts with better trainers and better people on the DVD's.",1236556800,6,635,4.628318584070796
3144027,5,B0015D20FY,"I just have to rave about One-on-One Training with Jackie.  It is the bomb!  It is an excellent strength-training workout that is varied and never boring.  There are three 20-minute long workouts:  upper body, lower body and core.  Today I did upper body and lower body.  I was never bored.  The routines are varied and challenging yet not overly so.  And I can't say enough about Jackie Warner.  I really like her style.  She is not brash or loud.  She provides just the right amount of encouragement without being patronizing.  And she's all about form so she takes time out to say what position each part of your body should be in as you do the exercise.  I sweated and breathed hard but I feel really good.  Initially, in fact, I was only going to do one routine today but I loved it so much, I did another.  If I had more time, I would probably do the last one!  I give this one five stars for sure!",1236470400,,904,4.291666666666667

I'd have to say that even after 2 children, my abs have never looked better. I finally have obliques and really strong lower abdominals!!

The exercises can be challenging but each one is only 30-60 seconds long, so anyone can get through it. Jackie incorporates a bit of cardio after each strength exercise to get your heartbeat up, and it's also motivating to see the trainer's muscles while you're doing the exercises.

You will be sore. You will be tired. But, you WILL see results!!",1236211200,,660,4.632478632478633

Pros: She shows you how to modify each exercise with less intensity or more intensity. She focuses a lot on correct form so that you don't get injured. The person showing you the exercise changes every 5 minutes or so, so it doesn't get boring. Workouts are customizable so you can include lower body, upper body and core in the order you choose, using 1-3 workouts at a time.

Cons: Jackie is a little annoying. It's obvious that she's into herself when she says in a couple of the segments, ""I could do this all day!"" The trainers who demonstrate the exercises can also be corny.",1235865600,,689,4.548387096774194

My favorite section of WORKOUT is the abs segment! This segment is good for those days when I just feel like doing straight cardio but want to add an abs component.",1235779200,,473,4.448275862068965

Each workout lasts 20 minutes but of course you can be your own gauge. Jackie shows some excellent and effective moves. Also all moves are pretty uncomplicated, they can be challenging but it is not like you stare at the screen while the instructor rushes away without you.

The abs part combines an abs workout with aerobics with makes it a lot harder than most abs workouts that I have done.

I LOVE WORK OUT and love Jackie and the trainers so of course when I saw this DVD I had to get it. Today I did it for the first time and honestly I am pretty out of shape compared to what I used to be...I loved this dvd I did all three 20 min workouts together and plan to do them 3 times a week, I have to say by the last 20 min doing core I was pretty exhausted and I am def feeling it. I really think this is going to a great jump start to start shedding these pounds...the dvd is great and you cant pass up the price.

3144042,4,B0015D20FY,"Overall, I liked this workout for the variety of moves and challenge provided - hence 4 stars. I would say definitely not for beginners though. The big gripe I have is that the moves are not in time with the music - they are mostly off the beat or a mix of off and on the beat so hard to get used to - I just went at my own pace to avoid annoyance with this. The second gripe is that some moves I think are way too fast to be safe. In particular, the roll to the side with both legs - again you can just slow up to modify. All that said it is a solid 3-set workout and the 20 mins per set has you feeling it.",1233619200,2,608,3.6846153846153844
3144043,5,B0015D20FY,This is a great video. I like that you can break it up and not have to do the whole 60 minutes. It also has a feature where you can select which workout you want to do together if you decide to. I must admit that even though each workout is 20 minutes it's a hard workout since you have to do each move for a minute and it makes you realize how long a minute really is.,1233273600,5,369,3.7435897435897436
3144044,5,B0015D20FY,I loooove this workout!!  The abs segment is especially awesome.  It's so tough and that's what I was looking for!  Something to kick my butt into shape!

3144045,5,B0015D20FY,"I could not wait to get this DVD! First let me say that 2 weeks ago, my body was aching alot more than it normal does. I am obese at 5'10 and 290. So I mustered the courage to get on the scale and saw that I had put on 20 pounds (was 270). That night I thought to myself ""oh he#@ no"" and went through my kitchen and threw out the chips, chocolate cookies and everything that had sugar in it. Jackie says that sugar is the devil!
I am now eating grilled fish and chicken with green salad, using olive oil and lemon juice as dressing.  I have increased my water intake to about 3 liters a day where as before that is how much pepsi I would drink.  Looking back i'm thankful that I never got diabetes.

So my dvd arrived! I started out with core because I think it will help with lower back pain. I know the weight pulls at my spine. AND OH!!! the core workout had me catching cramps in those muscles that I never use. I somehow ended up in the floor curled up in the fetal position from the pain. Luckily my hubby was at home and reminded me of the ""cobra"" stretch in yoga and that worked the cramp right out. I started the dvd over and actually got through the whole 20 minute core section and have done it few more times. I feel better now and it almost seems weird but the more i work on the core, the less i want to eat. Granted I started out eating an embarassing 3,200 calories a day, now i eat about 1,400-1,500 and am down from 290 lbs. to 278 lbs.

Something about it is different this time. I have made a true commitment! My hubby thinks its so sexy when he sees me working out! LOL
I'm not even at my goal of 170lbs. and he can't keep his hands off!

I strongly recommend the dvd to anyone. My body still aches but for a totally different reason now> And I am seeing results and my self- confidence is beginning to shoot through the roof!",1233100800,7,1847,4.03551912568306
3144046,5,B0015D20FY,"After doing this workout 3 times a week for a month, I can honestly say it works.  I'm impressed with the results I'm getting in a relatively short amount of time.  My arms, shoulders, and legs are showing nice definition.  My abs are a work in progress.  Even though I don't have a six pack at this time, my abdominal bed has gotten a lot stronger.

I like that I can customize my workout depending on how much time I have.  I try to do the 60 minute workout in it's entirety but when time is limited, it's good to know that I can break it up throughout the day.

For those who complained about the airbrushed six packs, the lighting that is used during filming tends to wash out all details.  That's why the abs are shaded in.  The same thing happens with eyebrows.  In that kind of lighting, it is necessary.  If you look at all the cast members, they all have a low fat percentage so they more than likely have six packs but they wouldn't show up under those lighting conditions.

I also wasn't put off by the fact that Jackie isn't doing the workouts.  She's there as a trainer.  If you were to hire a personal trainer, they would coach you during your workouts but they're not going to do them with you.

I judge a workout by how effective it is.  I don't care about the background or the music.  I just want a workout that gives me results.  This workout definitely is giving me the results.  It is a good addition to my workout DVDs collection.",1233014400,,1452,4.252747252747253

I did the whole 60 min. because it was such a good work out that I hated to stop.  You can break it up into the 20 minute intervals though if you like.  This will for sure be one of my favorites , if not my very favorite.  I like the ones that really work your body. What's the point in doing a DVD if you can't reap the benefits of it?!

This DVD is the perfect addition to my weekly workouts. I love how you can modify or increase resistance. For instance, I played it conservative with the amount of weights for the upper body and next time I'll use more, but since my abs are weaker, I did the modifications. Very customized and I like how it sets a ""bar"" to work up to with the more intense versions of all the exercises.

I took this on vacation and used my own body weight or resistance bands and it was perfect.  No excuse to not workout because it's easy to do anywhere as long as you have a DVD player!

This DVD has it all with upper body, lower body and core workouts featuring Jackie and four of the instructors from the Bravo series Work Out, Jesse, Rebecca, Augustina and Renessa.  All of the exercises are pretty intense and if you haven't worked out in a while you'll need to take it slow and work up to full speed.

I have a large collection of exercise DVD's but this is one of the most serious, and based on my pain this morning, one of the most effective ones.  It's fun to watch and not one that will get old quickly.  Having seen the instructors on the TV show adds interest to the work out.  Highly recommended.",1231459200,,709,4.366412213740458
3144054,5,B0015D20FY,"Jackie Warner's ""Workout"" is one of my favorite workout dvds right now.  The other is Jillian Michaels's ""30 Day Shred.""  My main form of exercise in the past was running, but I reluctantly gave it up when my knees became a limitation (I like to workout hard almost every day but my knees can't take the punishment of even slow running more than a few times a week).  Also, running takes a lot of time, and, as a dad to a newborn, I do not have a spare hour except after dark, which is a miserable time to run in the winter.  ""Workout"" is a perfect replacement for me because it offers three hard workouts that I can do at home in the evening regardless of the conditions outside.  The workouts each take all of twenty minutes and allow me to push hard without experiencing any knee pain.

I thought that the filming was amateurish; the choreography was lame and neither Jackie nor her trainers could keep a beat to save their lives.  If I was new to exercising and used this DVD as a guide, if I paid any attention to Rebecca, I would wind up with the worst form on the planet.  I would also have no clue as to what I was doing because I felt that the explanation that went with each exercise was strongly lacking in detail.  In summary, this DVD was a HUGE letdown.

Within two weeks of doing the workout (3-4x/week), I noticed results. The subscription ended after three weeks, so I ordered the DVD because I knew I wouldn't keep up with the routine otherwise. Best $10 I have ever spent! For only 20 minutes per body part, you can't go wrong. I continue to see results and am very pleased with the routine. Some tend to get monotonous but this workout is easy to follow and Jackie offers an array of exercises to keep you moving and motivated. I must admit, I've only done the upper body and abs portion of ""Workout"" but I am sure the lower body excercises will be just as beneficial to you as the other two have been for me. A definite BUY!

The video uses a combination of your own body weight and free weights so if you don't have weights, buy some! Nothing too heavy (at least not at the beginning) - five pound free weights will suffice.",1231113600,,1039,4.411458333333333

Let me just say that it is hard and I exercise about 5-6 days per week, and that includes running. The Core part was the most dificult of the 3. Great exercise DVD and time goes by very fast since it's only a minute per exercise. I am doing this DVD(the 3 parts) 3 times a week for almost a month, and I am seeing changes in the way my upper body looks. My shoulders and back are looking more defined. This DVD really works if you do it 3 times a week. You will sweat a lot and will want to do it again since you will start noticing changes in the way your body looks. I am extremely happy I gave Jackie a chance. I love this one.",1230940800,2,761,3.8846153846153846

I did 20 min a day and alternated between core, lower body, and upper body.  I recommend getting a good set of hand weights for this dvd.  The best thing about this dvd, she uses weight training and cardo, and there are different levels of each movement, and for each targeted area you work every muscle group.  Its the best!!!

This workout is one that can be done by all fitness levels. I normally think I'm pretty intermediate, but found myself using the beginner's modifications on the core section. It's nice to have something to work up to, I suppose.

I recommend this as an exerciser who is constantly seeking out new routines, as a person who lives in a cold climate and doesn't always feel like going to the gym to get a good workout, and finally as a Bravo junkie.",1230768000,3,718,4.473282442748092

I have a gym membership, and I'll go and do cardio but I like to come home to work out with this video, especially the abs.  The abs is really tough and I have no doubt that doing this ab workout three times a week will get me to having those abs I've always wanted.  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend the Crunch Bootcamp, but it does a whole body workout, so you'll need a day of rest in between strenght training because you can't separate the workout.",1230681600,,765,4.263888888888889

I love that the whole workout is so fast paced because it makes it harder to get lazy and give up, you just want to finish since every exercise is only a minute long. But don't let that fool you, that minute can really be hard. I went through the entire workout but at the core I was so tired and in pain (I'm a beginner) that I kinda gave up here and there but it's definitely something you need to work up to. The core is the hardest one since you really need to focus on form so maybe I'll switch and do it first next time. I do feel much better today though. I'm at 120 lbs and a little out of shape so this video will definitely get me toned up and that's all I want. And the bits of cardio that Jackie puts in the middle of each set are a plus. Overall this is a good video. The hour just flies by and in the end you feel good about yourself that all areas have been targeted. The price definitely beats gym prices and the inconvenience of actually taking out time to go to classes makes this an excellent investment. This is a perfect video to get toned up and get your heart rate pumped up (for those ppl who have a sedentary lifestyle like me).

Usually there is always some truth to the negative reviews...but after getting this DVD....I see there is alot of ""haters"" out there....

Or maybe its the guy she fired from Skysport making up negative reviews to hurt her sales...

Let me just say....this video is hard....not impossible..but hard....for the intermediate...although a beginner has the modified versions that they can work with.

You feel it....

As a person who is an avid runner....I love when I feel similar pain .. that feeling of  muscle fatigue.....although not howling in agony..I do feel a resulting  stiffness with this dvd..

There are some great twists on the traditional excercises....and some new ones that work great...

I wouldnt compare it to the Biggest Loser DVD...apples and oranges...due to the words of motivation and the trainers.

If you watch the Biggest Loser...you know that these are really obese people who need to be nurtured and loved...to achieve their goals...

Jackie's video assumes that you have passed that stage ..and are ready for the next level- that you just need alittle coaching to get you through

They are both great videos....

I would say this video...is like P90x ..but not cheesy and not as intense...

3144065,3,B0015D20FY,"I just got this DVD yesterday, and I have done the workout once.  It's 20 minutes of upper body, 20 minutes of lower body, and 20 minutes of core exercises.  I did all 3.

I thought the lower body section was the most intense, with lots of lunges, squats, and cardio sections that repeated movements from the weight training (like plyometric squats).  I was glad the core section is 20 minutes and more intense than some of the shorter, 10-minute workouts I have.  Definitely felt it!

The upper body sections hits everything, back, shoulders, triceps, etc., but seemed to just touch on each body part and not really fully work any individual muscle.  I was a bit disappointed with this section, but then, they are trying to fit a lot into 20 minutes.

The instructors in this DVD are a bit lacking in personality.  They aren't the most motivating or fun bunch to lead a workout, but their form and instruction is good. One lady's bizarre bra-with-a-vest outfit was a bit distracting (who dresses like that to work out...or ever?)

All in all this workout is a bit dull but effective for the lower body and abs, so I'll keep it.",1229385600,2,1128,4.567164179104478

I think that it's pretty good for her first one, and I bet she'll come out with even better ones as time goes on. I have to pry myself off the floor sometimes after she kicks my a** for 60 minutes! (I prefer to do the whole thing instead of breaking it up into the 20 minute segments) So, summing it all up, this DVD gives you the best bang for your buck...and if you watch the show, you'll feel like you are exercising with friends!

This is one of my favorites so far because it doesn't seem like an hour of exercise (at least not until the next day!).  I like the fact that she spends a full minute on each exercise instead of just 10-12 reps.  You have time to work on form and really get it right.

3144069,5,B0015D20FY,"I work out at a health club (cardio and circuit), but not regularly enough to achieve good results (at age 40+), so I was looking for a flexible at-home solution to augment the health club.

I'll give that the Bravo reality show ""Workout"" was entertaining and motivating (The Good). I'll give that reality shows in general can muck up their stars' credibility or image (The Bad.) I'll also give that the episode where Jackie cattily snickered about a client's cleavage was disappointing (The Ugly).

In protest, and becasuse I'd heard good things, I tried Jillian Michaels's ""30 Day Shred""--but found her Level 2 style a tad abrasive and belittling. (If her routines are going to torment me physically, don't need to augment that with low self-esteem because I can't keep up with her grueling routines or burn that stubborn fat. Found myself cussing back at her on the TV...)!

So I revisited Jackie Warner's ""Workout: One-on-One Training."" Figured with a successful Beverly Hills fitness club and a rock-hard body at 40 (that my sister enviously insists is from surgery because no one over 35 looks that good without it), Jackie must be doing something right. I started with the 20-minute Core routine every morning, with the Upper-Body routine every other morning. (As mentioned in other reviews--there are three 20-min. workouts--core, upper body, lower body. I have lower-back and knee issues, so I shy away from high-impact lower-body routines.)

Bottom line:  It works!

In 6 months:  lost 8 lbs, 3"" from waist, 2"" from hips, 4"" from ribcage, arms and abs more sculpted than 2 decades of health club. 6 months later, I still burn (adding ankle weights and a balancing disc for core + increasing weights for upper body keeps it effective.)

PROS: Schedule flexibility (quick 20 minutes daily, or all 60 3x/week); includes warm-up and cooldown stretches + beginning/advanced modifications; motivating, personable coaching (Jackie is encouraging, but sometimes forgets to address her at-home viewer-clients); fairly good job emphasizing good form throughout DVD; includes 1-minute cardio-burst moves (more effective than just the routines--just don't expect it to be a substitute for cardio workout--it isn't).

CONS: Moves fast, lack of clear instruction from one routine to next (example: stands up between modified plank and bicycles--both floor routines, so keep the remote pause/rewind handy until you learn the routines); doesn't emphasize good core form throughout core routine (i.e., press belly inward to spine, spine into floor); some routines change timing/don't keep time w/music; severe lower-back strain with some upper-body moves where you bend over with weights (bent-over rows, rear-delt flys, alternating one-arm row--try over exercise ball or bedside/sofaside to support lower back).

RECOMMENED? Absolutely! (Esp. for beginners/intermediate fitness-seekers.)",1227225600,7,2881,5.439461883408072

3144074,2,B0015D20FY,"I've never seen an episode of ""Work Out"" but I was looking for a good interval training DVD with weights and thought this one work do the trick.

Pros:

I like that you can break the video up into Arms/Legs/Abs. Even though I prefer working large and small muscles at the same time. It's nice to be able to work just one area at a time.

Cons:

There are too many trainers just sitting around during the workout. I think it would have been nice if at least one of them was demonstrating alternate ways to do the exercise for the viewer.

On my HD television, you can see the makeup that one of the trainers is wearing on her abs quite clearly and, in general, the porny baby voiced trainers do nothing for me. Since I don't watch the show, I'm wondering if this is really the best Sky Gym has to present.

Jackie is an average to mediocre coach. She doesn't cue well, engages in annoying chit chat with her trainers, and doesn't point out form in a way that is useful for the viewer. Also, there is very little explanation of the moves before the trainer begins doing them.

The upper body workout was good with some unique moves but the lower body workout was really lacking IMO. I didn't feel like I got a good workout after completing it.

I can't help but compare this DVD to Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred because both are well known TV trainers with great bodies that seem to make all the ladies swoon. Also, both DVDs are shot on the exact same set.

Of the two, I prefer ""30 Day Shred."" After checking both out from the library, it is the one I ended up buying.",1226102400,70,1569,4.255892255892256

I found that the upper and lower body sections were good, but not as advanced as I would have liked.  That being said, she did throw in some new moves I've never seen before so it's definitely great for variety.  The core section on the other hand was TOUGH.  It may have been the same intensity as the other 2 sections, but that's my weakest area so I really felt this one.  I saw a couple of reviews complaining about the lack of real cardio.  This is a toning DVD with a little cardio thrown in to give you a little break from the strength training.  Don't buy this if you're looking for a cardio workout.  I reccommend it though if you're looking to do some toning.

EDIT: I wrote this review the morning I did the lower body workout.  It is now the next day and I am majorly feeling this workout.  I would change my rating to 5 Stars.",1225843200,,985,4.099476439790576

Each segment is 20 minutes and the 20 minutes always fly by! Jackie and her fellow trainers are energetic and do a great job of motivating you to keep going.

When you first do it you will be very sore the next day but it feels good to know you are working muscles that you normally don't.  It's very fast paced and goes by quickly and you will work up a good sweat.  Love that each section is just 20 minutes.  Jackie says you should do it 3x a week or one section per day.  I'm working up to the 3x a week.  The abs/core section has one trainer showing you a modified less difficult version and one trainer showing a more advanced version.  It's great though cause you can always increase or lower the intensity by increasing  or lowering your weights.  If you like working out at home this is a great DVD for that.

She then goes through several moves with 1 trainer at a time (except for the core portion), commenting on form and other elements of the exercise.  The moves are then followed by a brief cardio portion (2 minutes).  The cardio ranges from ski bunnies to jumping jacks to jabs.

Overall, its a good video, although I expected more from it.  I know on the show, Jackie does say she didn't prepare enough for this video & it definately shows.  Still, it is a good beginning video, and I found the abs portion to be pretty challenging.",1221609600,,732,4.584615384615384

The 20 minute sections make it possible to do one or all--time and ability being a factor.  I've ordered 15 DVD's in the past two weeks and most of them are high impact and totally disregard knee, hip and back problems caused by high impact.  Jackie is right on with no time wasted and easy to follow directives.  Can't wait to see what she comes out with next. J Lang",1221264000,2,632,4.413793103448276

I also love that it is segmented into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Core, and that you can do one at a time or combine them any way you like.  That is a great feature for people who may only have a short time for working out and who like to rotate which body parts they strengthen on each day.

This is sort of unrelated to the quality of the workouts, but being a fan of the show, I like watching the interplay between Jackie and her staff.  I feel almost like I'm working out with friends.  Really, really, really fit friends.

3144093,5,B0015D20FY,Perfect DVD.  This is not a silly workout like some DVDs.  It is intense but realistic.  It is like having your own personal trainer the way the workout is presented.  I am a runner and this workout has definitely made me a stronger runner.,1219795200,,240,4.386363636363637
3144094,4,B0015D20FY,"I love the core and upper-body segments.  Jackie is great at reminding you to pay attention to form.  The lower-body segment moves pretty fast, so I'd recommend that newbies practice correct lunge form before beginning the segment.  Each segment transitions between a series of one-minute exercises followed by a cardio boost exercise, so you'll always be feeling the burn in one muscle group or another.  I'd recommend this video to friends.",1218931200,,442,5.183098591549296
3144095,5,B0015D20FY,This workout is right down to business.  Jackie really works you hard with easy to follow exercises and modifications.  No fancy dance steps just a real intense workout!,1218844800,,169,5.0
3144096,5,B0015D20FY,"I really liked the upper body segment. Jackie and one other trainter (they took turns) would do the moves and focus on detail. It helped it go by superfast!

Then the Abs segment was different. Everyone did it all together. It was a really good workout! I'm pretty sure I couldn't do all three segments in onw day. I started the lower body and my legs were burning so much I had to stop!",1218758400,,387,4.22972972972973
3144097,4,B0015D20FY,"I love this video!  I watched her reality show and saw the taping of it...then found it on demand through my local cable company.  I started doing all three segments (core, lower and upper) every other day, while running on the other days (2-3 times per week). I saw dramatic change and felt so much better very quickly.  I bought the DVD to ensure I can continue if its not on demand anymore.  The  ONLY reason I gave it 4 instead of 5, is there are a few confusing cues and directions along the way.  In the upper portion...she states several times that you either ""should never lean back on these exercises"" or ""should never lean forward"".  A little confusing, which would be even worse if someone were new to this type of exercise. Also, it would be nice to see a ""real"" person in her video...not a professional trainer who has never had children.  But, overall this video rocks!",1218067200,,883,4.475

3144101,5,B0015D20FY,"I've done the three workouts featured on this DVD though On-Demand's Exercise TV.  To build on what other reviewers have said, these are just really effective, doable workouts that offer modifications for people at every level of fitness.  I love Jackie's manner in these workouts, and really feel encouraged when she's telling ""me"" that I can do it.  (Normally I curse instructors under my breath while I'm exercising, so this is a sign that she's pretty effective in providing motivation!)

Many of the exercises featured in these workouts can also be found in other programs, so they're obviously considered effective.  I was definitely sore in the beginning, though in time my body has adjusted to the workouts.  My solution is to take a week or two off of Jackie's workouts, trying something like dance or other whole body exercise programs.  When I get back into Jackie mode, especially the upper body, I'm hurting all over again.  -The good hurt that makes you want to show people your muscles!  I've recommended this to friends and family, and everyone agrees that it's a great and effective workout.",1217548800,,1108,4.945945945945946

3144103,5,B0015D20FY,"Love this work out DVD! I like Jackie's show Work Out and it makes it fun to feel like you ""know"" the people from her show and they are working out with you.

You get different levels to choose from when working out by following one of the instructors.

Jackie makes it fun. She mixes up your work out with boxing, aerobics, and other different types of exercise.

I learned some new exercise moves with this DVD. I like that as the same old same old can get boring. You feel special working out with this group as they are located in the exclusive Beverly Hills and people pay an astronomical price to work out with them. You are getting all of the ""secrets"" for a VERY reasonable price.

I am a freelance writer on Associated Content and I wrote in detail about this DVD. I give it 5 stars~! Get working out now with Jackie!",1217289600,,826,4.2756410256410255

3144105,4,B0015D20FY,"This is a great video for toning but not so much for cardio.  I like it because you can choose to do just lower body, upper body or abs (20 min each) or you can do any combo of the 3.  I was pleasantly sore after doing the whole workout and she does excercises that aren't your run of the mill excercises so you feel it in different areas.",1217116800,,339,3.898550724637681
3144106,5,B0015D20FY,"I first used this workout on my cable on Demand.  I was very impressed.  The core workout is awesome, you definitely feel it.  Then I tried the lower boby and that felt great.  Lots of lunges and Squats which are very effective.  I liked that workout so much I decided to try the upper body the same morning.  I used about 5 to 8 lb.  weights. she covers all the chest, back and arm groups.  What I Like best about all of these is that Jackie puts cardio in about every three ot four minutes.  Quick little bursts of cardio definitely keep your heart rate going.  I feel like I get a good mix of strength training and cardio.  I would reccomend to anyone who wants an effective workout but doesn't have half the morning to get it done!

3144108,4,B0015D20FY,"THE GOOD: The workout is good and tough but definitely not for a beginner.  The set up is pretty simple, and every exercise is done for 1 minute, you get 20 min of non-stop upperbody, 20 of lower and 20 of abs which are divided into different chapters so you can choose to do all 3 or select the part you want to work on that day.  Also, the workouts cover all of your muscle groups.

THE BAD: Although there are modifications for some of the exercises you would still have to understand good form to make sure you execute them correctly - most of the instructions she gives are pretty quick.  The painted-on abs is pretty cheesy and the 'team work' attitude was so fake.

Aside from that I think it's a good workout for a very reasonal price.  Enjoy!",1216857600,,751,4.290780141843972

This one I do not, I love the workouts are 20 min apiece you can do the full body for 60 min or upper,lower,and core separately I also really like Jackie's direction and cuing. The exercises have a different spin to them ,but are easy to master I am 43 and find the workout very effective.",1216771200,,444,4.235294117647059

It's broken into 3 separate 20 minute workouts (which all include a warm up & stretch) upper body, lower body, and core.  The dvd has a feature that allows you to choose which one, or two, or you can do all three... IF you can handle it.  I work out regularly, and I couldn't do all three in one viewing (I tried).  But, to get myself motivated for the day, I chose one workout, and then I go for a jog and walk around the neighborhood for more cardio.  I do this 3 days a week, one day for each of her workouts, and the other 2 days I weight train with kettlebells. I highly suggest this DVD to compliment any workout routine!",1216512000,,725,3.9315068493150687

The only problem I have with the DVD is the instructor, Jackie.  I don't like to say it, but she comes across as a very annoying person/personality.  I know that is kind of petty, so overall I would say that the DVD is a good addition to a person's fitness routine.",1216252800,3,400,4.364864864864865

Each workout is only 20 mins which is great when you don't have a lot of time to exercise.  I have been using the DVD for 3 weeks now and can see a big difference already.  I have and will continue to recommend this DVD to others looking to get in shape.,1216252800,,370,3.8933333333333335

Her instructions are very clear and she helps you keep focus on your form while also encouraging you to hang in there!

3144122,5,B0015D20FY,I work out several times a week and this video kicks my butt.  My boyfriend is a fitness freak and the ab workout kills him as well.  The video has various levels of strength incorporated so you can make the workout fit your own personal level.  I love it.  It's a great video to have if some days you just don't have the motivation to leave your house for the gym.  Because you can get just as good a workout (or even better) right at home.,1215907200,,441,4.0813953488372094

This DVD workout will leave you sore, but motivated. It's very simple and gets right to the point - each 20 minute section works one part of your body (upper, lower, core/abs) very efficiently. I like that part because I don't have much time to work out, so I want to be able to target a specific part of my body, raise my heart rate, and then be able to do a different part the next day. There are also modifications on most of the exercises for people who, like me, haven't done much working out in the past and are not in super great shape.

It's designed in such a way that even the less fit person can modify the routines in a way that they still receive a benefit. It's broken down into three muscle groups. There is an upper body work out, a core work out and a lower work out. Jackie focuses on the form of each exercise, first demonstrating it, and then using a trainer's form to illustrate. When she tells you which muscle each movement is designed to address, there isn't any doubt as evidenced by the burn you feel. Each exercise is then shown in it's modified or increased intensity form. I couldn't be happier with this DVD and am well on my way to becoming more fit.",1215475200,,726,4.425373134328358

One thing that challenged me was keeping up with the cardio in the lower body work out. If it got tought, I resolved to marching in place just to keep from stopping.

Overall, the upper body work out was my favorite, really worked the triceps and those are hard to reach.

This dvd does everything right: the exercises are really effective (you feel them!), you break a sweat, and there's modifications for beginners and advanced viewers.  The 3 20-minute segments are great because you can program however many segments you want to do.  Jackie is a great teacher because she motivates you but isn't cheesy, hyper, or annoying.

3144152,5,B0015D20FY,"As a fan of Jackie's Work Out series, I was looking forward to getting a taste of what it is she actually does.  And I'm not disappointed.

I would recommend this workout to any beginner or intermediate excerciser because Jackie does a great job of explaining the form and technique for each excercise.  And as someone who still has trouble perfecting the proper form of a squat, I really appreciate it.  She's also enthusiastic without being annoyingly perky.  Same with her trainers.  Each of her 4 trainers is featured during every workout and they are very likeable without being annoying.  Also, if you watch the show, you will recognize a few of their personality traits emerging (especially Rebecca) as they workout with Jackie.

The workouts are grouped into 3 separate areas, upper body, lower body, and core.  You can build your own workout in whatever combination you like.  Each is 20 minutes long, which for me is the perfect amount of time to get in some strength training during the day.  You need minimal equipment -- just handweights.  I've done each workout so far, and I plan on continuing until it bores me (as all workouts eventually do).  Still, this one was under $10 bucks when I bought it from Amazon, and it is well worth the money, even if I tire of it in a a few months.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1214870400,,1331,4.608510638297872

3144155,4,B0015D20FY,"I really have liked this video.  Having watched the Bravo! series with Jackie Warner, I was interested in trying the work-out video that she and her trainers put together.  Just like the show, Jackie has a good approach and style - she pushes you, and stays on track, but she is encouraging.  I like the modified Core work-out too as some of the harder exercises are hard on the back.  The video at times seems a little thrown together and slightly unprofessional, but not a big deal.  I like the break-out into 3 different routines.  My favorite is the Core.  I think if I stick with it religiously I may obtain those elusive 6-pack abs someday!",1214524800,,646,4.517241379310345

3144157,5,B0015D20FY,"I love this workout. One segment, only 20 minutes long gave me sore muscles. It's easy for beginners to do and will definitely benefit advanced.

Before I bought this I thought it only had strength training but was happy to find out it had cardio and strength.  It moves at a fast pace and I like that you don't do too much of one thing, it keeps moving.  Right about when you think you can't do anymore, your done.  I must mention that I am VERY out of shape and I could only make it through the upper body segment and a small part of lower body on my first try but I am eager to try again because it was actually kind of fun.  Time went by fast while doing this.  Jackie really mixes it up so you don't get bored.  I like the core segment- She gives lots of alternative ways to work your middle other than boring crunches-which I hate.  I like that when Jackie says your almost there, you actually are almost there.  Nothing more annoying than trainers who tease you. Note to those trainers:  It is not motivating and only makes me want to quit.",1214352000,,1032,4.0594059405940595

And boy was I surprised by the utterly low price been offered by Amazon so of course I ordered it along with Jillian Michael's 30 day shred. Even though I am not overly impressed with the 30 day shred due in large part to Ms. Michael's amazingly dull and annoying personality I can say the complete opposite of Jackie. Her motivational spirit which is already evident from the show and her patient yet informative way of training is definitely one to be desired. In short I would recommend this to everyone, it is a great workout in a short amount of time without the usual boredom of a lot of other workout tapes (trust me I own quite a lot). Bravo! Jackie on a job very well done.",1214352000,,929,4.375722543352601

Seeing the other familiar faces was great too.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. What a great idea for her.  Thanks.,1214265600,,428,4.275
3144172,5,B0015D20FY,"Jackie Warner was born in 1969 in Fairborn, Ohio. She's a fitness trainer  and owner of Sky Sport and Spa in Beverly Hills, California.

For those of you who have never seen her, she rocks. Nearly forty, she looks great. And she knows how to train people. In fact, she trains stars in Hollywood.

I love this video. Jackie has an engaging personality that makes you want to push yourself and enjoy what you're doing.

I timed each session and they run true to what they say . . . twenty minutes each.

The instructors consist of Jackie, three of her female trainers and one of her male trainer.

The video starts off with a short promo for her show on Bravo. That's okay as the video isn't expensive. But when you pay for something, I prefer not to pay for an advertisement. It's short, however. You may not even notice it.

The upper body is high reps and lighter weights. I'm used to heavy weights and low reps. But this is better for older people and it's great toning and cardio. If you want to go for muscle mass, you'll have to go another route.

This is really fast-paced. But the exercises are broken up in minutes. So you don't get overly tired. At the same time, you burn fat and get toned.

The music is good for working out. It's not too loud but you're aware of it. It keeps good time to the workout.

Jackie gives good instruction. She is, after all, a true expert at getting people into shape.

This is not a girlie girl workout. No aerobics. I like that. There are a few jumping jacks and military-like cardio moves; some boxing moves. These are great and done in short spurts.

Jackie tells which muscles are being engaged in each exercise.

Each workout ends with a stretch, which is really necessary and good. It's a great cool down and allows your heart rate to go down and muscles to relax.

Some instructors have you stretch before the workout with weights. I'm not sure which is best. But I prefer to do it afterwords.

The only equipment you need is a mat and your choice of dumbbells. You'll want the weights to be light enough to use for one minute or so for each exercise but heavy enough to tone. So it totally depends on your current strength. You might hurt yourself if you go too heavy. So it's better to go lighter than you think you need until you do the workout at least one time.

The important thing is, you'll burn fat and tone up.

The video is broken up into three twenty-minute workouts. The first one is for the upper body. The second one is for the lower body and the third is for the abs and core.

Twenty minutes isn't a long time. But you'll know you've had a workout after any one of these. Of course, those brave and hardy souls who just have to go gung ho can do more than one session if they choose.

One thing I like about the lower body workout is that the lunges are not deep so they're easy on the knees. After the warm up there are sixty second squats. These really work the gluts, hamstrings and quads.

Then you'll do a front lunge. Again, you don't need to go deep. And, you can add weights for extra resistance if you want. Advanced exercisers will probably want to.

This is really a full body workout.

Jackie tells you how to keep your posture, your form. Jackie says on the video that you'll want to increase your weights as you do the workouts more often.

You'll get cardio in the lower body workout too. Between the weight sessions is a short period of fast cardio. Generally boxing and jumping routines.

You'll engage your abs in most of the exercises.

""You can do anything for a minute,"" Jackie tells the viewer. And that's true.

I suggest you watch the video before you do any of the workouts. That way you'll know where you might want to modify.

The lower body workout, like the previous one, ends with a stretch. A few of the poses are wonderful yoga poses, such as the child's pose. Then, you go into the pigeon, another wonderful yoga pose and it feels so good.

The ab/core session begins with a nice warm up. Then, Jackie leads the team in crunches. Here I have a minor problem. Jackie has been quoted as saying she did not do crunches. She has fantastic abs to be sure. But her claim is she does not do crunches herself.

To quote Jackie herself, ""I actually do not do crunches. This is one of my buzz phrases, `Crunches are a waste of time.'

She continues, ""Crunches are not going to get those abs. How you get those abs are actually lifting with a big muscle group such as chest, back, legs and butt. The more muscle that you have on your frame, the more fat you literally lose or shrink.""

But, in all honesty, this video has only a few crunches. The rest of the ad/core workout uses such things as the plank and twist.

I've found that most all weight lifting and body work uses the abs. And strong abs are important. There just not for looks. You need them to lift groceries, the baby and even to reach things on high shelves. Notice sometime when you do these things . . . you'll feel your abs if you have good strong ones.

I judge the core/ab workout as excellent. It combines yoga poses with some really tough exercises and they really engage the abs. You'll also get cardio. You'll get the burn. And you'll burn fat and build muscle.

Of course, this session, like all of the others, ends in a nice stretch session.

The ab work is very effective and it works.

I rate this 5 stars. It's terrific for any level except hard core weight lifters. And it's good for men and women both although I expect more women will want this video.

It's not aerobic. It's a real workout and I believe you'll get real results if you do it.

Highly recommended.

3144173,4,B0015D20FY,"This workout tape is split into three 20-minute routines; one for upper body; another for lower body and one for abdominals/core.  Each routine is very intense.  I think that overall this is a good workout tape, however, some of the exercises are done too fast.  For example on the lower body workout, they do a series of front and backward split lunges.  To do these properly and without hurting yourself, you need to concentrate on form, not speed.  I don't think Jackie does much to emphasize form over speed and therefore, this is definitely not for the out of shape or beginner exerciser.",1214179200,3,593,4.718446601941747

3144178,5,B0015D20FY,"I worked with a personal trainer for two months in the past and of the three weight training DVDs I've tried so far, this is the closest I've come to having that personal trainer again. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-Fitness-System-Personal-Training/dp/B000E8N5E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention Fitness System - Personal Training</a>&nbsp;DVD was the first I tried. The exercise was easy and it made me sore the first time I tried at (after a couple years of not working out on a regular basis and some pounds gained), but the second time didn't really do much for me. Next I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Biggest-Loser-Workout-Power-Sculpt/dp/B000WEVGHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Biggest Loser Workout: Power Sculpt</a>&nbsp;DVD and that was better than the first DVD, but still not terribly challenging either during the workout or in soreness afterwards.

I tried this DVD last night, and let me tell you, I couldn't keep up! I had to pause the DVD a couple times to walk around and catch my breath, and sometimes I could not keep up for the full minute during the workout because of the burning. This was mostly with the modified version of the workouts. Despite the toughness, you do get a better workout because Jackie is very encouraging and motivating. She would frequently tell the home viewers that they could do it and to keep going, almost done, keep going even if you can't reach as high or go slower than the trainer in the video, and so on. I was definitely sore today from that workout in most of my body(biceps, triceps, quads, delts, traps, etc). It's also great because over time I can switch from the modified version to the normal version, and for some workouts, the advanced version. I can also increase the weights I use to increase the toughness.

I'm very happy I found this DVD because I found something that is challenging to do during the workout, it made me sore afterwards so I know I'm growing muscles, and I know I will be able to make the workouts tougher for myself as I get in better shape over time. And best of all - I don't need to pay a trainer $xx/hour for it and a gym $xx/month, just the one-time cost of the DVD and a couple weights & pad I already owned. :)",1213747200,2,2331,5.147757255936676

Good for the MONEY  There were a few excercises in there that i Had never seen before.  and You Do SWEAT, and it does target Muscles..  What I Liked about it was You could Keep Up, and Not get Lost in fancy footwork type stuff, as a Lot cardio DVD 's do to me.. Id say for the MONEY ........its worth it.

3144190,5,B0015D20FY,"This is a tough workout.  I exercise with weights regularly, and I was sore the next day in ways I haven't been in a while!  These workouts are short, but they are non-stop and packed with different exercises.  The 20 minutes (or so) goes by fast because there are no breaks at all - you do two or three weight lifting exercises and then go into a minute of cardio.  Most of the weight lifting exercises are a minute of each type (for example, one minute of squats, then one minute of lunges).  The exercises are basic enough, so you don't have to be an expert to do them, but you do have to work out regularly to keep up, as well as to know which weights to use with each exercise, since they don't offer advice on this (light vs. heavier, etc.).

The only minor problems I have are with the warm-up/cool-downs and the form of some of the trainers.  The warm-up and cool-downs are very short, so it would probably be wise to do a little more of each on your own.  Also, sometimes the trainers are doing the exercises so fast they they jerk around and appear to use bad form.  For example, one of the girls is doing squats so fast that she's basically popping up and locking her knees at the top - from what I've learned on other videos, this is bad.  Since I know proper form, this isn't a problem for me, but it could be bad for people who are new to these types of exercises.

I like the option to break the workout up if I only have time to do one or two sequences. I always see a difference in my shape the day after doing this video.

As a 50+ woman who was very athletic in her younger years, I have stayed active through various activities including yoga, pilates & dance. I have good weight & muscle tone but needed a little more to fight the ""hormonal change pooch"" & keep my bones strong. The weight training helps keep bones healthy & this workout sure burns off fat! That little layer forming that awful ""pooch"" is melting off nicely. After only 10 days, both hubby & myself can see a noticible difference. I definitely work up a sweat & feel the burn but really feel great afterward. I truly enjoy Jackie's workout & her training style. Although this is not an advanced workout it IS challenging & beginners should definitely modify when they first start to avoid injury.

It's got mods up (watch Jesse) or down (watch Renessa) to help you tailor it to your strengths or weaknesses for individual exercises ... I can do some well, others less so, but I can do the whole deal because of the mods. It's a great workout, with engaging (but not overpowering) music, good cuing, and professional production.

I'm also puzzled by the comparisons to Jillian Michaels. Nothing against her, but her style turns me off. Jackie comes across as wanting you to succeed, and offers a way to get there, but doesn't let you forget why you're doing this in the first place!

I've bought so many disappointing exercise DVDs -- either way too hard or way too easy, or too long, or not something you could really keep doing for the long haul. You can make this DVD into what works for you with the three 20-minute mix-and-match sessions, and the mods make it easy to get started at almost any level, and move onward from there.

This is the first exercise DVD I've found that I'll actually be able to use on an on-going basis. Very good value -- don't hesitate to buy it!",1212883200,14,1222,4.520361990950226

I liked how the segments are divided up and on the main menu you can select the videos that you want to perform, meaning if you want to do just legs and core, you highlight both and when it plays, it leads one segment into the next.

Overall this is more like the boot camp style workout that Jackie talks about on her show.  It has made a nice addition to my other workouts to shake things up a bit.  You will feel it the next day.  The 20minute segments make it great to fit in on those days when you don't have that much time to fit into an entire workout.",1212796800,,659,4.030769230769231

Jackie is really good about explaining which muscles you are working out with each exercise. Although this may be a bit difficult for a beginner, don't give up its worth it.

I have NEVER been able to force myself through an entire workout video due to boredom, but Jackie's program has incredible variation and the one-on-one style of the upper and lower body segments simply make the workout FLY by.

For those who are complaining about a lack of cardio in the workout, I recommend wearing a heart rate monitor, especially during the lower body segment. I have found that this workout keeps my heart rate relatively high - only about 10-15 points below my avg while running.

3144206,4,B0015D20FY,"I bought this after wanting a piece of the show at my home to work out with. I consider myself to be in decent health and I work out often but this is the first ""conventional"" work out I have ever done. The routines are hard but since each movement is only 1 minute, it doesn't feel so bad. Actually, during the entire work out (60 min), I didn't feel winded or anything. But afterwards when I was finished I could really FEEL every muscle in my stomach and my hips, which felt amazing! AND while doing the dvd, it didn't even feel like it took a hour. I felt like I was only doing it for 20 minutes..which is great...it moves very smoothly and keeps your attention.

I gave this four stars only because I think the airbrushed abs for definition on the trainers is cheesy and unnecessary. However, this does not take away from the quality of the work out. I only recommend that if you need constant motivation to keep going and need a trainer to hold your hand, you might want another video. Jackie does a good job of motivating you but it isn't the first thing she says in a given segment. This is okay because I can keep myself motivated, but if you can't look elsewhere.",1212537600,9,1173,4.283783783783784

I am 49 years old, and intermediate-to-advanced.  Whenever I try a new workout, it's usually either too easy or frustratingly difficult.  This was perfect!  And the bonus was, even though I workout 3-4 days a week, I was sore in several places the next day!  Wow!  That doesn't happen too much anymore.  I tried it the second time yesterday, and today I am only sore due to the pushups.  But I still really was impressed with the workout.  She gets the job done!  I will say, after viewing other's comments, I have to agree that her trainers' abs certainly do look enhanced with some type of shading.  They are fit enough that I find that insulting to both them and us.  But as far as the workout itself goes, I highly recommend this to anyone.  Beginners can do fewer reps, lighter weights, or do one section at a time.  Advanced can increase weights and do the more advanced modifications she shows.  I look forward to trying some of those as I improve.",1212451200,8,1130,4.3768115942028984

My goal is to break the workout up into three workouts that way I am exercising a different area a different day. I walk and play DDR on playstation in workout mode daily.

While I understand what makes someone like or dislike an exercise video is very subjective, it was hard for me to see how someone could *hate* the exercises in this video.  The only thing that I could conclude is that some of the reviews are actually reflecting the reviewer's personal thoughts on the trainer. I'm more interested in the quality of the work-out in the video.  In that regard, I can say that I really like this DVD.  For me to stick with a DVD I need variation and this DVD delivers that.  There are three segments so I can do a different one each morning.  At first I didn't think I'd like the fact that for the upper body and lower body segments she works with one trainer at a time but this wound up being my favorite feature of the video.  There are four trainers so I knew that after the second trainer, I was at the half way point - this helped me push through the segments.",1212019200,44,1019,4.331578947368421
3144211,5,B0015D20FY,"I got both Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred and this DVD. Both I feel are effective workouts. I'm a beginner exerciser so I was a little concerned reading the reports that my arms would fall off and I wouldn't be able to move the next day. I walk 50 minutes to get to my schools to teach and I worked it just fine. In fact I even felt better than I usually do. You'll definitely feel the burn though. The only bad thing I can say about Jackie was that I didn't feel as motivated by her. Jillian's ""Work for it! This butt doesn't come for free! Keep pushing! Go deeper now!"" and other phrases actually pumped me up though if I hadn't been working out I probably would have just rolled my eyes. Jackie's relationship with her trainers is more evident and she seems to really motivate them so you're kind of motivated through proxy but it definitely doesn't have the same feeling. Her moves really work though and her energy and focus on good form are good. I'll edit and repost if my feelings change but that's the word for now.",1211932800,6,1024,4.310880829015544

All the workouts are great, they are not boring at all, they mix it all up and they do everything in short increments so you don't get to wiped out from doing the same thing over and over. There is a reason Jackie Warner gets paid so well for being a trainer and its not just because she has a TV show it's because she really is an amazing trainer.

3144214,5,B0015D20FY,"I bought this on a whim. Having seen a few episodes of the Workout series and seeing that it was only $10 I found it to be a good deal. So when I popped it in yesterday I was amazed at how quick yet effective each workout is. Jackie's motto of ""you can do anything for one minute"" really seems strangely motivational. She doesn't yell during the home video like some other trainers, which is a big plus. Her attitude is more ""you can do it"" than ""you better do it while I yell at you to do it longer!"" It is very refreshing. Jackie also points out where you should be feeling the burn in every single exercise, making it easy to determine that you are doing the exercise properly. In addition to being an intermediate level video (which is really difficult to find!) she shows how to progressively make the exercises more difficult, along with doing them for a long period of time.
Really, Jackie's ""you can do anything for a minute"" attitude combined with her knowledge about the body makes for a great video. This is the best $10 I've spent in a while!",1211846400,15,1054,4.355329949238579
3144215,5,B0015D20FY,"This is one of the best workout DVD's I have ever tried.  It is broken down into three twenty minute workouts consisting of the upper body, lower body, and the core.  This is a great idea. Many people complain that they don't have time to workout because most workout videos are about 45 -60 minutes long (some longer!).  This makes it really intimidating when you are trying to start exercising, or if it has been a while since you have had an exercise routine.  But with this DVD, it is hard to find an excuse not to exercise for twenty minutes a day.  And for those of you who workout regularly, you can do all three workouts at a time.

As for each of the three workouts, they are all intense.  Jackie definitely makes each second count.  You get in, get your workout, get out and get on with your day.  I have only been doing this workout for the last four days, but I have already had my energy level shoot up.  I seem to get a lot more done.  I had just recently started working out again, so I have only been doing one of the workouts a day.  I started with the upper body workout.  I have been working out with weights, and thought I was doing pretty well.  But the day after doing this workout, I was sore in muscles I completely forgot I had.  Not so sore that I was useless, but sore enough to remember I had worked out the day before.  The next day I did the lower body workout, and boy was that intense.  There were some moves I had not seen before that really seemed to target the inner thigh.  I was not able to go as deep into every move as the trainers did, but I still felt it the next day.  And of course I did the core workout the next morning.  I definitely had to do the modified version on some moves, but I still reached muscles that have not been worked in years.

I have to say again how much I am enjoying this workout DVD.  It targets every muscle group, and since it is so fast-paced you do get a cardio workout as well.  I find Jackie and her trainers to be highly motivational.  They are all friendly and inspiring.  I will definitely be using this DVD as my main exercise.  Thanks so much Jackie!!",1211673600,9,2130,4.146699266503667

3144217,4,B0015D20FY,"The good thing about this workout dvd is there are three 20 minute segments and each segment targets a different part of your body: upper, core and lower. So you can do one at a time or all of them if you want a longer routine.

20 minutes is good because it's short. But it is intense- Jackie utalizes every second in each routine going from exercise to exercise quickly so you get some cardio in as well as strength training.

The other good thing about this dvd is her trainers show you different variations of all the moves so whether you are a beginner or more advanced you can do each move on your own level.

I do this with Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and the results I'm getting with them is amazing. The main thing with exercise and being successful is you have to stay consistent and don't expect miracle results. Results will come if you continue, don't even give up and be patient. If you do an exercise routine and only give 50%, you will only get 50% results. You get what you put in.",1211500800,9,1001,4.285714285714286
3144218,5,B0015D20FY,"I began exercising regularly about six months ago, alternating resistance training with cardio work and yoga. I do not belong to a gym and so rely largely on video workouts. My favorites are the Biggest Loser series, Jillian Michaels routines, and a DVD called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Every-Body-With-Over-35-Routines/dp/B00006RCNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Every Body (With Over 35 Routines)</a>. I've lost over twenty pounds and am now  at a healthy weight and can really see the results. I no longer get winded like I used to and am starting to see some great muscle definition.

I can't say enough about how much I like Jackie Warner's new video. One of my favorite things about it is that she has broken down the three routines into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs. So you can alternate days thus giving your muscles time to rest and repair. This is a HUGE draw to me. Each routine is about 21.5 minutes including the warm up and cool down. The warm ups and cool downs are also uniquely designed for each specific workout.

The exercises are quite varied and you feel like you're getting a thorough workout. They are mostly strength training with some cardio interspersed throughout. She also gives you modifications to make the exercises easier or more challenging.

Throughout the routines, Jackie's great about telling you exactly which muscles you're working, why you're working them, and where you should  feel the exercise. Her attention to form is excellent which is so important when you're working out on your own at home and don't have anyone to tell you if you're doing an exercise properly.

This video is definitely going to be a staple in my exercise repertoire. I hope there are more to come because this is exactly what I want in an exercise DVD!",1211414400,10,1837,5.147651006711409

i've reviewed and tried a lot of workouts and workout programs, and this one is the best because it is highly effective and efficient.

she chooses an excellent group of exercises for each area of the body and gives you a tough workout that hits every muscle deeply. however, it's easy to modify for a beginner. just do few reps. on the toughest.

there is no waste of time or effort with too many exercises or exercise combinations that leave you feeling as if some muscles were left out. the warm-ups are quick and easy, and the stretches at the end are also quick and feel good.

what i liked best is that she works your inner thighs with squat and lunge variations that are a lot more pleasant than those old exercises on your side on the floor - and i felt those muscles during the session and the next day.

in fact, the next day, (after doing all three sections at once and modifying as needed), i did not have much soreness, was standing taller, and my abs were pulled in.",1211155200,5,1022,4.414893617021277

This is a body targeted workout that uses interval training to get it done.  There are three programs and they each focus on different body parts; upper body, lower body and abs.  Each are fairly tough going but very effective.  I've done this twice already and I'm as sore the second time as the first.  I enjoy it though and have fun doing it which is the main thing because it's making me want to do it again.  All you need are some dumbells and some space and almost anyone can do it.

I burned 170 calories in 20 min doing the lower body portion.  I love all 3 workouts.  They all have some different moves in them and also spurts of cardio that help to burn lots of calories.  I would highly recommend.  Jackie is so much better than Jillian.  I would take Jackie over her any day.

I have increased my weights up from 3 pounds to 8 pounds on many of the exercises (biceps, chest etc) and I am finding the workout is easy for me now.

3378253,5,B0015D20FY,"This is an excellent DVD with 3 circuit workouts (each 20 min long) that have a specific focus: Upper Body, Core, Lower Body. It features Jackie Warner with four of her trainers: Jesse, Rebecca, Augustina and Renessa. While the trainers all do the warmup and stretch together, during the weight training Jackie works out one-on-one with one of the individual trainers. She has them do the workout while she gives them pointers on form and motivation, except in the core workout where they all workout together. She is encouraging without being cheesy.

I really like this workout and felt it provided an adequate challenge for the intermediate and perhaps the beginner exerciser who really wants a challenge (as there are some modifications shown). There are some new and interesting moves as well as some old favorites, so you get a great amount of variety .  You do approximately one minute of each weight training exercise and for every 3-4 strength moves you do, there is also 1 minute of a cardio move. It moves at a fast pace but not so fast that you feel intimidated. You'll need light to moderate hand weights and a mat. Come on, you can do anything for a minute! :)

I will give an approximate breakdown of each workout, with the moves performed and the trainer who is actually doing the move while Jackie tells you how to do the move correctly and sometimes shows a modified version. Remember you do 1 minute of each move.

********** Upper Body Workout*********
You start out with a short warm-up with arm circles and boxer twist, then you get into the workout.

>Augustina
 -Bent Over Rows (back)
 -Rear Delt Fly (delts)
 - Cardio (30 sec each): Jumping Jacks & Ski Bunny
>Rebecca
 - Modified PushUp (Chest)
 - Kneeling Kickback (Triceps)
 - Lateral Raise & Front Raise (shoulders) - you alternate between one
  one arm doing the lateral raise and the other lifting to the front.
 - Cardio: Boxer Twist
>Renessa
 - Alternating One Arm Row (back)
 - Hammer Curl (biceps)
 - WV(basically a shoulder raise in a different position)
 - Transverse Fly (shoulders)
 - Cardio (Knee-to-Elbow)
> Jesse
 - Fly & Press (chest)
 - Skull Crusher (triceps)
 - Lateral Raise (shoulders)
 - Military Press (shoulders)
 - Cardio (Speed Bag)
Finally a much deserved cooldown with all the trainers.

********** Core Workout **********
 You start out with a brief workout including core rotations, squat with wood chop, overhead squat. In this workout they all workout together and Jackie mostly goes around and gives excellent form pointers but she does the moves sometimes, too. Renessa shows a modified beginner version of the move and Jesse sometimes shows an advanced version. You do each move for one minute. There are a few stretches interspersed throughout, because your abdominals will be sore.

- Crunches
- Clam (The soles of the feet are together with knees out, as you crunch)
- Plank (you hold it for one minute)
- Cardio: Mountain Climber & Plank Twist (30 sec of each)
- Bicycles
- Figure Eight (while sitting on the floor you lean back slightly and  alternately clap your hands under each leg)
- Side Plank Rotation (30 seconds on each side)
- Cardio: Torso Twist
- Straight Leg Tap
- Scissors
- Penguin Heel Tap (really targets the obliques)
- Cardio: Half Burpees
- V-sit Extend & Flex
- Side Roll
- Plank Variation
- Cardio: Fast Bicycles
Finally, a much deserved stretch.

********** Lower Body Workout *********
You start out with a warmup mainly using a half range of motion: little pulse squats, side lunge, front lunge, backward lunge. Again, you do each of the moves for 60 seconds, and hand weights can be used on most of the exercises.

>Augustina
 - Squat
 - Front Lunge
 - Box Squat
 - Cardio: Frog Hop & Shuffle (30 seconds each)
> Jesse
 - Plie Squat
 - Backward Lunge
 - Drop Step
 - Cardio: Jump Lunge Shuffle & Military KneeUp (30 seconds each)
> Renessa
 - Sumo Squat
 - Front Diagonal Lunges
 - Sumo Squat with Drop Step (the drop step is basically a curtsy squat)
 - Cardio: Knee Up Jog & Squat with Side Kick (30 seconds each)
> Rebecca (this part is done on the ground, so you'll probably need a mat)
 - Bridge
 - Reverse Scissor(lay on your stomach and kick your legs over each other)
 - Three Quarter Kick (similar to a Donkey Kick)- 60 seconds on each side
You finish off with a nice lower body and back stretch.

Overall, you will definitely feel the burn and see results with this one. It is well worth the price and Jackie is a master trainer.",1208649600,451,4491,4.663694267515924

I thought that since it is for ""stars"" it would be a lot more challenging than it was. I have 2 of her other workouts are they are very challenging and I like them a lot. For some reason I found it boring right from the start, not sure why. And what's just as bad or worse are the trainers in the video. The girls seem to be more into themselves and strutting their stuff than to motivate or show much energy. I realize that others really like this one, and I appreciate that...

3378285,5,B0015D20FY,"This is one of my all time favorite videos. Ive used this DVD for almost 5 years.
A complete whole body workout DVD that targets upper body, lower body and core. 20 minutes workout for each session. What I really like about Jackie is her crystal clear style of instruction. Absolutely no nonsense. Each session is mixed with a few short bursts of 1 minute cardio to keep your heart rate up.

You are fully aware of which muscle group you are working on as you follow her video. For me, I know that my upper body is my problem area so I pay extra attention to moves that give me the result I am looking for.

Another thing that makes Jackie stands out from other trainers is that she constantly reminds you the importance of posture. ""Watch your form"" is what Jackie said. ""Form matters"", good form, good results and no injuries. For all workout enthusiasts out there, we all know how poor postures during workout can cause unnecessary injuries. Jackie makes it her mission to keep you check your form throughout the entire routine.
This  workout is hard and yet effective. She has her trainers demonstrate two versions of workout (both high intensity and low intensity). You pick and choose the intensity level base on your energy and fitness needs. Jackie is very motivational and her trainers are so young & cute and vibrant.
Overall, an excellent full body workout DVD, worth every penny.  Good DVD, good result.",1406160000,,1415,4.648

Jackie does a great job explaining the exercises so you can follow along and I like that she shows an easy version and a hard version. *Note* She does actually do crunches. Not a lot and they're not too uncomfortable but I was under the impression this would be 0 crunches.

3378290,5,B0015D20FY,My daughter recommended Jackie for abs workout without crunches. I ordered this DVD at the same time and like it a lot. Other reviewers covered everything very well. So I will just add my recommendation. I like the upper and lower body segments a lot. There are other core programs that I prefer but that does not diminish the value of those offered here. Someone mentioned they could do without the chit chat between Jackie and the trainers. I think she attempts to make this workout seem friendly and sociable and she does a good job.,1403049600,2,536,4.59375

Each exercise only lasts a minute and your on to something else which keeps its fun. There's a nice atmosphere, a well lit background, with happy exercisers to put you in a positive mood. While its tough and you feel burn and sweat, its not so hard thought it feels impossible. You adapt after around 3 weeks and can start increasing your weights.

3378295,2,B0015D20FY,The work out itself is OK. Moderately challenging. I really don't like the people in the video: they aren't dressed to work out and the women have their hair like magazine cover models (long and curled- gimme a break no one works out with glam hair) and they are all way over-acting. I just can't watch it. I have tons of exercise videos so I am used to the usual degree of over-enthusiasm that comes with a produced work out but in this video it is too much.,1397347200,2,459,4.2272727272727275

I'm one of those people who can't do just one video all the time and not start rolling my eyes at hearing the same corny joke over and over again and I like to shock my body with new routines. That being said this DVD is always in my rotation. Jackie is no non-sense, she makes sure you have all three options of beginner, intermediate and advanced and keeps it very do-able by making you do no set longer then 60 seconds. I also like that she tends to tell you what move is going to do what, so if you're killing yourself on a certain squat or press or crunch but then she tells you that's going to solve that certain problem area, it makes it a little easier to suffer through it and get there, at least for me.",1394496000,,755,4.04

It's awesome and I even use it after I've complete my other videos to finish with abs.  If there were anything I wish she'd change in her videos, it's that I wouldn't want her to stop to check form.  Maybe that could be a separate segment on the videos.  When the trainer stops, it makes me want to stop.

I used to be more of a BeachBody DVDs fun (Chalene Johnson's Turbo Fire Drills, Insanity by Shane T, & P90X by Tony Horton) but I was looking for a change and I found it with Jackie's programs.

Its kind of cheesy like all workout videos, but it goes by fast and gets the job done.

I also thought it was weird how the participants sit on balls in the background and watched each other do an exercise. It was just strange.

If the airbrushed abs were gone and all participated in exercise routines I would've given 5 stars. It was the airbrushing that brought it down. Did I say I was annoyed by the airbrushing.....",1375920000,2,494,4.53932584269663
3378321,4,B0015D20FY,"If you are the type of person who is willing to do any exercise for sixty seconds then this workout might impress you. This is a 60 minute workout broken down into three segments. You can do each 20 minute workout separately or put them all together which I did and loved it. You will be working upper body, lower body and core/abs. There are a lot of classic exercises like lunges and sit ups. However nothing gets boring as you only do each exercise for one minute.

The thing I felt most was the abdominal workout which was seriously intense. I had to push myself to get through it. However what I liked about this workout was that I could do nearly every exercise either in the advanced version or the modified version depending on how I was feeling. If you are feeling strong you can really go for it but even if you do the modifications you are still going to get a great workout and feel the burn.

This workout will make you sweat and will push you to your limits. The instructors are all pleasant and very fit. Jackie Warner of course leads the exercises but her instructors do most of the work.

3378323,5,B0015D20FY,"It's rare that I work out at home, but on the occasions where I can't get to the gym I will usually do some kind of weight training at home.  I have used a few other workout DVDs from other trainers, and always found something that annoyed me about them- either they were too scattered and hard to follow, or the intensity was not where I needed it to be.  This DVD is the only one that I have kept and continue to use constantly.  I bought it when it first came out and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  I figure I should review something that I have gotten so much use out of!  My husband will make fun of me because I literally just leave it in our DVD player for extended periods of time.

I love that each exercise is done for 60 seconds, and when Jackie says, ""you can do anything for a minute"", I agree and will push myself to finish!  It is very easy to follow along with because you are not doing any crazy dance moves or flailing around.  You're simply doing one exercise at a time, for one minute each.  It may seem regimented, but I find having that order to the workout helps me to get through it more easily!

The intensity is perfect.  I am in fairly good shape and go to the gym at least 5 days per week, and will still ache for a day or two after doing this DVD.

I love that you can break it up into different body areas- arms, legs, and abs- and either do one by itself or any combination of the three.  I also like that you can decide the order of the body areas that you would like to do the routine in.

Strength training really can change your body shape and is the best form of exercise to help you lose weight quickly, so if you are looking for an excellent workout that will help you to do these things, you should buy this now!",1374451200,4,1765,4.0344827586206895

3378332,3,B0015D20FY,"Pros:
-I like how it is broken down into upper/lower/abs, and the workouts are quick so maybe you went for a run that day and want to add something quick for upper body that isn't too hard. These workouts would be ok for that.
-The lower body was good, although to get any soreness you have to add fairly heavy dumbells, around 15lbs in each hand for me (moderately fit, moderately strong 38yoF). Lower body has 1 full minute for each exercise, which I feel is a good length of time to fatigue the muscle
-I like how she puts cardio into the workouts, which she does not do in Power Circuit Training (and I wish she would)

Cons:
-cheesy airbrushed abs on the trainers, cheesy costumes, low energy. Trainers are just sitting around when they could be doing the exercises in the background
-not really very intense. Upper body segment Jackie doesn't continue the exercises for a full minute, sometimes only 30 seconds, which isn't long enough for fatigue. I wish lower body segment was longer (though you can do it twice)
-sometimes Jackie's rhythm is too quick for people who are using heavier weights. She and her trainers use very light weights so they are always going really fast, yet Jackie continues to (rightly) assert that if you are not at fatigue then you should increase your weights. I actually find with Jillian that you get the opposite problem, the cadence is too slow. And it's harder to increase the weight with Jillian, because the videos are just way more intense.
-for the upper body workout, to make it effective I need a variety of weights ranging in 2lb increments from 5-12lbs, or I have to switch the plates on my bars and pause the video while I'm doing it -- which is annoying. I think I'd find it better if the exercises she chose were more balanced in terms of what is a reasonable weight to use for the various exercises.

3378337,3,B0015D20FY,"This video is easy to follow and is put together well, but it is not an intense work out at all.  I hardly broke a sweat.  It was rather slow paced.  I much prefer her Xteme Timesaver Training, and I was expecting something similar to this.",1365811200,,240,4.173913043478261

3378340,5,B0015D20FY,"I have a good physique (138 pds and 5ft7) and only want to lose the extra 10 pounds around my waist.  I don't like working out and i don't like the gym (people watching, doing nothing, and honestly I just want to be fit and lean and not bulky).  I wanted to start working out at home since i no longer want to pay for the $75 per hour for personal training 3x a week.  I love my personal trainer but i felt i reached a plateau and we were gossiping more than anything during my workout.

I looked at some of the Tracy Anderson videos online and i cannot believe she is heavily sponsored by Gwyneth Paltrow. She just seems like she makes the move as she goes along and she is sexualized with that Facebook ""Look at me"" attitude and some of her moves are just plain silly since even Cirque du Soleil contortionist don't come up with such Goop, and I cannot get past her skimpy outfit and plastic surgery!

So I purchased 3 Jillian Michaels DVD on Amazon since they were the most popular and recognized her name even though i never watched TBL.  I got the 30 Day Shred, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and the No More Trouble Zones. Well, i find her 3-2-1 interval system not what i was expecting.  First there's too much stress on the knee joints and i could feel them right away during the routine.  I tend to listen to my body and it was not feeling comfortable with many of the movements especially the cardio ones. And she talks way too much and can get annoying in the end.  I tried the other two DVDs and the same comments apply.

I decided my last try would be Jackie Warner.  I did not know who she was and was pleasantly surprised at how effective she was at cueing the reps and letting you know what and what not to do without constant chatting.  Of all the exercises in this video, there are maybe 6 i did not feel comfortable doing and just did either some other exercises i love doing or did the modification.

What i love about this workout is that it feels like straightforward no nonsense workout where you can modify or add intensity as you wish.  I feel I have a good workout without feeling or worrying about tear or injury (as she constantly reminds her viewers to - for instance- not let the knee bend past the toes).  I also like the fact that my energy level is up without feeling exhausted the next day.  So for me it's perfect.  I alternate this with the Xtreme abs workout since this is my trouble zone, and the power circuit training.  And they are the perfect combination.

The only con about Jackie for me is the 30 day shred workout DVD.  I did not like it since the pyramid method which consists of 55 ascending repetition is too much for what I am looking for and I just don't have as much fun as with this one and the Xtreme Abs DVD and power circuit.

To summarize: no nonsense straight forward informative exercises that can be easily modified to reduce or increase intensity.  It's a winner!",1365033600,,2921,4.291970802919708

Most work out dvd's bore me to tears, this one was engaging and fun, kept me on my toes and sweating.  If its not burning, its not working! LOVE THIS ONE!",1364774400,,322,3.8181818181818183
3378342,4,B0015D20FY,"I found this title when I did a simple Google search for ""best workout videos for women."" This one was on several of the lists, so after reading the reviews I ordered. I did not know Jackie before and I have never seen the Workout series on Bravo, but I liked the idea of short workouts that could be combined for a longer one.

This is not an easy workout. I've been doing Jillian Michaels and Amy Dixon for about 6 months now, and I was pleased to find a pretty challenging workout. I kind of like it when there's something I can't do on the first or second (or third or fourth) try because it gives me something to work up to and keeps me from getting bored. Jackie's workout definitely fits that bill.

The individual workouts - upper body, lower body, and core - are about 20 minutes each. The menu is easy to navigate, and if you choose more than one of the workouts there is an easy transition between the segments. Each segment begins with a short warmup that concentrates on the area to be worked. There are 4 trainers in the background, three incredible-looking women and one man, and each one does a portion of the workout under Jackie's instruction. Jackie mentions modifications for the upper body and the lower body workout, but mostly she points out ways to make it harder! I haven't taken her up on that offer yet. The core/ab workout is done by Jackie and all four trainers simultaneously, with one trainer consistently showing modifications to make it easier and one trainer showing the more challenging version.

I almost never like a workout video the first time I try it, so I try to use it for at least a week before I make a judgment. I'm so glad I did. I finally did the whole thing today for the first time, and I know I'll be feeling it for the rest of the day. Jackie is encouraging and easy to listen to without a lot of chit chat, which gets old when you watch the same video multiple times.

The only reasons I didn't give this 5 stars, and these are nitpicky but these are the kinds of things I like to know about a video:
*Stretches at the end of each segment are very short. Sometimes that's kind of nice when you're pressed for time, but I find myself wanting to pause the video if I've selected more than one segment.
*Jackie is encouraging, like I said, but sometimes I think we're moving on to another exercise when she says, ""Good job!"" Upon repeated viewings I'll probably get a feel for when the exercise is changing, but I've stopped several times thinking I was done. I may also be having this problem due to the fact that Jackie generally does each move for 1 minute instead of 30 seconds like I'm used to with Jillian Michaels.

This is DEFINITELY a great workout and DEFINITELY worth the purchase. You won't be sorry!",1364601600,,2762,4.38671875

It is easy to do from home, you don't really need any special equipment, other than a mat and possibly some dumbbells, but you don't really need the dumbbells. The workout is challenging, but effective. Before I got this video I used to workout from home, but have achieved greater results from doing this video on a regular basis. I find the workouts fun to do. Jackie also emphasizes proper form on the exercises to avoid injury and to get the best results. I also enjoy the dialogue on the video but I am also a fan of the Workout television show, so if you aren't familiar with the people in the video you might not enjoy their dialogue as much. I like the lower body and ab workouts the best because the upper body workout doesn't seem quite challenging enough. I usually do additional work on my upper body.",1362528000,2,854,4.445859872611465

3378351,4,B0015D20FY,"This workout is changing my body. I exercise because I have to, and don't like pushing myself too hard. At 20 minutes a piece, I can handle doing each segment 1x a week. Additionally, I do cardio 3-4x a week. My abs are easiest for me to work on, and most responsive to exercise. My legs and arms are weaker, and my arms especially hard to tone.

Overall, while a great workout, this DVD takes some getting used to. Jackie switches between exercises quickly and without much instruction. You have to learn as you go, which isn't the worst thing. I cannot keep up with her pace yet but I am still getting a good workout.

It has a terrific abs segment. I've done pilates for years, and this workout had me feeling sore starting that same day. Between this dvd and her Xtreme Timesaver workout (also a great one), I'm losing inches off my waist.

The lower body workout is definitely a challenge, but I'm starting to see definition in my thighs, which is a real feat. My butt/calves still need work. My legs are so sore the day after I do this workout.

Maybe because my arms/upper body are stubborn, it's taking longer to change them. However, I'm building muscle. It'd be great to have her slow down so I can perform the exercises better.

All in all, you're getting an effective workout, considering I'm not willing to do anything too strenuous. It's not perfect, but I have yet to find the perfect workout.",1356048000,4,1408,4.484375
3378352,4,B0015D20FY,"Ok-the actual workout gets 5 stars-after I finish one I feel like I've really worked out that muscle groups and I'm definitely seeing results. It's also fairly simple-there's not a lot of coordination or complex movements so it's easy to really focus on form. I like Jackie-she's not perky or bubbly-but she is encouraging.

I like that in the arms and legs section she works one on one with on of the trainers-it gives the opportunity to really see their form and Jackie is really good about explaining form. Very nice for someone like myself who tends to get sloppy on form over time-keeps me in line.

The drawbacks-and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is twofold

The cuing is awful-there's so many points in the video where she says something that makes you think you're ready to move on to the next exercise when you're not. So you stop to move on to something else and realize-oh crap-we're not done. She even catches a couple of the trainers out with the crap cuing.

The other drawback - Ranessa - the most annoying trainer ever. The porn star voice, the moaning-so over the top. It makes me want to reach through the TV and strangle her.

It's a good workout DVD and after you do it a few times you know what's coming and get used to the crap cuing so it's not as irritating. The same can't be said for Ranessa.

Overall though it's a great workout, tough but doable and Jackie does a good job getting results.",1352332800,2,1423,4.432950191570881
3378353,4,B0015D20FY,This dvd is great when you do the full body workout.  Jackie Warner is very detailed in her explanations and this DVD makes you sweat and feel it.  I love how it is broken up.,1352246400,,175,3.9714285714285715
3378354,5,B0015D20FY,"I bought this video a LONG time ago - but never got around to doing it. Now that I have, I am hooked.

I am a runner (and a pretty decent one) and that will always be my primary sport and workout. But it doesn't help my abs or my back, and as a distance runner my legs could use help, too. My arms are already fairly defined (toting babies around) but I am happy to get stronger!

I love this workout on my non-run days (and sometimes I do the core workout on my run days). I am not looking to lose weight per se - but I know when I am building muscle and THIS DOES IT. No goofy dance moves, everything you do here has a purpose. The techniques are fairly simple, but I find that I always have room to improve on form. There are some new moves in here - but they don't require a training session with the dance squad. I also like that you pick a ""move"" and just DO IT for 30-60 seconds. Too much choreography and I don't feel like I'm getting a work out, as I'm too busy thinking ""what the hell is a kickback side step switch out pop-back?""  Planks, sure. Squats, ok. Curls, alright now.

I appreciate that it's a FULL 60 minutes - not 45 or even 30 (too short!!). But you can still break it down if you are short on time. I don't find the ""cardio"" bits at the end of each weightlifting bit to raise my heartrate - but some of them do just blast out the muscle group you just worked a little more without killing you. And you're moving while catching your breath from the intense strength work.

FINALLY, a workout that blasts my muscles but doesn't ask me to dance around like an idiot. I tried to do a FIRM dvd that I had lying around and about 5 minutes in I ejected and put this one back in. I'm a distance runner, and I'm sorry but I don't ""grapevine"".",1346025600,6,1757,4.022922636103152

I won't bother to go into specifics about her workout segments since other reviewers have already done so. I will just say that I consider myself to be well-rounded when it comes to workout tapes. I have done everything from well known workouts like Jillian Michaels to lesser known workouts gurus like Jari Love. I am in good shape, and like a killer workout. Jackie definitely gets your heart rate going, and her moves are simple yet effective. I tend to use 5 pound weights when doing Bob Harper or Jillian Michael dvds, and I did have to use my 8 pound weights to feel the burn a bit more. Other than that, I would say Jackie can hang with the best of the home workout buffs!",1338163200,,935,4.252808988764045

I usually gave up on them after two or three times of trying to follow these dvd workouts. Finally, with One-On-One Training with Jackie, I've found a workout I can do at home when I can't make it to the gym. This dvd has three short, 20-minute circuit workout routines that are easy to follow and engages the abdominals from beginning to end. You can choose to do one workout, two or three in one viewing. Best of all, you can increase the intensity if you are at an intermediate or advanced level.

You will definitely be sore after the first day or so doing this, but a week later and they seems to get easier and easier. You WILL get results doing these exercises.

I am out of breath throughout the workout and covered in sweat by the end.  I know it's working because I am sore the next day.  After regularly using the video, and consuming a healthy diet, for about a month there was a noticeable difference in my body.  Not only had I lost weight, but my body was toned.  I especially noticed a difference in my legs and butt.  They were firm, not flabby as they had been before.  I would recommend this video to anyone willing to complete a high intensity workout.  This is so much more effective than using an eliptical for an hour at the gym (burns more calories too!).  I also love the versatility.  You can do all 3 20 minute workouts or you can break them up and do 20 minutes a day.  The lower body is the toughest for me, so on days when I'm not feeling very energetic I will just do the upper body or the core workout instead.  I love that Jackie is encouraging withoug being annoying, like trainers in some other workout dvds.

I also love that there are three included workouts, upper body, lower body and abs. You can select which you want to do at the beginning and it stacks them up for you. The camera angles are great and you get a clear instruction on how to properly perform each exercise. It's a tough workout and lots of modifications are provided to make each exericse easier or more difficult as you progress.

The actual content is well-described by other reviewers, so I'll avoid repeating.

I will say that I own a lot of exercise DVDs - Jackie, Jillian Michaels, Tracy Anderson, Bob Harper, Jeanette Jenkins.  This is my favorite in terms of effectiveness.  I've been doing it for 4 months and noticed results, especially in my arms.

This DVD focuses just on strength training.  I prefer this over the ""time saving"" workouts that combine strength training and cardio.

The production value is not as good as her later DVDs.  The demonstrators are annoying at first.  However, you do one exercise for about 40 seconds so you don't have to stare at the tv for most of the workout. That's another thing I like.

DVDs are personal, so I'm not sure how much this comment will help others, but I like Jackie's personality.  Much prefer her to Jillian Michaels.  Jackie is encouraging without being annoying.",1322352000,4,946,4.7592592592592595

3378376,5,B0015D20FY,"I too have finally found a real keeper.  Jackie's workout targets all the major muscle groups and can be done mixing and matching the three 20 minute segments of upper body, lower body and abs/core or the full hour.  She gives you modifications to increase or decrease the intensity and difficulty of each move so you can continually progress in your routine rather than staying stagnate.  I suggest you have some background in fitness especially with proper form so that you don't injure yourself since she does move pretty fast through the routine which is why I believe it is so effective.  Each segment really works the muscles to the point of burning and it makes you sweat plus it really does fly by - ""fastest and funnest hour I have spent working out with weights""!  If you like this sort of thing this is the DVD for you.  I would consider this a seasoned beginner or intermediate workout.  The abs are fabulous and effective for any level!

Now I have four of her DVDs and love them all.  They all have something different, and this one is my newest, and it didn't disappoint.  Jackie still has her ""helpers"" behind her, demonstrating the routines as Jackie corrects their form and gives you encouragement.  In this ""One-on-One"", Jackie only has one helper at a time take the floor, and Jackie works with them, and you, individually.  Jackie talks the helper through the routine, telling YOU how to correct the most common mistakes and what poor posture will do (or NOT do, as the case may be), motivating you to really get it right!  Rather than the camera flicking between two, three, or a room full of people like in some videos, in this one, Jackie and her helper are the sole focus of the camera, so YOU can figure out how/what to work on.  It's awesome.  I felt *almost* like I'd had a session with Jackie by the time the DVD was done.  (I say ""almost"", because at home, I can use lighter weights than I think Jackie would think I could use! ;) hahaha)

Other reviewers have gone into a little more detail about the breakdown of exercises, so I will just tell you that good grief, this DVD will kill you, and I mean that in the best way. You can break the 3 workouts down to focus on just upper body, lower body, or abs, but doing all three takes just over an hour and is a fantastic workout. I was really surprised by the results it delivers.

I have been a fan of Jillian Michaels and her 30 Day Shred for a long time. That's a great workout when you consider that it's about 20 minutes and actually does work all your major muscle groups and get your your heart rate up and keep it there. It's a nice time-saver for Monday through Friday when you want to hit everything but just don't want to commit a full hour to working out. This workout, however, uses 20 minutes to focus on just one area and keep your heart rate up with cardio bursts throughout. It's very effective, as a result. They show you how the exercises can be modified to work for beginners or made more difficult (or as I call those modifications when I see them, ""freaking impossible,"" lol).

I worked out to different DVDs for about 20-30 minutes, 3x a week, before I got this DVD, so I wasn't totally a beginner. It did manage to make me feel like a beginner, though! It's very challenging, even for someone who isn't out-of-shape. I use 8 lb. weights for the weighted exercises and I can't imagine how long it would take for me to build up to using even 10 lbs. This workout is a strength-training powerhouse; I can tell I'm getting stronger every time I use it.

The premise of the video is one-on-one training. Each trainer comes up and has a little segment of a few exercises, with Jackie coaching them throughout and sometimes doing some of the moves as well. I think that's a good strategy. Groups of people can get out of synch in videos; with this DVD, you only have to watch one person. She does go immediately into the exercise and explains it during the reps, so as others have said, you may find yourself trying to catch up or rewinding it a bit during the first couple of viewings. She does give excellent pointers and tell you where you should be feeling each exercise.

Also, let me just say that looking at her abs fills me with a mix of hope, contempt, and jealousy. This lady is FIT. I can say in all seriousness, faithfully adding this workout to my repertoire does feel like it will get me a little closer to those cut abs that everyone wants to have. The ab workout is both doable and brutal. I've never been so sore in my abs from any other DVD, but personally, I want some soreness after a workout! I love feeling like I've REALLY gotten something done.

I'm really happy with this purchase. Again, I'm no noob to home workouts and I've got some of the best of them, but I'm almost hooked on this one. You can customize it for your level of fitness and for what areas you want to target, and you always feel like you've gotten a lot done the next day. If you get this and stick with it, you will see (and ow, yes, feel) the results.",1311465600,4,3097,4.287179487179487
3378382,5,B0015D20FY,Jackie Warner is an excellent trainer.  She is very upbeat and informative.  I use this video at a minimum of twice a week and have seen great results.  I think her core section is the best I have done.  She shows in great detail how each move should be performed for maximum results.  She has a very friendly and encouraging attitude to go for it and to work hard to advance your skills.,1309824000,,388,4.260273972602739
3378383,4,B0015D20FY,"I love Jackie Warner's workout dvds. I have the ""Power Circuit Training"", ""Xtreme Time Saver"" and ""Crunchless Abs"" Workout, which I would give all of those 5 stars.
I started working out with Jillian Michaels DVDS which i love, but once I tried ""Xtreme Time Saver"", I was hooked!
I really liked this dvd, but it was my least favorite out of the four. I think the workouts itself were really good, but I got annoyed with the other trainers in this dvd. The girls are cute, but they don't seem like their serious, in fact they way they act and look and sound, it makes me feel uncomfortable (like im watching a dirty movie). But I continue to use the dvd because I like the mixture of weight training and cardio moves.
If your looking for a good workout thats challenging and fun and kicks your butt, definately try Jackie!",1309478400,,821,4.443708609271523

3378385,4,B0015D20FY,don't like the girls in slinky clothes standing around...somehow I feel more like she's trying to make a buck off the video than sharing a passion for fitness,1307836800,,158,4.678571428571429
3378386,5,B0015D20FY,"I have recently become slightly addicted to weight training, and this DVD has my absolute favorite upper body routine. Nice, solid, 20-minute workout that will leave your arms burning. Jackie gives you a lot of variety in moves and does a great job of explaining proper form.

The core routine is BRUTAL! I'm a chubby girl, so I was definitely following Renessa's modifications for the majority of the moves. But I can feel it working, I get stronger every time. I also like that Jackie has Jesse doing advanced modifications as well. It's nice to know that there will be ways for me to continue pushing myself and making things more challenging as I get stronger and fitter.

Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the lower body workout at all, but that's certainly not Jackie's fault. I have very bad knees and can't do workouts that involve a lot of lunges and squats. Ballet and pilates are pretty much the only lower body toning exercises my body can handle. So if you have bad knees, you may want to avoid this one. Otherwise, it looks like one heck of a workout.

There were definitely a couple things I could have done without. Firstly, I don't like that the trainers come up one by one in the upper and lower body workouts. I don't like waiting while Jackie congratulates one and calls the next one up. Come on, I'm working up a sweat here! Let's keep moving!

Also, Jackie throws in little bits of cardio throughout each workout. Personally, I like to do all of my strengthening first, then get some cardio in. That's just a personal preference however, and the cardio intervals are so short that it really doesn't bother me too much.

All in all, fantastic workout from Jackie. Very excited to try her other DVDs.",1307145600,2,1718,4.583061889250814
3378397,5,B0015D20FY,this is an excellent video. Jackie is a great trainer who maximizes every muscle group with this video. i love her one on one instruction with her trainers. i'm gonna add more of her videos to my collection!,1306368000,,207,4.473684210526316
3378398,2,B0015D20FY,"I have 3 of Jackie's newer workout dvd's and really like them, so I decided to order her first one. I couldn't stomach the outfits-it's like working out with the Playboy Bunny club.",1304899200,3,181,4.515151515151516
3378399,5,B0015D20FY,"I know it's a little late in the game to review this DVD since Jackie has added at least 5 more to the list since then but I have to shamefully admit to having this DVD on my shelf for well over a year before admitting defeat and the need to exercise the blasted baby weight off.  Let me add now that I also own ""30 Day Shred""--for me these two trainers are my preferred venue of great work outs without feeling as though I need to hire a dance coach on the side.  They are no-nonsense, sweat till you cry, and do it in less than 30 min.  I love both...They are not the same exercises but as I said it's all about feeling the burn and both move quickly from one work-out to another with little to no downtime.  Jillian has a wonderful all around workout, and Jackie breaks it down.  I go back and forth between these two with a little yoga on the side for stretch, and I tell you that in two weeks I've lost 5 lbs.  (Diet is very much a part of my weight loss arsenal).
Now, all that said, what excited and made me want to write this review for Jackie seeing that Jillian has a gazillion for 30-Day Shred is the core work out.  Holy black beans Batman!!!!  I can only do 60%, but when she says core she means CORE!  I am in awe of these, long since gone from Bravo, trainers.  Just watching them get thru everything without throwing a brick at Jackie's head impressed me.  To me this is core at its most intense.  Good going Jackie!!!!",1304035200,2,1435,4.103942652329749
3378400,5,B0015D20FY,"I recently tried my first Jackie Warner dvd and found I liked it so much that I am trying her other videos as well.  This one really got me sweating.  I am a daily exerciser who does a bit of everything, kickboxing, dance, pilates, yoga, walking, etc.  I do have some resistance videos but they tend not to be my favorites, but I know that it is important for my bones and to help burn fat so I gave this one a go. Once again, Jackie's cuing is spot-on.  She has a great style-not too drill sargeant and not too chirpy, she is encouraging but not over-the-top.  She doesn't just talk the moves, she actually does them and then tells you what you should or should not do to have good form.  She always has one of her trainers showing modified form which may be needed if you are newer to these types of exercises.  This dvd is comprised of three workouts, an upper body, lower body & core workout and each goes for 20 minutes.  Mind you, these are not 20 easy minutes....they are packed with intervals between toning and cardio to help you burn maximum calories.  You get in, exhaust the muscle and move to the next exercise so even if you do all three work-outs together it somehow seems to fly by.

The exercises are classics, chest presses, flys, kickbacks, military presses, crunches, planks, push-ups, squats, lunges etc.  No complicated steps, just good old-school exercises that are classics for a reason...they work!

If you want to get your blood pumping and get some excellent target toning, this one is for you.  I definitely would consider purchasing this dvd for myself and would recommend it to other intermediate/advanced exercisers who are looking for a good work-out.",1302825600,,1683,4.60738255033557

I never had a workout that make me feel so good burning lol.  But not too challenging that I quit.  Jackie says you can do anything for a minute, and Im starting to believe her :)
Oh, I am not in shape, but where I see results quick with this dvd is in my core area.  clothes become better fitting in only days!!!!  Now, of course also due to staying away from excess sugar and saturated fat.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone at any level. Only little challenge is some of the exercises that require bending over gets straining on my back because I have problems with my spine.

So many videos that I have viewed from my local library (before purchasing) are overwhelming, move way to fast and are frustrating, so I am thankful that I found this one and I have been doing it every day since it arrived.
It's a great mix of moves, some old ones as well as new, just up the weight and you'll get a better workout. For less than $30.00 (dvd and weights) I have a perfect workout to do at home. I'm on a mission to tone up and this is going to help me reach that goal.",1300147200,,642,3.9844961240310077

To my surprise, I found most of the trainers in this video to be extremely annoying and chatty.  I couldn't stand the banter back and forth between them and Jackie...'this is too easy', 'i'm really feeling this one'.  And the outfits made me roll my eyes.  I'm really not someone who pays attention to these things, but I just couldn't bear it.  And seeing them sitting in the background was terrible...at least make them not visible!

When I first started my workouts, I was a bigger Jillian fan, but found some of her workouts were tremendously hard on some of my joints (particularly since recovering from an ACL/MCL injury). With Jillian, it is a harder cardio workout. With Jackie, my muscles experience the fatigue that I am aiming for in the work out without the soreness or joint pain. I started seeing more muscle tone. I am absolutely loving it and just ordered Jackie's other DVDs.

The other aspect I particularly like about this DVD is how the workouts are broken down. You have the option of customizing - upper body, legs and abs. Within each of the mini-workouts, there are additional breaks as she has different people come in to perform the exercises. With each person, there are approximately 3-4 exercises done, 1 minute each. As a result, there are the 5 second breaks that really enable you to exercise longer. Mentally, it is a good break and knowing that the exercises are relatively short (minute long), you remain motivated.

Jackie is professional, knows her stuff, and I like her rapport with her workout team (unlike Jillian Michaels  who, on 30-Day Shred, can only manage jock talk with ""my girls,"" as she calls the two very competent women who do the workout while Jillian flaps her gums).  Anyway, Jackie is a breath of fresh air.  The ab section is so effective and really varied, so it's fun (I can't believe I'm saying that!).  All the moves are creative, the set is not distracting, and Jackie's cuing is spot on, but she's not overly chatty or fake.

3378449,3,B0015D20FY,"I own this workout and keep coming back to it because it is an excellent workout that promises results. However, I would not recommend the workout for beginner exercisers or weight lifters. To start, Werner does not tell you which weights her trainers are using. I am a woman and began with 8lb weights, and moved down to 5lbs, which still guarantee a burn but will reduce your risk of injury. I'm not happy that I worked this out on a trial basis. Next, whenever she had her trainers perform a modification, Werner made it seem as if the modification would not be as beneficial to the exerciser. I know that some beginner exercisers may hear this and try to do the regular version of a move, thus increasing the chance for injury. It's OK to modify! I just wish she would have said that, it seems a bit negligent not to tell your client (i.e. the viewer) that modifications do still yield results. Next, there was no rhythm set, or if Werner did count out the moves it was out of time with the low-budget music. She did call for good form, but didn't give many very basic tips. Finally, the stretches. Why was I stretching my legs after the ab stretch, and why was I doing the cobra directly after a lower-back and butt workout? I found the lower body and ab stretches to be extremely counterintuitive, and I usually have to stop the video at that point and do my own cool down and stretch. Having said that, and although the workout is extremely boring and not so motivational, I keep coming back because it is a very comprehensive workout. My advice is to know your body, put on some music and just watch the video as a cue for when to change exercises, as the words coming out of Werner's mouth just get annoying.",1278028800,4,1717,4.40251572327044

3378451,5,B0015D20FY,This is an awesome video that allows you to take it as a beginner or kick it up a few notches.  It goes by fast and I always feel like I worked out hard.  I would recommend it and have!,1277683200,3,185,3.6
3378452,4,B0015D20FY,I liked this workout. It is not my favorite but I am happy with it. I like the added short cardio segments vs. the other workout by Jackie (Power Circuit Training). I also like the format with the feature of working with one person.  It really helps to focus on the form and doing to moves correctly. I am finding that I do use this DVD often but it has not replaced my favorites.,1277164800,2,380,4.135135135135135
3378453,4,B0015D20FY,"I am probably an intermediate level of fitness.  Great workout, great instructor.  She has a no nonsense style, routines that both men and women wouldn't mind doing, and a pleasant voice.  If I had to choose, I would say that I liked her other Power Circuit DVD just a little bit better.  Overall, would love to see more from Jackie.",1276646400,,333,4.5
3378454,4,B0015D20FY,"Others have done a great job writing comprehensive reviews on the product. I think it's a great DVD for a beginning-to-intermediate exerciser, although if you are advanced, there's nothing that says you WON'T get a good workout (and she provides plenty of modifying opportunities to make the moves harder); there's just probably nothing on it that you haven't seen before. One thing that might be tough for the raw beginner is she moves fast. Not only does she move from exercise to exercise quickly, the move themselves are performed fast. I took away one star because of this--if you don't know what you're doing, going that fast can lead to injury but more than that, I found it kind of jerky and annoying. The other thing that bothered me (a tiny bit) was the sort of sycophantish perkiness of her colleagues (""oh Jackie, I LOVE this one!!!""), but some people might see it as encouragement and comraderie (and they might like working out with the people who are on her reality show). But in the end, if you want a circuit weigth training routine, this is a good contender.",1275350400,4,1076,4.698412698412699
3378455,5,B0015D20FY,"I was a fan of the show and was curious about Jackie's training methods, so I picked this up.  I do not enjoy working out to videos or DVD's as a rule but this one is an exception for me.  First I love the way the menu is set up.  There are three separate workouts that you can choose to do singly, altogether or in pairs.  The workouts themselves are extremely effective.  I consider myself to be an in shape woman as I do cardio and weight training most days of the week but these workouts absolutely fry me!  I have to advise you to take these slowly at first as I was sore for two weeks (honestly, two weeks) after the first time I did the lower body workout.  I do lunges, squats, kick backs, the bridge - all of the exercises that Jackie takes you through on this DVD at least twice a week but the non-stop 60 minute sets in combination with the lower body focused bursts of cardio she leads you through are super effective! As she explains on the video, she ""exhausts"" the muscle for maximum results.  My legs were literally quivering and I had very little strength left after my first time through the lower body workout.",1274313600,,1129,4.267605633802817
3378456,5,B0015D20FY,"This is an amazing workout. I've always done the entire 60 minute total workout and it is a killer! Jackie did a great job breaking up the exercises, because as soon as you reach a point you think you can't go on, she swaps to another exercise.",1272153600,,244,4.212765957446808
3378457,4,B0015D20FY,"I do like this dvd, but I am kind of starting to get a little bored with it. The workouts are definately hard and they make you ""feel the burn"" etc. I get a little annoyed by the backup trainers as they seem to lack maturity. As for Jackie herself she does a good job of explaining good form etc. It does bother me a little that she really dosn't put much effort into doing the exercises herself. Most of the time she is just talking. She will also say ""you're almost there"" when you aren't even close. Now that I have my complaints out of the way I will tell you that I have seen results, especially in my arms and abs. I really dread the core/abs portion of this wokout only because it is really hard...a good kind of hard. There are modifications of all the exercises (harder and easier)so don't be intimidated if your just starting out. If you are looking for a good mix of cardio and strength this is a good choice. However, there is quite a bit more strength training and toning than cardio.",1271894400,2,997,4.252631578947368

3378459,5,B0015D20FY,"Ouch!  My quads were a hot mess for 3 days the first time I used this dvd.  That let me know how far out of shape I had become.  I have used this dvd (in conjuction with others) for over a month.  Now I need to use heavier weights for most of the exercises.  Combined with the heart rate being relatively high OUTSIDE of the cardio Jackie has added in this workout, and it's clear the fat is melting.  If you like mixing your cardio with your body sculpting (the reps are too high to add bulk), then stop reading and just buy it.  Bravo Jackie (pun intended)!!!",1271548800,,561,4.138888888888889

I like the cardio and the fact that she takes it back to basics your not doing some off the wall thing to your body.  You just need some weights and a mat .  I love it !!",1271116800,,569,3.9217391304347826
3378461,5,B0015D20FY,I don't understand the negative reviews. I have tryed other dvd's since I don't have a gym to go to and this one is by far my favorite. I do all 3 workouts which takes an hour. By the end I can feel the burn and the sweat. She does transition in the video but not fast as another person wrote. I let 2 of my co-workers do this video and they both loved it as well. I haven't tried the Julian Michael videos but I have tried the boot camp ones and I like this one by far.,1270944000,,470,3.757575757575758
3378462,5,B0015D20FY,"I own so many workout dvds, and only about half of them get used. I rotate between about 5 or 6 dvds varying from pilates to tae bo. This dvd has been in the rotation for almost a year and is still a good workout that leaves my muscles fatigued. You get to choose arms, legs, or stomach, or any combination of those. I'm a big fan of the arms workout. Not only do you do arm exercises, but you also do quick 1 minute cardio blasts to keep your heart rate up. The stomach exercise is also a favorite of mine. It's especially nice because she has one trainer showing how to do the exercise low impact, two showing medium, and one showing high impact usually with weights. So as you progress, you know what to do to increase your strength. This is basically a pick-your-spot exercise dvd. I'll usually combine with another dvd that will give me a full body/cardio workout or run/jog before I do this dvd.",1269561600,,901,4.305882352941176
3378463,5,B0015D20FY,"I let this video sit around for six months before opening it - I had purchased Denise Austin's bootcamp at the same time and thought that would be the video I would see results with.  I was wrong - and on Saturday, I decided to finally open this DVD and complete the whole workout.  It was amazing and I can't wait to do it again!!  Unfortunately, I have to wait and rest - since my arms and shoulders are so sore.  After one workout, I already feel stronger.  I'm excited to see the results after one to two months as others have mentioned in their reviews.  You will definitely feel this workout all over.  Jackie reminds you when movements are suppose to 'burn' and to do only part of the movement if you can't keep up with the full ones.
The upper body workout is definitely my favorite, however, the core workout comes in a close second.  There are even modified movements done by one of the other trainers - helpful for someone like me who still has a sensitive neck from a car accident years ago.
I love this - just wish I had opened it sooner!",1266192000,,1051,4.2727272727272725
3378464,5,B0015D20FY,"This DVD is more difficult than the Power Circuit Training with Jackie - but still totally doable and very worth the purchase.  I like that this workout incorporates cardio in with the strength training moves, which her other one does not, but this one also requires a little more time - better for days when I have a little extra time to workout and really want to sweat (and curse).  Jackie is very focused on form and very motivational and she also offers modifications for easier and harder, which is key.  I like that instead of working the whole body (like Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred) it works one zone at a time - abs, upper body, lower body - so you can rotate them doing each one for 3 days out of a week or do each one once during the week if you prefer.  If you like the intensity of Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred than you will like this DVD.",1265587200,,856,4.233128834355829
3378465,5,B0015D20FY,This is an excellent workout video. You get the best results you can get without having to pay for a personal trainer and you don't even have to leave your house.

THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS SHE HAS THE VIDEO BROKEN UP INTO 3 PARTS, UPPER BODY, LOWER BODY AND CORE.  SO IF YOU WANT A COMPLETE WORKOUT YOU NEED TO DO ALL THREE.  I WOULD LIKE TO DO A BIT OF ALL THREE IN 40 MINUTES INSTEAD OF ALL THREE IN 60 MINUTES, BUT FEEL GUILTY IF I DON'T DO THE WHOLE WORKOUT.  I RUN ON THE TREADMILL EVERYDAY TOO, BUT WANT A COMPLETE WORKOUT ALSO.  SO TO RUN FOR 50 MINUTES THEN WORKOUT FOR 60 MINUTES ISN'T IDEAL FOR ME, BUT MAY BE PERFECT FOR OTHERS.

3378467,5,B0015D20FY,"I recently purchased both this DVD and Jackie's newest DVD, Personal Training with Jackie: Power Circuit Training. I'm happy with my purchases and as someone who is in good shape, I found myself struggling to keep up and incredibly sore the next day!

THE NEGATIVES: This DVD, Workout: One on One Training with Jackie, is fast-paced nearly to a fault. I felt as though I was struggling to keep good form because I was trying so hard to simply keep up with the moves due to the lack of cues.

Jackie, along with her trainers, jump right into the moves with little explanation and then focus/explain the form after the move has begun. Perhaps it's just personal preference, but I like to have a bit of preparation before jumping into a move.

I also felt like the format was a bit casual/haphazard. Each trainer did some one-on-one moves with Jackie, then sat on a large exercise ball in the back, watching. It was a bit weird.

THE POSITIVES: It's a great workout and one that left me quite sore the next day. The fast pace keeps you on your toes and makes the time go by very quickly. I love that I can pick and choose which moves I'd like to include from the menu. My legs were so sore from working out earlier that I did myself a favor and left the lower body workout out that day. It's great for a brief workout (each set, uppper, lower and abs are just 20 minutes each) or an extended workout if time allows.

Jackie does a great job of showing ways to make each move easier or harder, depending on your skill level. Overall, I loved this workout and would recommend it.",1263859200,3,1574,4.376712328767123
3378468,5,B0015D20FY,"Just got this and I love it. Its simple but challenging. Jackie is very likable.  There were a few exercises on here that were new to me.  This DVD is different and a nice break from all my others that have more cardio, because now I am trying to focus more on strength after so many years of neglecting that for cardio only.  My body feels firmer already.
I definitely want to get her other DVD since I like this one so much.
As far as what the other trainers are doing in the background, I could care less.  That bothered me in now way at all.
I also really like Jillian Michael's 30 day shred.  Both are excellent workouts that will get you results.",1262563200,,652,4.184
3378469,5,B0015D20FY,"I had always wanted my own fitness DVD, but I am very hesitant about how I spend my money. I had always done free workouts from On-Demand on my TV. None of them really pushed you past 'that' limit that went beyond following along someone trying to put you into a bunch of pointless positions for 20 minutes that weren't even that challenging, until one day I tried a new workout on demand that blew my mind and was the only real workout I'd done from TV that if I knew I kept up with it would actually help me become more fit. I noticed that it was only on On Demand for a limited amount of time and didn't want to lose being able to do the exercises on the video, and I noticed an ad that came up after I did it saying you could buy her DVD with those exercises on it. I was actually really excited to buy this DVD. When I got it I noticed it not only had the Core Workout I did on my TV, but two other seperate workouts that were equally as challenging for your arms and your legs/butt. I am STILL working up to the point where I can even make it through the core with out having to take a break - these workouts are straight to the point and transition from a certain work-out for that area to another challenging position that challenges that area. She mixes both cardio and sweating with muscle-building workouts. by the time I am done with it I am red and sweaty and sometimes I want to yell I try so hard!

Combining this workout with running and eating well yields amazing results, let me tell you. Although I work behind a counter, I have been asked if I was a gymnast by a random customer because I had gained nice muscle tone especially in my butt and midsection from this video combined with running. Also if I did ballet. This was about 3 months after I had begun doing the video a few times a week and running as well. I have always been relatively small and thin, but have never really had muscle tone until beginning my workouts. SO i think I have said enough about how life-changing this has been for me! Good luck to anyone else and all I have to say is don't give up and push yourself every time!",1262390400,7,2115,4.133495145631068
3378470,4,B0015D20FY,"Jackie does good 20 minute workouts.  Sometimes the full minute of one exercise is a little grueling because I'm used to pushing it for just 30 seconds.  Also, it's not always obvious when one exercise is getting near the end.  I think it's nice to have the trainer push you for just, ""5 more seconds"" so you see an end in sight and push yourself.  I like the variety, though!",1261958400,2,376,4.328571428571428
3378471,5,B0015D20FY,"I don't even know where to begin. I have been doing this workout tape for over a year now (twice a week) and it has changed my life....literally! I have always hated my body and wanted to work out, but didn't want to get a gym membership because of the cost. This DVD has given me the body I want: muscular and tight without being too muscular.
  Although it is true that these excercises aren't for beginners, Jackie shows you a modified version of each exercise that is geared toward beginners. You will be doing strength training AND cardio in this workout, so there is no need for a seperate routine for cardio.
  I have always had love handles and a ""pooch"" and a large saggy behind, but now I have a six pack, a strong muscular lower back, and a rock hard behind (although still large, it's all muscle :-D).
  She breaks it up into upper, lower, and core workouts so that if you don't have trouble with one of these areas of your body (for me this is my upper body), you don't have to waste your time working that part out. They are 20 minutes each and contain anywhere from 15-20 excercises in each, with stretching at the ends of each.
  To sum up, I would highly recommend this product if you'd like to get in great shape and MAINTAIN that shape in very little time (I saw results within a month) and very little time each week. Any woman, I believe, can have their self-image completely turned around with this DVD! You will love your body and you don't even need to go to the gym!

Well worth the time it took to complete. It's broken up into three twenty minute sections that I do throughout the day when I get a chance or makes one hell of workout done straight through.  Jackie Warner is not one of those annoying workout instructors and her explanations of each exercise were great.

Mixing cardio and strength training, anyone is sure to benefit from her easy to follow routines based on upper body, lower body, and core training. You can do each twenty minute work out alone, or combine them together for a forty or sixty minute ultra work out. I really enjoy this DVD for working out.

I have had a personal trainer before at my local gym and this is very comparable to that experience.  If you like Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, then you enjoy this video as well.

The cool thing is if you're not challenged and suffering add more weight and you once again will be..in a good way.

It's hard for me to stick to most workout videos (trust me, I've purchased a lot) because I quickly lose interest.  I first saw this video on Comcast Exercise on Demand and could barely get through it, but I really liked how it was broken down based on what I felt like doing at the moment.  I eventually purchased this video and have no regret that I did.  The way this video is broken down into three 20 minute workouts makes it ideal to use when you have a lot of time or not a lot of time.  On days where work eats up most of my time, I love to do the 20 minute core workout since it mainly works out your core but your arms and legs get some workout as well during the aerobic interval. There's so many variations to work on different parts of your core that you just don't have time to get bored.  The upper body workout is very effective -- no more muffin tops when I wear mid to lowrise jeans/pants.  When I first did the upper body, I could barely finish it.  As time went by, I felt my upper body getting stronger and I can do heavier weights and definitely more pushups -- my arms are actually toned now so I was able to wear tank tops all summer proudly.  The lower body is my least favorite mainly because my muscles are so sore for like 2-3 days afterwards, however, it works but makes me fearful of the pain afterwards!

There is much focus on appearance and hairstyles, and not so much on making the workouts interesting or especially challenging- with the exception of the ab section.

It was actually funny because I felt like I knew the people I was working out with, is that weird? LOL I found it amusing when Jackie would tease the trainers, especially Jesse. But I got it because I watch the show, not sure how someone would react to the interactions if they don't watch the show...

All that aside, I was literally SOAKED in sweat during this work-out, and I'm not a beginner (I work out 5-6 times a week). It was dripping off me, literally! Therefore I don't understand why someone in one of these negative reviews could say they didn't burn any calories... who says you can only burn calories from cardio??? And its not like there was no cardio. If it feels too easy, increase your weight, plain and simple. I started out with 8lbs but downsized to 5lbs because of the high number of reps (which I liked!). I do plan to do this one again, it's not my favorite but it's not the worst. Its comprehensive, easy to follow and it gets the job done.

Just as an after thought, it didn't bother me that Jackie wasn't doing the exercises the whole time and did more instructing. But it DID bug me when Jillian Michael's in 30-Day Shred doesn't do hers... Maybe because I know the trainers in Jackie's video know what they're doing and aren't just back-up dancers like Jillians!",1250035200,,1574,4.296296296296297
3378490,2,B0015D20FY,"I was really looking forward to using this DVD. I thought it would have really kicked my butt, but it did not.

I finished the entire workout, but I was so bored and kept wondering when it will be over. Sorry this one did not do it for me.

Maybe her next one will be a lot harder and more intense.",1248220800,3,298,3.8688524590163933
3378491,5,B0015D20FY,"Watching the show 'workout' i could tell Jackie is a little hardcore- so i decided to ease myself into these 3-part workouts slowly. hardcore is what i need, just not BAM all at once!

i just received it yesterday, and not wanting to get my a*s kicked too bad, i thought it would serve my interest to do just one of the 20 minute sessions, to try and get used to the pace and how she operates.

needless to say, i still got my bum kicked! i did the Abs session, and while the exercises are oldies but goodies, it BURNED! but in the good- 'im working it!' way :) im quite sore this morning.

My favorite aspects :

1) Unlike Jillian Michaels, Jackie tries to motivate you and keep you going without being ridiculously CHEESY. Her motivation works!

2) She has four of her trainers do the exercises behind her, and two of those trainers show moderations of each exercise- one easier, and one harder. It caters to all levels of fitness

I highly recommend this product to anyone!",1248220800,,976,4.394444444444445
3378492,5,B0015D20FY,I would recommend this product to anyone. There are modifications for the more difficult/challenging exercises if you are not in shape. And modifications to make the exercises more challenging if you are in shape. The three circuits offer a complete body workout. The DVD has a great pace with great tips to ensure you are doing the exercises correctly. This DVD helped me get in shape for summer in addition i also run 5 days a week. The combination helped me drop weight and tone my body. I plan on continuing to use this DVD. It has been one month and I definitely notice the difference and can see more muscle definition.,1247443200,,625,4.589285714285714
3378493,4,B0015D20FY,"This DVD contains 3 twenty minute workouts that focus on upper body, lower body, or the core which you can do together or separately.  Each workout is comprised of intervals of both strength and cardio moves that are done for a minute each.  Generally, for every four strength exercises, there is one cardio move that follows.  In all likelihood, you've seen most of the exercises on this DVD a thousand times before - squats, lunges, crunches, bicep curls, etc. However, for what this tape lacks in fun factor, it definitely delivers a tough workout.  I can always feel my muscles the day after (especially my hip flexors for whatever reason).  In addition, the minute-per-exercise approach is great for motivation - as Jackie says, you can do anything for a minute, so it motivates you to push through.

For each of the workouts, Jackie is in the lead with four trainers behind her.  In the upper and lower body workouts, Jackie works with one trainer at a time.  In the core workout, all the trainers are working out at once.  One demonstrates beginner modifications while another shows advanced modifications.  A purely aesthetic complaint is the incredible amount of makeup each trainer is wearing ALL OVER their body. I sometimes find myself staring at their abs and wondering what it must be like to be slathered in bronzer there.  Also, I find myself staring at the other trainers in the background during the upper and lower body workouts - it seems like a waste that they're doing nothing and sometimes they look quite bored.

Overall, I think this is a highly effective exercise DVD for the short amount of time required for each workout.  It's not necessarily the most fun you'll ever have, but it certainly does work.",1247356800,,1730,4.804054054054054

Her team of four trainers each take a routine set within each session.  The workout combines a variety of movements so it is never boring. Adaptations are provided so beginners and advanced users can benefit from the series of workouts.  I'm hooked.  It's a burner, so be prepared to sweat!

The setup is good, where you can choose whether you want to do upper body, lower body or your abs.  But that's just the menu.  Jackie is sarcastic and not amusing.  Her motivation is limited to ""you can do anything for a minute"" and the guidance on perfect form is minimal in the workout portions. Even her trainers seem like they don't want to be there, so why would I want to do this workout ever again?

3378507,5,B0015D20FY,"I love this DVD!!! I usually don't write reviews about items I have purchased, but I have to write one about this because it is one of the best workout DVDs I have ever used!!

If you're looking to get in shape, this is where it's at. It is a super intense weight workout mixed with cardio sections to specifically target the areas just exercised. It's a great design. Some of the moves are incredibly challenging, but do-able especially with the positive reinforcement intermixed from Jackie and her trainers.

I am a pretty active person and this workout really gets my muscles sore and I have seen terrific definition in just a couple weeks. The DVD is also great because you can choose to do all 3 (upper,lower,core) workouts consecutively or individually choose and the DVD automatically plays your selection back-to-back. (The core workout is extremely challenging and when chosen with one or two other workouts it is always last, so I like to play it first so that I am not worn-out by the time I have to do what's already a strenuous workout.) Get your water bottle ready, you'll definitely need it after the cardio sections.

This DVD actually makes me sweat (coming from someone that doesn't break a sweat very easily). If you want great results, stick with it and do at least one of the exercises daily. Get your bootcamp mentality ready because Jackie's definitely going to give you a swift kick...but totally worth every second. The 20 min segments are great and are broken down into shorter segments which makes them seem concise.

Great for people who enjoy a good workout and feeling sore. All the exercises can be made more simple (for beginners) or stepped up a notch (for the over-achievers).

I cannot say enough good things about the DVD...I absolutely love it. I just wish there were more DVDs from Jackie b/c I love her style.

I was very pleased with it.  It really works you as hard as you want it to, Jackie shows you variations on all the moves, and she stresses proper form.  I like that it's broke up in 20-minute workouts (one each for upper body, lower body, and abs).  You can do one, two, or all three.  I also liked how she fit in some cardio in each segment, it's great to get more burn by raising your heartrate.  Each set of exercises are done for a minute, and you usually do 2-3 sets, then 1 minute of cardio, and repeat this sequence until it's done.  Each 20-minute segment has a warm-up and a cool-down.

The other two trainers (Rebecca and Agostina) were terrible and like watching 2 dead fish.

And I can't say enough about Jackie Warner.  I really like her style.  She is not brash or loud.  She provides just the right amount of encouragement without being patronizing.  And she's all about form so she takes time out to say what position each part of your body should be in as you do the exercise.  I sweated and breathed hard but I feel really good.

The exercises can be challenging but each one is only 30-60 seconds long, so anyone can get through it. Jackie incorporates a bit of cardio after each strength exercise to get your heartbeat up, and it's also motivating to see the trainer's muscles while you're doing the exercises.

Pros: She shows you how to modify each exercise with less intensity or more intensity. She focuses a lot on correct form so that you don't get injured. The person showing you the exercise changes every 5 minutes or so, so it doesn't get boring. Workouts are customizable so you can include lower body, upper body and core in the order you choose, using 1-3 workouts at a time.

Cons: Jackie is a little annoying. It's obvious that she's into herself when she says in a couple of the segments, ""I could do this all day!"" The trainers who demonstrate the exercises can also be corny.",1235865600,,689,4.548387096774194

FINALLY I found Jackie's one-on-one! I am focusing on toning, but all along getting a GREAT cardio workout in 60 minutes (or in even 40 or 20).  Each segment is challenging but fun, I highly recommend this video for a great and efficient workout!",1234483200,,411,4.694444444444445

I LOVE WORK OUT and love Jackie and the trainers so of course when I saw this DVD I had to get it. Today I did it for the first time and honestly I am pretty out of shape compared to what I used to be...I loved this dvd I did all three 20 min workouts together and plan to do them 3 times a week, I have to say by the last 20 min doing core I was pretty exhausted and I am def feeling it. I really think this is going to a great jump start to start shedding these pounds...the dvd is great and you cant pass up the price. I am def excited to see what Jackie can come up with next, I would love to see something more intense, like a great cardio DVD to really burn some calories!! You have to get this DVD!",1234051200,,936,3.854922279792746
3378537,5,B0015D20FY,Love this work out.  The warm up is quick just the way i like it and the 20 minutes on each section go by pretty fast. you may need to lower your weight from the weight you usually use because each set is 1 minute.  that minutes seems like 3 minutes.

3378539,4,B0015D20FY,"Overall, I liked this workout for the variety of moves and challenge provided - hence 4 stars. I would say definitely not for beginners though. The big gripe I have is that the moves are not in time with the music - they are mostly off the beat or a mix of off and on the beat so hard to get used to - I just went at my own pace to avoid annoyance with this. The second gripe is that some moves I think are way too fast to be safe. In particular, the roll to the side with both legs - again you can just slow up to modify. All that said it is a solid 3-set workout and the 20 mins per set has you feeling it.",1233619200,2,608,3.6846153846153844

It also has a feature where you can select which workout you want to do together if you decide to. I must admit that even though each workout is 20 minutes it's a hard workout since you have to do each move for a minute and it makes you realize how long a minute really is.,1233273600,5,369,3.7435897435897436

I wouldn't recommend for beginners - it moves quickly with no breaks and even the modified versions are tough.  I love Jackie and the trainers are fun - their AMAZING bodies are a HUGE motivation!!  Highly highly highly recommend!!!!,1233187200,,388,4.803030303030303
3378542,5,B0015D20FY,"I could not wait to get this DVD! First let me say that 2 weeks ago, my body was aching alot more than it normal does. I am obese at 5'10 and 290. So I mustered the courage to get on the scale and saw that I had put on 20 pounds (was 270). That night I thought to myself ""oh he#@ no"" and went through my kitchen and threw out the chips, chocolate cookies and everything that had sugar in it. Jackie says that sugar is the devil!
I am now eating grilled fish and chicken with green salad, using olive oil and lemon juice as dressing.  I have increased my water intake to about 3 liters a day where as before that is how much pepsi I would drink.  Looking back i'm thankful that I never got diabetes.

So my dvd arrived! I started out with core because I think it will help with lower back pain. I know the weight pulls at my spine. AND OH!!! the core workout had me catching cramps in those muscles that I never use. I somehow ended up in the floor curled up in the fetal position from the pain. Luckily my hubby was at home and reminded me of the ""cobra"" stretch in yoga and that worked the cramp right out. I started the dvd over and actually got through the whole 20 minute core section and have done it few more times. I feel better now and it almost seems weird but the more i work on the core, the less i want to eat. Granted I started out eating an embarassing 3,200 calories a day, now i eat about 1,400-1,500 and am down from 290 lbs. to 278 lbs.

Something about it is different this time. I have made a true commitment! My hubby thinks its so sexy when he sees me working out! LOL
I'm not even at my goal of 170lbs. and he can't keep his hands off!

I strongly recommend the dvd to anyone. My body still aches but for a totally different reason now> And I am seeing results and my self- confidence is beginning to shoot through the roof!",1233100800,7,1847,4.03551912568306
3378543,5,B0015D20FY,"After doing this workout 3 times a week for a month, I can honestly say it works.  I'm impressed with the results I'm getting in a relatively short amount of time.  My arms, shoulders, and legs are showing nice definition.  My abs are a work in progress.  Even though I don't have a six pack at this time, my abdominal bed has gotten a lot stronger.

I like that I can customize my workout depending on how much time I have.  I try to do the 60 minute workout in it's entirety but when time is limited, it's good to know that I can break it up throughout the day.

For those who complained about the airbrushed six packs, the lighting that is used during filming tends to wash out all details.  That's why the abs are shaded in.  The same thing happens with eyebrows.  In that kind of lighting, it is necessary.  If you look at all the cast members, they all have a low fat percentage so they more than likely have six packs but they wouldn't show up under those lighting conditions.

I also wasn't put off by the fact that Jackie isn't doing the workouts.  She's there as a trainer.  If you were to hire a personal trainer, they would coach you during your workouts but they're not going to do them with you.

I judge a workout by how effective it is.  I don't care about the background or the music.  I just want a workout that gives me results.  This workout definitely is giving me the results.  It is a good addition to my workout DVDs collection.",1233014400,,1452,4.252747252747253

I did the whole 60 min. because it was such a good work out that I hated to stop.  You can break it up into the 20 minute intervals though if you like.  This will for sure be one of my favorites , if not my very favorite.  I like the ones that really work your body. What's the point in doing a DVD if you can't reap the benefits of it?!

This DVD is the perfect addition to my weekly workouts. I love how you can modify or increase resistance. For instance, I played it conservative with the amount of weights for the upper body and next time I'll use more, but since my abs are weaker, I did the modifications. Very customized and I like how it sets a ""bar"" to work up to with the more intense versions of all the exercises. I love Gilad, but this is definitely an ultimate body sculpt too!",1231977600,,641,4.440677966101695

Each workout is 20 min and it includes cardio between strength training which is great for beginners or advanced that are looking for a change in routine and fat loss with sculpting the muscles.  I took this on vacation and used my own body weight or resistance bands and it was perfect.  No excuse to not workout because it's easy to do anywhere as long as you have a DVD player!

This DVD has it all with upper body, lower body and core workouts featuring Jackie and four of the instructors from the Bravo series Work Out, Jesse, Rebecca, Augustina and Renessa.  All of the exercises are pretty intense and if you haven't worked out in a while you'll need to take it slow and work up to full speed.

I have a large collection of exercise DVD's but this is one of the most serious, and based on my pain this morning, one of the most effective ones.  It's fun to watch and not one that will get old quickly.  Having seen the instructors on the TV show adds interest to the work out.  Highly recommended.",1231459200,,709,4.366412213740458
3378551,5,B0015D20FY,"Jackie Warner's ""Workout"" is one of my favorite workout dvds right now.  The other is Jillian Michaels's ""30 Day Shred.""  My main form of exercise in the past was running, but I reluctantly gave it up when my knees became a limitation (I like to workout hard almost every day but my knees can't take the punishment of even slow running more than a few times a week).  Also, running takes a lot of time, and, as a dad to a newborn, I do not have a spare hour except after dark, which is a miserable time to run in the winter.  ""Workout"" is a perfect replacement for me because it offers three hard workouts that I can do at home in the evening regardless of the conditions outside.  The workouts each take all of twenty minutes and allow me to push hard without experiencing any knee pain.  After logging in dozens of workouts with Jackie and her crew, I feel leaner and stronger than I ever did as a plodding runner.",1231459200,3,916,4.296511627906977

I thought that the filming was amateurish; the choreography was lame and neither Jackie nor her trainers could keep a beat to save their lives.  If I was new to exercising and used this DVD as a guide, if I paid any attention to Rebecca, I would wind up with the worst form on the planet.  I would also have no clue as to what I was doing because I felt that the explanation that went with each exercise was strongly lacking in detail.  In summary, this DVD was a HUGE letdown.

Within two weeks of doing the workout (3-4x/week), I noticed results. The subscription ended after three weeks, so I ordered the DVD because I knew I wouldn't keep up with the routine otherwise. Best $10 I have ever spent! For only 20 minutes per body part, you can't go wrong. I continue to see results and am very pleased with the routine. Some tend to get monotonous but this workout is easy to follow and Jackie offers an array of exercises to keep you moving and motivated. I must admit, I've only done the upper body and abs portion of ""Workout"" but I am sure the lower body excercises will be just as beneficial to you as the other two have been for me. A definite BUY!

The video uses a combination of your own body weight and free weights so if you don't have weights, buy some! Nothing too heavy (at least not at the beginning) - five pound free weights will suffice.",1231113600,,1039,4.411458333333333

Great exercise DVD and time goes by very fast since it's only a minute per exercise. I am doing this DVD(the 3 parts) 3 times a week for almost a month, and I am seeing changes in the way my upper body looks. My shoulders and back are looking more defined.

I did 20 min a day and alternated between core, lower body, and upper body.  I recommend getting a good set of hand weights for this dvd.  The best thing about this dvd, she uses weight training and cardo, and there are different levels of each movement, and for each targeted area you work every muscle group.  Its the best!!!

This workout is one that can be done by all fitness levels. I normally think I'm pretty intermediate, but found myself using the beginner's modifications on the core section. It's nice to have something to work up to, I suppose.

I recommend this as an exerciser who is constantly seeking out new routines, as a person who lives in a cold climate and doesn't always feel like going to the gym to get a good workout, and finally as a Bravo junkie.",1230768000,3,718,4.473282442748092

I have a gym membership, and I'll go and do cardio but I like to come home to work out with this video, especially the abs.  The abs is really tough and I have no doubt that doing this ab workout three times a week will get me to having those abs I've always wanted.  I highly recommend it.  I also recommend the Crunch Bootcamp, but it does a whole body workout, so you'll need a day of rest in between strenght training because you can't separate the workout.",1230681600,,765,4.263888888888889

I love that the whole workout is so fast paced because it makes it harder to get lazy and give up, you just want to finish since every exercise is only a minute long. But don't let that fool you, that minute can really be hard. I went through the entire workout but at the core I was so tired and in pain (I'm a beginner) that I kinda gave up here and there but it's definitely something you need to work up to. The core is the hardest one since you really need to focus on form so maybe I'll switch and do it first next time. I do feel much better today though. I'm at 120 lbs and a little out of shape so this video will definitely get me toned up and that's all I want. And the bits of cardio that Jackie puts in the middle of each set are a plus. Overall this is a good video. The hour just flies by and in the end you feel good about yourself that all areas have been targeted. The price definitely beats gym prices and the inconvenience of actually taking out time to go to classes makes this an excellent investment. This is a perfect video to get toned up and get your heart rate pumped up (for those ppl who have a sedentary lifestyle like me).

Usually there is always some truth to the negative reviews...but after getting this DVD....I see there is alot of ""haters"" out there....

Or maybe its the guy she fired from Skysport making up negative reviews to hurt her sales...

Let me just say....this video is hard....not impossible..but hard....for the intermediate...although a beginner has the modified versions that they can work with.

You feel it....

As a person who is an avid runner....I love when I feel similar pain .. that feeling of  muscle fatigue.....although not howling in agony..I do feel a resulting  stiffness with this dvd..

There are some great twists on the traditional excercises....and some new ones that work great...

I wouldnt compare it to the Biggest Loser DVD...apples and oranges...due to the words of motivation and the trainers.

If you watch the Biggest Loser...you know that these are really obese people who need to be nurtured and loved...to achieve their goals...

Jackie's video assumes that you have passed that stage ..and are ready for the next level- that you just need alittle coaching to get you through

They are both great videos....

I would say this video...is like P90x ..but not cheesy and not as intense...

I thought the lower body section was the most intense, with lots of lunges, squats, and cardio sections that repeated movements from the weight training (like plyometric squats).  I was glad the core section is 20 minutes and more intense than some of the shorter, 10-minute workouts I have.  Definitely felt it!

The upper body sections hits everything, back, shoulders, triceps, etc., but seemed to just touch on each body part and not really fully work any individual muscle.  I was a bit disappointed with this section, but then, they are trying to fit a lot into 20 minutes.

The instructors in this DVD are a bit lacking in personality.  They aren't the most motivating or fun bunch to lead a workout, but their form and instruction is good. One lady's bizarre bra-with-a-vest outfit was a bit distracting (who dresses like that to work out...or ever?)

This is one of my favorites so far because it doesn't seem like an hour of exercise (at least not until the next day!).  I like the fact that she spends a full minute on each exercise instead of just 10-12 reps.  You have time to work on form and really get it right.

3378566,5,B0015D20FY,"I work out at a health club (cardio and circuit), but not regularly enough to achieve good results (at age 40+), so I was looking for a flexible at-home solution to augment the health club.

I'll give that the Bravo reality show ""Workout"" was entertaining and motivating (The Good). I'll give that reality shows in general can muck up their stars' credibility or image (The Bad.) I'll also give that the episode where Jackie cattily snickered about a client's cleavage was disappointing (The Ugly).

In protest, and becasuse I'd heard good things, I tried Jillian Michaels's ""30 Day Shred""--but found her Level 2 style a tad abrasive and belittling. (If her routines are going to torment me physically, don't need to augment that with low self-esteem because I can't keep up with her grueling routines or burn that stubborn fat. Found myself cussing back at her on the TV...)!

So I revisited Jackie Warner's ""Workout: One-on-One Training."" Figured with a successful Beverly Hills fitness club and a rock-hard body at 40 (that my sister enviously insists is from surgery because no one over 35 looks that good without it), Jackie must be doing something right. I started with the 20-minute Core routine every morning, with the Upper-Body routine every other morning. (As mentioned in other reviews--there are three 20-min. workouts--core, upper body, lower body. I have lower-back and knee issues, so I shy away from high-impact lower-body routines.)

Bottom line:  It works!

In 6 months:  lost 8 lbs, 3"" from waist, 2"" from hips, 4"" from ribcage, arms and abs more sculpted than 2 decades of health club. 6 months later, I still burn (adding ankle weights and a balancing disc for core + increasing weights for upper body keeps it effective.)

PROS: Schedule flexibility (quick 20 minutes daily, or all 60 3x/week); includes warm-up and cooldown stretches + beginning/advanced modifications; motivating, personable coaching (Jackie is encouraging, but sometimes forgets to address her at-home viewer-clients); fairly good job emphasizing good form throughout DVD; includes 1-minute cardio-burst moves (more effective than just the routines--just don't expect it to be a substitute for cardio workout--it isn't).

CONS: Moves fast, lack of clear instruction from one routine to next (example: stands up between modified plank and bicycles--both floor routines, so keep the remote pause/rewind handy until you learn the routines); doesn't emphasize good core form throughout core routine (i.e., press belly inward to spine, spine into floor); some routines change timing/don't keep time w/music; severe lower-back strain with some upper-body moves where you bend over with weights (bent-over rows, rear-delt flys, alternating one-arm row--try over exercise ball or bedside/sofaside to support lower back).

RECOMMENED? Absolutely! (Esp. for beginners/intermediate fitness-seekers.)",1227225600,7,2881,5.439461883408072

3378571,2,B0015D20FY,"I've never seen an episode of ""Work Out"" but I was looking for a good interval training DVD with weights and thought this one work do the trick.

Pros:

I like that you can break the video up into Arms/Legs/Abs. Even though I prefer working large and small muscles at the same time. It's nice to be able to work just one area at a time.

Cons:

There are too many trainers just sitting around during the workout. I think it would have been nice if at least one of them was demonstrating alternate ways to do the exercise for the viewer.

On my HD television, you can see the makeup that one of the trainers is wearing on her abs quite clearly and, in general, the porny baby voiced trainers do nothing for me. Since I don't watch the show, I'm wondering if this is really the best Sky Gym has to present.

Jackie is an average to mediocre coach. She doesn't cue well, engages in annoying chit chat with her trainers, and doesn't point out form in a way that is useful for the viewer. Also, there is very little explanation of the moves before the trainer begins doing them.

The upper body workout was good with some unique moves but the lower body workout was really lacking IMO. I didn't feel like I got a good workout after completing it.

I can't help but compare this DVD to Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred because both are well known TV trainers with great bodies that seem to make all the ladies swoon. Also, both DVDs are shot on the exact same set.

Of the two, I prefer ""30 Day Shred."" After checking both out from the library, it is the one I ended up buying.",1226102400,70,1569,4.255892255892256
3378572,4,B0015D20FY,"I tried this DVD based on the good reviews and I feel I got my money's worth.  I'm always looking for new toning DVDs so I can vary my workouts.  I found that the upper and lower body sections were good, but not as advanced as I would have liked.  That being said, she did throw in some new moves I've never seen before so it's definitely great for variety.  The core section on the other hand was TOUGH.  It may have been the same intensity as the other 2 sections, but that's my weakest area so I really felt this one.  I saw a couple of reviews complaining about the lack of real cardio.  This is a toning DVD with a little cardio thrown in to give you a little break from the strength training.  Don't buy this if you're looking for a cardio workout.  I reccommend it though if you're looking to do some toning.

EDIT: I wrote this review the morning I did the lower body workout.  It is now the next day and I am majorly feeling this workout.  I would change my rating to 5 Stars.",1225843200,,985,4.099476439790576

It's okay but I have bought better exercise DVD's like Jillian Michaels '30 Day Shred'.

These routines are definitely not for beginners - I'm a fairly fit person, and was definitely feeling sore the day after I first tried out this video. Each segment is 20 minutes and the 20 minutes always fly by! Jackie and her fellow trainers are energetic and do a great job of motivating you to keep going. The workouts can easily be adjusted to be more or less intense by varying the weights that you use.

I definitely recommend this video to anyone who can become bored with slow-moving workout videos and who wants to see results quickly!",1224028800,,698,4.410852713178294

When I first tried it I couldn't do some of the exercises for as long as she did but now I can.  When you first do it you will be very sore the next day but it feels good to know you are working muscles that you normally don't.  It's very fast paced and goes by quickly and you will work up a good sweat.  Love that each section is just 20 minutes.  Jackie says you should do it 3x a week or one section per day.  I'm working up to the 3x a week.  The abs/core section has one trainer showing you a modified less difficult version and one trainer showing a more advanced version.  It's great though cause you can always increase or lower the intensity by increasing  or lowering your weights.  If you like working out at home this is a great DVD for that.  You will get an awesome workout!,1222819200,,879,4.023121387283237

3378578,4,B0015D20FY,"This is a great video for beginners, as Jackie does teach you several basic ""staples"" to have in your lifting collection.  Jackie breaks it down into three sections: upper body, lower body, and core.  She then goes through several moves with 1 trainer at a time (except for the core portion), commenting on form and other elements of the exercise.  The moves are then followed by a brief cardio portion (2 minutes).  The cardio ranges from ski bunnies to jumping jacks to jabs.

Overall, its a good video, although I expected more from it.  I know on the show, Jackie does say she didn't prepare enough for this video & it definately shows.  Still, it is a good beginning video, and I found the abs portion to be pretty challenging.",1221609600,,732,4.584615384615384

The 1 minute break-ups, low impact cardio (although it is sometimes higher impact someone is always performing a less strenuous rep) make it a GREAT re-intro into the workout world.  The 20 minute sections make it possible to do one or all--time and ability being a factor.  I've ordered 15 DVD's in the past two weeks and most of them are high impact and totally disregard knee, hip and back problems caused by high impact.  Jackie is right on with no time wasted and easy to follow directives.  Can't wait to see what she comes out with next. J Lang",1221264000,2,632,4.413793103448276

I also love that it is segmented into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Core, and that you can do one at a time or combine them any way you like.  That is a great feature for people who may only have a short time for working out and who like to rotate which body parts they strengthen on each day.

This is sort of unrelated to the quality of the workouts, but being a fan of the show, I like watching the interplay between Jackie and her staff.  I feel almost like I'm working out with friends.  Really, really, really fit friends.

I tend to buy a lot of workout videos and never use them, and this is one I keep coming back to both for challenge and convenience (nice short hard workouts are the way to go).  Great job Jackie!",1220918400,5,994,4.061538461538461

In 3 weeks I have definitely seen new definition that I did not get with the Firm workouts.  It's fun watching her with the other trainers.  This is good for beginners or advanced.

The lower-body segment moves pretty fast, so I'd recommend that newbies practice correct lunge form before beginning the segment.

I bought the DVD to ensure I can continue if its not on demand anymore.  The  ONLY reason I gave it 4 instead of 5, is there are a few confusing cues and directions along the way.  In the upper portion...she states several times that you either ""should never lean back on these exercises"" or ""should never lean forward"".  A little confusing, which would be even worse if someone were new to this type of exercise.

To build on what other reviewers have said, these are just really effective, doable workouts that offer modifications for people at every level of fitness.  I love Jackie's manner in these workouts, and really feel encouraged when she's telling ""me"" that I can do it.  (Normally I curse instructors under my breath while I'm exercising, so this is a sign that she's pretty effective in providing motivation!)

Many of the exercises featured in these workouts can also be found in other programs, so they're obviously considered effective.  I was definitely sore in the beginning, though in time my body has adjusted to the workouts.  My solution is to take a week or two off of Jackie's workouts, trying something like dance or other whole body exercise programs.

You get different levels to choose from when working out by following one of the instructors.

Jackie makes it fun. She mixes up your work out with boxing, aerobics, and other different types of exercise.

I learned some new exercise moves with this DVD. I like that as the same old same old can get boring. You feel special working out with this group as they are located in the exclusive Beverly Hills and people pay an astronomical price to work out with them. You are getting all of the ""secrets"" for a VERY reasonable price.

Lots of lunges and Squats which are very effective.  I liked that workout so much I decided to try the upper body the same morning.  I used about 5 to 8 lb.  weights. she covers all the chest, back and arm groups.  What I Like best about all of these is that Jackie puts cardio in about every three ot four minutes.  Quick little bursts of cardio definitely keep your heart rate going.  I feel like I get a good mix of strength training and cardio.

Also, the workouts cover all of your muscle groups.

THE BAD: Although there are modifications for some of the exercises you would still have to understand good form to make sure you execute them correctly - most of the instructions she gives are pretty quick.  The painted-on abs is pretty cheesy and the 'team work' attitude was so fake.

I do all three now and it takes the full hour, but as I tone and firm I plan to cut it back to core and upper body, then core and lower body.  Her instructions are very clear and she helps you keep focus on your form while also encouraging you to hang in there!

I LOVE the fact that I can pick and choose which ones on certain days, or do all three if I choose. Very pleased with the video and will continue to use.",1216080000,,465,4.614457831325301

The video has various levels of strength incorporated so you can make the workout fit your own personal level.  I love it.  It's a great video to have if some days you just don't have the motivation to leave your house for the gym.  Because you can get just as good a workout (or even better) right at home.,1215907200,,441,4.0813953488372094

This DVD workout will leave you sore, but motivated. It's very simple and gets right to the point - each 20 minute section works one part of your body (upper, lower, core/abs) very efficiently. I like that part because I don't have much time to work out, so I want to be able to target a specific part of my body, raise my heart rate, and then be able to do a different part the next day. There are also modifications on most of the exercises for people who, like me, haven't done much working out in the past and are not in super great shape.

There is an upper body work out, a core work out and a lower work out. Jackie focuses on the form of each exercise, first demonstrating it, and then using a trainer's form to illustrate. When she tells you which muscle each movement is designed to address, there isn't any doubt as evidenced by the burn you feel. Each exercise is then shown in it's modified or increased intensity form. I couldn't be happier with this DVD and am well on my way to becoming more fit.",1215475200,,726,4.425373134328358

One thing that challenged me was keeping up with the cardio in the lower body work out. If it got tought, I resolved to marching in place just to keep from stopping.

Overall, the upper body work out was my favorite, really worked the triceps and those are hard to reach.

It is challenging and I can get it done in the time that I have.  One 20 minute is even short enough to do while my kids are awake and playing.  Each workout is challenging- even for those really fit people.  I like doing 2 back to back.  It is fast paced and Jackie is great (not like most annoying dvd workouts).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I bought this video 1 month ago and I do all three segments in one shot 3-4 times/week (never 2 days in a row).  I am seeing awesome results and love watching my body change!

This dvd does everything right: the exercises are really effective (you feel them!), you break a sweat, and there's modifications for beginners and advanced viewers.  The 3 20-minute segments are great because you can program however many segments you want to do.  Jackie is a great teacher because she motivates you but isn't cheesy, hyper, or annoying.

3378649,5,B0015D20FY,"As a fan of Jackie's Work Out series, I was looking forward to getting a taste of what it is she actually does.  And I'm not disappointed.

I would recommend this workout to any beginner or intermediate excerciser because Jackie does a great job of explaining the form and technique for each excercise.  And as someone who still has trouble perfecting the proper form of a squat, I really appreciate it.  She's also enthusiastic without being annoyingly perky.  Same with her trainers.  Each of her 4 trainers is featured during every workout and they are very likeable without being annoying.  Also, if you watch the show, you will recognize a few of their personality traits emerging (especially Rebecca) as they workout with Jackie.

The workouts are grouped into 3 separate areas, upper body, lower body, and core.  You can build your own workout in whatever combination you like.  Each is 20 minutes long, which for me is the perfect amount of time to get in some strength training during the day.  You need minimal equipment -- just handweights.  I've done each workout so far, and I plan on continuing until it bores me (as all workouts eventually do).  Still, this one was under $10 bucks when I bought it from Amazon, and it is well worth the money, even if I tire of it in a a few months.  I would recommend it to anyone.",1214870400,,1331,4.608510638297872

The various moves, time of repetitions and overall continuous movement are something you have to work towards.  I thought I was in pretty good condition until I tried this video.

Just like the show, Jackie has a good approach and style - she pushes you, and stays on track, but she is encouraging.  I like the modified Core work-out too as some of the harder exercises are hard on the back.  The video at times seems a little thrown together and slightly unprofessional, but not a big deal.  I like the break-out into 3 different routines.  My favorite is the Core.  I think if I stick with it religiously I may obtain those elusive 6-pack abs someday!",1214524800,,646,4.517241379310345

It moves at a fast pace and I like that you don't do too much of one thing, it keeps moving.  Right about when you think you can't do anymore, your done.  I must mention that I am VERY out of shape and I could only make it through the upper body segment and a small part of lower body on my first try but I am eager to try again because it was actually kind of fun.  Time went by fast while doing this.  Jackie really mixes it up so you don't get bored.  I like the core segment- She gives lots of alternative ways to work your middle other than boring crunches-which I hate.  I like that when Jackie says your almost there, you actually are almost there.  Nothing more annoying than trainers who tease you.

And boy was I surprised by the utterly low price been offered by Amazon so of course I ordered it along with Jillian Michael's 30 day shred. Even though I am not overly impressed with the 30 day shred due in large part to Ms. Michael's amazingly dull and annoying personality I can say the complete opposite of Jackie. Her motivational spirit which is already evident from the show and her patient yet informative way of training is definitely one to be desired. In short I would recommend this to everyone, it is a great workout in a short amount of time without the usual boredom of a lot of other workout tapes (trust me I own quite a lot). Bravo!

3378669,5,B0015D20FY,"Jackie Warner was born in 1969 in Fairborn, Ohio. She's a fitness trainer  and owner of Sky Sport and Spa in Beverly Hills, California.

For those of you who have never seen her, she rocks. Nearly forty, she looks great. And she knows how to train people. In fact, she trains stars in Hollywood.

I love this video. Jackie has an engaging personality that makes you want to push yourself and enjoy what you're doing.

I timed each session and they run true to what they say . . . twenty minutes each.

The instructors consist of Jackie, three of her female trainers and one of her male trainer.

The video starts off with a short promo for her show on Bravo. That's okay as the video isn't expensive. But when you pay for something, I prefer not to pay for an advertisement. It's short, however. You may not even notice it.

The upper body is high reps and lighter weights. I'm used to heavy weights and low reps. But this is better for older people and it's great toning and cardio. If you want to go for muscle mass, you'll have to go another route.

This is really fast-paced. But the exercises are broken up in minutes. So you don't get overly tired. At the same time, you burn fat and get toned.

The music is good for working out. It's not too loud but you're aware of it. It keeps good time to the workout.

Jackie gives good instruction. She is, after all, a true expert at getting people into shape.

This is not a girlie girl workout. No aerobics. I like that. There are a few jumping jacks and military-like cardio moves; some boxing moves. These are great and done in short spurts.

Jackie tells which muscles are being engaged in each exercise.

Each workout ends with a stretch, which is really necessary and good. It's a great cool down and allows your heart rate to go down and muscles to relax.

Some instructors have you stretch before the workout with weights. I'm not sure which is best. But I prefer to do it afterwords.

The only equipment you need is a mat and your choice of dumbbells. You'll want the weights to be light enough to use for one minute or so for each exercise but heavy enough to tone. So it totally depends on your current strength. You might hurt yourself if you go too heavy. So it's better to go lighter than you think you need until you do the workout at least one time.

The important thing is, you'll burn fat and tone up.

The video is broken up into three twenty-minute workouts. The first one is for the upper body. The second one is for the lower body and the third is for the abs and core.

Twenty minutes isn't a long time. But you'll know you've had a workout after any one of these. Of course, those brave and hardy souls who just have to go gung ho can do more than one session if they choose.

One thing I like about the lower body workout is that the lunges are not deep so they're easy on the knees. After the warm up there are sixty second squats. These really work the gluts, hamstrings and quads.

Then you'll do a front lunge. Again, you don't need to go deep. And, you can add weights for extra resistance if you want. Advanced exercisers will probably want to.

This is really a full body workout.

Jackie tells you how to keep your posture, your form. Jackie says on the video that you'll want to increase your weights as you do the workouts more often.

You'll get cardio in the lower body workout too. Between the weight sessions is a short period of fast cardio. Generally boxing and jumping routines.

You'll engage your abs in most of the exercises.

""You can do anything for a minute,"" Jackie tells the viewer. And that's true.

I suggest you watch the video before you do any of the workouts. That way you'll know where you might want to modify.

The lower body workout, like the previous one, ends with a stretch. A few of the poses are wonderful yoga poses, such as the child's pose. Then, you go into the pigeon, another wonderful yoga pose and it feels so good.

The ab/core session begins with a nice warm up. Then, Jackie leads the team in crunches. Here I have a minor problem. Jackie has been quoted as saying she did not do crunches. She has fantastic abs to be sure. But her claim is she does not do crunches herself.

To quote Jackie herself, ""I actually do not do crunches. This is one of my buzz phrases, `Crunches are a waste of time.'

She continues, ""Crunches are not going to get those abs. How you get those abs are actually lifting with a big muscle group such as chest, back, legs and butt. The more muscle that you have on your frame, the more fat you literally lose or shrink.""

But, in all honesty, this video has only a few crunches. The rest of the ad/core workout uses such things as the plank and twist.

I've found that most all weight lifting and body work uses the abs. And strong abs are important. There just not for looks. You need them to lift groceries, the baby and even to reach things on high shelves. Notice sometime when you do these things . . . you'll feel your abs if you have good strong ones.

I judge the core/ab workout as excellent. It combines yoga poses with some really tough exercises and they really engage the abs. You'll also get cardio. You'll get the burn. And you'll burn fat and build muscle.

Of course, this session, like all of the others, ends in a nice stretch session.

The ab work is very effective and it works.

I rate this 5 stars. It's terrific for any level except hard core weight lifters. And it's good for men and women both although I expect more women will want this video.

It's not aerobic. It's a real workout and I believe you'll get real results if you do it.

Highly recommended.

3378670,4,B0015D20FY,"This workout tape is split into three 20-minute routines; one for upper body; another for lower body and one for abdominals/core.  Each routine is very intense.  I think that overall this is a good workout tape, however, some of the exercises are done too fast.  For example on the lower body workout, they do a series of front and backward split lunges.  To do these properly and without hurting yourself, you need to concentrate on form, not speed.  I don't think Jackie does much to emphasize form over speed and therefore, this is definitely not for the out of shape or beginner exerciser.",1214179200,3,593,4.718446601941747

3378675,5,B0015D20FY,"I worked with a personal trainer for two months in the past and of the three weight training DVDs I've tried so far, this is the closest I've come to having that personal trainer again.

I tried this DVD last night, and let me tell you, I couldn't keep up! I had to pause the DVD a couple times to walk around and catch my breath, and sometimes I could not keep up for the full minute during the workout because of the burning. This was mostly with the modified version of the workouts. Despite the toughness, you do get a better workout because Jackie is very encouraging and motivating. She would frequently tell the home viewers that they could do it and to keep going, almost done, keep going even if you can't reach as high or go slower than the trainer in the video, and so on. I was definitely sore today from that workout in most of my body(biceps, triceps, quads, delts, traps, etc). It's also great because over time I can switch from the modified version to the normal version, and for some workouts, the advanced version. I can also increase the weights I use to increase the toughness.

I'm very happy I found this DVD because I found something that is challenging to do during the workout, it made me sore afterwards so I know I'm growing muscles, and I know I will be able to make the workouts tougher for myself as I get in better shape over time. And best of all - I don't need to pay a trainer $xx/hour for it and a gym $xx/month, just the one-time cost of the DVD and a couple weights & pad I already owned. :)",1213747200,2,2331,5.147757255936676

They do them for ONE Minute, then do some little cardio Move for a Minute and then back to excersises, so You do Get a Good Work Out.. Good for the MONEY  There were a few excercises in there that i Had never seen before.  and You Do SWEAT, and it does target Muscles..  What I Liked about it was You could Keep Up, and Not get Lost in fancy footwork type stuff, as a Lot cardio DVD 's do to me.. Id say for the MONEY ........its worth it.  But you probably watch it twice  maybe three times and memorize it... and be done. I did Hurt the Next day after doing it, so I feel It WORKS",1213747200,7,695,3.852112676056338
3378687,5,B0015D20FY,"This is a tough workout.  I exercise with weights regularly, and I was sore the next day in ways I haven't been in a while!  These workouts are short, but they are non-stop and packed with different exercises.  The 20 minutes (or so) goes by fast because there are no breaks at all - you do two or three weight lifting exercises and then go into a minute of cardio.  Most of the weight lifting exercises are a minute of each type (for example, one minute of squats, then one minute of lunges).  The exercises are basic enough, so you don't have to be an expert to do them, but you do have to work out regularly to keep up, as well as to know which weights to use with each exercise, since they don't offer advice on this (light vs. heavier, etc.).

The only minor problems I have are with the warm-up/cool-downs and the form of some of the trainers.  The warm-up and cool-downs are very short, so it would probably be wise to do a little more of each on your own.  Also, sometimes the trainers are doing the exercises so fast they they jerk around and appear to use bad form.  For example, one of the girls is doing squats so fast that she's basically popping up and locking her knees at the top - from what I've learned on other videos, this is bad.  Since I know proper form, this isn't a problem for me, but it could be bad for people who are new to these types of exercises.

All in all though, it is a really good, no-nonsense workout with good variety.",1213747200,5,1458,4.2086330935251794

It really is like having your own personal trainer in your home. I try to do all 3 sequences in one shot and it is very challenging but well worth the results. I like the option to break the workout up if I only have time to do one or two sequences. I always see a difference in my shape the day after doing this video. Jackie does a great job explaining form and the trainers simulate each move in a very easy to follow fashion. The price is excellent for such good information.

The first time I tried to do all three, I did the upper and lower body. By the end of the lower body I had to stop cause I literally thought I was going to throw up.

I think had this been a bit better cued this segment would have been better.  I have done this a couple times and liked it better on the second and third attempt then the first.

I am losing a tremendous amount of weight, but I can't get to my gym every day as I have two small daughters. So, I was looking for an exercise program to do at home for the days I can't get to the gym. I love the show ""Workout"" so I decided to order the DVD. It truly is an amazing workout! I was dripping with sweat after the first 20-minute session. I love how there are 3 sessions so I can do one, two, or all three whenver I feel like it. I also did not find this too difficult. I was worried about that since Jackie and her trainers are so fit. But, I am by no means fit and I didn't have a hard time at all. Don't get me wrong - it's hard to do, but it's not too advanced for me. In fact, my 4-year-old daughter even joined me for fun! (Well, fun for her! Not me!)

What I like is that Jackie is encouraging without jumping around, praising Jesus, and screaming like Billy Blanks and his daughter on the Tae Bo workouts. And to the guys, you'll be too distracted from Rebecca, Renessa and the rest. And for the ladies and gay guys, there is requisite hunky muscle guy.

3378698,5,B0015D20FY,"I received this DVD as a gift from a friend who knew I was hooked on Jackie's TV show & wanted her DVD as soon as it came out. As a 50+ woman who was very athletic in her younger years, I have stayed active through various activities including yoga, pilates & dance. I have good weight & muscle tone but needed a little more to fight the ""hormonal change pooch"" & keep my bones strong. The weight training helps keep bones healthy & this workout sure burns off fat! That little layer forming that awful ""pooch"" is melting off nicely. After only 10 days, both hubby & myself can see a noticible difference. I definitely work up a sweat & feel the burn but really feel great afterward. I truly enjoy Jackie's workout & her training style. Although this is not an advanced workout it IS challenging & beginners should definitely modify when they first start to avoid injury. This IS a perfect intermediate workout. Remember, ""You can do anything for one minute!""",1213056000,2,959,4.517241379310345
3378699,5,B0015D20FY,"Like some other reviewers, I am baffled by the 1, 2, and 3 star ratings. This is a really interesting, well-presented, very motivating workout. It's got mods up (watch Jesse) or down (watch Renessa) to help you tailor it to your strengths or weaknesses for individual exercises ... I can do some well, others less so, but I can do the whole deal because of the mods. It's a great workout, with engaging (but not overpowering) music, good cuing, and professional production.

I'm also puzzled by the comparisons to Jillian Michaels. Nothing against her, but her style turns me off. Jackie comes across as wanting you to succeed, and offers a way to get there, but doesn't let you forget why you're doing this in the first place!

I've bought so many disappointing exercise DVDs -- either way too hard or way too easy, or too long, or not something you could really keep doing for the long haul. You can make this DVD into what works for you with the three 20-minute mix-and-match sessions, and the mods make it easy to get started at almost any level, and move onward from there.

This is the first exercise DVD I've found that I'll actually be able to use on an on-going basis. Very good value -- don't hesitate to buy it!",1212883200,14,1222,4.520361990950226

I liked how the segments are divided up and on the main menu you can select the videos that you want to perform, meaning if you want to do just legs and core, you highlight both and when it plays, it leads one segment into the next.

Overall this is more like the boot camp style workout that Jackie talks about on her show.  It has made a nice addition to my other workouts to shake things up a bit.  You will feel it the next day.  The 20minute segments make it great to fit in on those days when you don't have that much time to fit into an entire workout.",1212796800,,659,4.030769230769231

You are shown first how to do a particular exercise and then the trainers show you how you can modify it to make it easier or harder. Jackie is really good about explaining which muscles you are working out with each exercise. Although this may be a bit difficult for a beginner, don't give up its worth it. All that is required are weights and a mat (if you are on a hard floor). Happy exercising!",1212624000,2,473,4.266666666666667

I have used it about 3 times a week for  2 weeks and ALREADY I can see visible results - particularly in my abs. I have NEVER been able to force myself through an entire workout video due to boredom, but Jackie's program has incredible variation and the one-on-one style of the upper and lower body segments simply make the workout FLY by.

For those who are complaining about a lack of cardio in the workout, I recommend wearing a heart rate monitor, especially during the lower body segment. I have found that this workout keeps my heart rate relatively high - only about 10-15 points below my avg while running. I've been doing all three segments at a time, and generally burn at least 550 calories.

This video is INCREDIBLE and my only hope is that Jackie makes MORE!",1212624000,5,845,4.546052631578948

I consider myself to be in decent health and I work out often but this is the first ""conventional"" work out I have ever done. The routines are hard but since each movement is only 1 minute, it doesn't feel so bad. Actually, during the entire work out (60 min), I didn't feel winded or anything. But afterwards when I was finished I could really FEEL every muscle in my stomach and my hips, which felt amazing! AND while doing the dvd, it didn't even feel like it took a hour. I felt like I was only doing it for 20 minutes..which is great...it moves very smoothly and keeps your attention.

I gave this four stars only because I think the airbrushed abs for definition on the trainers is cheesy and unnecessary. However, this does not take away from the quality of the work out. I only recommend that if you need constant motivation to keep going and need a trainer to hold your hand, you might want another video. Jackie does a good job of motivating you but it isn't the first thing she says in a given segment. This is okay because I can keep myself motivated, but if you can't look elsewhere.",1212537600,9,1173,4.283783783783784

I am 49 years old, and intermediate-to-advanced.  Whenever I try a new workout, it's usually either too easy or frustratingly difficult.  This was perfect!  And the bonus was, even though I workout 3-4 days a week, I was sore in several places the next day!  Wow!  That doesn't happen too much anymore.  I tried it the second time yesterday, and today I am only sore due to the pushups.  But I still really was impressed with the workout.  She gets the job done!  I will say, after viewing other's comments, I have to agree that her trainers' abs certainly do look enhanced with some type of shading.  They are fit enough that I find that insulting to both them and us.  But as far as the workout itself goes, I highly recommend this to anyone.  Beginners can do fewer reps, lighter weights, or do one section at a time.  Advanced can increase weights and do the more advanced modifications she shows.

While I understand what makes someone like or dislike an exercise video is very subjective, it was hard for me to see how someone could *hate* the exercises in this video.  The only thing that I could conclude is that some of the reviews are actually reflecting the reviewer's personal thoughts on the trainer. I'm more interested in the quality of the work-out in the video.  In that regard, I can say that I really like this DVD.  For me to stick with a DVD I need variation and this DVD delivers that.  There are three segments so I can do a different one each morning.  At first I didn't think I'd like the fact that for the upper body and lower body segments she works with one trainer at a time but this wound up being my favorite feature of the video.

I'm a beginner exerciser so I was a little concerned reading the reports that my arms would fall off and I wouldn't be able to move the next day. I walk 50 minutes to get to my schools to teach and I worked it just fine. In fact I even felt better than I usually do. You'll definitely feel the burn though. The only bad thing I can say about Jackie was that I didn't feel as motivated by her. Jillian's ""Work for it! This butt doesn't come for free! Keep pushing! Go deeper now!"" and other phrases actually pumped me up though if I hadn't been working out I probably would have just rolled my eyes. Jackie's relationship with her trainers is more evident and she seems to really motivate them so you're kind of motivated through proxy but it definitely doesn't have the same feeling. Her moves really work though and her energy and focus on good form are good. I'll edit and repost if my feelings change but that's the word for now.",1211932800,6,1024,4.310880829015544

So when I popped it in yesterday I was amazed at how quick yet effective each workout is. Jackie's motto of ""you can do anything for one minute"" really seems strangely motivational. She doesn't yell during the home video like some other trainers, which is a big plus. Her attitude is more ""you can do it"" than ""you better do it while I yell at you to do it longer!"" It is very refreshing. Jackie also points out where you should be feeling the burn in every single exercise, making it easy to determine that you are doing the exercise properly. In addition to being an intermediate level video (which is really difficult to find!) she shows how to progressively make the exercises more difficult, along with doing them for a long period of time.
Really, Jackie's ""you can do anything for a minute"" attitude combined with her knowledge about the body makes for a great video. This is the best $10 I've spent in a while!",1211846400,15,1054,4.355329949238579
3378712,5,B0015D20FY,"This is one of the best workout DVD's I have ever tried.  It is broken down into three twenty minute workouts consisting of the upper body, lower body, and the core.  This is a great idea. Many people complain that they don't have time to workout because most workout videos are about 45 -60 minutes long (some longer!).  This makes it really intimidating when you are trying to start exercising, or if it has been a while since you have had an exercise routine.  But with this DVD, it is hard to find an excuse not to exercise for twenty minutes a day.  And for those of you who workout regularly, you can do all three workouts at a time.

As for each of the three workouts, they are all intense.  Jackie definitely makes each second count.  You get in, get your workout, get out and get on with your day.  I have only been doing this workout for the last four days, but I have already had my energy level shoot up.  I seem to get a lot more done.  I had just recently started working out again, so I have only been doing one of the workouts a day.  I started with the upper body workout.  I have been working out with weights, and thought I was doing pretty well.  But the day after doing this workout, I was sore in muscles I completely forgot I had.  Not so sore that I was useless, but sore enough to remember I had worked out the day before.  The next day I did the lower body workout, and boy was that intense.  There were some moves I had not seen before that really seemed to target the inner thigh.  I was not able to go as deep into every move as the trainers did, but I still felt it the next day.  And of course I did the core workout the next morning.  I definitely had to do the modified version on some moves, but I still reached muscles that have not been worked in years.

I have to say again how much I am enjoying this workout DVD.  It targets every muscle group, and since it is so fast-paced you do get a cardio workout as well.  I find Jackie and her trainers to be highly motivational.  They are all friendly and inspiring.  I will definitely be using this DVD as my main exercise.

20 minutes is good because it's short. But it is intense- Jackie utalizes every second in each routine going from exercise to exercise quickly so you get some cardio in as well as strength training.

The other good thing about this dvd is her trainers show you different variations of all the moves so whether you are a beginner or more advanced you can do each move on your own level.

I do this with Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and the results I'm getting with them is amazing. The main thing with exercise and being successful is you have to stay consistent and don't expect miracle results. Results will come if you continue, don't even give up and be patient. If you do an exercise routine and only give 50%, you will only get 50% results. You get what you put in.",1211500800,9,1001,4.285714285714286

My favorites are the Biggest Loser series, Jillian Michaels routines, and a DVD called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-For-Every-Body-With-Over-35-Routines/dp/B00006RCNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga For Every Body (With Over 35 Routines)</a>. I've lost over twenty pounds and am now  at a healthy weight and can really see the results. I no longer get winded like I used to and am starting to see some great muscle definition.

I can't say enough about how much I like Jackie Warner's new video. One of my favorite things about it is that she has broken down the three routines into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs. So you can alternate days thus giving your muscles time to rest and repair. This is a HUGE draw to me. Each routine is about 21.5 minutes including the warm up and cool down. The warm ups and cool downs are also uniquely designed for each specific workout.

The exercises are quite varied and you feel like you're getting a thorough workout. They are mostly strength training with some cardio interspersed throughout. She also gives you modifications to make the exercises easier or more challenging.

Throughout the routines, Jackie's great about telling you exactly which muscles you're working, why you're working them, and where you should  feel the exercise. Her attention to form is excellent which is so important when you're working out on your own at home and don't have anyone to tell you if you're doing an exercise properly.

This video is definitely going to be a staple in my exercise repertoire. I hope there are more to come because this is exactly what I want in an exercise DVD!",1211414400,10,1837,5.147651006711409

i've reviewed and tried a lot of workouts and workout programs, and this one is the best because it is highly effective and efficient.

she chooses an excellent group of exercises for each area of the body and gives you a tough workout that hits every muscle deeply. however, it's easy to modify for a beginner. just do few reps. on the toughest.

there is no waste of time or effort with too many exercises or exercise combinations that leave you feeling as if some muscles were left out. the warm-ups are quick and easy, and the stretches at the end are also quick and feel good.

what i liked best is that she works your inner thighs with squat and lunge variations that are a lot more pleasant than those old exercises on your side on the floor - and i felt those muscles during the session and the next day.

8258069,5,B0015D20FY,"I bought this in 2008 (and it's 2016) but still it is the video I keep pulling out.  Recently, the abs section on my DVD has gotten damaged so I'll be buying another copy! It is nice for me because it is easy to set small goals: e.g. I'll just start the ""upper body"" section, and then ""I'll just do one more unit/circuit"".  Before I know it, that who section is done and I think: well since I'm already sweaty, I'll do the ""core"" section, too! For me, setting small goals is important because when I achieve them I feel great and then want to do more.  Also, Since I don't often complete the whole video, it is nice that I don't have to always ""start from the beginning""; I can start either with upper body, lower body, or core; I can choose the number of sections and the order of those sections. Love this flexibility!",1474156800,2,820,4.243589743589744
