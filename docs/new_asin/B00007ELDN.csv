7975659,5,B00007ELDN,"I first saw this movie sometime in the late 90s when I accidently rented it at Blockbuster.  It was surprisingly good,  and I continued to rent it when I was in the mood for a good espionage thriller.  Unfortunately, Blockbuster is now gone, and I couldn't find it to view online, so I decided to buy it.  It was delivered fast and efficiently.  Love it. Should be a classic.",1438387200,,375,4.3768115942028984

7975665,4,B00007ELDN,"You've seen _Shawshank Redemption_.  You've seen _Papillon_.  Maybe you've even seen _Captives_.  What if you could find all the wrongful-imprisonment...road-to-freedom-ness of these great movies in something refreshingly different, something to equal the thrills of _Mission Impossible_ and the romance of _Scarlet Letter_?
_Ice Runner_ offers all such pleasures.  More like watching a well-cast British piece than viewing the oft-predictablility of so many big-run films, you'll find yourself swept away by the Siberian-earthiness and mesmerizing depth of these characters.
You'll find the pace and composition of _Ice Runner_ to be enjoyably different, yet never inferior.
But more likely than not, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat; it's a masterfully suspenseful ""what's-next"" with original and unexpected love scenes that you (and your Saturday night date) will not soon forget.",992390400,8,896,5.869230769230769
