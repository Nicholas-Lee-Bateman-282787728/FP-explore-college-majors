7011721,5,B00TJIUHBQ,"As a baseball fan, I've always heard inklings of ""behind the scenes"" escapades.  Scriptwriter Billy Sample based this on his experiences in professional baseball (minor league and major league), so those inklings must be true!  It's fun, especially for a baseball fan, to see what it's like for  players off the field.  Plus, it shows us that their off-the-field experiences aren't so glamorous.  I liked it!",1427068800,,408,5.121212121212121

8702094,1,B00TJIUHBQ,"degrading to women, raunchy language, if the acting had been more professional maybe we could have gotten over the disrepect of women. The writer must have a  dislike for his mother, wife, if their is one and I am hoping he has no daughters. It is disrepectful and also not something as christian to be proud of.",1431734400,,312,4.473684210526316

8702096,4,B00TJIUHBQ,"What a great look at how men talk. Women if you ever wanted an inside peak here is the movie for you. The dialougue is written very well by Mr. Billy Sample, and is very interesting to the very end. Well done, above average acting, and a good story to pay attention too.",1428451200,,270,4.113207547169812
