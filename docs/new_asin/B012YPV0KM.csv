7359390,4,B012YPV0KM,"I only have one complaint and that is how they put the movies in. I hate when they are stacked like that, all together, one on top of the othwr. I'd rather have them separated in disc flaps. But other than that, this is a good deal. It has all of the famous final destination movies I love. They are all pretty gruesome and chilling and will leave you hesitant after. I remember the first time I watched the 1st one and I was scared of planes and every accident that happened, big or small, after, I kept thinking about the cosmic plan death had haha. I still am very weary of rollover coasters. I never would go on them before and sure as heck won't now. And I haven't been back to a tanning bed much since because every time I do, I recall these movies. Lol. Great action, suspense and good acting. Not cheesy b rated movies or stupid special effects. Just the right amount of shock and UUMP moments. Don't watch alone, or before going on a plane, rollover coaster, on a busy freeway...JK.",1455062400,21,991,4.304812834224599

7359395,5,B012YPV0KM,"All 5 movies in one collection for a very low price. Wow How lucky can you get?..These movies are very twisted and shamefully humorous. 7 people are saved from a horrible death because one of the 7 had a vision. They are really lucky,well... not really. They have angered death, who thought everyone was going to die. So one by one, death sneaks up on each survivor and gruesomely gets his property. The original deaths are tamed in comparison to how they finally get it. For instance. In the third movie. Roller coaster accident. two lady survivors are burnt up horribly, screaming and fighting and kicking to get out of a tanning booth. If they only knew they would have preferred the roller coaster. So death stalks each survivor, like a silent breath of air as it reaches out to  ...Oh you get the idea. This collection is a bargain.",1451606400,6,837,4.58

One would expect 5 DVDs holder inside the box set with extra features on each disc...but no, somebody just stacked each disc on top of each other.

7359415,4,B012YPV0KM,"Five movies on three discs for $12 ... not a bad deal!

I'll spare you the plot details because others have described what happens in every movie, I just want to tell you these movies are good scary fun.

There are --enormous-- plot holes, the situations these characters find themselves in are totally unrealistic, there is some dreadful ""acting"" (the fourth movie in the series is particularly awful), the laws of physics are frequently ignored, and the repetition can be a bit much ... but the fun comes from the Rube Goldberg-esque design for each death.

The opening premonition sequences are generally well done and are fairly realistic. The deaths that follow are bizarre and gorey.

Take it for what it is ... Mindless Entertainment for $2.40 + 90 minutes / film.",1508025600,,771,4.818181818181818

Ive always been a fan of the first movie second movie isn't as good but does a good job conecting to the universe and continuing the story. The third and forth movies are pretty paint by number and look cheaply made. The last movie is surprisingly ok still not on par with the first movie but not as bad as the third and forth and has an interesting twist at the end. Over all this movies are at the very least entertaining,1503273600,2,489,4.104166666666667

My only complaint is one that has been echoed here several times is that all the discs are stacked up one on another but I wouldn't let that deter your purchase if you really like these movies. To get around the problem with the dvds arrangement you can purchase empty dvd cases that hold 5 discs without putting them in a stack which is what I did,1487376000,,491,4.23404255319149

7359482,5,B012YPV0KM,"This set has all five films on separate discs, stacked up in a standard DVD case.  It's not too generous with special features, but there are a few.  I had a minor problem with the last disc.  It was fixed by cleaning so I would hesitate to say it was caused by the packaging, but I will say the packaging is annoying as you try to work your way down through the discs.

As for the films themselves, they all follow a pretty standard formula: Protagonist gets vision, escapes disaster with a few friends in tow, and then he/she and said friends are stalked by Death, who hates to be cheated.  While this can get monotonous if you watch them one after another, taken individually it's like watching a puzzle come together.  There are some good effects in place, most of the protagonists are likeable, and some creep factor comes from the (mostly) invisible antagonist (Death).  The death scenes can be pretty gruesome, but they're rarely drawn out.  Tony Todd shows up in three of the five (briefly) to be mysterious and spooky, which is a real plus.

So, overall, this is a good set.",1463443200,14,1083,4.512820512820513

8726774,3,B012YPV0KM,"Pros:
 - All 5 Films
 - Space Saving: 2 films on each of the black disc, one film on the red
 - Price

BLACK Disc Only
- No special features
- Seems they are RW/burned copies of the original films. They have generic names/numbers as the title in the DVD rom. You are asked which film you'd like to watch and if you want sub-titles. That's it.

RED Disc Only
  - Includes Special Features
  - Seems to be the actual Disc (ie menu, etc..); everything looks as it would if you purchased the film on it's own.
  - There are A TON of commercials and previews at the beginning

One photo from the first film, so you can see the quality of them; two from the menu of the black discs and one from the red disc.",1531526400,,702,4.043795620437956
