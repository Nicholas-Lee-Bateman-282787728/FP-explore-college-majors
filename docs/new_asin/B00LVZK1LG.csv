6508261,4,B00LVZK1LG,"Godzilla vs Biollante, one of the most rarest movies that has been widely ask to be release for so long by a lot of fans. Originally this movie was only available in the VHS at the time as well only in Blu-ray and DVD Japanese version only or as a bootleg. After so many years of request by many fans to see this movie officially into the states, The company Echo Bridge heeds the call and manage to release this movie in both Blu-ray and in DVD to the states. However copies of this movie sold really fast and not only that but Echo Bridge lost the rights to it, which again a lot of people though that the movie will never again see a re-release. Enters the company Lionsgate who manage to recover the license of the movie and re-release it again in both Blu-ray and in DVD for everyone to enjoy.

-Story-

The events takes after Godzilla 1984( AKA Godzilla 1985 in the US, another movie that as of yet is not available on the state except on VHS at the time). certain group around the world has been trying to get on there hands some of the Godzilla cells left by the monster for the purpose of creating bio-weapons. In the course of the story we meet on of the characters know as Dr. Shiragami (a scientist trying to make a new for of super plant that could be grow in the worst places that no life form would grow) and her daughter Erika.  Erika dies in a bomb incident which cause Dr. Shiragami to leave and never work on Godzilla cells, however certain events force him to do so which causes him to use the Godzilla cells inside a plant (which he injected some of her daughters cells into it). This creates a new monster know as Biollante: a plant with Godzilla cells and human cells(believe to be holding Dr. Shiragani daughter's spirit or soul in it). While in the meantime, a group of mercenaries trying to get the Godzilla cells causes to release Godzilla from its prison been inside a volcano (again events that happen in Godzilla 1984/1985). This monsters would meet and fight while the military try to find a way to stop Godzilla, which they develop a anti-nuclear bio-weapon that they use against Godzilla and see if it will kill him once and for all. Will the plan work?..will the military succeed in killing Godzilla?, or will the monster Biollante be the one to take down the King of the Monsters?.  time will tell.

-Blu-ray review-

This movie from what i gather is the same one as the one that was release by Echo Bridge last year except for a few things that where change. Do note that i never had the opportunity to purchase the Echo Bridge version but i was able to get some info about it which i can make some comparison in the changes so hope this info helps you if you wish to purchase this movie but video quality and audio im comparing it to my VHS that i posses.

-Box cover(front, side and back): front design cover remains the same except that the remark of ""FIRST TIME ON BLUE-RAY"" that was on the top left corner in Echo Bridges version has been remove in the Lionsgate version and the Miramax logo that was present at the top middle in the Echo Bridge versions has been move to the bottom right corner in the Lionsgate version. The side of the box picture remains the same except that at the bottom that would be ""miramax, echo bridge logo, some numbers and the blu-ray log is now change with the blu-ray logo, miramax and Lionsgate logo in that order instead. The back cover of the box is pretty much the same as the one from the DVD format except that the back cover picture and the description info was shrunk a bit as well the text was accommodated to it a bit more to thet changes( like Lionsgate logo been place and the Echo Bridge logo was remove and such), but other than that remains mostly the same.

-Disc: This is possibly the biggest change, while the disc in the Echo bridge version would show you a Picture of Godzilla vs Biollante back cover in the disc as a cover, the Lionsgate version is just a flat Grey disc with the title of the movie at the top very bland with the little logo trademarks of the monster from said movie in one side while the other side would have the logos of Miramax and Lionsgate. very disappointing really, would have prefer they held the same disc design to Echo Bridge since this is pretty much the same thing straight forward sort of speak.

-Menu: the Lionsgate version remains the same as the Echo Bridge version so no changes here so far.

-Movie runtime: the movie last around 104 mins, this is present in both Echo Bridge and Lionsgate version so there are no changes.

-Video Quality: This is another change that has been done (depending), where as the specification from the blu-ray version of Echo Bridge would be full hight definition 1080p widescreen 16x9 (1.85:1), the Lionsgate version is 16x9 Widescreen (1.78:1), do note that i do not have the Echo bridge version for a full comparison so im using information that i was able to find for this specifications. So far the video quality looks good and very clean in comparison to my VHS version which is terrible. So whether there is a big difference between Echo bridge to this one from Lionsgate version in blu-ray format i can't say much, but compare to the original VHS version i got is pretty much clear as day and night in the difference which im happy with. I just wonder why didn't Lionsgate just re-release the original version of Echo Bridge instead of doing any changes to the quality?, will never know.

-Audio Quality: pretty much remains the same as the Echo Bridge one, the specification are as follow: 5.1 DTS Original Japanese Language, 2.0 DTS Original Japaneses language and the 1.0 Dolby Digital English language. While the Japanese audio sounds very clean and clear, however the English audio is really bad. From what i understand this is also present in the Echo bridge version where the Japanese audio is very clean and clear but the English audio version is bad as well, this is because is the Miramax movie version and there was never a clean version of the English one. However compare to my old VHS version, the auido in the Blu-ray sound a bit better but not by much (it sounds way to low and i have to crank up the volume a lot). I would have love that Echo Bridge(at the time) or Lionsgate(now) would have fix this English audio problem, both had the opportunity and pretty much both of them wasted it.

-Subtitles: present in both Echo Bridge and Lionsgate and are as follow: English translation of on-screen text( this is where there is a lot of signs from billboards and such to translate it for understanding), English subtitles translated from the original Japanese Dialogue(when playing the Japanese audio version setup) and finally the English SDH to match the English audio track (not a surprise for how low of a volume it is).

-Special features: present in both Echo Bridge and Lionsgate which are as follow: ""Making of Godzilla vs Biollante"", an almost 50 min long documentary with some producers and director talking about the development of the move, during this process we see some video footages of the stages, props and as well the tricks they need to pull off on making the movie as well some deleted scenes that got remove or never added to the movie(pretty awesome, specially when seen Biollante in action). And theres the ""Behind the Design"" which consist of a video footage of almost 3 mins long showing us 3 design statue of Biollante which the third one been the rose form use for the move and after that the Super X2 model that was use in the movie. Its cool and all but the ""Behind the Design"" is very weak compare to the Making of Godzilla vs Biollante, wish it had more to show us like concept arts of Biollante(accordingly they say the had hundreds of it so would have been cool to see it) as well the process on creating the Biollante custom prop both Rose form and the Final form, also would have been nice to see how they made the Godzilla custom as well plus the prop models of the ships, vehicles and the Super X2. but other than that the Behind the design is very weak and not the best.

-Conclusion-

While im happy to see this movie getting a re-release thanks to Lionsgate so we can all see it and joy as well to added to our collection, i feel there could have been more improvements but instead they did cut some cornes (like the video quality getting lower(?) as well the disc cover in comparison to Echo bridge version). However i don't know how much of a difference they could have done since this almost pretty much an Echo bridge copy version. Although not perfect, is still a great movie to see and for every Godzilla fan to have. Do i recommend it for what it is? for the price that is now yes so go and get it while you still can before is out of print and scalpers decide to increase the price 3 times that.",1414195200,23,8826,4.452351485148514

6508292,4,B00LVZK1LG,"Godzilla vs. Biollante is a terrific sequel to the definitive Godzilla film Return of Godzilla (Godzilla 1984). It's almost as good and has one of the most interesting and intriguing Godzilla villains ever which is of course Biollante. The main reason I don't give this a 5 is because Biollante isn't featured nearly enough. The other reason is because of the score which frankly isn't very good for the most part especially after the incredible score to Return of Godzilla which is one of the best scores in film history. Godzilla also looks a little different in this one too compared to Return of Godzilla when it's supposed to be a sequel. However, those nitpicks aside, Godzilla vs. Biollante is still a very solid sequel and entry into what was supposed to be a new series of Godzilla films but never happened unfortunately. Watching the original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla, The Return of Godzilla and Godzilla vs. Biollante makes for a great trilogy.",1473724800,,964,4.884146341463414

6508352,5,B00LVZK1LG,I like this movie a lot. It has an interesting idea. A plant grows into a huge killer monster thing. Godzilla is great and as he battled the overgrown hydranga I found myself rooting for him. There is a hilarious guy who shows up throughout the entire movie trying to shoot stuff up. The music's great. You have to get this flick.,1426291200,6,330,4.338709677419355

6508358,2,B00LVZK1LG,"Has, along with Jeff H., finished watching ""Godzilla vs Biollante"" released by Miramax.
""Godzilla vs Biollante"" is perhaps the weakest entry in the Godzilla movies I've watched to date.  At times, it comes across as a loud, over-the-top music video with people just standing aound dumbfounded.
""Godzilla vs Biollante"" opens with Godzilla just finishing up destroying Toyko when an elite squad of American soldiers kill an elite squad of Japanese soliders who were sent in to recover left behind tissue samples of Godzilla for a covert genetice engineering project.
The American soldiers get killed in an ambush by an Arab gunman who is in the employ of an arab nation that has hired Dr. Shiragami and his daughter to create genetically engineered plants to make the desert bloom.
The lab gets blown up, killing Dr. Shiragami's daughter, whose soul is captured by a genetically engineered rose branch.
Dr. Shiragami retreats for five years and is called upon two psychics who learn that his daughter's soul is trapped in the rose bush now called Biollante.
Guess who's coming back to Japan to level it again in the meantime.  Yep, you guessed it...Godzilla.
What follows is a mishmash of a mess with convoulted plot lines and the sudden introduction of a brooding Colonel who can't seem to make a descision without sulking.
Sadly, I can't recommended ""Godzilla vs Biollante.""  Even Jeff thought it was an odd entry into the Godzilla Series.
Not Recommended!

I was half right. The monsters do look really good, and the hd upgrade makes it look great on the big screen. The fight scenes however sucked. Overall I'd say this is an ok (at best) Godzilla movie. Shame, b/c Biollante is an amazing looking kaiju.",1419984000,5,414,4.32051282051282

6508372,5,B00LVZK1LG,Very pleased with visual quality. And best of all. I can watch it in the original Japanese. Dubbing can make any movie sound cheap and unapproachable.,1414886400,3,150,4.8076923076923075
6508373,5,B00LVZK1LG,This Godzilla movie was the first to be made by an all new Toho crew. It has a fresh new feel to it and Godzilla is just beautiful and treated like the 1st wonder of the world. At the time the SPFX were Tohos best. My only gripe is that the final battle is too short and they don't get down like they used to in the old movies. They just shoot rays at eachother a lot. (The Hiesei series is infamous for this)I was waiting for Godzilla to grab a hold of that thing and throw it or for Biolantee to do some really good fight moves but instead we get a brief battle of rays. Still It is a fun movie and I still watch it over and over regardess to its faults. This one is actually my second favorite G movie next to 1964's Godzilla vs. Mothra a.k.a. Godzilla vs. The Thing. Get this DVD because its rare that they put them out.,1414713600,6,824,3.9698795180722892
