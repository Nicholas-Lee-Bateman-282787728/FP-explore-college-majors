Anyway, the story continues it's funny romp  through the sorcerer hunting world, with the charecters getting themselves  into some weird situations.  Plenty of jokes, action, and even a little bit  of emotion can all be found on this tape.  We even finally find out  something about that dark sorcerer guy who made random appearences during  volume 1.  Anyway, it was an enjoyenble installment.  My only complaint is  that it only had two episodes!",967248000,,553,4.891304347826087
8077586,4,6305293910,"Sorcerer Hunters vol 3 is a rather interesting surprise. Unlike the other two volume that seem to be filled with episodes that just don't connect into a greater scheam vol 3 is a pleasent surprise. This volume while still  possessing the comedy that we all loved in the other two volumes also  presents a mystery as well that seems to point to a greater story line. In  this volume the sorcerer hunters are assigned to investigate a village  caught in the grasp of a an insane sorcerer. Yet with four of the hunters  tranformed into little children it is up to Carrot to put an end to the  maddness. But what will the cost of victory be? This volume has adverage  animation, same as the other two volumes. The voice cast is great and so is  the music, especially the opening and ending theme songs. The developing  story is truly a plus along with some great comical moments in episode 7. I  will say that it is important to view the first volume befor seeing this  one or else no sense will come out of this volume, although you can  completly skip the second volume. This is a good series for anyone whom  likes sword and sorcery or fantasy. Warning this film contains violence,  language, and mature themes. Suggest viewing age is 13 and up.",961286400,4,1244,4.471111111111111
