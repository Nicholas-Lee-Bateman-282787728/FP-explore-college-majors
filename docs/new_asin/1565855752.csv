186627,4,1565855752,"This is a series of 48 30-minute lectures on history starting from Sumer and ending with the start of the colonial period, thus it provides a brief survey of a very long time period without covering any aspect in detail.  It provides a summary of when various civilizations rose and fell, and gives the viewer some perspective of events, i.e., when they occurred and how they were interconnected.  I had a little trouble with the sound quality as the narrator's voice seemed to fade at points, and I could not seem to boost the sound level.  I was using the DVD player on my office computer, so perhaps a different DVD player would give better sound.  Overall, it is an easy way to get an overview of a long period of history.
Part 1 starts with Sumer, goes quickly through Egypt and other empires, and ends in Greece.
Part 2 starts with Greece and continues on through Rome.
Part 3 starts at the end of the Roman period, goes through the barbarians and the emergence of the Christian and Muslim religions and ends with Medieval times.
Part 4 starts with Medieval times and goes up to the age of exploration.

Each part is two DVDs with six lectures on each DVD.  There seems to be a memory function bookmarking where you are.  If you stop a DVD at some point, it starts again at that point when you put the DVD back in the player, at least that is the case with my DVD player.",1298073600,7,1377,4.376470588235295

I am sure I got an A in the course because Professor Noble from Duke is so knowledgable there is nothing he did not cover in lecture.  I was so well prepared for online discussions, papers, and the exams.  Thank you Professor Noble and Great Courses, your a gift to working moms who are taking online classes!",1501632000,,417,4.52

7796546,5,1565855752,I like his style and he is one of my top three lecturers. I've bought 15 of these programs now. (The best lecturer is Jonathan Steinberg who is fabulous on his 1715 to 1914 series. It's a bit rare to find.),1437004800,7,206,4.048780487804878
7796547,5,1565855752,"I have visited the ruins of Pompeii and read a lot about it, but I learned some things I didn't know from this course. The professor takes you through the entire history, from the earlier settlements by the Greeks and Etruscans through the volcanic eruption that destroyed the city. This is history the way it should be presented -- fascinating without hyperbole. The course held my interest all the way through, with good visuals, including photos and graphic recreations of what the city would have looked like from its earliest days until its destruction.",1423785600,6,558,4.946808510638298

Really disappointed that there was no course guide book. I will not knowingly purchase a course without the guide book.",1411776000,3,265,4.911111111111111
