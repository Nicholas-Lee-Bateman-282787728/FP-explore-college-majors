4484640,5,B004VW4V8U,"""Mad Mad Mad Monsters"" was the animated spin-off movie from the cult classic Ani-magic movie ""Mad Monster Party."" It originally aired as part of the ""ABC Saturday Superstar Movie series in 1972."" It's animated in a style similar to ""Frosty the Snowman"" and not the Ani-magic style of the Mad Monster Party or Rudolph. None the less it's a great little animated movie, featuring classic movie monsters and that familiar Rankin Bass charm. It's just under 50 mins in length.

Not only do you get the never before released ""Mad Mad Mad Monsters"" movie special on dvd but the ""Jack'O'Lantern"" episode from the series Rankin Bass Presents, ""Family Festival of Classics."" It's just under 25 mins in length and also is a hand drawn animated story. This would made a terrific dvd for Halloween viewing or really any time of the year. I have seen both of these shows and I highly recommend them, for the price also it's a great value! If you're a Rankin Bass fan and enjoy their animated shows this is a must have!",1308960000,23,1005,4.646067415730337

4484645,5,B004VW4V8U,"First off, I'd like to clarify something about this film.  Despite what some reviewers have identified as, 'Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters' is NOT a prequel, nor spin-off, of the AniMagic film, 'Mad Monster Party.'  Instead this is more of an animated, non-canon film utilizing some of the characters from it. This was due to the fact while ABC wanted Rankin/Bass to release 'Mad Monster Party,' for their Saturday Superstar Movie, censors and licensing difficulties didn't make this possible.

Nevertheless, 'Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters' is definitely one of Rankin/Bass' overlooked classics from their vault.  The film almost vanished from obscurity if had not been for a brief VHS release in 1986 by Family Home Entertainment.  Although debuting on ABC's Saturday Superstar Movie in 1972, this animated production only aired twice.

A rare occurrence since ABC did air two other Rankin/Bass TV films, 'The Red Baron' and 'That Girl in Wonderland,' more often on the Saturday Superstar Movie.

This time round, consequently, Dr. Frankenstein forgoes discovering the means for destroying matter, and instead creates a Monstress for his Creature (much to Igor's chagrin).  Impressed with the success of his latest creation, Frankenstein decides on holding a wedding for his creatures.  So he wastes no time sending out invitations to the classic Universal Monsters (to the disdain of a nerve-wracked mail carrier). And also reserves rooms at the Transylvania Astoria, where the ceremony will be held on Friday the 13th.

In this interpretation, there are some new characters.  For instance, the Invisible Man is now married to his 'unseen' wife, Nagatha (aptly named), and they have an invisible son and dog.  Dracula also has a son, but we don't actually see Ms. Dracula.

As for the inconsistencies and the lacking the punch of its AniMagic counterpart, you must bear in mind this film was produced in 1972, and made to fit the ABC Saturday Superstar Movie format.  This is where they'd usually show either a beginning scene, or 'preview' scene before the intros then play the full-film.  In Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters, I notice where Rankin/Bass shows what might have been a 'preview' scene for the film, but they might have forgotten about it during production.

Also due to strict censorship back then, many problems posed here are actually resolved with non-violent methods.  But the interesting there is, it's not as bad as some where they usually 'discuss' their problems.

Included with this is the 'Jack O' Lantern' tale from the ""Rankin/Bass Presents"" specials they used to air back in 1972.  Not a bad tale, and is perfect for Halloween.

Basically if you want something fun for the kids without the gore and violence, I'd recommend this Rankin/Bass Classic for a Halloween treat.  Though it doesn't imply in any fashion of being a Halloween Special, it does serve as a fun one along the lines of other Halloween Animated films.  I applaud Classic Media for releasing this lost treasure.",1377993600,6,2982,5.092592592592593
4484646,5,B004VW4V8U,i love the cartoons and it has all of the actors from the past that has died our is too old it great to hear them again and it is a great cartoon,1376438400,2,145,3.4242424242424243
4484647,5,B004VW4V8U,"This is another movie I watched long ago. It stopped being shown for some reason and I tried to find it for years.

4484648,3,B004VW4V8U,"This cartoon feature wil only be appreciated by fans of 1970s Saturday morning tv and fans of the rankin-Bass film, Mad Monster Party?  I loved the madcap speed of the film and the funny antics of the main characters.",1320192000,2,217,4.564102564102564
4484649,5,B004VW4V8U,"and really no RANKIN/BASS extras to speak of.  It does contain FESTIVAL OF FAMILY CLASSICS:  JACK O' LANTERN.  I have many promotional photos and model sheets, etc.  Would have loved to hear from CLASSIC MEDIA/GENIUS, etc.",1318032000,2,222,5.083333333333333
4484650,3,B004VW4V8U,"As a huge fan of Halloween, monsters and cartoons, I expected to absolutely love this rarely-seen 1972 Rankin/Bass special.  The t.v. special had fallen into relative obscurity over the years, even though it was a sequel of sorts to the earlier stop-motion cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Monster-Party/dp/B002ECJZG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Monster Party</a>.  Indeed, this DVD debut was the first time I'd ever seen it.  Unfortunately, ""Mad Mad Mad Monsters"" uses hand-drawn animation rather than RB's wonderful stop-motion magic, and that's only the start of the problems.

The main thing (and again, I WANTED so much to love it) is that the special just isn't very engaging or funny.  The marginal plot has Baron Von Frankenstein (voiced by a fairly good Karloff imitator, since the legendary star had passed on by this time) creating a bride for his monster, then planning a wedding packed with some wonderfully ghoulish guests.  Getting all the classic monsters together worked fine in Mad Monster Party, but just falls flat here.  The original feature was helped along by some inspired, wacky musical numbers.  Sadly, these don't exist in the follow-up.  The humour, such as it is, falls a few steps below the ""Laugh-In""-style gags of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groovie-Goolies-Saturday-Mourning-Collection/dp/B000ILYYD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groovie Goolies: Saturday Mourning Collection</a>&nbsp;(sample joke: Upon seeing his two creatures meet, Frankenstein declares, ""It's like you were MADE for each other. . .wait a minute, you WERE made for each other!"").

Fairing slightly better is the bonus feature, an episode of Rankin/Bass's ""Festival of Family Classics"" entitled ""Jack O'Lantern"" (also from 1972).  The half-hour shows were retellings of popular folk heroes and children's stories.  Like the main feature, it features hand-drawn animation akin to ""Frosty the Snowman.""

I've given the disc 3 stars because I feel it is imporant to have rare, almost-forgotten animated shows released, and because the prints used by Classic Media are really quite good.  There are no additional features, including addtional subtitles or language tracks.  If you have kids (even grown-up ones) who are monster fans, this might even find a place among their annual Halloween viewing.  And for the money, you could really do a lot worse.",1310688000,9,2457,5.957264957264957

8444113,2,B004VW4V8U,My kids like it but I thought it was terrible.  I was hoping it was going to be fun because it's monsters and Rankin Bass.

8444114,5,B004VW4V8U,"""MAD,MAD,MAD MONSTERS"" was of course,Rankin/Bass' 1972 animated film,originally aired on ABC-TV's ""THE SATURDAY SUPERSTAR MOVIE""
was another testiment of Arthur Rankin,Jr and Jules Bass (may he seriously rest in peace!) and their animated TV and Film history. the animated movie
was well made,spoofing the Horror genre,much like Filmation Associates' ""THE GROOVY GOOLIES"",but more focused on the classic aspects of the genre,using Boris Karloff's voice and likeness,which helped! much of Rankin/Bass' cel animated cartoons at the time,were animated in both Japan,at Toei and Mushi Studios,while Halas-Batchelor animated ""THE JACKSON FIVE"" and ""THE OSMONDS"" in Great Britain,,but this ABC Saturday morning movie
was still superior,and greatly remembered! at the time in Fall 1972,Rankin/Bass had also produced ""KID POWER"" for ABC,and did two more SATURDAY SUPERSTAR MOVIES, like""WILLIE MAYS AND THE SAY HEY KID"",another cel animated classic,as well as ""THE RED BARRON"",,and an
animated spoof,based on the popular ABC series ""THAT GIRL""(1966-1971) starring,and using the voice of series' star, Marlo Thomas.  all the same,
Rankin/Bass certainly established it's Saturday morning roots,while continuing to produce their Emmy winning stop motion TV specials for the networks,and like other studios,was active in creating more impressive animated shows and specials. but ""MAD,MAD,MAD MONSTERS"" was a true 70's animated classic,also based on the Rankin/Bass stop motion movie,""MAD MONSTER PARTY"",that was released by Embassy Pictures in 1967,and stayed very true to the classic Horror genre,but with a great sense of humor,and good writing! i recommend this Classic Media DVD to only serious viewers,who'll appreciate and enjoy this Saturday morning movie,from back in the days,when cel animated cartoons ruled the weekends!",1448236800,,1818,5.9655172413793105
