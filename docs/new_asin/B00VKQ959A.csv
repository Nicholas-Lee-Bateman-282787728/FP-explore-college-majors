7093120,4,B00VKQ959A,"Enjoyed this DVD, but with a few exceptions.  My biggest complaint is I wish this DVD workout was longer.  As with most of Ellen's newer releases, this DVD is just shy of 30 minutes.  The DVD is entitled Peace, Love and CARDIO.  While it was a gentle, peaceful workout, I just really felt the cardio was lacking and the title misleading.  Had the workout been 45 minutes or more, I think this would have been excellent, but with this release I don't feel like it was long enough to get me to that cardiovascular threshhold that does the trick for me.  The first half of the workout is slow marching/walking in place, with soft jumps out into sumo squats, plies  followed by gentle side leg raises (kicks) and a chair (squat series) with side twists (very good series for the lower body).  The final sequence was the most enjoyable for me, using a combo consisting of lunges, to plank, downard dog and back to a lunge followed by standing.  It was very refreshing and I LOVED THAT part but it was short lived.  Just when I was starting to get into the groove, the DVD was done.  I really LOVE Ellen's older 45 minute workout releases and I feel a wee-bit cheated with these newer, easier 30 minute routines, especially with the term ""cardio"" in the title.  I wish she would release a DVD that had 3-4 shorter routines (20-30 minutes) on it, so you could mix or match, or have the option of making your workouts longer or more difficult based on your preferences. This DVD had all the moves to make it great, and different from her other workouts,  just not the duration to get the advertised ""cardio"".  I am a intermediate to advanced exerciser.  This DVD really is great for anyone, but would be best suited for beginners, rest days, people recovering from injuries, or needing lower impact, or to add onto other routines.  That being said, I did end up adding another workout by Jessica Smith on the end of this one to feel like my routine was more well rounded and complete.  I plan to keep this DVD, and use it periodically, but unfortunately, it will not be part of my standard routine of workouts.",1428969600,23,2102,4.489473684210527
7093121,4,B00VKQ959A,A great session for beginners and advanced participants. Besides providing the physical benefits of exercise this DVD is also a wonderful stress reliever.,1485561600,,154,5.739130434782608

7093125,5,B00VKQ959A,"I love Ellen Barrett, and I am a big fan of her workouts. This one in particular I really enjoy because it's both soothing and relaxing, yet by the end of the workout you're sweating bullets. This one and her Super Slim Down Pilate's blend are my favorite. She leaves you feeling both energized and feelin' good!",1465948800,3,312,4.491228070175438
7093126,5,B00VKQ959A,"Love Ellen Barretts DVDs, low impact but workouts still work your muscles and get some cardio as well, and also relax your mind and give you a sense of peace.  Highly recommend.",1461715200,,177,4.53125
7093127,2,B00VKQ959A,I love Ellen Barrett's other videos. This one is not much of a challenge compared to Sleek and Sculpt and Super Fast Body Blast. Those two are much more of a workout. I will continue to watch for others of hers though.,1460160000,3,218,4.214285714285714
7093128,5,B00VKQ959A,"Ellen tells you to think of exercise as a treat, and this workout is just that.. Not strenuous, so if you're looking for something to really make you sweat, this isn't the one for you. I run three times a week and alternate with strength/yoga/stretch workouts. I use this on stretch days, and boy, does it feel good! I have so much energy after I am done. It's a great way to be kind and loving to your body. Would totally recommend for beginners or for those looking for something to do in between more strenuous workouts. And on those days I don't feel like exercising at all, I can always talk myself into this one!",1459123200,5,618,4.336206896551724

7093131,5,B00VKQ959A,"I like how she integrates cardio, stretching and yoga.  30 minutes is perfect for short days and a great warm up or cool down for longer work out days.  She is not annoying - explains what you need to know and provides good instruction.  It is challenging but not strenuous.",1455062400,3,274,4.44
7093132,5,B00VKQ959A,"Although it doesn't feel like I'm working very hard, the workout is fun and is perhaps deceptively challenging. Ellen and her fellow instructors are great. I especially love seeing Michelle in the DVDs. I will do this workout all winter and not get tired of it.",1452470400,,261,4.695652173913044
7093133,5,B00VKQ959A,"All of Ellen's workouts are great, i'm a big fan of her. I love how her workouts first seem easy, sometimes too easy but you soon realize you are working out pretty hard but not too hard. That's what I love about her dvds your not left exhausted at the end just energized, which I love.  This probably would be cardio light for some hardcore cardio people but I really recommend it.",1451520000,,382,4.305555555555555

7093143,4,B00VKQ959A,"I enjoy Ellen's workouts and I own most of them.  This one is good but if you are expecting it to be ""cardio"" you might be disappointed.  It might be good for a lighter or rest day, but it's just not challenging enough to make it into my rotation.",1435276800,4,247,4.020408163265306

7093145,1,B00VKQ959A,"I have 6 Ellen DVDs in my exercise rotation, but this one won't be joining them.  No cardio effect at all, unimaginative moves, dull music, and too much chatter from a leader I normally love.  Ellen can do so much better.",1433721600,7,221,4.365853658536586

7093148,5,B00VKQ959A,"This workout is simply a treat for your body. It feels fantastic the whole way through, and as an extra added bonus it got my heart rate slightly elevated and I worked up a light sweat. I felt stretched and energized afterward, and thoroughly enjoyed the 30 minute session, which flew by way too fast (not something I usually say about exercise routines). I'm using this to supplement my tougher workouts with something gentle that feels good for my body.

This may not be a workout that burns a zillion calories and leaves you exhausted and gasping for breath, but in my opinion, it's way better than that. It makes you feel good about moving your body, and as always, Ellen and her workout companions are wonderful company. (And they all look fabulous too, proving that Ellen's philosophy of honoring your body and doing exercises that make you feel good, also have the added benefit of making you look good, too!)",1431648000,11,916,4.6894409937888195
7093149,5,B00VKQ959A,"I confess that I'm an Ellen Barrett fan from way back (when she had a short curly bob!). I've always found her persona so charming, uplifting, and thoughtful: she likes to share her take on life and fitness, in just the right amounts at the right times. This video was ordered from her website. I did the workout today and I really enjoyed it. The music is possibly her best on any video yet (though I tend to like most of it, even the slightly oddball soundtracks). The moves had a smoothness and flow to them that I found very energizing rather than disrupting or jolting. The whole thing felt like a kind of yoga dance, or a muscular-skeletal massage. It's the kind of workout (wish we could find a nicer word for it) that I'd like to do in the morning when I'm still wanting gentleness and low lighting, and want to ease into the day. It's a workout also for when you are tired after a day's work, or any time when you want to get the blood and oxygen moving in a pleasant, unstressful way. The moves are interesting enough to be stimulating, but not too much to be a trying choreography. Most exercisers should be able to get a handle on it pretty well the first time through.

I'd also like to mention that Meg and Michelle, those veteran co-exercisers, are also along for the ride on this one -- and very charming they are, too. They execute the moves perfectly and, as another reviewer commented, they have never looked better. Working out with such a trio of lovely ladies just adds to the enjoyment of this well-performed, well-filmed ath-dance (my new name for 'workout').",1430092800,12,1583,4.477508650519031

As the dvd went on there are some great movements & some hard ones to for me (67) but there is the low impact person to follow. I was not impressed with the camera work. In some areas the camera was in upper mode while being a first time user with this I would of liked to see full body so I can move along with it. It did get my heartbeat up which is great. I think I would use this more for a warmup before I would do my aerobics or dance/walk. There are planks to do in this dvd but you don't have to do them. This dvd is about 30 minutes long. I do love Ellens other dvds which I have purchased. To each their own on this dvd.,1486684800,,700,3.6733333333333333
