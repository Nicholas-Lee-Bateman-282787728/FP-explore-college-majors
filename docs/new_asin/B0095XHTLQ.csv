8536306,4,B0095XHTLQ,"A remarkable Biblical story of The Creation and the first family on Earth.  Of course, a lot of details are added that are not in the Bible, but the story is very interesting and gives one much food for thought.  I am a big fan of these Sight and Sound productions!",1412208000,,265,4.176470588235294
8536307,5,B0095XHTLQ,"I have been to Sight and Sound theatre to see a few of their shows, enjoyed every one of them, the show is a little pricey. Found these DVD's on Ebay and Amazon for few dollars less than you pay at the theatre. Good communication, fast shipping. Thank you",1393632000,2,255,4.224489795918367

8536311,5,B0095XHTLQ,"I have had the pleasure to travel to Lancaster, PA several times to the Sight & Sound Theater and have never been disappointed. When I saw Jonah earlier this month at intermission I went into the gift shop and purchased a DVD of the play Ruth. It was amazing but the cost was a little much. While on Amazon looking for something else I saw the DVD of THE BEGINNING. The prize was half of the gift shop. The movie is wonderful and more than once left me wondering ""how did they do that?"". The fact that this is live theater is even more amazing.
I will buy other movies from this theater. They are top notch and absolutely mesmerizing.",1357344000,3,634,4.291666666666667
8536312,3,B0095XHTLQ,"Delivery and everything was great and on time.  The movie was okay, but the production wasn't all that it could have been.  The grace and sacredness of the creation of the earth and the way God interacts with Adam and Eve was not really portrayed here.  It was more kiddish and peppy. An example: Adam is portrayed as overly hyper at times, instead of noble and holy as Father of mankind.  It seems more of a production intended for older children (maybe 8-14?).  Still, much of the set is elaborate and some of the acting is good.  However, not an adult-level threatre production.",1357257600,3,581,4.592233009708738
