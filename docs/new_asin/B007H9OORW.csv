Why? Well, let's start with the absolutely gorgeous two sided artwork on the metal (!) cover, which already makes it stick out on the shelf. Inside you have two absolutely gorgeous transfers of the films. You also get a lot of extras- commentaries for both, featurettes, and more. The Synapse release just has the film, so if you want a lot more, this is the way to go.

The other reason is just that Arrow Films does it right. They are fans of these films I suspect as well, and it shows- through the living care the transfers get, through the more than generous extras offered, down to the artwork that accompanies the discs, always top notch!

Extremely recommended if you love the films!",1426723200,,854,4.325
