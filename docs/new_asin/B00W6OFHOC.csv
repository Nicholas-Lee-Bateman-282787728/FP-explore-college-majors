7125539,2,B00W6OFHOC,"This firm achieves a kind of iconic status for paving the way for work like Thirty-something, in which the worst elements of the baby boomers are thrust on full display in all their myopia and cruelty. That is perhaps taking it a bit far. But the film, like a worse, more commercial and uneven version of John Sayles's ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven,"" is content to make cartoons of the archetypal about-face members of the 60s counter-culture did as they giddily went into business and bad journalism. They whine and lament and fervor they lacked. I was a child when I saw this. I have watched it more than once as an adult. As a child their sell-out seems winsome and fun. Admittedly everyone must make a living, and the success of the characters is no sin - they way they see themselves, however, as these benighted figures of 60s enlightenment who compromised reeks of a narcissism that could potentially represent me misreading the film. Perhaps it is brilliant and we are supposed to feel contempt for these enlightened rich children who care nothing about class or race or any of the injustices that seemed so vogue in late night dorm room conversations. The characters lack all conviction. The music, a soundtrack driven by artists, matters, in some way, more than their petty laments about not living up to what they had never lived up to. It is either a near-perfect indictment of dishonesty (I doubt it; like Alex Keaton on ""Family Ties"" it enjoys itself so much) or a corrupt piece of nostalgic schlock for a period mired in fakery - at least for these pretenders with their sneaker companies and art pretensions.",1436572800,4,1628,4.71578947368421
7125540,3,B00W6OFHOC,"I love this movie but this version is so lame because there are no subtitles.  I find the sound track to be uneven and there are a lot of nuances to the conversations between these characters which would be much more meaningful if they could be completely understood, with subtitles.",1436486400,5,283,4.66

7125546,5,B00W6OFHOC,One of my favorite movies of all times.  See it once a year just to hear the music and see the actor/actresses in their premier roles of times gone by.  Thanks for having it available even now.,1462492800,2,193,4.1891891891891895

7125550,5,B00W6OFHOC,This is a great older movie about a group of college students who reunite and spend the week together after one of their friends commits suicide.  The music is great.  There is a great scene where they are just sitting around in the kitchen loading the dishwasher and dancing.  Great cast.  There is also a music CD.,1457740800,3,316,4.491228070175438

7125552,3,B00W6OFHOC,"Great flick
It was sold as a blue ray disc. The resolution of the images was clearly not high definition.  You can't record a low resolution video on a blue ray disc and turn it into a high Def video. It is misleading to market this as a blue ray product.",1456790400,6,255,4.0

7125568,2,B00W6OFHOC,"This a very poor job by Criterium transferring this film to Blu-ray.  I've enjoyed several other of their titles with great transfers to Blu-ray, this is unfortunately not one of them.",1451692800,7,184,4.935483870967742
7125569,5,B00W6OFHOC,"I first saw this when I was 17. It was amazing. I had to replace my 15th anniversary DVD for this newest release. I first watched this a month and a couple weeks after I met Kevin Kline. (June 2012). I bet the cast went to see this at the TIFF in September 2013 and thought ""Look how young all of us used to be."" The bunnies version is funny. Lawrence (Kasdan) is one of my absolute favorite movie directors. And now I've seen all of the 6 films he and Kevin collaborated in from this all the way to Darling Companion. I even have some in French, Italian and German.",1451174400,,566,4.108108108108108

8712351,5,B00W6OFHOC,"One of my favorite movies of absolutely all time!!! I have the DVD. Had a VHS copy. But now I think I'll grab a Blu-ray copy before they disappear. I would also recommend, if you haven't seen this film, check into the background of how it was filmed. Also, fun fact, Kevin Costner was cast as Alex, the friend who's funeral they have gotten together to attend. As they try to figure out why their friend took his own life, they also find out just how much their friendship means to them. Back to Kevin Costner. His role, presumably in flashbacks, was cut from the film. Lawrence Kasdan made it up to him when he cast him as Jake in Silverado, another fantastic Lawrence Kasdan project. Also make note of Kasdan's two sons and his wife, who show up in his movies in small parts. But this WAS the early 80s, so we are all grown-ups now. Sort of. So if you're going to watch The Big Chill, make sure you allot plenty of  quality time to NOT miss a single scene or a single WORD. Then watch it again.",1530576000,,996,4.242105263157895

8712357,4,B00W6OFHOC,"The Bing Chill puts perhaps the greatest cast together of its time to portray college friends getting reunited following the suicide of another friend. Well-acted, but lacking a strong and compelling script, the movie has its flaws. However, the casts chemistry carries it far enough.",1513036800,,284,5.333333333333333
