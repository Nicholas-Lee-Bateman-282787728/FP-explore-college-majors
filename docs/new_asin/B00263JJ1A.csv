8351751,4,B00263JJ1A,"A stunning visual tour of various crop circle sights, and very interesting interviews with the people connected to them. The things these people have to say...it's just so amazing! Crop circles are clearly a form of communication. I believe that people are so drawn to them because they feel the need to communicate with those that created them. I feel like this DVD brought me closer to knowing who or what they may be, & just seeing the people that have experienced them makes me feel more connected than before",1374883200,,513,4.711111111111111
8351752,5,B00263JJ1A,"I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to spend the night in field waiting to see what or who creates a crop circle. Scary stuff. After watching this I truly believe that these are forces way bigger than us. Nature is beyond powerful. Try to go up against the ocean some time and you'll see what I mean.",1374883200,,295,4.192982456140351
8351753,2,B00263JJ1A,Information in the film was repetitive and boring. I don't recommend it at all. (My review apparently requires twelve words or more and that's very irritating.),1367798400,,160,5.1923076923076925
8351754,4,B00263JJ1A,I haven't completely made up my mind about crop circles. After watching this video I could still see it going either way but having said that there is a lot of compelling evidence here.,1359504000,,185,4.470588235294118
8351755,5,B00263JJ1A,"I loved this movie, I love anything that has to do with crop circles....they are so phenomenal!  I would definitely suggest this to anyone interested in crop circles.",1348358400,,166,4.928571428571429
8351756,4,B00263JJ1A,"The more I find out about crop circles the more amazed I am.  Even if they're a complete hoax by bands of pranksters, that in itself is an amazing feat.  And the beauty of them seen from the air is astonishing.  And the fact they keep getting bigger and more complex is also amazing.  What's particularly striking in this DVD is the aerial photography juxtaposed with the on-the-ground footage.  Just by looking at it, you can see how impossible--both from an engineering standpoint and an organizational standpoint--it would be to do this so perfectly with explainable tools.  But is the Earth itself communicating with us?  That seems even more impossible.  People have come forward, saying they created these, but they never have evidence, and in this day of cell-phones and digital video cameras, this seems impossible.  A lot to ponder in this DVD.",1276214400,3,853,4.909090909090909
8351757,3,B00263JJ1A,"Really compelling stuff for anyone who has an interest in the subject. Examination of  strange events of 7/7/07 in Wilshire, England, with camera surveillance and eye witness accounts to document the amazing emergence of enormous crop circles. Also discussion of the evolution of their patterns and meaning since 1978.",1252368000,3,318,5.489795918367347
8351758,5,B00263JJ1A,"Ever since I saw Signs, I have been interested in crop circles.  I used to just write them off as clear pranks or silliness but I am not so sure anymore.  The complexities of some of the designs and stories people told of circles that clearly were created in less time than humanly possible leave me baffled.  Who is doing this and why???  It is difficult to refute that something strange is happening.  Very informative while entertaining.  I highly recommend this movie.",1250121600,5,472,4.695121951219512
