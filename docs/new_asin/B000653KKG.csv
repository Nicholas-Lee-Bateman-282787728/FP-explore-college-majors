8038667,3,B000653KKG,"My husband, a farmer, really liked this DVD. He just settled into his recliner and enjoyed these old movie reels of farming, equipment (tractors! oh boy!) and implements, fields, clothing, rural scenes. Just a simple, cozy way to spend an evening.
Worthy purchase for those interesting in post-WWII farming.",1344211200,,307,5.285714285714286
8038668,5,B000653KKG,The highlight of this DVD set is the footage on teh building and maintainence of the panama canal. It's shot beautifully and gave me an understanding of the canal's place in history that I had never had before.  Because you get to see all stages of construction you get a sense of just what a monumental task the canal was. Teh footage has also been kept in excellent shape. Five Stars!,1153353600,,386,4.436619718309859
8038669,5,B000653KKG,"Did you ever look at your dinner or lunch and wonder exactly where the food on your plate came from? I have, and the response is not ""the store!"" These movies, shot in the 1950s, explain exactly how food starts off on  farms around the world and is harvested and pakcaged and put in your local market. It's interesting. I liked the spot about how coca cola helped people in the far east get jobs. The movies seem like advertisements sometimes but are well directed and filled with enough solid information that that did not bother me at all.",1148428800,,541,4.4646464646464645
