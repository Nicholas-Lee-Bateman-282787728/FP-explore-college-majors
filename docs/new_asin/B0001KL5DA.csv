2009335,5,B0001KL5DA,"the first season is a perfect introduction to the fisher family.  in the second season everyone is explored more thoroughly and true colors really begin to show.  this is particularly evident in the relationship between nate and brenda.  what happens here is totally unbelievable and you find yourself after each episode what the hell are these two doing together.  when you watch the series also bookmark the episode where nate travels to seattle and visits and old friend because it has serious implications in the third series.  the relationship between david and keith grows and demolishes in this season but it makes for good dramedy.  claire just gets cooler with every season, and i love her to death because she is so strong but she is also so vulnerable at the same time.  she really becomes more of an adult in this season and we see her start to deal with the adult world and real life and i realize that her ascent into adulthood is very close to actual reality.  ruth maintains her stealy outside through most of the season but you see her start to break out a little and try knew things.  she begins to date even more this season and it just makes her so interesting.  there are so many twists and turn in the second season that it just keeps you wanting more.  the fight between nate and brenda is awesome and has been building the whole season.  and then there is the cliffhanger ending episode that just makes you want the third season to come right after you finish watching the second season.  you really want to know what happens to nate and the first episode of the third season will really throw everyone for a loop....i swear.",1064275200,15,1649,4.568027210884353
2009336,5,B0001KL5DA,"Six Feet Under is the best show on television. It is deep, smart, and sexy.  It deals with controversial issues but is still hilarious.  It is likely that the people that don't like the series are either too dumb or too much of a prude to understand and enjoy it.  I watched the complete first season in one sitting-very addicting! I intentionally did not watch the last series on HBO, so I could watch in order-now don't tell me it may not be released!  What a bummer.",1063670400,,469,4.35632183908046
2009337,5,B0001KL5DA,"Six Feet Under is a unique and interesting look at death.  Six Feet Under is better than a great majority of the shows on tv. Some say it's like a soap opera with it's progressive storyline and love interests.  But I say it's creating a new standard of tv.
The first season was highly addictive for me. I give high kudos to the opening credits...amazing music and opening scenes. The cast is extremely talented and give captavating performance.  I am waiting every so patiently for the second season on be released on dvd.
Provocative...enthralling...like I said...highly addictive.
For those of you who have never seen Six Feet Under I would like to recommend if possible to watch from the episode one and go from there.  The effect will be more massive. :)",1062547200,31,758,4.71969696969697

2009461,4,B0001KL5DA,"On a side note - , its so interesting to go back and watch a show that took place right before the dawn of the smart phone and social media. Seems quant at times. Claire, who's in high school at this point in the show, emails and uses the old AOL IM to communicate with Billy.  Ahhh, brings back memories. Also in the backdrop are mentions of the Enron scandal and the Bush presidency.

So, I will say the show holds up well overall. Some of the dialogue and situations seem a bit contrived and just a little cringe worthy. I actually found myself getting annoyed with the writing at times. At other times, it was right on the money. As always, the acting is outstanding and the show's concept is brilliant. One would have to credit shows such as 6 Feet Under, along with the Sopranos, for contributing to the sea change in television programming; despite some short comings, this show was revolutionary at the time. It dealt with death and relationships and life in a way that very few shows have been able to do. Gotta give credit to Alan Ball (American Beauty) for creating a truly memorable show.",1483228800,,1100,4.467661691542289

It is the second time I've watched this program (I saw it when it was still on) and I am enjoying it just as much the second time. The themes than run throughout the series are death, sex, relationships, and family. It can be hilarious, it can be heartbreaking, it can be meaningful in how it can relate to our real lives. It really is the perfect blend of drama and comedy. Dramedy, I guess they call it.  Characters are great, very realistic (but in an interesting way). And, strange to say, but my favorite part of the show is how in the beginning of most episodes we see the death of the next person who's family goes to the Fisher and Sons (or Fisher and Diaz) funeral home. Sometimes it is what we expect death to be, sad, but it can also be funny-sad. And it can often remind one of how unexpectedly death could hit. Anyone, anywhere, anyhow in just a blink of an eye. And that should remind us to appreciate life.",1474934400,,978,4.258064516129032

As we progressed into Season 2, things began to fall apart to the point where it has become a silly soap opera featuring silly people.  Now, almost every episode is crammed with extensive, empty soft-porn scenes with no point to them.  The characters have developed into neurotic, shallow, narcisstic parodies of human beings, except for the young, angsty teenager, Claire, who seems to be the only character with any kind of relateable realism.

It actually humanizes what a funeral director may be confronting with at a time of the lost of a loved one. And the Fishers!! You can't beat them as a group of great characters themselves, although somewhat dysfunctional.

2010099,3,B0001KL5DA,"Why is it that every single TV series this year has to have a main character who who just has to be gay or transvestite? Not only that, but they've just got to show us the man on man humping, sucking, and tonguing. There is more gay sex then straight sex on TV now. You'd start to think there is a political agenda being forced on us from those that make our media!....It's getting really tiresome.

Otherwise, it is a good show. The other characters are great and have enough depth for me to get to know them. Storyline is good and I like following how things are progressing from one episode to the next.

The drug us is a bit unbelievable. I don't know many people who pick up meth and just go about their business the next day like nothing happened, but I guess the writers don't have any experience smoking meth. :P",1463270400,,820,4.283870967741936

Am on the third season.  It seems a bit disorganized right now but am assured by other reviews that things get straightened out.

It does have a lot of odd sequences in each episode, but I love the storyline!  The whole family drama revolving around a funeral home business is great!

Joanna Cassidy is great - she looks as beautiful as she did back in the ""Buffalo Bill"" days (maybe more so).  Ruth is a great character, ankle socks not withstanding, and her bafflement as to where her little children have gone to really rings true to any mother of grown children.

Whose lives can I get involved with for a short time?

Well, the suggestion was absolutely correct.  I have trying to watch 2 episodes per night, however that does not always happen.  I am very intrigued and interested in all of the characters.  I feel involved in their lives.

There is nothing like it.  It has been an education.  At first, I thought it was really funny in a macabre sort of way, and not much more.  As the series progressed, it became much deeper in life and death meanings and emotions.  Tremendous growth in characters.

We have been hooked on this series since episode 1, and are currently (sadly) watching the final few episodes.  Some infuriating character flaws and blindnesses make the occasional scene hard to watch if you empathize at all (makes you feel like a kid at a western wanting to holler ""Look out, Hopalong--he's behind the tree!""), but the characters' resilience and capacity to keep soldiering on are admirable.

2011031,3,B0001KL5DA,"For close to three years, Six Feet Under was a terrific show but then the dark side began to smother all the other elements and particularly in the last two seasons, it was such a depressive downer that when it was over, I searched quickly for a comedy to get the dark negativity out of my head. I honestly wish I hadn't watched those last two years. I also have to say that the acting throughout was first class all the way. I would single out Lauren Ambrose who was a marvel, brilliantly showing us the development of Claire from an adolescent to a very mature young woman. She was the best part of this show. I also need to single out Jeremy Sisto who soars in every scene he is in as a man valiantly struggling to overcome his bi-polar disease. At the end, however, this show left a very bad taste in my mouth. I sometimes think of myself as rather cynical but this was too much even for me.",1438992000,2,895,4.209302325581396

This well paced contemporary drama portrays what feels like real people with real problems and tops it off with the underlying subject matter we all face; life and death.  In that context, there is always a premise explored that will leave you pondering whether you want to or not.  While it handles very serious topics, the writers have not made the mistake of making it so ""poignant"" that you are left depressed by leavening the 'heavy' with the humor of human foible.  All in all, it is very compelling",1434412800,,689,4.622950819672131

2011250,3,B0001KL5DA,"With engaging characters and a witty/insightful script this show is worth watching.  Unfortunately binge-watching it forced me to realize that many of the important social elements of the stories appear dated.  Also, and this may just be a symptom of binge watching, the extreme moral introspection needed to constantly create thought-provoking questions wears the credibility of the characters down.  With the credibility of characters run down enough the plot(s) begin to sound like old daytime soaps.  I stopped caring multiple times ... only to be brought back to the show with a well-written interchange or clever scene.  I would call it dated and meh, but you may like it much better if you don't try to watch the season in a single weekend.",1433721600,,747,5.040650406504065

Now that I have Amazon Prime I've been horizontal in front of the television more than I should be, but can't stop watching this great program.

2011737,5,B0001KL5DA,"This series continues to explore so many cultural issues and taboos, without being preachy. The unpredictability of these stories is one of the series' best charms. One moment the plot line seems to be heading in one direction, the next next it veers off into a delightful left field.

Character development continues. One mother and daughter, alienated from each other for so many years and seemingly radically different in personality and their outlook on life, share the unfortunate trait of desperately seeking love and always choosing the wrong kind of man. Another mother/daughter pair are locked in a love/hate, passive/aggressive relationship. The two brothers are plagued by relationship problems of their own.

Great story lines & character development. It also has a curious attention to the hyper libidinous! It's about 10 years old now & is still fresh.

2012022,5,B0001KL5DA,"Having been a fan of the show when it originally aired on HBO and watching every episode back then, it was just as enjoyable watching when they came out on DVD I watched them all again.  Dark and satirical at times, intellectual and tragic, with times of joy and hope mixed in.  The episodes are about the Fisher and Sons family funeral home.  The stories follow the ongoing lines of the family, spliced in with the individual stories of their client and client families, as well as the funeral chain that wants to buy them and independently run homes/parlors like theirs.  One of the best things to come from HBO!",1412640000,,614,4.554545454545455

Evidently, the writer does not have a good vocabulary.  Perhaps the dictionary could help.

As we should all realize that each and every one of us will die someday, the episodes do bring that fact out that we never know when our number will be called.

It is so unnecessary to continue to use the ""F"" word in any movie!!",1411430400,,398,4.28

2012076,5,B0001KL5DA,"If I could, I would give this series 20 stars.  Recently I purchased the Amazon Fire TV system (it took 3 minutes to get it up and running).  I started to scroll through the Amazon Prime TV series and I found HBO's SIX FEET UNDER.  I started to watch, and I could not stop.  The series ran from 2001-2005.  What an amazing cast!!  Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Lauren Ambrose, Rachel Griffiths, Matthew St. Patrick, and Frances Conroy lead an outstanding ensemble.  I was hooked on it after the first 5 minutes.  I'm still watching.  I would make one recommendation.  I have found that Amazon's version is around 795 minutes;  the actual HBO release is almost 1400 minutes.  The HBO version is about 25 dollars more, but you will get the full series, unedited -- and you will not want to miss a minute of it.  At first, Amazon Fire TV was showing the complete series, but a couple of days ago they switched over to the edited version -- so I purchased the series directly from HBO.  I'll continue to watch it on Amazon Fire -- but my wife and I are going to watch the whole series all over again when the dvd's arrive.  The acting is so good that you actually find yourself getting  caught up with the story.  It's a Drama, but also a Comedy.  Rarely do you find such a !!well written, well acted series.  The casting was just perfect!!!",1410998400,,1338,4.387755102040816

2012116,5,B0001KL5DA,"This review is for the entire series - My third time taking this journey.  The writing and casting, therefore acting are superb.  The pilot alone stands out as one of the most original pieces of material since I don't know what, Harold and Maude and perhaps Topper. This is the darkest of black comedies.  Everyone is angry and sad and screwed up and more-or-less obsessed with sex. The most realistic and believable of dramas. (Oh, I did say comedy, right?) Yeah, well is not a comedy, comedy. It's more like, ""Oh, look how horrible and screwed-up and unresolved these people's lives are. They're almost as bad as mine, only, maybe worse. Ha-ha. That kind of funny. What's not funny about sex, death and misery?  Definately not a show for TV dumb-dumbs.

And one does not have to have a seriously whacked-out, morbid sense of humor to thoroughly enjoy this drama, though it might help! I missed it on the Tube (stationed in Japan during the run) but making up for it now! It really is too bad that television cannot keep and hold this level of quality in programming. Don't miss this - unless you are one of those 17th century holdout bigots/homophobes. In that case this show will either turn you on or disgust you ;-)",1409097600,,521,4.381443298969073

2012160,4,B0001KL5DA,"This is a good show.  It is distinctly strange.  People talk to the dead.  Sometimes you see what the characters are imagining.  At first the characters seem ridiculous, but eventually they become believable.  They talk about interesting things like the meaning and purpose of life, death, art, religion, sanity, love, etc. without being to pretentious or preachy.  It shows lots of dead bodies and many of them are smashed up.  There is plenty of sex, drugs and alcohol. Sometimes it is funny, sometimes it is serious.",1409011200,,519,4.965116279069767

Now I'm able to go back and have marathon viewings of many of my favorites. One of my favorites was Six Feet Under. I was only able to catch certain episodes first time around. The best part of each episode is the first few minutes when someone dies...setting up one of that week's story lines. If you haven't seen it go to Season Two, Episode 8. The beginning may well be one of the greatest scenes in the history of televison.",1408665600,,572,4.256880733944954

I saw many faces I have seen in other great series that came after ""Six Feet Under"", including Anna Gunn, of ""Breaking Bad"", and of course ""Dexter"", playing almost a complete opposite of his serial killer fame.
I was hooked by the first season, and watched the whole series in less than two weeks.

2012188,5,B0001KL5DA,"One of the best series I can remember.  Lauren Ambrose's character as well as Frances Conroy's have really emerged in the second season as complex and layered.  The format of what amounts to a serial story revolving around a death that occurs in the first few minutes of each episode continues to work quite well.  Ironically Peter Krause's character is probably the weakest, due to the way it is written.  He seems to be something of a doormat much of the time and then suddenly, and for no apparent reason, explodes periodically, usually into a cartoon of machismo.  I am hoping some subtlety comes back to his part.  Jeremy Sisto is excellent as Brenda's psychotic and conflicted brother who, much of the time, is losing his fight to regain sanity.",1408320000,,751,4.7384615384615385

2012214,3,B0001KL5DA,"I have mixed feelings about this series. Part of me wants to just quit watching and go on to something else. Sort of like when you're halfway through a book and can't bring yourself to pick it up and read it just for the sake of finishing it. First off, none of the characters are very likeable. They are all so wimpy and whiney. And the overuse of the F bomb, wow, do people really talk like that in everyday life? Not in my world. There are flashbacks, dream sequences, and conversations with dead people which show up at the strangest times. The acting is ok I guess, I am really not a great judge of that. The best part of each show is at the beginning when a person dies, sometimes in a surprising way, other times mundane. Six Feet Under is a prime time soap opera and, like daytime soaps, seems to spin its wheels oftentimes going nowhere.",1407888000,,846,4.29375

Anyone viewing an episode can expect to feel what is being portrayed as something relational in their own lives and this is probably the redeeming force that keeps me watching and enjoying. Some of the episodes, in which it could be attributed to the writers of them, are not as good as most, yet overall a 3 1/2 to 4 rating is where they all average out and I would recommend adults view this series.",1406073600,,576,4.495238095238095

2012364,5,B0001KL5DA,"I love this series. Season Two takes the characters deeper into themselves: life is path-dependent. Brenda's mother gets weirder and weirder. Ruth continues to bumble through finding her truth. Nate faces himself in new and potentially tragic ways. So does David, in his quest for intimacy. (His cop-boyfriend is, btw, gorgeous.) Rachel starts to feel things, and the weirdness of her past is probed and in some respects explained. Claire's still trying out her voice, so someone, anyone, can hear her. Billy's reality continues to be searing and sad. Federico's life gets increasingly complicated. And Big Funeral continues to try to ruin the Fishers and their painstakingly built business. I could go on, but the list of characters is too long for that.
Trigger warnings (some from my review of Season One):
(1) Be prepared to face death: every episode begins with one. You'll get an initial look at the body, too -- nothing more than you'd see on the British crime shows, and here they're shown on the embalming room slab as well as in the casket. There's more violence in Season Two.
(2) Also be prepared to learn some things about the funeral business, and I don't mean just the difference between a casket and a coffin. There's plenty of show and tell (mostly tell) about ""restoration,"" the process of showing even the most damaged corpse at its best, thanks to the magic of the undertaker's special variety of cosmetic materials. And there's plenty of interaction with grieving families of every -- yes, every -- stripe. The consequences of death's knowing no holiday come into play.
(3) There's quite a lot of sex, too, both straight and gay, and sometimes gratuitous, imho.
(4) (Forgot to put this in my review of Season One) One of the minor characters has a serious mental illness, and you see this play out in behavior and family dynamics.
(5) Language.
All that said: Six Feet Under is comedic, thanks to approaches both broad and highly nuanced; beautiful; and occasionally tragic, thanks to, well, the vagaries of life, because this is what the series depicts. All the characters continue to be sympathetic, though not all the time, or at the same time. All continue to struggle, to be true to themselves, to be good people, to honor the deceased. In this respect, I'd place this series on the same level of quality as The Sopranos.",1405814400,,2347,4.840796019900497

2012404,5,B0001KL5DA,"I watched the entire series on Amazon Prime for free, which was a stellar experience. To get all of this entertainment free was worth the cost of my Amazon Prime membership. Now, on to the show...

I was riveted to every episode with a stunned wonder at what goes on behind the scenes of a family-owned mortuary business. Second to that were the engaging characters and sometimes rather depressing life stories that were so compelling that it didn't put me off the show. This would have been less of a great show if not for the ghosts of the deceased appearing here and there to lend their wisdom and gallows humor to coping with their deaths and bringing understanding and closure for the ones who remained behind.

No spoilers here, and not naming names, but a percentage of the main characters get killed off, esp toward the last season. My favorite character was Claire. She could have carried the whole show on her back. Nate and David, too. The acting and scripts were first-rate and nothing in my life could have ever predicted that a show about a mortuary-owning family would become iconic and one of my favorite series of all time.

I cried buckets during the series finale. Get the Kleenex ready!

Ugh, I can't even tell you how much I miss this ensemble cast. I thought of them in my real life many times at odd moments, as they became almost like real people I knew and cared about. The series was a stunning tour de force and now I follow the careers of those fine actors and writers to see what they are up to on their newer shows.

Farewell, ensemble cast of Six Feet Under. I spent hundreds of hours getting to know all of you. Fabulous series and highly recommended.",1405036800,,1683,4.504918032786885
2012405,5,B0001KL5DA,"Excellent season for SFU, as if there weren't enough people that had already written it. I would go into this further, but just watch it. Amazon should just let you give something five stars and not have to write a bunch of crap about it when hundreds of people have already chimed in their two bits. This seems to be a weakness in the system, just this endless need for new words to appear just so the reviews can ""seem"" fresh. Give it a rest already, just let people contribute a few stars and move on.",1405036800,,504,4.260416666666667

And also the whole part about them trying to sound so smart and all this crap about art and how it evokes emotions and makes you think and blah blah blah. The worst part...I don't like ANY of the characters. I mean they are all jerks. I've never watched a show where all of the characters are like the worst people ever. Actually Fredrico is the only one I actually like. The rest....well heck it wouldn't bother me if they all died on the show. I think the worst two are Claire and Nate. The girl who plays Claire....omg she needs to get over herself. She isn't a very good actress but seeing her in this show she acts like she is the best thing out there. NOT. Look it really is interesting, but you kinda get mad watching it because, again, most of it not all of the characters are a**holes!",1404777600,,952,4.2076502732240435

2012450,3,B0001KL5DA,"A very different series due to the funerary background, but also bordered on pornography due to the multiplicity of depictions of both heterosexual and homosexual encounters.  Then there was the constant use of the ""F"" word; far beyond what one would encounter in the real world.....in any place short of an all male factory environment.  Though the story line was interesting and the acting excellent, the overuse of sex and foul language detracted rather than added to the story.  Most definitely unsuited for young impressionable minds and those who would be offended by the two factors mentioned above.",1404000000,,606,5.163265306122449

2012462,5,B0001KL5DA,The characters are all dysfunctional from just a little to all out nuts. I can see some of my slightly neurotic friends and family in parts of all these characters. It is easy to watch from the outside looking in because you know what they need to just get a grip on life. This is the equivalent of armchair quarter backing for the non sports type. Like Michael Hall from Dexter. Felt really sad when the last episode aired and all the endings were tied up for every character.,1403740800,,477,4.370786516853933

I loved all these guys but by the end of Season 3 I didn't even like them. The only reason I finished the show is I heard the Series finale is among one of the best ever. Edit) I quit the show midway thru Season 4. After Season 2 the series just sunk deeper and deeper into an Obsession with Sexual Dysfunction. Even making Ruth, the Mom, part of it... And a Joke. In Season 4 they drag Rico & Claire into it. That's when I quit. No matter how the good the Series Finale the damage can't be undone.",1403740800,,622,3.905511811023622

The characters become more fully fleshed than in the first season and it is easier to like them and actually care about what happens to them. Subject matter is probably iffy for those under 14 or anyone uncomfortable with the harsh realities of death.

2012494,5,B0001KL5DA,"This series is based around a family-owned funeral parlor but it is really about the human relationships of the principal characters who span many generations. It deals with just about anything imaginable without wandering into the ridiculous. It has its humorous moments but is really a drama. However, it is not depressing. The acting is superb and quite addictive. We are great fans of British series and it is refreshing to see an American production that is truly first rate. There is some foul language but not so much that most adults can't handle. The same applies to sex scenes.",1402963200,,587,4.88

2012505,5,B0001KL5DA,"If only you knew how realistic things are in the show!  Having worked in the same setting, it was both sad and funny at the same time....Funny reaction simply due to the stress and sadness of dealing with death every day.  Hilarious at times, but still respectful!",1402358400,,264,4.595744680851064
2012506,3,B0001KL5DA,The first season was pretty good.  But my interest level continued to wane as the second season went on.  There really needed to be more plot development.  I finally stopped watching the series.,1402012800,,194,4.818181818181818

2012513,4,B0001KL5DA,"One of my favorite series. Each episode has a unique and personal story that will be completed and the secondary plotline that involves the ongoing stories of the members of the undertaking family. Zany flashback conversations with the father who died in an initial episode, conversations with offbeat bereaved clients and conversations with their deceased clients all seem if not plausible at least acceptable way to keep the episodes moving along. Controversial subjects abound but do not interfere with the very interesting plots.",1401580800,,533,5.433734939759036

2012523,5,B0001KL5DA,"The entire series is in my opinion the best series HBO has ever done. I saw the Sopranos was given this accolade recently but I totally disagree. Here are my reasons. Six Feet Under has deep rich and profound characters who you really care about and have everyday life crises to deal with that we can all relate to. How many people are mobsters??

Second there are strong rich female characters in this series that drive the drama and they get a good amount of screen time, not the less than 17% that Geena Davis's research institute has proven for women and girls across the board for the majority of media including feature film, TV series and animation. Isn't a little over 50% of the world population women and girls -so why do we accept depictions of males as more interesting? Writers, directors and producers need to do better and be more creative with their characters, this show shows that it is possible to have great female characters as rich and entertaining as any of their male counterparts, and they do not have to kill or be murdered by a mobster to achieve that.

Thirdly we are all going to die and this show profoundly explores that reality in every episode touching on all classes, situations, ages, race and gender. It is not just about knocking people off or gratuitous violence even though some of these deaths do occur violently. Six Feet Under explores death and grieving as well as the difficult aspects of burying a loved one again a complex and human way that we can all relate to.

I enjoyed every season of this series and final episode is by far one of the best HBO written/produced episodes of any series they have ever done. Kudos to Alan Ball he knows how to write for all types of characters including great gay characters and real believable relationships too, David and Keith are one of the best male couples depicted in a main stream series, and Claire's dabble with sexuality was also completely believable and well written.  I am sure all the people involved in this series must feel honored to be part of such a great work, in my mind it goes down as the best!",1386201600,5,2101,4.550264550264551

Amazon Canada is selling the complete series for $61 CDN which equals about $58 US Dollars.
Canada is also Region 1 (North America), so it should play fine on your U.S. players.",1384041600,,297,4.321428571428571
2012526,5,B0001KL5DA,This is my absolute favorite series of all time. If you think your Job sucks and you have a hard day at work and with family imagine that your family is your business and you own and run a funeral home. Imagine you may have to bury your own family members or you lose friends and loved ones and your family is riding you back that its still a business yet while personal secrets are showing up during the funeral with the ridiculous requests that are made. Now throw in all the other troubles with life and your personal life this makes for the best entertaining series that HBO has ever done in my opinion. This is season two of five.,1382313600,,635,4.256198347107438

I ordered all seasons of six feet under and only one of the five boxes was in mint condition all other four boxes were broken, cracked and ripped. The box they came in was in good condition so it seemed like the products was already damaged at the Amazon facility.

2012557,4,B0001KL5DA,"The more I watch this show the less I care about these people.  There's no doubt that it's extremely well made, well written and well acted.  But I wonder if there are viewers out there who actually like any of these characters.  My first thought was about Brenda, who isn't exactly a bad person but doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities.  As the series unfolded I began to feel the same way about each of the main characters in turn.  What's interesting is that the dad, who everyone blames for their problems, doesn't seem to be the reason at all--it's the rest of them who are effed up and completely self-involved.  If anyone ever talked to me the way they talk to each other, I would be out the door in a heartbeat.  Of course, there are people in the world like this--I've known many--who are pointedly malicious to each other, and they all take it and spew it out over and over again.  It used to be that every story, any story, had to create some kind of empathy for its characters.  Even if they were mean, rotten people, there had to be something we could relate to, some grain of humanity we could latch onto, even if we hated them.  In essence, we had to care about them on some level for the story to work.  Amazingly, though, the end of the 20th century saw the overturning of this age-old rule and began to create stories in which we feel nothing for the characters and could care less what happens to them but still somehow engages us.  Six Feet Under didn't start out that way for me, but after season two I find that it has carried on this newly-created tradition, and still I want to watch it.",1296518400,3,1626,4.33003300330033

Season 1 was a little slow for me, but I am so glad that I stuck it out.  In this season we come to know the characters better, the stories get a bit more interesting and it becomes apparent that death happens in many ways and there's always an interesting story behind it and behind the person.

I have enjoyed the whole series from start to finish. I'll watch it again too.,1207353600,,341,3.9420289855072466
2012571,5,B0001KL5DA,"In its second season, Six Feet Under continues to brilliantly build on what was established in the first season.  There were many stand-out episodes, particularly in the earlier portion of the season, and the directions each of the characters were taken is very interesting.  Federico, a character I found myself disliking during Season One, was developed quite a bit more.  Keith, on the other hand, showed an uglier side of himself that added some great drama into his relationship with David, which is one of the main plot lines of this season.

Come to think of it, each of the character arcs were risky in this season, and most of them paid off.  I'm not left with that ""I need to know what happens next"" as I was with the last season, but what I am is excited to see how these stories will continue.  The use of music and the direction continues to be phenomenal and I'm willing to bet that at least nine of these episodes will make you cry, and that all of them will make you laugh.  The plots jump around from Nathan/Brenda's relationship, to David/Keith's drama, to Ruth's situation with herself and Nikolai, to Claire's budding interest in the arts, and many more, but you'll never find yourself swamped by 'too many things going on at once.'  Each episode is planned well, leaving you feeling sad when the show ends with a white-out and the credits begin to roll.

I usually don't talk much about Special Features when reviewing a DVD unless the extras are really horrible or are outstanding, but I have to comment on Alan Ball's commentary track for ""The Last Time.""  While Ball is, in my opinion, one of the best writer/directors out there, this commentary track is a joke.  It consists of him saying ""this is a good scene because ___ did a good job"" and then just letting the scene play without further comment.  The only thing other than the occasional talk of camera work (all of that is in the first five minutes) is him laughing at one of the jokes every now and then.  Why even bother putting a commentary track if you aren't going to comment on the work?

But--special features aside--the second season of this brilliant show is absolutely a must-have.  I'm not quite sure whether or not it's better or as good than the first season, but fans of the first won't be disappointed.

2012573,5,B0001KL5DA,"I have often heard people say that All in the Family could never be produced today. I think this is true, at least, for network television (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX). All in the Family captures a specific moment in both television and American history. Carroll O'Connor excellently renders the American bigot, Archie Bunker, and puts him up for scrutiny before a live audience. All in the Family was not entirely about political correctness and bigotry, but when you look back at the show, those social forces remain the reasons why it couldn't be produced today.

Six Feet Under, uncensored, would certainly have no chance of being broadcast either. The politically correct imperative of contemporary American culture would sue and complain it to be another ""wardrobe malfunction."" The malfunction, however, is in the emotional and intellectual dishonesty of most TV shows today, of most mainstream culture today. I think almost all of television is a cartoon. I like Six Feet Under because it is not a does not turn its homosexual characters into the prancing man-boys of Will & Grace. The violence in Six Feet Under is well earned and integral to the drama and comedy of the series. The sex and human relationships in Six Feet Under are complicated and weird, which is completely normal. Mostly, it's refreshing to watch a show that cares about story and character instead of explosions, statutory sex objects, and impossibly melodramatic events.

If All in the Family reflects a political awakening, taught through comedy, then Six Feet Under reflects a response to political correctness. The bigotry that All in the Family responds to is as monolithic and misanthropic as the political correctness Six Feet Under is responding to. Bigotry and political correctness are merely two sides of the same dishonesty; they are rules and codes for human behavior and expression that do not work out in real life. Archie Bunker was certainly not a subtle guy, but his assumptions about people different from him were wrong (and funny). Now, when everything is subtle and on politically correct eggshells, people are no longer honest. That's what Six Feet Under is about to me: We need to relearn how to trust others enough to be honest, and I think Six Feet Under accurately argues that not all honesty is mean, and avoiding confrontation isn't always nice.

In the end, HBO does with Six Feet Under what the networks used to do: Respect the intelligence, maturity, and humanity of the audience.",1171670400,6,2484,4.995169082125604

2012575,3,B0001KL5DA,"The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a clich cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.

BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.

PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win!",1167782400,10,2068,4.647540983606557

2012578,5,B0001KL5DA,"I recently finished watching the final season of SFU, having bought the DVD set right after its release last month. I have watched the show for three years, beginning with the first season in 2003, a year after my arrival in the US, and purchasing the DVD set of each following season upon their release. I am completely with another reviewer who said that she would sell crack on street if it means limitless SFU. For the last three years, SFU has been a fail-proof anti-depressant for me. Although some see it as deeply depressing, and I agree with them, that very depressing quality always eased my own depression and pain, and strangely enough, made me feel more calm, peaceful, clear, and focused. More than that, it let me see that certain profound yet non-religious spirituality is possible in American pop culture and Americans themselves (one of the misconceptions non-Americans, like me, have about American culture is that, amid the ascendency of fundamentalist Christianity, it is essentially shallow and materialistic, or that it may be characterized as having what Shakespeare called ""irreligious piety""?).

I can go on and on about how much I learned from SFU, how great consolation I got from it. So, as a big fan of the show, I see every season as a gem on its own. However, if I am forced to pick my favorite season, I'd pick season 2. It is more relaxed and yet, strangely again, more intense than the first season. Relaxed because I now know what to expect for the Fisher family and their funeral home, and intense because, as one of the axes of the plot-the relationship between Nate and Brenda-unfolds, I see a painful yet true description of why it is so hard for two people to stay together. Also, compared to following three seasons, it contains more of its trade-mark dark humor.

In the Special Feature of the final season, creator Alan Ball tells us that Peter Krause's performance of Nate breathed an ""amazing everyman quality"" into the character, and while portraying this ""everyman,"" that Nate was the one character with a stronger spiritual, (or mystical), bent. This makes perfect sense. Looking back, in the first episode of the Season 2, we see Nate jotting down what his father says in his dream, which turns out to be from Bhagavad Gita. The episode ends beautifully with Nate reading his notes to Brenda, which read: ""All that lives lives forever. Only the shell, the perishable, passes away. The spirit is without end, eternal, deathless."" Here is one of the earliest moments when the contrast between the mentalities of Brenda and Nate is made, a contrast which will be more dramatically depicted in the latter episodes of the final season.

I spent a fortune (""fortune"" indeed, considering my miserable income as a graduate student) on the DVD sets of SFU. But it was money well spent, since every episode is infinitely re-watchable and leads us to think about issues that are important.",1144713600,16,2928,4.828685258964144

2012588,5,B0001KL5DA,"If you haven't seen Season One, stop reading this right now and go watch it.  You're in for a real treat, as 6FU is one of the most well-written TV dramas ever.

If you watched Season Two when it originally aired and are considering purchasing this set, you should know that the DVD extras are not plentiful.  Several of the 13 episodes have optional commentaries you can listen to while you're watching the episode; I find this is a big investment of time for a small payoff, but that's just me.  Plus, the last disc contains a short documentary ""anatomy of a stiff,"" which is worth watching once, but not really that compelling.  Another factor that might affect your purchase decision is that the episodes themselves are rich and stand up to repeated viewings, unlike most of the tripe on television.  Plus, watching the episodes on DVD - on YOUR schedule - makes for a much better experience than waiting a week or more between episodes as they are aired on HBO.

If you've seen Season One but not Season Two yet, the best indicator of whether you'll like Two is how much you liked One.  Yes, it's true, fans disagree over which of the first two seasons was better.  But the overwhelming majority that liked One a lot also liked Two a lot.

I think both of the first two seasons were EXCELLENT, but a bit different.  Almost every episode of the first season was very good or excellent.  The second season had the same average quality as the first season, but more variability - that is, a few episodes or storylines were a bit weaker than what we typically saw in Season One, but other episodes and storylines were even better than those in Season One.  The last two episodes of Season Two rank among the best television I've ever seen.

I will try to set up the events of Season Two without giving anything away.  At the end of Season One, Nate was coming to grips with a newly diagnosed brain condition that could cause seizures, or even a stroke and death.  Nate and Brenda had declared their love for each other, despite a fairly complicated and sometimes rocky relationship.  David was single and struggling in his love life, and coming to terms with being ""out.""  He and Keith were still friends, and it was clear that they still had feelings for each other.  These storylines are developed further in Season Two, with many interesting twists and turns along the way.  Of course, there are also storylines involving Ruth and Claire.  Ruth's growth in Season Two is nonlinear - she seems to make progress in one episode, but then reverts back to her depressed, repressed, controlling self in the next.  Claire has interesting relationships with different people, each of which shapes her in some way, good or bad, and she gets a bit of direction in her life toward the end of Season Two.

One of the things that makes 6FU so great is that it's so real.  The characters are 3-dimensional, flawed, and (mostly) likeable.  Whenever I watch the show after not having seen it for a month or more, it's like getting together again with old friends.  I also respect the show for taking seriously the issues of religion and minority sexual orientation (Amazon.com has previously censored me for using the word that begins with ""h"").  Half of the main characters are religious, and their views are treated very respectfully.  One or two of the main characters are g__ (again trying to avoid the censor) and they are portrayed as real people, with the same joys and sorrows and problems as straight folks.

Bottom line:  If you haven't seen 6FU season two yet, you are in for a real treat.  Be patient through the first two episodes, though, as their slightly lower quality is not representative of the rest of this outstanding season.",1108857600,64,3734,4.62917933130699

2012590,4,B0001KL5DA,"The only reason why I started to watch this show was because the first three episodes were free at the public library. And boy, did I get hooked. I loved this show to death-the characters were so rich and fulfilling and colorful and likeable, and the season finale was gripping. When we last left the show, Nate discovered that he had AVM, a brain condition, David came out of the closet, Brenda decided to institutionalize her brother and other half of her life, Billy, Claire's bad-boy boyfriend, Gabriel, robbed a store, and Ruth started a sexual affair with Nokolai, her boss. Now, as we enter the second season, it starts off with a bang, then getts dull, then ends with a big bang. In my opinion, it started off really well for the first four episodes, then it got really dull and tedious, then the last two episodes were amazing. In this season, Nate begins to rethink his life with AVM, Gabriel digs himself further to his grave and takes Claire down with him (God I miss that guy), Ruth begins to get overzealous of her relationship (and go with The Plan), and David ponders his life without Keith. And oh that Brenda. Now, with Billy out of her life, she takes on a hobby-writing a novel. And oh, yeah-cheating on Nate. She used to be really likeable and real in her insecurities (...). And the same goes to Keith-he's getting too confusing and and tough for David. And here's another complaint-too many unnecessary subplots, such as Keith's neice, Taylor-as much as I like her, STAY OUT OF THE FISHER FAMILY! One bright spot is the wonderful Patricia Clarkson as Ruths' bohemian, Joni-Mitchell-playing sister, Sara. She looks like she has a blast playing it. And kudos to the amazing Lili Taylor for playing Lisa, an old friend of Nate's.

It simply doesn't strike me as a very promising TV soups, not the award credits, not the packaging artwork, not the appearance of casts, not at all when I have already ""met"" the both assumingly offbeat Fisher brothers from HBO since the first season, and their family and friends. Personal serious hallucination aside, I don't mean ridiculous but if you're lying in bed to die in seven days and all you've got is two box sets of SOPRANOS Season Four and SIX FEET UNDER Season Two, watch the latter first!

Tripping further to the winding of ever delights and surprises of Season One, this season continues to grib your heartbeat and enthral your mind with simple, familiar facts of man's suffering in this contemporary refination of living. Each episode is not afraid to manifying into the core issue of all characters while suggesting a look on the upside however. Turning points from this season will be Nate's (Krause) fate from a bad struck surgery, his rocky coping with Brenda (Griffith) breaking further from self-haunting recovery, Ruth's (Conroy) final wakefulness of making decision to end her clingy affair with co-worker Nikolai, both David's (Hall) and Keith's (Patrick) parenting effort for as if more of mending a past domestic issue for the latter, Federico's (Diaz) by-chance partnership of Fisher & Son's, and at last not forgetting Claire's (Ambrose) artistic coming to term with her persistent teenage angst.

Adding a little sparks to the season are pagan but earthy Aunt Sarah (Patricia Clarkson) and Nate's former indifferent live-in Lisa (Lili Taylor) from Seattle. Also noteworthy is Brenda's mildly schizophrenic parent Margaret (Joanna Cassidy).

The main thrust of this season is on Nate and Brenda's relationship. Spiralling downward and out of control, Brenda (played maginficently by Rachel Griffiths) is perhaps the most sexually psychotic character TV has seen. This one particular storyline kept me anticipating each week's new episode. As Nate (Peter Krause) slowly discovers and puts the pieces together of Brenda's psychosis you can't help be caught up in this web of deciet. The confrontation between Nate and Brenda can only be compared to that of The Soprano's final episode of season four...where Carmella throws Tony out and doesn't look back.

2012594,5,B0001KL5DA,"It seems somehow fitting that, for a show whose central setting is a funeral home, the characters and storylines within it are brought more vividly to life than in most television dramas. ""Six Feet Under"" focuses on brothers Nate and David, running their family funeral business under the paranoid eye of their mother, Ruth. I wouldn't want to go into too much detail here about the various plotlines, but I watched the entire second season on DVD in almost one sitting--and it was thoroughly satisfying. I like how each episode begins with one random sequence of events, with the end result someone dying in an unexpected (or sometimes expected) way. At the end of that first scene, the name and years the person lived appears on the screen on a white background. That person's death is worked into the episode, as Nate and David have to handle the funeral for Fisher and Sons.

The acting is also great all around and the direction and cinematography are of film quality, which is not suprising, considering that Alan Ball (American Beauty) created the series and wrote and directed a number of episodes. A quality, quality show--it's funny, and has much to say about life, death, love, relationships, and the wonder and weirdness of human existence.",1092528000,3,1252,4.877934272300469
2012595,5,B0001KL5DA,"Like many viewers, I don't get HBO, so I got hooked watching Season 1's episodes all at once, on video. The DVD presentation adds commentaries of mixed quality. Writer Jill Solowey opens by wondering why anyone would spend an hour listening to her talk. ""You must not have a life if you're here,"" she says. Unnecessarily demeaning to viewers, as commentaries add a whole layer of enjoyment to the viewing experience.

 Other commentators pointed out the old-fashioned Addams family quality of the Fishers, which I hadn't noticed -- but now I see they have an avocado-colored refrigerator! And I see the contrast between the timeless, stifling ambience of the funeral home and the free-spirited world that the family encounters outside.

 Season 2's writers faced a major challenge because plots need conflict and at least two sources of conflict have disappeared. Nate has now firmly committed to being a funeral director -- he gets his license early in the season -- and he's firmly allied with his brother's interests. And David, now officially out as a gay man, has a choice of nice dates before ending up (as we always suspected) with the charismatic Keith.

 The Christmas episode was my favorite, although it was more satisfying than suspenseful. A group of Harley Davidson riders gathers to honor a fallen comrade, while the Fishers remember their last moments with their father. The biker funeral was a treat. I'd like my own funeral to be a big party too, although I hope my heirs have the sense to demand a cheap cremation rather than a ten thousand dollar box.

 As other reviewers have noted, Nate takes the lead this season, possibly because his character seems least controversial and most sympathetic. He's grown into a compassionate, caring person, even befriending a young man dying friendless with pancreatic cancer. Pushing the cremation button seems an odd but sincere act of friendship.

 At the same time, I found it hard to like either of Nate's girlfriends -- the neurotic Brenda and the needy, vulnerable Lisa. Nate deserves someone he can respect.

 And I disagree with those who call this family ""dysfunctional"" and ""repressed."" While the rabbi in Season 2 preaches the importance of total honesty, in fact research shows that marriages often stay together more by what's not said than by openness.

 Compared to most families, the Fishers are not bad! Rememer they see each other every day and support one another through tough times. And they do show mutual respect. Ruth may be controlling but she gives her children a lot of space. She even seems a little intimidated by Claire, who was born after the boys were almost grown.

 The commentators suggest that the show goes to great lengths for realism. However, in a contemporary police department, Keith would not be on duty while under investigation for killing a citizen. He'd turn over his gun and badge and be off duty with pay. He would also be required -- not advised, required -- to see the police psychologist. These steps probably would have prevented the next tragedy, where Keith lashes out during a domestic violence call.

 Seasons 3 to 5 are out, I hear, so we know Nate will recover and go on to more adventures. Other reviewers have suggested issuing Season 3 on DVD as soon as possible. I couldn't agree more!",1090713600,20,3307,4.885509838998211
2012596,4,B0001KL5DA,"The second season, honestly speaking, is not as fascinating as the first one. Yet, it still outstands lots of other dramas. The first season strikes many of us because of its style and the captivating characterisation. Each character is so distinguished from each other and each has his/her own charm. Once we are used to this formula, season 2 seems to offer less surprise to the audience. However, what season 2 does is to complicate the plot and the closure of each problem still brings joy to many of us.
The most brilliant part is season 2 is the adding of Taylor, Keith's niece into the drama. She evolves around David and Keith, sharing the homosexual secrets from the child's point of view. It's very interesting and the chemistry IS there. However, what disappoints me most, personally, is the pitification of Ruth, the mother in many episodes. Season 2 tends to victimize Ruth as a mother who shares one-way communication to her Russian lover, Nikolai, and the communication problem worsens between her and her children. Each episode tends to amplify this theme of victimhood and even in epsiode 13, her strong will is not restored completely. The whole season ends with a scene in which Claire and David hug their mother for love and concern when Nate is undergoing an AVM surgery.
Season 2 also brings more emphasis on the sidecast of the drama. Rico and his wife, Brenda's parents or even Brenda's new prostitute friend do stir a certain storm in the character's life. The second season extends the problems plotted in the first season - Keith and David's crisis, Nate's health problem, Brenda's obsession with wild sex, Ruth's incompetence and helplessness and Claire's cynicism. All these themes are touched in season 2.
Everybody who loves the first 2 seasons is waiting desperately for Season 3 on DVD. I just hope the studio does not take another 9 months to release their money-making discs.",1089158400,6,1910,4.88
2012597,5,B0001KL5DA,"To the gentleman who was upset about the DVDs being offered in full-screen format:
Widescreen is preferable if -- and ONLY if -- the television program was originally shot in widescreen format (as most feature films are).  But if the show was shot using the standard television aspect ratio of 4:3 (as ""Six Feet Under"" was), then you WANT it in full-screen format, because that's how it was intended to be seen.  A lot of shows are adding black letterbox bars to their DVD releases in an effort to make the shows look more ""cinematic,"" but if the show was not originally shot in widescreen, the black bars are actually COVERING UP part of the frame, damaging the composition in order to appeal to DVD collectors who don't realize that NOT EVERYTHING is shot in 1.65:1.
""Six Feet Under"" is being presented the way it was shot and the way the series' directors wanted it to be seen.  Kudos to HBO for NOT presenting the series in faux-widescreen.",1088640000,28,944,4.607142857142857

Also, in response to a review posted earlier, the reason the West Wing is in widescreen format is because starting with the second season, the show itself was filmed in widescreen.  I assume that Siz Feet Under is filmed in regular Full Frame.  Even though I agree that widescreen is superior, you just can't change full frame to widescreen.",1088553600,2,506,4.408602150537634

2012601,5,B0001KL5DA,"After so much waiting, the second series of this continously addictive to watch HBO finally gets it's DVD and this is not only a season that holds it's own against the high standards set in the first year, but actually manages to surpass it with thirteen truly electrifying episodes. From Nate's AVM plot thread, the arrival of Lisa (with child) and Brenda's sex addiction, Six Feet Under firmly proves why it's the best drama on the box just of late. Other noteworthy events includes David and Keith's reunion, only ratcheted by Karla's arrest and the boys ""adopting"" Taylor, Claire finally getting out of  high school and giving Gabe the heave ho and Ruth's relationship with Nikolai and little Maya's arrival. Episode highlight definitely include the opener and finale (In The Game and The Last Time), Christmas themed episode It's The Most Wonderful Of The Year when the Fisher clan and Federico (still a little underused here) commemorate Nathaniel's passing, The Secret with Brenda's trip with Melissa to the Orange County and penultimate number I'll Take You where Nate and Brenda are finally forced to confront one another as well as Ruth's foul mouthed encounter with a self-help guru in The Plan and David's brief dalliance with public defender Ben in The Invisible Woman. On the extra front, it's pretty samey, but at least there are more episode commentaries here than season one, and let's face it while this show hasn't produced a bad season in it's run, this is by far the best of the bunch. Enjoy.",1085443200,,1513,4.88715953307393
2012602,5,B0001KL5DA,"This is one of the smartest shows on television, and Season 2 is no exception.  Much of the action is paced slower than Seasons 1 and 3, but it's still an incredible season that focuses on Nate's secret illness, the relationship between David and Keith, and Brenda's...um...new hobbies.  I don't understand why it took over 2 years for Season 2 to be released, but I'm glad it's finally coming out, and I hope Season 3 won't be far behind.  (I wish the cover of the Season 2 DVD set was a bit more unique, though...I loved the corpse/lipstick image used for Season 1, and I think they could have come up with something a bit more creative instead of just slapping the standard logo on there, but oh well.)",1081209600,,705,4.449612403100775

Barring the whole funeral business, this is my family; dysfunctional, blunt, and interesting. Anyone with a dark sense of humor and the gift of sarcasim will pull up a chair and lose themselves in the rich, morbid, and sometimes bluntly honest world of the Fishers. The only problem now is that HBO can't get the darn things out on DVD fast enough for myself or other fans.",1080086400,4,501,4.693181818181818
2012604,5,B0001KL5DA,"Honestly, I'm more excited for the THIRD season (arguably the best so far, with, I think, the best season closer), and season two is probably my least favorite of the three seasons so far.  BUT, the show was still great, and within the context of the series, essential viewing.
A good deal of season two is devoted to setting up the action for season three (For instance, the introduction of Lisa, Brenda's actions, David and Keith's relationship, etc), so it sometimes feels like more of a build-up than a payoff (especially in retrospect).  In fact, one of the main storylines is left in suspense til the season three opener.  But the remainder of these plots still remain entertaining and do have closure in one sense or another.  And of course, there's still plenty of entertaing dead-person-of-the-episode plots keeping things fresh.
Overall, the second season, despite it's sophomore year faults, is still some of the best that television has to offer, and a must-have for any fan.",1078790400,4,987,4.927710843373494

2012617,5,B0001KL5DA,"Six Feet Under is one of the best shows I have seen, with the exception of the third season, and finally, I can add the second season to my collection.  The second season is much like the first season, interpersonal reations exposed through conversations with the deceased patrons of their establishment, sex, lies, the usual and unusual.  The third season went horribly wrong between the first and thirteenth episodes, when they walked away from the formula that worked, but successfully regained composure in the end.  For issues like homosexuality, corporation take over, death, life, sex, career, the cast tries to find their way through the world.  This is a very good show and well worth paying to watch, except the third season, take a nap through that.",1077580800,9,760,4.960629921259843

The first season was released Feb. 2003...and now we get the second season June 2004!!!....oh man...on this rate if the show would to go off the air next season...we have to wait till 2008 to get it!!.
Anywho, the set includes some great episodes and further develops all the members of the Fisher family. In this season, the show begins to depart with basing its entire show around a particular death...and develops some more uniformed and intriguing storyline within the characters themselves. It promptly picks up where the last season ended off with Nate's impending surgery. I'll be first to admit that the first episode is kind of a clunker...but the show never looks back from then on. The last two episodes in particular reach almost unbearable depths of dramatic height especially with all the trails and tribulations concerning the relationship between Nate and Brenda. An engaging, quirky show which truly shows you the emotional levels that a television show can still have on the average viewer. I cant tell you how much I honestly love this show.

Comon people, HBO releases their DVD box set yearly.  The first was released in Feb, then the second will be in FEb.
Look at The Sopranos, they released the DVD every August.
Sex and the City, every May.
be patient, you're getting there, Feb is just around the corner.
Anyway, I'd give the second season 9/10 if the first season is 10/10.  The wit, the drama, the shock, the controversy are all there.  I love it when Patricia Clarkson told Ruth to back off.

8013778,5,B0001KL5DA,This is one of the best shows ever created for television ever.,1526256000,,63,4.333333333333333
8013779,5,B0001KL5DA,"Seasons 1-2 get a full 5 stars. They're sad, funny, and clever.
Season 3 gets a -5 stars, the ""Lisa Season."" The ""Joe Lies, Joe Lies, When He Cries"" actress from Say Anything. REALLY, no one cares about this character.
Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind? So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?

Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?

If you have NOTHING else to do, watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good, and then move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just slow and depressing. And the abrupt unoriginal lazy ending is an insult, both to the characters and the viewer.",1519084800,,2689,4.708510638297873

8013781,5,B0001KL5DA,"This is, without a doubt, the best TV series ever (at this stage of time). Yes, better than The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men. The series finale is breathtaking. I watched it when it first aired and it's still with me to this day.",1518739200,,246,4.25531914893617

8013784,4,B0001KL5DA,"Not a great show & I know life would be fine if I never saw it.
But this show is quirky & a pert' good show to pass the time with.
I know I will probably look at the next season, especially since football season does not start for a few more days.",1503964800,,247,3.6792452830188678
