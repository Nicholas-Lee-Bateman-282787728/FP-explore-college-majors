2356371,5,B000A3I3HE,"I bought the Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing based on the other reviewers comments and it was perfect for me.  Great pace for beginners, presented in a logical manner, and highly recommended if you're new to line dancing.  I can't imagine trying to jump right in and pick dances up without knowing what I now know.  Great job!",1148083200,17,328,4.52542372881356
2356372,5,B000A3I3HE,"I purchased the DVD last week, got it yesterday, and have already learned the five different line dances, not even 24 hours later!  Shawn's knowledge of dance and his awesome teaching skills are what makes this DVD so enjoyable.  He starts out each lesson by explaining the footwork individually, then starts to add them together and before you know it you have completed the whole dance!  He ends each lesson with a few minutes of music so that you can practice all the steps together at the pace you would be dancing with other people.

If you are interested in learning to line dance with a fun informative video, great camera shots, and an experienced instructor, this DVD is definitely for you.",1139270400,44,699,4.704918032786885
2356373,5,B000A3I3HE,"This is a great video for beginners.  It takes you step by step, breaking down each dance into manageable pieces.  My husband refuses to go dancing with me, but tried this video and learned the electric slide in about 10 minutes!  Shawn Trautman makes learning to dance easy!  Much better than the other line dancing video I purchased.",1137024000,30,335,4.724137931034483
2356374,5,B000A3I3HE,"Shawn Trautman is the best dance instructor yet! A great teacher in addition to dancer. I've tried several dance instruction VHS and DVD's (9 in all from Christy Lane, Diane Horner, Teresa Mason, Wiley Hicks, and Cal Pozo), but I didn't stick with them, because they would move so fast that you'd get lost.  I would get tired of starting them over and over just trying to pick up the steps. But Shawn makes it so simple to learn, keeping it at a slower pace for the beginner.  He also throws in some variations for more challenge.  They're so good, I have added 4 of his DVD's to my collection.  But his aren't collecting dust like the others.",1132272000,241,643,4.423728813559322
2356375,5,B000A3I3HE,"I have some friends that wouldn't go dancing. They finally tried.  After learning the basic steps with Shawn they now look forward to getting out on the dance floor.  I'm very pleased!

More people to play with.  Yea-Hooray.",1130976000,38,224,4.815789473684211
2356376,5,B000A3I3HE,"This Line Dance video is just like taking a lesson in a dance studio!  I like the way Shawn describes each step, demonstrates it, and then explains how to do it in a way that can be remembered later -- when it's actually time to get on the dance floor.  I found it especially helpful to have an opportunity during the video lesson to review the learned steps with music while following Shawn's lead!  This relaxed, straightforward approach to learning is fun and the video is a ""must have"" for anyone who is interested in learning to dance quickly!",1130025600,46,548,4.515151515151516
2356377,5,B000A3I3HE,"Wow!  I bought this DVD thinking it would be fun to learn something new, and it turned out to be much more.  The instruction was easy to follow, the picture was super clear, and the speed went at a good clip (didn't need to press pause, and didn't find myself waiting).  I like that Shawn did each move many times, and I could actually get it.  I didn't realize how much of a good workout I would get - my legs were feeling it after the 2nd lesson (yea, I'm a bit out of shape).  Overall, I had a good time and am looking forward to trying more of Shawn's DVD's.  Highly recommended.",1129075200,128,583,4.115044247787611
2356378,5,B000A3I3HE,This DVD was the best way to learn how to do many different line dances.  The movements were broken down into simple easy to do steps that were easy to follow.  There is practice time included after learning each dance.  It starts out with a simple line dance and builds into the more difficult ones so you are building on what you learned in the previous dance.  I did it in my own home so I didn't feel awkward or self conscious about people watching me.  It was easy to go back over a dance step because each dance step is labeled before you learn it.  Now I  know I can go out and do the line dances that are being played!,1127433600,38,626,4.081967213114754
2356379,5,B000A3I3HE,"From the very beginning, the background music got me psyched to dance.  The teaching methods make learning this so easy.  Shawn begins with one step, gets you comfortable with that, and then builds on it.  Before you know it, you're dancing!!  After watching this video, I look forward to getting out on the dance floor with confidence.",1127088000,30,336,4.842105263157895
2356380,5,B000A3I3HE,"Before, I was afraid to get up and ""learn"" on the dance floor. After spending some time with Shawn's DVD, I was comfortable getting up and dancing with the crowd. My wife was so impressed that she has not stopped telling our friends!",1126742400,29,233,4.441860465116279

2356388,5,B000A3I3HE,"I've been wanting to learn a few of the more popular line dances for a while now but didn't know how well I'd be able to learn. I can tell you that Shawn is an excellent instructor, super cool guy and teaches you along at just a perfect pace. In the first week I've had this DVD, I've learned 3 dances that I'm completely comfortable with and I didn't think that was possible for me? If you're thinking you can't learn how to dance, IMO you definitely can with Shawn's help. I'm so glad I finally did this, I'm really looking forward to my next visit to the country bar!",1487116800,3,570,4.1909090909090905

2356393,5,B000A3I3HE,"This is exactly what I was looking for - goes over each step multiple times and does parts of the ""routine"" before moving on.

It's an excellent  way to learn dance steps if you can endure the repetition particularly for ""brushup"" after watching the first time.  It might be better to just proceed with instruction without reps. and viewers rely on ""rewind.""",1474848000,2,301,4.98

2356402,5,B000A3I3HE,My husband and I just started to learn line dancing this past winter.  One of the residents of our senior park provided lessons for 10 weeks.

It has many of the basic steps for the newer line dances and they still play it in many bars, weddings ect. My hubby and I love the couples dancing. However, my 74 year old mom and my 72 year old aunt LOVE line dancing. Us gals have a blast with it. We meet once a week in the winter, and alittle less in the summer to line dance on Wed nights. It's our own ""Ladies night"". The steps are easy to follow, repeated enough to remember it, and always available to rewatch. The songs are not original on the tape because I think that is difficult to do. We learn it on the DVD and then download the song from itunes and play it right after we practice. Glass of wine, family, line dancin.... that's a great night! PS. Just got the newer line dance DVD, will update when we get going.",1405555200,,876,4.12280701754386

2356448,5,B000A3I3HE,Line Dance 101 is excellent. I have been swing dancing for many years and have recently become a country music fan. Line dancing has always looked like fun and open to individual interpretation so I ordered the disc.

I would recommend this as a starting point for anyone interested in this type of dancing.,1392336000,,413,4.830985915492958

DVD. I thought it would have much  more content.",1364428800,,180,4.0
2356457,4,B000A3I3HE,"I work better when things are broken down and in black & white sometimes, which would have been nice if some sheet of some kind was included. I also wish he would do the dance first then break down the steps so we know what we're working towards. He just jumps right to the steps and I never knew where it was gonna end. I also think the music he has in is like bad 80's wanna be jazz with way to much electric guitar & sax....the songs that accompany the dances would be so much better....
BUT, with the the slow pace that he proceeds...(and constantly using that rewind button) this can be a great DVD......overall I liked it enough to buy the following 4 Line Dance DVDs in this series.

Also, unlike what the most negative reviewer said - you certainly do get to dance every dance to at least a 2 minute piece of music, not including the ""prelude"" before (doing it without music) and build up he does throughout the entire teaching linking recently learnt moves to the building dance. There is also a Full Review section for doing all the dances and moves in a more aerobic style session and the practice for the last dance ""Slappin' Leather"" is included after that session rather than in the end of it's section (unlike the rest).

I no doubt will order whatever comes next when I feel I am ready for it...

I liked that he had us practice to music.  The only tiny thing is that we were taught the electric slide and I so wanted to dance to the real song but we danced to other music instead.  But that, of course is just my own problem.  we were still able to learn the dances and when I turned the electric slide song on the internet I was able to do the dance that Shawn had taught me to that music so it ended up working.

2356486,5,B000A3I3HE,"I've only been line dancing for a couple of months and I'm having a blast.  I take 2 classes a week, so I'm going at a pretty good pace.  I bought his DVD's so I could work on dancing on the days when I'm not taking a class.  And most of these (not all) are already a review for me.  BUT I must say that some of his explainations for some of the steps involved are MUCH better than I've heard before.  He gives great instructions and shows more than once how to do the dance.  I love ethe picture in a picture in the lessons.  I only wish I could take some real lessons from him, I bet that would be a blast!
Now as far as the music goes, some folks will be dissapointed that he doesn't actually use the music that one would normally use to dance the dances he teaches.  I'm going to make a wild guess and say that it would be very expensive for him to get a license for each of the dances and would make the cost of the DVD go way up.  I can live with the music he provides.  I do wish that he'd make a point of telling us on each dance what music is usually used for that dance, he did that a time or two, but I don't think with each dance.
I would recommend his DVD's to anyone, I think that anyone could pop this DVD into their player and be dancing before more than an hour was up!  He'a a good teacher for sure.",1249948800,7,1317,3.858736059479554

I was very excited to get this instructional video in order to ""brush up"" on line dances I haven't done in about 15 years. However, I quickly became disappointed.

Pros: The pros are that Shawn is a great instructor and goes through the steps in such a way that even slow learners (with a poor memory for dance steps) can easily follow and quickly incorporate. Great views and great repetition without becoming annoyingly slow.

Cons (AND FOR ME THIS WAS HUGE): I very much expected to DO the line dance, with the ACTUAL music used for each line dance, as soon as the instruction was completed. Instead, Shawn goes through the instruction of each and does not allow a long enough time for practice. I was hoping at the end of each set of instructions he (and maybe others) would actually be doing the dance to a SONG. Then, I would be able to rewind the DVD to the beginning of each song and practice the dance as many times as I needed to until it became ingrained in my memory. No such luck. I would not buy another one of these videos. I am very, VERY disappointed!",1236124800,154,1336,5.233644859813084

Shawn breaks down each dance into VERY simple steps, and shows you two different angles so you can really understand what it should look and feel like. Since they are in their own segments you can rewind and repeat each step until you are completely comfortable-at the end of the ""step"" lessons they are all tied together and vuala! you're doing an actual dance!

However, I couldn't find any dance DVD's out in the stores.  It was a great choice and I recommend it to everyone interested in step by step learning.",1174953600,14,272,4.4
2356512,3,B000A3I3HE,"You get very basic lessons on five kinds of line dances and I would value this DVD at about $12.  If they would have added a dance session for every kind of dance, I would have felt like I got my money's worth.  By dance session, I mean that they could have videoed people actually using the steps so you could dance along.  Also, the music used was jazzy instead of country - what's up with that?",1174953600,15,397,4.12987012987013
2356513,4,B000A3I3HE,The music at the start of the CD is scarey and I don't know why he used it. After you get by that its ok. He is very good at explaining the steps and if you watch it a few times you'll get the hang of it.,1173657600,12,204,3.3617021276595747
2356514,4,B000A3I3HE,"Having attended numerous weddings and parties and watching The Electric Slide from the sidelines, Shawn Trautman has made it possible for me to join the fun.  His Line Dancing video is perfect for someone with no experience-he demonstrates and describes each step clearly. Perfect for the novice.",1173312000,19,296,5.297872340425532
2356515,5,B000A3I3HE,I am so glad I purchased this video. It is not fancy. It is plain unhyped instruction. I spent the least time rewinding than all the other dance videos I have tried. The man just knows how to TEACH! I look forward to adding his other videos to my collection.,1168473600,19,258,4.18
2356516,5,B000A3I3HE,"My daughter wanted to learn to dance.  I looked for live dance lessons locally, but dance lessons weren't provided for her age.  I found Shawn's line dance DVD for beginners and bought it.  I had done some line dancing over ten years ago while dating, but I had forgotten everything because I got married and stopped dancing.  I remember the frustration I had picking up dance steps at the dance hall.  If the dance hall I attended offered lessons, it was hard to hear the dance instructors and hard to see the instructors feet(lots of people were blocking my view).  In my opinion Shawn's DVD is much better than live dance lessons.  He clearly demonstrates basic dance steps for each line dance and provides alternate dance steps to spice it up.  It is easy to hear him talk and it is easy to see his feet.  The beautiful thing about the DVD format is that I control the pace of the instruction.  Shawn's instruction is easy to follow; however, I keep the remote control for the DVD player handy and push the review button if I need to see something over again.  I don't feel pressure which makes it fun.  Shawn also injects some humor in his instruction which keeps me smiling.  I originally bought it for my daughter, but my whole family has gotten involved.  I highly recommend Shawn Trautman's Line Dance 101 DVD.  You will be able to line dance.",1167868800,104,1352,4.528925619834711
2356517,5,B000A3I3HE,These dances are a lot of fun and the training is well-coordinated. Highly recommended!,1166572800,14,87,5.285714285714286
2356518,5,B000A3I3HE,"We've all been to weddings where the DJ plays the ""Electric Slide"" or ""Cotton Eyed Joe""  Do you ever wish you could jump up and join in, but worry that you'll misstep and throw the whole crowd off?

This DVD Is for you.  Shawn teaches the very basic steps of several popular line dances in a way that anyone can learn. He takes the time to explain and demonstrate the steps one at at time and offers plenty of time to practice.

Each section offers new and more advanced steps that build on the steps learned in the previous section. You'll learn the basics and some more flashy steps that will add flourish to your dance style.

With these basics, and a few fancy bonus steps, you're sure to be the first to hit the dance floor the next time you hear the ""Slide"" start playing!",1165968000,17,778,4.301369863013699
2356519,5,B000A3I3HE,"I was inspired to learn line dancing when I saw all my relatives doing it at my nephew's wedding reception.  I wanted be up there with them.  I got Shawn Trautman's Line Dancing 101 DVD and now I'm ready!  He makes it so easy to learn.  He takes you step by step, just at the right tempo.  He shows the steps from different angles so you don't have to guess if you're doing it right.  He took me easily from from one dance to another and I got a great workout.  I'm 64 years old, and I only wish I had found Shawn Trautman earlier.",1165276800,18,531,4.0
2356520,5,B000A3I3HE,"This DVD was GREAT!  Learning to line dance was much easier than I thought it would be.  I never felt like I couldn't do what Shawn was showing and I really liked the way he broke everything down into simple pieces.  This DVD's really easy to learn from. I ordered both this DVD and the Party Line Dance one and they're equally as good and definitely a great value. Give this one a try first, then go to the Party Line Dances - you'll understand the steps much better. GEORGE",1164067200,13,475,4.2555555555555555
2356521,5,B000A3I3HE,"My husband and I had been looking at getting into line dancing after seeing how much fun everyone was having at the '05 Pumpkin Festival in Bradenton, FL. We had tried it out on the dance floor after watching others for awhile, but found ourselves feeling out of place and embarassed being around everyone that looked like they'd been doing it for years.

I did some research on the web and ended up purchasing a couple different DVDs and this is FAR AND AWAY THE BEST! Besides being the best instruction I had seen, the DVD was very easy to follow and the setting was perfect as we could practice in our living room and work on the steps.

After less than a week with the DVD, we were comfortable enough to try our steps out at a local country bar. We actually fit in and looked like we belonged there! It was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life as we've now been making a point to go out at least once a week together and have met many great friends in the process.

Thank you Shawn! Please don't ever stop making these DVDs as you have a gift and it has made my husband and I both VERY happy.

We're looking forward to trying the new Two-Step ones and we've already ordered all of the new Swing discs so we can learn some more dances.",1163721600,15,1251,4.2217573221757325
2356522,5,B000A3I3HE,This is the fourth Shawn Trautman DVD that I've gone through and this has now become my favorite - probably becasue I can do it alone!  I've always wanted to learn line dancing but wasn't quite sure of myself.  I had an awesome time with this one and really felt confident by the end of it.  Pick this one up if you're looking for something fun to do by yourself or even with some friends - it's a great start.,1163462400,8,410,4.1
2356523,3,B000A3I3HE,This is really for beginners. If you never did line dancing this product is for you.,1163116800,11,84,4.3125
2356524,5,B000A3I3HE,"I am teaching line dance classes for ""very beginner"" students and I liked Shawn's teaching techniques of breaking down the basic steps at the beginning.  I tried doing that in my class and it went very well. I was able to explain the moves so they could catch on easier after watching  and hearing Shawn's explanations. I liked the music he uses when he's instructing.  It's slow, but has a nice beat.  It makes it possible to enjoy dancing while your reveiwing the steps.  I like the dances Shawn has chosen and I really like his style of teaching and dancing. I appreciate being able to find music to use for the dances on his website also.  That is very helpful.

I am anxious to try the other DVD's.",1160697600,12,703,4.403100775193798
2356525,5,B000A3I3HE,I think this DVD is awesome because it is very easy and clear to follow. The steps are droken down and it is a lot of fun at the same time. Not to mention a good work out. I would recommend this DVD to everyone I know.,1154908800,16,218,3.6595744680851063

2356527,5,B000A3I3HE,"This DVD is excellent. I strained my ankle hiking and was bed ridden for three days when this DVD arrived. So I watched it in bed, doing the steps with my hands in the air. I figured out all 5 dances on on this DVD. I have been going line dancing on Thursdays with friends for the past couple of months and could not figure out the dances. After watching this DVD, I completely understand what everyone has been doing. The really cool thing is that all 5 of these dances are done every time I go and sometimes they are done more than once to different songs, so you will definately get your time's worth out of learning these dances - a great value. I can't wait to go back and jump in on the fun.",1152144000,22,697,4.094890510948905
2356528,5,B000A3I3HE,This DVD is great. Shawn teaches the steps and moves so clearly to all the dances. It's so much fun learning them. Five stars for sure. Line dancing is so enjoyable. I highly recommend this one.,1150934400,10,194,4.416666666666667
2356529,5,B000A3I3HE,I loved this DVD.  Most dance instruction videos I've tried are useless.  I watched this one once and already feel comfortable with the dances he teaches on the DVD.  I never felt frustrated.  He breaks everything down so it is so easy to follow.  He also reviews all the steps so you don't have to keep going back.  I would totally recommend this DVD even if you have never danced!,1148947200,23,382,4.385714285714286
2356530,5,B000A3I3HE,I work at a School for Children and Adults with Severe Disabilities. We are constantly looking for new dance steps for our PE class. I ordered the DVD for one of our staff. She is using it to learn and then teach the steps to the students. We feel the instruction is basic enough for our students and fun for the staff.

I was shocked this music was used for a Line dance 101 class. I would really like to know why this music was used. It made it much harder to learn.,1520208000,,294,3.8360655737704916

getting up enough confidence to maybe join a class or go public.",1503014400,4,345,3.8857142857142857
