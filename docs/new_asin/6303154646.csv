7839238,4,6303154646,"This is a great video. This is hatha yoga, so the tape contains no meditation, it focuses on positions and breathing.
The video is divided into separate sections, so that you can put several ones together or just do one, depending on your mood, need of the moment or how much time you have. The sections include: Sun salutation (great morning routine to wake up and stretch out), The Energizer (another great routine, to get you energized and ready to go), Ultimate Stretch (series of great stretches, which will get your rid of many aches, improve blood circulation and increase flexibility), The Classics (classic yoga poses, to tone and stretch various areas) and then an evening routine, to do before going to bed.
I love the Sun Salutation so much that I now included it in my morning routine and I do it every single day, before I do anything else; it really helps me wake up and losen up a stiff neck or back, after being so long in the same position.
The tape is starring Jerry Hall, but the routines are actually guided by her yoga teacher, Vimla Lalvani. She explains the positions very well and guides you through, so if you are a beginner you won't feel overwhelmed.
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't like the alternate breathing technique included in the ""Classics"" routine and I actually never did the evening routine, because I bought it as a workout tape so I only use it during the day, and only used the first 4 routines, which I love and do regularly.
These exercises will improve your posture, your flexibility and your blood circulation and will teach you to breath correctly.",1011225600,2,1610,4.59375
