8019404,3,B00020E3LU,"I picked up this DVD because I wanted segments I could do in the morning - this DVD is great because the 3 in one section allows you to do one, two, or three of the segments, allowing you to control the length of time you want to work out.  The movements are simple, yet challenging.  The first segment is mostly sun salutations.  The second is a more challenging segment with lots of toning - I felt the burn.  The last one is re-energising and calming.  The instructor is a pleasant looking British woman sitting next to a rock pool and an indoor fountain.  The video looks as if it was shot in a hotel somewhere.
There is also a Yoga Dance section which I watched part of but have not yet tried. It's a higher paced workout combining yoga moves.
Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't make use of chapters or other DVD features that might improve it.  When I want to do just the second and third part of the three and one I have to fast forward through the first segment.
The most major flaw in this DVD is that there is no English soundtrack explaining the positions or reminding you to breathe for the 3 in one portion.  There is a French soundtrack, which is a little strange since in the introduction the instructor is dubbed into French.  I found it bizarre that they would employ an English instructor and then not do an English soundtrack.  Even more strange, is that the Yoga Dance does have an English soundtrack.
I don't mind this flaw because I can speak French and it gives me the option of doing the DVD without instruction (with just music playing) but it is kind of a rip-off for those who aren't bilingual or who don't know their ""muscle fessiers"" from their ""coude.""",1082419200,14,1678,4.401294498381877
