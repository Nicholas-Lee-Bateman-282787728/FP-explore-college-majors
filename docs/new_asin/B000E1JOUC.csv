8104122,4,B000E1JOUC,Wow! How come this movie is unknown in the U.S.? The lead actors are two of the most beautiful people I've ever seen on screen. (It is Fuente's first movie!) The John Cale soundtrack (and a guest appearance) plus the junkie theme should make it a hit for any Velvet Underground fan. The only fault is the deus ex abuela ending. That's a small price to pay for a Spanish Drugstore Cowboy... better than the American original. --Mykel,1205798400,,432,4.551282051282051
8104123,5,B000E1JOUC,"The excellent cast makes this Spanish crime/drama a joyride to behold. The beautiful Ariadna Gil, one of my favorite Spanish actress does a splendid job of a women coming un-glued within the world around her. Then hope arrives in the smoldering Carlos Fuentes and the suspenseful journey starts. Fill with enough twists to make this film an evening of pleasure. Even John Cale (who does the musical score for the film) does a performance cameo!",1146700800,,444,4.933333333333334
