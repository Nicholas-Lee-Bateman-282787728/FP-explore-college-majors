8202348,5,B000RQB70O,"This is an thorough and gentle warm up that is easy to follow. Most of it is shot from the back of the studio, so it is easier to learn and follow along as you're watching. Great for injured or older dancers that want a gentle, thorough stretch that strengthens technique but does not abuse or overtax the body. Not for beginners, but great for dancers that can't get to class.",1223510400,3,377,4.323943661971831
8202349,5,B000RQB70O,"I have to say that this is the best dvd of all of the broadway dance dvds, to me anyway.  It is adaptable to beginners even though it was designed for interm/adv. students. I just finished doing it this afternoon and I feel great! It's fast but doable and it stretches out everything.

Setting:  Dance studio with students facing the mirror.  The camera is either behind the students or to the side of them.  It is as though you are standing in the back of class.  Michele is heard in voice over.

Class details:  the class starts with standard modern dance warm-ups, head rolls, shoulder rolls, roll down and up; isolations; foot work-tendues, degages,rond de jambe, etc (ballet steps).  On the floor abs and stretches (some very unique stretches that you need to be flexible to do).

The music is very good: instrumental, percussion and vocal.

Michele says to start out slowly and work your way to doing the entire warm-up.  She goes from 1 step to the other and you will sweat.  This a good dvd to do before one of other broadway dance choreographed dvds as those don't have a warm-up.  Although I haven't yet found a choreographed dvd that I particularly like.  I have asked Michele to add some more beginner dance classes to her next series.  Most of the broadway dance dvds are for advanced dance students.  But there are a  lot of us out here who can't do aerobics  or step anymore, love to dance but are not real dancers.  Hopefully she will take me up on my suggestion. You can preview this dvd at liveatbroadwaydance web site.

Overall:  Love it, love it!!!!!! The price is a bit outrageous, IMO but it is what it is.",1186617600,11,1628,4.52233676975945
