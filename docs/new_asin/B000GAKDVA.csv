This wonderful made for television movie has long been out of print. The quality of this DVD version is very disappointing. It seems it has been made from an old video copy. The color is poor and the video seems out of focus at times. This could not have been mastered from an original source. Too bad as this is a great movie.",1195430400,5,476,6.014705882352941
