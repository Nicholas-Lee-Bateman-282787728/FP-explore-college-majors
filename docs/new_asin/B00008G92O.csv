7983811,1,B00008G92O,"This references the 1970s ""Car Wash"" in its location and musical background.  However, this may prove how films have gone downhill, rather than better since the 1970s.
I wonder if the director of ""Gang of Roses"" made this.  This film is filled with female mid-riffs and braids down to sistas' waists.  Again, women are made to look good, but like any other valuable traits.  Like Judd Apatow films, this shows huge numbers of ordinary, if not ugly, men, yet all the women look like they belong on a catwalk.
Roger Ebert once said that Oscars voters love ensemble cast.  Of course, this film is not Oscar material.  However, I imagine that ensemble casts are more challenging to work with than regular ones.  This film does have age diversity and diversity in skin complexion.  I am pleased that so many people got to add a movie credit to their resume, but that's where the compliments stop.
The filmmakers should have had more microphones or should have hired actors who can enunciate.  This film's dialogue was just one long mumble.  The Spanish subtitles helped me to understand what was being said, but those who can't read Spanish would really be in trouble.
Bad acting, a lack of a plot, boring scenes: this whole film is a manual on what not to put to celluloid.
I think this film takes place in Dallas, and I do like when productions show that Black folk don't just live in NYC or LA.  Nevertheless, this was an awful, painful, yucky film that I wouldn't recommend to a blind hog.",1275264000,5,1488,4.619771863117871
