8269861,4,B0018JKX2W,"This is a review of Criminal Justice -  Series 1 only. I have just finished watching it on Prime Video (after watching Series 2 earlier in the day). The difference in these 2 mini-series are like night and day. I would gladly watch this one again. The storyline - the cast was so good. It moved quickly through each episode. My only negative comment is the Judge telling the defense they needed not only to find evidence that they client didn't do it as well as discovering who did. (This is not the defense's job.) So if you haven't watched either mini-series, I suggest watch 1 first! They don't relate to each other so if you decide to watch 2 first, you won't have missed anything - except the wasted hours of watching it. (IMO)",1499299200,,732,4.4222222222222225

8269864,4,B0018JKX2W,"London 2007. Young man from decent lower middle class family, without priors, goes on a Saturday night spree. He 'borrows' his father's taxi cab, meets charming young woman with a nutty streak, the two hit it off, tequila, drugs, some weird games, some hasty sex...
It ends badly for the girl, and nearly as badly for the boy. He gets arrested for murder, he gets jailed, mistreated by his own lawyers and by the other inmates... The story stretches out for 5 hours and is quite well made. No spoilers.
Why not 5 stars? Well, the young man is a bit hard on your nerves. No guts, no will power, no character. Hard to sympathize with him.",1384128000,,636,4.444444444444445

8269866,5,B0018JKX2W,"This 5-hour BBC TV miniseries was so riveting that I watched the whole thing in two evenings. It's the story of a young man (played by Ben Whishaw), who through a cruel twist of fate is accused, tried, and convicted of rape and murder. Most of the screen time is devoted to a very detailed account of the man's life in jail and court during the trial.
  The main reason I loved the series is that Ben Whishaw is an incredibly good actor. He begins the story as a happy and charismatic post-adolescent. As he is dragged through the meat grinder of the criminal justice system and is abused in jail by both inmates and corrupt guards, you can see his soul slowly dying from the agonizing ordeal. Many of the prosecutors and defense attorneys are seen to be utterly callous. To them a trial is just a competition between two teams, and they care not at all that the defendant is fighting for his life. At the end of the series, the camera zooms in on Ben's eyes, and they are empty of life. It is deeply disturbing.
  This film is all the more disturbing when you realize that the justice system, whether it's in the USA or Great Britain, has ruined the lives of many people who were innocent or commtted only minor crimes.",1360281600,,1220,4.384955752212389
8269867,5,B0018JKX2W,"I've never had a movie, show, tv serious, or anything suck me in the way this one did! Being in the criminal justice field, I thought it was great to see things from the other side. They covered not on the court procedural process, but also the investigative, and what it is like in prison. I can't speak for UK prisons, but for American ones, it was disturbingly accurate. The violence, the having to choose sides just to survive, the prison politics that most will never truly see. So many youth end up incarcerated for what ever reasons, but it is not until they arrive to prison they become true criminals. This was a very emotional serious. They were able to capture the emotional strain on both families, the emotional attachment one may develope for a client, the internal struggle an attorney goes through to fight for justice, the prosecutors way of soley focusing on building a case against a suspect instead of actually exploring other possibilities (this is generally done even when there is not as much evidence as there was in this series). There was no ""fillers"" in this one. It was as if every single second was of substance and important. Even in hallway passings within 40 second conversations ""young white man gets off for killing black girl""... It brought to light what people don't see. Why some decisions are made not out of justice, but out of protecting ones political reputation. Hands down, the best series i've ever seen.",1354147200,3,1448,4.7272727272727275
8269868,5,B0018JKX2W,"This is a good deal grittier than the kind of British murder mystery that generally shows up on American public television.  The author,  Peter Moffat,  a former barrister,  wanted to give viewers a comprehensive look at the British criminal justice system and so covers police investigation, jail,  magistrates court,  prison,  trial and the aftermath.

  The writing is generally good,  although there are some plausibility issues at times.  A young man is accused of murdering a young woman he meets by chance,  which he denies,  with all of the evidence pointing to his guilt.  The story of his arrest,  remand in prison and trial are well done.  The Bar Council in England was harshly critical of the portrayal of the legal profession and  I would tend to agree with them.  It's hard to believe that lawyers typically advise their clients to invent stuff to suit the defense that the  lawyer wants to put on.

 The story can be tough viewing at times.  At various points,  you wonder  just how much physical and psychological trauma the scrawny 21 year old asthmatic protagonist can take.  And the ending seemed a little rushed.

 The acting is what makes this series really worth it.  Pete Postelthwaite,  Bill Paterson, Lindsay Duncan,  and Nicholas Farrell are especially good.  But Ben Whishaw,  who plays Ben Coulter,  the accused,  is superlative.  He won an international Emmy for this performance and recently made an acclaimed American Stage debut in the Off-Broadway production of ""The Pride.""  His ability to show all of the strong and conflicting emotions his character has to deal with is effortless.",1278720000,31,1618,4.992424242424242
