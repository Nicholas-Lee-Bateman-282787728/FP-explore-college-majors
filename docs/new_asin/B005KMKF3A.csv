4717971,3,B005KMKF3A,"Interesting to see a Korean war film from the British perspective. Not very realistic at all, but the dialog was good and saw a few young actors who became A listers later in their carreers. For the eclectic.",1388880000,,208,4.5
4717972,5,B005KMKF3A,"Yes, Michael Caine fought in the Korean War.  And that might have been part of the reason he was selected.

So it's a bit gritty and folks do stupid/crazy stuff.  That's part of war.  It brings out the best and worst in men.  And that's reflected here, too.  This is really one of the better movies about the Korean War.",1384128000,,320,4.25
4717973,4,B005KMKF3A,"What I enjoyed best about this film is the banter of the enlisted troops, much different from the Hollywood films of the same time.

If you are a war movie junkie it is worth watching although it will remind you of many others you have watched. Watch for the cultural differences not for the battle scenes.",1377388800,,306,4.464285714285714
4717974,4,B005KMKF3A,"This is a low budget, black and white, contemporary film about Great Britain in the Korean War.  Or rather a small group of British soldiers on patrol behind enemy lines in the Korean War,  It is a fairly conventional ""men at war"" story.  It's value lies in seeing the war from the British point of view.  We see so little of America in this war much less the others who fought there.  It is comparable to Samuel Fuller's ""The Steel Helmet"" in that it achieves a lot with very little.  And for fans of British actors of that era there is Stanley Baker, Harry Andrews (always great), a young Robert Shaw and you will not see a younger Michael Caine anywhere.",1376092800,10,657,4.3884297520661155
4717975,5,B005KMKF3A,"This gem from British filmmakers of the 1950's is a definite winner! The black and white photography is superb and adds enormously to the atmosphere and setting. The story concerns a patrol by a small British Army unit during the Korean War. The action is decent. The acting is wonderful, especially as many of these actors went on to brilliant careers, particularly Michael Caine in his first ever movie role, and Stanley Baker. I strongly recommend this film!",1371254400,3,461,4.923076923076923

4717979,4,B005KMKF3A,"1st time seeing this movie, and for an old B&W picture, is pretty good... Very accurate in it's portrayal and also was excited to learn that was the debut of future movie star Micheal Caine!

4717989,5,B005KMKF3A,"A Hill in Korea (released in the U.S. as Hell in Korea) is - on the surface - a standard Korean War plot. This 1956 film involves a British Army unit trapped in an abandoned temple on an isolated hilltop facing hordes of communist foes. How many times have we see that plot? To its credit, A Hill in Korea was one of the - if not THE - first Korean War movie to use it even though the same scenario was used in World War II movies such as Sahara a decade before.
  Beyond the main plot, the movie is a tribute to National Service men, draftees if you will, honourong their contributions to the then-recent war effort. The film splendidly depicts the differences (often leading to friction) between the National Service men amd the British Army regulars without making either group appear villainous or gormless. Even the commanding officer isn't an experienced regular, but commands the respect of his veteran NCO. In regard to the movie paying tribute to those everyday blokes who found themselves trapped on a hilltop a world away from the UK, A Hill in Korea succeeds admirably.
  The cast is a veritable smorgasbord of old school British actors. Viewers will instantly recognise Stanley Baker, Harry Andrews, Stephen Boyd, and Michael Caine (himself a Korean War veteran) as well as many other British character actors from countless other films. Possibly the biggest surprise for me was seeing a young George Baker as the C.O. (He later played the Emperor Tiberius in I, Claudius.) As one would expect from that stellar cast, the acting is superb and the potentially stereotyped characters well fleshed out.
  All and all, I would highly recommend A Hill in Korea for anyone interested in good war movies, the British Army, Korea, or just older British cinema with younger versions of many familiar faces.",1461369600,2,1810,4.785256410256411

4718005,4,B005KMKF3A,"Neat little low-budget war film with great cast that was a much  better film than I expected.  Excellent cast really boosts this simple little tale of group of English soldiers that are cut-off and outnumbered during Korean War.  George Baker, the always excellent Harry Andrews, Stanley Baker, Ronald Lewis, and Michael Medwin star with early appearances of Stephen Boyd, Robert Shaw, and a very young Michael Caine.  Director of Photography Freddie Francis (always dependable) and ace editor Peter Hunt give the film a much bigger budget look.  Worth checking out.",1445817600,,566,5.2444444444444445

4718008,5,B005KMKF3A,"Disclosure:  I give five stars to any movie/film/documentary about the the Korean War, the ""Forgotten Victory,"" (not my words, but those of General Colin Powell.)

It's not a really ""great film"", but nonetheless important,  if not for anything else than it's bringing together of so many British actors that would appear in so many movies that we would love in the second half of the  20th century,

Check out the cast:

Stanley Baker - who Americans may best remember him as  Lt. John Chard in the 1964 film ""Zulu.""
Harry Andrews - who most Americans over 30 (he was in one of the ""Batman"" movies, will definitely remember him as soon as they see his handsome mug,
George Baker - ""I, Claduis"" and main character in at least three James Bond movies and many more.
Stephen Boyd - ""Ben Hur"" and ""Fastic Voyage"" whoo died at age 22.
And, a little known aspiring actor by the name of Michael Caine, who served as a technical advisor, having actually fought in the Korean War, and appears for about two minutes in this movie.",1444176000,,1020,4.571428571428571

4718022,4,B005KMKF3A,"Great for the period and the genre--i.e., British War Films.",1424390400,,60,5.1
4718023,4,B005KMKF3A,"This film is a good little movie: little because of apparent low budget production distinctions. In this case low budget doesn't diminish its production value. Value of this film extends beyond its frequent battle scenes and male banter. For the screenplay is written well. Turn on close captions and read the dialogue and monologues. From that comes an offering of insight into concerns of common British soldiers. Besides that, the reading of British English, it being unlike American English, helps toward understanding British verbal idioms. Essentially using close captions allows richness of a well written screenplay to surface.

Situated in a hostile setting, British soldiers on patrol encounter enemy odds well passed the patrol's capability to deal with effectively. For comrades to survive others heroically step up to take greater risks of self. In this manner, holding together as a unit confronted by pursuing enemy aggression, the soldiers in numbers largely survive. Through this film comes many dramatized depictions of warfare illustrated by battle scenes. The whole of the dramatized hostile moments provide a setting in which men must individually confront his own mortality. In such lethally hostile settings there emerges a sense of fragility of one's own and other's mortality. This sense becomes an evident responsibility to a battle ground leader whose decisions for action mean the difference of life or death for men under his charge. Dramatic setting and situation is not lost amid the excitement of battle scenes.

A film such as this is the kind of war movies available for a kid growing up in the sixties. At that time, cinematic portrayal of war conveyed a sanitized, fantasized version of battle. From depicted, idealized hostile situations emerged a dramatic sense of noble aspects of self-sacrificing men. Illustrated as such led to a romanticized portrayal of lethal struggles between men in opposition. Romantic portrayal of lethal confrontation imbued impressionable minds with an individual sense of possibility. From such presumed possibility emerged playful imaginings of unselfish heroics played out on imagined battles of mayhem.

Films of this kind, of which this particular is one, represent chapters of a socially shared romance regarding warfare. Such romances are indicative of that bygone era, post WWII. However, at that time, anyone knowing a battle experienced veteran of WWII or Korean war might have noticed his unwillingness to share recalled traumatizing events of his war experience. Likely he'd regard himself a lucky survivor. Subsequently with life now his to enjoy came a life long burden weighting within him both mentally and emotionally. Common to many were nagging, burdensome thoughts and questions plaguing his mind as to why did he survive while so many others near him did not. Fortunately for most of these battle veterans would come an eventual sense of reconciling peace.

Sobering as these thoughts are, while viewing this movie and others of its kind, might out of necessity these thoughts be kept somewhere present in an entertained viewer's mind for ready recall? Still were that to happen may also occur an elicited sense of enjoyment such as this movie and others of its kind produce. Perhaps viewing sanitized, romanticized versions of humans' lethal inhumanity played out destructively on other people serves to satisfy some shadowy need within psyches of entertained audiences. Such a sobering thought as that is welcomes intelligent investigation. Outside those thoughts, nonetheless, comes the entertained sense war movies of this kind provide for a wide audience. On the whole viewing this film will give a viewer reason to come away with something satisfying.",1420761600,,3745,5.374787052810903

Not often does one see 4 Bren guns in action side by side holding the line, the usage of small arms is pretty cool with reloading used magazines, proper combat loads and automatic weapons that a heavy patrol like this would carry. Great view of P44 gear and equipment along with 1950 period Commonwealth summer field uniforms. Sneaky nature and mindless patterns of communist forces is spot on.
