7466118,5,B016APJF86,"My daughter asked me to watch this movie so she could ask me questions about growing up during this time.
It was well done.",1464998400,,123,4.166666666666667
7466119,2,B016APJF86,"Sorry to say, the causes of this movement are largely silent today and women are more of what they always have been.  Followers.  Objects. Puppets in a man's world.  Sure, getting the vote was something, and then there was Rowe Vs. Wade, but there's so much that women do to sabotage their own progress that it is sad.  This film was just plain boring.",1463184000,,352,4.453125
7466120,3,B016APJF86,"I'm watching this on Netflix and not sure I can finish it. (I graduated from High School in1969.) This sees to be a movie about the women who formed the organizations surrounding the women's movement. Some of them seemed sort of clueless.before the movement too.  Also their marching  and protesting. I'm not too keen on big organizations or how they were formed..was expecting something more gritty and women off the street and a little more history and how women's rights have progressed and what we have gained. So far nothing much about woman having their own credit rating and ability to have a credit card in their own name. How this was very important for a woman getting divorced back in the day.
I know I fight it all the time now and in the past. Sexism still being somewhat ingrained in our culture. That and my husband grew up in a conservative ranching community..nuf said..LOL It's not living up to my expectations.",1463011200,,929,4.693251533742331
7466121,5,B016APJF86,"It is already hard enough to find documentaries and information on the women's movement, but this documentary surely makes up for it. I recommend this to all women and all men.",1462233600,4,176,4.709677419354839
7466122,5,B016APJF86,Covers an important era in US feminist movement. I have read and heard about the figures and their writing but never saw pictures of them and to see them now after 40 ears is also enlightening. Real women makes real change,1461283200,4,222,4.439024390243903
7466123,5,B016APJF86,"An ""Old Hippie"" must see about those great times.",1461110400,3,49,4.555555555555555
7466124,5,B016APJF86,"A fascinating look back at the angry women who did something beautiful about the injustices that held them back. It isn't hyperbole to acknowledge that these feminists changed the world, it's a fact. A must see for women born after this era and a wake up call for all women. Progress toward gender equality is sadly a ripe subject for a historical documentary, but not the reality today. I saw this film with 250 women at a women's club who took the roller coaster ride along with the subjects of the documentary, laughing, crying and pining for a time when social movements improved the lives of millions.",1455494400,8,606,4.672897196261682
7466125,5,B016APJF86,I saw this film at a special screening last year.  I loved it!  It was informative and surprisingly funny at times.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning about our Second Wave Feminist foremothers. I have such respect for these women!,1455235200,7,250,5.048780487804878
7466126,5,B016APJF86,"Brilliant vdeo - should be required viewing for all young people - especially women, who need to know their history.",1480982400,,116,4.85
7466127,5,B016APJF86,What a beautifully powerful documentary. The women in this film are truly inspiring. As a 28 year old female I couldn't help but feel compelled to insert myself into the feminist movement somehow. It's truly my generations turn to carve out a little more space in history for women's rights.,1480550400,,291,4.84
7466128,5,B016APJF86,Great to have the history lesson and to hear from these inspirational ladies. It also includes current issues and interviews and the end really brought it all together for me.,1479427200,,175,4.866666666666666
7466129,5,B016APJF86,"An inspiring, poignant, witty, nostalgic and exciting look back at the women's movement, going back to the early 60's.  Highly recommended!",1478649600,,139,5.619047619047619
7466130,5,B016APJF86,"Very informative ,well made.  It take you through the walk. You do not have to be in full belief of the Women's movement, but you will know that some of this needed to happen. I was younger when this all started so it very much gave me a look inside of that time of what I missed. It is History!",1475625600,,295,3.9166666666666665
7466131,5,B016APJF86,"Brilliant history of Feminism , covering both Radical Feminism , seeking real change in the status quo , and Feminism Lite led by Women in Hats who sought a lighter sort of feminism with an Established and Beautiful Leadership Structure suitable for a Glossy Mass Market Magazine cover.  Highly recommended , very entertaining and  historically accurate.",1475107200,,354,5.303571428571429
7466132,5,B016APJF86,This wonderful documentary was enjoyed by 3 generations of women: one who lived the movement and two who have benefitted by it. It is very good and we highly recommend it.,1472342400,,171,4.548387096774194
7466133,4,B016APJF86,"I was one of the hundreds of part-time after work women's liberation feminist era organizers (of speak-outs, conferences, rallies, newsletters, women's center efforts) and was heartened by the photographs, film clips and interviews that showed groups of women working together throughout the film as those best depict the momentum of the times. I disagree with one of the last statements that radicals were all so necessary for the changes we were able to accomplish. Radicals as we generally think about them might  talk and write and sometimes teach at universities and these days tweet and FB post. Instead most of the ""radicals"" Ms. Ceballos refers to for the Miss America demonstration were just middle road  young women participating in protests many young people did at the time. However, it was hundreds and thousands of women in the middle who stepped up and out to make REAL change happen back then and in recent years, the same women responsible for the upcoming very possible election of the first woman president of the United States. Also many if not most of us were aware of the efforts of early feminists as most women's liberation anthologies included essays about them.",1467763200,4,1187,5.020304568527918
7466134,5,B016APJF86,"I thought this was an absolutely amazing documentary on the roots of the liberation of women. As someone who has thankfully grown up in a time and place where I have been able to take the majority of women's rights for granted, it hasn't escaped my attention that there's an alarming trend on a national level that clearly seeks to repeal these advances and turn back time. I feel both pity and shame for any woman in the western world who doesn't feel she owes a debt of gratitude to the pioneers depicted in this movie - I know my hat's off to these ladies!",1467072000,,559,4.333333333333333
7466135,5,B016APJF86,"Excellent documentary. The editing, the music, the archival footage, the contemporary interviews -- all combine to give a great portrait of the world-changing women's movement of the 1960s and '70s. Highly recommended!",1466726400,,218,5.84375
8736103,5,B016APJF86,"A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE
informative, accurate, well told",1529625600,,56,5.333333333333333
8736104,5,B016APJF86,"EVERYONE should see this. I learn something new every time I watch it. My 80 year old, conservatively reared father even watched it with my mom and sister and me. He was stunned. I think he felt really bad for not knowing how what his three daughters had gone through all their young years, and still witness and endure today. We had the most incredible conversation after watching it, and I will treasure that memory forever! His poor coffee shop mates. They got quite an education the next few days, too. Good for him!",1522713600,,520,4.542553191489362
8736105,5,B016APJF86,"Excellent historical perspective on how the women's movement unfolded.  I knew some of the info generally but not that the FBI director, Hoover, had women infiltrate women's consciousness groups to report to AGENTS what happened in those groups.  Paranoia within the govt. has not gone away today and this film is very relevant to the attacks on women and our culture today.",1517443200,,374,5.016129032258065
8736106,5,B016APJF86,MUST WATCH FOR FEMINISTS NON-FEMINISTS ALIKE,1510963200,,44,6.5
8736107,5,B016APJF86,"Great docu about ""womens lib"" era and onward with a lot of really great discussion from the women who lived it. Very valuable for touching on resistance within the new left to feminsim, and also contains some black female perspectives on the lack of inclusivity in the early feminist movement (hell, even the current movement) and their unique struggles in the context of the wider civil rights movement. Coincidentally has a great soundtrack.",1495152000,,443,5.082191780821918
8736108,5,B016APJF86,"My husband and I have watched this documentary several times.  After seeing it, I just had to have my own copy. I wanted my daughters to watch it and see how this generation paved the way for them to have the opportunities the have today.  This is a great documentary of the women's movement in the 60's and 70's.  The time I grew up.  It really takes you back to that time.",1494288000,,374,4.152777777777778
8736109,5,B016APJF86,Eloquent portrayal of feminist history. Particularly relevant to today's women who stepped out in the Women's March On Washington. Guide to CHANGE,1488499200,,146,5.681818181818182
8736110,5,B016APJF86,Awesome incredible film! Should be required viewing for ALL females in America!!!!,1484784000,,82,5.916666666666667
8736111,4,B016APJF86,"Brings back memories of an exciting, fruitful time. Wish I had that energy now when our efforts are so sorely needed.",1482883200,,117,4.619047619047619
8736112,5,B016APJF86,excellent movie on feminism from an intersectional lens.,1482019200,,56,6.125
