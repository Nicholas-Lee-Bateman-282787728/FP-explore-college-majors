3748327,1,B001PM1G4G,"Benji Lopez has been a sort of pioneer in contemporary Puerto Rican cinema, albeit in a cheap-production way. His ""Tainos"" approached the subject of historical and cultural roots in an innovative way; then again, the premise was preposterous. ""Mi verano con Amanda,"" besides suffering from countless defects, also affords Mr. Lopez the opportunity to indulge his passion for substandard, amateur music performed by talentless musicians of whom Mr. Lopez himself is a promoter. Although the technical aspects of the film are adequate, the acting is incredibly bad and the characterization is even worse. The characters are goal-challenged young men and women whose language is unnecessarily foul. None of the characters in this ant-hill epic is inspiring or inspired. They live for partying, boozing and smoking pot, and trying to jump in bed with anything. In its core it is a hideously mysogynistic film where the women are all social climbers, drunks or tramps, or combinations thereof. The character of Chicho could have been a great source of comic relief, had his dialogue not ruined it all. Rey Pascual, a Puerto Rican producer and actor of mostly tawdry crime dramas, has a role as a pothead pimp whose guiding vital principle is that women are only valuable insofar as they can pleasure men, and can only be subjugated if after male-dominated sex the male partner defecates in her bed, then leaves. A few minutes after receiving such enlightening advice, the male lead does exactly that to the woman after whom he has lusted throughout the film, the obsession that gives the film its title. John Waters was over-the-top at a time when over-the-top was innovative, challenging of bourgeois value and revolutionary. Benji Lopez is just crude in a pubescent caveman way. What a faux-celluloid atrocity without a cause! If that film is an accurate depiction of Puerto Rican youth today, it's no surprise the island is in such a mess! Compare this movie with ""Mal de Amores,"" another contemporary Puerto Rican film, and you will see the difference between trying to make a cinematic statement with few resources and wasting film on unwatchable trash. Unless you are shallow, 13 or acting 13 and high, you will most likely not enjoy this bottom-of-the-barrel mess.",1267660800,,2266,5.094086021505376

3748329,5,B001PM1G4G,"This movie at first sight could look like ""another teen movie"" but as the movie starts unveiling you can see is not. It is has the usual plot where the shy guy wants the unreachable girl but the ending goes to a different conclusion. It is a very fun movie to watch. The main actor seems to me a pretty talented guy who has potential to do more comedies like this. It is a low budget feature but very well don technically. Very well directed and cut. It is not the usual type of movie we use to see from Puerto Rico that generally produces a lot of sad dramas and soap operas. It has certain moments when the scenes don't get anywhere but I found the ending so original that I have to say it makes you forget any flaws it may have. I recommend this movie if you want to see a fun and crazy flick to entertain yourself. Highly recommended...",1233619200,,840,4.159509202453988
