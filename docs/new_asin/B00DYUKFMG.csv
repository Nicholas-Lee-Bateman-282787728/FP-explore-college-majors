5879684,3,B00DYUKFMG,"I'd like to start by saying I'm only 3 weeks into this program and I will update my review after I complete the 12 week program. If you follow this workout plan & eat healthy, you will of course lose weight and get in shape. This is true with ANY exercise DVD/system/program. I ordered this set because I have a diastasis recti and umbilical hernia resulting presumably from 3 back to back pregnancies. I want to do the proper exercises to repair this abdominal damage without causing further harm, before continuing on with a program such as T25 (which I highly recommend.) I have to say, the presentation of these exercise videos is lacking. The music sucks, it's awful. And unless you have the ""routine"" memorized, it's hard to follow. There's 15 second breaks between each set of exercise, but since you don't know what's coming next you feel rushed to catch up because she starts in on something new....and usually requires to switch to a resistance band, or get down on the ground for push-ups, etc. If you've ever followed a very well put together video such as P90X, T25, or any other Beach Body DVD, you'd know the difference. It's upbeat, energetic music, and the trainer is energetic, encouraging, and super easy to follow along as they have continuous verbal cues. Overall, I'm sure this MuTu System will give me results...but I can't say I'm enjoying the process.",1386288000,38,1376,4.7375
5879685,5,B00DYUKFMG,"This program works. It's gentle on the body and effective. I have had 3 babies and just recently found out about diastasis recti and discovered that I have it. I am seeing it begin to close while doing these exercises. And I am finally losing the mommy tummy! I also love the facebook group you get to be a part of. So inspiring to see everyone's before and after pictures. Best of all, they are real. No photo shopping.",1386115200,17,420,4.329113924050633
5879686,5,B00DYUKFMG,"I am completely amazed by MuTu. It makes sense. The program gives you functional workouts that are designed to help a woman's body, especially after birth. But, honestly, you don't have to have had a baby, or be a woman, in order to get great results from this program. The information is scientifically based. The founder, Wendy Powell, is brilliant, extremely patient and beyond supportive. Most people would charge an arm and a leg for the services she provides, but I find the prices quite reasonable and the results even better. MuTu addresses multiple issues of the body that are all inter connected. Wendy presents this simply and provides other avenues for further in depth research.",1379980800,5,691,4.9655172413793105
5879687,5,B00DYUKFMG,"As a new mom that's never thought much about fitness before, I was pretty stunned by my post-partum figure. The twenty extra pounds of last-trimester ice cream and the pregnant-looking belly would not budge, and I panicked and bought all kinds of products to fix it. Here's what I bought, so you don't have to: 1) Mamalates -has a good self-check for Diastasis Recti, but once I realized I had it, was told by the DVD itself I shouldn't use over half the exercises within. 2) Squeem Magical Lingerie Waist Shaper -bought this nice corset to wear 12 hours a day to knit myself back together. I'm not upset I spent the money on it because I look nice under clothes, BUT do a quick google search yourself to find out why long term corseting or splinting for daily use will trick your abs into being even lazier. 3) (Still with me? I told you I panicked) Lindsey Brin's Core Firing Sequence- has fabulous reviews and briefly discusses Diastasis BUT then you see her doing crunches so there goes the whole DVD--I'm not sure which are safe for me and which aren't. 4) BounceBack Fast! --Helene Byrne clearly knows her stuff and I like this DVD for her detail about form, with a special section for abdominal seperation (finally). However, its not formatted to be viewed daily with limited time..and guess what? You kind of have to do something daily to actually get results.. 5) I buckled down and bought this MuTu System (on the website-so nice to see it on Amazon!). Yes, it is expensive, but did you add up my #1-4? This program is as close to actually having a personal  trainer in your home everyday, which in my area is around $100/hour. It's professional-looking, fun and above all, MOTIVATING. Wendy Powell is a genius. Its embarassing, but her sincere introduction actually had me in tears. Its a lifestyle-changing, holistic program NOT another fitness DVD. It requires a daily walk and a few pieces of workout equipment including resistance bands, small dumbells and a yoga block (all explained inside). I'm 12 weeks postpartum starting Week 5. Though I still look pregnant and am now carrying 15 lbs of last-trimester ice cream, my Diastasis recti is down 2.5 fingers! It's been well worth the investment already.",1379980800,145,2219,4.7338501291989665
5879688,5,B00DYUKFMG,I'm a mom of 3 and have continuously struggled with getting my body back after child birth. Come to find out I had a 2-3 finger width DR thst was keeping me from getting the flat stomache I wanted. This program is designed for woman who have had babies and who struggle with the various things pregnancy can do to your body. It helps you build a strong core in a way that will help heal your transverse abdominals & get your body to a place where you can feel better about yourself (MuTu mama's call it getting your mojo back). I'm only 3 weeks in so I haven't seen big results yet but I can feel a difference in my body & I have become more aware of my core muscles & how alignment & posture affect those muscles. The things Wendy talks about make sense so I have already suggested this program to others. In 9 weeks I'll update this review and share my success!,1379980800,15,863,4.173652694610778
5879689,5,B00DYUKFMG,"I recently gave birth to my third baby, who was a whooping 11 lbs 5 oz. Needless to say, my core and pelvic muscles were shot. I had a diastatis recti gap of over 5 fingers width. This program has really helped me to not only close the gap, but also improve my alignment, my diet, and my self confidence. The core workouts and short and effective and easy to do even with kids running around. The intensive workouts are also super mom friendly; my kids even like doing them with me.
I am also a massive fan of the online support group; it is a wonderful group of women from diversify backgrounds with a common goal of being their best selves for themselves and their families. I really can't say enough about it.
I also love that i finally have an understanding of the science and mechanics of my core muscles, my alignment, and my diet and how they all work together.",1379980800,22,868,4.331288343558282
5879690,3,B00DYUKFMG,"I am a very active person and love that this program is specifically designed to not hurt people with diastasis recti. I completed the 12-week exercise program. I did not adhere to the strict food guidelines because I believe dieting and restricting ALL of specific types of foods and beverages is rather difficult and puts pressure and guilt on the person restricting. Mutu was great at helping me with lower morning back pain and also closed my gap a lot, but I still have some DR and back pain after completing the program. I will purchase the app to continue with workouts because I trust Wendy's team. So, in sum, for me, the Mutu DVD system was a start, but I will still need surgery to fix my muscles, umbilical hernia and get rid of the loose skin from my tummy. There isn't anything that Mutu can do to get rid of excess skin from being slender and having 3 over 9lb. babies. I'm giving it three stars because I felt a little mislead that if I completed the program, I'd have a much flatter stomach again. Even though the muscles were healed a bit, there isn't much that Mutu can do about loose skin. To be honest, my stomach looks the same after 12 weeks than when I started, but again, this program did help heal some of my DR. Good luck with your journey mamas!",1425254400,21,1273,4.375527426160337
5879691,4,B00DYUKFMG,"A mom has to buy a lot of gear to perform the exercises for the MuTu 12 week program: 12'' resistance loop, resistance band, 10'' pilates ball, swiss ball, medicine ball, 4'' foam block, foam half roller, kettle ball, 3lb or 5lb or 8lb weights and more. These items are randomly needed for warm-up, intensive workout and stretches. Or one can get creative and use substitutes.",1424563200,104,376,4.712121212121212
5879692,5,B00DYUKFMG,I love this program,1420416000,2,19,4.0
5879693,5,B00DYUKFMG,"She does a great job at progressing the moms.  Information on being a mom, exercise, and nutrition is all very good.
I enjoyed gifting this to my daughter.  I would recommend this to moms and seniors.
 I would like to see more chest expansion work and upper back stretches.  Maybe holding all stretches longer, 30 seconds for sure and encourage the breath a little more.  :)  All good!
Thank you!",1420329600,9,396,4.585714285714285
5879694,2,B00DYUKFMG,"After careful reading I realized that she is a restorative exercise specialist with the concepts similar to katy bowman. I feel like the PRICE IS TOO HIGH for something that is not ""unique"". There are a lot of squats and lunges, some bridge positions. The bottom line it is not anything new. Also the diet part, is nothing mind blowing. Just the regular stuff--watch fat intake, increase water, vegetables etc.  If you go on her website she does not even respond back to the people who are disappointed with her program. The best bet is to go to your nearest physio office and get a consultation. I personally found losing the fat slowly strengthening the abs and working on your lower body to be the best. But if you are in pain goto a doctor maybe a medical procedure is needed.",1418688000,25,780,4.531914893617022
5879695,4,B00DYUKFMG,"I got this after about 5 months after I delivered my babies and am at the beginning of the program. I like the program so far, and am excited about the effect. Each exercise is not too long, which is helpful when you have your hands full with little ones.",1416009600,8,255,4.12
5879696,5,B00DYUKFMG,"My ""gap"" went from 4 fingers length to 2.5 in just a week. I have been doing the program for almost 2 weeks and I love it. So far, I've lost 2 pounds!",1414540800,14,150,3.5757575757575757
5879697,4,B00DYUKFMG,Good program,1413590400,2,12,5.5
5879698,5,B00DYUKFMG,"I'm not a veteran of he program.  But I do have this to offer, I was working out hard but the tummy was not budging with other workouts.  I was very near my prepregancy weight but was being asked if I was pregnant frequently.  In the evenings if I got gassy, I looked 6 mo pregnant.  Also, after baby 3 I just felt a pressure and a bulge that seemed different.  Finally after someone mentioned this program I went and did the self check to see if I had diastasis and boy did I;  4 fingers!  Now I know why I didn't feel good after my workouts.  I had no core stability and was just pushing my guts out of my compromised abdomen with all those planks and crunches (yes my guts fell out of the opening during planks and I mistakenly thought I should just keep doing more of them).

 I am holding myself differently after only a few MuTu workouts.  I'm a fan.  Can't wait to progress with this program!
Update: Three weeks in and a 2"" loss at my waist without weight loss and two fingers diastisis down from 4.

I don't have a problem with the production of this video.  Its possible my version is updated and previous posters are talking about her first production.  In any case, I love how the exercises are segmented.  If you want to do them all together and get your exercise out of the way, fine.  But if you are nursing babies and putting babies down for nap and getting snacks and.... you know how it goes, then segmenting the exercises to do throughout the day is ideal for a mother of young children.

Also FYI, as of my writing this the DVD's will be out of stock for quite some time, so sign up for the on-line program!  Its a life long membership, free updates and access to the FB online support group.",1402185600,49,1712,4.228395061728395
5879699,5,B00DYUKFMG,"Just started this program.  I will update feedback when done with my first 12 weeks!  I really like their  philosophy of self care and nutrition--in addition to their main focus on building the core muscles for mothers!  I love their website and customer service is friendly.  I'm also glad the nutrition recommendations within the program are items I can find at the local grocery store.  Also, they offer alternative suggestions for exercise equipment by suggesting use of every day household items for exercise equipment if you don't have suggested equipment on hand.

Update:  This program really does help, but you do have to follow it.  The online support is very good.",1388707200,23,675,5.009009009009009
8599253,2,B00DYUKFMG,"I was really expecting more in the way of anatomical explanations, specific exercises and focused core workouts (like I would get from my physical therapist). The advert promised 'research based' exercise, but this research is never mentioned, cited or documented, as far as I could tell.  I don't really want or need a whole lifestyle or exercise regime (it's fine already, thanks), I just want to know what I need to do to make my diastatsis recti better.  Also, who doesn't know to eat whole foods and vegetables and good protein in 2017?  Why assume that we aren't doing that in the first place? Ditto the section on heels vs. barefoot shoes (who actually wears heels with a little baby. Seriously?) The core workouts are really just the same exercises slightly modified every two weeks and the HIIT are so 'downbeat' it's almost impossible to follow along without falling asleep. I wish I'd saved my money, and that there was a more informative and focused program out there (is there?)",1497830400,,991,4.817647058823529

8599261,2,B00DYUKFMG,"I purchased this system after having my second set of twins to help repair my diastasis recti. I work out regularly but was under the impression that this system would help to repair it. Overall it is nothing special and I saw no improvement in my diastasis recti. Essentially you are getting 2 DVDs with a total of 5ish workouts. (I say -ish because 2 of those workouts are like 5 minutes). The workouts are nothing out of the ordinary: squats, lunges, and dips and the food suggestions are really common sense stuff, like eat more veggies. I found better information and workouts on You Tube for free. Maybe the online system is better (I purchased the DVDs from Amazon), but for the price I would look up exercises on a search engine and buy a Jillian Michaels DVD for much less.",1439596800,26,782,4.514084507042254
8599262,2,B00DYUKFMG,"This is a tough one to give stars on. I think the exercise program is a good one. I just don't think the DVD version is marketed properly. I joined the Facebook group for purchasers while waiting for this to arrive and discovered there is a wealth of information available with the digital version (only available on MuTu's site). By the time it arrived I regretted buying the DVD version and never even opened it. I am returning it. The DVD version actually costs more than the digital version, so I will probably do that instead. If you email them, they will send you any document you request, but you have to know what you want and then wait for it. If you buy this, and don't join the Facebook group, you won't have any idea you are missing out.

They do state that buying the DVD version doesn't give you access to the digital version, but doesn't make it clear that the digital version has many supporting documents. They should just have a document only online area for people who buy the DVD version. Or since it costs more anyway, just allow access to the digital version anyway.",1438819200,34,1088,4.467336683417085
