8109526,4,B000EGFVL8,"Hey, what can I say -- I wish they would make more movies about tennis.

I completely agree with the deftly played and very relaxed, stoner ex-pro in this shaggy dog tennis buddy film:  ""Tennis is the joyous expression of life.""

He's right.  This is an affable, not-trying-too-hard look at struggling actors and industry types in Hollywoood that is centered around the celebrity-tennis circuit.  It's funny, cute, wry, and light -- if you are looking for Citizen Kane, look elsewhere.

But there are several very funny scenes, and the stars/writers are delightful and very enjoyable in a low-key, sad-sack manner.

Particularly recommended for tennis fans.",1200614400,,657,5.2
8109527,4,B000EGFVL8,"I learned of ""Tennis Anyone?"" from some of my tennis buddies. I wasn't expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

A lot of what it must be like for some to deal with the mega egos of Hollywood, and tennis players will appreciate the actual tennis talent of the stars.

I loved it. My wife thought it was mildly entertaining, so there you go.",1175817600,2,352,4.4

There are a lot of good tennis scenes but this is more than a tennis movie.  This movie is about two friends(one actor actor played by Donal Logue and the other one Tennis instructor who teaches Hollywood producers and directors played by Kirk Fox), their lives and figuring out themselves and lives.  Donal Logue did great job both writing and acting in this independent small budget film.  Just because of this movie is independent film, actors in this film were not holding back, and that makes this movie very funny and unique in many levels.  Donal Logue has not had major break through with major studio film just yet, but he seems enjoy doing his own things by incorporating his talents (writing and acting) into independent films where he seems comfortable and successful.  I really like the film.  It seems very real (as plot, deep develpment of characters) and has a heart.  It got me thinking that ""is it based on Donal Logue and Kirk Fox's real life??""  After all, I totaly saw that his tennis skills were improved through the film.  Finally, Donal Logue is quite a good tennis player! It is coming from me, a tennis instructor,. ;)
For the conclusion, I later found out that Donal Logue and Kirk Fox actually met on the shooting of Mel Gibson's epic film Patriots from special features of this DVD.  So this turned out be based on real friendship among them.  ""Cool!!!""",1164585600,2,1486,4.622137404580153
8109529,3,B000EGFVL8,"I enjoyed this movie because I generally like ""artsy"" movies that are critically acclaimed, which we all know generally translates to ""most people think it sucks"".  I watched this movie because I'm a huge tennis fan.  It's not a tennis movie per se, but the story of finding yourself in life revolves around tennis in this movie.  It was entertaining and worth the rent, although I wouldn't necessarily buy it.",1157846400,2,410,4.828571428571428
