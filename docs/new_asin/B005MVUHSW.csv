4838144,5,B005MVUHSW,I have never bought a Seasun DVD before and her moves are very challenging. After a couple weeks I am still at the 15 min mark on this DVD because it takes awhile to figure out the moves but I actually enjoy that aspect. I didn't want a DVD that was easy and boring. Seasun is a great instructor because she isn't one of those fake smile 'rah rah rah' exercise instructors. Instead she is very 'real' and just gets right down to business. I highly recommend this to those that are looking for a challenge.,1372896000,5,505,4.270833333333333
4838145,5,B005MVUHSW,"As a home exerciser who does step 3 times a week, I enjoy steady-state workouts with fairly advanced choreography (so that they don't get boring when you do the same routine repeatedly). It will likely take you a few times with some rewinding/ replaying the trickier moves to get this one down, but once you do it's great fun and excellent cardio. You might want to purchase Seasun's ""Straight Up Step"" DVD first to get accustomed to her style (I was already doing that one and ""Stepping Up"" before I bought this DVD); I would say it is the least difficult from a choreography standpoint among the 3 I own. I do wish the aerobic routine in ""Super Step"" was about 9-10 minutes longer for a full hour, but it's not a big deal since I just skip back and go through the last section where you go through the whole routine thrice again.",1370563200,16,831,4.402597402597403
4838146,5,B005MVUHSW,"I have been stepping for about 20 years and used to be an instructor. I love challenging, dance-based/freestyle step choreography.  This video is great. The choreography is challenging - I FINALLY got the entire routine down pat on my 5th or 6th attempt.  And now that I've got all the moves, I can really get into it and enjoy it.  A couple of pointers:

1.  Imagine you are looking in a mirror. This was my first time doing step via a DVD (all my favorite instructors have moved away, so I've been forced to try to find fun DVDs. I was confused at first by which way to go because I'm used to having the instructor's back to me, or at least having the instructor next to me rather than facing me.  If you imagine you are looking in a mirror, that helps you figure out what you are supposed to be doing and which foot should be leading.  Seasun also calls out which foot you are leading on-- I'm a verbal rather than visual learner, so that helped me a lot.  Her cue timing is excellent.

2. For the trickier steps, however, it would have been helpful if she included a breakdown section where her back is to you (i.e. for the sexy sixteen or the rock & roll), but with time, you'll get it. Just like going to a new class - you need to try it a few times to get the hang of it!

3. The cue terms are a bit different from what I'm used to.  For example, ""drag"" I know as ""cross behind.""  ""One two over"" I know as ""quick over.""  Once I adapted, it was no problem.

4. The sexy sixteen -- it would have been helpful if she verbally cued the footwork a little more, but I did figure it out --it's sort of an ""up, up, ball change, pivot, down down, step, cross behind(and repeat).""  Hope that helps!

Happy stepping!",1367798400,10,1712,4.1580547112462005
4838147,5,B005MVUHSW,"I do lots of step and have for years, so I get bored easily.  This workout is tough, gets me sweating - A LOT - and it is very interesting.  Seasun is a pretty good cuer, which makes her difficult choreography easier to get down.  Definitely don't purchase this if you are a beginner, but if you are experienced you will get your heart rate up, sweat like mad, and have a BLAST while doing this workout!  I will purchase more of her DVDs.",1365120000,3,438,4.178571428571429
4838148,4,B005MVUHSW,"I've done other step aerobics videos and had some experience with step aerobics in some classes, so I thought I'd give this a try. I read the reviews (currently there are only 3 others) and I figured it couldn't be THAT hard to figure out the moves. Well... for me, this is pretty tough! I think I should have started with an earlier DVD from Seasun Zieger, which is what I plan to do next. I think I will just get frustrated if I try to figure out all the moves without any base of knowledge from her other DVDs.

I think I will really like this workout DVD if I can learn some of her moves from other videos. I didn't realized ""advanced"" meant specifically ""Seasun Zieger moves!"" I really like the look of the video- all the women are wearing identical black outfits, which is easy to follow and less distracting than some other videos. I like her attitude and her voice.

So overall, I think this is a great workout- just not quite for me, yet. I definitely plan to return to it after learning a little more from her other DVDs.",1363564800,6,1031,4.282051282051282
4838149,4,B005MVUHSW,"A great workout, but definitely has some difficult choreography. I've mastered the first 20 minutes, but tend to get frustrated  trying to learn the new steps. Just be ready to set aside some time to learn the routines. You'll need the pause button since there's no section where she ""breaks down the steps.""",1362096000,,308,4.811320754716981
4838150,5,B005MVUHSW,"Seasun is the best!  I love her energy scale and her peppiness is just right.  Her choreography is very challenging.  She does break it down,  but I don't catch on quickly so I do have to rewind it A LOT.  That's okay.  It will have a great rewatchability. The core section is quick, only about 6 minutes or so.  I've only been stepping for about 6 months.  I like the challenge of the new and tough choreography.  It is good for the brain.  It is also a great distraction.  It makes the workout go by faster.",1357689600,3,509,4.197916666666667
4838151,5,B005MVUHSW,"If you are familiar with and enjoy Seasun Zieger's other step aerobics dvds (particularly Straight Up Step and Stepping Up), you will want to add this one to your collection.  If you have never tried one of her dvds, you may not want to start with this one.  (I started with Straight Up Step, but The Next Step might be a good one to start with as well.) This workout is fast-paced and includes some complicated footwork.  It took a while to master the steps, but it is worth it.  It is a tough but fun workout.  I have been doing Seasun's workouts for over a year and a half, and I have not gotten tired of them.",1348704000,3,613,4.161016949152542
4838212,5,B005MVUHSW,"This isn't for a beginner,  but its still really fun and will help you burn fat and get some muscle. I like it cause its challenging and keeps me intrested. I have to practice the sets a few times before I can get them and move on to the next one but hey that's what rewind button is for. The cast and instuctor are likeable and she ques you on time.",1407196800,,350,3.9295774647887325
4838213,1,B005MVUHSW,"this woman is very hard to follow, the steps are ridiculous, and she is not inspiring at all, very dissappointed",1402704000,,112,4.65
4838214,5,B005MVUHSW,Seasun's step routines are SOOO fun!!  I buy all her DVD's that I can. Hope she makes more. They are great!,1401321600,,107,4.095238095238095
4838215,1,B005MVUHSW,"I'm not a novice exerciser nor am I new to stepping, but I could not follow her cues.  I would love the pace and the moves if she had a separate section where she just showed the mechanics of the steps. I spend most of my time tripping over the step and just jumping around. She says, ""You'll have plenty of time to learn this"" throughout. Ha! I've had the DVD for at least 6 months and have only learned about the first 20 minutes....I try to work on one new step per session.",1400889600,,477,4.074468085106383
4838216,1,B005MVUHSW,It looks fun. She doesn't explain anything.  There isn't even a section where she breaks it down for you.  I don't have the time to learn it the way she expects you to.,1399939200,,168,4.0606060606060606
4838217,2,B005MVUHSW,"This DVD looks promising, but it will take many, many (and even more than those) attempts before anyone can learn the routine set by the instructor. Plan to set aside at least an hour per day for a while to finally get it. The different steps are not well demonstrated and are run through so quickly that you'll find yourself pausing and replaying sections of the workout and maybe even trying to catch them in slow motion more than actually exercising. A training portion is absolutely what this step DVD needs! Even if the instructor moved a bit more purposefully through the choreography to make sure her home audience could learn some of the routine THAT would have been a massive improvement. As it is, your frustration will likely mount, and if you stick with it at all, it will be because you're just too stubborn to say you wasted $12.
2 stars just because the workout is thorough and challenging. It would have gotten 4 or 5 if it had been more user friendly. :/",1394496000,,971,4.5227272727272725
4838218,1,B005MVUHSW,I do not like this video and wish I had not wasted my money. The transistions are executed poorly in the video.  It takes way to long to learn the routine.,1394409600,,155,4.0
4838219,2,B005MVUHSW,The tape was too fast and more like dance than step. There was no instruction just quick moves. Not recommended.,1390262400,2,112,4.65
4838220,4,B005MVUHSW,"I've been doing step for about 7 years and this dvd is HARD! The choreography is quite complicated. In fact, this is the only exercise dvd that I haven't been able to complete at the first go-round, but I appreciate the challenge. I pop it in every couple weeks and add a few minutes to what I'm able to figure out.",1383696000,2,315,4.180327868852459
4838221,3,B005MVUHSW,Moves are too complicated. It was taking too long to learn. Didnt keep going. Not very motivating either. Denise Austin is much better.,1374278400,,135,4.913043478260869
8479856,3,B005MVUHSW,"I really, really would like to rate this workout higher, but after trying to complete it ten times (at least) and still not being able to master the moves, I am giving it a three. I realize it is for advanced steppers, but I have been doing step workouts since the beginning, and I still can't get the moves down. The workout is a lot of fun, but she will introduce a move and say ""plenty of time to rehearse this"", and by the time she goes to the next combo I still haven't learned it. Some of the advanced moves are with your back to the screen as well, which makes it even more difficult to get the moves right. If you can get through it you will get a good workout. I'm going to keep at it until I get it down - even if it takes me years!",1519516800,,742,3.9205298013245033
8479857,5,B005MVUHSW,"I bought this after I learned of Seasun's passing. This is my first workout of hers and I loved it. I went into it in ""learning mode,"" as I'd previously heard that her choreography was challenging. I tried it the first day with no risers, only following the modifier and only planning to do the first two combos. Today, I added the third combo and was able to do all three, still following the modifier. It's a great workout and Seasun is clearly enjoying herself; her enthusiasm is infectious. I'm so sorry that she's gone, but glad I have this gem of hers.",1474416000,,558,4.427184466019417
8479858,5,B005MVUHSW,"Seasun is amazing and this DVD doesn't disappoint. Not for beginners as it's advanced Step, but the choreography is fun and challenging",1474070400,,135,5.181818181818182
8479859,5,B005MVUHSW,"I just got back into step aerobics after taking a break for a few years.  I worked my way through all of my old Seasun favorites and decided to tackle this one.  Seasun's work is for advanced steppers, so this isn't going to be a workout that you pick up and master immediately.  I love that aspect of her videos because it makes for great repeat viewing.  Seasun doesn't do a preview section for complex moves and I'm actually fine with that.  I find that when a move preview is provided, it is so isolated and out of context that when it is thrown at you quickly out of nowhere in a routine with zero breakdown and you still mess up - might as well just rewind!  That said, I go into her videos in ""learning mode"" where I just focus on mastering one combo at a time daily until I am able to get through the entire video.  This minimizes my frustration and feeling that I didn't get a real workout in - I just do a bit of the video as add-on cardio until I can make it a real workout!  This one took about a week for me to more or less master and a few weeks until I could do all the advanced modifications (holla ""Sexy Sixteen"").  Having done all of her videos and now being on the other side of this one, I feel like her teaching style here has actually gotten better considering the trickiness of some of the moves.

This workout is fun, one of Seasun's best (well, maybe a tie with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stepping-Up-With-Seausun-Zieger/dp/B0028J4WKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stepping Up With Seausun Zieger</a>).  The routine flows nicely and is challenging - you will be sweating buckets by the end where everything is tied together and then spliced.  Seasun has really come into her own as an instructor over the course of her video history and this one is no exception.  Compared to her very first CIA video where she seemed robotic and almost nervous, she's focused but engaging here and clearly having fun.  Her love for step choreography is evident and that's what makes her routines so great.

Other good things about this workout is that it is short and sweet - 60 minutes from warmup to stretch and that includes a pretty punishing core section.  It also has 3 good quick premixes which run from 30-40 minutes - this is great for me to get in a quick cardio session before work.

My criticisms are pretty minor here:

1) I don't love the music except for maybe two songs but I can obviously move past that.  Her last work had really great popular music so it was icing on the cake.

2) I think the intensity is ramped up a bit too quickly.  The warmup song is quite fast and you are doing a lot of jumping jacks and such at that speed.  I prefer a more gradual warmup instead of my HR going from 75 to 145 in 3 minutes.  The first combo is pretty intense as well (more intense than the 2nd IMO) so it feels like a lot of work initially rather than building up to the hardest part.

I wrote this review for a 5 year old video because I've mastered this workout and LOVE it.  I hope Seasun reads this and knows that steppers are still out there and we miss her presence on the scene.  Come back!  We're waiting!",1468195200,2,3178,4.443868739205527
8479860,4,B005MVUHSW,A bit advanced for me but I like the fact that you move constantly.,1450310400,,67,3.857142857142857

8479864,2,B005MVUHSW,I've been taking step including advanced step classes at my gym since the concept first started and I found this dvd to be poorly choreographed.  The moves are extremely hard to catch onto and the instructor doesn't break down the moves the way that she should.  I was very disappointed with this dvd.,1422489600,,301,4.660377358490566
8479865,5,B005MVUHSW,"I love this step routine.  I've been doing step off and on for almost 20 years and i love challenging routines in both intensity and moves.  It took me 3 attempts to finally get the moves.  The first time i made it to the 25 minute mark which was about 35+ actual minutes once you account for the number of rewinds i did.  The second time i made it to about the 35 minute mar[ I  had also watched parts of it just to see the footwork.  On my 3rd attempt i made it all way through. I was sweating buckets and felt quite accomplished for having made it to the end.

Don't get discouraged. Just take it in steps..one combo at a time.  The combos are challenging but once you get it..it is a lot of fun.",1421971200,,699,4.0144927536231885
