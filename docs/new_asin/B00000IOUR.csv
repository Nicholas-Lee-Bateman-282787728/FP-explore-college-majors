1226580,4,B00000IOUR,"A gem of a film. .  Hockney and his  former/partner are fine performing as themselves in this affectively rich examination of a love affair gone sour- unraveling into depression and madness.  Fine acting, good editing. A treat to the  eye and heart.",1259712000,3,249,4.857142857142857

This is one of those very rare docu-dramas that came out of the experimental 70s in the film making industry that really left the Movie World with a real Classic.  The director actually followed the artist and associates around for 31/2yrs, filming them.  They then took this and blended some fictional dramatic framework to create this Classic film.  It must be noted here that the explicit love scene in this film created total chaotic controversy whenever shown in its time!!  The artist was very surprised and somewhat shocked by the overall movie!  A  STORY  CAN  BE  LARGER  THAN  LIFE!!!",1215561600,,741,5.961904761904762
1226582,4,B00000IOUR,"Jack Hazan followed the artist David Hockney around from 1971 to 1973 filming this quasi-documentary about him. A very young and slim Mr. Hockney-- he would have been 34 I believe in 1971-- comes across as witty and interesting. Some parts of this 90 minute film are quite wonderful, particularly  where the artist talks about his art or when we actually see him painting. There are also fascinating scenes where the subjects of his paintings actually merge into their life-sized portraits as life imitates art. The footage of the swimming pools looks like the paintings that figure prominently in the movie, particularly ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)."" There is much made of the bright blue color that Mr. Hockey seems to be so fond of, complementing his work as well. Images are often repeated, giving the film a pleasing symmetry.

Not everything works so well, however. The director would have us believe that Mr. Hockney is having difficulty completing a painting because he has just broken up with its subject and his lover, Peter Schlesinger. The artist, who according to the accompanying notes to the DVD, was upset when he saw the finished documentary, indicated that the breakup was not a factor in his slow work on the painting. Also often the people just engage in dull conversation about not much in particular. Some of the dialogue could have been cut without hurting the finished film at all. Much is made about whether Mr. Hockey will return to California or to New York, et cetera, et cetera. One person repeats two or three times that ""when a love goes wrong, there are more than two people who suffer."" Okay. Then there is a rather explicit sex scene between two men that does not add much to the overall excellence of the movie.

This film will appeal most to hardcore fans, particularly the footage that gives a glimpse into Hockney's creative process. I came away from the movie agreeing with the extremely private novelist Eudora Welty, who believed passionately that one should concentrate on the work of the artist, rather than so much the details of his or her life.",1207526400,21,2109,4.820441988950276
1226583,2,B00000IOUR,"This movie is just awful.  I have read the other reviews here. All I can say is, if you appreciate Hockney's work, find a way to really look at it.

This certainly isn't it.  If you feel you just have to see this because you'll do anything ""Hockney"", do yourself a favor and rent the thing.",1168387200,4,290,4.142857142857143
1226584,5,B00000IOUR,"It is not true that the film made a horrible transfer to DVD.  The quality is wonderful, especially for a film that was made in the 70's.  In fact, I'd say it was a labor of love for whomever processed the original prints.  This is a film about David Hockney so there's no chase scene.  I can only speculate that since he is an artist, and artists are a little different from the rest of us, this film is a little different from what you might expect.  I think Peter Schlesinger is very pretty and I would like to have gotten to know him better but the film never peers into his personality, and I think that is intentional.  I find David Hockney much more attractive in that he is warm, funny, artfully clever, and human.  Whether you buy it or rent it, I think you'll get something out of it if you want to know something about David Hockney.",1157241600,12,844,4.2375
1226585,4,B00000IOUR,"Jack Hazan's quasi-documentary A BIGGER SPLASH is an unfocused examination about the creative life of David Hockney and supposedly about the effect of his past relationship with his pupil Peter Schlesinger (an artist, sculptor, and photographer who Hockney not only enjoyed as a lover but as a disciple). The pr&eacute;cis appears to be that Hockney, in the throes of disappointment about the dissolution of his affair with Peter, decides to move to California where he has already been established as a painter of California people and places.

In London we meet his friends - Celia Birtwell, the elegantly stylishly beautiful model Hockney used repeatedly, dress designer Ossie Clark, confidant Mo McDermott, and patron Henry Geldzahler - each of whom Hockney painted and drew. We watch as Hockney visits the galleries and admires works of his friends, how he paints in his studio, how he relates to his gallerists (like Paul Kasmin), and how he perceives men and other artists.

Peter Schlesinger figures prominently in the film with many episodes of Peter's swimming in the pools of the people Hockney would eventually immortalize. He is a fine presence and carries his silent role well - almost appearing as a ghost muse that keeps Hockney focused on his now infamous swimming pool paintings.

The magic of this film, for those to whom Hockney is a well known and important painter, is the visual recreation of the paintings that have made him so famous: we are allowed to see Celia and her husband with white cat in context with the canvas, the view of Peter staring into the pool at an under water swimmer, the woman and her animal heads who appears in another of Hockney's famous paintings at poolside, etc. This kind of cinematic background is valuable now and will prove invaluable to the archives of David Hockney. For those people this is a must-see film, despite its meandering technique and choppy editing. For others, it may seem too self-indulgent. Grady Harp, August 06",1154908800,10,1986,4.975903614457831
1226586,1,B00000IOUR,"David Hockney didn't like this movie. It was way too personal for Hockney (and too explicitly homosexual for the average heterosexual preference). He thought it was going to have a lot about his paintings and him talking about art. Instead it follows his failing relationship with his lover, Peter, who was a major inspiration of his paintings at that time.

15% of this film is about art. There's about 8 minutes collectively of Hockney in his studio and painting. One minute of him talking about what's on his mind with art. Six or so, 20 second scenes where they re-create some of his great paintings at that time; and a few scenes where he's being hounded about his production and selling his art. And what's most interesting to me is he was in the middle of painting ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)""- so you see a little of the process of how that painting came about.

Take away that 15%, what's left is a homosexual film that's poorly edited.",1153180800,11,964,4.598837209302325
1226587,1,B00000IOUR,"I ordered this DVD and anxiously awaited its arrival only to find a terribly boring and pseudo-intellectual collection of rubbish not worthy of my time.  And as another reviewer pointed out, the DVD transfer is abyssmal!  For those of you who want to determine for yourselves if this is a decent film, I suggest you try renting it before buying.  Believe me, you will be glad you did.  And those of you who are willing to learn from my mistake, try satisfying your thirst for knowledge of the life, aesthetic and circle of Hockney with a book or other source (I believe there are other films out there as well).  This particular work will leave you feeling robbed.",1148688000,17,664,4.593220338983051
1226588,3,B00000IOUR,"Whilst the movie is a fascinating period piece, prospective buyers should be aware that it is a non anamorphic transfer which is unforgivable for a new release DVD in 2006.",1147478400,6,172,4.766666666666667
1226589,4,B00000IOUR,"This movie is a visual delight. If the viewer can ignore the sometimes self indulgent retelling of Hockney's love life, he/she will be impressed with the true magnificence of his work. Also worth a view for a glimpse of Patrick Procktor's painting. This movie is a must-see if you're an admirer of Hockney's art: his life seems a manifestation of his art.",1146268800,9,355,4.741935483870968
1226650,2,B00000IOUR,It was fun for a bit to look at it as a period art piece...couldn't stick with it. Reminded me of Warhol films a little...,1454544000,,122,3.92
1226651,4,B00000IOUR,"Made in 1974 this is a sort of documentary about the art of Andy Warhol look a likie and Northern Enfant terrible  David Hockney. In it he is going through a bout of artist block where he cant get the inspiration to paint a picture of one of his muses properly.

He decides to do a swimming pool painting and this lays out the pains taking process that he goes through. We also have him tussling with the ideas of going on trips or to California because the light is better and his personal relationships. During this he often reimagines how he created certain of his paintings using real people from his life. Some of these are very interesting and shows a whole other side to Hockney. There is also a lot of nudity  male nudity and some could accuse this (for the time) of being deliberately provocative or indeed deliberately pretentious. Either way it works for the most part.

It will help if you are a fan of his work; the trouble with art is that it is very subjective  the old adage I know what I like when I see it. However, irrespective of taste there are objective signposts that indicate talent and for me one of those is the level of interest that a piece can engender. Hockney can manage to do that and he also comes across as being a very warm and personable person.

It does though show its age with some of the fashion on display being so oh dear that it can almost hurt your eyes all kaftans and nylon. There is a wonderful Miss World send up too that was one of the best scenes in this, but overall this held my interest for the most part but it really is not a film I would wish to see twice, so the rental option might be the best option.",1449446400,,1659,4.217665615141956

Videodrome had dialogue and a plot, albeit psychological science fiction. Fahrenheit 451 at least made an attempt at a plot and had dialogue which came to a believable climax.

Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I lost interest and kind of surfed ahead to see if the story line got any better which it didn't.  This movie about a gay artist, fashion shows and the characters really did nothing for me.  The nakedness in this movie didn't really add or take the movie to another level.  At least however the people used in those scenes had relatively decent bodies (which may be the only plus thing I found in this movie, even though I don't think these type of scenes benefit a well made movie).

1226757,4,B00000IOUR,"I came upon this film by accident; though I was a child of the '60s, David Hockney's work was not known to me. Being introduced to his art in this film was moving and revelatory. Hockney's work is highly accessible and having the subjects pose beside their painted selves was eerie. What struck me most was how perfectly the film captured that more innocent time, the early '70s. Repeated words, happenstance Eros, throwaway conversations, knockings on the same door . . . none of these elements of the film were to me extraneous. Rather, they evoked a time when time was taken to create a mood, a place -- much as did the works of the artist himself, then, and then.",1323475200,3,667,4.520661157024794

In viewing both films you will see how time changes him, from the young hormone, ego driven artist to a later reflective and sharing person. It is almost unbelievable the changes that occur in a person's life as reflected in these films. Very few artist have shared so much about their lives and art as does Hockney, most are reclusive or secretive especially about their process of creating.  Hockney is not only an innovative artist but also a scholar, teacher and great screen personality.",1300406400,7,667,4.842105263157895
