8142152,3,B000HXE5S8,"Video clip interviews and some race footage of Carrol Shelby, Phil Hill, Roy Salvadori, Dan Gurney and Bob Bondurant ranging from Nassau 1955 to Le Mans 1969. As all interviews are un-scripted and unrehearsed, none of these will merit any public speaking awards, but this DVD does seem to cover what ever film footage is available from that era. For those looking for quality photos and more detailed information, probably one of the Shelby biographies would be a better reference.",1397606400,,481,5.025
