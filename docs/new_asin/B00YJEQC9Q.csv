8718480,5,B00YJEQC9Q,"This is a gentle, sweet and caring interview with a very elderly but still quite deep and profound man who will always stand as an inspirational and central influence in the effort to increase unity, respect and kindness amongst all faith traditions.  I learned with this rabbi back in the 1980s, and will always remember him for blessing.  For me, finding this interview now is simply a splendid gift.",1447113600,,402,4.811594202898551
