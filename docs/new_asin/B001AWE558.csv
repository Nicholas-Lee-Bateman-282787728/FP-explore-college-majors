3472376,3,B001AWE558,"This is a film adaptation of Jaime Bayly's most notorious novel, directed by one of Latin America's most prestigious directors.  Unfortunately, the material itself is weak, dealing as it does with the spoiled lives of the Peruvian upper classes (Bayly is a Vargas Llosa wannabe).  As a result, the characters do not evoke either sympathy nor empathy--particularly the protagonist, played rather innefectively by Santiago Magill (I hated his long hair).  However, the premise happens to be culturally on target: in Per--as in most of Latin America-- it does not matter if you fool aside with men as long as you pass off as straight--meaning a wife, kids, and macho behavior. Thus, as a culture expos and critique, the film is right on target.",1243814400,6,741,5.008130081300813
