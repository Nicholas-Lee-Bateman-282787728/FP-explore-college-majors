8092686,1,B000BTQNNI,"To Tobias Allen and others like him that help promote and support these societal losers like John Wayne Gacy, etc and keep them in the lime light, there must be something wrong with you.  Yes YOU.  These people who suffer from psychopathy and sociopathy lust for the lime light.  WHY would you give this to them. Do you understand that these people are NOT worth anyones time.  Tobias, do you REALLY think the guy buying Elmer's painting and burning it is crazy.  YOUR the crazy one collecting the ashes from it.  I would have LOVED to have purchased ALL of those paintings and have had them destroyed. Unfortunately I couldn't live with myself having you, them and their families benefiting from money.

And to the filmmakers:

Shame on you.",1417392000,,742,4.6976744186046515

8092688,3,B000BTQNNI,"This was originally available on Youtube, and certain part shot at the ""Manson"" house are not present in this version, which I feel makes it incomplete. Otherwise it's a great look into a very touchy subject of american fascination.",1353801600,,232,4.9743589743589745
