8578610,5,B00C888KEU,"Marian Marzynski, a Jewish Holocaust survivor, a film maker from Poland living in US married to a Polish Catholic turns the camera on himself in order to make this documentary. When he was five years old, he was told in order to stay alive he needed to forget who he was. Seventy years later, Marian one of 28,000 Holocaust survivors returns to Poland to face his past and other Jewish Holocaust survivors.

Every Jew or none Jew should watch this documentary and hear the stories of Poland's Holocaust survivors' cries, fear and suffering that will take anyone back in time, so should anyone who forgets history and more importantly does not learn from history. This film should serve as a reminder to the citizens of planet earth that if history chooses to repeat itself, unlike 1940s, this time probably there would be no survivors left to tell any story.

A very painful, well done documentary about history that should have no place to repeat itself regardless of race, religion or region. Why US did not and has not delivered those missiles to Ukraine is beyond me. Bravo.",1395360000,7,1078,4.759358288770054
