movie is done on a movie set and is good to look at for a few minutes but get
bogged down real fast. Even the main actress is not in the movie all the time, its
mostly about the dumb cavemen and how another takes avantage of their stupidity.

1212253,1,B00000FE81,A lot less funny than the earlier movie about women with tails. The systematic exploitation and shortchanging of the cavemen wore thin in 40 minutes and was no longer funny.,1249776000,,173,4.8

1212255,5,B00000FE81,"This movie, or film, is a comedy about the dawn of civilized man - mainly cave men learning how to be civilized - and the creation of society. It is in the form of the old Greek comedies with funny but insightful dialogue and characters. This probably stems from the fact that it was made in Italy, which stems partly from Rome, which stems partly from Ancient Greece. It also has a touch of simple foolishness and campy style that may or may not be to your liking. To me anyway,
it is a timeless, low grade film that is worthy of cult classic status. However, it is probably too unknown to ever receive this attention.",1105401600,20,619,4.344827586206897
7908513,5,B00000FE81,"OK, so ""Quando le donne persero la coda"" (called ""When Women Lost Their Tales"" in English) has got to be one of the silliest movies that I've ever seen. But believe it or not, there is a mildly serious slant to the movie: an outsider comes in and basically introduces capitalism to the main cavemen. Go figure! But of course, the movie's main point is to show off Senta Berger and her physical aspects. You gotta admit, there would be lots to admire in a prehistoric setting where there's a really hot woman and men spending all day being complete dimwits. And one thing's for certain: I've never seen a gay caveman before! Anyway, I recommend this movie just for the totally goofy factor. Who would have ever guessed that it came from the same country that gave us ""La strada""?",1524700800,,778,4.524822695035461
7908514,5,B00000FE81,"Almost a three stooges parody, quite imaginative.  Loved the Stone-age scenery.  The acting was superb, esp. caveman Buzzanca ( the eye
movement ), his ability to bamboozle the others with his one cent trick.  Quite enjoyable - - -",1512345600,,231,4.871794871794871

7908518,1,B00000FE81,We were very disappointed.  In the 70's we went to see a movie with the cave man and it was funny that is why I ordered this dvd.  This was not the movie we saw before and it was very poorly made.  I would not recommend this movie for anyone to purchase.  Big waste of money and very disappointed,1389657600,,296,3.9661016949152543

Senta Berger lives with five men in a cave, one of which is gay. It is a bad Flintstones like world shot unashamedly on a set with a painted back drop. The jokes are extremely juvenile.

BLITZ:
The movie opens with Ralph Korda (Jrgen Prochnow) driving a fast car in his white suit wearing sunglasses...at night. If you can get by the 80's opening, you are in for a poorly acted hard to follow film. Korda is an engineer working on an automobile that runs off an energy cell. It will revolutionize how we travel. Needless to say everyone wants it for one reason or another and all the women want his sorry moody butt. There is also a gang of youths displaced by the factory which destroys cars. Hence the original title ""Killing Cars.""

The film isn't worth viewing, even for crime, drama, Senta Berger fans.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, full frontal nudity.",1360713600,4,1304,4.435146443514644
