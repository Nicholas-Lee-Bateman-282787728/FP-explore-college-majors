2682341,4,B000K3VBG4,Was true to how described.  Shipped nicely and in a timely fashion.  Thank you.,1275177600,,79,4.571428571428571
2682342,4,B000K3VBG4,"Had to buy this used video because it is no longer sold in stores. Works like new though. My daughter (3.5 years old) seems to enjoy it as she is really into ballet right now. Some of the characters voices on the video are hard to understand. That is not just due to their Aussie accents. A solid product for those with kids really into ballet. Might be good to get them through the ""phase"" versus more expensive lessons; although my daughter does both.",1265587200,2,453,4.404761904761905
2682343,2,B000K3VBG4,"We were very disappointed in this DVD. The Bella Dancerella Swan Lake and Pop Star DVDs were so much better. My 6 year old daughter has danced with the latter two over and over. The ballet DVD has some goofy ""creatures"" added which gears it more for preschool age and the star in this DVD has an accent which makes her more difficult to understand. It lacked the energy the other two DVDs have.",1265587200,5,394,4.337837837837838
2682344,5,B000K3VBG4,My daughter's original DVD got scratched and after so much use wouldn't play.  This replacement came quickly and worked perfectly.  Would use sellar again.  Thank you.,1244505600,,167,5.346153846153846
2682345,5,B000K3VBG4,", I love them,  terrific and in described condition, fast shipping.",1413072000,,67,5.090909090909091
2682346,1,B000K3VBG4,the dvd was very used with scratches all over and it keeps stopping every few minutes very bad product.,1410220800,,103,4.473684210526316
2682347,3,B000K3VBG4,The costumes are a little corny or dated. Also it seemed like they excluded the little black girl from a lot of the major dance scenes which was disheartening to us bc my daughter was so excited about it until she noticed that . Kids pick up on everything.,1388793600,3,256,4.244897959183674
2682348,1,B000K3VBG4,"The only reason I got this for my daughters is because they had a Cinderella Bella movie on dvd which they loved I assumed this was the same thing, and I was sorely mistaken. The characters are goofy and bizarre, and difficult to even understand. The music they use isn't even close to what is typically used for ballet dancing. The worst part is a little girl who looks to be about five or six in an INCREDIBLY inappropriate outfit. It's not even the same actress for Bella. Definitely not worth it, even at the low price we paid for it. Only kept the girls interest for about ten minutes,",1372636800,2,590,4.372727272727273
2682349,3,B000K3VBG4,"Yes, it has a creepy monkey, two teddies in tutus, and poor production, but my 3 year old watches it over, and over, and over.  She absolutely loves it. She already takes ballet lessons, so this just gives her something to do while on summer break.  The mat and barre aren't absolutely necessary, but helpful.  Buy them used and save some cash.",1372204800,,344,4.516129032258065
2682350,5,B000K3VBG4,"My 5 year old twin granddaughters are entranced by the Bella series.  They get up, move, concentrate and attempt to follow Bella's instructions very seriously.  It's good for them in so many ways and we love watching them try to do the dance moves.  A great series for the little girl in your life!",1360627200,,298,4.481481481481482
2682351,1,B000K3VBG4,Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and it was totally scratched up! She was very disappointed because she love Bella dancerella items.,1357084800,,147,4.92
2682352,5,B000K3VBG4,Wonderful and charming little video! Its fun to watch and dance to. I would recommend it for your little dancer.,1341360000,,112,4.65
2682353,2,B000K3VBG4,"LOTS of talking unrelated to ballet, with a creepy bear and monkey. LOTS Of talking! Also, there is a mat being used, if you don't have the mat, then you're OUT.",1324512000,,161,4.225806451612903
2682354,5,B000K3VBG4,We checked this out on video tape from our library and our 2 year old has gone crazy over it. Every morning she has to put on a different dancing dress and wants her Bellarella. We watch it at least 10 times a day. She dances and sings along with the video. We have a daycare in our home and all of the children love it. Now we have to turn it back in to the library and try to buy the dvd. It's well worth the cherished memories.,1309824000,4,430,3.842696629213483

8154268,5,B000K3VBG4,"Don't buy it! We did years ago for our now 15 year old daughter and are regretting it ever since!
