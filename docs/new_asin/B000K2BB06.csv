8153949,5,B000K2BB06,"This low key DVD really helped me to make some progress with loading my horse.  It didn't look professionally done, lots of background noises, but the information is extremely valuable.",1425859200,,185,5.166666666666667
8153950,2,B000K2BB06,"This may be helpful if you have a young horse who has been started correctly, but it provided little help to solve the problems I was experiencing.  There are no examples of misbehaviors and how to correct them.",1411516800,,211,4.552631578947368
8153951,5,B000K2BB06,"this is a video that you'll need to watch and try and watch again.......and each time watch more closely for the subtle hints and clues

the only thing is i wish they had a complete session no breaks.....with one critter....and rider....and then again.

as a newbie wrangler and longtime horse owner......i just did a 3 day Wilde to broke client.....and then watch these and buck is a master.....i see the light...the clues....but for a newbie....it is overload......so be patient and keep trying......if not you'll have a best friend......and learned so much.......so don't expect a miracle on your first try....like but says practice practise.....and it will come ....its really about communication both ways and this gentle-ING and not breaking a horse",1410048000,,755,5.283333333333333

8153954,5,B000K2BB06,"We always ask ourselves, ""What Would Buck Do?""  We buy and enjoy all of his videos!  But we are especially looking forward to meeting him in person at a clinic in 2014!",1391558400,,168,4.21875
