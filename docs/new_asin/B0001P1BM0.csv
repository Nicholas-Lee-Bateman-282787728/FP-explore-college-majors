2023475,3,B0001P1BM0,"This DVD is a good rental.  But there was a lot of things that bothered me in it.  The journalist that said he was manhandled by IBM security and locked in a room and not allowed to leave until they questioned him about some Internet report.  I found that very hard to believe and was wondering why he didn't file kidnapping charges and sue IBM.  Its not everyday that a rich corporation kidnaps people, Im sure he would have got a huge settlement.

Kasparov throws temper tantrums and acts like a big baby when he loses.  He accuses people of cheating, when the DVD although very one sided in favor of Kasparov shows no evidence that the Deep Blue Team cheated.  Some computer programs play positional chess, I know that Hiarcs is a famous engine that does.  Did they cheat?  I don't know but I sure wasn't convinced that they did.  With a computer engine that runs 50,000,000 positions a second, should we really be surprised when it makes a good move.

I wasn't in to Chess when the match took place in 97.  I remember some things in the news but I couldn't recall who won the series of games.  I was pulling for Kasparov to begin with, but by the end of the documentary I was glad he lost.  He was made out to be some Flash Gordon ""Savior of humanity"" against the evil computer.  But in reality he is a selfish, childish, arrogant, guy who happens to be great at Chess.

Why was they trying to act like this Deep Blue match made him lose to Kramnik and Karpov five years later?  Does Kasparov get to blame every mistake he makes on this ancient history matchup with the computer?  If we could all have such a scapegoat.

I think this movie is worth watching.  It brings up some interesting questions about man and technology.  Personally I don't think losing to a machine is any disgrace.  Deep Blue was space age.  If they created a robot who could K.O. the Heavyweight Champion of the world or outrun the Olympic sprinters would it really change anything?  I don't think so, championships should always be people against people.  But it sure is cool to take on the computers every now and then.",1122768000,26,2100,4.43455497382199

Winged migration.... yawn... But then this comes along, and I watched wide eyed for the whole 1 hour and 25 minutes. There isn't a boring second in this dvd. Its easy to say kasparov is the greatest chess player of all time. We see him beat Grand Masters at age 17 here, we see him beat the pants off Karpov in 1985. Its really captivating to watch someone so superior in the chess field struggle with his own craft. The shady character of IBM build ""deep blue"", and challenge kasparov, which in the end looks to be more like a business move than a challenge (They came out with bragging right and millions of dollars after all the press coverage.) The mind games from IBM seem to have effected Gary so much that he never fully recovered, as we see his old foe of nearly 20 years, Karpov, Rechallenge and defeat him. Overall the story is amazing, and as a bonus for chess nuts, theres even a play by play recall of every move they made in their chess games in the bonus features. But just like the ending credits say ""garry is still the greatest chess player ever""",1122508800,3,1212,4.3201754385964914
2023477,3,B0001P1BM0,"The movie had an interesting story to tell, but it had poor execution. The movie began with a narrator whispering about how IBM's stock rose 15% after the match because Deep Blue won. The whispering was just annoying. The movie had several pointless scenes. It had Kasparov going back to the rooms of his matches with computers and Karpov. Kasparov then described the room.  It really did not help explain anything. Another point, they took you to where Deep Blue was now. Or rather, they took you to where one half of Deep Blue resided. It was two machines. One was at the Smithsonian and the other was at an IBM building. The camera took you to a locked clean room at the IBM building and showed you the locked computer. The operations guy did not have a key for the computer. The camera turned and showed a computer that was turned on. Trust me, I'm in IT. A large unix computer is boring. A turned off computer is even more boring. There are no moving parts. Dead space.

The good parts of the movie is that you have interviews with Kasparov and the IBM team. Kasparov is a charming guy. The IBM team are open and friendly. The movie shows both the bad and good sides of Kasparov, who displays dignity and his temper when he is being pushed around by IBM. The Deep Blue team are interesting, but the IBM company does not come off well. They milk the match for all advertising they could get. The movie keeps touting that it was a victory of machine intelligence over Man, but the point I get from it is, several computer geeks and chess grand masters after years of effort can put together a program that can barely beat a world champion, if they take every single psychological and technical advantage they can. The program is tuned to beat just one man. Since there is no rematch, the whole thing is pointless.

It is an interesting story, but the director choose to tell it in a very unskilled and obtrusive manner.",1120608000,25,1922,4.454545454545454
2023478,3,B0001P1BM0,"This DVD presents a pretty convincing case that IBM cheated, or at the very least acted unsportsmanlike, in the match. The obvious dislike the programming GM has for Kasparov shows as much as anything else. That man acted like a child. It cannot be argued that the chips were stacked against Kasparov in this match. He was obviously uncomfortable from the get go, and IBM was out for blood.

I have never been a fan of human-computer matches. The reason for this is - they are not human vs. computer, they are human vs. many humans + computer. In this case it was Kasparov and a small team against a major corporation, several grandmasters, guards, and a computer with knowledge of every game Kasparov had ever played in his life, not to mention thousands of move sequences input by humans. This is not a fair competition, even without ""cheating"". The computer does not even play the first 15 moves on its own, it follows tables entered by humans. Left on its own with an undeveloped board, it would play poorly. This was proved by Kasparov himself against Fritz, with the opening 1. e3 - the computer did not know what to do here and played poorly. The programmers were careful to include 1. e3 opening lines in future programs.

The so-so part of this DVD is that there are many dead spots. For instance, Kasparov may be standing there saying ""I remember there was a chair here"". So what! That ate up 30 seconds without entertaining anyone. But all in all it is pretty good. And if you're not a big chess fan, don't worry. They don't get too technical in their descriptions of games. It is more of a story for all than a niche story for chess geeks.",1120089600,,1651,4.5
2023479,5,B0001P1BM0,"This is an extremely entertaining movie. I didn't not expect any dramatic revelations and was just enjoying one of the rare opportunities to see  a major production documentary that was devoted to chess and the best player.

From the practical side, I know that cheating with using computers is the main reason that Internet Chess is not a multi-billion dollar business. As a player, I believe that the majority of the players on the net are honest. However, I doubt you can ever get rid of this notion ""what if"", once it gets in your head! Even at the regular tournaments, players are now searched, watched and ... the number of complains is on the rise anyway.

You can make your own conclusions after watching this movie. I wasn't looking for an answer, I just wanted to enjoy the very well done movie and seen familiar faces (chessplayers) and hearing their comments.

2023481,5,B0001P1BM0,"A thoroughly entertaining (if slanted) look at the #1 rated chess player's 2nd match with IBM's Deep Blue computer program. This documentary explores Kasparov's accusation that the IBM's human team of programmers and chess grandmasters helped the machine defeat him in the crucial game 2 of the match (after that Garry's fighting spirit was broken and he subsequently lost the match). While not presenting any new hard evidence that the win was human assisted, it does lay out a fairly damning case. I'm familiar with computer chess programs and their style of play and I have to agree with the film's assertion that Deep Blue's game 2 ""strategic"" moves were anomalous. IBM would not let anyone review DB's data logs from the match, they refused a re-match (standard practice in professional chess), and the company then disassembled the machine. You don't need to know anything about chess or computers to enjoy the film, but if you play chess you'll definitely want to see this!",1115856000,6,980,4.9817073170731705
2023482,2,B0001P1BM0,"Considering the material the producers of this film had to work with - the victory of computer Deep Blue over master player Garry Kasparov in a chess match - this film is rather disappointing. The film beats to death the theory that the programmers of Deep Blue cheated by using human intervention to assist the computer.

Okay. Fine. Maybe they cheated, maybe they didn't. But there is no reason to devote, by allusion, nearly the entire film to this theory. Because that's what it is, a theory, based on one move in one game that the computer ""couldn't have decided to make on its own"", according to Kasparov. No supporting evidence is produced, nor are there any independent experts giving their opinions.

Had the producers of this film stuck to the essence of what this event represented - the battle of the human mind over a pre-programmed machine - this would have made a wonderful documentary. However, by skipping over what this was all about, i.e. computers and chess, the makers of this film missed out on a great opportunity.",1341619200,,1037,4.7555555555555555

2023486,3,B0001P1BM0,"A retrospective on the series of matches played between world chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue, IBM's specially-developed thinking machine. Both sides come off as snide and arrogant, obsessively self-absorbed. Kasparov, whose perspective is the driver for most of the documentary, makes a few sound observations about the shroud of secrecy that surrounded the machine during their fateful second meeting, but ultimately seems most interested in making excuses for his loss. IBM, on the other hand, used the encounter as a highly successful publicity stunt and, having achieved their ultimate goal of a victory against the best in the world, promptly closed up shop without ever offering a rubber match. The filmmakers do a questionable job of remaining unbiased, allowing each party to share their opinions without obstruction, but ultimately spending most of their effort focused on Kasparov's wild conspiracy theories. They also, puzzlingly, give away the ending no less than three times over the course of the picture, effectively killing the drama of the situation. As a result, the docu never builds up a head of steam and winds up as nothing more than a straight, bland, historical record that lacks both a resolution and a truly appealing central figure.",1300406400,,1275,5.316831683168317
2023487,4,B0001P1BM0,"'Game Over' is an excellent documentary of the Kasparov-Deep Blue match of 1997. It has interviews and contributions from both IBM and Kasparov and looks at each game played and reactions to them. It is very insightful to see how each side felt about the match and although fairly even handed, there is a slight bias against IBM with a strong intimation of suspicious behaviour. The constant use of 'The Turk' chess game by the director casts deep aspersions on IBM's integrity and suggests cheating and human intervention by them. The footage from news reports and the match itself really add to the feel of the film. This also looks briefly at Kasparov's career since the Deep Blue match. This is a engaging documentary, of limited appeal to those not interested in chess, but invaluable for those that are. You can normally snap this up cheaply on amazon and it is well worth a viewing.

2023490,2,B0001P1BM0,"The subject is an interesting one, but this documentary is sorely deficient.

The biggest problem is that the film-makers never address the central issue of whether IBM actually cheated or not.  The film is full of accusations and innuendos, but there is essentially no analysis.  I was left confused and frustrated at the end.

The sound quality is terrible.  I kept having to adjust the volume up and down, up and down.  The music is often much too loud and drowns-out the speech.  In general, the background music is too melodramatic and intrusive.

The director used too many ""artsy"" flourishes, like repeatedly -- repeatedly! -- cutting to clips of an old movie about a chess-playing automaton.

There is almost no useful information in the movie about chess or computers.  It's like the film-makers were aiming the movie at the least common denominator.

The movie starts with a story about a ""mechanical Turk"" that defeated Napoleon in chess, but the film-makers never explicitly state that the Turk was a big hoax -- a human was hidden inside the contraption.  Sure, they hint at it, but a resolution to the story would have been a nice way to end the movie.

The film-makers had the opportunity to ask really interesting, probing questions of both Kasparov and the IBM team -- but they dropped the ball.  The interviews are shallow and uninteresting.

Skip this documentary.  There are books written on this subject, and although I haven't read them, I imagine that they're much better than this movie.",1229472000,,1511,4.889763779527559
2023491,2,B0001P1BM0,"Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine examines the infamous 1997 rematch between then world-champion Gary Kasparov and IBM's chess supercomputer, Deep Blue. Kasparov had defeated an earlier incarnation of Deep Blue the previous year, but in 1997 the new and improved computer defeated him in a six-game match: two wins to one with three draws.

Speculation was rampant that IBM had rigged the match by allowing a human player to override the computer on certain key moves. As evidence, conspiracy theorists pointed to moves wherein Kasparov offered the sacrifice of a pawn, and the computer turned it down. Pawn sacrifices, which strong players often use to garner positional advantages or to gain initiative, were long considered too abstract for a computer to understand. A machine, many argued, could not possibly see far enough ahead to truly appreciate the subtle positional edge that a good sacrifice can provide. Therefore, a human must have been helping the computer out. Who could expect a human player, even one as brilliant as Kasparov, to defeat the combination of human and computer?

The film makes frequent reference to ""The Turk"", a chess-playing automaton that was famous in the 18th century. Travelling around Europe, it impressed monarchs and noblemen with its astonishing ability. The Turk was a hoax; a human player, concealed beneath the machine, operated the arms and made the moves himself. Dramatizations of the historical episode, borrowed from black and white films, appear frequently throughout Game Over (in fact they constitute something of a thematic refrain). The analogy is obvious, and certainly compelling. Could Deep Blue have been a modern day Turk, an elaborate fraud perpetrated by IBM to garner publicity? It's hard not to be intrigued by the question, but unfortunately, the intrigue ends there. ""Game Over"" does not present a single shred of evidence to support its hypothesis. Instead, it relies esclusively (and I do mean exclusively) on innuendo.

Over and over, a shaky camera presents us with blurred visuals while a hushed voice wonders aloud about the supposedly ""un-computer-like"" moves that Deep Blue made during the match. One interviewee after another questions the machine's strangely profound understanding of the game. The film ends with a gradual interior tracking shot of the warehouse in which the de-commisioned supercomputer now resides (it's hard not think of the final shot from Raiders of the Lost Ark), while the narrator laments that the truth may never be known. All this is very mysterious, yes, but it's also utterly unconvincing.

It wasn't so long ago that otherwise rational people proclaimed with certainty that no computer would ever beat a human world champion. Chess, they said, is too full of pattern-recognition, of strategy and subtlety, for a computer to grasp in full. How could any person with even a basic knowledge of chess and computer science have legitimately believed this? While the number of possible positions in chess is astronomical, it is still finite, and a sufficiently powerful computer should, in theory, be able to ""solve"" the game (that is, determine the ideal move for every position). Even today, no computer is capable of this. But as processors grew more and more powerful, it was inevitable that they would come close enough to their lofty goal that they would surpass the limits of human chess ability. From then on, the world champion would never again be a human.

Should it really surprise us that an exceptionally powerful computer (which, at the time, Deep Blue was) would be able to look far enough ahead to see that a small material gain now would cost it dearly later on? ""Game Over"" sustains itself on nothing more than baseless insinuations about the IBM programming team. What is most offensive about this is the way that the programmers are demonized for crushing humanity's hopes of perpetual chess supremacy. Should it not be viewed as an equally great triumph of human ingenuity that a team of computer scientists was able to create a machine more skilled even than Kasparov, a genius who had devoted his life to the study of chess?

Compounding the absurdity is the fact that a year before this film was released, world champion Vladimir Kramnik drew an eight-game match against the chess program Fritz, which can be purchased for a small sum at your local Best Buy and installed on your home computer. One wonders if the producers of Game Over were aware of this.",1222041600,2,4484,5.077340569877883

2023493,4,B0001P1BM0,"As a strong chess player myself, the movie was very interesting in finding out more about the world chess champion, how his mind works, and how he looks at the world from his point of view be it real or imagined.

No question about it.  Garry is a very unique individual and appears to belong to a new breed of chess players, a breed that is idealistic but at the same time very engaged in world events with a willingness to change events and sometimes take extreme risks in doing so.

To truly appreciate the film and understand Garry's behaviour, one must first know the man, his background, how he got to where he is, and the tremendous pressure he has been subjected to in the chess world, right before taking the world championship from Anatoly Karpov.  Unlike Bobby Fisher, Garry has the human element and he can express himself very well in English which incidentally is not his native tongue.

What impresses me most about this man is that unlike most world chess champions, he has his ego very much under control.  His demonstration of frustration over IBM's very secretive tactics is understandable.  IBM's failure to make ""deep blue"" transparent to the rest of the world and  most particularly to the challenger, Garry Kasparov, has resulted in the ""cheating"" controversy.  So IBM is also partly to blame because of their unwillingness to be ""transparent"" and to make the computer logs available to Garry's team.  This behaviour makes IBM suspect because of their secretiveness and unwillingness to put the computer in front of Garry actually printing out the computers responses.  He probably would have preferred to play ""deep blue"" face to face where he could actually see the computer print out or the suggested best move (similar to computer chess programs available in the market today) so that human intervention will not even be suspected.  This is very similar to the USA GMAT exams under the new computer based testing format where the candidate get's their test scores immediately right after taking the exams eliminating the possibility of ""lobbying or backroom negotiations"" after the fact.  The computerized exams insures that no human intervention will happen right after the exam is completed.  In the paper based test completed in ""pencil"" which is not indelible, of course the answers can be erased and changed to favor a certain University or college who have influence, or certain interest groups for that matter.  In Europe and Asia, board exams are conducted in ""ink"" and is indelible.  The candidates for licensure also have a chance to question and dispute their score reports, and the government encourages the candidate to take a look at his/her examination sheet if he/she suspects any errors made by the evaluator.  So the candidates are comfortable and are given a chance to question the body responsible for scoring the exams if cheating is suspected to have been initiated by the ""test-administrator"" and not by the ""candidate.""

Unlike the other great grandmasters who died penniless, like Alexander Alekhine, or became vagabonds or gypsies like Bobby Fisher who was exiled from the USA due to irresponsible political comments he made against the Bush administration, Garry Kasparov appears to live in a different and down to earth political reality.  You see,  Garry is a survivor.  And not only that he is a folk hero back in Russia.  He is the most normal world chess champion I have ever seen over the years.  In his youth he used to date gorgeous women in New York City.  In fact he was even given a plane to escape the USSR, where he grew up, to come to the USA years ago when he was a young man during the turmoil that was happening there.  He has also worked at the New York Times, and has been invited to numerous talk shows in the USA and have been a guest of world leaders and business leaders all around the world.

But what fascinates me most about this man is that he continues his influence far beyond the chess world and into the political arena back in Russia after retirement from the game.  In just 2 years since his retirement from the professional game of chess he has emerged as a leader of the political opposition in Russia, earning the world's admiration for his dogged and fearless campaign for free and fair elections in his homeland.  Infact just last year, 2006-2007, he was arrested in Moscow together with a number of his followers for his involvement in public demonstrations against the ""Putin"" regime.  He was eventually released.  If he probably entered the political arena earlier we may see possibilities for him in the Russian Politburo.  Or perhaps if he was a lawyer like Dr. Alekhine or an engineer like Jose Raoul Capablanca, then he would have secured political clout with the KGB or even with Putin himself because most Russian leaders are academically credentialed.  But the Putin regime I think views him as a mere ""chess player.""  And being the best ""chess player"" in the world does not necessarily qualify you for Putin's job.  But it does help him influence the political process in various ways because of his popularity.

My take on the movie is that it was made to serve Garry's political ambitions beyond the chess world.  He used it as a vehicle and platform to get his message across with the support of not only IBM but various multinational corporations behind the scenes.  It is obvious that the USA is supporting him.  Whether or not there is CIA involvement here remains to be seen.  Perhaps, if he was an engineer, a lawyer, or a professional accountant in the USA, he could have taken Roberto Goizueta's job and would have spear headed the Coca-Cola corporation's recovery overtaking Pepsico once more.  But one thing I do know, he is putting his life on the line today back in Russia.  He could have just lived here in the USA, and enjoyed the good life.  He has found his fortune in the USA, is rich and comfortable by USA standards, and yet he wants to go back.  He could've gotten his USA MBA and run for governor of New York and may be the white house later on.  But something, that is not clear, perhaps only he knows, has brought him back to Moscow.  Whether this can be seen as a ""political vendetta"" or not, one thing is clear, he is no longer under the protection of the United States government.  Putin is tolerating him because perhaps deep down Putin likes him for this man has truly brought glory to Russia.",1203206400,2,6426,4.743474347434743
2023494,2,B0001P1BM0,"I went into this movie with high hopes.  The subject of a grand chess master taking on a supercomputer is inherently fascinating, and could have been used as a jumping-off point to investigate a rich vein of interesting topics: what was the philosophical significance of this showdown between man and machine?  What did it mean to the chess world, and to society at large?  What defines a grand master-level chess player, and what goes through Kasparov's head as he contemplates his individual moves and overall strategies?  How does this differ with the problem-solving programming that the computer is relying on?  Just how do you program a computer to simulate the chess-playing style of a grand master?  And how can a documentary movie creatively capture the essence of a complex chess match onscreen, making it real and involving for the average audience?

Sadly, ""Kasparov and the Machine"" does not address a single one of these questions -- especially not the last one.  It is a plodding documentary that mostly consists of a film crew following Kasparov around the rather drab location where the match took place years earlier, as he reflects on his poor treatment by IBM.  It also features some uninformative interviews with the computer programmers, and a lot of footage from a black and white silent movie about a chess machine from the 1800's that is terribly overused.  A poorly substantiated conspiracy theory is advanced that IBM was somehow not playing fairly, and what might have been a good 30-minute PBS special is stretched out into a very thin feature length film.

This could have been a great, thought-provoking film exploring the ramifications of a man pitting his intellect against an artificial intelligence.  It is tragic that the filmmakers missed such an opportunity to sweep us away with the complex consideration that this subject deserved.",1173571200,6,1871,5.078431372549019

At its best scenes, the film is an entertaining look at the never ending competition of human intellect against artificial. The greatest player on Earth does not like and does not know how to lose, and his account of the match and its result is quite bitter. He can't believe that the computer program, the combination of 0s and 1s may appear to think like a human. It was sad and nostalgic for me to see Gary like that. I remember him back in 1985, 22 years old World Champion after his victorious match with Anatoly Karpov. In his (and former mine) country millions of people that knew nothing or next to nothing about ancient game of chess (All I know that the first move e2 - e4 will not bring me any problems, at least for a little while) passionately wished him to win. Gary was not just a brilliant chess genius, a wonder-boy - he was also a symbol of hope, of changes not only in the chess politics but in the life of the whole country that was ready for changes.

This documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance.  After watching it, I am sad to say, I felt like I wasted my time.  One of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time.  It has the typical MTV type editing, where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds.  It is very sad that filmmaking has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.

I understand it is difficult to make a film about chess, but that does not mean one should make it flashy.  'Game Over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though.  It brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level.  This is what Kasparov thought after the match, but this film does not go deep enough with this idea.  Also, this film tries to bring in a bizzare theory.  It tries to imply the paranoid theory that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer.  Kasparov had suspicions about this, but still to this day there is no evidence.  Towards the end of the film, it tries to imply the bizzare idea that maybe Anatoly Karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of Deep Blue.  Interesting to think about, but I don't know how plausable or realistic it is.  I still would not recommend this movie though, not even for chess addicts.",1165622400,4,1801,4.3283582089552235
2023497,5,B0001P1BM0,"Deep Blue Conspiracy Theory

Whether the match of Kasparov versus Deep Blue was a fair match is a matter of debate. I came up with the following conspiracy theory just for fun, but which could be plausible and consistent with the evidence presented in the movie. IBM, as a corporation, wanted to win at whatever cost, since the company's reputation was at stake and potential for economic revenue would be great. (The movies Enron, The Smartest Guys in the Room; McLibel; Wal-Mart, The High Cost of Low Price; and The Corporation are eye opening films in this respect) IBM, as shown in the movie, created two Deep Blue computers. Kasparov suspected that both computers were present at the match, although there is no conclusive evidence of this. Imagine that one was a true computer and the one Kasparov easily beat in the first match. As a computer engineer myself, it is easy to imagine having a chess master inside the other Deep Blue with a terminal receiving strategic recommendations from the true Deep Blue computer. The human player inside the other Deep Blue would have a clear advantage from the sheer computing capacity of the other computer, consistent with Kasparov's suspicion. The true Deep Blue Computer would be the one in the Smithsonian museum, and the fake Deep Blue is the one in Poughkeepsie, NY, which they failed to open at the end of the movie. Notice that the man from IBM could easy fit inside Deep Blue. This man-computer double team strategy could have been employed starting with game number 2, where Kasparov surrendered. The idea of having somebody inside the Deep Blue computer is more romantic, but unnecessary for this conspiracy theory to work. It is interesting that the dimensions of deep blue could easily conceal a tall man standing. If you've ever played tic-tac-toe with a computer, you will soon learn that the best you can do is tie the game. A match with a player of Kasparov's stature playing against a pure computer opponent, would be expected to end in a draw or at least be more balanced in terms of how many games each wins.

Karpov Conspiracy Theory

If you have a large screen where you can watch the movie, notice that during the match between Kasparov and Karpov at the end of the movie, somebody was flashing a laser pointer on Kasparov's left side of the nose. This happens in one of the earlier close-ups of Kasparov's face after a close up of his feet. Was someone deliberately trying to distract Kasparov with a laser pointer?",1163203200,2,2485,4.747685185185185
2023498,1,B0001P1BM0,"I had rented Game Over with high hopes. I enjoy chess and I'm in the computer industry.  I figured how could I lose?  Well, I did.

This is a 30 minute documentary crammed in 85 minutes.  It's basic point is that Deep Blue made a strategic move in game two (of six) that Kasparov didn't think was possible for a machine.  This move so distressed him that he resigned from a drawn position.

Then over the next four games he drove himself into such a tizzy that he made a simple blunder in Game 6 and lost.  The computer hadn't even started computing when he resigned, it was still simply reading the moves out of a chess opening book.

On the other side, the IBM team decided that somehow having an enormous team of people design a computer that can beat a single man in a single six game tournament was the be all and end all of life.  They come across as petty and foolish.  In the end they complain that Kasparov had drained all the fun out of winning.

So I guess we all learned a lesson about sportsmanship, eh?

This movie's only redeeming feature is that it showed that Deep Blue didn't really beat Kasparov.  He beat himself.  If he hadn't resigned a drawn position in Game 2 the match would have ended in a draw.  In addition if he had kept control of his emotions he probably would have won the whole thing.

Of course, the IBM team probably knew this when they refused a rematch and it was another instance where they came off looking like jerks.

I could have given this movie two stars if it weren't for the awful direction.  The director cut so sporadically between shots that I was forced to turn my head away to avoid dizziness several times.  That, along with the repetitive footage and melodramatic music made this a dreadful experience.",1153872000,20,1755,4.394409937888199
2023499,4,B0001P1BM0,"This following review will be a spoiler from start to finish, but I'd like to think I'm bringing in a different and worthwhile perspective.  I'd like to try to refute some common assumptions about this film, assumptions which have turned most of the reviews on this page into a simplistic debate.

Did this film go into enough detail about chess to satisfy the truly initiated?  Or was it ""dumbed down"" for an audience primarily consisting of people who don't live and breathe the game?

That's a question this film inevitably raises.  But it's too shallow a basis for a review, particularly if it dominates the discussion.

[SPOILER alert again.  If you haven't seen this film--and you don't want any details of the film to be revealed--then skip down the page to the next review.  Otherwise, you'll see spoilers all over the place.  In this instance, I'm not overly worried.  After all the media coverage of Kasparov v. Deep Blue, much of what I'm saying is not going to be a surprise even to folks who've never heard of Game Over.]

In chess, you win or you lose.  IBM doesn't play that game.

What we have here is a documentary which is painfully obvious in its bias: IBM must have cheated.  This conclusion is never stated, but no one viewing the film could fail to get the message.  There must have been some sort of conspiracy: even though the details of the conspiracy are never revealed, and no evidence is presented.

Oh, how unfair to impugn the ethics of IBM and the Deep Blue team.

The preceding was a synopsis of the majority of amazon.com reviews of Game Over.

Let me make a wild guess:  most of these reviewers know a lot more about chess than about cinema.

Documentaries have a point-of-view.  (Or, at least, this is true of all of the best documentaries ever made.)

Accusing a documentary of being biased is like accusing Garry Kasparov of having a big ego.  No one will disagree with you, but then, it's not a front-page headline either.

Don't be misled by the ubiquity of complaints, among the reviews written by chess geeks:  that the film doesn't ever get into the meaty details of what should be the film's subject:  the great game of chess.

This is not a film about chess.

Suppose it were.  Each and every chess geek alive would have paid to see Game Over in the theater, and a lot of them would have paid to see it ten times.

And this film--a low-budget film--wouldn't have made a penny in profit.  Because no one but chess geeks would have been able to understand it.

Which is why this film is not about chess; it's about the intrigue behind the scenes of one of the most famous chess matches in history.  That's what makes it a film with the potential to draw an audience.  Few people are fluent in algebraic notation for chess moves.  But the John Henry legend?  Now, that is something we all know.

Why is there is no evidence?

Because IBM took great care--before, during, and after the match--to veil every aspect of their Deep Blue project with the same level of secrecy applied by the CIA when planning a covert operation.

""We can't reveal trade secrets.""  Not the most credible explanation, when you consider:  of all the hardware and software IBM developed in association with Deep Blue, how much of it was later applied to IBM products in the marketplace?

None.  After Deep Blue ""won"", everything was dismantled, locked away, shredded or incinerated.

Everything was weighted against Kasparov.  In nanoseconds, Deep Blue could examine every move of every game Kasparov ever played.  But Kasparov knew nothing of his opponent.  The Deep Blue he'd once defeated had become a different player:  its hardware more powerful, and its software radically updated.  And because the rules allowed IBM to tweak Deep Blue between games, Kasparov (in effect) faced a new opponent with each successive game.

Finally, there's the ultimate human factor.  Tournament chess is exhausting: not only mentally, but also emotionally and physically.

Computers never get tired.

So why did Kasparov agree to the match?  (If you can call it a ""match"".  No chess tournament between human players lasts only six games.)

Hubris, perhaps.  Kasparov has plenty of that.

But as director Vikram Jayanti notes in his commentary on the DVD, one thing Kasparov lacks is ""worthy opponents"".  Chess is his life.  Yet, at times, he must feel a kind of boredom.  No one in the world can give him the thrill of a true challenge.  Not even Karpov (not consistently), or Fischer (unless he were younger, and sane).

Some say that's why Deep Blue won fair and square.  Because until Kasparov faced the 1997 version of Deep Blue, he'd almost never been seriously worried about losing.  So, when Kasparov lost Game Two, he also lost something he'd never lost before:  his confidence.

Then there's the alternate explanation.  That even if Kasparov didn't fully understand chess software, he has a better grasp of the ""style"" of individual players--their strengths and weaknesses, the patterns in their play--than anyone alive.  After Deep Blue in Game Two played so differently than in Game One, Kasparov realized the odds were against him...to a greater degree than could be explained by the rules.

There was only one explanation.

IBM cheated.

In what way?  Game Over, unfortunately, cannot answer this key question.  There is no evidence.

Facing growing suspicion, the IBM team promised to begin making available more (and better) logs of Deep Blue's play.

But these logs were never forthcoming.  The promises were not kept.

The ""un-machinelike"" moves which suddenly appeared in Game Two: where did they come from?  IBM and their defenders say Deep Blue was destined to beat any human opponent.  Computer technology would inevitably advance to the point when ""look ahead"" became fast enough, and there could be enough ""plies"", that a brute-force technique could overwhelm even the most intelligent strategy.

The retort of the dissenters:  starting with Game Two, whenever Deep Blue chose a bad move, the grandmasters on the IBM team overruled the computer.  If necessary, they substituted a human decision.  That, anyway, is the most popular theory.

Remember, though, that the IBM team could reprogram Deep Blue after every game.  Those members of the team who weren't consultants, who worked directly for IBM:  if the computer lost the match, what about their jobs?

They were highly motivated.  Suppose they decided to reprogram not only after games, but also after MOVES?  So much more efficient.  That would be only a slight bending of the rules...wouldn't it?

But that's the employees' point-of-view.  What about the corporate view?

Kasparov vs. Deep Blue could be an historic marketing success.  Compelling news stories with an angle favorable to IBM:  that creates exposure, attention and credibility in ways that no amount of advertising can achieve.

It's often cited that shares of IBM stock rose in value after Deep Blue won.  But what is a corporation's most valuable asset? Any executive today will tell you: brand image.

This is the REAL game.

A corporation has a ""fiduciary responsibility"" to put the next quarter's bottom-line ahead of all other considerations.

IBM was compelled to do everything possible to ensure a win for Deep Blue.  It would be a violation of that responsibility if they didn't exploit every possible angle.  If Deep Blue had lost, how many shareholders lawsuits would IBM have faced?

A corporation as powerful as IBM rarely loses civil cases.  But think of all the additional attorneys to hire, and their billable hours...including overtime.

(Think, also, of the boardroom discussions which would have ensued:  ""How could we spend $XX million on this project and not have a plan:  to make sure Big Blue couldn't possibly lose?  Anyone who thinks it's more important to 'play fair' had better start updating their resume."")

Keeping all this in mind:  imagine the ""suggestions"" to the Deep Blue team from IBM's executives.

But...it would be shockingly unethical for IBM to tell their employees to cheat. They would never do that.",1150588800,6,8091,4.9067357512953365
2023500,5,B0001P1BM0,"This is a good documentary film taken from the perspective of Kasparov. The film is made to make you believe that the game was conconcted in some way by some powerful corporations/individuals, that there were some unexplained mysterious things (reminds you of X-Files serial) going on behind the scene that led to Kasparov defeat. It is successful in portraying the image of a single man fighting the selfish big bad corporations. Was it the frailties of man that led to defeat ? Could deep blue win if Kasparov was at his best ? The film makes us a skeptic and question the outcome and its reasons - Did Deep Blue win the match or did Kasparov lost the match to Deep Blue ?
Check the film to find out the many unanswered questions. My biggest question is - Is the Man versus Machine challenge decided for Chess or do we need another rematch.
The film lacks in its editing and storyline. The wishpering dialog is bit annoying. The biography of kasparov, old black-and-white Turk movie takes the focus away from the main theme. The sequential narration of storyline with respect to events would have been better (especially for those who aren't aware of the match) than the back-and-forth narration. Film failed to emphasize the key moments and thus lost to take advantage of the suspense. For a novice who don't know the controversy sorrounding the match, this movie will be hard to understand and look like a movie made by combining patches of shots from different sources.
So the 5 star is for the content of the film but it will be a 1 star for the way it is presented.",1147219200,2,1572,4.597864768683274

The film documents the recollections of Kasparov's journey during and after his encounter with Deep Blue.  If you know about this match, then this movie would probably be worth your time just because it provides a lot of insight into what went on behind the scenes.  The director does a great job of creating a workable theme throughout the film.  The director uses the Turk, again if you don't know what this first ""computer"" program was, you just might not get the point of the theme.

Anyways, I enjoyed the emotion, the clever theme, and even the odd background whispering every so often.  I have a strong feeling that people with no chess interest would give this film a 1 or 2, but I give it a 4 b/c I love chess and it is a solid documentary.",1145491200,2,1000,4.304812834224599
2023502,5,B0001P1BM0,"Just like another excellent documentary, Capturing the Friedmans, Game Over presents its evidence evenly and thereby creates uncertainty in the mind of the viewer as to what transpired and for whom one should sympathize. Initially, I regarded Gary Kasparov as being, yet another, in a long line of fantastically gifted individuals who happened to be slightly paranoid and lacking in social skills, yet, by the end, he won me over. I sided with him in regards to the unfairness of the bizarre and deceptive acts of IBM. Now that's not to infer in any way that he was a victim. Certainly, Kasparov was paid plenty of money, money that would change the average man's life forever, so we should not feel too sorry for him about being used by Big Technology, but, anyway, he was used by Big Technology-or Big Blue as it were. The result is that we empathize mightily with Kasparov who is a flawed human being facing a monster he cannot see or hear. One moment in the film was truly touching and it occurred when Kasparov strolled into the auditorium following a defeat. The fans responded by showering him with a standing ovation. The look of surprise and gratitude on his face was endearing. The story and plot of Game Over is very interesting and worth recommending on its own, but it is the affectational impact that was most redeeming. Kasparov, in person, is probably a most trying soul with tremendous expectations of others, but--compared to IBM, a corporation that lied to him, refused to give him the dignity of a rematch, and then dismantled Big Blue before anyone could find out the exact way in which the apparatus worked-makes Gary look like a man of the people. The morphing of a one in a million genius into an everyman may be the movie's greatest achievement.",1141257600,3,1770,4.712903225806452
2023503,2,B0001P1BM0,"This is a cinma vrit-style spoof about an often-misunderstood group of humans: film-school sophomores.

There is no explicit mention of the subject-matter. Instead, the film wittily pretends to be a documentary produced by actual film-school sophomores. The premise is quite delicious, but the execution is rather heavy-handed and merciless &#8211; surely no group of people smart enough to talk their way into film school would collectively make ALL of these mistakes?

It goes for the jugular during the opening credits. The subtext is a late-night, drunken conversation: &#8220;If we're going to make a documentary, then we need voice-overs. But that's been done to death. We're more original than that, so what if instead we do WHISPER-OVERS!&#8221;

The results are indeed hilarious, but was it really necessary to also imply that their technical skills are so limited that the whisper-overs sound like a cat being strangled down the other end of a drain-pipe?

(For viewers watching at home: things become just a little more intelligible if you switch audio playback from Dolby Digital to plain old Dolby Pro-Logic.)

But that's just an early lapse. Once it gets going, it gets subtler and finds surer ground for its slash-and-burn satire. For example, only when the end mercifully arrives do you realize that the supposed subject-matter - chess - IS ALMOST NEVER ADDRESSED and certainly not explained.

The director throws them a single fig-leaf of mercy, allowing them to describe in almost adequate detail the match-changing move in game 2 when IBM's Deep Blue refuses a sacrifice pawn and instead goes for position.

(Back in the real world for a moment: Kasparov indeed went into a tail-spin after that move, and spent the rest of the match obsessing about IBM cheating. He never recovered his balance. IBM, of course, assisted his mind-state in every way they could.)

There are a couple of other high points. The &#8220;original music&#8221; is very witty &#8211; I only wish the filmmakers could have had the courage of their convictions and introduced an actual Theremin. Instead, they only imply it.

There are constant cutaways to a mock-up of the famous &#8220;Turk&#8221; &#8211; an early chess-playing scam, and even more cutaways to a dreadful silent film depiction of the same. These are properly pretentious and boring, as they're supposed to be.

But the whole thing falls apart with their choice of actor for Gary Kasparov himself. For one thing, he looks just like him. But he comes across as gracious, self-deprecating, and almost modest. That's never Kasparov!

The end of the match is done rather well, and is just like the ending of &#8220;Rocky,&#8221; but without the blood: &#8220;There ain't gonna be no rematch!&#8221; Being the amateurs that they are, the sophomores completely fail to explain that rather crucial point.

I'd give it more stars, if the result were actually interesting, but that's the trouble with spoofs &#8211; if you can't admit you're spoofing, the whole thing just seems too, too real.",1134864000,5,3043,5.150101419878296
2023504,3,B0001P1BM0,"In 1997, Gary Kasparov, the best chess player at the time, fought an intellectual duel with an IBM computer.  This is the
documentary about the event and his loss. The sense that I had was that the IBM team developed a computer that was the mind equal of Kasparov in chess - neither better nor worse.  However, the computer does not get emotional so when the machine made
a brilliant chess move worthy of a great chess master, Kasparov lost his equilibrium and collapsed before the power of the machine.  The metaphysical quality of the combat was very intriguing.  The quality of the movie was nowhere as good as it could have been...the innuendo that (maybe) IBM cheated was
absolutely undocumented. However, it was also clear that Kasparov was not given examples of previous chess games Deep Blue had played whereas the computer had the benefit of prior Kasparov strategies. Thus, in a sense, the man had a handicap against the machine.

  Throughout the movie there are flashbacks to a silent film
called THE CHESS PLAYER about an earlier contest between a chess machine and master chess players. The machine was known as the Turk because it was designed to look (in part) like a Turkish aristocrat.  If you miss seeing ""Game Over"", don't miss reading the fascinating book ""The Turk"" by Tom Standage.

The filmakers had every opportunity to tell it - they had interviews with Kasparov and his team, interviews with members of the IBM team that designed and 'trained' Deep Blue, and interviews with famous chess analysts.  In spite of all that, this film fails on all levels.

What could have been a spellbinding glimpse into the unfathomable mind of humanity's greatest chess player is instead a blatant anti-corporate propaganda piece, complete with the obligatory Enron reference.

Bizarre atonal music, jumpy hand-held defocused cameras, strange camera angles, freakish lighting, and multiple instances (dozens and dozens) of footage from an early silent movie about a charlatan who fakes a chess-playing robot - all these things are heaped one upon another to make viewing this film a painful experience.

Chess lovers will find nothing of worth here, and people looking for a human-interest piece will be turned off by the childish conspiracy-theory rants of most of the interviewees.  It's one thing to film Kasparov floundering, grasping at conspiracy-theory straws to excuse his loss.  This is interesting in the manner of a train wreck that you can't turn away from.  It's quite another thing to collect a gaggle of Kasparov's sycophants, his business partners, and a few anti-corporate axe-grinders and allow them to  all contribute to this fantasy ad nauseum.  Kasparov's enablers are a sorry bunch and they make for a poor quality film.

It's well known that the volatile Kasparov is lacking in the maturity department.  It could have made for a very interesting film to see how such a singular mind was demoralized and beaten down by the Deep Blue affair.

This is not a documentary about chess: it's about human psychology. I have read reviews (clearly written by chess players) that complain that the documentary has not enough chess analysis. However, the purpose of the documentary is not to provide an analysis of the Kasparov-Deep Blue match. It is a poignant story about how frail human psychology can be, even in the case of the man who can probably claim to have the strongest character in the history of the game (don't forget that Kasparov won the world title against ALL the odds in 1984-1985). You don't need to know anything about chess to understand and ejoy this documentary: that's what is really great about it. We get to see the greatest player in the history of the game being broken systematically not only by the people who designed Deep Blue, but by the IBM corporation's knowledge of what makes the human mind tick. In this way, the director's interpretation of the match is profoundly disturbing, yet truly brilliant. Finally, the documentary, in spite of dealing with such a controversial event, manages never to take sides: we get to see the best and worst of Kasparov and the Deep Blue team that defeated him. If you're not sure about this, consider the documentary's last line. Vikram Jayanti smirks knowingly at all us chess players with the line ""yet Kasparov is still the greatest player in the history of the game"": he knows we refuse to acknowledge the fact (horrifying as it may be) that a machine, Deep Blue, has now proved to be the  best chess player of all time.

You hear Kasparov discuss his suspicions about human interference (i.e., assisting the computer) in at least one of the games.  People from the Deep Blue team then explain their strategy for the match and of course deny any human help of the computer's moves.

Unfortunately, no game analysis is provided for those viewers who wish to see it.  Though such analysis exists in books and online, I would have enjoyed being able to watch the games replayed on the DVD along with GM commentary.  Perhaps as a compromise, at least key combinations or positions could have been analyzed.

I also didn't really care for the whispers utilized to make various comments during the documentary.  I didn't feel that they  provided any dramatic effect; in fact, they seemed to me like a cheap Hollywood tactic.

Considering Kasparov achieved only draws (as the end result) in matches against Deep Junior and Fritz 3D in recent years, I suppose one might ask, ""What exactly does this DVD bring to the table?""

Rather the film is far shortsighted for missing out on the most important point: the birth of machine learning as a new field and how lucky was Kasparov to be part of its first experiment.,1511568000,2,538,4.444444444444445

8016001,2,B0001P1BM0,"The series of games that lead to Big Blue defeating then reigning human chess champion Gary Kasparov are a very impressive topic. This could have been a very interesting topic from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, the philosophical implications of the man and machine relationship, business implications for IBM (its stock rose 15% the say Big Blue defeated Kasparov) and the IT industry and the two sides (Kasparovs as well as the team that developed Big Blue). Unfortunately this documentary does not do a very good job. This is so for a number of reasons. One is that there are some straight forward and startling errors. For example, with respect to the Mechanical Turk, a chess playing machine of the late 1700s which is used allegorically throughout the movie, it was stated that no one was able to uncover its secret. The reality is that the secret was uncovered. It was a midget that was the inside the cabinet containing the machine.

Another problem is the too subtle discussion regarding possible cheating on the part of IBM. This series of games was supposed to be human vs computer per se (with no human intervention on computers side). Unfortunately the documentary really does not get at this, at least in an obvious manner. Kasparov stated that Big Blue made really strange move and he also stated, in a different part of the movie that a human  computer relationship is very powerful. He was very prescient here in that, today, the most powerful players are not pure humans or pure chess programs like Fritz, Rybka or supercomputers for that matter running specialized software but instead humans working together with computer programs as teams. Teams of humans working with computers, at least so far, have been able to defeat both human players alone as well as computers alone. That is today but back when Kasparov was defeated very few would have expected things to turn out this way. But Kasparov did. This is a very important point but one that, at least to a layman, would be very difficult to get out of the movie. This should have been made explicit in the movie as well as discussed. Instead the viewer gets a picture of a very angry Kasparov who looks childlike, instead of being justifiably angry that the terms of tournament could have been (very justifiably) broken.

One last but serious problem is that too much time spent on style and not on substance. There are too many images (and time) wasted on the mechanical Turk that keeps making perpetual appearances in the documentary serving allegorical purposes that could have been far better spent discussing the implications of the games with chess and artificial intelligence experts. Hence the movie, in this reviewers opinion, is only worthy of a 2 star rating.  Very disappointing for a BBC documentary.",1407628800,,2803,4.894736842105263
8016002,5,B0001P1BM0,Did IBM create a chess computer that beat the world chess champion? Or did they cheat. Little known facts about this legendary tournament cast doubt on IBM win. Why was the computer hidden during play? Why were several chess champion's working for IBM also hidden with Deeper Blue during the match?  Why did Kasparov agree to this arrangement? Perhaps the human brain is far superior than we have been led to believe.,1401753600,,417,4.791666666666667

8016004,3,B0001P1BM0,"As a person deeply interested in computer chess and the implications for proof computers can behave ""intelligently"" - even if within a very narrow domain -- I very much wanted to enjoy this movie.  Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, the production was rather poorly done, and the audio and video quality were generally subpar.  Plus the piece was scattered and reeked of bias and paranoia.

IBM was far from as open as they should have been, especially with the Deep Blue logs -- but the ""all corporations are evil"" slant gets old.

Sadly, it seems that Kasparov largely defeated himself over his paranoia that IBM was cheating since he couldn't fathom a brilliant strategic ""non-computer-like"" move in the second game.

For those who are uninformed about how computer chess programs really work -- instead of speculating and looking for hobgoblins, reading ""Behind Deep Blue"" will tell you a lot about how the program and machine were constructed, and what the IBM team (and their consultant, Chess GM Joel Benjamin) really did to improve the program when creating Deep Blue from the results of Deep Thought.  This fine book told me perhaps 100 times about what was really going on with the chess, the software and the hardware, as the movie.

Joel's extensive work with playing against Deep Blue for months and telling the programmers why Deep Blue did stupid things strategically, and why, and how it SHOULD be looking at key positions is the most logical answer.  Some of that programming almost certainly paid off.  This is a real accomplishment for Joel Benjamin, the programmers, and the future of artificial intelligence.

When I wrote my chess program as my final major college project work in 1981 -- even with a simple, slow program -- I learned a LOT about how counter-intuitive computer chess play can be.  My goal at the time was to make a program that played more like a human than any program of the day -- blunders, surprises, and all.

I did this simply by aggressively weighting positional factors vs. piece values -- in situations which seemed highly likely to be ""worth it"".  The result was that when play-testing the program, even as the programmer, I was often surprised.  One game the computer sacrificed it's queen -- in 1981.  Yes, not two pawns as people claim was ""impossible"" in 1997, for Deep Blue.  And later, beyond the brute force horizon of the program, it checkmated me.  I was shocked, yet pleased, as at the time I WAS SURE IT WAS A BUG I would have to fix.

Later that semester, I grinned as I watched the program carry out a furious attack and chase my king across the board.  When it had me in a very promising looking attack, I had to sacrifice MY queen to hopefully save myself.  The machine DECLINED to take the queen, and continued to chase my king all the way to safety on the other wing (again, beyond the program's brute force horizon).  So now I was groaning -- the program was so wildly inconsistent -- like a club player in a speed chess match.  Fun to play, fun to watch, but you would NEVER assume a computer was on one side of the games.  So the good news is I succeeded in the human-like play.  The bad news was my approach wouldn't be adding meaningful new theory to how to build a better chess program.

Of course, the other piece of good news was I now had plenty of first-hand direct experience in how counter-intuitive the behavior of such complex programs can be.  No hobgoblins here -- just several thousand lines of Fortran 77 code and a lot of simple algorithms to try to deeply analyze a relatively small number of positions (for a computer program).

It's too bad many people confidently assert they are experts in things they know little about.  Whether it's computer chess, climate  change, economics, or the nature of reality (i.e. religion) -- people often think they are right and those who disagree must be wrong. Thus the paranoia and the accusations.  IBM being less clandestine in (presumably) protecting their intellectual property after the match by disclosing the logs would have (perhaps) helped.

Disclosure: I was a tournament chess player, ranking roughly in the top 10% of US players when I stopped playing tournament chess.  I was an IBM mainframe database systems programmer for most of my career at IBM, but I had nothing whatsoever to do with Deep Thought or Deep Blue, aside from watching the matches with great interest and reading about the programs like many other computer and chess geeks.",1387238400,,4491,4.74002574002574
8016005,3,B0001P1BM0,"Not that I like to name drop, but I used to play basketball with Yasser Seirawan occasionally.  I was surely smart enough to not play him at chess.

Even if I would have been stupid enough to play chess with Mr. Seirawan, it never would have happened.  When I saw him playing at tournaments in Seattle, I believe that he was most likely already a Master at 17, while I was maybe a 1400 at best, and several years younger.  But he always seemed to be a nice guy to me, at least outside of the chess board.  If I walked by and nodded, he would mostly nod back, when he wasn't looking 10 moves deep to crush his opponent.  Head in hands, by the way. . . .

And this was the best part of the film for me, at least from what I remember, having watched this disaster-film-in-the-making about five years ago.  I just watched ""Computer Chess"" which was a far inferior film -- one that I took a beating for when I beat it up with a 2 rating -- and so I decided that I needed to rate this film as well.

I won't watch it again, but that's not because of Mr. Seirawan.  I just thought that Garry Kasparov went off the rails here, nearly as much as the far-superior Bobby Fischer did 20 years or more before.  It's just that Mr. Kasparov, if he does have a huge IQ -- like everyone seems to believe -- would realize that chess is ""easy"" for computers.  Sure, the game space of chess, when compared against the number of atoms in the Universe, is probably larger.  However, you, or more importantly the computer, doesn't need to open that entire game space to play; even the great Bobby Fischer couldn't do that.  You just need to prune the tree enough, and compute fast enough, to ""see"" what's logical.  And that's what Deep Blue did in this tournament.  ""He"" just could calculate so fast that Mr. Kasparov had no chance, and ""he"" Deep-Blued Kasparov.

A big recommendation for Mr. Seirawan, not only because I'm biased, but because he's added quite a bit to the world of chess since he was that young upstart from Seattle.  But a mild pass on ""Game Over"" to me, unless you want to see a grown man from Russia cry.",1381795200,,2102,4.265151515151516
8016006,5,B0001P1BM0,"If you love chess you have to see this fascinating conspiracy theory film. Didn't you ever wonder how an IBM computer beat a brilliant human player like Kasparov?

It's a quirky, obtuse film unlike anything I've ever seen before, full of unusual facts & deep insights into the realm of ultra intelligent people, which you and I are probably not.
