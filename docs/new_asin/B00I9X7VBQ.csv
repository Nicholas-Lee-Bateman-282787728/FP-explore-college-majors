8640262,5,B00I9X7VBQ,"Fantastic, amazing audio, but a few things you need to know.
1. 100% Francophone,  no other language for subtitle or audio (for audio this is a good thing).
2. Fine print on the inserts and sleeves is not too sharp.
3. Comes with DVD and Blu-ray, mine did not have a promised separate DVD-sleeve.

I really enjoy watching this, and it helps my daughters with their French.",1425600000,5,372,4.537313432835821
