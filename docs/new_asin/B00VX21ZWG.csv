7113236,3,B00VX21ZWG,"We enjoy Sebastian. He makes us all laugh, and we have appreciated that his humor is relatively clean. This particular performance is not as funny as ""what's wrong with people?"" but is still quite entertaining. One minute of the performance, however, disappointed us enough that we disposed of the DVD after watching it. Sebastian is talking about the way people give friends a tour of their home. When it comes to the master bedroom, he mentions that this part of the tour is quickly glossed over as the friends receiving the tour think ""This is where you f***?"" We really wish that crude and demeaning sentence had not been included in Sebastian's performance. We're not prudes; we think marital intimacy is wonderful. We won't be sharing this DVD with others, and are hoping Sebastian's ""Live"" DVD will be more like the first one we bought. Were it not for that one disappointment, we would have rated this a four-star.",1480809600,,922,4.80503144654088

7113365,4,B00VX21ZWG,"It was through his half hour special on Comedy Central that I first discovered Sebastian Maniscalco. It's tricky for me to describe his humor (beyond the words ""witty and sarcastic""), but between his Italian/Brooklyn accent and the way he tells a story always leaves me crying with laughter. He's not overly raunchy like Dane Cook, nor is he super mellow like Demetri Martin. He's not a total dork like Brian Regan, nor is he a country bumpkin like the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. This is a guy who seems to have been born and raised on the city streets--just trying to play it cool and keep up with the times, while also lamenting over the fact that the world has changed drastically since he was a kid--for better or worse.

In this special, Sebastian talks about a wide range of topics, from growing up with a hard working, Italian family, to the ups and downs of being married, to the struggle of ordering a burrito at Chipolte. His stories are completely relatable, while also pointing out the weirdness and stupidity of both modern technology and people in general. Some of my favorite bits include his family's solution to getting rid of household pests; his stance on airport security, and how to get rid of burglars via a bow and arrow.

To say any more would be to spoil the whole show. You'll just have to give him a watch and see for yourself...then lose your breath from laughing. It's a shame, as well as a mystery, as to why his name isn't as well known as the above mentioned comedians, because he's arguably just as funny; maybe even funnier. It's time he got the recognition he deserves. Give his specials (including this one) a listen; you won't be disappointed.",1463184000,4,1678,4.608695652173913

7113429,5,B00VX21ZWG,"Sebastian Maniscalco - A Genius Conductor of orchestrating LOL!

In 2016, the World of Comedy is filled with Ethnic humor, Improv, Open mike, Lewd, Roasts, Stand-up, LGBT, Urban, Racial Insult, and other genres.

Whereas, Sebastian has created his own genre with a perfect G-Rated formula that Stands Up on its own and does not rely on artificial sweeteners.

A huge fan of Sebastian since 2009, it became obvious that this is a well-orchestrated comedy event from someone who is a master and surgical observer of the Human Condition, as it relates to our interesting home and public behavior patterns.
While at the same time reminding us of his immigrant family, which most Americans hail from but have lost sight of their own immigrant family at the entry port of call NYC location, named Ellis island.

Maniscalco is a master Story Teller, who has a brilliant ability to turn on and off his facial, eye animations and body movements in a subtle manner that not only amplifies his character, but, elevates his comedy to a Shakespearean level.

Yes, he is a pure Genius, because this ACT demands real Brain Power!
Sebastian creates, writes and produces his own comedy material.
His keen observations of every-day typical human behavior and interactions, are so superbly-crafted that it leaves you hungry for more.
His Real Comedy material is so profound that you find yourself identifying and drawn into his genius Story lines, and watching it again.
Ive watched all three videos over and over again ... Yes they are all that 5-Star good, and cant wait for the next one.

In one of my favorite movies, Gladiator, played by Spaniard (Russell Crowe), would stand in the center of the Colosseum, before the cheers and accolades from the Public and shout back ... Am I Not Entertaining? ... it is what Sebastian does but within a more refined, subtle delivery of impeccable note. Ciao!

I preordered this DVD and was looking forward to finally watching it and laughing my a$$ off. We recently invited friends who've never seen him, popped in the DVD and much to my surprise, it was a total disappointment - the material was way off and surprisingly vulgar for a clean comedian. He rarely dropped F-bombs in older acts, never mind MF-bombs but here they were. I'm guessing he was asked to be ""edgier"" (meanwhile his clean cryptic observations made him who he is) . I had teen kids in the group and cringed through the vulgarity and I was embarrassed that I raved about him as he just wasn't that funny.

I would highly recommend buying ""What's Wrong With People"" and hope Sebastian goes back to the formula and material that brought him his well-deserved fame. Hope this isn't the downside of a very talented entertainer. Not as funny and vulgar after he got married - hmmm",1440892800,2,1072,4.6421052631578945
