8637792,5,B00I09AZ2G,I waited a while for vol 3 but it was well worth the effort. I saw a lot of what Jerry talks about in his Melodic Rhythms book and Ive been taking the exercise into a practice room with a pianist and we trade some of the rhythms over tunes. I think its really helped develop my understanding of pre-hearing something before I play it. This is the toughest video but the rewards are worth it.,1402790400,,391,4.157894736842105
8637793,5,B00I09AZ2G,Jerry Bergonzi is one of today's greatest Jazz saxophonists and improve teachers.  This time around Jerry focuses on rhythm and how to practice and find more rhythm in to your playing.  Like the previous DVD Jerry has his old student Brian Levy to be try the exercises Bergonzi discusses and ask follow up questions.  This DVD will help develop your time and help you move in to polyrhythms.  Displacing rhythms for me is a great way to take your current Jazz vocabulary and turn it into new material.  If you have Bergonzi's previous DVD's or his books this book on rhythm will be a prefect combination.  If you're studying Jazz improvisation Jerry Bergonzi's teaching materials are a must have and the DVD's are the best way getting to hear Jerry explain and demo them.  The Jazz Heaven series of DVD's are best thing to happen to Jazz education in years especially Jerry Bergonzi's series.,1402617600,2,892,4.753246753246753
