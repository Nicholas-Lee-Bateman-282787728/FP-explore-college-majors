8713624,3,B00WJ9YY7K,"The main conflict of this film is that Daigoro is hungry and the government is having problems funding his food supply. He has been in the care of the government since his fire breathing mother was killed by the military in what is actually, in my opinion, is the movies best scene (a city destruction scene). The other conflict that arises is another giant monster appears off the shore of the island Daigoro is inhabiting in a really cool entrance scene during a lightning storm. That monster, Goliath, has the ability to change the weather and the two monster fight in two, not so exciting, fist fights. In certain moments, there are excellent cinematography and sound effects. Overall Daigoro vs. Goliath is a silly, light-hearted kaiju movie with some good scenes and some goofy monster designs.",1470528000,2,800,4.889705882352941
