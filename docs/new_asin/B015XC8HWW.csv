8734929,4,B015XC8HWW,"Yet another 1930s film that I first saw on TV in the 1950s.. It was the first time that I had ever seen ballet on film and the first time that I had ever seen the great John Barrymore. My mother, who used to watch these movies with me and gave me my first background knowledge of them, explained who he was and that he had two famous siblings Lionel & Ethel. While I would later see many other John Barrymore vehicles including this film's precursor SVENGALI, it was over 40 years before I had the chance to see THE MAD GENIUS again and that was on a converted Region 2 VHS tape. Now I have it on this MOD disc from the Warner Archive Collection and it's a real treat.

John Barrymore plays Ivan Tsarakov (love the name) a vagabond puppeteer who rescues a young boy from his brutal father (Boris Karloff before FRANKENSTEIN). He trains the young boy to become the ballet dancer he never could be because of a club foot. They both become very successful with Barrymore turning into a dictatorial impresario much like Anton Walbrook in THE RED SHOES. Both are based on the real life head of the Ballet Russe, Serge Diaghilev although GENIUS predates SHOES by 17 years. This film was done as a followup to the earlier SVENGALI which also featured Barrymore and Marian Marsh.

The story is basic and would get recycled many times. Gifted dancer Fedor (played by Donald Cook and based on the great dancer Nijinsky) leads his ballet troupe to international acclaim under the guidance of tyrannical impresario Barrymore. When Fedor falls in love with a young dancer in the troupe (Marsh) everything goes to hell in a handbasket leading to a bizarre and horrific finale. The movie was directed by a pre-CASABLANCA Michael Curtiz and is full of German Expressionistic touches. Supporting turns by Charles Butterworth and especially Luis Alberni (also from SVENGALI) as a drug addicted choreographer add to the mix. Not a great movie but an extremely memorable one. Highly recommended for fans of Barrymore and 1930s pre-Code cinema.",1503014400,2,2023,4.711864406779661
8734930,5,B015XC8HWW,"This film is a wild and wooly Art Deco follow-up to John Barrymore's Svengali. Having it on DVD makes it possible to catch all the hysterical nuance, because one can re-view scenes.",1457222400,4,181,4.6875
8734931,5,B015XC8HWW,"I rate this movie a ""5"" because it features a masterful performance by John Barrymore. He is sober, focused and charismatic and  demonstrates acting of the highest quality. Marion Marsh is quite young and beautiful as she and the supporting cast are adequate but not memorable. The movie itself is just an uneven studio concoction, but Barrymore transcends.",1456790400,5,357,5.155172413793103

8734933,5,B015XC8HWW,This is much better then the earlier released Svengali Barrymore is his usual best. I have waited a long time to see this film and i was not disappointed.,1448150400,8,154,4.344827586206897
