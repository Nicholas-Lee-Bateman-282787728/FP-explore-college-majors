6254376,4,B00I9BU3M2,"Typical film noir outing, pretty good. As always Charles McGraw is either the hero or the heavy!",1411948800,4,96,4.705882352941177
6254377,4,B00I9BU3M2,Decent image quality on this one and a pretty good movie. If you don't set your sights too high you'll have a good time.,1409961600,9,120,4.041666666666667
6254378,2,B00I9BU3M2,"Neither Charles McGraw nor Joan Dixon were A-list screen actors, so we start with a negative. Then you add that neither of them are particularly attractive and you ask yourself, ""Why did I purchase this?"" Or ""Why am I looking at this?"" The story was trite and time-worn as well, so it's an overall loser.",1407888000,2,304,4.545454545454546
6254379,5,B00I9BU3M2,"PLOT: Charles McGraw falls for a bad girl and sets out to give her wealth no matter what.

McGraw is honest insurance investigator living on $350 a week. On a plane ride he meets and falls very hard for lovely ""bad girl"" Joan Dixon. She wants mink and diamonds. They part ways and then McGraw runs into her again clad in a MINK COAT and is the new lady love of crook WEBB. The couple fall in love and McGraw draws up plans using insider info from the insurance company he works for to commit a robbery. He recruits WEBB to get the job done. When McGraw and Dixon marry and go on the honeymoon their ""share of the loot"" arrives via the mail. Soon McGraw is suspect in the robbery and the couple are on the run....McGraw is always good as the good guy gone bad for the wrong woman....Dixon is excellent as the bad girl....with an eye for mink. Good plot and holds the interest. 5 STARS",1393632000,23,883,4.224852071005917
8640079,4,B00I9BU3M2,"A true noir classic where sex and money lead to the downfall of a decent man. Just goes to show you that if a lady is willing to chisel a little money out of TWA, she can't be trusted no matter how good she may be in bed.

Low budget -- check out the switch of cars before, during and after the fiery crash -- presumably the film crew had to get that rental back before over charges kicked in.

Entertaining with all the elements of a more expensive noir icon.
