8686576,2,B00P6P3N4Y,"There are some interesting moments in this video. But the contention , in the very words of the voice over narrator, that Serra was bringing a worldview consistent with ""the Enlightenment""  (again the exact words!) is really pretty funny. Serra's viewpoint was much more in line with Counter -Reformation assertions of natural sinfulness than with any Enlightenment notion of a ""noble savage"". Apparently this video is trying to have its cake and eat it conceptually. Thus it seems to be a sleight of hand, a deception. It is particularly amusing that this video which is being shown on a Catholic cable station which bad-mouths the Enlightenment  at every turn is trying to glom-onto it to justify Serra's tactics.",1435881600,,715,5.0508474576271185
