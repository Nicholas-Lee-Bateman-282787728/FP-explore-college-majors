8506901,5,B006ZDKK42,"Anyone into making rubber monster mask needs this video. The materials recommendations are worth the price alone. Heck they are worth twice the price. (You really want to get the type of paint he uses here. Its wonderful stuff.)

One warning: this is a DVD+R. My blu-ray player had a hard time with it. The only way i could get it to play the entire disc was to go to the ""chapters"" menu, and selecting chapter 1. Once i did that it played the entire disc without interruption. However, the information contained within was well worth this minor hassle.

I plan to purchase more of the SWSCA DVDs. If they are anything like this one they will be incredibly helpful.",1370649600,,665,4.533333333333333
