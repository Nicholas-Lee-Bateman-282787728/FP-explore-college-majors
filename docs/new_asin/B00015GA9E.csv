1971490,5,B00015GA9E,"The workout is fun and finish before you know it. You get so into doing it, watching your breathing and paying attention to your powerhouse that the time flys by. Kristin McGee is the best Pilates instructor I've seen so far. Only little thing... I need to stretch a little bit more before and after workout. Otherwise I LOVE it!!",1078272000,,330,4.516666666666667
1971491,4,B00015GA9E,"I recently bought 3 workout videos to try and this one is the easist to follow and doesn't beat your body up,but boy can you feel the results the next day. Very good for someone who hasn't worked out in awhile. I had trouble with the other videos keeping up with the workout but not this one and I wasn't TOTALLY exhausted afterwards and I can feel the effect the next day. I will recomend this to my daughter who just had a baby about 9 months ago.",1073779200,24,449,4.113636363636363
1971492,3,B00015GA9E,"this is a good introduction to pilates and about as good as you will get without going to an actual pilates studio and using their various machines.  the instructor kristin mcgee is probably the best one operating on video these days. the workout is lengthy enough that not only will your abs get a workout but your whole body should derive at least some aerobic benefit.
what concerns me is that there are many forward bending-type  movements that require particularly limber hamstrings and if you're not loose in the back of the leg you run the risk of hurting the lower back.  there's nothing offered here that will reduce that risk like, for example, a simpler way to do the pose specifically targeted at minimizing the risk of hurting your lower back. at a minimum, it would make sense to do some warm up and stretching of the hamstrings before doing this program.",1073692800,37,869,4.666666666666667
1971498,5,B00015GA9E,"I started this dvd about a month and a half ago. Take it from someone who has never done pilates, or yoga, this dvd does work. It takes time, and you should start out slow, 3 times a week for me (and yes, the first time always sucks). But now I'm doing it everyday with ease. Kristin McGee is an awesome instructor. She shows you how to do the harder moves as one of selections on the dvd, and you have a choice of doing beginner, intermediate, or expert versions of the workouts. An excellent choice for pilates beginners. I recommend trying out Kristin McGee's Weight Loss Pilates when you feel confident your core is strong enough, but be prepared to feel the burn!",1334275200,,668,4.395161290322581
1971499,5,B00015GA9E,"This DVD hasto be the best pilate workout.  Kristin McGee is very thorough and knowledgeable about all the pilate moves.  And her voice is not annoying, like some instructors, it is pleasant and relaxing.",1327968000,,204,4.970588235294118
1971500,2,B00015GA9E,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

pros: Overall, I at least worked up a mild sweat.  Instructor counted pretty much the whole way through which was a nice change (vs just relying on following the beat of the music.)  Overall, second routine was better than the first, and bonus routine was better than either real routine with just the instructor doing (what seems to me) more traditional pilates moves.

cons: Totally frustrating camera angles were a mess and prevented you from seeing what you needed to see.  At one point, they focused on people's hands(!) --- totally pointless --- or partial shots of people so you couldn't see the full pose.  Instructor facing forward was just not helpful either and the multitude of people in the back were just distracting.  They tell you to watch W for easy and X and Y for intermediate and Z for advanced.  Totally confusing.  Would have been better off color coding their outfits and putting a legend on the screen or something.  The first routine felt like it was all poses facing down which made it pretty impossible to watch the screen (probably why she had to count throughout) but most of the moves were good and after doing the routine a few times it probably wouldn't matter.  There were too many useless moves interspersed in the harder moves like bicep curls or moving your arms overhead or behind.  For myself, unless you are in physical therapy or something, I find those totally pointless, or you would have to pick up some weights to make it worthwhile (this workout does not require any equipment.)

So glad I got this from netflix instead of buying.  Not a keeper.",1286841600,7,1646,4.70979020979021
1971501,5,B00015GA9E,"I swear by this video. It transformed my body and my mind. I take it with me on vacations even. Kristee and friends outside Pointillo Mountains or whatever they are called? LOVE it. So beautiful. I've been using this since 2006. Haven't found a better pilates video yet. McGee is easy to understand and follow. Plus they give you three different levels to chose from. I love McGee's story by the way. Came to NYC to be an actress, sounds like it didn't pan out, so she turned to making fitness videos. But I recently saw her in a 30 Rock and was like you go girl! She got the gig thanks to training Tina Fey. See, in New York all your dreams can come true.  Anyway, bottomline: great video.",1283385600,,690,4.3076923076923075
1971502,4,B00015GA9E,"Wow, that Kristin McGee is in TOP SHAPE!  She never even breaks a sweat the entire time during the workout session!  This DVD focuses on core strength through combination of pilates and yoga moves.  The two sessions offer core and arms, or core and legs.  Kristin and her team offer easy, intermediate, and advanced forms to try this workout so you will never get bored!  Kristin, unlike many exercise dvd personalities, is NOT annoying and is easy to follow. My fiance and I tried this the other day and we both FELT IT the next few days.  I believe that if you did this as Kristin McGee suggests 3-4 times per week, that you will see results in 2-3 weeks time, but you will FEEL results right away! She really gets you to use core muscles you didn't know you had!  I think this would be a great supplement to a cardio and weight lifting routine if you truly want to reshape your body.",1268784000,,886,4.365853658536586
1971503,4,B00015GA9E,"I like this DVD because I am definitely a beginner.  I can't even do all of the beginner moves.  However, it allows you to improve by also having an intermediate and advanced person to watch on the DVD.  I feel like I am getting my money's worth from this product.",1258329600,,264,4.24
1971504,5,B00015GA9E,"I am a daily exerciser and do pilates once or twice per week.  I found this work out to be very well done.  The instructor, Kristin McGee had good form, showed variations for beginner, intermediate and advanced exercisers and was not too ""chatty"".  I like that, show me the exercise and let's just get on with it!  She incorporates many of the classic pilates moves, such as the teaser, the mermaid, rolling like a ball, roll-overs and some other moves that are ones I was not familiar with but were good stretches.

I enjoyed the workout and felt like as an intermediate exerciser in Pilates I could follow the moves and still felt challenged.  I would caution if you have NEVER done Pilates to try a beginner dvd to start off with or one that illustrates the beginner versions more clearly (Mari Windsor's videos are good in this area as you can see all three exercisers clearly in frame). Also, if you are not so flexible in the morning, be careful with moves such as the roll-over where you are pushing your legs back behind your head.  You may find yourself not as flexible at some points of your day and may need to modify or cut this part out.  As someone already familiar with Pilates I found this to be a good dvd and I also enjoyed the outdoor setting at the Pointe Hilton in Phoenix, AZ.

The dvd runs 39 minutes and is a perfect length for a lighter work-out day.",1248825600,,1375,4.403162055335969
1971505,4,B00015GA9E,"I had a beginner's tape that was not doing anything for my body.  However, when I purchased this workout and began using it, I also began noticing results.  It runs about 30 minutes and hits most of my muscle groups.  It is especially effective for the thighs, abdomen, and buttocks.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a beginner at pilates.",1235088000,,345,4.516129032258065
1971506,4,B00015GA9E,"I borrowed this from a library & will be buying it. I just started working out after a long break. The 1st time I didn't even do all the exercises & the next day my stomach & butt muscles felt slightly sore. I did the whole dvd & some of the moves were hard to do all the reps or have the correct form (ie Legs completely straight while laying on my back & having them up in the air), but that's why I'm a beginner. If I do this regularly, I know I'll stretch out & get in better shape.  Also, you have the option of turning off the music OR turning off the instructors voice OR hearing both instructor & music. The reason I gave it 4 stars: the camera angles aren't the best -- you can't always see the modified positions (watch the dvd before hand so you have a clue), a little more stretching would help, you can watch some of the exercises at the end of the dvd, but she should recommend watching them before you start.",1210982400,,923,4.071428571428571
1971507,3,B00015GA9E,"I really do enjoy the actual workout performed in this DVD.  There were some traditional pilates moves (the hundred, series of five, saw, etc) but she also added variations to other moves.  And three levels of intensity are shown which was really nice.  One draw back was Kristin's continual ""coaching"" thru each move which tended to be a bit distracting.  Through each move she would say ""inhale up, exhale down, inhale up, exhale down"" and so on.  It would have better if she didn't do that each time and threw some other sayings in there instead of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, etc.",1205971200,,588,4.7254901960784315
1971508,5,B00015GA9E,"I hadn't worked out during my 4 years in college. I decided to buy this tape, based on good reviews and couldn't agree more. This video is perfect. You can start at your own level and make it more challenging for yourself as you get stronger. I feel more energized and my muscles feel toned and it definitely has reduced my stress level. Its been hard for me to be interested in working out, because I usually get bored. Not with this video. I do it almost every night before I go to bed. I can't get enough of it. Thank you MTV!",1199836800,,529,4.145631067961165

1971513,4,B00015GA9E,"I chose this video because it promised a full body pilates workout in just 40 minutes, and it delivered.  I'd always thought Pilates seemed pretty boring, but changed my mind after doing this video.  Kristin is a good instructor- relaxed and low-key, giving concise yet thorough explanations of each move and the corresponding breathing.  I also like that I can do this workout first thing after waking up in the morning and not want to go right back to bed,  ;)  Because it's an MTV workout I thought I'd mention music.  It's more like, ""music?  what music?""  You can barely hear it.  However, the workout is invigorating and goes by quickly.",1138752000,2,643,4.7207207207207205

1971515,5,B00015GA9E,"What is more important than that?  It is a great workout and the benefits you reap will be rewarding.  This video won't make you sweat like a traditional cardio workout but it will tone your body.  It is a great and an amazingly challenging workout!  With this video, you will begin to build muscle and that will enable you to burn fat faster and loose weight.  Plus, you will feel energized and revitalized when you to begin looking fit and toned.  Like any workout you need to put in a fair amount of effort (don't be lazy - try some of the advanced moves as you become more confident) and trust me you will sweat and elevate your heart rate.  I am a retired fitness instructor (of many years) and have always been fitness conscious.  Now into my early 40s I began finding it harder to maintain my weight even when spending  hr 4-5 times a week on a Stairmaster or treadmill.  Foolishly I began thinking that this would be enough to stay fit.  That workout philosophy didn't really work out well.  I was burning calories but not building muscle and unfortunately, the older you get the harder it becomes to maintain muscle (which is key).  It was very discouraging as I put on weight and began to notice that although I was diligent about getting in a cardio workout things began to sag i.e., upper arms and my mid section grew.  On a vacation run with my very fit and extremely ripped sister-in-law (same age), I discovered that she prefers Pilates over any other workout.  Still an instructor herself, she now only teaches or takes Pilates.  She looks unbelievable!  It makes sense but I hadn't really even considered it.  I was just chalking it up to she had a better metabolism.  She was doing everything right and although I was doing something it I really wasn't enough.

It might be hard to give up the notion that you didn't always need a cardio workout.  But consider this . . . currently I am using this Pilates video along with two other Pilates videos (and I just added a Yoga video too). I still mix it up sometimes with the Stairmaster/treadmill and bike (not often)but if I choose cardio workout over Pilates I always include the ab section of one of these videos.  I try to invest 5 days a week.  The results 3 months later have been very rewarding.  I feel better, sleep better and I definitely look better.  I have lost weight and the best part is my tummy . . . I can't pinch an inch.  That is a feeling I haven't had in about 10 years.  I like it!!

I hope I have inspired you.  Good luck.  Get the DVD and get to it.",1125273600,13,2539,4.363247863247863

This one is a little less strenuous than her New York-based workout, but still moves quickly with good instruction.  I'd like to see more by the MTV crowd!",1124064000,2,298,4.60377358490566
1971517,5,B00015GA9E,"I've been doing pilates for 5 years and LOVED this DVD. Initially, I was wary of the MTV production. I guess I was fearful it would be watered-down or raunchy. I was so wrong. Kristen McGee is very likable & gives great instruction.",1122508800,,232,4.4186046511627906
1971518,5,B00015GA9E,"For me this video has made a major impact in my life. I first started this with my sister-inlaw pam, and discovered that it was for me. I was a special case because I had just dislocated my left kneecap. I needed something else to do besides the regular impact cardio workout. It was such a relief to find something I could do and had fun doing. I could imediately feel the burn! A few weeks later I dislocated my other kneecap and once again used pilates a stress reliever. I have noticed a great, huge difference in my abs, thighs, inner thighs,and my arms. I think that all the MTV pilates and yoga routines are the greatest and most energizing tapes! Lets work our abs!!!!",1118188800,2,676,4.373015873015873
1971519,5,B00015GA9E,"Hard to believe but true. Between taping  the Tom Green Show and Jackass they managed to put out a very nice pilates tape.

I've been doing very basic yoga as theater warm-ups for at least 3 years now and this was a very easy transition to make into this pilates. I would recommend a basic understanding of yoga/pilates. Kritstin doesn't explain many of the beginning moves (although she does in Yoga, and Power Yoga).

She is a *great* instructor. Compared to a lot of fitness tapes where the timing is off and the instructions are confusing, Kristin gets it right on. My main complaint would be with the camera man. The camera doesn't pan to the variations enough, and sometimes shows strange angles (or focuses more on a flower then the person).

It's really worth the money, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I'd also recommend MTV Yoga if you're just starting out, or MTV Power Yoga if you have a basic understanding of yoga (you don't really need them both they're more or less the same).",1117411200,,1006,4.572222222222222
1971520,5,B00015GA9E,"I think this workout is a gem...and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. It is led by Kristin McGee, she has 3 others doing the workout with her, Joy who does the beginner modifications, Jess who does intermediate and Kari, who along with Kristin does the advanced.  It is filmed in a very pretty
Arizona mountain setting adorned with colorful flowers.

This routine has more emphasis on abs than anything, but it has a good variety of pilates moves.  You will see all the basics, the hundred, rollup, leg circles, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, oblique criss-crosses which focus on abs, then there are some leg exercises such as frontal and side kicks, and other leg lifts.  But you will also see more difficult exercises such as the teaser, rollover, neck pull, open leg rocker, side planks and traditional planks. The saw, tick tocks (knee drops), spinal twists are other exercises you will see also. There is not a lot of time between exercises, you move through the routine quickly. Kristin gives great instruction though and lets you know when to inhale and exhale, which is helpful for those fairly new to pilates like myself.

There is some background music which you can hear but it is faint. I personally liked the music and thought it fit the workout well. There is an option on the DVD to pick either just the music or the instructor if you choose.  There is also a bonus section where Kristin will breakdown some of the more challenging exercises which is helpful.

Kristin McGee is an excellent instructor, she is pleasant, not overly perky but friendly and encouraging.  I highly recommend this video.",1113091200,7,1651,4.7282229965156795

I couldn't do everything on this dvd even at the beginning level, but it was still a great workout. I thought it moved at a good pace (not too fast) and I liked the different variations. Plus, Kristen isn't an annoying instructor! It is now two days later, and I am still feeling the effects in my abs. Definitely recommended!!",1107993600,,549,4.339805825242719

Positives: The instructor is likeable and cues well.  You can choose music on or off.  She moves at a good pace between poses.  The workout is short enough for busy people.  There are three people behind the instructor that are doing easier variations of the moves.  It's a perfect ""intermediate"" level.

There is a bonus ""step by step"" guide to the moves on the DVD.

Negative: You can barely hear the music.  I don't like the ""techno"" style music.  You can't see the people in the background that are doing the variations.

P.S. I think Pilates for Weight Loss by Gaiam is perfect for Beginners.",1093305600,2,731,4.373134328358209
1971523,5,B00015GA9E,"MTV Pilates is a strenuous Pilates practice led by certified Pilates instructor Kristen McGee.  It is filmed in an attractive outdoor setting, and Kristen works out with three helpers who show different levels of modification (beginning, intermediate, and advanced).  Once you get past the opening instructions, the actual workout is approximately 36 minutes.

At the start of the program, Kristen provides instruction on breathing while doing simple prep work for the abs area.  She then moves on to a series of classic Pilates matwork exercises, including the hundred, roll-ups, rolling like a ball, and the entire stomach series.  Kristen puts a unique take on the traditional Pilates workout by inserting some additional stretches before and after most of the movements.  She also includes some of the more advanced Pilates moves such as the rollover and neck pull, although she generally does less repetitions of these more difficult exercises.

Kristen completes all of the abs work (i.e., lying on your back) before moving on to the side kick series.  She includes a side plank to begin and also adds a walking leg movement to the end of the series.  She transitions with several more exercises specifically targeting the lower body as well as some back work performed lying on your stomach.  Kristen then returns to some further abs work with a modified teaser, spine stretch forward, and the saw, and the workout ends with a few short sets of Pilates push-ups and a brief stretch.

I have been practicing Pilates for several years now; I consider myself to be at an intermediate level, and I definitely felt challenged by this workout.  Although three levels of modifications are offered, the camera rarely focuses on the modifiers, and there are no alternatives shown for some of the most challenging exercises such as the rollover.  For this reason, I would not recommend this workout to someone brand-new to Pilates, especially since Kristen does not provide detailed instructions on executing the movements.  However, Kristen does cue very well, and so advanced beginners and others should have no problem following along.  I highly recommend this workout to anyone looking for an intense Pilates practice which will particularly work their abdominal area.",1090972800,56,2269,5.178082191780822

it is about 38 mins long, which much seem torturous at first, time flew by sooooooo quick i thought it was a 20mins workout.
I really enjoyed it, the setting, the instructor and even the background people were very pleasant (which is a lot to say about workout vids).
The workout itself has an abs section, and a short legs/buns section, and a short but great back section.
It does lack a long enough warm up, so i'd recommend to warm up first before starting this workout.
All in all the best pilates workout i've seen so far for NONE advaced pilates people.
I do pilates once a month (yeah i'm not an avid user but i do tae bo and run), and i could do this workout no problem.

1971526,4,B00015GA9E,"This video was my introduction into Pilates.  The reason I chose this video over others was the cost factor.  I was not disappointed with my selection.  MTV: Pilates offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced movements for about half the exercises (the other half doesn't matter).  All of the exercises were somewhat doable by myself.  However, any movement that required major hamstring usage proved difficult.  This, apparently, is the nature of Pilates, not the video itself.  I am very happy with the well roundedness of the exercises.  It is a good workout for my abs, hamstrings, and back.
I would like to give this video a 3.5-4. I fault this video for several reasons. First, there is not enough camera time on the beginner and intermediate models. I am a beginner after all. I would prefer to hit the angle button on my remote and see the desired model.  That is, after all, why there is an angle button.  Secondly, the authoring of the DVD is annoying. You must wait 43 seconds before the menu screen, 1:06 of various introductions in chapter one, and then only may you receive exercise instruction within that chapter. Even the scene selection for 'Warm-up' includes this 1:06 of introduction.  Put the exercise separate from the intro please!  True, you can use this time to stretch, but I would prefer to slap the disc in, hit menu on my remote, hit play, and then chapter skip to the first exercise.  If you have access to a DVD burner, do yourself a favour and remove the PUO's, therefore allowing yourself to skip the intro.
Total instruction time is ~36 minutes for the main video and ~5 minutes total for 8 in-depth position breakdowns.  There is a written description for the breakdowns, which is good.

Poor visibility of what the instructor/participants are doing so hard to ensure correct form, couldn't make it through the routine due to the dizzying camera work and won't reuse, so a total waste of money. If you're a fan of Kristin McGee, her Pilates Mix dvd is much better.

The pilates ones I've seen either require you to buy a bunch of DVDs and/or machine. Also any type of yoga that's not beginner seems too intense for me. This one I like because you don't have to have a lot of space in your home which is a problem for me. I'm extremely lazy so it's a workout that I can convince myself to do and it  makes feel better by giving me more energy throughout the day. I like that you're on the floor mostly and it could be done while half awake or with very little motivation and effort. It would be a good start for people who don't want to go to exercise but need to. It stretches your whole body and warms up a lot of major muscles and it works your core which helps with posture and balance. I also like that you don't need to buy anything extra except maybe a decent yoga mat. I know if I start doing this workout again it will be easier for me to kick-start a healthy regimen, especially with summer coming up soon.

8006653,4,B00015GA9E,"I like pilates/yoga, they not only help me to relax, but I get to work on my abs/muscles. I usually save these exercises for last. I do 10 minute
exercises, which is usually 50 minutes a day.  And believe me, every little bit helps!! Worth EVERY penny!",1404864000,,252,4.361702127659575
8006654,5,B00015GA9E,"I found this in the $1 bin at a discount store so was thinking it might not be that good.  It is a great Pilates mat routine with all the standard Pilates exercises, hundreds, the series of five, sideline series and back work.
I had practised Pilates for @ 10 years but stopped doing it about 8 months ago.  I was looking at a way to get back in and this DVD was it.  I know all the exercises but this DVD is a great introduction and reminder of those exercises.
Well Done!",1395014400,,473,4.064516129032258
8006655,5,B00015GA9E,"This is the best program I've ever tried!  A great introduction to Pilates.  It is challenging, but you can start by following the beginner level and work up to advanced.  Kristin explains the exercises very clearly and the transitions are perfect.  I saw results right away.",1388188800,,275,4.913043478260869
8006656,4,B00015GA9E,Beautiful setting.  Nice to be able to choose segments of the workout individually but couldn't mix and match.  Also couldn't get the extra demos to play.,1366848000,,154,4.884615384615385
8006657,1,B00015GA9E,"I'm an intermediate Pilates student teaching myself from home. I've been using Brooke Siler's video ""Pialates Weight Loss for Beginners,"" but wanted another routine for variety. This video claims that there are variations for beginners and intermediates, but a lot of the exercises beginners or intermediates should NOT do because they don't have the strength and control to avoid injury. Also, beginners don't have the endurance to go through a complete 50 minute workout. If you're advanced, then this might be a tool for you, but don't rely on her to teach you correct form to prevent injury.",1366243200,,595,5.081632653061225
8006658,5,B00015GA9E,"I was looking for a pilates DVD and was completely lost. A friend said anything by Kristen McGee would be great. I watched a few reviews and decided to go with this one.
I am rotating it every 3 days with my 30 Day Shred and Biggest Loser Cardio Max. I will say the first day I did it, I felt like I wated a little bit of my time. I didn't break a sweat. Not a drop. Some of the moves were complicated. But it all felt too easy....until later. About bed time I was feeling it in muscles I guess I hadn't been engaging as much with my other workouts. The next morning, I felt great!! I love the sore burn where you know you used your muscles! I wasn't too sore where I couldn't do my workout the next day though.
I really liked that there is a section of the DVD that Kristen goes over the actual moves so you can do them correctly. I wish I would have saw this before I tackled the DVD.
All in all......well worth the purchase!",1362700800,,927,3.989247311827957
