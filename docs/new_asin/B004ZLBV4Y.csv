4510346,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"This is an amazing and eye opening movie! It is worth every penny.  Everyone should see it and I totally believe churches should watch it. It's a great way to talk about the basics of Christianity with any group, young and old. The film is all about focusing on what the Bible says about different topics, such as alcohol and relationships, and applying it to one's life.

Three of the four actors from the movie (Alex, Will, and Michael) came to my college and showed the movie. They answered questions and hung out with us before and after the movie.  They're great guys with a passion for Christ and sharing what God showed them during their journey.",1324252800,108,653,4.564102564102564

4510365,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"Four college guys examine their Christian faith and discuss weaknesses of the American church -- so far, so good. But then, inexplicably, they set off for a lark in Europe to solicit opinions about moral issues from non-Christians. For example, what wisdom can someone hope to obtain by going to a public beach in Spain and speaking to young gals in swimsuits?

For anyone who really wants to know how to ""do church"", the answers are in the Bible. Read the Gospels to see how Jesus lived, read Acts to see what the early Church did, and read the epistles to get a biblical view on the very issues in question.

These fellows seem nice enough, and I really appreciate the questions they raised, but in discussing problems in the American Church, they might have learned more by raising their questions with American pastors and church members.",1414627200,,842,4.72108843537415

4510370,1,B004ZLBV4Y,If I had the option I'd give no stars. 4 nitwit college students go to Europe to interview other tourists? These kids have about as much intellectual curiosity as farm animals.

4510371,1,B004ZLBV4Y,"Let me start out by saying I am a 19 year old college student and a devout catholic. I appreciated the humor of the film but that is about all it had to offer. It lacked any depth or structure! I know high schoolers that have a more developed idea of faith than these guys. I think their hearts are in the right place but I do not think they were adequately prepared to make this sort of documentary. The entire documentary is them interviewing people about extremely basic aspects of Christianity (materialism, relationships...) I would warn against watching this movie if you are looking to deepen your faith in a meaningful way...it barely brushes the surface and makes Christianity look very cookie-cutter.",1399507200,,710,4.780487804878049
4510372,1,B004ZLBV4Y,"After a trying-too-hard-to-be-hip round of introductions, I got really excited about the premise of this movie. These 4 college guys, who had been immersed in a homogeneous American culture their entire upbringing, were setting off to Europe to challenge the faith of their upbringing from the perspective of those who were not indoctrinated into it, in this case a mostly secular Europe.

What a great movie that would have been.

Instead, these boys challenged none of the preconceived ideas they were taught. The biggest problem - which many of the glowing reviews on here will see as an asset - is that they never put the Bible down or leave their American worldview enough to actually perceive reality from a different perspective. Aside from some wild partying and sight seeing, they may as well have stayed home. This is the type of global travel that will appeal to the people from Waco and Dallas and other places mentioned in the film who aren't really comfortable outside the rather isolated culture they already know. To such people, checking off a few landmarks and preaching their culture counts as global travel.

Their interviews with people who allegedly have different views were very brief snippets that seemed more like a set-up to wink to their base back home (vulnerable high school kids still in the bubble of mental conditioning their upbringing created) and then condemn those people behind closed doors. They find comfort in talking to American tourists or a few others who share their beliefs. Such interviews are longer and go into deeper discussions not because anyone involved is right, but because this is the boys' comfort zone and they really aren't ready to move outside of it.

At one point, they are interviewing two average looking young people who they are almost sure will tell them what they want to hear about how it's okay to have sex outside marriage, when two Hasidic Jews walk right past in the background and the boys ignore them. Imagine what those devoutly religious people could teach these naive young men! Or imagine if they tracked down mystics or Buddhist monks or indigenous shamans who have gone to frontiers far beyond what any mega-church can offer.

When you experience people with those advanced insights, as I have, you are forced to really consider the laundry list of dos and don'ts that define much of ""religion"" today.

In another interview about alcohol, two interviewees say their Christian friends drink as much as everyone else but their Muslim friend abstains because of her faith. Rather than exploring why a Muslim might be living more ""biblically"" than these hard-partying college boys (yes, they party hard in the movie), the boy conducting the interview blows right past the comment and redirects her back to talking about Christians. Another missed opportunity for him to learn something.

At the Vatican, the depth of their exploration of Catholicism is to sit on steps alone and complain about the wealth of the Catholic Church. One of the more ignorant comments you'll hear is one of the boys actually saying Jesus didn't come to start a religion, which is ultimately true but, given their idolotry of the Bible they quote throughout, they fail to quote that part of the Bible where Jesus tells Peter to, you know, start the Catholic Church. Clearly, the ""Biblical"" learning they got growing up was selective - ignoring all the passages in the Bible that praise slavery, murder, rape, child abuse, incest, or Jesus requesting a church different from their own be started.

These guys are so naive to the world around them that one of them even says every older married person he knows claims to regret sex before marriage. I suspect most older people he knows have been conditioned into the same culture he proselytizes throughout. Most adults enjoy various sexual experiences before settling down; it makes their true love lives so much better.

Nevertheless, aside from the misleading deception at the heart of this movie, by which I mean these boys pretended to be open-minded then simply used the trip to proselytize the tired tropes they were raised to believe, these guys at the entry-level of spirituality do find a promising first step by the end. They have some decent insights about religion and its role. They recognize it's not about just following rules but rather about embodying a presence, and they make very apt criticisms of the faith of their upbringing.

Contrary to the conservative politics that have grown in recent years to dominate their cultural upbringing, they do seem to recognize a need to take care of the poor and that simple charity is not enough to do that on a sufficiently large enough scale. It would be interesting to see how that evolves into their future political views, as it stands in contrast to what most adults in their world believe (even the ones who receive public assistance).

That's all a good first step toward enlightenment. Perhaps it's not time yet in their spiritual journey to leave their idolotry of the Bible behind.

Hopefully, their next journey will actually address the original premise of this one. Hopefully they will drop the Bible that was compiled centuries after Christ with content voted upon by very powerful political men, release all they have been taught to be true, and immerse themselves in learning other spiritual traditions around the world, as well as the frontiers of science. Then, and only then, will they awaken to the mystical core of Christ, a wisdom that goes far beyond any text.",1393977600,3,5546,4.9388412017167385
4510373,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"So.  We have four affable, reasonably intelligent college students on their first trip to Europe.  Instead of using the opportunity to learn about other peoples, cultures and ways of life, they spend their time solipsistically questioning themselves about Christianity.  They talk about sinning (which means sex, of course), distinguishing themselves by their behavior, materialism, and a few other topics.  They talk about how they struggle and their difficulties with turning toward Jesus.  All of this on a trip to Europe where they don't do much learning about the countries they visit.  One kid can't get used to people speaking other languages!
At one point the kids DO fast in order to give the money to the poor, but overall, they are entitled Americans.  This would be fine if they weren't pretending to be virtuous.  Their carrying on about their great ""struggles"" and torments as Christians was just embarrassing to watch.
These would be nice kids except that they are so brainwashed by their pastors and Bible camp that they become self-centered monsters.
This is a good film for anyone who wants to see how Christianity deforms people's characters.",1391817600,,1161,5.138297872340425
4510374,4,B004ZLBV4Y,It was quite enjoyable to watch these college-age men travel to Europe to try to live out the things they read in the Bible. I would recommend this for church high school  or college-age classes to view and discuss.,1390608000,,215,4.512820512820513

4510379,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"I, a 34 year old woman, absolutely loved this movie. It's goofy, raw and so honest. Living in a college town and being a member of a church that spends a lot of funds to spread the gospel to them, I found this movie to be very refreshing. It's good to see it coming from that young perspective. As someone who is married with 3 girls it's a good refresher on how your mind works being a 20 year old. We have a tendency to forget as we get older just what it's like to be a young Christian trying to follow Christ in today's world.",1375833600,,530,4.009433962264151

4510383,5,B004ZLBV4Y,This film was an interesting journey for these young men to understand the meaning and practice of Christianity as seen through many eyes and understanding. What does it mean to be Christian or follow Jesus Christ?,1369612800,,214,4.972222222222222
4510384,1,B004ZLBV4Y,"This had to be the biggest let down I have ever watched.  It was basically watching 4 guys go around Europe, interviewing AMERICANS!!! (they went to Europe to specifically seek out different opinions), and acting like idiots.  They had no plan when they went (or it was such a failure that they scrapped it and went without it) which made it worse b/c we got to see a lot about how they were stuck without passports or missed the train.  Then there was the religious talk.  Very, very basic.  Sunday school stuff.  I felt like they were trying to do something mainstream enough to reach a big audience, but not tackle the issues too deeply so they didn't offend anyone.  All-in-all, a complete waste of time and money.  Don't buy it.  Don't rent it.  Don't watch it.",1366329600,4,766,4.525547445255475

4510391,4,B004ZLBV4Y,The first time I watched this video I didn't like it. Then again...  as a 43 year old black woman...I'm not part of the target audience. I watched it again with a friend and had a different experience with it. I watched it with some young people I know and really enjoyed it. I would watch it again with young people who'd never seen it.,1359158400,,337,4.184615384615385
4510392,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"This is a very modern, ""real"" look at what it means to follow Jesus as a young person in this culture we live in (American culture - this is definitely directed at the American audience). Basically you follow the real adventures of a group of 4 Christian college guys that went on a trip across Europe to discover more about what it means to follow Jesus. It's filmed by them as a sort of modern reality documentary.

The result is very engaging and fascinating. I would say this is pretty much a ""must see"" for any Christian young person aged 12 to 25 or so. Subjects like materialism/greed, entertainment choices, sex, even church itself, are covered in a way where you see both the guys themselves, and by extension, you the viewer, having to come to grips with what it means to live as a Christ follower in a way that the world sees you are different from them.

Not every thing the guys say or do is spot on theologically - you are after all watching a bunch of college-age guys trying to come to grips with how to live out their faith. I didn't agree with everything said, but it's all portrayed more as a ""dialogue"" - a ""discussion"" - and it is certainly great to promote discussion. This is something that I would say most every church youth group should consider showing their youth and then dialoguing with them about. In fact, I would think a great way to do it in this context would be to split up the different subjects that are covered and show each part that covers one subject - and then break for discussion. This could be done over a series of several weeks with each week being a different part of the film.

The title ""Beware of Christians"" is based on the premise that one of the most dangerous things in our world is Christians - or people who call themselves Christians anyway - living just like the world so that there is no distinction. The net purpose of this movie is to try to stir young people to examine themselves and make a commitment to live different as a follower of Christ.

As alluded to, the ideal age range for this film is in the jr. high/high/college age-crowd. Adults can certainly watch and get something out of it, but you will definitely not be confused that you are watching a bunch of college guys with their level of maturity (or lack thereof). Yet, the underlying themes and issues discussed are worthwhile for all ages. I personally don't care for the ""fake cussing"" which occurs throughout this movie where the guys say things like ""gosh darnit"", but this isn't a major issue with me and certainly I did a lot of that when I was in their age range as a Christian also.

Again, as a real-life examination of what it means to follow Jesus as a young person, this is a very helpful film and I know of no other one really like it out there.

4510399,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"To begin, I have absolutely nothing against Evangelical films that promote the Gospel.  I think the films of Alex Kendrick (""Fireproof,"" ""Flywheel,"" etc.) are quite good, tell engaging stories, and do a fine job of getting across the message that we desperately need Christ to atone for our sins and turn us toward Himself.  However, Kendrick had the good sense to write and film what he knows, setting his stories in and around Albany, Georgia, so his films have the ring of authenticity, a sense of place.

The biggest problem with ""Beware of Christians"" is that it tells us that these four wild and crazy lads are going to take a trip to Europe and come back changed, their faith challenged; this is an egregious case of false advertising.

I anticipated the worst when, early on one of the cast identifies the London Eye as Piccadilly Circus and describes Parliament as ""a bunch of Gothic buildings over there"" (Didn't any of these guys own a guidebook?).  Paris is reduced to a few shots of interviews at the base of the Eiffel Tower, Barcelona is portrayed as hedonistic beach town, etc.  Each of the cities visited serves as no more than fodder to provide a theme to the interviews (Paris=""materialism,"" Barcelona=""sex,"" Prague=""alcohol,"" etc.).  There is no more illumination in any of these ""man on the street"" interviews than in those of Jay Leno.  The only difference is, in Jay Leno's interviews, the ignorance of the interviewee is exposed; in ""Beware of Christians,"" the ignorance is on the side of the interviewer.

For true self-discovery (which is what the film purported to deliver at the beginning), there has to be a discovery of the Other, to be confronted with truths outside ourselves.  This is apparent nowhere in the film.  To visit these wonderful cities, so rich in history and culture, and to overlay them with a few talking points concerning correct Christian living, is not only a cultural crime, it is bad theology.  Our call in the world is one of redemption and reformation, and to do this there has to be some attempt at understanding a cities' history and culture, some recognition of how God is working particularly in the life of the city.  Without this, there is no reason the film should have been shot outside Dallas other than to provide scenic backdrops for the filmmaker's agenda.

I'm giving this two stars (though my inclination was towards one star) because I think these guys' hearts are probably in the right place.  But I can't get over the cringing induced by the willful cultural ignorance shown in this film, and the realization that this is probably fairly indicative of most Americans, Christian and non-Christian.",1355702400,2,2668,4.858719646799117
4510400,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"I am a nineteen year old college student. I love documentaries. I love Jesus. I really love travel. I don't really like most Christians. I saw this movie on Netflix thinking it would be perfect for me, yes! Other Christians who have hard feelings toward the organized religion that Christianity has become! None of my wishes were granted with this one.

 I didn't feel any connection to the four guys. I don't even want to go there with the poor film quality, and confused soundtrack, but the way the doc was carried out was just formulaic. I felt a sense of detachment from the guys because they were the epitome of the American Christian that they were against. One of them went to a Baptist college. BAPTIST. (He's the same guy who admits he makes fun of girls! Douche.) One of the most hypocritical branches of Christianity.  Are you getting me? I didn't see humility. There was no background of them at home for me to go off of. They didn't display the need for any change they brought to the table.

There were no real connections in Europe that I saw made that weren't condescending on their part.  They weren't respectful of their interviewees. They displayed their relationship with Christ poorly. I didn't feel engaged or enlightened in the least. Every point they hit has been hit before. The conversations were confused and uneducated. There wasn't a sentence spoken shy of a 'like' or 'uh'. I'm still confused about who the audience is supposed to be because non-Christians are being yelled at and Christians are being blasted for trying too hard.

I have no idea why they went to Europe when the majority of the people they spoke to were American tourists or English speakers. I felt like I was on a vacation with a bunch of frats who are into bro S&M (slapping each other unashamedly) and preaching to themselves when what the clearly need is a dose of reality. I got really tired of the sermons! It was never clear if they went to Europe to learn or to teach. Watching others learn lessons can be a teaching in and of itself. I felt they tried to hard to teach and ended up confusing the crap out of me! A Christ follower. The ignorance felt obvious and sometimes blatant.

In Hungary they go on a mission to help the homeless. I guess the idea was lost or edited out, whatever. But they sit around the table to talk it out. The conversation is again annoying. The guys of course bash American Christians who have money. They say that no one is doing anything except writing checks. People do write checks. But saying that no Christians actually get involved? I'm sorry; that is a lie. There are people who do wonderful things. People who chose to go to third world countries instead of a taking an across Europe trip-of-a-lifetime/ fratboy vacay.

I felt like whoever made this movie did not do enough homework regarding the spiritual connection of the cities.  I would have loved to see more local people studies, Anthony Bourdain type stuff. I would have really loved to see the intention of the film change in Europe, blossoming into a humble and meaningful realization. It stayed stagnant, though. I felt like I was on a vacation with people I didn't really like or agree with. The philosophy that the boys so eloquently profess (sarcasm) is similar to a dart thrown in the dark. None of the 8 or 9 points have direction, and nothing ever hits a bullseye. I don't even think there is a bullseye. Nothing ever goes anywhere and I couldn't feel much emotion.

The idea gets an A+. The execution, F. I gave it two stars because I think that this is a good idea for a documentary, but it needs folks who know what they're doing.",1355011200,6,3645,4.559633027522936

4510402,1,B004ZLBV4Y,"I watched this documentary on Netflix.  It is about these four American college students from the South who want to see how their faith is viewed by people who don't believe.  And I do mean their faith because these four young men had all sorts of judgmental comments about the people they interviewed who disagreed with them.  I stopped watching it after these men admitted that they had premarital sex.  It really bothered me that these men kept acting like they were better than the people they interviewed when they didn't even live out their faith.

I welcome listening to people who have all sorts of opinions even ones different than my own-this includes evangelical Christians.  When they judge non-believers and condemn them for their sinful behavior and they can't give up their sinful lifestyle, I stop listening.

This documentary was a great idea, but they should have put four men who really tried to live out their faith.  Then when they interviewed people who disagreed with them, show them being tolerant or explaining intelligently why they disagreed with them.",1354406400,8,1079,4.955555555555556

4510405,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"I read through many of the negative reviews and I must say I'm shocked that they don't get it.  This was an excellent program and I watched it with my wife and my 16-year-old daughter.  All of us loved it and highly recommend it.  We are sincere Christians doing our best to live a Christian life much like the guys in the movie are talking about.  The real point of the movie is that Christians need to live a life that stands out from the rest of the world.  These four college boys were honest and sincere, telling about their struggles but insisting that all Christians need to follow Christ even when its hard.  Though some people may get offended because they strike a nerve on all of those claiming to be Christians, but not living for Christ, they are speaking the truth about the majority of Christianity in America (and the rest of the world).  Some people complained because the guys seem extremely interested in girls.  Well, considering they are young college guys in their early 20s, what do you expect?  Of course they're interested in girls. But the movie in general promotes no sex before marriage, no drinking, no materialism, helping the poor and others, and living your life for Christ with a lot of humor. As for those who complained there was no suggestions on how to do this, well that was not the purpose of the movie.  This movie will best speak to teens and college kids about turning away from sin no matter how hard it is and making the serious decision to really start living your life for Christ.  It also talks about the necessity of really following Jesus as your Lord rather than just mumbling some simple prayer and thinking you're saved because of it.  No matter how much the free grace adherents want to argue, that is the real gospel message.  Jesus teaches it more than even the apostles.  Those who do not pick up their cross, lay down their life and follow him are not worthy of him.  True repentance is trusting in Jesus as your Lord and Savior.  This is their message.  Those of you who want to believe you're saved while still living your life in sin, that's your choice, but Jesus said he will tell those people, ""I never knew you, depart from me you workers of iniquity.""  Bottom line, this was a great movie if you really want something that is funny that will also force you to ponder how you are living your own life for Christ.  If you have a teen that thinks they are a Christian but are living a sinful lifestyle, this movie would be great for them.",1352073600,3,2500,4.454945054945055
4510406,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"I will preface this with the fact that I am an atheist.
The introduction to this film is misleading because the guys say they're questioning their faith when they are really focused on defining Christianity for themselves.  Their exploration is flawed since they interview primarily American tourists and other English speakers.  I disagree with some of their beliefs (i.e: Pre-Marital Sex/ Marriage is Between a Man and a Woman), especially the discussion of trying to sway non-believers to convert by doing good.
The overall message is still good that they're focused on becoming better people and focusing on the core of Christian values.  So meh, because I don't agree with a lot of their spiritual beliefs, but I'll give it 2 stars for working on being better, nonjudgemental people.",1351900800,,788,5.093023255813954

People look at Christians like we should be perfect but why would we need Jesus to die on the cross for us??? We are just trying to follow Him because we love and appreciates what He's done for us.

There  were  a  few  scriptural  gaffes,  but  it  is  a  movie  people  need  to  see.  The  downside,  is  that  it  has  a  great  appearance  of  being  very  amateur.

In the first movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Nation-Under-God/dp/B005SJ083W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Nation Under God</a>, the quartet drives all over the United States (and part of Canada) to find out what it means to be a Christian in today's culture.  They ask people they meet along the way what they think of Jesus and Christians.  The answers are quite revealing.  These vignettes are interspersed with their own musings, as they wrestle with what part of their evangelical upbringing is truly essential for following Christ, and what part is merely the trappings of the evangelical subculture.  Good stuff.

In this movie, Bakke and three friends (two are different than the first movie) do the same thing, only now in Europe.  They hit many major European cities on their quest for authenticity.  There is a great deal of soul searching, but also multiple instances of four college guys clowning around on a road trip, which adds some humor to the documentary.  The second movie lives up to the standard set by the first one, and in some ways supersedes it.

I recommend this movie for people who want to explore what it is like to live as a Christian in today's world--not the within the ""bubble"" of evangelical Christianity, but out there in the ""real world.""  Youth leaders will want to show this to their high school students before they go off to college.  Anyone who is interested in winning this generation to Christ will pick up important cultural clues, if you are willing to look at this through the lens of a missionary studying a foreign culture.",1349308800,10,1704,5.156363636363636
4510410,1,B004ZLBV4Y,"This documentary is trying too hard to be hip for the college student age bracket.  It's so blatant, it's ridiculous.  The guys in it themselves, start with the premise that they have ""doubts"" about religion and the way they apply it to their lives.  Supposedly they go to Europe to explore their Christianity in the eyes of others.  Instead, it passes off as judgmental of other people.  They seemed to process the information as if it was another college assignment where they already got half of the answer, and processed everything through their own given cultural filter.  Their interviews were very unsatisfactory.  The didn't speak other languages or bring translators, so they spoke to people who they already could talk to.

The next thing in my mind was, ""Oh great, more obnoxious loud Americans traveling to Europe. Reinforcing the stereotype.""  There are far more intelligent young college students who can talk about religion, philosophy, ethics, and transcultural issues without sounding like mindless frat boys.",1349049600,10,1026,5.2073170731707314
4510411,4,B004ZLBV4Y,Beware of Christians is a great movie! They bring up observations about the world and look at the Bible to see what God has to say about it.

They admit that they are as much part of the world and therefore see these problems in themselves too.

4510415,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"First, I'm going to admit that I do not fit the target audience.  I am way past college age.  I am a Christian who teaches college-age students at several local public colleges, and I've gotten pretty good at assessing what will interest college-age students.  This film might interest church kids, but I don't think there will be a broad appeal to my students.

Personally, I found the film boring.  After watching about 45 minutes, I spot-checked the film.  I caught the scene when one of the young men slapped the other on the back.  This came after the discussion on alcohol, which made me wonder if these guys had been drinking.

I caught scenes that showed the men taking postcards meant for a girlfriend and hiding them from one of their friends as well as the scene when the friend finds out.  Great friends.

The title, ""Beware of Christians,"" seemed like it was warning non-Christians.  The target audience for this film isn't non-Christians; it depicts non-Christians as foolish.  I usually teach in secular schools, and this would have no appeal for most of my students.  In fact, I think it would perpetuate the opinion they already have of Christians.

Instead, this appears to be an apologetic for ""right living.""  Although the film contends that the audience needs a relationship with Jesus, there's very little here to show us viewers how to establish that.

At the end of this film I was left with my hands held out, looking around and saying ""what the heck was that!!""  This documentary identifies several issues that Christians will face, especially younger Christians, but it doesn't really give answers to any of them! At times, I felt like this documentary was like a ""sinners anonymous"" group where ""Mike"" would stand up and say ""Hey my name is Mike and I struggle with lust"".  The problem is that neither Mike or anyone else in the group gives any good counsel nor scripture to directly answer the problem.

Indeed, it is undeniable that men will come across the temptations and issues that these young men did on their journey.  However; they faced their temptations with a lack of seriousness and, at times, they seemed to take pleasure in things that we are commanded to ""guard our hearts"" from.  I seem to recall that one of the guys was testifying that he loved to listen to Shakira.  Wow, what will literally happen because of that young mans statement is that a great majority of younger viewers will now think that it's okay to listen to secular music as long as their not letting it influence their life.  Viewers will also take that it's okay to fellowship with a non-believers in a manner that God would hate (drinking at a Beer Hall) and that would grieve the Holy Spirit. That it's okay to act like a drooling heathen when it comes to being in the presence of attractive women and that contemplating nude beaches is acceptable. Also, there was a scene where two of the guys slapped each other's backs so hard that it left imprints of their hands. I mean, for a second I thought I was watching the movie ""Jackass"".  Too, I am trying really hard to remember if I even heard the words REPENT and BELIEVE.  Two of the most fundamental commandments that we Christians are given. Nor that we are to ""love the Lord our God with all our heart, mind and soul"" - the great thing that we are to be about!  The young men in this film made the King of Kings and Lord of Lords little more than a footnote to satisfy their viewers and critics. Their way of life seemed ambiguously worldly, to say the least.

I am sorry to give such a harsh critique over a film that would seem to admonish, edify and even instruct new and young believers but it does little more than say ""it's okay to look and act like we do as long as you squeeze God in there somehow"".

My niece was the only one that thought it was a good movie but she is also the only one that is college age.

The concept was fabulous, the film just didn't live up to the concept.  Alot of good questions were asked, and struggles shown, but no real solutions. We all have struggles but I was hoping to use the film to help others find solutions to those struggles.

Having lived in both worlds, it's been my experience that American Christians tend to be more ""by the book,"" whereas European Christians tend to be more laid back (just my personal experience).

I don't know.  As a Christian mom whose teenage boys are borderline believers... I just felt that particular subject in the film was almost promoting sexual desire and hook ups as opposed to a good teaching on how to ""date"" as a Christian and properly deal with this issue.  There was too much 'interest' being presented in this film and not enough 'information'. This area is hugely important in the lifestyles of our youth, especially our boys, as nearly ALL television programs/magazines/and music push premarital sex sex sex into the faces of our kids.

4510429,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"If you haven't heard of the film Beware of Christians, I hope this review persuades you to check it out.  Their website and trailer were enough to peak my interest, so I took the risk and ordered a copy for my Campus Ministry.

Beware of Christians is a 93 minute film about four college students - Alex, Matt, Michael, and Will - who grew up as Christians, became somewhat disillusioned with America's version of Christianity, and decided to reexamine what Jesus had in mind to follow him.

They wanted to spend time away from the place where the majority of people believe, and go to a place where the majority of people don't believe.  Their adventure led them through Europe, visiting London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Budapest, Vienna, Munich, and Lucerne.

The opening scene of the film has the four guys sitting around a table, laughing and reminiscing about the trip.  Those table conversations serve as the common thread throughout the film, along with frequent individual time in front of the camera (in the spirit of The Office).

Along The Way

As you can imagine a film with four college guys would be, there's lots of footage filled with funny banter, practical jokes, wrestling, and talking about girls.  They stayed in hostels, got sick from the food, lost their passports, tried fasting, and made friends with homeless people.

There's also enough shots of impressive landmarks and beautiful scenery to make you want to buy a ticket to Europe yourself.

The conversations are the real meat of the movie.  The guys take on seven specific topics, each one complete with interviews from strangers and scriptures from the Bible.  Those topics are:

* Identity
* Materialism
* Sex/Relationships
* Church
* Wealth/Poverty
* Media/Entertainment
* Alcohol

I especially appreciated the way the film concludes with ""Seven Months Later"", as the guys ask each other, ""Now what?""

Some of My Favorite Quotes

* ""The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians who acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door and deny him by their lifestyles.  That is what an unbelieving world simply finds unbelievable."" ~Brennan Manning

* ""We ignore verses and highlight around it.""
* ""I spent most of my college life church shopping.""
* ""Extreme wealth is just as dangerous as extreme poverty.""
* ""We aren't going to reach people without going to where the people are.""

I give this film five stars, and heartily recommend it, especially to Youth Ministers and teenagers, as well and Campus Ministers and college students.  Whether your audience includes people who are Christians or people who are not, there is much to be gained by everyone.

Three Practical Ways To Utilize This Resource:

* Buy a copy for your Student Library (enabling individuals to watch it at home).
* Host an event for your High School group or College group (see website for details).
* Use in a Small Group (the DVD includes a Study Guide).

I should have suspected a trojan horse with a cover picture in front of St Peter's Basilica.  I found most discussions and topics acceptable to a Catholic audience. However, an unsupported and repeated claim that Jesus did not found a Church will not fly in Catholic circles.  Try to find that claim in scripture without ignoring direct wording to the contrary!

4510431,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"I've seen this movie three times, and each time it gets better. The first time I watched with some friends to spark a discussion about some of the issues college kids deal with but often don't talk about- you know, sex, drinking, materialism, etc. This doc not only supplied a lot of kindle for discussion, it also provided a lot of truth and frankness without being ""holier than thou"" or skirting around the issues. Very tactfully and very gracefully done. The second time, I watched it by myself to absorb, filter, and reflect on what they had to say. Again, it was a really awesome fountain of wisdom to draw from. The third time, I watched it with my college group. We haven't had the opportunity to discuss yet, but everyone's said how much they loved it and can't wait to talk about it.

In short, this documentary is near perfect for any setting: alone, in a discussion group, in a youth group, in a mondo lecture class. Doesn't matter. These guys are legit and present an honest and Gospel based perspective on hot topic issues that anybody (not just Christians) has to encounter at some point in their life.",1328745600,10,1116,4.58
4510432,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"This movie ""could have been"" a good documentary. The last great Christian documentary that I saw was ""The finger of God"". That was an awesome movie. This movie was POINTLESS. It had some funny parts in it, otherwise I would have given it only one star. The whole movie these guys kept bashing American Christianity, even though they themselves are Christians. Sure, American Christians are not perfect, but who is? They also made it sound like there were no good ""true Christian"" churches in America. I would say to that, NOT SO. There are some bad lukewarm Christian churches, but there are also MANY good, on fire, Gospel teaching, Jesus loving, Christian churches in America. One of them also was telling pastors that they need to ADD WORKS (adding full-surrender) to the Gospel message. I was screaming at the TV, NO WAY! If it is by grace, then it is no longer works. If it is by works then it is no longer grace. Please DO NOT CONFUSE non-Christians about the Gospel. Yes, the Gospel is clear, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that he died for your sins and rose again, in order to be SAVED. NOTHING ELSE. Yes, AFTER you do this and become Saved, then you should fully surrender your life in order to live more like Jesus. But do not ever mix SAVING GRACE, which comes only by BELIEVING in JESUS as YOUR SAVIOR (that He died for your sins and rose again); with works and fully surrendering. This might seem small but it isn't. What I saw in this movie is that there are many people out there in Europe that really could care less about God. And, this has nothing to do with Christians (as this movie leads you to believe). It has to do with the fact that these people simply don't care about God or anything spiritual for that matter, because the god of this world (satan) has blinded them. It is ridiculous to blame Christians for people becoming Atheists, as this movie leads us to believe.",1328659200,20,1899,4.507246376811594
4510433,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"For a long time, I have been thirsty for a film that I can show my non-Christian friends and say, ""This is what I believe.""

""Beware of Christians"" is, unequivocally, that movie for me.

For all skeptics, yes, this film is going to drop the ""J"" word, and encourage people to re-examine their lives and seek fulfillment in this way, but if you just give this movie a chance, I guarantee that you will discover one of the most accessible and human versions of Christianity that the medium of film has to offer.

Bakke and his team understand that the majority of modern Christian films double as worship for Christians. In other words, faith-based entertainment preaches to the choir and appears dogmatic to those outside of the bubble. This film represents an evolution in Christian film that is desperately needed in a media forum riddled with negative depictions of Christians and faith at large.

Honestly, this is the first Amazon review I've ever been compelled to write.

See the movie. You won't regret it.",1328572800,19,1012,4.793103448275862
4510434,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"This movie is very slow and comes across as more preachy than inspirational, could not finish the first half of the movie.",1326585600,8,122,4.590909090909091
4510435,2,B004ZLBV4Y,"After watching this movie, the biggest question in my mind is: Huh?  What was the point of the film?  I bought this expecting a film on the reality of following Jesus.  There was only a cursory treatment of some of the issues that the church faces (i.e. church-goers vs. Jesus-followers).  If I was a skeptic I could appreciate their honesty but there's nothing in it that would make me say ""OK I want to follow Jesus.""  I also found their discussion about the opposite sex distracting from the message of the film.  There were two positives however.  The second-to-last chapter (Lucerne Switzerland) contains the most profound statement in the film.  And it was pretty funny.",1325376000,18,676,4.817391304347826
4510436,3,B004ZLBV4Y,"When I bought the video I was not sure what to expect,although I was hoping it would stir up some deep conversation with my teenagers and college sons. (It did not). Pros- I found the 4 gentlemen entertaining and honest. I liked how they referred to Scriptures after they covered each of the ""hot"" topics such as Materialism, Sex, drinking, etc.  Cons- My fundamental problem with the movie is that it is that there were times when the boys didn't act very Christian in the movie (ie: postcards).  And it would be better if it showed American faith in addition to European faith, or better yet, faith around the world.  There were only a few very ""profound"" moments in this movie, otherwise it just showed what youth of today are thinking about God.",1325030400,66,749,4.616541353383458

Young adults to Senior Citizens- only $10 to have a great movie night to share with your friends, have a good laugh, and maybe learn something new. These guys did an amazing job!

I watched the beginning and was still unsure of how this movie would be. But by the end I fell in love with them, their message, and their application of what they learned!
I pray that they don't forget the blessings of that trip in their daily struggles!!",1477353600,,420,4.197530864197531
8450229,5,B004ZLBV4Y,"When I first started watching this movie I clicked out of it because you hear the word ""Documentary"" and you associate it with the word boring. Somehow I ended up watching it again the summer going into my senior year on Netflix and I watched it probably three times in a row picking it apart and writing down some of the stuff they said because it was so relatable and eye opening in many ways. It's great because I can come back to this movie and it speaks to me in one way or another because they hit on so many topics that are huge struggles in society and especially in college. They are a charming, funny bunch with good heads on their shoulders. And now that I am a sophomore in college I find it even more relatable. You should definitely give this movie a shot. The worst that could happen is you end up liking it or it ends up changing how you do life. :)

I have so many favorite quotes from this movie, this is just one of them:

The bottom line is that I am not perfect, and I am not gonna have all the answers and I screw things up all the time, but the crazy thing is that God loves me anyway. And despite all the crap that I do, He loves me. And that is crazy. And it is crazy that I am just now figuring out what that means.
