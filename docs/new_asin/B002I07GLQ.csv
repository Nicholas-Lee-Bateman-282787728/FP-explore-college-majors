8370609,5,B002I07GLQ,"I am a dancer.  Therefore a consistent pilates practice is essential to prevent injuries.  I love this program because it is challenging and keeps me strong.  I also like the emphasis on upper body strength.  That makes carrying multiple bags of groceries or lifting heavy boxes so much easier!  I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner since a beginner could injure themselves.  Some of the exercises are too advanced for someone new to pilates.  But I heartily recommend it for dancers, athletes, and seasoned pilates aficionados.",1468540800,,530,5.093023255813954
