5124352,4,B00834JQYG,"Danny Bonaduce ""stars"" as a Haley Anderson, a radio DJ in Deadwood, SD near Mt. Rushmore. If someone had told me Danny Bonaduce was really working as a DJ in Deadwood SD, I would have believed him. His Partridge Family gig provides the humor for Barry Williams, formerly of ""The Brady Bunch"" for being his arch rival in this film.

As man destroys the forest he encroaches on Big Foot's territory, who is about 50 feet tall. At times this production is ""King Kong"" spoof. Being near Mt. Rushmore, I think you know where this is going.

Bigfoot is aroused and discovering Allison Hayes is dead and 70's rock star Alice Cooper is alive and headlining an 80's rock festival causes him to go on a rampage. The movie has poor CG effects and should only be viewed in black and white, drinking your favorite adult beverage, and/or taking persecution meds in order to get the full 1950's SyFy feel. Lines such as ""Peter Pan never killed anyone unless they deserved it"" are meaningless sober even when spoken by Greg Brady.

POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS: There are some fun parts such as when Bigfoot scales Mt. Rushmore. Notice that in one moment he is up at Washington's eyes, and then the next moment he is climbing below his chin. Or the part when Bigfoot looks down and sees the pretty blond girl. He cocks his head back and forth like K.Kong eye balling Fay Wray, and then steps on her. Seriously. The film was a well made bad spoof.

Made for TV, no sex, f-bombs, or nudity.",1347062400,4,1466,4.5
5124353,4,B00834JQYG,"Well, I must admit I'm a little confused.  I've never seen any other movies from the Sci-Fi channel, so I'm not sure if their whole point is to compete to see who can make the most corny film with very poor acting, or if Big Foot was just a corny film with VERY poor acting.  If you are lucky enough to have a regular gathering of friends for ""bad movie night"", I'm not sure if telling you that my husband and I agreed this was one of the VERY WORST movies we ever saw would be a selling point or not.  Besides the very, very, very bad acting by every actor in the movie, Big Foot, who sort of looks like a cross between King Kong and a corpse, pops people's heads into his mouth like gumballs, and every human character in the movie is a doofus, which is enhanced by the lousy dialogue the actors spout out (or mumble out), and further enchanced by the very AWFUL acting.  The ending could not have been more ridiculous, which pretty much is what could be said about the entire movie.  At one point Big Foot gets part of his face burned off, but a few scenes later they show him with his face intact again.  The ""special effects"" were nothing special.  Why then did I give it four stars?  I guess cuz after seeing this movie I've deduced that the Sci-Fi movies are supposed to be this lousy, that maybe that is part of the channel's point?  To tell you the truth, even if you are a connoiseur of awful movies, this movie might fall too far off of even that scale for you and it really has nothing to redeem it.  I suggest if you want to see just how really bad this movie is then talk a friend into buying it so you can get to see it, but don't waste your own money on it. (My husband and I had a special reason for buying this movie, which is the only reason that made it worthwhile for us to watch it all the way through....just in case you were wondering why we bothered. No, we are not related to anyone involved in the making of this film...THANK GOODNESS!)",1346976000,2,1963,4.1421052631578945
5124354,5,B00834JQYG,Stare at the box art and think about THAT movie.  Too bad it's not the movie in the box.  There's nothing more that can be said.,1346284800,,128,3.8846153846153846
5124355,1,B00834JQYG,"I really must stop wasting my time watching anything produced by the SyFy station. Ever the optimist, I keep thinking ""well, maybe this one will be okay"", and each time my optimism is crushed and two hours of my life are wasted (not to mention god knows how many brain cells -- I always feel dumber after watching a SyFy movie!).

I watched this only because I am a HUGE bigfoot film geek, so the subject matter was close to my heart. But any resemblance to the beloved mythical cryptid is missing here -- this should have been called AN AMERICAN KING KONG! Really? Bigfoot is shown here as a GIANT beast who can snatch up people in one hand (and then bite their heads off). Um...? Where did such a HUGE thing ""hide"" for all these years? No one ever saw this thing? Well, except for the cast of a certain classic children's animated Christmas special, as this thing looks more like a ""Bumble"" than a bigfoot (shame it didn't bounce!).

There simply aren't enough words to describe just how bad this turd is. Wish I could give it 0 stars. I really must stop wasting my time on SyFy movies....",1342742400,5,1091,4.396039603960396
5124356,3,B00834JQYG,"Just when you thought the SyFy Channel couldn't lay a bigger egg than JERSEY SHORE SHARK ATTACK or PIRANHACONDA, we get BIGFOOT.
First off, the creature is more like King Kong and the effects are outlandishly hilarious, especially when he is running.  The climax on Mount Rushmore is side-splittingly funny.  The battle between the construction company and the animal rights group is cliche-heavy.  Notice that all the activists (except Williams) are females.  Also you will howl in agony as Bigfoot bites heads off like he's eating a snowcone or kicking them around like an NFL punter!
Obviously, this is meant to be a comedy.  Why else would Alice Cooper allow himself to be ""the extra point"" for the irritated monster?  And how can anyone take Danny Bonaduce and Barry Williams seriously?  Director Bruce Davison also plays the sheriff while TWIN PEAKS siren Sherilyn Fenn is now a doughy-faced detective.  Both wear goofy ear-flapped hats in an apparent homage to FARGO.  Add Howard Hesseman to the mix as the dopey mayor and you get your money's worth of has-been actors collecting paychecks.  Notice too how the weather changes constantly from fully snow-covered landscapes to lush green vistas.  It's truly a grade Z movie BUT you may find entertainment in its pure awfulness--it does have some laughs!
SyFy does equate to cheesey movies!",1341100800,10,1345,5.040723981900452

5124358,4,B00834JQYG,"I know art when I see it............and this isn't it.  It is, however, a lot of fun.  Yes, and stupid too.  Directed by, and co-starring Bruce Davison (Sheriff Walt Henderson).  The story features two egos out of control (Danny Bonaduce as a slimy self promoting slug named Harley Anderson and Barry Williams as a self-absorbed environmentalist, Simon Quint).  One wants to make money off the newly discovered BIGfoot, the other moron wants to protect it.  In the process a b-zillion people are killed, but no matter, it's all just a contest between these giant egos.  They will do anything to beat the other one to the prize, even if it kills them (but preferably, the other guy first).

Just about what you would expect from Asylum and the Syfy Channel.  I saw it first on TV so I knew exactly what I was getting.  Had to have it for the collection.",1428278400,,852,4.582781456953643
5124359,4,B00834JQYG,"The Asylum makes the silliest giant creature movies in history and always makes a profit on them. ""Bigfoot"" is one of the very cheesiest, but it's also one of the most entertaining if you want to see brainless lunacy starring your favorite B-list celebrities from yesteryear. In a nutshell, here everyone's favorite bad boy Danny Bonaduce plays Harley, a ruthless 1980s music festival promoter. He wants to have his big shindig in the woods, which is the home of...no points for guessing...Bigfoot. Barry Williams plays Simon, a loopy tree-hugger, who with his band of female environmental activists is in direct opposition to everything Harley stands for. Yes, it becomes a duel to the death (of sorts) in a weird Brady versus Partridge showdown that nobody ever had a right to expect in their lifetime. A personal favorite of mine, Howard Hesseman, makes a special dramatic appearance as the mayor of Deadwood, SD as the plot winds down to its hilarious denouement.

Without question, though, the best reason by far to watch this movie is to see Alice Cooper's appearance. I will not say anything more other than Cooper's big scene justifies the 90-minute running time by itself. You will need to rewind and see this part multiple times.

Of course this is a horror movie played for laughs: the effects are particularly lame; the actors appear to be having a great time, though in no case is it their finest thespian work; and the premise is predictable and creaky (well, maybe except for the finale on Mount Rushmore,) but if you take it for what it is you'll enjoy it.

The DVD comes with a ""Making of 'Bigfoot'"" feature and a gag reel, both of which are worth a look. If you like ludicrous monster pabulum featuring your favorite stars from a few decades back, ""Bigfoot"" is hard to beat.",1428019200,5,1792,4.774193548387097

5124363,3,B00834JQYG,Low budget movie but something to watch. Okay for the price we paid,1417651200,,67,4.230769230769231
5124364,1,B00834JQYG,"The film is what you expect. Direct to DVD to try and make a few cents back after it was shown on TV. I'm sure if they make back at least $5 they have made their money back on the total production cost. Believe me, I'm positive they paid the actors more than this thing cost to make.

Bigfoot is a horribly rendered CGI character that looks horrible, and I mean horrible. The acting of people being chased and eaten by this monster looks like way they did effects back in the 40's and 50's. I'm surprised they didn't just superimpose a guy in a monkey suit to give it more realism then the laughable effects in this.

So Red Hair Partridge boy and Greg Brady face off here. They used to have a band in the 80's, now one is a radio show host putting on a rock concert out at Mount Rushmore, and the other is a hippy trying to save the trees they had to demolish to make room for Borestock. You can tell from all the close up shots of a supposed crowed that there is actually about 10 people standing around pretending to be an audience. Of coarse, ya know, Bigfoot strikes, but the show goes on cause no one believes it, then Bigfoot strikes, who is the size of King Kong, and ya know, the army have to be brought in and yadda yadda yadda *blows raspberry* thumbs down.

It also stars the guy who played Lassard's brother in Police Academy 2 and Head of The Class... the chick from Rude Awakening, and that old guy who makes appearances on just about any TV show he can... last one I recall I saw was Knight Rider (2008). Yeah, nothing much to see here, you'd have to be pretty hard up and desperate for entertainment to somehow enjoy this thing. It also really says something when Alice Cooper is the best actor in this entire thing in his small 5 minute cameo.

Avoid. You won't ever regret it.",1415491200,,1795,4.224489795918367

5124366,3,B00834JQYG,"I couldn't decide whether to rate this as the awful bit of filmmaking (effects, acting, plotline) it is or a great satire on monsters-run-amuck films. It's definitely for those who can't sleep and that's the only reason I watched it. The ending is a King Kong rip-off and unless you get a kick out of seeing Alice Cooper picked up and tossed aside by Bigfoot, there's really not much else recommending it. if there's a tagline, it's: ""Never give a rock concert in Bigfoot's territory."" There are some nice views of Mount Rushmore, however...until the National Guard gets through with it, that is.",1390003200,,596,4.796116504854369

5124368,4,B00834JQYG,"I always enjoy badly made movies, it's obviously for the laughs. The low budget probably limits the quality of both the directors and the actors. This has both I believe.

5124370,2,B00834JQYG,"Well at least this not so good Syfy movie has some decent acting with some proved, if older actors. Danny Bonaduce, Barry Williams, Howard Hesseman, and Sherilyn Fenn at least can act, if a little over done. Not exactly what you expect in a movie from a Syfy. Boy do I know this. I keep watching the Syfy movies and am usually disappointed, hoping for the occasional good one, which does happen from time to time, usually because Syfy did not make it. The reason I say not so good is because the Bigfoot is so much larger than projections and eyewitness (?) reports. It is way too strong, throwing several ton construction machines like I would toss around my little rescue dogs. They are 25 pounders and while I would never throw them around it is the same thought. I like Alice Coopers appearance but the total movie is not that good.",1376784000,,836,4.470588235294118

5124372,5,B00834JQYG,"Bigfoot is a Syfy original movie that is a lot of fun. It's probably up there with Mega Python vs. Gatoroid as being the most entertaining Syfy original movie. Sure, I would have preferred a man in a suit to have played Bigfoot instead of Bigfoot being CGI. But with all the action and laughs that this movie packed into just an hour and a half, that can be forgiven. And there were actually some good actors in this as well.",1368835200,,425,4.2592592592592595
5124373,4,B00834JQYG,"If you're an old geeeezer like ME, and you actually REMEMBER those two TV series [titler mention] that didn't quite match-up...

Well, anyway. This is NOT a good Sci Fi movie, but BEING a syfy sci fi movie, it is GREAT, thus taking a point off for BEING a
bad movie, and adding a point for being a bad movie gives it TWO fingers UP on both hands, rounding out to FOUR stars.

Most amazing part to ME was we have never actually FOUND a Big Foot... because we've been looking for a seven-footer: he's 50',
and destructive because he cannot find a mate that -- excuse me -- MEASURES UP!

5124374,3,B00834JQYG,Pretty weird movie. Was nice Danny and Barry again after so many years. Bigfoot was pretty creepy. Have seen better Bigfoot movies.,1360540800,,131,5.0
5124375,2,B00834JQYG,"I may be The Asylum's biggest fan, but even I cannot defend this film.  Apparently believing that untold TV fans have spent years desperately longing for Danny Bonaduce and Barry Williams to have a go at one another (and yet somehow missed their Celebrity Boxing match a few years back), The Asylum threw together a quick script, hired some of the worst special effects guys in the business, and called it Bigfoot.  The big guy doesn't have much going for him here (besides a nasty case of sudden-onset eczema on his head and a tendency to grow and shrink by tens of feet from one scene to another), but I will say this for Bigfoot.  He's pissed off.  This ain't your typical Bigfoot, hiding out in the wilderness and roaring or throwing rocks at any human who manages to get close to him.  This Bigfoot is constantly out in the open, stomping people, ripping people in two, snapping the heads off of unfortunate human victims, taking out really stupid people in helicopters, you name it.  If he weren't brought to digital life so amateurishly, he would be a total bad ass.

The setting is Deadwood, South Dakota.  Local DJ Harley Anderson (Danny ""Partridge"" Bonaduce) will stop at nothing to make sure his 1980s Outdoor Music Festival will go on as planned.  (Don't get too excited - the only 80s rocker you'll get to see here is Alice Cooper, and he doesn't even get to sing.)  His biggest obstacles are a freak snowstorm and the constant protests of some tree-hugging neo-hippies led by Simon Quint (Barry ""Greg Brady"" Williams) - or so he thought until Bigfoot shows up.  Apparently, Bigfoot really, really, really hate 80s music, thus proving himself to be more beast than man.  Anyway, the rest of the movie consists of Anderson trying to kill the creature while Quint and his young minions attempt to save its life by capturing it alive.  Of course, untold people die horrible deaths before everything comes to a head - Abraham Lincoln's head, to be exact, the one on Mount Rushmore.

Sadly, Bonaduce is actually the best actor involved in this project, which tells you all you need to know about the acting on display.  Howard Hesseman turns up as Deadwood's mayor, thus proving that his career is pretty much over, and - in the ""oh how they've fallen"" category - a plump Sherilyn Fenn surfaces as the local sheriff.  As for that big 80s music festival, the Woodstock comparisons don't exactly come to fruition, as no more than 50 people showed up.  And those special effects - give me a green screen and a cheap camera, and I could probably do better.

Lest I forget, though, the film is somewhat educational.  In addition to informing all of those real-life hunters out there that the best way to flush a Bigfoot out of his lair is to play 80s music, this film also alerts us to the fact that we should turn all of our lights off at night so as not to annoy any nearby Bigfoot.  You'll also get a special appreciation for our military's Special Forces.  Who knew it was so difficult to get a rifle fix - with a scope, no less - on a giant Bigfoot head twenty feet away?  And, whatever you do, don't sneak up on a soldier with a gun, as he's liable to pump you full of bullets, even long after he's discovered you're actually a person and not a mythical, hairy beast.",1352678400,6,3276,4.535714285714286
5124376,4,B00834JQYG,"I expected to turn this off after the first five minutes but instead I was actually drawn in.
You can tell that Danny Bonaduce and Barry Williams are having a great time with this and the viewer instantly picks up on that.
It's goofy, silly, and just plain dumb but it also has something else I didn't expect.  It has a great sense of humor.  It NEVER takes itself seriously and the scene with Alice Cooper is just hilarious.
This film was made for dudes to get together, sit and watch in their hockey shirts with a massive bong sitting on the coffee table.  I can't resist a Bigfoot movie and this one is unlike any other. First off, Bigfoot is a giant monster in this. He looks pretty cool even though the CGI isn't all that great but it contains some wildly funny monster attacks.
Lets face it...Bigfoot movies are SUPPOSED to suck but this one does in it's own unique charm.
