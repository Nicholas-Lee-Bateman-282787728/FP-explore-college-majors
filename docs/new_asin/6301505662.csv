338212,5,6301505662,"Considering how long ago this was made, I expected less sound quality from a VHS tape.
It's great.",1311638400,,98,4.5
338213,5,6301505662,"I remember seeing this on late night Cinemax. I fell in love with it. I thought it was fantastic. A young boy grows up on the streets, living by his wits. He emerges untamed, and the ultimate urban survivalist and fights the major bad guys with what he finds in the alleys and the dumpsters.
One of the great underrated movies.
I, too, wish they would put this one out on DVD.
Hey, they did it to Monster Squad--another fantastic movie--let's go two for two!
Best Line:
Head Bad Guy: Go out there and see if he's there.
Punk: What do I do if he is?
Head Bad Guy: Then shoot him with your gun, a&#hole.
ROFL!!!
I never forgot that one. Robert Davi just delivered that one perfectly as the main bad guy",1207440000,5,700,4.231343283582089
338214,4,6301505662,"I too remember this one and in gact came to this US site to see if it was on here as I'm based on the UK.

Fantastic film, definately worthy of a DVD conversion.",1110758400,,161,3.735294117647059
338215,4,6301505662,"i remember loving this flick as a kid, and i haven't seen it in years. i doubt there is enough of a fan base to warrant a transfer to dvd, but 75 cents for a used vhs is the next best thing, i suppose. any fan of fantasy or comic book/urban hero stories should check this out... it's kinda like batman, if batman was homeless and afraid of bluecoats and whitecoats. i think robert davi is the villain, but i may be wrong. definitely worth a look for nostalgia purposes.",1096416000,2,469,4.222222222222222

7813017,2,6301505662,terrible.  I kept waiting for the cast of west side story to burst out and sing off key.  at the end (my lack of judgement) I was just glad it was over.,1505952000,,152,3.71875

A great B-Movie classic with a pretty decent cast.
All men want to be him; just to be with Kathleen Quinlan",1463788800,,140,4.035714285714286
7813022,3,6301505662,"Great movie, for the 80's. I loved this movie when I was young. It is still a great movie. However, with all the advances, I have to give it 3 stars rating it against today's movies.",1456012800,,182,4.083333333333333

7813024,2,6301505662,Attempt to create a Tarzan film in the urban jungle of New York has a pretty solid screenplay by John Sayles (writer of Piranha and The Howling)--one of his last B-movie scripts before he devoted his energies full-time to writing and directing earnest films like Lone Star and Eight Men Out and becoming a critical darling.  Unfortunately poor direction and horrible casting (the child version of Wild Thing can't act and the adult version is the ugliest Tarzan of all time) completely trash the film--this one is crying out to be remade by people with more talent and imagination.  I'm a big fan of John Sayles' B-movie work before he decided he was really an artist with important things to say but I definitely can't recommend this one.,1438560000,,739,4.765625
