389452,4,6301965663,"Back in 1933, this was a huge hit: moviegoers rushed to see two of Hollywood's most popular stars co-cast in a musical comedy-drama! Crawford plays beautiful Janie Barlow, an ambitious dancer who wants to rise to the top with class and dignity. As Patch Gallagher, the show director, Gable plays it rough and sexy: the two generate a lot of electrical currents together and their off-Screen attraction for each other is quite obviously evident. The original story for this film - which introduced the Three Stooges to film - was a serial published in THE SATURDAY EVENING POST. Gable was supposedly ill during production due to a leg condition known then as ""toxic leg"": he had an appendectomy.....As ""punishment"" for holding up the production, Louis B. Mayor later loaned him out to Columbia for IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. But Gable got the last laugh: he won the Oscar! Some sources state the reason for the above scenerio was Gable's refusal to do another ""tough guy"" role. Who knows? THE RHYTHM OF THE DAY sequence is brilliantly imaginitive. This film served as the film debut of a 35 year-old hoofer. His name was Fred Astaire.",1041465600,3,1129,4.824742268041237
389453,4,6301965663,"In this glossy 1933 hit, Joan Crawford is an aspiring dancer who wants a chance to make it big. She meets a rich playboy (Franchot Tone), who, behind the scenes, paves the way for her to get her big break. He arranges for her to get a part in the new Broadway musical directed by Clark Gable, who grudgingly gives her a part, after he realizes that she does, in fact, have talent.
This is an MGM extravaganza in which the studio pulled out all the stops. There is something for everyone. Look for Busby Berkley-esque musical numbers, cameo performances by the three stooges, Fred Astaire's screen debut as Joan's dancing partner, and a Nelson Eddy performance that pre-dates his Jeanette MacDonald days. This is definitely an oldie but a goodie.
Delightful performances are given by the entire cast. Joan Crawford can, in fact, dance and is terrific in her role. Gable is definitely on his way to becoming a screen heart throb. This is also one of Franchot Tone's most ingratiating performances, as he looks like he is really besotted with Ms. Crawford. It comes as no surprise that he later became her second husband, as his performance is positively inspired. The film is vintage Hollywood.

389540,1,6301965663,"Joan Crawford a dancer????  Again????  Clark Gable some sort of producer????  What?????  Joan Crawford, late in life, would profess that she had a wonderful sense of dance.  When?  She certainly doesn't do any terpsichorean feats here.  She's clumsy.  Like a cow you want to punch.  Or tip over.  This film may have been a hit upon release, but it is neither Crawford's nor Gable's finest hour by any stretch of the imagination.  A producer, I would think, would at least know his way around a musical number and Gable doesn't know his way around a showgirl in this film.  Yikes.

It's putrid.

It get's better.  Here come the Three Stooges.  Yup, you heard me.  Here they are.  Oh, and here comes Nelson Eddy, singing ""Everything I Have Is Yours"", a gross song, which Crawford sings with him going ""da-da-da-da-da-da-da-"".  Reprehensible.

But there's more.  In an odd number, pretty much the finale, it's Joan and Fred Astaire (FRED ASTAIRE!!!!!) in his film debut pounding the dust out of the carpet as some impossible stage brings them everywhere but earth, even whirling around the sky.  Odd.  It's the oddest musical moment in Crawford's career until the dastardaly ""Two Faced Woman"" number 20 years later.  The bitch can't dance.  Astaire can, and he high-tailed it over to RKO after this mess to team up with Ginger Rogers.

And history is made.  Was made.  Will be made.

Also in the cast is Franchot Tone, he of the big schwang (supposedly) and the love of Crawford's then life.  Before the kids and all.  Anyway, it's an MGM feature from 1933 and for Gable and Crawford it was a huge hit.

389541,4,6301965663,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) presents ""DANCING LADY"" (1933) (92 min/B&W) -- Starring: Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Franchot Tone, May Robson, Fred Astaire, Robert Benchley, Ted Healy, Nelson Eddy, Sterling Holloway, Moe Howard, Curly Howard, Larry Fine

Directed by Robert Z. Leonard

Janie Barlow (Joan Crawford) lives to dance and will dance anywhere, even stripping in a burlesque house. Tod Newton (Franchot Tone), the rich playboy, discovers her there and helps her get a job in a real Broadway musical being directed by Patch Gallagher. Tod thinks he can get what he wants from Janie, Patch thinks Janie is using her charms rather than talent to get to the top, and Janie thinks Patch is the greatest. Steve (Ted Healy), the stage manager, has the Three Stooges (Moe, Curly & Larry) helping him manage all the show girls.

A dancer named Fred Astaire makes his official film debut, and Nelson Eddy pops in for a song.

Astaire dances with Joan Crawford and is as light as a feather and as smooth as silk, compared to Crawford's clunky style of dancing.

Gable is muscular, sexy, and rough around the edges.

It is the first film where the three stooges were actually billed as ""stooges,"" and they come complete with their finger-poking and face-slapping antics.

* Special Footnote: -- Fred Astaire's movie debut. Though he was reported to have appeared years earlier in the silent film Fanchon, the Cricket, he and his sister Adele only visited the set; they did not appear on camera in that one.

** Another Special Footnote: -- Ted Healy is actually credited as 'Ted Healy and His Stooges,' but because the Stooges are also credited individually later (as Stagehands), he is listed just as 'Ted Healy'.

389543,4,6301965663,"Frequent co-stars Joan Crawford and Clark Gable are very memorable indeed in DANCING LADY, perhaps the most popular of their films. Their unique chemistry carries over perfectly from the screen. Also appearing in this movie is Franchot Tone, who would go on to marry Crawford two years later.

DANCING LADY was filmed by MGM in 1933 as their answer to rival studio Warner Brothers' hugely-successful ""42nd Street"", choreographed by Busby Berklely. The formula is copied in DANCING LADY with a fair degree of success. Joan Crawford plays Janie Barlow, a street-smart burlesque dancer who finally hits the bright lights of Broadway...but will she marry the society gent who picked her up from the gutter, or her hard-boiled Broadway director?

As mentioned above, the musical numbers are very reminiscent of those choreographed by Busby Berkeley for ""42nd Street""--even the final number, ""Rhythm of the Day"", is staged as a direct parody of the title song in ""42nd Street"". This was Crawford's return to the glittery musicals that had made her name, following a series of successful (""Grand Hotel"", ""Letty Lynton"") and not-so-successful (""Rain"", ""Today We Live"") comedies and dramas.

Clark Gable and Franchot Tone are well-cast in the two leading male roles. The movie also features early screen appearances from The Three Stooges and Fred Astaire, plus a singing cameo from Nelson Eddy. For fans of the classic musicals, it's hard to resist DANCING LADY.

The DVD also features two Vitaphone musical shorts (""Plane Nuts"" and ""Roast-Beef & the Movies""), plus the trailer. Also available as part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clark-Gable-The-Signature-Collection-Dancing-Lady-China-Seas-San-Francisco-Wife-vs-Secretary-Boom-Town-Mogambo/dp/B000F7CMRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clark Gable - The Signature Collection (Dancing Lady / China Seas / San Francisco / Wife vs. Secretary / Boom Town / Mogambo)</a>.",1297296000,,1954,5.918439716312057
389544,4,6301965663,"Extras with this MGM/Warner DVD include two historically interesting musical shorts: PLANE NUTS (1933) with Ted Healy & his Stooges, and ROAST BEEF AND MOVIES (1934) with Jerome 'Curly' Howard.

DANCING LADY is an early MGM musical about a burlesque hoofer trying to get her break on the Great White Way (Crawford), and the two men who love her: a rich, manipulative socialite (Tone) and the show's cash-strapped producer (Gable). No guesswork here: in the end, the right guy gets the girl!

Fred Astaire's top hat and tails unbilled screen debut opposite Miss Crawford is a showstopper called ""Heigh Ho/Let's Go Bavarian."" Robert Benchley contributed some dialogue (mostly his own) but also received no official credit.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.

(6.7) Dancing Lady (1933) - Joan Crawford/Clark Gable/Franchot Tone/May Robson/Winnie Lightner/Fred Astaire/Robert Benchley/Ted Healy & his Stooges/Nelson Eddy/Sterling Holloway (uncredited: Eve Arden)",1297209600,2,999,5.596026490066225
389565,5,6301965663,"This is an excellent vehicle for Clark Gable and Joan Crawford. He has a gruff, devil may care part, which suits him perfectly. Ms. Crawford gets a chance to show off her dancing prowess, which was a reason she broke into show business. When young, she was a dish, and Gable, can I say, hunk. This film is a keeper and should be in every classic film buff's library.",1272153600,,366,4.318840579710145
389566,4,6301965663,"In 1932, Joan Crawford cut her teeth as Sadie Thompson in ""Rain"" and, worse still, was miscast as a British aristocrat in the dreadful Howard Hawks buddy movie ""Today We Live"".  She wanted (needed) a hit.  ""Dancing Lady"", MGM's response to the trendsetting ""42nd Street"", was the result.

This film placed Crawford squarely within her comfort zone as an ambitious hoofer determined to make the big time, an almost autobiographical screenplay. Surrounded by MGM gloss and 2 leading men, the superstar Clark Gable and the rising aristocrat, Franchot Tone, Crawford was easily able to suggest the drive of an ambitious performer even if her singing and dancing skills were merely adequate. The result is an odd musical which combines some earthiness with the customary artificial MGM glamour. Crawford is at her most appealing, both physically and emotionally, with Gable and she puts on the Ritz with Tone. The musical numbers are a mess without the focus of the best of Busby Berkeley and the songs, with the exception of the standard ""Everything I have is Yours"", are unmemorable. Nelson Eddy and Fred Astaire famously made their debuts here, neither showing any particular star quality, particularly Astaire. The awful Ted Healey is on hand with the 3 Stooges mainly hovering in the background.  Also, you can see Eve Arden in a short cameo as a southern dame and Lyn Bari is a teenage chorus girl in one number.  The good news is that, contrary to so many MGM DVDs, the print is immaculate, preserving the crisp black and white lighting and the shiny art deco sets.

Some unusual extras are included. One short has some vaudeville comedy from Healey and the Stooges and Curly appears in the other. Both are dreadful except for historical reasons because they contain some discarded musical numbers from a shelved MGM musical called ""The March of Time"", filmed in the crude 2 strip Technicolor of the time. Ann Dvorak is clearly visible hoofing away in one number.

The package is expensive but can be purchased more cheaply as part of the Clark Gable Signature Collection within which it is an odd fit for this is a Crawford opus and not one of Gable's finer moments.",1270252800,,2169,4.861788617886178
389567,4,6301965663,"On the minus side, the plot is obvious, sometimes forced, the comedy often trite, and the big production numbers are strange.  OK, production numbers are always strange, I suppose.  ""Heigh-Ho, the Gang's All Here""/""Let's Go Bavarian"" is a paean to beer, no doubt inspired by the end of Prohibition, first in formal dress, then after a magic carpet ride to Bavaria, lederhosen and dirndls ensue.  The other number puts a happy face on the times, showing people from other periods of history and various dispositions being transformed into the chic and modern ""Rhythm of the Day.""

On the plus side, most of the actors are interesting and attractive, some parts are funny (my favorite sight gag has Crawford and Gable seeming to duke it out with opposing weight machines), there is some life in the plot, and the production numbers do have quite a bit of dazzle and appeal just the same.

It's interesting to watch Crawford before her face became harder--though she already has that edge at times--and to see her dance and hear her sing.  She can move her feet well, not with the grace of the best dancers, but with good tapping.  And her singing was OK too.  We get to see a lot of her in this pre-Code movie.  Great legs.  She brought more nuance to the acting than was probably asked of her, which does help.

Gable's young and energetic, thinner, and holds his own with Crawford.  Franchot Tone comes in a distinct second to Gable, as he was supposed to.

The screen debuts of Fred Astaire and Nelson Eddy are limited almost entirely to singing and dancing numbers, which they do well, of course.  Standing out like sore thumbs with their physical comedy, still fun for many, are Ted Healy and His [Three] Stooges, who show up several times.  Healy has a major supporting role, mostly straight when he's not dealing with the Stooges.  And the ever-distinctive Eve Arden has an uncredited early bit part.  There's what may have been intended to be a (brief) caricature of a gay Broadway writer, over-the-top emotionally and effeminate, played for laughs.

The film appears to be clipped a little on the sides to fit the full-screen format.  (The opening credits have small blacks bars at the top and bottom that widen the aspect ratio, and later, when the bars are gone, the action occasionally goes off the edge a little.  IMDb confirms that the original aspect ratio was 1.37:1, not the 1.33:1 we get on the DVD.)  The print is clean, the mono sound OK.

For those who didn't get enough production numbers and stooges in the main feature, there are two short films as extras.  Plane Nuts, also from 1933, is almost 20 minutes of Healy, the Stooges and dancers (dancing with a theme of airplanes).  Roast Beef & Movies, from 1934, is over 16 minutes of stoogelike behavior from George Givot, Jerry (Curly) Howard and Bobby Callahan, with dancing women, and music by Dmitri Tiomkin.  There's minimal evidence (outside the credits that say so) that it was originally in color; the colors are very faded.  Great for people who like that kind of thing.  I found both shorts too long by about their entire lengths, but I'm not a Stooge fan.

The main feature is worth seeing, but approach it with only moderate expectations.",1262736000,4,3221,4.713774597495528
389568,4,6301965663,"Dancing Lady (Robert Z. Leonard, 1933)

Leonard, who made over one hundred fifty films during his lifetime and was twice nominated for the Best Director Oscar (for 1930's The Divorcee and 1936's The Great Ziegfeld), here directs a handful of stars on the rise in a film that time seems to have forgotten. I don't really understand why, given the cast. The leads are Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, and Franchot Tone, and the cameos include the Three Stooges, Nelson Eddy, and (in his first screen appearance) Fred Astaire. The cast alone seems to be enough to raise this one to immortal level, and yet it hasn't happened. I have no idea why.

Crawford plays Janie Barlow, a dancer who's fallen on hard enough times in New York that she's performing in burlesque shows. After a police raid, she's hauled in front of the bench and gives a passionate speech about her love for dancing. The speech affects a court hanger-on, wealthy playboy Tod Newton (Tone), who springs her from jail and uses his connections to get her some more legitimate jobs. It's at this point she meets well-known producer Patch Gallagher (Gable), who's also attracted to her. Cue love-triangle melodrama, but instead of going the way of the weepie, Leonard and screenwriters Rivkin and Wolfson (if I started mentioning credits we'd be here all day) keep this flick planted firmly in the screwball-comedy-musical genre.

I have to say that the whole thing is actually kind of tame for a pre-code flick released not long before the Hays Commission clamped down on the industry in 1934, but it's still quite amusing, the acting is as good as you'd expect it to be, and the script is dazzling. Whether you are already a fan of pre-code film or whether you're just starting to unearth some of the many gems to be found there, Dancing Lady is well worth your time. ****",1259539200,,1831,4.733542319749216
389569,4,6301965663,"A surprisingly good movie. Disreputable dancer becomes star. Joan Crawford seen as a dancer, not as a dark character as portrayed in her later films. Also the First film of Fred Astaire. Other future stars can be spotted, for instance Eve Arden (Palmolive lady, Grease,etc...) Ted Healy and the Stooges really have a limited role, nevertheless an enjoyable film to watch.",1218758400,2,371,5.098360655737705
389570,5,6301965663,"""Them things won't mix with Those things"". This was Jamie Barlow's(Joan Crawford) final excuse for again turning down dandy Todd Newton's(Franchot Tone) latest marriage proposal, leaving the door wide open to complete her long simmering chase of hard-to-get musical show director Patch Gallagar(Clark Gable). Her point was that, as a former downtown burlesque dancer, she wouldn't feel comfortable nor fulfilled as the ornament of a filthy rich high society scion. She wanted to continue her dancing career for an indefinite period. Although this film was included in my Clark Gable Signature Collection, as the title and credit order suggest, Joan Crawford was considered the primary star. In large part, it turned out to be semi-autobiographical. Crawford was primarily a dancer in her silent era show business career. Franchot Tone, frustrated in  his pursuit of Crawford in this film, managed to get a marriage license out of her a few years later.  But, the marriage failed within a few years, in part, because of their different backgrounds and preferred lifestyles. Tone was, in fact, a Yankee blue blood, as portrayed in this film. Although never including Gable among her 5 husbands, the two apparently were occasional lovers until his death.
  The unbelievable sequence where Crawford pursues Gable whereever he goes for some days, and he refuses to even give her a verbal brush off, may simply serve to burlesque the strength of her ambition to join his troop and his fear of harassment by girls wanting a position in his troop.
However, I get the impression Gable instinctively knows at first sight that she is potential romantic dynamite for him and doesn't want to get involved at this time. The give and take between Crawford and Gable, and between Crawford and Tone, dominates the middle of the film. It's clear that Crawford's huge expressive eyes are hard to resist.  But she's very stingy in dishing out her hard core romantic responses, even to always smiling debonair Tone, who bailed her out of jail and  got her started with Gable's dance team.
  The show, in its final form, in an extravaganza, featuring Crawford and newcomer Fred Astaire as dancing-singing partners in several numbers. In Busby Berekeley-style, it begins as a believable stage production and progresses into several surreal sequences which could only be produced via cinematic techniques, with occasional returns to stage musical sequences. Among the surreal sequences, we see Crawford and Astaire float up and down on a saucer-like magic carpet, while dancing.
In another sequence, various people in archaic dress and modes of transport are magically transformed into modern dress and fashionable transport as they emerge from behind an archway. The most visually complex surreal sequence features a carousel in which the horses and chorus girl riders are both floor and ceiling mirrored, as well as shadowed in the background.  In addition, a cone-shaped rotating kaleidoscopic structure emerges skyward from the center of the carousel, studded with chorus girls who appear and disappear with rotation.
  Nelson Eddy, in only his second cameo appearance in a film, dominates the vocals in part of the final show scene. Already, it's clear he will probably become a major film singer. Vaudevillian Ted Healy has considerable screen time as Gable's assistant. His 3 Stooges, still in their first year of films, appear briefly from time to time as wacky prop men.  You'll never again see them in an Astaire or Gable film! Too bad they couldn't cut out their slapping and poking each other and been cast as a comedic element of otherwise musical or drama-dominated films.
  This DVD also includes 2 shorts: ""Plane Nuts"" and ""Roast Beef and Movies"", that include one or all of the Stooges plus some Busby-Berkeley-like chorus girl routines.",1209859200,,3830,5.156451612903226
389571,5,6301965663,"Dancing Lady is a wonderful early MGM musical. The convincing acting impressed me and the plot moves along at a good pace.

The action begins with Janie Barlow (Joan Crawford) and her pal Rosette (Winnie Lightner) dancing in a burlesque show. One drunken man nearly tears off Janie's blouse leaving her almost topless; and that's precisely the moment when the cops raid the place. They're all hauled off to jail. However, Janie gets out pretty quickly--it seems that a very wealthy would-be suitor, Tod Newton (Franchot Tone), bails Janie out to get to know her better. Eventually Tod helps get Janie a small part in an upcoming Broadway production. It is during rehearsals that Janie becomes much more familiar with the director Patch Gallagher (Clark Gable).

Of course, Tod has his eyes on Janie; and he tries to woo her every way that he can. He arranges with the head boss to have Janie paid for rehearsing, although in reality Tod is paying her through the head boss. Tod takes Janie to his home for a fancy swim and he eventually goes to extremes to win Janie's love.

Meanwhile, during rehearsals for the show Patch starts to have feelings for Janie even though he tries to fight them off. Janie does seem more comfortable with Patch than she is with Tod, too.

What happens next? The plot could go anywhere from here. Will Janie marry Tod as he wants her to? What will happen, if anything, between Patch and Janie? What happens when the production is suddenly closed down? How will the show go on--if it goes on at all? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the film to find out.

The choreography is wonderful in every dance scene; and the theater scenes within the movie are very well done. The cinematography works well, too.

Overall Dancing Lady is a fine early MGM musical that some say is MGM's answer to 42nd Street. This is a wonderful movie for fans of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable. Look also for a great performance by Franchot Tone as Tod Newton; and there's also some comic relief by The Three Stooges. In addition, there are numerous stunning visual effects and a show stopping number or two toward the end of the film even if the Bavarian number is a bit unusual.

Enjoy!",1199923200,5,2209,4.619897959183674
389572,5,6301965663,"Janie Barlow (Joan Crawford) is a dancer; she'll do anything to dance, including dance in a strip show. She's quite a beautiful girl, and despite her low standards, she draws the attention of a wealthy playboy Tod Newton (Franchot Tone).

She's torn between Tod and her career, which seems to be flourishing in front of her very eyes.

I've always loved Joan Crawford, especially the gorgeous Joan of the early '30s, so this movie is an absolute delight for me. It helps that two wonderful actors join her: hubby Franchot Tone and lover Clark Gable. They're flanked by some major stars making early film appearances: the Three Stooges, Fred Astaire, and Nelson Eddy. Not bad for an early musical. This one is pretty innovative too with all of the moving camera shots and Busby Berkeley-like dancing sequences. This film is completely saccharine and not the kind of film you learn something from, but it is completely entertaining and a joy to watch.

Also included on this DVD are two musical shorts featuring one or more of the Three Stooges. Plane Nuts stars Ted Healy and his Stooges in a cute short with the group in their very early stage. Each stooge is very funny in his own right, but it is interesting to see how differently they behaved when they first began. This short features popular music of the era. Roast Beef and Movies is a technicolor short featuring Curly Howard.",1196380800,4,1556,4.634057971014493
389573,4,6301965663,"Frequent co-stars Joan Crawford and Clark Gable are very memorable indeed in DANCING LADY, perhaps the most popular of their films.  Their unique chemistry carries over perfectly from the screen.  Also appearing in this movie is Franchot Tone, who would go on to marry Crawford two years later.

DANCING LADY was filmed by M-G-M in 1933 as their answer to rival studio Warner Brothers' hugely-successful ""42nd Street"", choreographed by Busby Berklely.  The formula is copied in DANCING LADY with a fair degree of success.  Joan Crawford plays Janie Barlow, a street-smart burlesque dancer who finally hits the bright lights of Broadway...but will she marry the society gent who picked her up from the gutter, or her hard-boiled Broadway director?

As mentioned above, the musical numbers are very reminiscent of those choreographed by Busby Berkeley for ""42nd Street""--even the final number, ""Rhythm of the Day"", is staged as a direct parody of the title song in ""42nd Street"".  This was Crawford's return to the glittery musicals that had made her name, following a series of successful (""Grand Hotel"", ""Letty Lynton"") and not-so-successful (""Rain"", ""Today We Live"") comedies and dramas.

Clark Gable and Franchot Tone are well-cast in the two leading male roles.  The movie also features early screen appearances from The Three Stooges and Fred Astaire, plus a singing cameo from Nelson Eddy.  For fans of the classic musicals, it's hard to resist DANCING LADY.

The DVD also features two Vitaphone musical shorts (""Plane Nuts"" and ""Roast-Beef & the Movies""), plus the trailer.

389574,5,6301965663,"Along with A WOMAN'S FACE this is one of my favorite Joan Crawford films.  This is early Joan Crawford, but she was allready clearly a STAR.  She has romantic scenes with Franchot Tone, trades punches and pawing with Clark Gable, trades quips with Ted Healy and the 3 stooges, and goes toe to toe with Fred Astaire in his first movie... he has only ONE line and the big production number, and struggles to sing in HER key.

Study some dance history before you fault her dancing.  Joan was a nightlife and film CHARLESTON dancer.  With knees akimbo - the style of the day - she flaps her way with abandon (which is what she was known for in clubs), and she holds her own with intricate tap steps that are on par with today's best.  The style is dated, but so is Nelson Eddy's singing in the ""Rhythm of the Day"" number.

This film has 7 males stars and... JOAN - not just holding her own, but LEADING them.  This plot is flimsy, but a lot sterner stuff than most musicals of that day; and very risque, too!  Enjoy this teaser-to-tapper treat.  Thank you Karl and Patty for the gift of an all time favorite.",1192665600,7,1104,4.315533980582524
389605,5,6301965663,"""Dancing Lady"" is MGM's way of sticking it to Warners' ""42nd Street."" I much prefer ""Dancing Lady."" There are so many Stars in it! Of course, Joan Crawford is the biggest movie star in it. Did anyone else know that she could dance like that? Taking second-billing is Clark Gable and getting third billing is Joan's second husband (they weren't married when the movie was made), Franchot Tone. Also included in this classic film is a rare dancing number with Fred Astaire; this was his first movie! And, even The Three Stooges have a part in this unforgettable masterpiece! Not since ""Grand Hotel"" was Joan surrounded with such unprecedented talent!",1191888000,7,648,4.9
389606,5,6301965663,"There is a lot going on here visually, musically and artistically- and much of it is specific to the style of the time -1933.

Most surreal is seeing the Three Stooges next to Joan Crawford and Fred Astaire. This was at MGM, before the boys went over to Columbia. There are a couple of other Stooge shorts on the disk- also made by MGM with Busby Berkely-type chorus girl shots! The production values were far more lavish than their Columbia shorts. Makes me wonder what they would have accomplished had they stayed at the bigger and richer studio.

Joan Crawford was hot! She looked good next to Gable, and it makes me wish they would release ""Possessed"" (1931). I would also like to see some of her other early films, including some of the silents, where she plays dancer/hottie.",1170028800,5,781,4.611510791366906
389607,5,6301965663,"And no movie like this one! If you have never seen a Joan Crawford movie before, this is the one to see. Every one will love it,and there is something in it for everyone I promise...the suprisingly talented and moreover stunningly beautiful 1933 incarnation of Joan Crawford is one you won't believe. Joan is Janie Barlow;a street smart,no-nonsense, ambitious and beautiful aspiring dancer. She is determined to make herself succeed in this business, no matter what the pratfalls, waiting to catch a break and relying on her sheer will and hard work to dance her way to the top .....and ""yes, it's GOT to be dancin!"".Sound familair?

One night, the burelesque house where janie is dancing at is raided,and her indignation worsens when she gets put in the slammer, however she is delighted when rich playboy Todd Newton(husband number two,Franchot Tone)bails her out. But much like our Joanie, our Janie is no fool, and wholeheartedly insists she will pay him back with the cash and nothing else. Undeterred, she hikes it to Broadway ""uptown where it's art"" to get a hold of ""Patch"" Gallagher(Clark Gable)the shows cranky but equally no-nonsense producer. Janie knows early on she wants the part and the producer, but not if Todd has anything to say about it....perfection pretty much ensues in some of the memorable scenes I have ever seen ,beautiful cinematography and the direction is very clever especially during janie's relentless pursuit of ""patch"" early on in the movie. Although it was common for joan to portray a character like this in part to appeal to depression era audiences, it was the combination of her fierce independence and wise-cracking gusto that made this one work. Her sexual chemistry with Gable is so powerful, they not only made 7 more movies together,but you can feel it  this radiate out of the tv 74 years later. This movie does have something for everyone... Fred Astaire in his movie debut makes a luminious vision dancing with joan/janie and LOOK CLOSELY and you will spot the munchkinland and Emerald City sets( during the Bavaria and Rythym of the Day sequences)which would be used 6 years later in The Wizard of Oz. Also of interest: this film is pre-code meaning there is sex, sex SEX..in a tasteful and funny manner ,of course. I  I cannot say enough about this film... go watch it.",1168905600,5,2320,4.883248730964467
389608,5,6301965663,"I was so impressed with this great production on DVD.  Young, beautiful Joan Crawford is so talented ~ I had no idea.  She is vivacious, sexy, dances, sings, dives and swims ~ she absolutely sparkles.  Clark Gable is young, handsome, and shows off his athletic body in the gym.  Fred Astaire is in his debut in this film where Joan and him dance together.  There is also the Three Stooges, as well.  It has great fun dialogue, is very technically modern for its time, extremely entertaining, fast paced, and an absolute joy to watch this CLASSIC film ~ WHAT A TREAT!!  THEY SURE DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE. YOU WILL LOVE IT AS I DO AND PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!",1154995200,21,670,4.442622950819672
389609,4,6301965663,"Clark Gable may have been the right star at the wrong studio - just think what Warner Bros. could have done with him in the Thirties - but he still had enough star quality to overcome even the most dubious casting. Take Dancing Lady, MGM's take on Warners' backstage Busby Berkeley musicals. It's a terrific movie put together with no expense spared, but somehow Gable isn't the first name that springs to mind when you think of a musical director putting on a Broadway revue. But then Joan Crawford isn't the first name you'd think of for a downtown gal going from Burlesque to Broadway and exhibiting the singing ability of Lee Marvin and the dancing skills of a fugitive from a chain gang (there's a difference between dancing and just knowing the steps).

All clichs are present and correct, from Joan replacing an `untalented' star who can dance her off the screen to the chorus girls with great faces but horrendous voices. Somehow it doesn't matter: it's too much fun and too ridiculous for that, especially in the absurdly overproduced musical finale which would need a theatre the size of Times Square to stage (great lyrics too: ""Here in Bavaria/We'll take good care of ya""). Franchot Tone provides the romantic rivalry, Fred Astaire the only discernible dancing ability. Far more enjoyable than it has any right to be.

There are a few minor print glitches in the first half hour, but otherwise this is a pretty good restoration.",1154822400,5,1440,4.779116465863454
389610,5,6301965663,"This was an unknown treasure, made the year my parents were born.

Joan Crawford was so fresh and appealing before her campy older movies.  Clark Gable was always hot--I think he made ""It happened one night"" the same year.  But for me Franchot Tone stole the show.

Star and sex appeal that just doesn't quit.  I was rooting for him to get the girl, even knowing it wasn't going to happen.  More handesome and sophisticated than Gable.  Who'd have thought?",1154649600,3,456,4.625
389611,5,6301965663,"Ditto all the other good reviews. In addition, watch for

--Ted Healy and His Stooges in an appearance so early in their movie careers that Curly is still billed by his real name Jerry.

--An early (no on-screen credit) appearance by Eve Arden showing the comic genius she will become.

--Joan Crawford/Fred Astaire (in his screen debut) in ""Bavarian"" dance that MGM later recyled for Munchkinland and grand finale song-and-dance number with themes that are revisited in Emerald City sequence in Wizard of Oz.

--And of course, Robert Benchley's dry wit, which is quite a combo with the Three Stooges physical comedy.

Great film!

389612,5,6301965663,"There are a number of reasons you might find MGM's 1933 massive hit DANCING LADY entertaining. It was absolutely designed to be the most entertaining production the movies could offer in its day. MGM put together a great cast, with Joan Crawford and Clark Gable who had already proved to be box office dynamite with earlier pairings films such as POSSESSED. The amazing sexual chemistry is again much in evidence here. Gable is starting to come into his own about this time, and Crawford is continuing to grow as an actress.

The musical numbers are lovely. DANCING LADY was, after all, the film which introduced us all to the timeless standard ""Everything I Have is Yours,"" to which Crawford dances with her husband, Franchot Tone. An interesting bit of trivia about this movie: Crawford was romantically involved with both of her leading men. I think it shows on the screen!

The musical finale is also very amusing; in one number, ""That's the Rhythm of the Day,"" the performers are dressed in vintage 1700s costumes, but as they walk into town they are physically transformed into modern, depression-era Adrian designs! Horse-drawn carriages are transformed into super luxury automobiles! It is one of the most fabulous moments in the film, but there are many more!

There are many ways to find DANCING LADY entertaining, but the best aspect of the film has to be Joan Crawford's face. How people can watch this film and not be moved by it is beyond my understanding. It is one of the most exquisite faces a camera has ever captured, and quite possibly the inspiration for that remarkable picture book, ""Four Fabulous Faces.""

As an MGM musical, it's very good. As a vehicle for Joan Crawford's face, it's simply great.",1153094400,19,1722,4.846938775510204
389613,4,6301965663,"So where's the DVD???

MGM's answer to Warner Brothers' ""42nd Street"", which was released earlier in 1933.

Produced by David Selznick-

Clark Gable at his dashing, tough guy best-

Joan Crawford's fine acting and gawky dancing-

Franchot Tone's suave but unscrupulous Park Avenue beau-

Robert Benchley as a whimsical gossip columnist-

Ted Healey's brash, wise-guy humor AND

his current proteges, The Three Stooges!

PLUS the screen debuts of BOTH Fred Astaire AND Nelson Eddy--inthe SAME FILM!

Songs by Rodgers and Hart and Burton Lane (""Everything I have is Yours"")-

AND a wild, zany, over-the-top Musical Finale, including Fred and Joan dancing in the clouds on a flying-carpet which lands

(accompanied by Max-Steiner-ish ""King Kong"" music) in the middle of an old-world Bavarian beer bash:

""Here in Bavaria

They take good care-a-ya,

In all this area

Skies are clear""

all of this culminating in Rodgers'and Hart's ""That's the Rhythm of the Day"", with Nelson Eddy singing the praises of the motorized, pulse-pounding world of the ""Moderne"" age, as quaint figures from past historical eras pass under an archway and are transformed into ""hot"", jazz-age swingers!  Plenty of pre-code girlie shots, including a sequence where a chorus line of old, hobbling grannies are bopped, sawed, hacked, drilled and chopped (all in silhouette behind closed drapes in a futuristic ""beauty parlor""), thereby transforming them into young 30's-style babes, while Rodgers' music is honked out in brassy, saxophone-and- banjo-laden brilliance.

The ladies then end up riding a giant mirrored carousel in the sky, with Rodger's tune now transformed into a Tchaikovskian waltz.

And Gable and Crawford kiss for the final fade-out!

I KID YOU NOT!!

And so---will this wacky, wonderful, Depression-era delight ever be preserved on DVD, representing as it does a high-point in sheer lavish Hollywood escapism of the period? Don't hold your breath.

NOTE:  During the back-stage scenes, Larry Fine (of the 3 Stooges)plays the company's rehearsal pianist. The script includes a running gag as he works on a jig-saw puzzle on a card table during the slow periods of the rehearsals.  When he fits the last piece of the puzzle into the frame, he FINALLY realizes the puzzle's visual subject matter--- ""Oi!"" he shouts:

""It's Hitler!""

A very timely reference, since Hitler had recently been voted into power in Berlin.  I actually saw this scene in a TV print of ""Dancing Lady"" shown on a local Washington D.C. UHF station in summer of 1975; when I next saw the film--in a revival house in Chicago in 1984, the scene was MISSING.  I was even MORE suprised and disappointed upon viewing the commercial VHS release in the late 80's to find that the scene DOES NOT EXIST in the official print.  IT will probably never be seen again.",1128902400,32,2813,5.105263157894737
389614,5,6301965663,"I bought this movie to see the Three Stooges in a feature film.  What I got was quite an entertaining movie.  The Stooges appear several times in the film.  The original leader of the Stooges Ted Healy has a pretty big role as Steve.  Joan Crawford is the star and plays quite a fiery character...opposite Clark Gable.  The movie also shows the debut of Fred Astaire.  Although you see the Three Stooges many times in this film they are not featured by any means...Larry probably gets noticed the most as the piano player during Joan Crawford's dance rehearsals.  As an overall movie for 1933 standars this was absolutely excellent.  I actually thought Gable, Crawford and even Ted Healy played their roles quite well and convincingly.  It was certainly the best role I've ever seen Ted Healy in.  I recommend this movie to any early movie buff.  If you are a Stooges fan however there are probably not enough Stooges moments to keep your interest.  But if you want to see the Stooges, Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in the same movie together...well, then by all means, you need to have this.
