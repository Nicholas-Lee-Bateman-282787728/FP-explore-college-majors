8392151,4,B0039OGGYS,"My wife and I attended this concert at the Grand Ole Opry House last October, 2009.  I, so far, have only seen what my public tv station broadcast in March, but I am disappointed that they only had two Alison Krauss and Union Station numbers listed on the DVD.  They were actually the last act to perform, four hours after the show had started, and those of us still there in the audience dragged them out for two encores despite the late hour.  It was a fantastic show!  Just a little more AKUS and it would be perfect on DVD!",1271116800,4,527,4.24
8392152,5,B0039OGGYS,"This video of the 40th Anniversary concert celebrating the founding of Rounder Records is a real treat, especially if you like the kinds of music that this excellent indie label has championed over the last four decades.  Their eclectic tastes run from folk and blues to rock, bluegrass,and zydeco. They have not only jump-started careers of artists like George Thorogood and the Destroyers, but also revived careers of folks like New Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas.  This concert is actually a pastiche of new performances cut in with a few recently-recorded ones, but it's no less enjoyable for that.  The musicianship across the board is exemplary: from multi-Grammy winner banjo master Bela Fleck to bluegrass giants Alison Krauss and Union Station. (Ms. Krauss also performs a song with Robert Plant from their hugely successful collaboration ""Raising Sand"".)  Dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas is on hand too, as well as Nathan and the Zydeco Cha-chas; and actor-comedian Steve Martin, who, if you didn't already know, is a whiz on the banjo in his own right.  Singer-songwriters are well-represented by recent Rounder label-mate Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Madeleine Peyroux. Irma Thomas is in fine form as well, and Minnie Driver does a swell job as MC as well as performer.  Right up through the gospel-fueled group finale, this is an inspiring and enjoyable evening of rootsy American music, the kind that makes Rounder such a special label.
