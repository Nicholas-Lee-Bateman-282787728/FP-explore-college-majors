8240871,5,B00116VG2S,"I recently fell in love with silent movies, and the German Expressionist ones are simply the best.  Each one is just fantastically entertaining, and a world different from the talkies just a few years later.  As someone who watches new Hollywood movies too, these still hold up as great fun at the movies.

8240872,5,B00116VG2S,"This set of German Expressionist films is great cinematography from the days when Hollywood wasn't number 1. Great mood, ambience, psychic oppression present here, birthed from the womb of the deplorable experiences of  Germany's post WWI depression, which began a full decade before America's.",1373241600,3,294,5.681818181818182
8240873,5,B00116VG2S,"Before I review the movies, I must say I really enjoyed the good quality of the prints. They're generally very good throughout, allowing you to see the movies rather than the artifacts of age.

The Hands of Orlac is probably the most accessible of the 4 movies, having been remade several times.  It is a horror movie that takes a surprising turn near the end.  I love this movie for the light and shadow in its night train crash scene, and for its excellent examples of silent movie acting technique: Conrad Veidt has amazing control over the veins in his forehead and the shape of his hands.  The emotional landscape is wonderful, with every character nicely tormented, each in their own way.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a classic, so I won't say more than to say you must see it.

The Secrets of a Soul is fascinating for its history: it was basically conceived as a docu-drama about a then-new medical treatment called psychoanalysis, with one of Freud's own circle consulting throughout.  I love bits of the surreal nightmare dreamed by this otherwise very ordinary person.

Warning Shadows is a melodrama about an unfaithful wife, enraged husband, foppish suitors, and a traveling puppeteer.  Very nice use of light and shadow in the pressure-cooker of an evening at home.",1330819200,9,1282,4.790909090909091
8240874,5,B00116VG2S,Four films from the golden age of German cinema. Only Cabinet of Dr Caligari [1920 ] would be familiar too most movie fans but the other three are no less absorbing and vital. Warning Shadows [ 1923 ] by the little known Arthur Robison predates The Last Laugh [ 1924 ] in its complete absence of intertitles and Hands of Orlac [ by Caligari director Robert Weine ]benefits from a brilliant central performance from Conrad Veidt as a concert pianist who loses his arms in a train crash and has a executed murderers arms replace them. However the best movie here in my view is G.W.Pabst's Secrets of a Soul[ 1926 ] in which the great Werner Krauss plays a scientist who has an intense fear of knives and a weird compulsion to stab his beautiful wife [ the gorgeous Ruth Weyher who also appears in Warning Shadows ]. Of the four films only Caligari has any extensive special features [ though sadly i wish Kino would include audio commentaries with more of their releases ] Hands of Orlac only has a couple of text related extras and a restoration comparison while with the other two movies you get zilch! The quality of transfers is generally good and probably represent the best extant prints of these films. Caligari has some noticeable decomposition especially in the early scenes but is superior to other versions ive seen on DVD. So in short this set is well worth acquiring and at the special price offered a real bargain!,1324771200,12,1426,4.596078431372549
8240875,5,B00116VG2S,"This is quite the set of films. Considering most of the flicks in this set run $20+ by themselves, it's well worth the price.

Pefect for anyone who enjoys something outside the ordinary--and the soundtrack on The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is fantastic!",1235174400,25,251,4.837209302325581
