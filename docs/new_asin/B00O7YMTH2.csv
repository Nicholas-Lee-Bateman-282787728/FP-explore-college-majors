8682381,3,B00O7YMTH2,"Strategic Air Command, 1955 film

It begins at a baseball field, there is an inter-squad game. A big four-engine bomber flies overhead. A general arrives, he explains his mission. They need mature experienced leaders. Dutch is told why they want him and others for 21 months of active duty. This affects his baseball career. His wife supports his choice. Dutch reports to Carswell Air Force base. Holland doesnt look like hi picture; his old uniform was the wrong color. SAC bases are restricted. A DC-3 lands, men pur out of the plane. This is a test by General Hawks. Lt. Col. Holland will learn to fly a B-36. Sally his wife telephones. Dutch and others are given physical tests. Dutch pilots a B-36, which has six propeller engines and four jet engines for extra power for take-off.

It was replaced by the B-47 and the B-52, powered by jet engines. It flies at 40,000 feet. One airman will retire, he misses his family. They show the insides of this huge airplane. They must be ready 24 hours a day seven days a week. [How long does it take to arm this bomber?] The B-36 lands at dusk after a round trip to Alaska. Dutch flies a B-36 to Thule, Greenland, for cold weather tests. There is a fuel leak that threatens the plane! Its 42 degrees below zero. There is a fire in the port engine, it spreads to the wing. The crew bails out, Dutch will try a crash landing on the icy lands. Dutch sees the new B-47 jet bomber. The B-47 has only a three-man crew. It takes off into the wild blue yonder and flies at 43,000 feet (eight miles high). Thee is a test mission for many B-47 bombers.

Dutch will stay in the Air Force permanently. Sally objects to his sole decision. [His sore arm could put an end to his baseball career.] A fuel tanker will refill their fuel tanks in the air. Other airmen will stay in the Air Force. They run into a jet stream and must fly lower. There is a problem with the weather, a low ceiling that can handicap a landing. Pilot Dutch has a problem with his right arm! Fuel is running low too! Radar will guide the bomber to a landing in Okinawa, he is given directions for landing. Dutchs chronic condition will send him to Omaha. He should have reported to medical about his condition. Dutchs career is over, he will return to civilian life. Sally greets him. General Hawks says Dutch should make a good baseball manager.

James Stewart served in the Army Air Force during WW II as a bomber pilot. After the war he returned to his career as a Hollywood movie actor. Did he sort of play the same character in many of his movies? But this is what made him popular and famous. The Strategic Air Command was designed to respond in case of an attack on the USA. In time they would be replaced by Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, an example of a machine replacing men (who might balk at unleashing a nuclear war, or be vulnerable to enemy defense actions). But once launched they could not be recalled like human pilots. [Why couldn't this be included into the design?]",1477440000,,2997,4.443636363636363

8682387,1,B00O7YMTH2,"did not understand purchase page, not an adequate description of what I purchased.  A waste of time and money.  Thought I was buying an English spoken movie!",1459123200,,157,4.777777777777778
8682388,5,B00O7YMTH2,"I have seen this movie many times, and as a USAF veteran who was stationed at a SAC base (Grand Forks, North Dakota) during the Cuban Missile Crisis (and boy, what a hairy ride THAT was!), it is a perennial favorite with me!  I currently have it saved to my Tivo and watch it that way.  And I can't believe that I have to be relegated to buying this fine film from overseas in a NON-Region-1 format... and for a high price!  (Fortunately, since they are easy to obtain at a low price, I DO have a region-free DVD player that will accommodate it, and have had it for many years.  That ""region"" nonsense id a joke!!)

  Ironically, as SAC films go, this one hasn't been alone in such a regard. Another one that's an equal favorite of mine is ""A Gathering of Eagles,"" and it took virtually forever for that one as well to become available as a Region 1.  I finally was able to obtain it that way a few months ago, and it's still fully available.  THIS film (""Strategic Air Command"") depicts how SAC functioned from a pilot's perspective during the Cold War, in the '50s and '60s, and ""A Gathering of Eagles"" depicts the way SAC Wings and their wing commanders had to be ever-sharp and were kept on their toes by surprise ORIs --- Operational-Readiness Inspections --- that tested their mettle in real-time for days on end.  To get a good perspective of life in SAC as air officers and flight-crew members, you need to watch (and hopefully own) BOTH of these excellent productions.  If you've been in the Air Force, are a student of or remember the Cold War, or even if you simply LOVE to FLY, both of these films will be a joy for you to possess and view again and again.  (And what great cinematography and soundtracks!!)  The studios OWE us this film in Region 1 DVD and Blu-Ray.  ASAP!",1458259200,4,1785,4.386018237082067
