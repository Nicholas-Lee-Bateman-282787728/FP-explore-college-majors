7956179,3,B00005V9JC,"I purchased this movie after skiing Park Cities with 7 buddies two weeks after the Olympics.  I am not a master skier, having only skied 4 times in my life (3 days each time), but I did manage to get down a double diamond, do the half pipe twice and attempt some jumps this year.
I bought the movie for (1) motivation for next year - I have some conditioning to work on and (2) to play with some buddies while sitting around.  Pop it in and bring back the memories.  Of course, we are nowhere near as good as these guys but 2 of them in our group were catching SERIOUS air and one did a full 360 and landed it!
I am ranking it 3 stars because I wish that the movie had more footage of HUGE tricks and a better soundtrack to the movie.  In my opinion there is a lot of time that is wasted showing non-tricks and footage that isn't that great.  The first 15 minutes isn't that exciting but the movie gets better once you get past the first 15 minutes.
The highlights of the movie is that they ski some SERIOUSLY STEEP slopes and do some major drops with quite a few tricks toward the latter half of the movie.
If you are looking for a movie to get motivated about skiing this one might do the trick but I will look for a better ski flick.  Some of the movies we saw on the TVs, while in the Park Cities bars at night, blew this movie away.
Ski movie and Ski Movie 2 have been recommended to me by a friend who owns alot of these movies.  Hope this helps.",1017014400,,1452,4.020833333333333
7956180,5,B00005V9JC,This video is absolutly amazing to watch.  The stunts and specticles performed in this video can't help but make your jaw drop.  People are decending the mountain at angles that are just ridiculous.  A great watch for sure.,1011139200,2,223,4.815789473684211
