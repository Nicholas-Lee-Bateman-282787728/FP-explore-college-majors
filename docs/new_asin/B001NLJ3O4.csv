3719546,5,B001NLJ3O4,"I WATCHED IT ON BLACK HISTORY. I CAN NOT REMEMBER THE CHANNEL. THE BLACK HUSBAND TRIED TO FORGET ABOUT HIS DAD'S DEATH BUT FORGOT WHERE HE CAME FROM FOR SOME TIME. LONG STORY SHORTENED, WATCH THE MOVIE.",1270857600,,202,4.486486486486487
3719547,3,B001NLJ3O4,"It was an okay DVD, but would have not been to happy seeing it on the Big Screen. The action was well done, and had well know actors/actress.
Its about a small town that don't want to let go of the pass. People willing to make money off others to make it, not caring about who you have to step on, with lust, sin, bitterness, and a little love.
A good early noon Sat watch. It was worth the $6.00 to own another African American DVD.",1261180800,,433,4.046511627906977

3719549,5,B001NLJ3O4,"I loved watching ""Gospel Hill..."" I am from South Carolina and I did not even know nor heard of this TRUE event...  Thanks",1242604800,9,122,4.304347826086956
3719550,3,B001NLJ3O4,Not what I thought it would be about.  When I watched the previews I thought it would different.  Was an O.K. movie.  Great actors and actresses.,1239580800,,145,4.5
3719551,4,B001NLJ3O4,"Gospel Hill is a community in the small town of Julia. The people there have lived in their homes for generations. The Valley Corporation plans to build on Gospel Hill, so they want to buy these people out, not caring that many of them have no place else to go. Displacing an African-American community means nothing to these developers, while profiting from the new homes and golf course they plan to build means everything. That is called ""the love of money"", which is the root of all evil.
Instead of fighting to save Gospel Hill, Dr. Ron Palmer (Giancarlo Esposito) joins the developers, making money by taking advantage of the less fortunate and calling it opportunity. Sarah Malcolm (Angela Bassett) takes a stand against the Valley Corporation. Her husband, John (Danny Glover) shows very little support. He lost his passion to fight for what's right years ago when his father, Paul, was gunned down and left to bleed to death in the street. The 40th anniversary of his father's death is approaching but he's not sure he can bring himself to attend the ceremony to honor Paul Malcolm's legacy. John has to work through the pain he's been feeling for so long. Will he do it in time to save his wife, whose life is in danger?
This movie goes from present to past. The past focuses on Paul Malcolm (Samuel L. Jackson), an activist for social justice, and it's filmed in black & white - nice effect.
There wasn't as much intensity as I expected for a movie dealing with racial issues, and that was fine because although I was a bit bothered by some of the content I wasn't left feeling angry.
Not a whole lot of profanity. Sex scenes weren't graphic. Love Angela Bassett and the strong woman she portrayed. Church scene was touching. Gospel Hill is a good movie worth watching.",1234483200,38,1780,4.653968253968254
3719552,5,B001NLJ3O4,The movie has an excellent cast; a great story; marvelously directed and beautifully filmed.  It is a story for our time.,1234224000,16,121,4.761904761904762

3719558,5,B001NLJ3O4,"The movie was awesome, as it depicted the many cover-ups of those ancients in racism. This movie also details the struggles of addressing racism and how to deal with it.",1404000000,,169,4.666666666666667
3719559,3,B001NLJ3O4,This movie was okay.  It really wasn't what I expeced. The acting was good as well. There was one actress that I didn' t recognize at first and (Nia Long) she didn't have a big part.,1400457600,,182,4.055555555555555
3719560,2,B001NLJ3O4,"The story never went anywhere. Was it a mystery or a movie of reconciliation? It just chugged along and then petered out at the end. When the schoolteacher tells the guy she is dating she is breaking up with him not because of anything he has done but for who he is, it was ridiculous. It was a waste of some good talent.",1396137600,,321,4.111111111111111
3719561,3,B001NLJ3O4,"I chose three stars because I felt it was slow getting to the point. The cast was good, story believable since I grew up in the 50's. I passed it on to a friend.",1379462400,,161,3.764705882352941
3719562,4,B001NLJ3O4,"Well acted and inspirational film.  While a bit predictable, the characters were believable.  The previews drew me in, and the film did not disappoint me.",1375056000,,154,5.12
3719563,5,B001NLJ3O4,I loved Angela in her movies she is a great actor.  I know this was probably something that happens to a lot of  us back in the 50's people taking advantage of us but stand your ground stand together we can make a change ...money  should never be a reason to sell each other out...,1364169600,,281,4.072727272727272
3719564,2,B001NLJ3O4,"As much as I love Danny Glover and even Taylor Kitsch, this movie wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Deals with racism and it's effect on people all these years later. This whole movie I felt the build up like something bad was just waiting to happen, which thankfully it didn't, but once you get to the end, nothing happened. You get to the end and it's like blerp.....Worth a rent, not a buy personally.",1362441600,3,412,4.294871794871795
3719565,5,B001NLJ3O4,This was a very interesting movie.  Started out slow but the movie picked up and I really enjoyed it so I would suggest movie lovers who like the later life settings view it.,1361145600,,174,4.2727272727272725
3719566,3,B001NLJ3O4,Gospel Hill is a pretty good movie. The stars were awesome. I like it. It wasn't what I thought it would be but I have no complaints.,1359590400,,133,3.962962962962963
3719567,3,B001NLJ3O4,"The Actors are great, The Story is good, but the movie did not flow well to me. It was worth one viewing but,I probably won't watch it again.",1349136000,,141,4.071428571428571
3719568,5,B001NLJ3O4,"Apart from being moving and atmospheric, and taking you to the Deep South to the point that you feel the humid tropical heat, it is above all a complex and humanly satisfying film.

I liked that there are several stories in one.

The characters too, are developed in ways that are complex, as far as film characters go. The picture is never just black or white (no pun intended!).

There are compassionate developments and in the end, each characters' point of view is brought to light and made to some degree understandable - if not excusable. Weakness and fear are more often found at the source, rather than hate or sheer racial prejudice.

Issues of deeply personal integrity are tackled, intelligently and passionately, culminating in the last dialogue between Rosie and Joel. This lifted the film to yet another level for me.

My only gripe is that it abruptly came to an end when I thought I still had another half hour to watch and I felt frustrated - although the film isn't shorter than average.

However ""abrupt"" it may have felt, the ending is satisfying; nothing ends precisely as you'd expect, but close enough (only with a bit more complexity); emotion is toned down in a subtle and tasteful way so that, although rather a success story it's not the tear jerker it could have been, had the story been treated in the classic, expected way.
(You don't end up mad with anger either, or depressed, on account of the subject - you're given glimpses of both human weakness and greatness, which leaves you on a refreshingly positive note).

And finally, as has been already said by Amazon reviewers, all the acting is fantastic.",1335744000,2,1636,4.719298245614035
3719569,1,B001NLJ3O4,Several uses of the F word in a short time along with milder (but still unacceptable) profanity  make this movie unsuitable for family viewing. If a rating or a warning was present indicating the presence of foul language I would simply have turned it off.  Since I wasted my money and time on a movie of this nature I feel cheated.  I stopped it after playing only a short time.  It's a shame but this is just another movie with great acting and a real message that's trashed up and it had real potential.,1321488000,,506,4.351063829787234
3719570,5,B001NLJ3O4,I had saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and was quite interested.  I like the mixture of the cast members on this type of movie.,1319587200,,149,4.137931034482759
3719571,4,B001NLJ3O4,"This DVD purchase was a good choice. It carried with it great acting, and drama throughout. The emphasis was based upon a true story which will leave you desiring to go into it a little deeper. It is heart moving and shares with its viewers how racism was handled, misjudged, and highly stressful for an innocent.
Highly recommended for the mind of the integrity.",1297382400,,363,4.6875
3719572,4,B001NLJ3O4,"I enjoyed this movie.  The movie depicted that even when you or a family member is wronged; you don't have to resort to that person's level.  With restraint, resolve and compassion for another human being; you can get past a grave injustice.",1296864000,,241,4.714285714285714

8327302,1,B001NLJ3O4,"Well, I had anticipating seeing this movie due to all the fantastic actors in it but this movie was as lame as they come. I am shocked at how boring and lackluster this was. The writing was choppy and the scenes were so short that you couldn't get into the flow of the film before a scene jumped to something else. There were many issues with this movie. For one, there were too many actors and stories going on. The film was supposed to center around the anniversary of Danny Glover's father's death but it became overshadowed by all this other nonsense. There were WAY too many conflicting storylines, which were confusing and unnecessary. I don't understand the point of Adam Baldwin and Nia Long's characters having an affair when it brought nothing to the story. The two weren't even shown that much. Julia Styles was as dry as a cracker and the guy who played her love interest couldn't act to save his life. I'd never seen him before and wondered where they got him from. Angela Bassett always shines no matter how bad the movie is (and she's been in some dogs!) but even her performance couldn't save this crappy flick. Danny Glover hasn't been good since the 90's. The more he ages, the more boring he gets. He acts the same on everything these days. Samuel L. Jackson was good and he should've played Glover's role if you ask me.

This movie is full of very good actors so it had tons of potential but it was a waste of time to even make this film if you ask me. Also it seemed kind of low budget like something you'd see on the Hallmark channel, which also threw me off.",1456272000,,1581,4.395904436860068

8327305,3,B001NLJ3O4,"Good story, bad execution. They had characters that went nowhere, It was choppy, the differences between the races were clear, but the old hatreds were not. It seemed like everything was implied, but nothing was clear. I gave it three stars because the message was clear, but if I based it off of the artwork alone, I would have given it only two stars.",1435449600,,353,4.53125
