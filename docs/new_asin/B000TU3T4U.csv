8210946,5,B000TU3T4U,"Bravo Virginia Brooks.  The Nutcracker Family is a wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary which will be enjoyed by anyone interested in ballet and certainly any family with children taking ballet classes.  The film concentrates on the children of the School of American Ballet who perform in the New York City Ballet's annual Nutcracker and follows them from audition through rehearsals, costume fittings, final run-throughs and up to opening night.  The enthusiasm of these children speaks for itself. Just being a cute kid is not enough at City Ballet.  All of the children are first and foremost dedicated, hard-working dancers who take on a lot of responsibility and do not disappoint.

In addition, the film includes reminiscences by former child castmembers, rehearsal footage of Jennie Somogyi and Peter Boal and archival footage of Mr. Balanchine himself directing a dress rehearsal in 1970.",1225929600,5,900,5.446043165467626
