1425699,4,B00005IBCP,"I really like the movie, it portrayed the book pretty good for the most part...emphasizing on the word ""most"".
I do have to question the sanity of some of the people who directed the movie though.  I can understand that they had to cram it into a 92 minute video, but some parts had absolutely nothing to do with the book.  But I won't go into detail.
Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, just...nevermind.
To tell the truth, I'm just getting the DVD because I am a collector of everything that has to do with Watership Down.",1017360000,,529,4.28
1425700,3,B00005IBCP,"I'm not writing to encourage anyone to see this film if they haven't already -- other folks have already done that.
However, I will say that I was 15 or 16 when this film was released in the theaters in the U.S., and I saw it four times in the one week that it ran.  Afterwards, I bought the novel, the picture book from the film, and the soundtrack.  I love this movie.
So I was excited to see that it was finally being released on DVD.
It arrived today and I promptly popped it into my DVD player.
While it certainly doesn't harm the film, there obviously were no extra expenses put into transferring this film to DVD.  The DVD extras are minimal, and even a little frustrating.  For example, there's a brief glossary of rabbit language (lapine), but they don't explain several of the words that are used in the film, while they do explain a few that are not.  This is not a problem, as the words in question can be intuitively translated; but it seems to me that whoever compiled the glossary hadn't watched the film, just picked out a few words from the back of the novel.
Much more importantly, the video quality is no better than that on the VHS copy (IMHO), and the audio quality is worse.  Don't get me wrong; I didn't expect 5.1 audio, and the audio quality isn't horrible.  My only real complaint about is that I had to raise the volume on my digital processor/receiver significantly more than usual, in order to get the soundtrack to a comfortable level.
So my recommendation is: if you already have Watership Down on VHS, you'll probably be perfectly satisfied with that, unless you're a diehard ""letterbox"" fanatic like myself.  If you don't have it in either format, you can't go wrong either way.  To further summarize, if the DVD wasn't letterboxed, I'd probably be pretty mad right now.",1017360000,3,1803,4.506134969325154
1425701,2,B00005IBCP,"For fans of _Watership Down_, the opportunity to see this film on DVD will be too good to pass up.  If you are one of those who must buy this DVD, by all means don't let me stop you.  But may I offer a few caveats for the rest of us?

The main problem with this film (as with the book) is that it doesn't know whether it's a beast fable or an attempt at realistic depictions of nature.  With such a profound identity crisis on the story level, it's no surprise that the animation veers unevenly between caricature and photorealism.  Parents take note: This film is too grisly for children _and_ too cutesy for adults.

The first half of _Watership Down_ is a road movie, and a frequently entertaining one at that.  But the second half, when the story becomes a simplistic political allegory, falls apart.  Director Martin Rosen doesn't have a tight grasp of the material; apparently, Rosen replaced animation great John Hubley early in the production, and is responsible for everything but the prologue.  A few years later Rosen would fare better with the far superior but little-seen _Plague Dogs_ (available in truncated form on a bare-bones DVD).

Despite the film's many shortcomings, animation buffs like me will find _Watership Down_ worth a rental, if only for John Hubley's remarkable prologue.  In an avant-garde departure from traditional animation, Hubley uses Haida-influenced artwork to tell a myth on the origin of rabbits.  Although this particular set piece has no relevance to the rest of the film, it's a classic bit of animation in its own right.  It also leaves you to wonder what might have happened had Hubley supervised the entire film.",1016150400,3,1659,4.799295774647887
1425702,5,B00005IBCP,"Well, I can't really add much more to the praise heaped on this magnificent film. I first saw it in Camberley at a school screening when I was 7 and adored it. To be honest although I remember being a little scared I think a lot of it went over my head. I would say to any parent, show it to your child from 5 upwards, just be with them in case they find it disturbing.
It was only a couple of years later that it had the most profound effect on me, even going so far as forcing my parents to take me to the downs to look for fiver et al, it's one of the most brilliant movies of all time and knocks socks off any 'Moral message' Disney tries to deliver every time. I've got this film on video but have only been able to watch it a couple of times since, to the guy that said anyone with a pulse would always cry at Bright Eyes and the ending...Word!  Just to read these reviews has brought tears to my eyes!  Am so glad it's finally coming out on DVD and I'll be in the  US to buy it! Wonderful wonderful wonderful!",1014595200,4,1016,3.946341463414634
1425703,5,B00005IBCP,"I just finished reading the book for the eighth time, and am eagerly awaiting the release of Watership Down on DVD in March.  This novel is not about rabbits.  It merely uses rabbits as characters to illustrate struggles that we all undergo at one time in our lives in some way or another.  It is the superbly told story of everything and everyone that has ever lived.  There is something for everyone in this story.  Blackberry, the smart one.  Bigwig, the strong one.  Fiver, the wise one.  And of course, Hazel, the one to bring all their talents together to make a band of individuals that cannot fail in their mission to survive.  The lessons they learn along the way about each other and themselves strike a chord of understanding and recognition in me.  Every time I read the novel, I get something new out of it.  You certainly would not waste your time to see what this is all about.",1013731200,,892,4.478260869565218
1425704,5,B00005IBCP,"Definitely not for young children, this is an adult animation -- ""adult"" as in mature themes and not pornographic.  The animated movie itself follows the book very closely - all the way down to the ""rabbit language"" which the book provides a glossary for, yet this movie directs it in the way where not knowing ""rabbit language"" doesn't take away from it.
The way it's animated is not traditional and very emotionally abstract, so don't call this a cartoon or even a family film.  It's not a ""cutesy"" tale about rabbits but a drama and a statement about culture and society.  Very oriented on the foundations of culture and folktales (where even the rabbits have their own spiritual beliefs and tales they tell around the ""campfire"").
Although I saw this years ago, I have the video (and am getting the DVD) and even now I the story and direction is riveting and moving.  Deep, exciting, and not boring (unless you're from the Steven Seagle/Rambo set), this is a must-have for your collection.
FYI- some glossary terms:
-Rah: a title of royalty (as in ""Hazel-rah"" meaning Prince Hazel)
Roo-doo-doo: automobiles, cars
Hombre: a badger
krakkar: a swear word for rabbits",1011916800,,1167,4.849246231155779

1425711,5,B00005IBCP,"This is one of my favorite movies of ALL TIME!! Now it could be said by some that there are mildly violent or disturbing scenes. It actually does come across as ""Rabbit War"" at the end, but the rabbits are fighting for their home and their freedom. Many of man's human plights, such as oppression, over population, and military tyranny are portrayed in the lives of the rabbits. You could have just as easily replaced them with real people and you'd still have a good ""story"". But against all odds where death and violence are an everyday part of the circle of life, hope prevails! The rabbits have such a strong spirit you just can't help but root for them as they seek their new home, high on a hill.

The scenery/animation is beautiful and reminds me of a picture of the English countryside done in watercolors similar to the world of Peter Rabbit, by Beatrix Potter. The music is both soothing and haunting at the same time. Art Garfunkel's ""Bright Eyes"" makes me cry. I have been watching this movie for over 20 years.

It has themes of social order, personal responsibility, socialism and religion a la ""1984"", but it is set in the world of animals, so I can see why it was made as an animated movie. It has always been a favorite, but please don't mistake the cartoon~ish cover for a child's movie. There is graphic violence (fighting, blood, killings, death), sex (not seen, but implied as rewards for the privileged few), Big Brother-type punishments (public humiliation) and other social commentary that would be inappropriate fro those under age 14-15 or so (IMO).",1442188800,,648,4.794642857142857

1425735,5,B00005IBCP,"WaterShip Down is a beautiful classic. The animation is realistic and gorgeous. HOWEVER, even though I love it doesn't mean everyone will. Do not let this movie about 'cute bunnies' fool you. This movie is animated, on the children's section in stores and is about rabbits. It seems to scream Children's film. This movie is NOT for children. It can even be frightening for adults.

It contains gore, blood and frightening scenes. You see a scene where dead rabbits are all crammed together in a blocked burrow, you see a dog rip rabbits from limb to limb, you see two rabbits fight, blood everywhere. It is a classic, has a very good plot.

The plot is realistic and even has a bit of a Bible like opening. The great Frith in this film is technically God in real life the way its told.

Plus the characters are very loveable, Bigwig is my favorite. I can't give a pacific age restriction for this movie, but certainly not for people under 15. And not for people who can't handle gore. But for people who have strong stomachs and enjoy a good drama, this is the movie for them.",1385769600,,1076,4.479591836734694

A movie about bunnies can't be that bad, right?  I have five children and this was by far one of the creepiest movies we have ever watched.  My oldest who is 13 was the first to say that this was not a children's movie.  I'd say it's not for anyone else either!

The animation was definitely of 70's caliber (not good) but on top of that it was extremely creepy. Lots of vampire-eyed bunnies and dead or dying, bloody bunnies.  There were ghost bunnies, zombie-like bunnies, and a beloved bunny that gets snatched by a hawk.  And there were bunnies attacking each other, tearing fur out and leaving bloody scratches.  I knew the creep factor would be huge when the movie started out with the clairvoyant bunny having a premonition that blood will cover the field where the bunnies are living.  We don't know why he's having this vision but several bunnies become freaked out by it and they decide to leave against the will of their creepy dictator bunny.  What follows is strange, scary, bloody and just plain makes no sense.  Please do not show this to your young children or waste your time on it.

The rabbits have realistic structures and move very smoothly almost like a real life rabbit would. The only other movie I've seen besides Plague dogs that come close to this is this old Peter Rabbit movie I loved when I was little and it can't compare to this. The story is very dark which is an added plus because most animated films are often cutesy and carefree, but in this there's always a sense of danger and its unpredictable. Being a Warriors fan I couldn't help but wonder if Erin Hunter found inspiration from this story and put some of that in her books (When Firestar is caught in a fox trap). The end of this movie actually drove me to tears. If you love this then I also recommend Plague Dogs which I believe is even darker.

Many here make this film out to be horrifying, it ISN'T!! There are a few mildly disturbing scenes towards the end of the movie but nothing my five year old cannot handle. We live in the country and we see death quite often. We have seen rabbits, cats, dogs, birds, snakes, turtles, frogs, squirrels and other critters dead or dying. Death is a part of life, why shy from it?... or worse, teach your children to be terrified of it? I have to say, we also have pet rabbits and this movie did not upset my children. My retriever has killed animals before, that is what dogs do sometimes. It can be pretty upsetting...but children need to be aware that these things happen.

I have always liked bunnies, so I guess she thought it would be a good movie for me. Cute fuzzy bunnies... what could be wrong? So she sat me in front of it and went to do chores or something.
I was mortified by what I saw. Bloody grisly gory. Rabbits scratching and clawing one another, ripping each other to shreds. Every last disgusting detail is shown. The scene that I remember most vividly is Bigwig caught in a snare, blood streaming out of this neck and mouth. I cried and cried. Eventually I turned it off. I have always had bad memories of it. Finally, at 19, I got enough courage to watch it again, hoping I would find it better than what I remembered. Wrong. 11 years later I still find it as ugly and repulsive as ever. Quite frankly, it is disgusting. I hate the grisliness of it all. I hate the blood and the shooting, mauling, scratching, clawing and dying. I do not consider myself a squeamish person, but this is nasty. It should of been rated R. Don't put yourself through the torture of watching this.

1425762,4,B00005IBCP,"Watership Down is listed in listed in the on some sites in the Family/Children Category and in my opinion it should not be. It should be listed under Anime/Animation. This is a wonderful movie & animation was the most logical format for the story considering the setting & characters. But, I think the subject matter is far too mature for young kids to grasp. It is slow in some parts that children may find boring & even I was disturbed by some of the violence portrayed in the film. It's very unusual to see rabbits tearing each other apart (perhaps that is precisely the reason Richard Adams chose rabbits for his story). I would highly suggest to parents, watch the movie on your own prior to showing it to your kids to determine if it is suitable for them. You know your kid best. I do however, think it's appropriate for kids 11 years old and up.

The animation in the movie may not live up to today's standards, but the animators took great care in their work. This is most obvious in the impressive way they animated the rabbits' movements. I have owned pet rabbits since I was a little girl & I can say with a great amount of certainty that the movements & natural rabbit behavior was animated not only beautifully, but realistically as well.

There are so many valuable lessons pointed out in this movie that are directly related to the Human Condition such as fighting tyrannical authority, standing up for what you believe in, friendship, following your own path, the pursuit of happiness etc. But one issue that hasn't been discussed much here that is very relevant is the film's portrayal of how humans are so apathetic towards their environment & fellow creatures. A great example of this is in my favorite scene when Captain Holly locates the wayward bunnies & recounts to them how the humans destroyed the warren. BigWig then says ""Humans have always hated us,"" & ever so poignantly Holly replies, ""no. We were just in their way."" This film is disturbing yet, inspiring & thought provoking. It will affect all who view it.

The Soundtrack:  The score is pretty standard as far animated features go.  Each musical piece is emotionally appropriate to each scene it's matched with.  Nothing incredibly memorable, however.  And there is strange interlude mid-film which contains the musical ""highlight"" of the film, a song called ""Bright Eyes"" sung by the legendary Art Garfunkel (you can tell this movies was made the year I was born 1978, my mom was a huge Garfunkel fan!).

DVD Special Features:  The DVD that I watched was released in March 26, 2002.  For those of you who are big fans of the ""WD"" saga (Jenn that means you should pay attention, LOL) a deluxe collector's edition with filmmaker interviews and other interesting bonus material will be released October 7, 2008.  The particular release I watched extremely lacking in entertaining or informative extra footage but here's a brief rundown anyway:

Richard Adams Profile:  A brief biography about and list of other written works of the book's author.

""Watership Down Today"":  A brief history & geography lesson on the actual location.

Theatrical Trailer:  I think this one is self-explanatory.

Bunny Talk Glossary:  The most useful of all the bonus material.  If you are unfamiliar with Watership Down you should know that the Rabbits have their own language & religion.  I would highly suggest that newbies to this story peruse this Rabbit-to-English Translation Guide before viewing the film.

Just ignore those people who cry out against the violence because there is plenty of it in the book and plenty of talking about it too. I just recently read the damn thing before watching the movie so I should know as good as anyone.
I can go on and on about how much it ""annoys"" me (though I can think of many other creative words) that everyone expects a g/pg movie that ""the whole family"" can enjoy when it comes to animation. Well I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and if it scares your kids (it kind of freaked me out) then so be it, life can be scary people and animals die everyday get over it.
So I say it one more time. Despite what others say this book follows the plot as close as any movie could for when it was made. And that is saying allot since it came out in 1978 and has influenced a number of people since then because this isn't a cute story about some wacky rabbits this a story that can be compared to any story that involves humans as much as any Pixar film.",1186099200,2,1232,4.0699588477366255

1425774,5,B00005IBCP,"I sat down for the first time at 33 years old, to watch the movie Watership Down.  The movie is fairly close to the book as far as accuracy, or as far as production can put into a 90 minute movie.  The movie has a sort of political dissonance to it, with almost a Marxist theme.  The story portrays a rabbit named Hazel, his younger brother Fiver, and a host of other rabbits that grow leery of man's encroachment upon their warren.  At the suggestion of the prophetic Fiver, the rabbits leave the warren to seek sancuary at a safer place known as the Hills.  Set in England's Downs area, we see these courageous rabbits overcome struggle, grief, turmoil and a host of natural predators, including man himself, in order to find what they could percieve as their own space within the world.  Some of the predators that you see in this movie are also other rabbits, led by the nefarious and dictatorial General Woundwort, a cruel and fierce rabbit with a mind like a razor, and claws to match.  As all these adversaries work for the demise of Hazel, Fiver, Blackberry, Bigwig and the host of other rabbits striving for their own life of freedom, Hazel becomes the epitome of what a leader can be.  Humanistic mentalities and personalities are abound in the movie, through a realistic approach to an almost magical tale of life, death, sorrow, joy and above all, love; all of the experiences that humans can endure, but through the eyes of rabbits.  At the very end we see Hazel, old with age and tired; he is asked by El-ahrairah, the revered mythological rabbit prince, to join him within his Owsla , and to live eternally at peace in the fields of his lord forever.

1425775,3,B00005IBCP,"If Sam Peckinpah had been an animator, he might have come up with something like Watership Down. There's less violence than I recalled, but what there is is still shockingly bloodthirsty - you could easily retitle this The Wild Bunnies once general Woundwort and Bigwig start tearing chunks out of each other, jaws dripping with blood. It's not as good as the same team's subsequent much-vilified box-office disaster The Plague Dogs (only available in the cut US version on DVD outside Australia), but it's importance as a major step away from safe and friendly children's fare in animation can't be underestimated: in many ways, this is an adult drama that just happens to be about rabbits and just happens to be animated rather than an animated film per se.

That's not to say there aren't some striking moments of pure visual imagination, from the early rabbit version of the Creation myth to the nightmarish gassing and destruction of the warren, but this is a film where sudden death is a constant companion and survival is a tough business and an unlikely prospect - even the Bright Eyes moment accompanies a character pursued by death. Impressive stuff, but definitely not one to show the very little `uns unaccompanied.

Sadly, neither the excellent audio commentary from the Australian DVD nor the interviews from the UK DVD are included on the US DVD - hence only three stars.",1157760000,5,1386,4.8936170212765955

The filmmakers left out a lot of the book--but all films do this due to time constraints and the different media. I also understand the criticism regarding the rabbit mythology but I think that would have cluttered the film. (Blade Runner, an adapation of a novel by Phillip K. Dick, wasn't really close at all to the original story, which also had significant religious themes, but the movie is excellent.)

1425786,2,B00005IBCP,"The makers of this film tried to follow the book closely but chose to leave out much the rich transcendent mythology that was one of Adams' most creative innovations in the book. As the book unfolded, the myths of El Arirah (sp?) and the other animals and the central deity were told during lulls in the narrative. By the time the reader finished the book he/she had a good grip on the metaphysical underpinnings of Hazel's world. In the film when the Black Rabbit of Inlay comes for Hazel at the end, he calls to mind a squiggly trick kite rather than the daunting inevitable figure that escorts rabbits into death and ""heaven.""

The film's strengths are the beautiful watercolor scenes against which the narrative plays out, evoking classic British children's book illustration. I also felt the violence of the animal world was given credence without going over the top - though the animators pushed the limit. The film ought to have a PG rating.

But finally, it is the jerky editing and reduced, crammed and hurried narrative that make this film version of WD an uneven effort at best. Moreover, in the DVD my family viewed, the musical score swells intrusively, occasionally obscuring the (under-miked?) lines of the actors.  The seagull's dialect is understandable only half of the time -- in Adams' text the reader was able to translate with minimal effort.

This is the kind of book that really needed the resources of Disney's animators to translate it successfully to the screen. Think of the look of ""Brother Bear,"" one of Disney's last drawn animated films, and you'll - so to speak - get the picture. Though the risk with a Disney treatment would bring a sentimentalizing tendency that would endanger the tone of Adams' novel, I am tempted to think that would still be a better result than this sketchy effort.

It is interesting, then, to note that it is the religion that the writers/producers chose to remove (censor?) from the film version.  The relgious aspects give another dimension into these rabbits' lives, and therefore, somewhat of an insight into our own lives.

For adults, however, WATERSHIP DOWN is a refreshing change of pace in the cutesy animals animated field.

1425793,1,B00005IBCP,"The movie does not connect well with the rich mythology of the Adams story.

There is an attempt with the opening narrative to link the rabbits creation myth and the plot together.  It fails rather handily.

Although the rabbits' oral histories is perhaps the most endearing part of the novel, little place is found for them and thus the film starts out crippled. There is almost no character development in the film.  As a result the film has little emotional impact.

The artwork is not good.  There are a few rather pretty but flat pastoral settings but the rabbits are drawn so repellently that they detract from the scenery.  There is almost a sense of relief when they are out of a shot.

Fiver, in particular, is depicted as a nasty, quivering bit of grunge.

Underground scenes are a maze of lines where the eye is lead nowhere and the rendering is unhelpful to the plot.

Adams deserves better.  No doubt, someday, someone will make a movie that captures the spirit and the wonder of this classic book - perhaps a talent like Jackson brought to the Lord of the Rings.  But this film is NOT it.  It may even be depressing or frightening to young children.",1125446400,2,1163,4.5603864734299515
1425794,5,B00005IBCP,"Picture this, its 1980 I am 7 years old, Tallahassee Florida. My three sisters and I sit down in our brown carpeted living room to watch TV. There is a cartoon coming on and my mother sees that it's going to be about rabbits, harmless rabbits. She goes upstairs to clean or whatever moms do out of sight for hours and make a lot of noise. We all sit there in our bean bags (we all had our own, mine was yellow) and watch the movie. All I remember at that time was Bloody fields, BigWig, Fiver going nutso, Tractors, Evil cats, a Seagull, Traps, Boats, Weird Words, more Blood, Scary Rabbits, Torn Ears, the Black rabbit, crying....its all in flashes, and by the end of it I was never the same. We all went upstairs crying, my mother is listening to our synopsis and is so very confused (she never read the book) weren't we just watching a cartoon about fuzzy rabbits?

 I read the book 5 years later, and really understood what it was all about, I understood the weird words, and the journey, and the friendship, the family, the need to be free, the whole thing. I also watched the movie again, strangely I didn't remember seeing the beginning about Frith and El-Ahrairah, it was just as bloody and wonderful and it was even more heartbreaking then I remember, I cried my eyes out, but this time I was different, older, wiser and well read, and I adored the whole Warren of Rabbits like they were family. Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Holly, Blackberry, Silver, Pipkin, Dandelion, Cowslip, Clover, Hyzenthlay, Gen Woundwort, Sherbil, Campion, Blackavar, and Kehaar. All names I have committed to memory all characters that dug little tunnels into my psyche. I swear I have never been as terrified of a bad guy like I am of Woundwort; no slasher movie villain can touch the pure hatred and seething evil he is surrounded with.

 My sister recently came to my house with my 7 year old niece and she saw my copy and wanted to watch it, I said ""that's not a movie for kids"" and its not. I will wait a couple more years to show it to her.",1124323200,6,2025,4.420911528150134
1425795,3,B00005IBCP,"Watership Down was a fairly good movie. I would not personally call it my favorite movie. This might be because I read the book before the movie and, as always, the movie did not follow the movie all the way through. Even though there were a few differences it followed the book well enough that I could enjoy it. I loved the book so much that when I saw the movie I was disapointed. If not compared to the book the movie was very good. If you liked the movie you will love the book. Although animated, it is not for the easily scared or faint of heart. There is a fair amount of blood and violence etc. The animation was decent and the story was fast paced. If I could change the movie I would get rid of the part with the music in it (although if you read the book you would find a bit of symbolism in it but nothing completely necesary) and I'd change the introduction to something a bit more easily reconisable. Over all I thought the movie was enjoyable but not even half as good as the book.

1425796,5,B00005IBCP,"I was just reading through the other reviews, and one of them struck me. The reviewer was explaining how he/she used to watch this movie when he/she was a kid, and it scared him/her, but at the same time he/she loved it.

This is exactly how I felt when I was a young child.

This was one of those movies that I always used to rent at the video store. I loved it. It scared me very much, but it was, at the same time, amazing. I actually rented the movie so many times when I was little, that the video store ended up giving it to me...

Anyway.

If you are one of those parents who doesn't let your kid watch scary movies, I do not recommend this film. But, if you are able to convince your children (as my parents convinced me) that everything they are watching is ""pretend,"" then I definitely do recommend you purchase this movie. It is one of those films that has stuck with me since the time I was probably about 5 years old. I'll never forget it, and it will always be one of my favorite films.

As for comparing it to the book... Well my class read the book in 8th grade, and I volunteered to bring the movie in for the class to watch. There are some differences (of course), but if you're looking for an interesting movie, you've found it here.

1425797,2,B00005IBCP,"Many of the unfavorable reviews here condemn the movie because it is too violent and dark for children.  IF the book were a children's book, and if this movie were aimed at children, this would be a valid point.  Both the book and the movie, however, are clearly aimed at young-adult and older audiences.  Therefore, any review that says, ""This was bad because I showed it to my children and they were horrified"" misses the point altogether.

In addition, this movie is an English production from 1978.  The movie-making style is (a) European and (b) typical for the time period.  Modern American audiences who are uncomfortable with lyrical sequences and gentle, hand-drawn animation will find fault with this film for those reasons.  If, however, your taste in film is sophisitcated enough to not expect the latest computer-generated, pop-music-filled, thrill-a-minute Hollywood product, the style is not an issue.

That said, I can't recommend the movie enthusiastically.  Rarely do movies do complete justice to the books on which they are based, but usually one can appreciate the movie for what it did with the material and the difficult job of compression and abridgement that must take place.  In this case, however, the movie is a poor representation of the book, lifting only major plot points and leaving behind the rich allegory and societal issues that are the heart of the story.  Also left behind are the humor and the matter-of-fact explanations of Rabbit Society:  ""Rabbits can only count to four,"" etc.  The film sometimes uses the ""rabbit language"" terminology without explaining it, even by context.  Even though the movie merely omits, rather than changes, characters and incidents, so much is lost in the translation that it renders the end product a bit lifeless (despite the frequent conflict and danger) and even pointless.",1117929600,21,1848,5.116666666666666
1425798,4,B00005IBCP,"I saw this film when I was a child. I think I was maybe 5 or 6 at the time, and it frightened me terribly, but at the same time I was transfixed and couldn't turn away. I never saw it again until I bought the DVD yesterday, and I've watched it twice.

First I'd like to comment that this probably isn't the best movie for very young children. I would say they would need to be at least 10 to fully understand some of the concepts of the film. As a reviewer stated, and I agree, this is a wonderful movie to introduce the concept of death to a child. The film can be a wonderful learning tool to show that the world is not all sunshine and roses... However it also teaches you that if you believe strongly enough, and are willing to fight for it, you can find a place where the sunshine and roses are.

I won't give any plot details, since so many other reviewers did that. However I will say there are moments when I was watching this as a 30-year old adult that I was left speechless. Good examples are the loss of Violet, and when Fiver says ""Look! You can see the whole world!""

And if you don't well up when The Black Rabbit comes to Hazel at the end and asks him to join his Owsla, something is terribly wrong with you.

I'm very happy I reconnected with this part of my childhood. Seeing this now I can understand why it affected me the way it did as a child. But, at the same time I wouldn't say this isn't for children. Just know that this isn't like animated feature films of today. There is no sugar-coating to soften the blows of harsh reality. I wish they would make more animated films like this now.

I'm giving it a 4 because the DVD doesn't have much in the way of special features. The movie itself gets a 5.

If I could sum up one influence on my own writing and thought processes this film would probably be up there. I recalled the film after seeing it as a reference in ""Donnie Darko"".

For instance, in the movie, the viewer is often unaware of the rabbits motives.  This was a huge theme in the story not to mention the stange way they left Strawberry out and the horrific details of the second warren in the story also lost its impact.

Joyously, though, it also has wonderful performances and a screen play that does tremendous justice to Addams's affecting novel.  John Hurt, as Hazel, has a rare opportunity to play the purest of heros and Richard Briers is plaintive as the psychic Fiver.  Every performance Denholm Elliot ever gave was a treat, and his stint here, as Cowslip, is no exception.  And Zero Mostel as Kehaar--absolutely hysterically funny!

If you've never read the book, this film is about defining civilization, pursuing freedom and happiness (without doing harm to others); and ultimately about friendship, loyalty, and the true nature of leadership and heroism.

1425802,5,B00005IBCP,"I first watched the movie on TV way back in May 1979 when I was 9 years old. I fell in love with it. Even after all this time, it is still the very best animated movie I've ever seen (and I've seen alot of them since!) and one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. I love it because it does not go the ""Disney"" path, as mots modern animated movies go now. One thing I love it is that there's only got one song in it, and unlike Disney movies, the characters don't burst into song every 5 minutes, so making it a marvellous ride from start to finish. When the one song does appear, it appears at the right time and is used in the right scene for the abosutely maximum effect. And animators are not afraid to make animated movies darker and more violent as well, so telling a richer and more relastic view of the world around us. I wish more animated movies did this.

And one last thing, ""Bright Eyes"" by Art Garfunkel is one of my all time favorite songs. It is just so sappy and dark. Particually in the spot where it's used. It was only in 2004 that I found a song more sappy and dark than this. And that song came only by pure luck!

It's a pity that not many young people today see this stuff now. If they did they might get to see that there's a whole world of animated movies beyond the usual dumb-downed Disney stuff.",1102982400,3,1333,4.064638783269962

1425804,5,B00005IBCP,"WATERSHIP DOWN is a timeless tale about the battle between good and evil and, in animated parable, speaks eloquently to questions about peace and freedom.  A classic and faithful adaptation of Richard Adams' beloved book,

The animated production also features the vocal talents of some of Hollywood's biggest names. John Hurt (THE ELEPHANT MAN and A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS) stars as Hazel, the free-thinking leader of a group of rabbits that want nothing more than freedom. Sir Ralph Richardson (DR. ZHIVAGO and DRAGON SLAYER) cameos as the Chief Rabbit who is indifferent to the danger facing his colony of rabbits.  Denholm Elliott (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) stars as the, indifferent, dangerous domesticated rabbit Cowslip.  And the late, great Zero Mostel (the sensational and original Tevye from Broadway's FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) stars as the seagull Kehaar who becomes an ally of the fledgling colony of rabbits on Watership Down.

WATERSHIP DOWN is an animated classic that goes way beyond the usual animated fare and is a no-nonsense story that will become a family favorite.

1425805,4,B00005IBCP,"This is one of those movies which can stand the test of time, almost 30 years after it was released.

For those of us who saw this movie when it was still considered new, in the late 70's and even into the early 80's, this may bring you some feelings of nostalgia, as you ponder over the possible messages of this movie, and how things have changed since those possibly carefree days.

By today's modern animation standards, the hand-drawn animation in this movie might be considered crude or rough. The style of animation seems to be deliberate, and even seems to bring a little more life to the story.

I'd also say that in today's 'touchy-feely' society, this movie might not be considered appropriate for children under the ages of 10.

If I have a single complaint about this DVD, it's with the sound production. The audio track is extremely poor quality. I had to max the volume, and even ended up turning on sub-titles.",1093910400,9,926,4.593939393939394

(There, now you can skip the book.)

Next, I would honestly put this movie on a list of the best along with Casablanca, Forrest Gump and other greats.

Finally, having had one house rabbit before and another one now, I may be biased. However, I think the story works even better in this case with the rabbit point of view than a similar story would from a human pov.",1092700800,4,688,4.317829457364341
1425807,5,B00005IBCP,"I am delighted with the September 2003 release on DVD of the beloved animated feature film Watership Down as a 25th Anniversary special edition. Owning a copy of this movie, which is to me uniquely special, indicated the central role DVD technology has assumed in preserving people's favourite movies for home viewing in a more lasting form than ever before. Only now have I begun to collect movies after many years of avoiding them owing to a concern over the utility, and durability of the decay-prone videotape system. This film, one of the very first I have purchased, has some extras added, the most useful of which is an extensive commentary from director Martin Rosen that covers most aspects of the film's generation and adaptation from Richard Adams's award-winning book. But the film itself is a true classic. I saw it at the cinema in early 1979 aged nine, soon after reading the book (which was a 9th birthday present for me).It made a very strong impression on me, and I found it a beautifully-realised tale that incorporated a mythic prologue that explained the basic workings of rabbit society, a dangerous quest, a very well-defined central cast of rabbit characters- the noble Hazel, the courageous Bigwig, the prophetic Fiver, and the oppressive General Woundwort. There is fear and danger in the rabbits' adventure but also heroism, ingenuity and loyalty, not to mention altruism when the kindly if cantankerous seabird Kehaar (voiced by Zero Mostel) is given shelter by the rabbits and later acts as a scout, helping them hatch a plan to stave off invasion by a ruthless tribe of neighbouring rabbits they come into conflict with. The English countryside is delightfully, and accurately portrayed, and the idea of animated animals enacting a tale that has at its heart the battle to survive in the face of human expansion and ecological destruction works well. The film cannot, in 88 minutes, give too much detail of the several alternative styles of societal organisation (described more fully in the book)that the rabbits encounter on their journey, but nothing crucial to the story is omitted. The other wonderful feature of Watership Down is the original song Bright Eyes, performed by Art Garfunkel. This hauntingly beautiful tune appears in an edited dream sequence in the middle of the film that represents Hazel's rescue after being dangerously hurt. It is my all-time favourite song.
This movie is most suited to older children (8-9+)and adults, and will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.",1082937600,11,2531,5.042959427207637

1425809,4,B00005IBCP,"I saw this film for the first time after a friend who had seen it in the theater in 1978 recommended it.  I was prepared to watch a children's movie and was struck by the seriousness of the subject and the realistic scenes.
The film begins with the mythology of the rabbit which is rather odd but in a cute way.  This introduction foreshadows the hardships and enemies the rabbit species will face.  From there the story seems to touch on at least two issues: fascism/Marxism and environmentalism. The latter is only briefly touched on.  The small rabbit Fiver, who has unexplained powers to foresee the future, urges a group of fellow rabbits in his ""warren"" to leave before their land is destroyed by some destructive force.  Actually, it is man who tears up their fields, but it is only described briefly by a survivor.  In their journey to the safe mountain top (utopia?), they encounter several enemies and a funny bird friend (my favorite of the characters).  Once they reach their destination, they realize that they have no females in their group (the only ""doe"" having been killed) and must return to dangerous territory to acquire mates.  Their worst enemy, ironically, is a member of their own species; a fascist rabbit who threatens to have any dissenter from his warren killed.  Also, ironically, inventions of man (i.e. a boat) are used by the rabbits in their struggle to survive. A musical segment with music sung by Art Garfunkel interrupts the fairly fast-moving story.
The violence in this film is surprisingly realistic and graphic. Some rabbits do not make it, so very young children may need to be prepared before watching.  I also looked at a VHS copy of this film, and DVD is far superior in terms of graphics and color.  The extras on this DVD were a little disappointing considering that this film is a classic (i.e. a glossary of rabbit words that is not even complete).

1425811,4,B00005IBCP,"Just to clarify matters for a couple of confused previous reviewers:-
1. 'Animal Farm' is NOT an animal book (I can't believe I'm having to explain this...); it's a book about socialism and fascism. 'Watership Down' is a book about rabbits. True, there are some references to the evils of fascism, but if you want to pick out a message, it's obviously the spoilation of the planet and the destruction of its wildlife by humankind. Yes, there are mystical overtones, but it's definitely NOT about religion.
2. I seriously hope the person who wrote 'if you want good drama watch a soap opera' was being ironic, but I have my doubts...
In short: this film is a pretty good effort at adapting an extremely difficult novel. Much has been lost, of course, but few of us would pay to see a three-hour animated film about rabbits. Martin Rosen and his team follow Richard Adams's lead in not shying away from showing us the violent side of the rabbits' lives. Children are likely to enjoy the film, but bear in mind it contains unpleasant moments. However, I think these are more likely to encourage sympathy, compassion and respect for the natural world than do any harm ( although many children and quite a few adults may shed tears before the end). Please make sure you read the book, too - it's superb. And look out for the animated version of Adams's 'The Plague Dogs'... although that really IS dark and distressing. I'm a big fan of Disney's work, but I'm still glad they didn't produce this adaptation ( as was originally intended) because I'm sure they would have softened the story's harsher elements. The animation isn't spectacular but it serves it's purpose, and the rabbits themselves are well done.

In fact, childhood is probably the best time to see this movie-- its flaws will not be so apparent and its poetry and brutality will be at their most effective.  It's exactly the sort of movie you love when you're seven, hope for years you'll get to see again, and rediscover in your late twenties with a mix of disappointment and elation.  The film, eccentrically animated and rather well voiced, suffers from a lack of exposition and the nagging sense that something important has been left out of nearly every scene-- and I can't be alone in finding Zero Mostel's Kehaar obnoxious and overdone (kids will probably find him funny, and do imitations of him while jumping off the living-room couch)-- but the story is exciting and full of shadow, the violence is neither whitewashed nor excessive, and where Disney, for example, would have yielded to the temptation to tack on a happy ending, Watership Down takes its heroes seriously enough to allow them the consequences of mortality.

The best advice I can give here is to read the book first.  Get all the minute details and definitions down, then watch this movie as a rehash of what took place.  This was one of my favorite movies as a child, but looking at it as an adult it looks too intense and violent for children. There are bloody sequences that still give me chills.

As for children, the movie can be shown for any age group, but some children may not the some of the undertones, such as the fascist rabbit warren.  You may also be explaining several things, such as death and war, to your children.  Incidentally, though, this IS an excellent film to introduce your children to the concept of death.

As for the flaws, the main ones are that it doesn't in-depth some issues.  Obviously, it is animated, and the book is over 500 pages, so it can't be too detailed, but there are some things that should have been covered better.  Cowslip's warren, for example, which has made a very sick pact with man, is barely touched on, but it is one of the most disturbing and best parts of the book.  Also, the animation is rather odd.  The film tends to be in dark lighting in general, and some of the scenes appear to have been drawn by amateurs.

The extras include a feature called 'Cast & Crew,' which should lead to miniature biographies and photographs of the talent involved, but only leads to a credits list, exactly as you find if you forward to the end credits of the film!
Also misguided is a glossary called 'Bunny Talk,' which purports to translate the Lapine words the rabbits use in the film (a great idea: if you want to 'look up' an unfamiliar word, you can simply activate this feature just as though you were looking in the glossary at the end of Adams's novel).  However, some of the Lapine used in the film does not appear in this abbreviated glossary, and some words that do _not_ appear in the screenplay are included in the glossary!  Surely it cannot have been too difficult simply to review the script, highlight the Lapine words, and compile the glossary out of these?
Also for those using subtitles: for some reason 'Chervil,' the name of an officer in the Owslafa, is transliterated 'Sherbil.'  I have no idea what a sherbil is, or why the captionist transcribed it so.  From the ear?  How hard would it have been for this captionist to _read_ the novel, to make sure he got things right?
My review expresses my frustration that this film couldn't have been better served in its DVD format.  _Watership Down_ really is a classy production as a film and deserves better.  My notes are simply for sticklers who love the novel and the film and think, 'What the heck is a sherbil?'",1057190400,5,1579,4.597864768683274
1425830,1,B00005IBCP,"""Watership down"" could've been a great cartoon..sadly,it was completely ruined by an overkill of drama. I was VERY disappointed in ""Watership Down""...the constant drama ruined the fun for me,and I finally stopped watching it,unable to stay focused and completely bored by it. No action,no comedy,no suspense,no adventure,no romance...just drama. That's it. Also,this is NOT for children.
Advice:If you want a GOOD drama,tape soap operas off your TV.",1056326400,2,449,5.7164179104477615
1425831,4,B00005IBCP,"We need more animated films like this today. I remember seeing this on TV during my pre-teen years, I think, and was quite impressed with its realism, symbolism and message. I remember being amazed that a ""cartoon"" could convey so much social relevence. Keep in mind that I was raised in the Roadrunner/Woody Woodpecker era, which offered nothing but mindless comic violence and guffaws, which are good, but ... I would recommend parents, especially parents these days, to watch this show with their children and talk about it afterward. It's very good.",1048204800,2,553,5.021739130434782
1425832,4,B00005IBCP,"Just a little note:
GERRY BECKLEY & the group AMERICA wrote a song for this movie, titled Watership Down.  It was never used in the movie.  AMERICA released the song on an LP titled HIDEAWAY.  It is truly the best & does an outstanding job in conveying the emotions of the movie.  It is worth a listen & you will not understand why it was not used in the movie. GERRY BECKLEY wrote it, George Martin produced it, AMERICA & GERRY BECKLEY performed it.  The best !!!",1047686400,2,464,4.287356321839081
1425833,5,B00005IBCP,"I saw this movie when it came out (1978). At the time, I was 7 years old. It made a definite impression on me - which is the reason I am looking to buy it now. No, most people would not consider it a movie for children, but I would rather my 9 year old son watch this than many of those silly Japanese cartoons that are so popular now. This is a remarkably well done adaptation of an incredible story, and considering the technology available at the time, very well done. While the animation itself is not the best, it really doesn't have to be to involve you in the story and pull you into the lives of its characters. Highly recommended - and afterward, you MUST read the book, if you haven't already.",1042070400,,703,4.214814814814815

1425835,4,B00005IBCP,"I have been reading reviews on this movie and I am really disappointed.  Most people have given this movie poor rating only because they have allowed their children to watch the movie and it scared them.  Does this automatically mean the movie is bad?  By no means is this movie better than the book, but most of the times books are made into movies I expect them to have a life of their own.  This movie succeeds in having it's own life it is able to stand up without the support of the book.  What I think is when a book is made into a movie the movie has to be different for us to enjoy it.  Last of all if you do have young kids don't let them watch it and if you do don't blame the movie for violence and gore.  Don't try and judge an adult movie under child appropriateness.",1039737600,3,780,4.0588235294117645
1425836,5,B00005IBCP,"I first read Richard Adam's novel when I was 10 years old, and found it hugely engrossing. A serious devourer of books, this was the first that I re-read once I had finished it.
I went to see the movie as a birthday treat when I was 12, and was more than a little disappointed at the omissions - although, to be fair, most of them were not mainstays of the plot, but Blackberry's wonderful tales of El-Ahrairah.
On the whole, the film stays true to the novel, and has some truly inspired interpretations (Fiver's vision).
As has been said many times, Disney this ain't.
Read the book before watching, and you may share my slight disappointment. Read the book afterwards, and you may find you re-read it too - especially if, like me, you are familiar with the Berkshire countryside.
It must be emphasised that my disappointment is slight - this is a truly great animation suitable for all ages, but not for those of frail dispositions or those easily upset by real life. There is a world of difference between an animated movie and a kid's cartoon, although personally, I think that this movie bridges the gap very well.
For comparison, read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, then go see the movie.",1037232000,5,1204,4.578703703703703
1425837,5,B00005IBCP,"This excellent portrayal of Richard Adams Best-Selling Novel is great, although most children under ten would not like it because of its graphicness. Any person who has read and enjoyed this book will love this movie, there are many powerful scenes including the one where Fiver goes to find his brother Hazel. When Art Garfunkel sings ""Bright Eyes"" and you almost want to cry. With excellent voice-acting from John Hurt and Richard Briars this is one movie that will always be on my Top Ten List. Go see it.",1033948800,3,508,4.719101123595506
1425838,4,B00005IBCP,"With the qualification that it is in no way a substitute for the classic novel, this is a good animated adaptation of ""Watership Down"".
As with the novel, Peter Rabbit this is not.  It is a brutally realistic look at how rabbits live with the threats of their thousand predators, other warrens, and above all man.
From top to bottom, the vocal casting is wonderful.  John Hurt is a commanding, heroic Hazel - but it's Richard Briers' Fiver who really runs away with the movie.  Perfectly registering bemused apprehension, quiet despair, utter fear and sometimes even helpless rage, he absolutely steals - and breaks - your heart.
The animation itself is more mixed.  The three different styles - one for the main story, one for the rabbit legends in the prologue, and a third for Fiver's visions - don't always connect smoothly and are sometimes of varying quality.  But, generally speaking, the English countryside background is beautiful, the violence suitably horrific (especially the confirmation by a survivor of the holocaust that Fiver predicted) and the animation of the rabbits admirably unique and individual.
The story remains quite faithful - often taking from the novel verbatim.  The scene that has the most impact is probably the one based on the chapter ""Fiver Beyond"", with Art Garfunkel singing Fiver's thoughts as he searches for a seriously wounded Hazel after everyone else has given his brother up for dead.  I hesitate to discuss omissions for fear of giving things away to people who haven't read the book, so suffice it to say that almost all the important plots and scenes are intact.  Any problems stem more than anything else from the fact that this work really deserved to be a miniseries doubled in length.
Definitely worth it, although again a complement to - not a substitute for - the book and not for nightmare-prone children.",1029456000,22,1860,4.939102564102564
1425839,1,B00005IBCP,"I took my seven-year-old daughter to see this. Within five minutes of the beginning of the film, I could feel her fear. We left. This is the only movie I ever walked out of.",1029110400,10,173,4.117647058823529
1425840,5,B00005IBCP,"Long before ""The Little Mermaid"" and progeny, there was ""Watership Down.""  To give you an idea of how old ""Watership Down"" is, there is Art Garfunkel singing on the soundtrack.  I first saw this movie when I was a child and was immediately drawn into the folkways and political philosophies of Richard Adam's rabbits as well as the environment they inhabited.  Watching the film nowadays, I find myself just as powerfully affected.
Perhaps my giving the award of best animated film to ""Watership Down"" is part of my backlash against Disney.  Well then, so be it.  Because I am simply tired of the same formula in just about every Disney film since Little Mermaid of a focus upon fast animation and witty dialogue.  What happened to a good old-fashioned story such as ""Watership Down?""  Given the time period in which it came out, it is not nearly as flashy or as technologically advanced as the latest Disney feature.  But for some reason, I actually find it soothing and therapeutic to see what looks like stuffed animals moving in front of an oil painting.",1026777600,2,1058,4.743169398907104
1425841,5,B00005IBCP,this is truly a masterpiece in the world of animation movies. It's a great storie and the animation is fantastic. poeple think this is a movie for kids because of the rabits but the characters are clearly based on human beings. and another thing this isn't anything like a disney movie. this movie doesn't have a superhero. I would also like to mention the great soundtrack. definetely a musthave movie.,1024790400,,403,4.771428571428571
1425842,3,B00005IBCP,"Watership Down is one of the most magical books ever written - it is difficult to describe the depth and wonder and amazing believability of the world Richard Adams has created.  It seems the perfect book for a movie, and while this movie is a worthy effort, it does not come close to the book in any way.
I watched this movie first as an 8-year-old child and adored it, then watched it again recently.  The feeling I got was that they had taken the contents of the book and dumped them into a basin of water, letting everything of substance sink to the bottom while skimming off the top what remained.  If that sounds harsh, I don't mean it to - it is simply that you can't capture that much depth in a short, animated feature.
I hope that this movie (as it did in my case) whets the appetite and causes the viewer to read the book - whereupon the movie will be forgotten and the real magic discovered.
I give it three stars for being the avenue by which I discovered the book, and for staying true to the story.  Although greatly abbreviated, they did at least get it right with very few and very minor changes.",1019088000,2,1113,4.285714285714286
1425843,5,B00005IBCP,I remember watching this movie for the first time when it was shown on CBS.They broke it into two nights showings and kept running warning messages about graphic and realistic depictions of violence. That and the fact that its an animated movie about talking rabbits probably limited the audience considerably. But for those who stuck with it a wonderful and very moving story unfolded and rewarded their patience and attention. This is a story that you must pay attention to and listen carefully to what is being said and which rabbit is which. Also has a great soundtrack. Highly recommended for adults and kids 8 and up!,1017964800,,623,4.831775700934579

  Once they have reached thier new home, they realize they don't have does (female rabbits), and no does means no kittens!

7938250,1,B00005IBCP,"well. what a movie. definitely not one for the kiddies. a bleak tale about some 'roguish' rabbits that set off to find a new warren before sub/urban development destroys theirs. a lot of trials and fighting with 'other' rabbits ensues. hazel and fiver are our guides through this attempt at a 'parable' for man's inhumanity in 'progress - much in the same vein as Orwells' Animal Farm was a look at 'human' politics.
woundwort is the 'leader' of a litter of rabbits and as all the other rabbits retreat and scatter from a hound that is decimating them, he tells them that ""dogs are not dangerous"" and henceforth 'attacks' the dog! the film freezes before we see what we KNOW is going to happen as the omnipotent narrator let's as know that ""we don't know what happened to woundwort"" (!!!) - but we DO.

the movie had a theme song appropriately sung by art garfunkle and the end of the movie is so utterly bizarre that it can only be summed up by the Queen line: Bismillah!",1493164800,,972,4.491525423728813
