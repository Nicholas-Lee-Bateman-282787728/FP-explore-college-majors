8435368,4,B004LZPY4W,"I purchased this combo set of Robert Young films for the sole purpose watching Miracles for Sale. This is a film that was an adaptation of a mystery book author whose works have not translated into films. He was of the great writers of the genre of the locked room mystery.... Clayton Rawson. Only two of his books were bought for the big screen. He was a professional magician whose protagonist was himself a magician who solved crimes that could not be explained. He never received the recognition of Christie or Sayles but his works were excellent. This film is only one of two that ever made it onto the screen. My curiosity got the better of me and I found it charming but very dated . This movie went for humor as well as a mystery. I was very satisfied that Mr Rawson was recognized by Hollywood as an author to take seriously for this genre. It is dated and a little too cute for a big budget production of fine ,unique mystery writer but does reflect his character as a master sleuth of unexplainable crime. Robert Young does his usual piece on screen but it works in this film. The other film is another low budget Robert young charmer if you are a fan. The author again is Clayton Rawson who other writers respected his talent and uniqueness. His books are far superior to what has been put on the screen but in this case worth a peak.",1489017600,,1346,4.388
8435369,5,B004LZPY4W,"Two wonderful movies from the lighthearted golden era of those great old B/W movies. Miracles for Sale is a well thought out whodunit. The movie has a great plot with humor, tricks, and a lot of action that never stops until the end when all is solved. The players that make this one the hit it is, Robert Young and the delightful Florence Rice, but one actor stood out as he did in every movie he made even though he was never the main player William Demarest. Here is a man that went from movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s to TV with My three Sons. He was the humor in this one. As for Paradise for Three you have a delightful movie of humor and with actors like the amazing Edna May Oliver and she is at her best in this one, then Florence Rice turns in a great performance as well and of course Robert Young does a great job. This is humor at its best. These are two movies you will watch more than once. They are that good. I suggest you get the set through Amazon. I tried someone else and got a damaged set. The Amazon set was perfect. The picture is very good as is the sound. Enjoy another set of the timeless moves of yesterday.",1454544000,2,1138,4.1076233183856505
8435370,3,B004LZPY4W,"Oh, Miracles for Sale! It is the film adaptation of one of the greatest books of magic and locked room ever written (Clayton Rawson's Death from a top hat); the story follows the outline of the book, needlessly changing the Great Merlini to Mike Morgan, replacing Jeff, the side kick, with father!
The women look sufficiently attractive, although Robert Young looks fantastic, but acting? Shoe string  budget, impoverished sets, and slap dash direction make the weak screenplay worse. The climactic catching the bullet with the teeth is surprisingly well done. I would have given it a worse rating but for nostalgia: 'those classic days of mystery writing!' Rawson, Queen, John Dickson Carr and Christie-their kind will never return. There is another feeble attempt to picturize Rawson's No Coffin for the Corpse, and this time Merlini is called Mike Shayne! What was wrong with the screenplay writers? Christie is the only one who has translated well, even brilliantly to the silver screen. Carr never made it to the movies and Queen's TV shows left much to be desired. So let's be happy that at least this movie is there to remind us of the golden age.
The print  on demand is good but the sound is well if not pretty bad but close to it.",1442275200,,1240,4.789719626168225
8435371,4,B004LZPY4W,"Usually I have hesitated to buy DVD-r products, especially the Warner Archives, because so many of them have skipped on my DVD player and have had to be returned.  However, both the DVDs in this set played without a problem; even fast forwarding and rewinding -- which often rattles the unstable DVD-r format and induces skipping -- didn't seem to damage the playing.

The two films here run at the full lengths listed on the IMDb, 78 and 71 minutes.  That totals 149 minutes, so the Amazon product information that has only 146 minutes is incorrect.

The supposedly unifying feature of this DVD set is actor Robert Young, who is the star or co-star in both pictures.  The other connections are in the cast (Florence Rice, Henry Hull and Walter Kingsford are in both films) and in the studio -- both were originally MGM pictures.

I bought the set for Miracles for Sale, being a fan of Tod Browning and of horror/mystery tales generally.  I figured that even if the other film was a dud, the price was right just for the Browning feature.  I was pleasantly surprised when I actually enjoyed Paradise for Three more than Miracles for Sale!  So I got more than my money's worth -- two films for not much more than the price of one.

Miracles for Sale is essentially a murder mystery with some spooky atmosphere; Paradise for Three (the title on the actual print of the film is ""Romance for Three"", which was the British title) is more like a comedy of manners, with a bit of the flavor of the later Preston Sturges comedies in that genre.

These two films, while not masterpieces of their period (1938-39), are workmanlike pieces.  Miracles for Sale has a definite ""B"" feel, but a clever (albeit creaky) plot, and compares approximately with a middle-quality Universal horror/suspense number.  On the other hand, Paradise for Three is a little better than a ""B"" film in quality, halfway between a B and a lead feature.  I found myself smiling all through Paradise for Three, as all the main characters, pretending to be people they are not, are forced into uncomfortable social situations in a Swiss ski resort; it's fun watching them all squirm in the results of their own deceit.  Robert Young and Florence Rice are perfect as the relatively bland ""straight"" characters, and Henry Hull, Frank Morgan, Edna Mae Oliver, Sig Rumann, Reginald Owen and Herman Bing are the kooky characters who play off against the straightness of the others.  Mary Astor, Frank Morgan (who is really a third lead), and Henry Hull are standouts here, but the others are good, too, with Oliver and Bing doing some good scene-stealing overacting at appropriate times.  Basically this is a light comedy with a fairly good story and a fine ensemble cast.  I'd never heard of it before, but I'm glad I have now.  No, it's not up there with the great screwball comedies, or Sturges or Capra films, but it's well-executed and funny.

Neither of the prints is really great.  These DVD-r products are budget products and you aren't going to see proper restorations on them.  There are sparkles and other flaws at various points in the films.  But the flaws are only minor distractions; basically the films are still quite watchable.  The sound is audible and clear; I didn't have to crank the volume up or down, as I sometimes have to do with older films.  And the films are uncut.

The only special feature is a trailer for Miracles for Sale.

If you collect either light romantic comedy or creepy murder mysteries, these are good second-tier films.  The set is worth 4 stars, considering the rarity and previous unavailability of these films.  To earn 5 stars Warner would have to do some restoration on the films and/or put in some extra features.",1423267200,,3719,4.7224806201550384
8435372,2,B004LZPY4W,"I searched out and purchased this movie because I read the book. I have the 1938 hardback copy with the original title of ""Death From a Top Hat"". On the front cover an ad had been placed urging you to go see the movie, released by MGM, under the title of ""Miracles For Sale"". I liked the book so much that I wanted to see the movie.  I was disappointed, I found the book to be much more interesting than the movie. I have not yet seen the other feature ""Paradise For Three"".",1401753600,,474,4.096774193548387
8435373,4,B004LZPY4W,"Paradise For Three is fantastic!  It has become one of my favorite films of that era!  It has a well-written comedy, with good acting that pulls it off!  However, if I were going to title it, I would have called it Paradise For Six!  Robert Young and all the cast were great!
The second film--which was a treat--was not my favorite subject, magic/illusion, but my parents liked it.  It had its moments, and it did offer up a mystery, to solve.
But, it's hard to beat this offer of two good films in the same packet!  Very entertaining!",1396569600,,535,4.408163265306122
8435374,4,B004LZPY4W,"I remember having watched PARADISE FOR THREE (1938) some years ago, and I vaguely remember having liked it - I dig stories about masquerading millionaires, romantic mix-ups, and the average bloke made good - but the draw for me, with this DVD set, is MIRACLES FOR SALE. It's MGM's nifty whodunit from 1939, peppered with screwball bits and tinged with the supernatural.

It adapts Clayton Rawson's mystery novel debut, DEATH FROM A TOP HAT (1938). Only, the screenplay switches up the name of Rawson's lead character from ""The Great Merlini"" to ""The Great Morgan"" (maybe because ""Merlini"" is a bit too obvious). Anyway, Michael Morgan (Robert Young) is a retired stage magician who gets by today by selling tricks to his former colleagues. Morgan's true passion revolves around exposing fake spiritualists. He reasons: ""Perhaps, someday, somebody may look into that dark room we call the Beyond. But these fake mediums are the greatest obstacle to progress in that direction.""

Mike Morgan puts on another hat, that of an amateur sleuth, when he crosses paths with the distraught Judy Barclay (Florence Rice) who is being stalked by a mystery man. Judy goes the typical route of the ""dame with a hidden agenda."" She desperately wants help from our guy, but she's not coming clean. A curious Morgan is soon steeped in corpses (splayed out on pentagrams) and no end in suspects. Can his penchant for imitation miracles see him through? Can he debunk this?

It's very debatable that this screwy cast of illusionists, demonologists, telepathists, and escape artists counts as the usual suspects. NYPD Inspector Gavigan (Cliff Clark) is out of his depth. Maybe you'd be, too, if your investigation lands you in dead bodies that vanish when you look away, inexplicable time disparities, and eerie typewriters that type out messages by themselves. ""What is this hocus pocus?"" remarks the bewildered Inspector Gavigan. Even the Great Morgan is stumped... but only for a bit. But how desperate are the straits that Morgan must resort to reenacting the late Sing Ling Fu's infamous magic bullet trick - one of the most dangerous tricks in magic - in order to finally nab the killer?

MIRACLES FOR SALE garnered good reviews when it first came out but still lost money at the box office, and so this became director Tod Browning's final film. Even seven years after the crazy controversial FREAKS, it didn't take much for the MGM suits to give him the shove-off. At least it's a good picture to go out on. It may not explore in depth all of Browning's favorite creepy elements, but there's enough of the macabre and the offbeat and unsettling that, from jump, it assumes that indelible Browning stamp.

This would be the sixth and also final go-around for Robert Young and Florence Rice as a romantic pair (both of whom also starred in PARADISE FOR THREE). Rice does her best with the thankless damsel-in-distress part. The reliable Robert Young, then 32-years-old, confidently carries off the lead role. He's got that light touch and that roguish gleam in the eyes. And to demonstrate that his character hadn't gotten rusty with the sleight-of-hand stuff, he pulls off a couple of now-you-see-it, now-you-don't tricks (probably assisted by a dash of movie magic). And, yes, the sugar bowl gag he pulls on the waiter is pretty amusing.

It's a fast-paced mystery, with Browning always finding ways to pique your interest, whether it's the peeks behind the curtain at the world of stage magicians or the various comic gags or those moments of grotesqueries. It's a solid supporting cast, too. One of my all-time favorite character actors, William Demarest, pops up as (what else?) an irascible cop. Lee Bowman steps in as one-half of a mentalist act. The Great Morgan is abetted by his no-nonsense 62-year-old widower dad (who despises all things New York City), nicely played by Frank Craven. And Henry Hull has a key role as Morgan's escape artist pal, Dave Duvallo, and demonstrates perhaps the earliest application of the contact lens. As someone who is very leery of contact lenses (I think touching one's eyeballs is super-icky), I salute Henry Hull as a figure of tremendous courage, what with his inserting those bad boys on his peepers back during the harrowing pioneering era of the contact lens. Maybe I've been laying it on too thick. See MIRACLES FOR SALE and, while you're at it, see PARADISE FOR THREE. Two entertaining movies.",1382832000,2,4430,4.955585464333782

8435376,5,B004LZPY4W,"My main interest in this double feature, was ""Miracles For Sale"" (1939) featuring my great uncle - actor Henry Hull, portraying two characters in this atmospheric and rather lighthearted film, which moves along at a nice pace. The story by Clayton Rawson, mixes comedy with suspense, and was the final film directed by Tod Browning. Henry Hull gives each of his characters a unique personality, Henry said he had great fun making it. Hull is best known for his starring role as the cursed ""Dr. Glendon"" in ""Werewolf Of London"" (1935) and as a supporting player with Vincent Price in ""Master Of The World"" (1961) as well as many others. The film also offers a rare performance of the mysterious Gloria Holden, remembered for her role as ""Dracula's Daughter (1936) - ""She gives you that weird feeling!"" as the publicity stated. Plus Robert Young starring as the master trick designer for several magicians, trying to unravel this cleaver locked-room murder mystery. The sets, props & costumes all have the high production values that MGM was famous for. The transfer quality is top notch, Warner Bros. thankfully has not neglected an intriguing little ""B"" picture as this, with such a wonderful cast. Have not seen the film in years, until now - it is a treat, highly recommended for fans of fantasy & mystery films. - Cortlandt Hull",1375660800,5,1331,4.86784140969163
