8490836,2,B000083C44,"I heard about this video while watching an old ""Dr. Phil"" episode. It recommended this as an excellent sleep tool for getting your kids relaxed & ready for bed. It worked the first two nights but it made no difference after that. I think he started to tune it out after watching it repetitively for a couple weeks. My son is entertained from watching the animals, though does not want to watch it regularly any longer.",1252972800,,418,4.5131578947368425
