3905003,1,B002C7ELY0,"I love Mariah Carey she is one of my favorite singers, but in this movie I was expecting them to give her a much uplifting part, instead it was kind of sad that she was in a bad relationship and helping some brothers get from one place to the next with confusion as to what was wrong with one of the sick brothers and her husband which is a cop is now looking for her.  It was a  boring and sad movie.  they did not really showcase Mariah singing ability which I was expecting, this should have been  just a cable movie, PERIOD.",1295568000,2,528,4.097087378640777
3905004,5,B002C7ELY0,"TENNESSEE is a minimalist film: there is very little dialogue, not a lot of movement, not a huge climax.  It just happens and while it is happening it changes you.  Though it is a small budget film it makes a big impact, making us wish that there were more films like this to counterbalance all the big over the top bonanzas that seem to rule the theater circuit.  It is gently written (by Russell Schaumburg), sensitive directed by Aaron Woodley, and acted with honesty by a fine young cast.

Ellis (Ethan Peck, definitely an actor on the rise) and Carter (Adam Rothenberg (ditto) are brothers; their mother is dead and their father has a history of abusing the boys to the point that Ellis and Carter no longer see him.  Ellis is a photographer by hobby, taking photographs of mountains and landscapes in their Tennessee small town: Carter drinks too much but looks after his younger brother.  Ellis is diagnosed as having leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant - Carter offers  but despite being siblings the match is not adequate.  The brothers set out on a trip to be together and end up in New Mexico. But soon they are on the road again and in Texas they pause at a diner where they meet Krystal (Mariah Carey) waiting tables, but preferring to write songs.  Seeing that the brothers have no money, Krystal takes them home - she is married to an alcoholic Texas Ranger Frank (Lance Reddick) who routinely beats her and demands that the 'freeloaders' be gone in the morning. The next morning the three of them take the car and head to Tennessee - the boys have decided that Ellis' only hope is to find their father to see if he is a candidate to donate bone marrow. The three are chased by Frank until they finally reach Tennessee where, for need of cash, Krystal sings in a nightclub contest and captures the audience's approval while she now has money to give to the brothers to find their father.

How these disparate, desperate people come together emotionally and the manner in which the story ends may seem too pat for some, but for viewers with vulnerable hearts this little film will be fulfilling. Each of the cast is excellent, but it is such a pleasure to see Mariah Carey in a role that merits her talent and find that she handles it so well  is rewarding.  It is a small story with a huge heart.  Grady Harp, December 10",1293494400,12,2344,4.513002364066194
3905005,1,B002C7ELY0,"Plot consists of an unrealistic string of failures and poverty. Such as, in order: Abusive husband to his wife and his son with stereotypic fight of son to save mother. Son and mother flee. Mother dies. Son is abusive, at times, to his brother who has cancer. Brother loses contact with his girlfriend. Both brothers go searching for missing dad in car that breaks down. They meet Mariah the waitress (of course) who is abused by her boss and her husband. Abused Mariah teams up with abused brothers and they end up being chased by Mariah's abusive husband who happens to be a cop. Abusive cop while in pursuit encounters abusive couple in bathroom scene. Father is found dead. Brother also dies. Ashes, of course, are spread on mountain.

Very poorly produced, edited, acted and written. Put together at the last moment with limited funds and last minute signee actors. So cheap the hospital scene looks like a motel room with a rented oxygen bottle for ambience. Movie has a staged, rehearsed feel to it such as the obligatory depression era jumping boxcars to get to Tennessee and the stilted and excruciating long scenes of poorly lit rooms, car journeys and scenic hills.

Mariah's role in movie is physical appeal, 3 minutes of singing and her vast movie acting education telling the directors how she should act.

Movie was suppose to be heartbreakin' honest in order to make the audience weep and see life as beautiful. Instead it was heartbreakin' contrived in all respects.",1266710400,2,1483,4.830708661417323

3905011,4,B002C7ELY0,"When my husband and I first decided to visit Gatlinburg we really didn't know what we were in for and a video of this fascinating town and it's surroundings would have been nice.  Since our first visit 5 years ago, we  now make the trip to Gatlinburg twice a year and even though this video was  released in 1995, it still rings true in 2000!  I would recommend this  video to anyone planning to visit this remarkable little town and it's many  attractions.",954720000,,457,4.445783132530121

3905034,4,B002C7ELY0,"Hesitant at first about purchasing a independent film I had little about although being a Lee Daniel's film and the price I ordered, and am truly glad I did.
The plot and story is not only original and believable it contains surprise a few surprises throughout the film that generally aren't expected in dramas. with a great main plot and characters whose own background and in depth story plots keep you interested and engaged.
Acting, Ethan Peck gives a moving and believable performance, Adam Rothenberg (whom i never heard of previously) delivers an on target portrayal of his troubled and overwhelmed character, and Mariah Carey who even after redeeming herself in Precious surprisingly shines thoughout the feature. On screen most the film she dose so well I forgot she was Mariah.

Truly a Gem and a find",1380585600,,811,4.91970802919708

3905040,4,B002C7ELY0,"i put off seeing this movie for a long time, i just didn't think it was going to be good. Also because i am cheap when it comes to buying movies. Lucky for me my mom has netflix. i saw it on there and the movie turned out to be really good. I was crying at the end. People dying always gets to be, then add on that the brothers backstory and it gets to you. To be honest the movie is slow getting started, and i would agree with another people who stated that the story picks up when Mariah enters the story. I would have given the movie 5 stars but i fell asleep in the beginning. I don't know if it was really boring or i could've been just plain tired. The second time though i watched it the whole way through and liked it. i wished they could've done some backstories on the dying brother (i forgot his name). i wanted to know see his past, besides his brother.",1308873600,2,866,4.011560693641618

8363541,4,B002C7ELY0,"The story was great, the acting was great, but there were a lot of unlikely scenarios and too many easy answers. For one, no one had a cell phone. This was 2004-6, something like that and all they used were pay phones. Where can you find pay phones these days? Then, an abusive, controlling husband chases his wife across the country (btw- he wouldn't have jurisdiction in any state but Texas, he's state patrol!) And then just has a change of heart and walks away - not likely. Mariah Carey knows right where the two guys are. Everyone has unlimited cash. A freight train is right there ready to go to Nashville, where Mariah Carey happens to have a friend, etc, etc, etc. The old girlfriend comes out of the school when Carter is there. It became almost laughable.

Still, it's good and worth watching if you can suspend your disbelief.",1499990400,,838,4.549668874172186
