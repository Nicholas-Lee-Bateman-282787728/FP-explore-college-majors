It looks like the second season will revolve around WWI just like the second season of ""Downton Abbey"" did. 2014 is the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI.I am looking forward to watching the rest of this coming season.",1394582400,26,265,4.782608695652174

6208851,3,B00HUAH1H8,"Aside from Jeremy Piven and his ptiful acting... I've continued to watch this series  IN SPITE of him being Mr Selfridge.

I've enjoyed the storylines that branch off from the various other characters in the series...and thankfully his character has mellowed out some in season 2 so I'm not as annoyed anytime he is in the scene.

I'm enjoying it enough to continue watching...but it's not something I would own or even pay money to watch.. thankfully it's part of my prime subscription",1503100800,,486,4.831325301204819

6208855,1,B00HUAH1H8,"Jeremy Pivens is terrible in this series. I watched Entourage faithfully, and truly he is an extension of the same all be it tamed version of Ari. I was disappointed in this series. I'll keep watching in order to see if it gets better.",1493596800,,235,4.363636363636363
6208856,4,B00HUAH1H8,"Bring back Oliver Jackson-Cohen!!! aka Roddy Temple. I love this show, but I would love for MRS. Selfridge to be adored and loved. Also I agree with some of the reviews, that sometimes I can't stand the way Jeremy Piven talks. He has this weird way of talking but it doesn't bother me enough to dislike the show. But seriously... can you bring back Roddy Temple? (I'm only in season 2 so i'm secretly hoping he's back in season 3)",1488844800,,430,4.3875

6208887,5,B00HUAH1H8,"We thoroughly enjoyed this period piece.  I am a big shopper and seeing the inner workings and the history of a real department store was fascinating.  I know it's fiction, but the characters were very real as was the depiction of the tension between different socioeconomic classes.",1486252800,,283,5.0

6208897,5,B00HUAH1H8,"I was dubious at first with regard to the show. I said to myself ""How interesting can it be to watch a story about a man from America creating a department store in the UK?""actually, this is a very interesting story. The character development and subplots cheap you watching. There's also a  bit of drama and intrigue.  Although it is a fiction story, you  clean a great deal about the world during that time.  A good portion of the storyline is based on women's rights and how they to come to the forefront during the early 1900s. The start of World War I was beginning to rock the world and how this impacts the characters is captivating.",1486166400,,640,4.444444444444445

6208902,5,B00HUAH1H8,Really enjoyed this series although I really loved Season 1 a little better. I started season 1 first of course and there was a bit of a slow start but by episode 3 I was hooked! Everything from Masterpeice and Britain is great TV. The cast is terrific and writing is really great. Jeremy Piven overacts a bit as Mr Selfridge but the rest are really good.,1486166400,,355,4.313432835820896

This is one of the best screenadption of History that I have seen...and the acting and storyline are addictive.  I don't know why, but the British are so much keener to get it right and the Masterpiece and BBC productions are just not equaled in the US or anywhere.  I googled the Selfridge story.  The series is a rewrite of the real thing!!!  I am as engrossed as I was with Upstairs/Downstairs",1485820800,,570,4.475728155339806

Script, music, sets, costumes, and most of the actors do well, but there's something about Piven's portrayal that falls flat for me;  not sure what is missing.

6209040,5,B00HUAH1H8,"A really wonderful series about a marketing pioneer at the turn of 20th century London. And it is a show about leadership -- how it's built, how it's maintained, and how -- when it is good -- it motivates, inspires and changes the lives of those who are exposed to it.  The series has heart - lots of it. I came to care deeply and feel real affection for every key character in this tale of, of all things, early 20th Century retailing. Imagine ""Are You Being Served"" as told with the sophistication of ""Downton Abbey."" There's much humor, pathos, heartaches, triumphs, highs, lows and, well, life here to keep you coming back for more. I should tell you that it takes about three episodes to get into the show's rhythm -- and to get past the suspicion that Jeremy Piven (Harry Selfridge) is over-acting. (I had actually stopped watching because his acting seemed so overcooked; but my sister told me -- as I tell you --  to stay with it...) I soon found myself becoming-- dare I say this? --  emotionally involved with these finely honed, deeply explored, utterly human characters  Lush, accurate, detailed, magnificent sets, historically accurate cars, planes and costumes really make this show a visual extravaganza. But it is the wonderful, deep, delightful, and intelligent characters that make this show really so enjoyable and even memorable. Don't miss this one. I found it to be sensational.",1483920000,,1400,4.820833333333334

I suppose the sacrifice of portraying an ardent capitalist in a somewhat positive fashion was choked down by the degenerate writers for the purpose selling their daytime tv infidelity; and after all they slander him as adulterer (something there is zero evidence for, he was faithful to his wife until her death) in the process, thus muddying the water enough sooth their pallet.",1481155200,,526,5.2

It is unpredictable which I love and my favorite kind of films are those where a group of characters work, relatively within one location and all drama ensues from there.  A brilliant series with brilliant performances.  Just sorry that some of my favorite characters have either died or left the series.  I thought that their stories could have gone on longer.",1479168000,,519,4.8522727272727275

6209223,5,B00HUAH1H8,"Excellent acting this season and excellent development of the story line and characters. It is great to see how the actors have jelled and can now fully play off of one another. Much more tension and embodiment of character, as well. I really enjoy seeing the story line develop the political aspect of being an American businessman in the United Kingdom, especially as world events develop to include both countries. I was shocked **SPOILER ALERT** that Harry and Rose would consider having them all together in England as the war progresses when it is clear that the city could eventually be bombed.

6209365,5,B00HUAH1H8,"Love this show. I don't watch TV on a regular basis as I don't have cable. However, once in a while someone recommends a show so I try it out. Often I don't get through the first season. I have now watched the entire 4 seasons and am craving more!!! Great characters, character development, interesting and sometimes devastating twists in the plot and one never knows what Mr. Selfridge will think of to enthrall us.

If you particularly like British shows, this is not typical. Though it obviously has that sway as it is based in London. The Selfridges are US expats and play very large and colorful roles in the show. They learn quickly how British society works, conforming some, but more often bringing change and innovation. Very refreshing, even if Mr. S is a bit of a cad at times. His life and his mores morph often over the course of the 4 seasons. One thing is clear, he loves his wife, despite his ""appetites"" and she gets stronger and more independent with each season. They're both delightful as is Lady Mae...can't get enough of her. She's wicked and kind and someone whom it takes a long time to get a handle on and then she changes.

Have fun!!",1476403200,4,1160,4.492890995260663

It took a nice spin on the end where he finds happiness, but I don't think that was the case in real life.  Very sad as he seemed to have a heart for the people that he employed and was a gift as an entrepreneur.  You will grow to love the characters and Mr. Selfridge.  I was sad to see it end.

6209544,5,B00HUAH1H8,"Excellent, excellent series!! Who knew PBS produced such quality TV? Yes, I am sure others will say, we did, but everyone has to make their own discoveries.

My Wife and I have been watching 1-2 episodes every evening. The last episode of Season 2 is already queued up to watch this evening and we will most likely roll right into Season 3 if time warrants.

We are probably enjoying it even more having finally upgraded from an old 25 year old projection TV to a new flat screen HD. The clarity of colors and just overall picture quality is so much better and to watch the period costumes in such vivid colors is an incredible jump forward for two oldsters who each have failing eyesight.

In conclusion, we feel it is one of the better series we have ever watched and are enjoying Season 2 tremendously.",1474156800,,805,4.5

Since Selfridge is finished, and so is Downton Abbey, I have to look forward to Poldark, which also is a great show. Pretty dark in some ways, and he spends a lot of time racing back and forth between places on his horse. That's okay. He's nice to look at, and so is the horse.",1473638400,,444,4.114942528735632

The story and characters get more interesting and more complex as the season proceeds.

It takes more than an hour to watch a 44 minute episode because of the ""video unavailable"" issues at Amazon. Amazon has many bugs in their program and it is irritating at best to have to start and stop so many times. I have complained about this issue before to no avail.

6209939,5,B00HUAH1H8,The thing I like the most is getting to see how the role of women has changed SOOOOO much and some of the things that influenced that.  This show very much chronicles the actual life of Mr. Selfridge.  I am now watching Season 3 and have enjoyed seeing the growth of not only the store but of the characters.

It's nice to see that good often overpowers the bad in life.

That is way out of step with the rest of his portrayed values, especially those of taking care of the store employees as family.  If they want to work on something, allow him to learn from his mistakes and get control of his emotions.  Always flying off the handle when provoked is always the downfall of people when others want to take them down, and there is always someone who wants to take you down.  Love the show.

6210353,5,B00HUAH1H8,"If there were 10 stars, that's what I'd give Season 2 of ""Mr. Selfridge"". It's progressed so much from Season 1 in terms of everything, especially the character development with all of its surprises. The sets and costumes cannot be denied their due. The fashion designer and hair/makeup professionals for this series are off the charts! I'm personally enchanted by the use of rich reds in Rose Selfridge's suits made richer with the accompanying warm browns of her hats. The same can be said of Delphine Day's wardrobe -- very rich and lush in its coloring and combinations of multiple textures. And the hair: how about the asymmetrical look created by the one-sided curled tendril?! Loving that. Copying that. Anyway, I have even grown fond of Jeremy Pivens' slightly theatrical performance of Mr. Selfridge, which was what I had trouble with in the first few episodes. (I think it underscores the impression/understanding of the REAL Mr. Selfridge: confident, self-promotional but all in a good way). My recommendation: watch this series, you will be hooked!",1464912000,,1060,5.097701149425287

6210405,5,B00HUAH1H8,Love the period pieces done so well by Masterpiece ! Performances are flawless. Characters are interesting and multidimensional. Scenery and costumes that just take you to that period in history and add so much to the feel of the production.  Too bad Downton Abbey got all the attention and detracted from this wonderful offering. It is definitely addicting! Great story telling!,1464566400,,379,5.213114754098361

6210408,4,B00HUAH1H8,I loved season 1 and 2 of Mr. Selfridge. The characters are funny and charming and it's fun to keep up with all the side stories that are going on simultaneously. I'm looking forward to seeing the next season and concluding all the stories. I recommend Mr. Selfridge for anyone who enjoys a touch of British history combined with light drama all centered around the Selfridge family and their struggle to become the best department store ever. It's easy to follow and quite entertaining.,1464566400,,487,4.809523809523809

6210412,3,B00HUAH1H8,"This was an extremely well produced period drama  with all the right sets and costumes.  However, I agree with many critics  I thought that Jeremy Piven  handsome as he is, was totally wrong in the series.  There wasn't enough contrast between his love for his family and his passion for his addiction  showgirls and gambling.  He seemed bland in the casino scenes; featureless when confronted with his debts in the boardroom.
Acceptance and acquiescence.  No excitement in his character; no depth of feeling to show real emotion when circumstances changed.  So it was difficult to feel sympathy when he fell from grace - since he himself didn't seem too upset.
In short, a very model of a wooden major magnate in the world of commerce.",1464566400,2,736,4.824

Jeremy could not have embodied Harry Selfridge better if he tried...
My only gripe is some details were not tied up as they did with every character on Downton Abbey...
Mr Grove's son real father was given time to see his son but you never saw him again after permission was granted.
Harry had THREE daughters but when his wife came back from Chicago, there were only two and the third one was never mentioned again.
Where was Rosalie's husband ? In Paris? He never came to visit his daughter?

The acting, the period set pieces, and costumes are quite remarkable.  I must say I wasn't sure Jeremy could take me there but he is Mr. Selfridge to me. His facial expressions are a main character themselves you can feel the weight and responsibility of leadership, ownership, family man and one who actualizes his/her own vision for self.

Many of the episodes dealt with the impact of the first world war on the people who worked for Selfridges.  It also dealt with issues like labor unions and women in the work place without  being too preachy or self-righteous.  I looked up Selfridges on the web and was surprised to learn that Selfridges is an actual department store in London.

BBC does a great job with all period dramas, but the overall scope and attention to detail is a notch above the usual.  It really looks like the early 1900s.

6210672,4,B00HUAH1H8,"I've become quite a fan of this series. The series revolves around that icon of British Department stores, Selfridges, with its headquarters still located in that magnificent Beaux-Arts building standing on Oxford Street, London. Ironically, although a British icon, it was founded by the American Harry Gordon Selfridge in 1909. The series is hardly high literature or sophisticated in its plots but there is a wonderful cast of characters as you get to know them. And I think that's the secret. The more you watch it, the more depth you see in the characters. There are a lot of them and they all give solid performances. The writer manages to keep you interested not by any fancy plots (they are simple and well-tried) but you really take a genuine interest in how the inhabitants of this rather narrow department-store world handle the familiar problems of life. There are of course a few of the villains that we love to hate and wait impatiently for their downfall or for someone to teach them a lesson, while we stand by happily ""booing"" at the right moments.",1462492800,,1065,4.793478260869565

8635865,5,B00HUAH1H8,"This Masterpiece Theater Mini-Series of Mr. Selfridge produced by ITV is a tour de force of excellent performances of the actors, the finesse of drama scripts, gorgeous costumes, and classically elegant settings coordinated as truthfully as possible. It chronicles Harry Gordon Selfridges business adventures from the onset of establishing Selfridges & Co in 1908 until his farewell to his labor of love twenty years afterwards.

From Episode I of Series 1 to Episode 10 of Series 4 (Final Season), we get to see a man named Harry Gordon Selfridge (1958-1947) who was something of a Napoleon Bonaparte knowing no word in his dictionary for Impossible. We see the man build a one-of-a-kind department store in Londons Oxford Street as an adventurous American tradesman against the British aristocratic chauvinism. Selfridge was a man who set a standard of modern department store; by placing the cosmetic/perfume counters on the lobby, Selfridge intended to sweeten the atmosphere of the floor in attempt to use it as a magnet for passers-by, especially women. In effect, Selfridge broke down the class-stratified fashion wall guarded by the rich/privileged by democratizing the luxurious items and making them accessible to common people as well.

Moreover, the ace portrayal of Selfridge would/could not be possible were it not for the fine acting of Jeremy Piven whose quintessential American accent doubled with inescapable American can-do attitudes triumphs over the transatlantic cultural differences in working with the British peers. The viewer will be left with a feeling of heartfulness of the characters upon finishing all of the episodes in this series and cannot help but applaud to Mr. Selfridge for his entrepreneurial effervescence and Mr. Piven for portraying the man in a stellar performance that evokes both pathos and respect.",1528329600,,1845,5.380622837370242
