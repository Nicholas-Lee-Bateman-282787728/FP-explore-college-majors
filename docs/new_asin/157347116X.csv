7798333,3,157347116X,"I saw this movie On Demand this past week and, while it isn't exactly the greatest film ever made, it's engaging enough because of the screen prescence of A. J. Cook (several years before the CBS crime drama
""Criminal Minds"") and a twist or two on a familiar plot. It's got its funny & tender moments. However, the ending was a little drawn out.
SPOILER AHEAD!!! They could've ended the movie with Dwn holding Michael in her arms as they kissed at the dance AFTER showing what happened to the evil Mercedes (that's just me, though). LOVED the song ""With You Tonight."" Great beat. A made-for-TV movie for the whole family. Rated PG for some scary moments.",1215907200,,654,4.598290598290598

If you are familiar with the  motion picture company ""Pulsepounders"" You will know that it is a  company that releases Sci-Fi movies that are mainly for Kid's to watch. I  am 13 so I am rather Family movies. On night my younger cousins were over,  and my  parents rented a film for my cousin,s to watch called Mysterious  Museum so we sat down and started watching th preview's. Teen Sorcerys  priview instantlly drew my attention. The next Day I sat down and watched  it and it was so good. Some think it it is like a modern Sleeping Beauty  but it is so so much more. it is a cross beetween Hocus Pocus and The  Faculty (Which were both great movie's)",965347200,7,694,4.3515625
