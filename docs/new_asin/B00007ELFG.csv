1807834,4,B00007ELFG,"In Tokeyo, Dr. Suzuki likes to conduct experiments on unsuspecting human beings.  Enter Larry Standford, American newspaper reporter.  Dr. Suzuki drugs Larry, injects him with his special ENZYME and POOF!  A MANSTER (Half man, half monster) slowly but surely emerges.  Murders ensue, of course along with a really FREAKY eye growing out of Larry's shoulder.  Soon a WHOLE BEASTLIKE head with scary fangs sprouts up!  The transformation sure gives a new meaning to the old romantic song, ""Put Your Head On My Shoulder""!  Great special effects for it's time and just a LOT of cheesy, scary fun!
The film is filmed in black and white/1960/72 minutes
Highly recommended for schlock lovers!

1807835,3,B00007ELFG,"I feel dirty giving the movie three stars or even writing about it for that matter. But this is a really bad yet entertaining film gem.

The Manster has a classic film-noir touch - filmed in black and white, dirty, dark, foggy, shadowy. There is a grim, confused, trenchcoat wearing, unshaven anti-hero. Combine these elements with a mad scientist, freaks, lurid horror imagery and some real nightmarish settings in Tokyo. Include a few cheap sets, gratuitous chases, and really bogus nonsense science.

 In addition there is lewd behavior, drunkenness, and lechery.  Sprinkled with some hokey acting, cliches and silly drama. Erupting volcanoes, geisha girls, chanting monks, Jack the Ripper style murders, Ape-Men, splitting bodies, splattering blood and the infamous eye in the shoulder... Don't forget to add a dash of Freud. All this in 72 minutes and somehow the picture still seems trite.

But for good or bad, The Manster is always remembered.

The Alpha video version is really not a bad quality DVD.  It has not been restored and there are a few scratches - but the film print is clear and the sound is not bad for a so-so print of an old C movie.

A note - The Manster's script is just begging to be reworked and the film remade - but even grimmer - with more psychology, bad behavior, sex, special effects and gore ...it could a perfect representation of the darkest side of man heading into the new millennium. \

 Its a wild screen as is and Id love to see  a take on it by Tim Burton, David Cronenberge, David Lynch or Terry Gilliam - what are you guys waiting for!",1062201600,4,1580,4.667870036101083

1807837,3,B00007ELFG,"While never quite as bad as an Alpha or Madacy DVD, Retromedia's titles usually seem to underwhelm for one reason or another (their Faceless Monster transfer is a disastrous must-to-avoid!!). In this case, it's not the movie's fault. The Manster, while hardly a great film, is a perennial sleaze/horror favorite, particularly, it seems, of anyone who was creeped-out by it as a kid on some late-night horror show. The wonderfully nauseating pre-credit sequence sets the tone, as a hairy monster attacks bathing geishas, splattering the rice paper divider with blood. In his mountaintop laboratory, the quite mad Dr. Suzuki keeps his hideously disfigured, slobbering wife Emiko in a cage, and is forced to shoot his ape-like mutant brother Kenji, an ""experiment that didn't work out."" These opening scenes establish a lurid, unwholesome atmosphere that blankets the entire movie like a sickening cloud. Happily married, responsible foreign correspondent Larry Stanford (Peter Dyneley) arrives to interview Dr. Suzuki, who inoculates him with an experimental serum. Larry immediately goes off the deep end: he stops shaving, starts drinking to excess, acting surly, neglecting his job, and lounging around in hot mineral baths with Dr. Suzuki, his secretary Tara, and a bevy of fetching geisha girls (a scene played for Dean Martin-ish double entendres). Larry starts feeling a strange pain in his shoulder, hair periodically grows on his hand, and his wife shows up to collect him, only to find him hot and heavy with Tara. There is an actually quite effective scene where Larry visits a temple filled with scary demon statues and kills a singing monk. Sliding further downhill, he starts hanging around in the street, randomly assaulting stray women, while back at the lab Dr. Suzuki traces Larry's metamorphosis on a line graph. Finally we get the infamous, unforgettable scene where Larry discovers an eye growing out of his shoulder, which quickly matures into a second head that looks like one of those carved coconuts you see in souvenir shops. The rapidly mutating ""manster"" arrives at the lab, kills Dr. Suzuki, grabs Tara, and heads toward the active volcano crater at the top of the mountain. I won't ruin the climax; suffice to say it was a real wow when we were monster-crazed adolescents, but packs a bit less punch today. The Manster is a bit serious, perhaps even dry, in tone for a C-movie of its type (some reviewers have suggested a fairly convincing psychosexual subtext), but moves along at a brisk pace, and offers some of the earliest instances of overtly twisted, ""gross-out"" imagery in a genre that was at the time still heavily dependent on goofy rubber monsters and wholesome heros and heroines. A proto-sleaze mini-classic, prefiguring the full-blown gore movies of just a couple of years later, but enjoyable on a camp level as well.
While this DVD definitely qualifies as ""good enough for now,"" it leaves me feeling like there's still a better version possible (there was an official United Artists laserdisc edition years ago). The good news is that the source print shows very little damage, only some light speckling/blemishing, and the tonal values, brightness, and contrast are generally very good to excellent. But many scenes look a bit washed-out and lacking in highlight detail, especially in comparison to my VHS copies (which are admittedly both rather dark), and the overall image suffers slightly from a grainy, dupey look. Essentially a decent transfer of a pretty clean 16mm TV print. Not terrible by any means, but not as crisp and detailed as we're getting used to (spoiled?) with DVD, and not what I'd consider a definitive, must-have release. Maybe I'm too picky; if you just want to re-live the Nightmare Theatre experience, this will probably do fine. The only extras are six chapter stops and a still ""gallery"" consisting of four B&W glossies and an ad mat. At least there's no annoying ""Drive-In Madness"" featurette. I haven't seen Alpha's DVD edition, but would assume it's worse. Haven't seen Sinister Cinema's DVD-R, either, but would assume it's at least this good or better. As they say, you get what you pay for. All in all, OK for the price, but not a definitive, never-need-to-upgrade edition.",1048291200,18,4252,5.0844062947067235

The bad doctor justifies his actions by claiming that he did it for science, although it's never made clear how creating monsters that kill people is a great boon for science.  But it does look as if the crazy doctor enjoys his work immensely (some gobbledygook about evolution and cosmic rays).  I love that he thought to put his secret lab on top of an active volcano.

My favorite scene is when the infected reporter looks at his shoulder and it looks back at him.

This is a bizarre romp through sci-fi/horror madness.

After watching both this 72 min. on-demand version from MGM, and the 73 min. on-demand version from Sinister Cinema, I can tell you that, if clarity of image is most important to you, go with the MGM; If seeing the complete film is important, the Sinister Cinema version will suffice. There is roughly one minute of closing dialogue that is cut from the clearer MGM print - for what reason, I have no idea. It's the usual corny 50's summing up dialogue about ""the good in men, etc.,"" but it works for this film. Admittedly, being a completist, I prefer the full film, even if it is not quite as sharp an image. If I were opting for a dvd version, personally, I'd go for the Sinister Cinema dvd-r at this time, until MGM decides to give back that minute of dialogue and releases it in their no-frills Limited Edition line or, perhaps, licences it out.

1807870,4,B00007ELFG,"Okay, let's be honest.  This isn't going to be your favorite movie--or even in the top 100.  (Heck, 1000!)  When you're in the right frame-of-mind, it delivers a fun (albeit silly) story in the classic horror/sci-fi motif.  Acting is passable, but not good.  Direction is passable, but not good.  Watch this for the experience, not as your Academy Award nominee.

Once upon a time there was a scientist.  As with almost all movie scientist before 1980, he bordered on ""mad scientist,"" and he rationalized experiments on humans as ""good for the many.""  (The poor scientist had a hard-luck story, too, but no spoilers.)  There was also the classic ""reporter-hero"" that was so common in these mystic times.  Yes, poor reporter is stabbed by mad scientist's syringe and slowly becomes...the Manster!

The story follows the reporter's degeneration into the Manster, a two-headed, murdering beast.  His editor and a very noble wife know there's a problem but no clue what, and they try diligently (and hopelessly?) to intercede.  The police are hot on the Manster's trail.  And the mad scientist is not quite willing to give up his experiment.  Will the Manster survive?  Can he become human again?  Can you now see him in the Tokyo Zoo?

1807879,4,B00007ELFG,"To appreciate this little-mentioned but memorable little horror gem from the late 50's you have to repeat to yourself that our current cybertech special effects crews were nonexistent back then. Directed by a Frenchman, filmed in Japan, only 72 minutes long and low-budgeted it, nonetheless, is one of my most remembered grade B horror films of the 50's. Actually, it was superior to a lot of the awful flicks of this genre being churned out here in the States and merits a grade B+ status among cultists. This one is a somber, creepy and atmospheric flick about an American reporter [Larry Stanford played by British actor Peter Dyneley] who sets out to interview a reclusive Japanese scientist. The doc, cordial but nuts, is experimenting with some sort of serum that's supposed to enhance the human condition. He uses the reporter as an unwitting guinea pig using dame and drink to inject the mojo into him. Minor problem: the Doc's last recipient of his invention, his wife, is a hideously deformed mutant. Larry should have interviewed her first. Anyway, after getting vaccinated, Lar turns into a tyrant---wife and pal unable to control him---then violent and then into a murderous nocturnal man-beast. Where's Claude Raines with that wolf's-head cane when you need him. There are two unforgettable scenes in this one: 1- an eye begins to appear on Lar's injection site [luckily he got stuck on his shoulder and not his butt] and as the movie goes along it becomes evident that a new mutant is beginning to grow from this site, head first! ; 2- at the finale, with the cops at his tail, an INCREDIBLE separation of the hideous mutation from the original human. For 1959 this was ASTOUNDING. Stark black and white filming with lots of shadows  and fog + bleak acting by all gave this one an eerie feeling throughout. This one was superior to a lot of the stuff coming out from Corman, Arkoff, Nicholson and American International Pictures [AIP] at the time. A definite overachiever.

1807880,3,B00007ELFG,"It's a unique take on mad scientist / mutant theme with a bit of Jekyll and Hyde. It is also set in Japan, which gives the film's otherwise familiar story another merit. The simple story involves one Japanese scientist Dr. Robert Suzuki (Tetsu Nakamura) performing an unauthorized ""experiment"" on the body of an American journalist Larry Stanford (Peter Dyneley) without the latter's knowing.

""Manster"" (1962) is a black-and-white film of which tone is different from those horrors produced by Universal or Hammer. As one of the reviewers on IMDb has pointed out, the film's touch is closer to those Japanese horror films made around this era, like ""The Human Vapor"" (1960) where the story gives more emphasis to the tragedy of each character than it does to the mutated bodies and the murders committed by the ""mansters."" Also, ""spooky"" sound effects are similar to those used in Japanese ghost movies of that day.

I am pretty impressed with some of the film's technical aspects. Even by the standard of the contemporary horror films, the effects are just acceptable, far from great, but it is easy to imagine ""the third eye"" scene had really scared the kids back in the early 60s.

Some English-speaking films, even today, describe Japan or other Asian countries in a ridiculous way, but they got Japanese things right (for the most part) in ""Manster."" The interior of the Japanese inn or bathhouse is authentic (perhaps they really shot there in Japan), and so are the town's streets or the policemen and squad cars. Some conversations are spoken in Japanese, which are almost perfectly done.

You cannot expect the same kind of fun as watching a campy Grade Z movie, which ""Manster"" is not. Still, this is an unexpectedly enjoyable film.",1219449600,,1743,4.918367346938775

1807882,3,B00007ELFG,"There are a few scary old movies I recall seeing when I was a kid back in the mid 70s, usually on a Saturday afternoon TV program called ""Science Fiction Theater.""  One had this doctor who gives some kind of injection into this guy's shoulder and later, when it's hurting like crazy, the guy pulls his shirt back and there's an eye growing in the skin!  It was enough to scare a 7 or 8 year old to death back then, and I never forgot it.

Recently I discovered the movie was called ""The Manster,"" and I found it cheaper on Amazon than renting it (if the rental stores actually had it, that is).  The basic storyline is the mad scientist Dr. Suzuki, experimenting with unsuspecting victims, in this case Larry Stanford, a foreign correspondent working in Japan.  I'm not sure what the doctor's goal was, but the reporter spends most of his time drunk and enjoying himself with geisha girls.  Soon he gets the eye on his shoulder and the urge to kill someone.  Eventually a full head pops out, followed by more killings, police chases and... the plot isn't hard to figure out.

But remember, this was a B movie - it probably wasn't that good when it was new in 1962.  It's in black & white and for the most part the special effects and acting are decent - the worst exception being the actress who plays the reporter's wife.  It was kind of fun to watch, especially with the kids who found it mildly frightening, or at least didn't laugh out loud.",1208736000,4,1445,4.398496240601504

1807885,4,B00007ELFG,"I remember watching this flick on TV back in the 60's, and it used to scare the daylights out of me. Especially the scene where he finds the eye embedded in his shoulder. And then, this flick, and many other movies like it, vanished from sight for almost 30 years.

Now, it's back in circulation, and I love it even more, because now, I find it truly HILARIOUS! When the main character, Larry Stanford, gets into his mood swings (caused by that serum that the Doctor injected into him), look out! He goes all-the-way off on everybody, including his boss, and his wife! This movie is worth watching just to see Larry verbally tear down everyone in sight, before he grows the extra head. Speaking of which, for a supposedly cheapie flick, the head-growing scene was superbly done. The sight of that extremely ugly head slowly sprouting up out of Larry's overcoat as he writhed in agony was well done. Now, the inevitable split scene, where the Manster is clutching onto a tree as his two heads slowly seperate into two beings, was also well done (especially when the two heads get far enough apart to actually look at each other....and scream). But c'mon! Larry's body should've been torn apart after that big ol' woolly beast ripped outta him. Nevertheless, this remains one of my all-time favorite horror classics, and I'm glad that it's back.",1142640000,3,1343,4.714893617021277
1807886,5,B00007ELFG,"This movie has some of the things that are required for any good movie:

story
casting
location

The main character is a straight talking, hard drinking newpaper reporter who is very down to earth.  That's what make it so shocking as he reacts to what happens.

He becomes the victim of a genetic experiment perpetrated by a mad scientist.  This causes him to develop what we might call a 'split personality'.  One side is his evil nature I guess and the other is his good side.

Don't think that things like this aren't possible as we continue to explore the mysteries of the genetic code.

The Atlanteans used genetic engineering to create 'things' that were only partly human to do all of their manual labor.

This brought the wrath of the gods down on Atlantis as it did to Dr. Suzuki.  The god Vulcan terminated all of his experiments.

1807887,3,B00007ELFG,"This cheesy and predictable monster movie from 1962 was a product of international cooperation between the US and Japan. The film is concerned with an evil Japanese scientist who (of course) lives adjacent to a volcano (what with Tokyo having such a high cost of living and all) who injects a reporter with a drug that changes him from a nice guy to a criminally insane two-headed monster. Obeying the movie dictum that all monsters are evil, he goes on a rampage and terrorizes the country.

In the end his wife from New York shows up, confronts him and spends the remainder of the film in hysterics. The climax of the movie is when the Manster takes care of the evil scientist, then splits in half in the most laughable transmogrification scene in history (it happens behind a tree). The reporter becomes normal, and the monkey-demon pushes the love-interest geisha into the volcano. After the reporter pushes the monkey-demon into the volcano, too, the police show up and moralize for a bit (this will remind some viewers of ""Bride of the Monster"") then explain how the Japanese legal system will have to sort the whole mess out.

There are many problems with the movie, but I do give it three stars for camp value, and for pioneering the path for other two-headed monster movies like my favorite ""The Thing With Two Heads"" (starring Rosey Grier and Ray Milland). I think it's worth pointing out that the great B-movie critics Harry and Michael Medved had a brilliant insight in their book ""Golden Turkey Awards"" that ""according to the credits, [The Manster] was directed by George P. Breakston and Kenneth G. Crane, but it is not known if this team represented the industry's first two-headed director."" Given the schizophrenic cutting between people walking and cars driving in gloriously boring stretches of stock footage and hyperactive overacting and maniacal killing, I think they could be on to something.

The special effects in ""The Manster"" are awful, even by the standards of the early 1960s, the storyline is stilted and plodding, but it is a good monster movie to watch from a historical perspective if nothing else. I noted that Amazon lists the plot keywords as ""Experiment, Monster, Third Eye, Two Headed Monster, [and] Volcano"". That pretty much sums it up, and any movie with those plot keywords can't be all bad.",1134864000,2,2334,4.85929648241206
1807888,3,B00007ELFG,"Written, directed and produced by George P. Breakston, who's probably more known for his role as Beezy in the Andy Hardy movies throughout the 30's and early 40's, The Manster (1962) aka Kyofu, aka Nightmare, aka The Split, aka The Two-Headed Monster, has the distinction, as far as I know, of being the first film to deal with the issues associated with a man having two heads, appearing some ten years before the better known and definitely more schlocky vehicle starring Ray Milland and Rosie Grier, The Thing with Two Heads (1972).
Starring the runner up in the Lon Chaney Jr. look-a-like contest Peter Dyneley, whose other notable roles include the voice of Jeff Tracy in the Supermarionation Thunderbirds series from the 60's, also appearing in such films as Chato's Land (1972) and K is for Killing (1974), as foreign news correspondent Larry Stanford.  Also appearing is Jane Hylton, whom I recognize from Circus of Horrors (1960) as Linda Stanford, Peter's somewhat wooden and estranged wife, Tetsu Nakamura as Dr. Robert Suzuki, and, in her first and only role, the comely Terri Zimmern as the doctor's assistant, Tara.
The film plays out in Japan, and starts off by showing some women bathing and such, oh yeah, and then being attacked by a mysterious, extremely hairy man-creature, oh no.  Now, we don't actually get to see the attack, but given the blood-curdling nature of the screaming, we can assume things didn't end well for these ladies.  Segue way to what appears to be a hunting shack on a mountain where Dr. Suzuki and his assistant Tara are discussing an experiment that escaped the previous night and has now returned.  The good doctor acknowledges that his man-thing is too dangerous, and proceeds to the cavernous basement of the shack (it's built on a mountain, so I guess he's utilizing the caves for his laboratory) and shoots the man-beast and dumps the body into a convenient lava pit.  Now here comes foreign news correspondent Larry Stanford, trekking up the mountain to the shack.  Apparently his boss arranged a meeting with the doctor, fishing for a juicy story of sorts.  The doctor informs Larry that he's working on theories of evolution, and takes a keen interest in the reporter, as he decides that Larry has just the right characteristics for his experiments (if that includes smoking like a chimney and drinking himself silly, yes, doctor, he's your man).  Anyway, the doctor slips Larry the proverbial mickey, and then injects him with something.  Larry awakens with a doozy of a headache, and leaves, but not before agreeing to meet up with the doctor again in Tokyo.
Next we cut to Larry at his newspaper, and we learn that his days of traveling the world, reporting on various events are coming to an end as he's soon leaving to return to New York to settle down with his wife, Linda.  Peter gets a call from the doctor, and they hang out in a Geisha house, where Larry gets schnockered good on saki and has a grand old time.  Larry has so much fun he puts off his returning home to New York to hang out with Dr. Suzuki and pitches a little woo with the doctor's assistant, Tara.  Larry also begins suffering from pains in his shoulder and arm, and we know this has something to do with the secret enzyme shot the doctor administered not too long ago.  Soon Larry's wife shows up from New York, worried about his not coming back when he was supposed to, and she finds that Larry is not quite himself.  Larry tells her they're through, and that he's going to stay in Japan with the much more attractive Tara (who is beginning to feel a bit guilty about her involvement in Dr. Suzuki's part of the experiment on Larry).
Soon Larry's hand and arm changes, getting all hairy and claw-like, and his shoulder begins to hurt more and more.  What's with this pain in the shoulder?  How about the fact that he has an eyeball growing out of there?  Wouldn't that be something worth getting checked out?  Maybe it's not covered in the HMO...anyway, we learn from the doctor that Larry is evolving into a species never before seen on Earth...this should be fun...given what I've seen, I think devolving would be the more correct term.  Larry begins to flip out, sprouting a second head, and murdering a few Japanese locals along the way, while the police become involved as they start hunting this homicidal manic haunting the streets of Tokyo.  Things eventually come to a...ahem, head (pun intended) as the chase for Larry and his permanent buddy increases.  What happens next?  Let's just say Larry and his new buddy come to a `parting of ways'...
I rather enjoyed this movie, despite a few shortcomings...the most noticeable being given the dangerous and secret nature of Dr. Suzuki's experiments, I am unsure why he let Larry run around Tokyo during his transformation...I would have probably kept him locked up, but then, what do I know?  And there's a pretty clunky sub-plot about Dr. Suzuki, displaying classic mad scientist symptoms with his cold and calculating methods, later feeling remorse and regret about his deeds, based on nothing more than the continual harping from his assistant Tara...but whatever, this movie was still a lot of fun.  With its 72 minute run time, the pacing was pretty quick, and the makeup wasn't too bad.  I didn't get to see as much of it as I would have liked, but since this was a lower budget production, it was probably best not to highlight it too much, as it may have displayed inherent flaws.
Retromedia Entertainment presents a passable print, with some noticeable deterioration, but given the price of the DVD, I wasn't expecting a whole lot in this area.  There is also a special feature included in the form of a rather meager photo gallery (three or four photos).

7975496,4,B00007ELFG,"BOTTOM LINE: If you look in the dictionary under the term ""schlock"" you might find a still from this movie next to the definition. This is what drive-in cinema was all about. Silly, mindless and fun. Hard to resist a film that's this innocently goofy. Nice transfer, too. (Sadly, there are no extras.) 4 STARS

THE STORY: All-American ace reporter stationed in Japan is getting ready to return home to the States & his wife, but he has just one more story to do... and then his world spirals into an unreal nightmare as things go from bad to worse to worst.

THOUGHTS: A long-time silly cinema staple. It's nice to see this old horror film get a new lease on life thanks to the gang at Shout! Factory. All of the actors play this deadly serious, without going too far off the beam. Star Peter Dyneley is someone I had never seen before or since, but he's actually quite good playing an amiable newspaperman who ends up literally his own worst enemy. THE MANSTER is a clear precursor to absurd spliced-killer dreck like THE THING WITH TWO HEADS and THE INCREDIBLE TWO-HEADED TRANSPLANT. Surprisingly enough, in some ways THE MANSTER plays like a 1950's version of ALTERED STATES - only the end result terror is more physical than metaphysical. There's lots of violence & more than a little misogyny, but it's kept mostly off-screen. Though filmed in Japan, all of the dialogue is shot in English, including the villainous mad doctor (Satoshi Nakamura) and the Tokyo police inspector (Jerry Ito). The effects are pretty decent, with the classic ""eye coming out of the shoulder"" scene being a real showstopper. The final separation of man & beast is equally memorable and was probably pretty shocking, for its time. THE MANSTER is ferociously fun and thoroughly whacked out, with plenty of old school monster mayhem to be had. It's very re-watchable as well, which makes this hi-def presentation an even better deal. And speaking of...

THE BLU-RAY: The Blu-ray presentation of THE MANSTER comes courtesy of Shout! Factory, and the transfer is pretty decent overall. Blacks are solid, mid-tones are strong and the focus is sharp. There's very little artifacting, pixelation, edge enhancement or crush. Audio is clean and the soundmix is level. Regrettably, there is no bonus content. After suffering for decades with crappy, washed out, pan & scan Public Domain quality copies, this Blu-ray of THE MANSTER is a revelation of sorts. Certainly worth owning if you enjoy this kind of fare. Recommended.",1509753600,,2496,4.882075471698113

7975498,3,B00007ELFG,"This review is for the Blu-ray release of 'The Manster' released by Shout Factory! In August, 2017.

NOTE: This movie is also known as 'The Split.'

BLU-RAY: This release has a decent picture like many of these 50's science fiction movies (this was released in 1962). It is not perfect. There are some scratches and imperfections but the picture is pretty clear most of the time. So if you are looking to upgrade for picture quality then you should go ahead.

EXTRA'S: This is not the strong point of this release. You get a photo gallery and you get subtitles. That's it.

PLOT/SUMMARY:  Larry Stanford is a foreign news correspondent working in Japan. He wants to get home to his wife in the United States. He is asked to do one final assignment before he heads home. Larry is sent to a mountaintop scientific laboratory to interview a scientist who is supposed to be working on something unusual. Dr. Suzuki is somewhat evasive but hints at being able to move evolution forward by using scientific methods. Suzuki does not tell Larry that he has experimented on humans with mixed results. While he has shown some progress he has ruined some lives (in fact he has ruined the life of his wife.) Suzuki gives Larry a drink that he has drugged. While Larry is passed out he injects him with his secret formula. His assistant Tara reluctantly goes along with him.
Dr. Suzuki, with the help of Tara, befriends Larry and takes him out on the town, so to speak. He spoils him to keep him from leaving. After some time has passed, Larry no longer wants to go home and is prone to angry outbursts. He also notices some changes to his body. Larry's wife comes to Japan to find out what has happened to him. Larry becomes increasingly enraged when his wife and editor try to get him to return home.
Shortly thereafter, people start dying.
From here we find out what has happened to Larry and we learn the details of experiments. Dr. Suzuki and Tara are both morally conflicted as to how to handle the situation that has gotten out of control.

OBSERVATIONS/COMMENTS:  ***SOME SPOILERS*** (Yeah I  know, if you are reading this you have undoubtedly seen this movie)

This movie is not as bad as you might think, given the premise. I was never bored and the Japanese setting and Japanese actors mixed with American actors gave it a different feel and differentiates it from most science fiction films. There were a few Japanese pure science fiction movies that were released in the United States but in the science fiction/fantasy genres they are mostly known for their giant monster (kaiju) movies. In fact this might really be more of an American movie that was shot in Japan. From what I've read, the producers were American.

I actually thought the ending had a somewhat different conclusion than most 'man turns into monster' movie. Almost always, during this time period, the man/monster dies at the end (ex. Frankenstein Monster, Mr. Hyde, etc.) due to the production codes of the time not allowing any evil deeds to go unpunished. In addition, Larry was cheating on his wife....heaven forbid! While the movie does not definitively state that Larry Stanford is innocent, it implies that he very well might go unpunished. By having his evil twin actually tear away from his body, it can be presumed that the twin was guilty of the murders. Thereby, giving the a rare upbeat ending for the man/monster even though Hollywood is famous for it's upbeat endings.

If I were to watch this movie with someone who had never seen it, I would not want them to see any pictures of the movie. The most common image you see is a shot of the eye on Larry Stanford's shoulder. When I saw this movie the first time, I had not seen that image and it was somewhat jarring when the eye was revealed. It was a good effect and memorable. Of course now it has lost it's effect because I know it's coming.

I learned a long time ago not to expect the science in any of these old time science fiction films to be anywhere near realistic (of course, you can't today either!) It's a bonus when every now and then you get some sort of scientific premise that at least sounds somewhat plausible, if not possible. I don't expect realistic plots but I do want the actors to behave in a realistic way. Don't expect anything even
remotely plausible here. A person's evil side turning into a siamese twin and splitting from your body is as unrealistic as it gets!

The movie took liberties with distances and time but then again most movies do. Larry after being chased by the police near his home somehow manages to get to the remote mountaintop laboratory in very short order. OK....minor complaint.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Obviously recommended for all collectors of 50's and 60's science fiction movies. Also obviously for fans of Japanese science fiction cinema.
If you are looking for the best print of this movie. Well...it's in blu-ray so once again obviously this is the print to get!

I give the movie 2 1/2 stars. It's not great. It's not terrible. The extra's are minimal. I add a half star for the pretty good print and voila, we get 3 stars.",1505865600,6,5111,4.632044198895028
