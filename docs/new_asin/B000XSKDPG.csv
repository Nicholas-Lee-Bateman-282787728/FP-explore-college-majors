8229464,4,B000XSKDPG,"42nd Street Forever Vol. 3: Exploitation Explosion is a hour and forty-one minutes of some of the zaniest trailers from the seventies and the eighties.  Covering a whole range from action to horror to raunchy comedies to sci-fi, this DVD collects nearly all genres. The highlight of the show is a very entertaining commentary by Fangoria Editor Mike Gingold, AvManiacs Editor Edwin Samuelson and film historian Chris Poggiali, as they give mini reviews for the movie that each trailer represents.
If you like trailers then you'll love these.
Be warned though; the trailers themselves are in rough shape and they have been cropped so they can be better viewed in a widescreen TV.",1218758400,16,678,5.0
