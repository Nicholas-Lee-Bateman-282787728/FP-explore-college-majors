7913731,5,B00000JW9Y,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen because of the unexpected depth of the characters, the cartoonish ones, the artistic philosphers, and the good ol boys.  It gives you a sense about what Texas is like, and even though it was shot in the mid 90's, it's still applicable to today.  ***** stars in my book",1309219200,,313,4.473684210526316
7913732,5,B00000JW9Y,"It's a tragedy that I've lived in Amarillo for 5 years and have only now seen this movie. Ratliff manages to mix the absurdly humorous and frightening aspects of this town and the nuclear bomb disassembly/assembly facility housed here, and gives a great forum to some of the most interesting people in this town. I did laugh through a lot of it but I have to admit that I was nervously looking over my shoulder to the North-East when I did it.

In the end, it's a great tribute to Mr. Ratliff, this movie, and the ever entertaining Amarillo population that the most well known nutcase in the panhandle of Texas comes out as the most intelligent and well spoken ""character"" in Plutonium Circus.",1105920000,7,693,4.588709677419355
