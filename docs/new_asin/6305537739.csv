The actors were alot of fun to be around and did a really good job especially Michael Madsen. Ok maybe I am a bit partial, but I still think its a good B movie.",1265500800,,338,3.985294117647059
7891111,4,6305537739,"I won't lie and say this movie was a great movie, but it was worth the money to buy it.  I am not sure if this was Travolta's first film that he directed, but he did a decent job.  What brought the movie together was the interesting cast.  The indestructable Gary Busey, and the scene-stealing Michael Madsen alone make this movie worth watching.  If you are a fan of either of these guys, you will not be disappointed.",997920000,4,419,4.333333333333333
