With the exception of a pie in the face, the second film had much more appropriate content.  I would love to watch this with my girls.  The lead character had good character and was dynamic.  The outcomes were great and realistic.  It was just enough reality and just enough storybook to strike a perfect balance.  It's not Shakespeare, and it's not supposed to be, just a good clean film to watch with nicely acted characters and a good overall storyline.",1483488000,2,602,4.5092592592592595

I wasn't expecting a film regarding adult film actresses trying to reform themselves on a horse ranch ran by a adult film director ""trying to make good and change his life."" If I was aware of the actual content I wouldn't have ordered it for my kids to watch. Luckily I returned to the play loft where the film was on display for them roughly 35 minutes in, such that they wouldn't be subjected to the entire film (which strangely they seemed to enjoy and they protested when I turned it off and snapped the video in half). With that said I found the action sequences with the horses well done from a cinematic standpoint.

Some great stunt riding and getting to look behind the scenes of the rodeo cowgirls trick riding surround the world of a young girl who when things are not going her way finds out that she was adopted.  Having trouble dealing with this she goes off to spend some time with her adopted grandparents and a wise and all knowing grandpa (Keith Carradine) who takes everything in stride - except her birth mother (another side story there).  Grandpa now has a ranch of miniature horses.  This is a real treat for kids to see how their handled and learn about them.  Lots of side stories circling the main plot to keep you interested.  Good acting, great rodeo trick riding, fun little horses and plenty of entertaining friendships, family and bonding.  Well worth the watch.  Clean fun for the family.",1426982400,2,893,4.6075949367088604

6261834,5,B00IEXX4XA,Loved this movie.  I was not familiar with trick riding and it's every young girl's dream.  Better than being a princess!  It's wonderful to have a family film that adults enjoy and is appropriate for children.,1422403200,,210,4.777777777777778

6261851,5,B00IEXX4XA,I bought this movie for my stepdaughter as a Christmas gift. My husband was on the crew when it filmed here (Louisiana) and got her a small background spot. We rented it from redbox and she loved the movie. To me it was kind of a generic story. I kind of felt like it was the same plot as in other movies for that age range. But honestly I don't think the movie industry really has any fresh material so that is nothing to really hold against the movie. My stepdaughter just turned 13 so I would say it is great for approx. ages 8-15ish. My 5 year old son loved it because he got to see his sissy. He actually sat down and watched a good bit of it although I doubt he really understood the story. Anyhow she loved it and that's all that matters.,1418601600,3,745,4.074829931972789

6261892,5,B00IEXX4XA,"This is a tender film about the difficulties and beauties of adoption, adopted families and birth families.
At the same time, it is a film that is accessible to children.
Some of the issues are understated, but there is real, if gentle, substance here.",1400371200,,252,4.75
6261893,5,B00IEXX4XA,This movie was definitely a cute children's movie. But even though I still enjoyed it and will probably end up buying it.,1399248000,2,121,4.545454545454546
6261894,4,B00IEXX4XA,"I vaguely remember the first movie coming out, but I never saw it. Now that my little girl and I sat down to watch this installment, I will need to pick up the first one for her to watch as well.  You don't have to see the first one, as this does not appear to be a sequel  but another story about a Rodeo Sweetheart!

This story follows Dakota, a young woman who learns she is adopted.  Dakota goes on a journey of self discovery to search for who she really is and her ""real"" family.  She does go on to meet her biological mother,  but soon realizes that things happen for a reason. This is a great family movie and when I watched it with my daughter, we were able to talk about what was going on, why Dakota was so upset and why she needed to take the time to find herself. This movie is chalk full of valuable lessons of love and forgiveness.  I really enjoyed this film and the time I had with my daughter watching it!

I did get this product for a review purpose",1398816000,3,968,4.057894736842106
6261895,3,B00IEXX4XA,"Remember when you would come home from school and watch the 'After-School Special'? It was always a wholesome movie, perfect for impressionable young minds to watch. That is exactly what crossed my mind while I was watching this film.
Basically it's about a girl who finds life is not what she thought it was. It leads her to rediscover herself and see what things are not really any different than they were before. The same people and family in her life still love her and that's really all that matters.
So, it's not a movie that will win Oscar's in my opinion, but you can be sure knowing you and your family are watching a good movie, filled with great moral content and values.",1398556800,2,683,4.516129032258065
6261896,4,B00IEXX4XA,"Unrealistic? Sure. But films like ""Dakota's Summer"" are a welcome oasis for children who live in an increasingly complicated world that offers many more chances for heartbreak than heartwarming moments. It's formulaic, it's predictable, and nothing really bad happens to anyone. Yet those darned horses are as therapeutic for viewers as they are for the troubled kids in the film, and the characters are ones we care about. There's a place for light drama and formulaic, feel-good movies, and as that genre goes, ""Cowgirls `n Angels: Dakota's Summer"" is an entertaining film that will definitely appeal to the target audience, and maybe even the entire family--Familyhometheater.com",1398470400,2,682,5.443396226415095
6261897,4,B00IEXX4XA,But not as good as the first one. Of course my daughter loves it because of the trick riding. I guess it's all how you look at it.,1398038400,,130,3.6785714285714284
6261898,5,B00IEXX4XA,"We loved the movie. Its like a Disney film from 10 years ago ( Disney should make movies like this!), with a lot of heart and values.  The story is is solid and believable and the trick riding and courage of the riders unbelievable, unbelievable.  My only concern is that we may have to pay for more horseback lessons for our daughter after watching this film,",1397952000,,360,4.4393939393939394
6261899,5,B00IEXX4XA,"My family and I completely agree with the previous review. This is a great family friendly movie which are so few and far between these days.  The message in this film is beautiful and heartwarming: Families come in all shapes and sizes! The actors and acting brought, what could have been, a really cheesy DVD movie to an elevated level.  You just can't help falling in love with Haley Ramm as Dakota Rose.",1397692800,,407,4.561643835616438
6261900,5,B00IEXX4XA,"This is a sweet caring story about a girl coming to terms with her own past.  For those with a history or interest in adoption or foster care, this story will especially hit home.  No, this movie will not win Oscars but you can tell it is written, acted and produced from the heart.  This movie is very similar to something you would see on the Hallmark channel.",1397433600,7,362,4.294117647058823

It's a good coming of age story and adapting to difficult things in life. Plus there are the horses and that makes this movie amazing. Trick riding for the win!,1518220800,,287,4.142857142857143

8641684,4,B00IEXX4XA,"This Movie is a litle more low-key than the other two Cowgirls movies but does contain some good acting talent. The Birth mother is familiar from Pictures of Hollis Woods and I don't even remember the last movie I saw with Keith Carradine playing a grandfather. The locations are alright... The rodeo falls look like they hurt and the foster girls green eyes are plenty mesmerizing. If the Cowgirls series coninues I hope the "" Off-Character "" films are at least as easy on the eyes as this one.  Definitely a relaxation weekend or family favorite movie.
