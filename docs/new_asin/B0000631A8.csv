1686687,5,B0000631A8,"This is a BBC TV documentary that takes us behind the scenes for the recording of the final opera of Wagner's Ring -- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung -- for Decca Records in the early 60s. The very engaging story behind the recording of the Decca Ring is presented in record producer John Culshaw's book ""Ring Resounding,"" and this documentary is a nice complement to the book (which briefly discusses filming of the documentary). Culshaw's book made recording the Ring seem like commanding an army -- huge amounts of logistics and all manner of problems (not the least of which were tempermental singers). The documentary is hugely enjoyable as we see how several scenes in a great recording was made (and all the tension that ensued in making it). An added bonus of this DVD is that it includes a very generous (70-80 minutes) of audio highlights from the full Ring recording in Dolby Digital Surround Sound -- a bonus that really adds to the value of the DVD.
Buy it an enjoy it!",1046649600,8,976,4.747058823529412
1686688,5,B0000631A8,"A unique glimpse into one of classicals music's historical moments...the recording of the Ring cycle.  Hear the voices and see the people who made this event happen.  Even if you have the older VHS, get this DVD.",1043280000,4,212,4.702702702702703
1686689,5,B0000631A8,"A real documentary with planned and spontaneous interviews with the principals of this great landmark project. Solti called the Decca recording engineers, ""high priests of perfection"" and viewing John Culshaw and the other engineers as they put the project together is quite a good peek into the magic. Not only that, but good behind the scenes talks with the singers and  Solti himself which enables the viewer to re-live the experience. The film is great at evoking the tension, drama and finally the achievement of making a landmark recording.
In comparison to the vhs version, this new dvd release has extra film footage and a lot of music besides. High quality sound rounds out this fantastic documentary.",1032912000,10,710,5.068376068376068
1686700,5,B0000631A8,"Of course it's a great dvd...seeing the legends at work etc.
But did anyone else notice that Solti arrived in Vienna on a Comet jet?
Shortly there after a Comet blew apart in midair...but it was declared safe and than another blew apart.
After extensive testing it was found the air frame was defective and the Comet was permanently junked!

What a lucky escape for Solti and music.  Yes everyone smoked but it didn't affect those great voices...did it?",1287964800,3,453,4.7215189873417724
1686701,5,B0000631A8,"If you never heard Birgit Nilsson perform live, experience her power and perfection on DVD. In this 88-minute BBC documentary from 1965, Sir Georg Solti takes on the herculean project of recording, for the very first time, the entire ""Ring Cycle.""  Filmed during the recording of ""Gotterdammerung"" in Vienna, with Solti conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.  In addition to la Nilsson, it features performances by Wolfgang Windgassen, Gottlob Frick and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.  Also included:  interview footage with Solti and BBC production director John Culshaw.",1276041600,8,564,5.759036144578313
1686702,5,B0000631A8,"I am so glad that I bought this 1964 documentary!  My audio recording of Gotterdammerung is the Solti, so to see the performers is just fantastic.  Nilsson, Solti, Windgassen, Fisher-Dieskau and Culshaw and that wonderful VPO - this is such a gift.  I was sorry to miss the exceptional Christa Ludwig who sang Waltrude, but most likely that portion was recorded in the first session.
The intensity, dedication, & respect demonstrated by these artists is from a bygone era, I feel.  Great vignette of Solti and Culshaw discussing the tempo of Seigfried's Funeral March - Culshaw had tons of confidence and charm and smarts.
A few things from that era that we are better off without: the smoking - my goodness, how did those singers smoke and keep their voices?  And only one lone woman in the orchestra, a harp player.
If you love Wagner, you will love this.  If you don't know Wagner, this might be a place to start.",1268352000,6,916,4.658385093167702
1686703,5,B0000631A8,"This black-and-white BBC television documentary captures scenes and interviews from the making of Decca's ""G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung"" by Sir Georg Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic in Vienna in 1965 -- the final recording in Solti's Ring Cycle. The documentary does not cover any of the other operas in the Cycle, just G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung. In addition to the original television recording, clocking in at 88 minutes, there are also 69 minutes of remastered audio highlights from the entire cycle.

I really enjoyed the documentary and its look behind the scenes at what many regard as the greatest recording ever of the complete Ring Cycle. The tremendous time and expense of making the recording are apparent. It made me wonder whether any record companies would be willing or able to put this kind of care and investment into productions today.

Solti says in an interview that the schedule called for a minimum of 15 minutes of completed recording every day. The documentary shows examples of the process of takes and retakes, honing the sound of each passage until perfect. The producers also took costly steps such as the manufacturing of new Stierhorns, which are used briefly in Acts 2 and 3 of the opera. (Presumably the same horns had already been used in Die Walk&uuml;re.)

It is also wonderful to see some of the opera greats of the day, including Birgit Nilsson and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, performing in the studio setting and speaking about the recording process -- not to mention doing things that are unthinkable today, like smoking! In fact, it seems the whole cast, crew and orchestra was smoking most of the time -- very strange to see today. The film gives a nice picture of the personalities and processes involved in these great recordings. Highly recommended!",1249171200,15,1790,5.102389078498294
1686704,5,B0000631A8,"When PBS aired this documentary in the 1960's, I was not only fascinated by the studio recording mechanics but AWED BY THAT MUSIC! I listened to both rock n' roll and classical music in that order; but this program marked a hinge moment in my life.  To answer those criticisms that one must know the foreign language to appreciate the text of a particular opera, I knew just a handful of German words and nothing about the Niebelung myth.  Yet, those grand, lush, motif-laden, and passionate sounds gave my teenage hormones a transcendent experience. Translation:  I was blown away.

  As corny as it may sound, I was hooked on Wagner from that presentation.  I have a polite personality, but I remember persistently annoying my mother for a month's advance of my $3.00 per week allowance ($12.00) to purchase the monaural recording of Gotterdammerung. (Oh, my goodness, was I becoming Wagnerian in temperament?)  That opera exposed me to the entire Ring, then to the opera canon, lieder, oratorios, instrumentalists, and other classical formats. Most fans ease into classical music, and especially opera, with Carmen or Don Giovanni.  I charged into opera through one of its most complex works. Happily, this wonderful session is  preserved on DVD.",1239494400,36,1249,5.048780487804878
1686705,5,B0000631A8,A recording of such a scale is revealed in this DVD. Only down side is that the Decca people didn't record the first session but what you'll experiance in the last is worth every penny!,1200182400,8,185,4.314285714285714
1686706,5,B0000631A8,"After reading John Culshaw's memoir of the Ring recording, Ring Resounding, I have looked for the BBC documentary. I first found it on LaserDisc and truly enjoyed the experience of watching Gotterdammerung being recorded. After moving beyond that obsolete format, I looked for the DVD version. While it showed up as being made, it was no longer availalbe. Following the death of Birgit Nilsson, Decca (London) reissued the DVD. Thank you!

The technical aspects of the DVD are superb--the sound is clean and thrilling (even though it is in Dolby Digital Mono for the documentary portion). The Culshaw decision to require the BBC to use the sound as recorded by Decca, instead of their own sound, has stood the test of time very well. The Dolby Digital 5.1 remastering of key segments from the entire Ring recording was a great addition to the DVD that was not on the older LaserDisc format. As noted by others, it would be a joy to have a re-issued Ring on DVD in a new digital remastering. It should be noted that the remastering does not produce a ""movie-like"" sound stage.

The real treasure is seeing talent at work. The singers were the best of their generation, and some without peer even today. The production staff's dedication to achieving what some have called 'the greatest achievement in recording history' is palpable. It reminds one how much great recorded music the world has lost due to the premature death of John Culshaw. To see the Vienna Philharmonic and Georg Solti at work is a very rare treat.

In short, this DVD is very highly recommended. It works for Wagnerites, music lovers, those interested in recording, and opera producers and directors (imagine if Wagner's, or any other composer's intentions were so closely followed in the theater).",1191974400,68,1767,4.883333333333334
1686707,4,B0000631A8,"I have a DVD of ""The Golden Ring"", which is a BBC documentary on the production of a portion (Acts II and III of Goetterdaemmerung) of the first complete recorded Ring cycle.  If I recall correctly I bought it several years ago from Amazon.  So what is this new thing they're trying to sell me that's about to be released on DVD, ""Golden Ring (Sub Ac3 Dol DTS)""?  My only disappointment with what I have--and it is a very trivial one--is that whereas the sound of the Decca Ring is stunning stereo for its time (late 50's to late 60's) the sound on this BBC film soundtrack is mono.  Is it possible someone went back to the original multitrack studio takes and derived Dolby and DTS sound from them, and re-dubbed them?  Doubtful, but if it were I'd be tempted to buy it.  As it is this ""product page"" is sadly typical of many of Amazon's: absolutely useless for gleaning any information of interest.  A person who had no idea of what it is would be even more baffled.  Georg Solti an actor?",1186099200,19,991,4.377049180327869
1686708,5,B0000631A8,"How very fortuitous that John Culshaw and Gordon Parry, along with Humphrey Burton from BBC, were able to ""coerce"" Maurice Rosengarten to go for the recording of this documentary on the recording of ""Die Gotterdammerung"" from the Monumental Decca Solti Ring Cycle.

This truly was a miracle that these sessions should have been filmed and saved for posterity, showing us the love and care, and detail and effort that went into these marvelous recordings, that even today, 48 years or so later, have not been seriously rivaled by newer recordings.........simply awesome.......look at Solti, and listen to him talk about, pulling this performance out 15 minutes worth per 12 hour day at a time.......Birgit Nilsson, Wolfgang Windgassen, Gottlob Frick, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Claire Watson performing, and at Culshaw and his team sweating out at the controls, bringing it all together, little puzzle piece at a time to create the whole homogenous epic recording. Simply not to be missed.

Sadly, this dvd is out of print at the present. I luckily obtained my copy on eBay recently, still sealed, at an elevated but still reasonable price. One might contact Decca, and see if they have plans to perhaps re-release it, with a ""restored"" picture......it shows it's age, but does not diminish it's powerful impact to entertain, and enlighten, and show the efforts of all behind the monumental task of recording works like these in the studio....especially way back in the early 60's, before recording really came into the so-called ""modern"" age.

Again, NOT TO BE MISSED!

August 9, 2007 UPDATE!

The ""word in the grapevine"" seems to be that this is about to be re-issued again, so this will be a most fortuatous thing, and, I would expect, it will be ""refurbushed"" et al, so this is certainly something to be watching for!",1163894400,6,1832,5.033003300330033
1686709,5,B0000631A8,"If you have never watched or listened to Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung, don't read any further--it would be a waste of your time.  This item really only has appeal for Wagnerites.

It is a documentary of Georg Solti's 1965 recording of Wagner's Ring.

You'll see the genius of Solti, as you hear his comments on what he was trying to do, and how he integrates orchestra rehearsals with the soloists.

There are interviews with Birgit Nilsson and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau on singing and some of the philosophy of the work.  Nilsson comments on how much more difficult a sound recording performance is, than an actual opera performance.

A special treat for devoted Wagnerites is seeing some of your favorite scenes being rehearsed and recorded for sound.

Exercise enthusiasts would be hard-pressed to put in as much energy as Solti does in his conducting.

Seeing this production will help you better appreciate all the many efforts that go into producing the recorded music you love.

As you grow to know Solti, you'll understand why his recordings of the Ring are regarded as the closest to perfection.",1101945600,7,1112,4.935483870967742
7958122,5,B0000631A8,"Whilst clearly a promotional video for a landmark audio recording, this documentary conveys much insight. Solti talks intelligently about the difficulties of recording in what has come to be known as ""bleeding chunks'. Nilsson gives insight into the difference from a singer's perspective between an onstage performance and a studio recording. Culshaw's role as recording supremo rather surprised me, despite having read his memoir of the recording: ""Ring Resounding"". The idea that he would tell Solti what tempo to take for the funeral march staggers me, as well as the fact that Culshaw, rather than Solti, dictates which takes will make it to the final pressing. Fischer-Dieskau and Solti talk intelligently about the contrast between Wagner the man and Wagner the artist. In addition, the DVD contains audio versions of essentially the cycle's ""Greatest Hits"". Shot in the mid-60s, the documentary conveys the ubiquity of smoking in much the same way as Mad Men did. I guess today's singers would put an absolute ban on anyone smoking in their presence, but this obviously did not apply 50 years ago and the fact that Fischer-Dieskau - a legendary baritone - was himself a smoker at the time came as a real shock.",1502582400,,1218,5.064676616915423
7958123,5,B0000631A8,"First of all, with all due respect to and reference to the review of D. L. Lawrence dtd. 10/25/2010, Maestro Georg Solti (1912-1997) arrived at the Vienna airport on a French Sud Aviation Caravelle, with two rear fuselage mounted jet engines, not a British de Havilland Comet, which has four jet engines mounted in the wings. This review is of the Laser Disc version of this video, but, the quality thereof is quite satisfactory. The insight offered here into this ground breaking early stereophonic recording (1958-1965) of the complete Ring Cycle is just fascinating. In his own words respected Decca classical music recording producer John Culshaw (1924-1980) thought that a properly made sound recording should create ""a theatre of the mind"". When listening to any of these four recordings of the Wagner operas, there is an immediate perception of ""depth"" as an audience would experience in an opera house. And the listener can also discern that the singers are moving about just as they would on an opera stage, not remaining in a static position before a microphone. In her book ""La Nilsson"" the revered Swedish dramatic soprano Birgit Nilsson (1918-2005) bemoans the fact that so many modern operatic staged productions are not done ""in the spirit of the thoughts of the Composer"". In these recordings Culshaw has done just that, attempted to follow all of Wagner's staging and instrumental instructions as faithfully as possible. And remember that in Wagner's Bayreuth "" Festspielehaus"" the orchestra is not visible to the audience. In this reviewer's opinion he has succeeded! And what's more, he managed to assemble the most outstanding group of operatic performers that could be employed at this particular point in time, over a seven or so year period. Convincing Kirsten Flagstad (1895-1962), for example, to perform the role of Fricka in Das Rheingold, which she never did on stage, was a master stroke, preserving her special singing talent as part of the particular operas which made her so famous. She was already past sixty years of age when Das Rheingold was recorded and her failing health sadly prevented her from participating in any of the later recordings.",1470355200,,2180,5.092178770949721

Nillson, Windgassen, Gottlub Frick, Fischer-Dieskau - wow! And then there is the ultimate star who put this perfect Wagnerian world together - Georg Solti.

There are conductors, and there are other great ones, but to see the master at work for 80+ minutes is a tribute to the genius of producer/Wagner expert/author John Culshaw.

This is a 'no brainer' purchase that will be replayed from time time in this household...and that's for sure. Buy it and see and hear what I mean.

PS All of the singing is superb, but the standout performer I had never set eyes upon was Gottlub Frick...a better Hagen there is not. His bass voice from this relatively diminutive body type is a huge surprise. His performance alone  is worth the price of this DVD.",1330819200,2,901,4.8311688311688314

Watching Solti conduct will convince you that aerobics did not just spring up in the eighties.  The man was fearless in his interpretation.  It is truly fascinating to see great artists at work and does give one an appreciation of the time and sweat involved in creating a masterpiece.  The section on getting the horns to sound just right was very interesting.  Fascinating piece of visual history that is a must-have if you are a Wagner fan or for that matter just like opera.
