8307459,2,B001GZM45M,"I chose to purchase and watch this movie because Jeff Novick is featured in it. Jeff Novick is a registered dietician that I greatly admire and as such, I expected for there to be a lot more information in this film about food. Unfortunately, there is no clear guidance provided in this film about food. If anything, the film inaccurately minimizes the importance of diet in one's health and waistline.

Other inaccuracies featured in this film included the idea that carbohydrates are unhealthy and depression as a cause of obesity. Miles' physician failed to refer him to a registered dietitian, and criticized the one physical activity the man was enjoying: boxing. As an exercise physiologist, this really got under my skin. She's a physician. She knows medicine. If you need information about food, see a registered dietitian. If you need help with exercise, see a trainer that is registered with one of the national organizations like ACE, ACSM, etc. Do not depend on your physician for this information; they are not trained in this area. As for the trainer that succeeded in aiding Miles' weight loss, good on him. My only qualm with this part of the film was his calculations for body fat. There is no way under the sun Miles was 26% body fat to begin with and 12% at the end of the film. 12% body fat in a man is that of a fairly ripped body. He certainly reduced his body fat, which is the important message. But I would guess that he was well over 40% body fat to begin with and maybe 30-35% body fat at the end.

I would not recommend this film for anyone that is trying to get practical, usable information on a healthy lifestyle.",1402704000,,1644,4.58843537414966
8307460,3,B001GZM45M,I liked the fact that is was real.  A real story.  Viewers could relate to the situation and the truthfullness of the situation.  I didn't not like it - it just didn't keep my attention as some other documentaries have done.  I would recommend it to friends who think there is no such thing as a reality show that can change your life.,1363824000,2,335,4.26984126984127

8307463,5,B001GZM45M,"I saw the film at the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival and it was not only entertaining but very informative as well! I would recommend this film to everyone, because I think all of us at one point or another have tried to shed those unwanted pounds, experiented with fad diets or contemplated surgey. Also, mad props to Miles Forman for the courage and bravery it took for him to share his trials and tribulations with a nation!",1229558400,7,440,4.653846153846154
