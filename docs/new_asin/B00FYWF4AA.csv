6040275,2,B00FYWF4AA,"My friend...this is MauroBosque, the Woodsman. Like your grandmother, I give this film 2 stars. I wanted to like it more because the actor gave a lot of heart. But in the end, will I recommend it for $3? Only if you are really desperate to kill time. Below are the details.

Spoiler Alert:
-I give it 1 star for the actor's great effort.
-I give it another star for the unique way it was filmed with only 1 guy talking to the camera the entire time! That was a big risk, because if he is unable to keep your attention, the movie could have gotten old really fast. He did a good job of holding the attention, so it gave the footage a unique feel.
-I subtract a star for the sound effects when he keeps hearing the thing in the woods (sounds like a guy banging a garbage can).
-I subtract a star for the movie going on much longer than it should have, and hence losing its build-up, and then lightning fast ending scene.
-I subtract a star for the whatever it was (King Kong? Sasquatch?) making a surgical precision strike on his camp to empty his water bottle, steal his knife, food, and multitool.
-And I subtract a bonus star because they killed off Chucho. How that even happened is a bigger mystery than the ape.
-The dialogue in the first 10 minutes of the movie is really annoying. I almost turned it off. Once he stops telling us who he is every 10 seconds, it becomes bearable.",1406937600,6,1384,4.282442748091603
6040276,3,B00FYWF4AA,"Need a 3.5 rating here. I liked this film, lots of nice build-up and the kind of approach that works for found-footage fans. But the monster is really a let-down and the ending comes and goes too quick. The way the found footage is presented is a bit different than many other films like this, and the fact that this came from Maverick is a nice surprise as that company hasn't had a good film in a long time. Rent this.",1404691200,4,420,4.197530864197531

6040283,5,B00FYWF4AA,"Very puzzling movie, Why make a movie that would feature the acting of one man, who is not a well known actor? The acting is not really that bad, but there is nothing here except the acting and while it is OK, it is not exceptional. Perhaps if it were deNiro or Hoffman I could understand it. I really enjoyed this movie but perhaps because it was so bad. Lots of funny things, this guy such a terrible Woodsman and Host. He says, ""it 's a good thing I brought my camera light"". (he is taking a three day hike and will be recording the whole thing). It should not be surprising that a camera light would be essential. However, he apparently didn't bring a flashlight and only has the camera light and a Bic flic. I really loved the line, ""This is a basic compass. It has N, E, S, and W"" (I guess the more expensive compasses have all of those other directions), as well as, another line that went something like this, ""It will take approximately 10 hours, give or take an hour"" (Thank you for the clarification. I always wondered what approximately meant). Watch for the part when he talks about the 12-foot steep bank and the timbers that may come crashing down upon him (I don't know, it actually looks more like a 3-foot gentle slope and a log spanning about 8-inches over a babbling brook. You should also try to figure out why anyone would keep a light on and maintain chatterbox mode when trying to hide from a vicious nocturnal predator, and come up with a theory for the disappearance of these mysterious 'cave-dwelling' Mayans. A very (probably unintentionally) funny movie. I really liked it.",1503187200,2,1602,4.489726027397261

6040300,2,B00FYWF4AA,"the scenery is good. The idea was good. You had some moments that you were tense waiting for jump scares. NOW.......within the first 5 minutes their had to be 20 or more F bombs. The main character never shows any survival skills. He attempts to, then they either skip it or says he's sorry for not filming it. He won't shut up about being pissed at his producer and drops more f bombs. All you will see is a guy you will hate, walking down trails, scared of noises around him, bragging that he is the all mighty woodsman. If I didn't pay for it I would have shut it at 15 minutes. Could have been great if they used the right actor, or maybe this guy could do a 180 and act like a real survivalist and not be a babbling potty mouth baby. Cursing is fine, this was idiotic.

6040307,3,B00FYWF4AA,"**NO SPOILERS** OK, we all know that, all too often, we can get suckered in to some utterly terrible movies just by the DVD cover artwork, then spend the hour after the rental pouring hot coffee on our keyboards and throwing pillows at the screen with buyer's remorse. This is the only instance I have some across in the 300+ movies I've reviewed on Amazon where the super-cheesy (in this case, some kind of ""bloody-Cujo-monkey"") DVD cover actually almost made my pass up a pretty darn good movie. The plot is not original - a reality show made being shot in first-person in the wild/forest/jungle with the host being stalked by... something...most of which turn out to be one-star microbudget weekend shoot disasters.

This one is in this subgenre; however, it proved to be one of the rare few that is well acted (there's just one primary actor here), and the ""monster"" while only making a very brief appearance, is actually fairly cool and believable. There are a couple of scares, and the camera work, esp being found footage, is really not bad. I'd definitely recommend NOT passing on this one just because the DVD cover looks like you're in for yet another lame excuse for a monster movie.

Just to be clear: no, it's not great or terrifying or full of thrills, but it's a cut above the vast majority of films of this kind and I found it an enjoyable weekend couch viewing. I don't want to mislead anyone - this certainly isn't Blair Witch or anything you'd be going out of your way to revisit or reccomend to friends. I am simply saying that it is OK and found footage microbudget fans may find it worth a viewing. So, in short, it's a qualified ""yes.""",1419638400,6,1658,4.560402684563758

8619573,4,B00FYWF4AA,"If you're into the found footage horror/suspense genre, this is worth a watch. While it's no Hellhouse LLC or Blair Witch Project, it is genuinely suspenseful. My test of a good horror flick is to watch it in broad daylight and see if i still get the willies. This flick passed that test with flying colors. Granted, having to watch 90 minutes of painfully close up shots of the same noname actor was not my favorite, but the fact that they pass off texas as Belize fairly successfully is a testament to the filmmaker's ability to suspend our disbelief. The other thing that made this movie genuinely creepy is we only get one real look at the Bigfoot stalking him, and it's a poorly lit shadowy glimpse of him - but he looks super real (no cheap halloween leftover ape suits here) and super scary. And so all the suspense after that was pretty legit, cause you really almost start to be worried about the guy. I was hungry af with the munchies for the whole second half of the flick but couldn't manage to stop and make some grub, it really sucked me in. A great independent effort.",1527897600,,1083,4.447236180904523

8619578,3,B00FYWF4AA,"THE WOODSMAN (2012) is about an internet reality show called THE WOODSMAN. During filming an episode of THE WOODSMAN, the host / adventurer / survivalist, Mauro Bosque (Maurice Ripke aka: THE WOODSMAN), goes missing. This is another ""found footage"" film, so, obviously, we're watching a video that's been discovered, showing Bosque's fate. Filmed in Texas, THE WOODSMAN is supposed to take place in the wilds of Belize. The first thing we learn is how much pride Bosque takes in being THE WOODSMAN. Next, we discover his utter contempt for THE WOODSMAN's production team. He's also quite interested in the Mayans (they were too busy being extinct to appear in THE WOODSMAN). He believes he knows where to find some Mayan caves. Doing as THE WOODSMAN would do, Bosque takes a different route, other than the one agreed upon, in order to meet up w/ his team at a rendezvous point. Needless to say, nothing goes according to plan, and Bosque grows increasingly afraid, unlike the living embodiment of machismo, known as THE WOODSMAN. Bosque sets up camp. Hearing noises, he at first believes that someone is playing a prank on THE WOODSMAN. However, he soon realizes that whatever is going on, it's not being caused by anything human! Finally arriving at the caves, Bosque investigates them. He quickly finds himself up against more than just the elements, and what happened to THE WOODSMAN is revealed. As FF movies go, this one works fairly well. The reason for this is the performance of Ripke, who makes Bosque's growing terror -mostly- convincing. The complaints I have are #1- The length. This could easily have been cut down by at least 20 minutes. #2- The monster. We only see it for scant seconds. Once!  #3- The finale. It pretty much just ends. Fans of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT may enjoy this movie. Those tired of this entire genre, will probably fight to stay awake...

He is expert at what he does but his situation begins to deteriorate due to what he originally believes are people trying to get him to turn back. He makes one unfortunate decision after another before he realizes what he is up against.  What would possibly be more terrifying than seeing a monster?  Knowing a monster was out there stalking you and threatening you but never being able to see the monster.  The acting was brilliant and the concept truly unique.,1504137600,2,696,4.492063492063492
8619581,3,B00FYWF4AA,"I guess I liked this movie,  that is, after the first part where we had to listen to his travelogue about walking in the woods. I think it was because I wanted to see how far he would get trying to film a tv show, while trying to ignore the obvious.  But, he really wasn't much of a woodsman, if you ask me, because he sure didn't pay much attention to what us normal folks would have been pretty cautious about, and to think much harder about what it was that was howling out there and which did not sound like a man. And did he seriously continue to go all the way through the woods and across stream, all the while leaving his camera, and then have to come back and retrieve it, even after he became aware of ""something or someone"" pursuing him? And hey, how about that scene where he runs back to his tent and goes in it to hide, but didn't grab at least some of his gear right outside of the tent? Well, this not very bright ""woodsman"" did something that even most grandmothers would have told him not to do, go into a dark, unknown cave that smelled like an animal, and started exploring it.
I think this movie was worth watching just to see how foolish an experienced woodsman could be while taking a hike through the woods of Belize.",1503532800,2,1241,4.2100840336134455
