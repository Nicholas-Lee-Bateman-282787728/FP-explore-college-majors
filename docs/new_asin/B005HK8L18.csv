4702065,5,B005HK8L18,"I am so glad to finally have together on disc Tchaikovsky's finest symphonies, Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky orchestra. They really earn their reputation as the greatest orchestra for Tchaikovsky as Gergiev displays his ease of control throughout. The concerts are beautifully shot with close-ups on the players and conductor. This disc would be especially valuable as an educational tool to musicians and conductors studying Tchaikovsky and performance techniques.",1318464000,6,468,5.797101449275362
4702066,5,B005HK8L18,"I am one who believes that Tchaikovsky needs to be played by a Russian orchestra and conductor. In his interview on this disc, Gergiev says he believes a conductor must be a dancer to properly conduct Tchaikovsky. He doesn't mean on the podium,just understanding the dance. Judging by the seemingly endless plodding, dull, soul-less performances of these symphonies that have been churned out over the years by conductors who should know better, both of us are right!

My previous favorite video version of 4,5 & 6 has been by Fedoseyev and the Moscow Radio Symphony. They are very different from Gergiev's. The former does most things fast and faster, a bit like Mravinsky used to. Gergiev takes the scherzos in all three very fast, also, but in the other movements, he uses huge amounts of rubato, at some points almost grinding to a halt. Then he accelerates very quickly at climactic points - it's all very exciting stuff. The slow movements are very tender.

The Mariinsky Orchestra players(formerly the Kirov Ballet Orchestra) are wonderful. Their ensemble work is much better than Fedoseyev's band, which can get pretty ragged when pressed. They obviously know Gergiev's requirements - which are not modest.

Interestingly, he uses a baton for #4 - unusual for him. This is music-making of the highest order, and a screaming deal, if you get this disc (bluray)from Amazon UK.

Picture, editing and sound are flawless in the bluray version.

It's to be hoped we can get more from this source. Gergiev has been doing a lot of Mahler lately, in concert and #4 & 5 on dvd. Or how about some other Russian composers?

I still like my Fedoseyev a lot, but Gergiev is more interesting and introspective in this music. Don't hesitate.",1318291200,20,1733,4.877551020408164
4702067,5,B005HK8L18,Not often do we get to see Valery Gergiev up close and this DVD allows us the privilege of seeing the master in action. He is in complete command of the Mariinsky orchestra and the passion and commitment to the music is evident. The camera work is truly wonderful and perfectly in sync with the score. Much care and attention has been put into the making of this DVD and I would urge anyone interested in Tchaikovsky's final Symphonies to buy this above all others.,1318291200,11,465,4.482352941176471
4702068,5,B005HK8L18,"Likely every classical music lover owns at least one of the sets of Valery Gergiev conducting the Tchaikovsky symphonies 4 -6 (and probably many other recordings of other conductors and orchestras of these popular masterworks), but until seeing the live performances captured in January 2010 in the Salle Pleyel in Paris and hearing how Gergiev is committed to these scores then the zenith has not been experienced.  Not usually one to purchase a DVD of a orchestral performance until the recent spate of excellent ones, the actual close-the-eyes experience of truly hearing the performance is the test.  Have n fear.  This is an exception release.  Not only is Gergiev and his 'own' orchestra splendid in the symphonies 5 and 6 as he has been in his previous recordings, here he manages to prove that he has captured the special essence of the 4th symphony as well - not always the case in live or recorded performances in the past.

The sound is breathtaking, the orchestra is playing at its inimitable best, and being able to observe Gergiev's facial expressions of total involvement in these performances is, well, a wonder.  This is Tchaikovsky restored to the master he has always been.  Included in this experience is an informative interview with Gergiev in which he speaks form the heart about his honoring the master of Russian music.  This is a quiet interview, reflective, informative and adds to the experience of starting from the top and viewing this gold standard of Tchaikovsky symphonic performances again. This is an experience the listener and viewer will never forget.  Grady Harp, October 11",1318204800,20,1613,5.01123595505618
4702069,5,B005HK8L18,"A recent review in the LA Times said Valery Gergiev ""pushed"" his players during a recent tour performance.  This was recorded in France, and although it was probably part of an earlier tour, the playing was impressive.  The musicians don't put much physical ""oomph"" into their playing, but they really give an amazing performance of Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies.  Gergiev provides what I consider to be the best interpretations I've heard of any of these symphonies.  The sound quality is superb and the camera work is unobtrusive.  I felt like I was at the performance(s).  I spread the performances out over three days just to be able to savor the playing that much longer.  I recommend this disc without reservation.",1371513600,,726,5.0
4702070,3,B005HK8L18,"The performances are very good -- propulsive and exciting.

The sound is excellent, albeit slightly sterile, sounding almost as if it were recorded in a studio.

The video is poor, the worst I've encountered in a symphonic performance Blu-ray. A diffusion filter appears to have been used, and it softens the image, reduces detail and adds an unfortunate bloom to the whites.

Worse yet, the direction, camerawork and editing are awful. There are a lot of frequent cuts and overlapping images. At times, a freeze frame is used -- a very gimmicky effect that pulls you right out of the moment and makes you aware of the director. It made me appreciate even more the crystal-clear, well-directed EuroArts Blu-rays, which successfully convey a ""you are there"" quality that adds greatly to the excitement.

This was a lost opportunity.",1370736000,4,831,5.0
4702071,2,B005HK8L18,I am very disappointed in the audio quality of this DVD.  There are no stereophonic qualities in the audio (even with  the 5 channel  Dolby )  it sounds like a monaural recording.,1370649600,,179,4.5
4702072,3,B005HK8L18,"Gergiev's interpretation and his orchestra's performance of Tchaikovsky's 4th,5th&6th symphonies  are every bit as breathtaking as what all the enthusiastic reviewers are saying and reminds me very much of the buzz many years ago when Mravinsky and the legendary Leningraders took the music world by storm with their fresh, idiomatic approach. The audio recording too is excellent. More is the pity then that the picture quality of this release is one of the worse I have seen for a blu ray concert disc. I feel compelled to say something as nobody has taken the French TV guys to task for this appalling lapse in video standards. The color bias in the 4 th. symphony is too much towards the yellow- orange spectrum. Then suddenly when it comes to the 5th, everything takes on a drab bluish-grayish hue, and things get even more grey in the last symphony with the conductor's features acquiring a deathly hue which no amount of twiddling with the color controls could alleviate. What is going on here ? Poor lighting / exposure ? Injudicious use of a blue filter? Whatever the reason, potential purchasers would do well to take note...as they say caveat emptor !",1348704000,7,1162,4.839195979899498
4702073,4,B005HK8L18,"I had high hopes of this disc. All 3 symphonies are splendid examples of late-19th-century Russian romanticism, and who better to reveal their riches than an eminent Russian conductor and a Russian orchestra. The answer is a Latvian conductor and a Norwegian orchestra. The first is this DVD of a very recent set of performances, and the second is a moderately old CD. But I will make that comparison based on interpretation alone at the end of this review. The Mariinsky DVD offers impeccable sound and crisply clear images, although the camera work of the French production team has none of the artistry that craftsmen such as Brian Large and Humphrey Burton bring to their task. The shots change at a frenetic speed that often contrasts with that of the music, and we rarely see more than 10 consecutive seconds of poor old Valery. As it happens, that is not such a deprivation, for when he is not using a baton, as in the last two symphonies, he must qualify as the most gauche and visually-challenged conductor ever to have stepped onto a podium. Although I have heard him and the orchestra live on several occasions, thankfully, he has always had his back to me.
The 4th Symphony gets him off to a very unconvincing start. It is not the greatest of the three, and has earned its place in the repertory because it has plenty of fire and spirit, jolly folksy melodies, and a thematic coherence attributable to its programmatic reintroduction of motifs from earlier movements. Gergiev's ultra-slow tempi drain much of the excitement from  the first movement, and turn the second from a charmingly wistful lullaby into an ecclesiastical hymn. Things succeed much more convincingly in the last two, although even in these, his slower pace generates a performance less thrilling than those of his rivals.
The first movement of the 5th continues this note of lethargy, although it is brushed aside with a brutally vigorous middle section that raises the adrenaline to more customary levels. The Andante that follows benefits, up to a point, from the ponderously slow tempo at which it proceeds. It is the most spiritual of all 12 movements on this disc, and Gergiev interprets it as a psalm-like dirge. In the final movement, the tempo rises through a series of accelerating crescendos to a thrilling finish that leaves nothing to be desired. As for the 6th symphony,  one can only say that this is performed with total conviction once one gets past the main subject of the first movement. Listless in Gergiev's hands, it is hard to imagine this as the sexually-explicit theme-music to David Selznick's torrid masterpiece: DUEL IN THE SUN.
What Jansens does with these symphonies in his marvelous CDs for the Chandos label ( and likewise Mravinsky in his older performances with the Leningrad Phil ) is to milk them for all they are worth, and that is a lot. With both interpreters, there is a fierce intensity and a sense of raw commitment that contrasts with Gergiev's more measured and sometimes perfunctory approach. They accelerate the Andantes and Adagios well beyond the composer's literal injunctions in the score, just as Gergiev holds them back with a caution alien to Tchaikovsky. I have no doubt which approach the latter would have preferred, even to the point of changing his instructions. One final comment: I was astonished to count the number of players in the Mariinsky Orchestra as listed in the informative brochure. It came to 72. Considering that they are in competition with orchestras numbering well over 100 members, what they and Gergiev have achieved here and elsewhere in their recorded output is truly remarkable.",1329523200,,3641,4.91869918699187
4702074,3,B005HK8L18,"I am an unabashed fan of Valery Gergiev. I have considered his interpretations of the Russian and East European Composers as one of the best. However, this recording of the last three symphonies of Tchaikovsky left me totally unsatisfied. Maybe my expectations were a tad too high when I ordered for this.

I have no idea whether to blame the quality of the audio recording (I played it on my Yamaha/Bose combination and then on another good system) or the interpretation (or lack of it) by Gergiev, but the net effect is rather disappointing. The orchestra seems to have been left totally to itself to interpret, and there is no 'tightness' if I may address it so, in the cohesion and ensemble and parts of it appear even 'muddy'and maybe 'airy' to say the least. The strings sound rather tired throughout, and the various climaxes within the work seem a little sterile.

The video is the real redeeming factor here. In a home-video recording, I love to see the camera flit between the main and other instruments making the music and the conductor. Otherwise it becomes more like sitting in one position and watching much more of the conductor (like in Karajan recordings) or a meaningless collage of musicians making one want to switch off the screen and listen to the music only. Kudos.

Abbado with the Berlin in Japan as well as Abbado conducting in Caracas seem far more lively and spirited and bring out the essence of Tchaikovsky in their interpretations. This one comes nowhere near the other Russian greats like the old Rozhdestvensky or Mravinsky recordings (audio and interpretation), and one of the other benchmarks for me, the Ormandy/Philiadelphia ones....
Given the choice, I don't think I would recommend it as a 'worth buy' stuff.",1325203200,16,1748,4.859060402684563
4702075,5,B005HK8L18,"Having seen this Gergiev and his orchestra play at Carnegie Hall, I bought the blu-ray of this performance as a momento of my trip.  This is a great concert to own and enjoy.",1324857600,2,174,4.2727272727272725

La calidad de la filmacin de la cuarta es defectuosa en los primeros planos, en la velocidad en el cambio de imgenes y en el enfoque del director.

Sin duda las obras de compositores rusos con directores rusos y orquestas rusas produce efectos sonoros magnficos que no se encuentran en otras grabaciones. En esta grabacin prima lo emotivo nacional y el detalle de sonidos instrumentales que no se escuchan en otras versiones.

4702077,5,B005HK8L18,"This is a superb concert video.  Tchaikovsky couldn't possibly sound any better

4702078,5,B005HK8L18,"Yes, Tchaikovsky's music can be noisy, repetitive, even banal and sentimental in some passages, especially when it is not played ""right"" and without the proper feeling for its many layers of emotion, its surprisingly complex structures and its idiomatic syntax. When I approached Gergiev's set of the mature symphonies, my yardstick of excellence was the 1991 DVD Tchaikovsky Cycle by Vladimir Fedoseyev with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra (see my review). These are marvelous, idiomatic performances - though the video and audio are now somewhat dated - and I will return to them. Gergiev has the advantage of state-of-the-art audio and video. He also conducts one of the world's premier orchestras, the musicians on the tip of their collective toes during their tour, here captured in the acoustically benevolent Salle Pleyel in Paris. Gergiev's approach to the scores is free in the best sense: he uses frequent tempo shifts, a wide spectrum of sound from ppp to fff as well as much portamento, rubato, accelerando and diminuendo. He manages to bring off the Fourth (an uneven symphony) with passion and insight, lending it a stature rarely encountered in other performances. Both the Fifth and the Pathtique are poignantly felt, the former as an arduous, but ultimate affirmation of life, the latter in its shattering progression to final dark resignation. These are incredible, stunning and moving performances one must hear to appreciate. The interview with Gergiev shows him as an articulate, thoughtful musician who sheds new light on Tchaikovsky's music and the art of performance.",1318636800,13,1595,5.283464566929134

8473219,5,B005HK8L18,"Review of DVD of Tchaikosvky Symphnies 4  6,
Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, Saint Petersburg, Valery Gergiev, conductor

It appears to me that composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky remains the undisputed giant icon of Russian music for its people, even to this day despite, ironcially, the resurgence of government-encouraged homophobia rampant throughout the country.  His symphonies Nos. 4, 5, and 6 certainly confirm that.

For better or worse, Tchaikosvky's music continues to be popular with conductors and recording companies, and a remarkable number of recordings have been produced over the years.  The difficulty is that his music is romantic and requires necessary interpretation by the conductors.  This has been met with varying success.  Without my naming them, I recall a Soviet-era recording of the Pathtique that was uninspired and plodding.  I also heard a former Italian opera-conductor who produced a sing-song rendition that lacked the symphony's solemnity and dignity.  Other orchestras have produced admired performances that still lacked the full extent of Tchaikosvky's expression of angst, depression, and resignation in his Pathtique.

For many years, I was most impressed with the half-century-old recording by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  At last in 2010, conductor Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra have performed and recorded, what I feel to be in my humble opinion, the definitive interpretation of those three symphonies and especially the Pathtique.  Listening to the orchestra and watching Gergieve conduct leads me to believe that he has plumbed the very depths of Tchaikosvky's mind and soul.  Every note, every nuance is expressed with deep understanding and empathy.  I must believe that, like many of us since the fall of the Soviet Union, Gergiev knows the facts behind Tchaikosvky's premature death just days after his final symphony's performance, and Gergiev performs the symphony like a memorial to this giant in the world of music, this tragic man.

Anyone who truly cares for other people must be empathetic for Tchaikovsky and regret his having lead such a tortured life.  His brother Modest speculated that composing music was an attempt to drive out the somber demons that had so long plagued him.  We might wish that the man never have suffered so greatly.  Yet, without a life of suffering, we might never have had given to us such extraordinary music.  I'll go further; it is safe to say that  his Pathtique, this symphony of defeat, and especially the suicidal fourth movement, never would have been written as it was.  As for myself, who have appreciated the beauty and power of the Pathtique for so long, it is a sad consolation to have my sense, from the very first hearing, of the personal angst and resignation that Tchaikovsky was expressing, confirmed.  I heard his voice; I felt his despair, especially now with the Gergiev's insightful performances.",1438214400,,2943,5.297413793103448

Tchaikovsky 6:  Munch/Boston (RCA);  Ormandy/Philadelphia (Sony);  Karajan/Berlin Philh. (DG, 1976)

There is also a DG DVD of Karajan/Berlin in Tchaikovsky 4, 5, and 6 (r. 1973) which is filmed part live/part studio, which I find very satisfying.  It also costs 40% less than the Gergiev, which is BluRay;  Karajan is regular DVD.
