8630705,5,B008RZF690,"These movies are both horror movies that get you to jump or cringe.  Even though these movies are clearly made to be in 3D, they are still fine without the 3D.  There is nudity and topless scenes in both of these movies so parents be warned, the R rating is not just for language and violence.",1399593600,3,293,4.214285714285714

The only difference in these and the USA release is that it has FRENCH on the other side.",1389398400,3,258,4.51063829787234
