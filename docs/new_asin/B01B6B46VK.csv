8749355,5,B01B6B46VK,"Made in 1974 by film maker Peter Hall; this has now been restored to a high degree by the BFI. It is based on the book about a Suffolk village of the same name. It tells the story of the village of Akenfield through the lives who have lived there. This is centred around three generations of Tom Rouse.

It tells of the first Toms life working on a farm and living in a tied cottage  always dreaming of owning his own land and being too over worked and poor to ever countenance such dreams to the waking hours. It tells of the love that draws him to home and the burning desire to get away as they co-mingle in his heart and mind.

This is done like a pastoral poem in places with the musical score perfectly balanced to capture the on screen mood and chemistry. It is part history, social commentary and part melancholy in its approach to a bucolic past that some would now miss and others are glad to be rid of. This is a film for those who take cinema seriously and love our shared history on film.",1474761600,,1001,4.176165803108808
