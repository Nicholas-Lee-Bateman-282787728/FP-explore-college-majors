2061420,3,B000244FZU,I enjoyed this version of Sherlock Holmes. It was well made and the actors gave excellent portrayals. I would recommend this dvd to all who like good mysteries.,1219881600,,160,4.75
2061421,3,B000244FZU,"The motivation for this telefilm seems to have been, Let's jump on the Sherlockian bandwagon, shall we? While the storyline is actually pretty good (although definitely taking a cue from the much better spoof ""Without a Clue"" with Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley), the acting by Edward Woodward as the great Holmes is definitely too over the top; as if making up for this, John Hillerman as Watson plays it down so obviously you almost jump in your seat when he moves an eyebrow.

However, the attention to period details is admirable and Anthony Andrews does not, as does Woodward, overact (well, maybe just a hair). Given the fact that the script was written by Charles Pogue, a well known screenwriter for suspense and thriller movies, this is a disappointing venture into the realm of Sherlock Holmes. In addition, it's pretty obvious the title was chosen in an attempt to hook the viewer; there's absolutely no scene in which hands do any murdering. (Believe me, I'm not giving anything away by saying that).

This TV movie would have been much better if Woodward had not overacted and if the script was given more edge than it has. As it is now, it's a serviceable journeyman work that is OK to watch if you have nothing better lying around. But as mentioned above, ""Without a Clue"" is a real hoot, and for my money, the best Holmes pastiches are Billy Wilder's ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" and Bob Clark's excellent ""Murder by Decree"".

This one's a shade above passable; hence, the three stars.",1200268800,,1510,4.733840304182509

2061423,1,B000244FZU,"Who indeed?  This so-called Sherlock Holmes mystery is, quite possibly, the single worst film I have ever seen in my entire life.  Blandly written, appallingly over- and underacted, and unmemorably directed, ""Hands of a Murderer"" features such ""delights"" as a Watson with no personality whatsoever, a Sherlock who is actually stouter than Mycroft, and a laughable denouement.

I also found strange Moriarty's passionate ""romance"" with his female associate.  Since Moriarty is Holmes' mirror image, so to speak, writers should treat his love interests with the same delicacy they would treat Holmes' -- hinting more than revealing, and involving fascinating, intelligent women, not hammily acted hypnotists.  Most incredible of all, though, is the moment when Watson refers to Holmes as ""Sherlock"" -- something he would never, ever do in any book or film written by anyone who had read the Conan Doyle stories with any attention whatsoever.

Edward Woodward (of whom I still have fond memories as ""The Equalizer"") plays Sherlock Holmes as though the role is a straitjacket pinching him in uncomfortable places, forcing him to walk and talk strangely.

There is one good thing about this film:  it has quadrupled my already vast appreciation for the late, great Jeremy Brett.",1152057600,15,1273,5.298507462686567
2061424,2,B000244FZU,"""Hands of a Murderer"" was the first Sherlock Holmes adaptation I ever saw (though oddly, it was titled ""Sherlock Holmes and the Prince of Crime""). Being around 12 years old at the time, I considered it to be just about the greatest thing ever put on film. Time has jaded me, however, because now I see it as a rather goofy and unimpressive entry. The storyline is decent enough: the evil Professor Moriarty desperately wants to get his hands on a secret code that Holmes' brother Mycroft is protecting. However, it is all carried out with quite a bit of camp. Edward Woodward (Sherlock Holmes) is clearly too old for the role, and, quite frankly, does not much resemble the tall, lean figure of the stories. In addition, he seems to spend much of the film in an oddly grumpy mood, as if he were disturbed from a nap in between takes. John Hillerman's Watson fares little better, delivering his lines in a dreary, sombulent tone. Anthony Andrews (side note: see ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" for a GREAT performance) is the only saving grace, and makes a  believeable Moriarty, though perhaps a touch too young.

Despite its weaknesses, this film is fun to watch on a lazy or rainy afternoon, and is recommended for collectors of Sherlockiana and/or Holmes on screen. Two stars out of five.",1093737600,13,1283,4.697777777777778
2061425,5,B000244FZU,"I had the great good fortune of watching HANDS OF A MURDERER tonight. I saw it about 10 years ago and remembered enjoying it then, but with the release of the DVD I was able to relive it. An exceptional movie with an interesting plot and nicely played characterization. I recommend it and it was interesting to see the 7 percent solution back.

 There was a great line from Hillerman's Watson when he laments that he much preferred the three pint solution to the 7-percent one.

 Holmes is obsessed with the search for Prof. Moriarty who has recently escaped the hangman's noose in cavaliar and spectacular style. Holmes obsession even makes him refuse an initial request for help from his brother Mycroft when national security is at stake. It is only when he senses the diabolical mind of Moriarty in the theft of a secret document from Mycrofts safe that Holmes reconsiders and begins his investigation.

 Woodward is not the best Holmes and Hillerman is not the best Watson but together they make an interesting team and this movie (made by Granada for British television) is intoxicatingly watchable with well drawn out characterization and some enjoyable (if somewhat predictable twists and turns) - just how does Moriarty manage to eliminate someone in police custody??

 This DVD comes well recommended. A treat for every Sherlockian.",1090886400,20,1342,4.959821428571429

8021793,3,B000244FZU,"My library of Sherlok Holmes dvds is quite extensive covering just about every actor who attempted the character . I enjoy them all however divergent from the original they my be . Some are fantastic and very far off and exhibit a mere distant acknowldgement of the original stories , yet with they remain agreable and acceptable , and would , with some imagination , be thought the work of sir Arthur Conan Doyle had he had the inclination to write more . On the other hand some birds are just not meant to fly . This rendition is enjoyable but somewhat misses the mark , unlike a rather modern version which has little to do with sir Arthur  but is more acceptable .",1333065600,,668,4.387096774193548
8021794,1,B000244FZU,"I have watched some trash in my time, but this is about the worst I have ever seen.  Arthur Conan Doyle must be birreling in his grave.

My main disappointment that an actor of the calibre of Edward Woodward should deign to appear in such drivel.  He must have have had a final notice to pay his gas bill!

Anybody who thinks this is good is capable of watching any rubbish and must be easlily pleased, and I would think must be the type who can sit and watch anything.

To say it was embarrassing is understatement.",1315785600,,516,4.278350515463917
8021795,1,B000244FZU,"This movie is essentily a bad remake of many of the Basil Rathbone movies.

This movie rips off several ideas from the Rathbone movies.

here are just a few of the rip offs as follows.

-Moriarty escapes being hanged
 (Adventures of S. H. where Moriarty is aquited of murder)

-Woman hypnotises lord
(The Woman In Green. this movie even reuses the bowl with water and flowers)

and there are others I am sure.

not only does this movie represent the Rathbone storys in a bad way but the plot and story are boring
even the actors seemed bored of what they are doing.

many of the story elements are just plain dull.

holmes pretends to be dead
just to catch Moriarty placing a reath on his suposed grave stone.

If you want Sherlock Holmes watch a good Rathbone movie
or some of Jermey Brett's early Holmes's work.

anything but this!",1221436800,2,833,4.486666666666666
