Here are my full reviews for both films. This set receives four stars for being a 80s horror set.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Child-s-Play/dp/079284131X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Child's Play</a>
When this movie first game on in the late 80s children across the world were petrified of Chucky the doll. The idea that a simple doll could become a murderous monster horrified us all. This idea however fades much as your childhood does. This movie screams 80s horror and is honestly not that scary to begin with. If you are above ten years old, I do not think you will find this one frightening in the least.

The movie opens with a foot chase scene. Charles Lee Ray is being chased the streets by a cop. Ray quickly finds sanctuary in a nearby Mall. In the process, he takes a bullet and begins to die. Realizing this he finds a doll. The doll is from a popular children's television show called the ""Good Guys."" That name becomes very ironic through the course of the movie. Ray begins spewing some voodoo language and lightning suddenly hits the store causing a huge explosion. You are not shown what happened, but I'm sure you already have a guess.

From there the movie switches its focus to a mother and her child, Andy. Andy loves the Good Guys and wants one of the Good Guy dolls badly. His mother gets him one as a late Birthday present. Little does she know that the doll, known as Chucky, will become a crazed maniac looking for revenge on all his enemies. After the mother's best friend is killed in what seems like an accident, Andy is caught in the mix. Andy claims that Chucky did it. However, every one thinks he is crazy. Andy is even considered a suspect in the murder. However, we all know it is Chucky.

This movie uses a ton of great camera angles. It is one of the first things I noticed. You see everything perfectly. When Chucky is running, you have a running view of him through his eyesight. Sometimes you will barely catch him running or a shadow of him. This creates a good amount of suspense for the viewer. In addition, the mixture of CG, Puppets, and the actual doll work very well for the most part. Sometimes the doll will be floating without anyone holding him. Overall though, they do it pretty well.

One tremendous problem with this film is the 80s vibe it has. Gunshots sound horrible, everyone is made to be idiots, and the antagonist just will not die. All the characters in the movie are asinine. The characters just never get the fact that Chucky is killing everyone. They just play the whole ""Andy is crazy"" act and move on. Despite Chucky's footprints and evidence all over the place, they do not believe it. Chucky also suffers from an ""I just won't die"" syndrome that I hate in horror movie. He looks like he is dead and the movie is over, then suddenly he is on the attack at the end. It makes you wonder how they even made a second movie after all the punishment he was dealt in this movie.

Another part of the movie that really hurts it is one scene. A cop is attacked by Chucky in his car and ends up crashing his car. Not just crash either; he flips it over and everything. Somehow, he is perfectly fine without any damage done to him. Another 80s clich is that car crashes were easy to walk away from I guess.

Chucky himself is brought into the movie very well. He does not do much in the beginning of the movie, but is slowly brought in. You do not even seem him truly move until half of the movie is over. This works for me though. It keeps you wanting to know how Chucky looks when he is moving. Chucky is a very crude character and has some funny one-liners. This is why he would move on to do more comedic movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-Chucky/dp/0783232039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of Chucky</a>.

This film is still a classic though. I like the story and idea behind this one. In this day and age it just doesn't hold up well enough to other horror movies. If you are looking for a cheesy movie with an interesting killer, this is for you. If you are looking for a great horror movie to watch, try something else.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling</a>
In an attempt to get back into the Halloween spirit, I decided to watch ""one of the best werewolf movies ever made"" according to the Los Angeles. The Howling is a classic 80s horror film that took werewolf action to a new level. The modern era might look down on this movie due to its out-dated special effects. However, there is a great time to be had with The Howling.

Karen White, a TV newscaster, is on the edge of catching a serial killer named Eddie. She is told to meet Eddie at a local adult shop. She arrives at the shop and enters a theater booth. In the booth, she is assaulted by Eddie. Karen narrowly escapes due to the police arriving just in time. Eddie is shot and assumed dead. Karen is traumatized by the event and has breakdowns just thinking of what happened in the booth. Her doctor suggests taking time off at a secluded retreat known as ""The Colony."" ""The Colony"" is not what it appears to be though. Many hairy secrets are hidden underneath the anomalous characters living in ""The Colony.""

I doubt I am going to spoil the story for anyone when I say that Werewolves are the huge secret. Karen Shaub, a fellow reviewer, asked me not to use the word cheesy in my reviews anymore, so I will try to use other words to describe these furry beasts. The Werewolves epitomize the archetypal 80s style monster. Clearly, you cannot expect&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B0001WTUH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>&nbsp;type visuals from this 80s classic. The Werewolves are frequently men in imaginative Werewolf costumes. The transformations, while detailed, lasted far too long and came off as ridiculous. The Werewolves might have been good for their time, but are nothing compared to some of today's CG marvels.

The acting in this movie is decent. Sometimes you will deal with overacting or under acting. At one point, Karen's best friend is killed. Karen sits in sorrow for less than a second and continues what she is doing. Music works to perfection. Suspense is created with the sound track. Even those who are not usually afraid of 80s horror will find themselves jumping every now and then.

This DVD is a dual-sided disk packed with extras. On the side with the film, you can listen to a commentary track with the director and others. The other side of the disk is jam packed with good extras. There are many making of features. There are also deleted scenes and outtakes. There are trailers and a photo gallery. This pulls The Howling up to a four-star rating. Pick this one up to satisfy you 80s horror craving.",1223856000,4,6980,4.816360601001669
