4572253,4,B00555ZT7Y,"I have not watched this dvd but I wanted all of you who have read the reviews for this, that when Mark Arnold leaves a comment you can take it to the bank. I've known Mark for a while and his love for the classic cartoons is unequaled. He will speak from the heart. The books he has written and continues to write are testimony to this. All of you should check them out as I believe they are on Amazon (shameless plug ). Hey Mark keep leaving reviews on these dvd's as I will look forward to the honest comments, and when you finally see this you owe me lunch.",1317427200,5,560,4.054054054054054
4572254,4,B00555ZT7Y,"I did not participate in this DVD as it was done on the cheap, but worth buying.

They use ""The Harveytoon Show"" versions of H&K and sometimes have a condensed
music opening for each cartoon, but it is not the complete theme song each time,
just an edited version. I don't know the cartoons well enough to know if they
have been edited as well, but they did somehow cram 33 cartoons onto the single
disc set. It features every cartoon from ""Mice Meeting You"" to ""Katnip's Big
Day"" except the one with Buzzy and the ones made prior to 1950. The cover
picture is the same, but repainted and ""The Complete Series"" is in a blue spot.

The end credits appear every fourth cartoon and are generic, not specific to
each individual cartoon. As usual, you have to play the disc to see the contents
as they are not listed on the back. There is no booklet. The run time is listed
at 208 minutes. Overall, not bad if you want all the cartoons in one place, but
kinda chintzy considering they could have gotten Jerry Beck and myself to give
commentaries and historical backgrounds.",1316563200,28,1068,4.4438775510204085
4572255,5,B00555ZT7Y,"I ordered the d.v.d from Amazon and loved it. The Amazon description says 60 minutes but the dvd says 208 minutes. I don't know how long it was but it was alot longer then 60 minutes,  There are 27 cartoons on it. They are clear and clean. There is a PLAY ALL  selection. and I have watched them several time.  And for 5.99 I really got my money's worth!",1315872000,12,354,4.101449275362318
4572256,3,B00555ZT7Y,"HERMAN AND KATNIP: THE COMPLETE SERIES contains 33 cartoons: all of the cartoons the characters appeared in that are part of the Harveytoons package. No credits, no openings/closings, and they'll likely look awful when you play them on your High-Def TV because they weren't mastered for it. One, DRINKS ON THE MOUSE, is censored. I cannot, in good conscience, give the set a five-star rating given these flaws. But actually including every single cartoon in the series (as well as two Katnip solo shorts), considering Classic Media's reputation for ""complete"" in the past, this release was better than anything I was expecting. Anybody who thought they'd be getting better for $6.00 is out of their minds.

The series, while unremarkable, doesn't deserve the flack it gets, especially with the frequent comparisons to its highly regarded predecessor from MGM. True, there are few series as beautifully animated and funny as the original Tom & Jerry of the 1940s, but frankly, Herman & Katnip are at least on the same level as  the 1950s T&Js. They're as well animated and written, and Arnold Stang's excellent voicework as Herman gives them a streetwise edge T&J never had. The violence contained herein is no more 'disturbing' than what's seen in MGM cartoons either. How many times did Tom artlessly get his tail cut off as the scene's payoff or killed for the conclusion of the picture? What makes this brand of mayhem more 'acceptable' than when it happens to Katnip? The difference is nonexistent, frankly, and those arguing otherwise are kidding themselves.

Any fan of classic animation has no excuse _not_ to buy this release. Marty Taras, Famous Studios's greatest and most recognizable animator, is predominantly featured in most of the earliest cartoons, and his drawing, posing, timing, and movement is as good as anyone's. This is likely the only release of these cartoons you'll be getting, so don't think a high-def edition remastered from the Paramount Pictures material is around the corner. Besides, whoever thought we'd _ever_ actually see a legitimate release called HERMAN AND KATNIP: THE COMPLETE SERIES? I sure didn't.",1315612800,24,2141,5.128939828080229
4572257,2,B00555ZT7Y,"I've been periodically checking back on this Herman & Katnip dvd release (Paramount Pictures answer to Tom and Jerry).  I've been looking for a review from some insider who might have seen this disc, but nobody yet.  All I can say is I HOPE the cartoons are uncut, with the beginning/end titles intact.  Complete with the Harveytoons logo, the correct music, and no edits.  The running time for this disc reads 60 min.  How can that be?  The cartoons featuring this cat and mouse team would certainly run past that...like two hours, not one.  So this causes me great concern.  I bought the Harveytoons boxed set years ago from Sony, and these classic toons were chopped to pieces.  Why doesn't Classic Media respect these cartoons?  Well who knows maybe this set will be different.  Surprise us classic animation fans Classic Media!  Please don't disappoint us...again. UPDATE! the cartoons, as I previously mentioned, are edited.  That said, the original Herman & Katnip theme song ""Skiddle, diddle dee, skitddle diddle day, it's just like a holiday,"" is also missing from each toon.  But you can hear snippets of it in NORTHWEST MOUSIE,"" near the end.  Herman the mouse himself sings it in SURF AND SOUND.  My favorite is OF MICE AND MAGIC. with the cat and mouse battling it out in a magician's atmosphere. Magic does abound, especially at the end!  As usual, Winston Sharples gives a great score to each and every 'toon. He wasn't as well regarded as Scott Bradley at MGM, or Carl Stalling as Warner Bros., but his musical pieces are excellent. I believe thee are 33 cartoons on this disc for a running time of 3 hours, 25 min.  Arnold Stang provides the voice of Herman.  Stang went on to even further glory as ""Top Cat,"" in 1962.  For some odd reason he doesn't provide the voice of Herman in the final Herman/Katnip vehicle, KATNIP'S BIG DAY, from 1959.  Guess he was gone by then.  That cartoon, a this-is-your life-type  story, has all the characters, or rather his on-screen co-stars ribbing Katnip about various high-jinks.  Footage is shown from various cartoons.  Herman, and even Buzzy the crow are on hand.  Interesting and pleasing.  It does provide the complete series of the NO. 2 cat and mouse team of the fifties (7 time Oscar winners Tom and Jerry were No. 1), and the episodes are indeed enjoyable and fun to watch!",1312588800,11,2337,4.734491315136476

4572259,5,B00555ZT7Y,"The cartoons are in good shape and I believe are complete for these two.  I love the golden age and even if H&K are not the cream of the crop, I don't care.  I want to have a good collection of as many golden age cartoons as I can afford.",1387843200,,238,3.74

4572263,4,B00555ZT7Y,"I've read a few reviews on here knocking this set. What do people expect out of a 6 dollar dvd containing a complete series???

1) Beck might not have the legal ability to do anymore than he did as far as the edits.

2) Beck may have wanted too much money for his commentaries and backgrounds.

3) Sometimes the publishing company(ies) change the theme songs because they cannot get permission to use the original(s) and other times because the person(s)/company(ies) who own(s) the rights to the theme songs want(s) too much money for usage.

Let's face it for the price charged for this set how can you complain??? Again we are talking about a 6 dollar set here.

I am pleased with what I received. I couldn't and didn't expect any more for 6 bucks. I laughed my head off and relived some wonderful childhood experiences.

Cheers",1351728000,8,831,4.619047619047619
4572264,5,B00555ZT7Y,this cartoon takes you back to the innocent dayzzz.  I loved it!!  Well packaged and brand new.  The colors and sound are perfect.  I used to watch this and it's the same.  My daughter is 10 yrs old and it's a good cartoon instead of the violence they show now days.,1333929600,,266,4.137254901960785
4572265,4,B00555ZT7Y,"Well, the cartoons look fine, but couldn't they have done some finaggling (?) to include the original openings? Hearing the ""When Katnip The Cat, Meets Herman The Mouse, Katnip The Cat, Packs His Bags & Leaves The House"" really MADE the cartoon!...but it's not here. Also believe it's basically the same as the DVD ""Herman & Catnip & Friends"". Neither had the song. Still enjoyable, though...just not as much as it could have been.
