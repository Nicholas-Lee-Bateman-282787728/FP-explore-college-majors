6185081,5,B00HNGC5HU,"One of the best seasons from this amazing series! 4 rangers switch in the middle of it but its still great, whether with Kat, Tanya, Justin, Adam and Tommy or Cassie, Ashley, Justin, Carlos and TJ :D",1432080000,,199,4.405405405405405
6185082,5,B00HNGC5HU,I've been dying to get my hands on this and I will continue to support Power Rangers. This never fails to put a smile on my face.,1419984000,,129,3.814814814814815
6185083,5,B00HNGC5HU,after defeating divatox who by now swears revenge the rangers prepare for a new journey in their lives as graduation was one thing but taking on a new villain who they thought would have given up is a new journey within its own rights. will they stop divatox? watch and find out,1409961600,,278,4.365384615384615
6185084,5,B00HNGC5HU,"Item came BEFORE expected delivery date which is a total plus! I ordered item brand new, great to watch episodes from growing up. Three discs in this volume, good buy.",1407974400,,167,4.6
6185085,4,B00HNGC5HU,"This is a good season as far as power rangers go, its probably the most comedic season as far as Saban is concerned, Its a good buy, especially if you don't plan on watching every season of PR, I have bought all the single sets up to the turbo set because I have no interest of watching any of Space, LG or LR.

So if you wanna watch every season then skip it, but if you are like me and just want specific seasons, these are perfect.",1390694400,,434,3.9885057471264367
6185086,3,B00HNGC5HU,"Okay as a long time PR fan I watched this when I was a kid back in 1997. Then I re-watched it now as an adult and it's . . . still not the greatest series. But if you're a fan of Power Rangers, or if you like PR to have a little more comedy to it then this is for you. I'm not sure how many episodes are on the set since there's 45 total in the season, I don't know where it would exactly cut off. I would assume it's the first 23 episodes.

Not the greatest season of Power Rangers, but maybe worth checking out",1389139200,,512,3.740740740740741

8633732,4,B00HNGC5HU,"""Power Rangers: Turbo, Vol. 1"" picks up following the events of ""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie."" In the three-part season opener, ""Shift Into Turbo,"" the Rangers graduate from high school (which means Tommy was supposed to be 14 when he first became the Green Ranger in MMPR) while Zordon and Alpha-5 return to Eltar. Rocky also makes his last appearance when the Rangers tell him about the adventures from the film and he gives Justin his blessing to become the new Blue Ranger. At the same time, Bulk and Skull are turned into chimpanzees. The Rangers new mentor, Dimitria, works with Alpha-6 to help the Rangers in their fight against space pirate Divatox and her Piranhatrons.
Standout episodes in this season include ""The Millennium Message,"" which introduces the Blue Senturion, a robotic police officer from the year 2000 sent back in time to warn the Rangers and Dimitria against an evil team-up. ""Honey, I Shrunk the Rangers"" is a fun two-part episode in which the Rangers shrink to action figure size and travel through Divatox's ship. In the two-part ""Passing the Torch,"" Tommy, Adam, Kat, and Tanya transfer their powers to new Rangers T.J., Carlos, Cassie, and Ashley, respectively. With the departure of Tommy, Adam, and Kat, the series no longer has any Rangers left from the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers seasons. Tanya took the place of Aisha the Yellow Ranger in ""Power Rangers: Zeo"" and thus served to link MMPR with that season. Finally, ""Phantom Phenomenon"" introduces the Phantom Ranger, a soldier from Zordon's home planet of Eltar.
This season was particularly high-concept as it followed a motion picture ""pilot."" It changed a great deal of the mythology, with Divatox sending monsters to place explosives rather than directly attack the Rangers. Bulk and Skull continue to be entertaining, though their transformation into chimpanzees combined with the inclusion of a young kid as the Blue Ranger exemplifies the old adage of working with children and animals. Justin is not as annoying as I recalled watching this when I was young, but the stories about him can't help but feel forced to work in the other Rangers. Overall, the weakest part of this season is the loss of the final Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, which alienated long-time fans. That said, the new cast is really great and revitalizes the series after four years.",1505088000,,2354,5.00765306122449
