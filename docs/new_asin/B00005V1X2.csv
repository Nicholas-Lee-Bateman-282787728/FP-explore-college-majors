7955824,3,B00005V1X2,"I think the DVD releases of the shows could have been better.  As mentioned in other review the first few minutes of the episodes are missing which leaves you lacking an introduction into what is going on.  The DVD plays much like a movie and is not interupted with the beginning credits.  Still, the first segments of the episodes would have been nice to have.  This DVD includes episodes 7-9 titled 'Bullies,' 'Tought Break,' and 'The Rock.'",1273190400,,443,4.714285714285714

7955826,5,B00005V1X2,I have been trying to ration the Jackie Chan DVDs since it is no longer available on Saturday morning but I am sure that I will be more than satisfied!!!!,1123545600,,154,4.166666666666667
7955827,3,B00005V1X2,"(...) Having taped Jackie Chan Adventures on both Kids WB! and Cartoon Network, and having recently purchased all three JCA DVDs used (never pay retail!) I can WITHOUT A DOUBT say that these episodes are intact. Much like Cartoon Network does, this DVD plays the opening credits, the show, the ending credits. Kids WB! plays approx. 90 sec. of the episode (the intro), then the opening credits, then the rest of the show, and then the ending credits. For example in the first episode on the first DVD, the opening theme/credits are played, then the 90 sec. intro which takes place in the castle (it is this part which Kids WB! would play before the opening credits, then the scene changes to Uncle's shop and the rest of the episode continues. Where these DVDs really deviate is by playing one opening credit, all three episodes in ""movie format"", then all three ""Ask Jackie"" spots and finally a combined ending credits. Strangely, though they use the opening theme music during the end credits as adopted in later seasons NOT the ""Chan is the Man"" song originally used.
(...).
All JCA episodes on these DVDs are intact, though why Columbia/Tri-Star (Sony distributes the show, but not the DVDs) chose to go with the ""movie format"" instead of just a straight-forward Episode 1, Episode 2, etc. and then stopped making the DVDs with Episode 9 is beyond me. I would like to see a Season One, Season Two, Season Three, and Season Four box set (especially since JCA has been picked up for a fifth season), hence my only giving these DVDs three stars each.",1083542400,15,1551,4.705882352941177
7955828,4,B00005V1X2,"Jackie Chan Adventures is now on dvd. what will they think of next? this dvd is okay but they should have specail featrues like how the show was made and how it began. to my point of view they shouldn't make a dvd without some type of special features, thats what makes dvd,s exciting for people to watch and to learn about the movie. The movie it self is real good, it's just like on tv without the comercials. In this episode shendu escapes jackie and the team have to stop him.",1062720000,,480,4.228260869565218
7955829,1,B00005V1X2,I would also like to add my expression of disappointment with the omission of the teasers. Leaving out the trailers really detracts from getting into the story. I expected better from a Sony product.,1019433600,,199,4.882352941176471
