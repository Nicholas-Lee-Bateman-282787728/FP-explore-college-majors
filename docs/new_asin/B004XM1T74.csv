8447144,5,B004XM1T74,"Obviously this is a very sympathetic production to Henry Wallace's Political positions but is well done.  It takes the the position that if Wallace had become President, the New Deal programs would have expanded domestically (Government Health Care Systems in the 1940's rather than the 21st century) and internationally a desire for peace and democracy throughout the world.  If infers that had Wallace been president the CIA and the Military Industrial Complex would have never gained so much power as in the Truman and Eisenhowr years.  While idealistic it did outline goals for the US domestic and foreign policy as envisioned by the ""Era of the Common Man' rather than ""America's Century.""",1426636800,2,694,5.178571428571429
8447145,5,B004XM1T74,"Henry A. Wallace was more of a progressive politician than Franklin D. Roosevelt ever was, Wallace's personal ways of life were even ahead of their time he did not eat meat, he did not drink alcohol, and he did not indulge in any kind of tobacco products, he also enjoyed sports especially baseball and boxing he kept himself physically fit, he was not a Washington insider, he was not much interested in the backroom deal making atmosphere in Washington D.C. Henry A. Wallace gave speeches on progressive issues, an end to racial segregation, equal rights for women, he compared Senator McCarthy's communist hearings to the Salem witch hunts, he spoke about better international relations with foreign countries like Russia, China, and Latin America. Wallace also spoke about the U.S. investing money in jobs outside of the military industrial complex, he was a strong supporter of the United Nations. Henry A. Wallace was the original twentieth century progressive liberal politician I only wish that F.D.R . would of had the inner courage and fortitude to keep Wallace on board as his Vice President during F.D.R.'s last term in office before he died, this world and the U.S. today would definitely be a more peaceful civilized and better place to live in if Henry A. Wallace could of became the U.S. President after the death of F.D.R., if you don't know who this great man Henry A. Wallace is then you need to go to amazon.com and buy this DVD.",1422057600,5,1449,4.846774193548387
8447146,5,B004XM1T74,"A video overview of Henry A. Wallace, at heart, a farmer who identified with the common farmer. His innovations and ideas were breathtaking. He was an idealist who inspired respect and admiration of millions. The video is a most excellent addition to reading biographies about H.A Wallace. American Dreamer by John C. Culver who appears in the video and John Hyde and Thomas W. Devine's book on Wallace's 1948 campaign where Wallace's own selfless idealism and decency blinded him to the Machiavellian machinations of Soviet Communists. We owe Henry A. Wallace a debt and his life, the successes and failures, a useful lesson for an American. This is an American story.",1416355200,4,669,5.036036036036036
8447147,5,B004XM1T74,"Machiavelli wrote that a wise man recognizes ills at their inception, but that this gift was given to few.  Although you might not learn it from this video, Henry A. Wallace recognized the dangers of creeping fascism in the USA in the post-WW2 USA.  Now that it is eating, or has already eaten the media, the executive and legislative branches, the military and our department of state, Americans should look back at our history, find out where we went wrong, and then make appropriate corrections.  This video is a wonderful aid to that process. Henry Wallace typifies not just the proverbial ""better angels of our nature"" but the best angels of our National nature.  He was so very right on so many issues that we should be as interested in him as Albert Einstein was interested in Isaac Newton.  What a dreadful sign that our nation once had public servants like Henry A. Wallace, but now hands power to men who either have no principles or men who are willing to sell them to the highest bidder. In fact, in the USA today, every jot and tittle of law or policy is seemingly for sale to the highest bidder.  May the pendulum swing back the other way for a 1/4 period and then stop.",1348963200,20,1184,4.509345794392523
8447148,5,B004XM1T74,"I can merely say that Henry Wallace was an absolute genius, a man, whose deeds were greater than I can begin to describe. If you are at all interested in FDR, the time, US history, anything like this, you should buy this DVD. Wallace was one of the greatest men of the 20th century.

This is a refutation of any slanders against Wallace.",1338681600,19,337,4.349206349206349
