3000578,5,B000XCZGY0,This is such a great series. It flows well off of season 2.  I still can not imagine how this was ever pulled from TV or Showtime.  The acting is superb and by this time I am beginning to feel as if I know these characters personally.  The relationship among the three sisters is awsome and takes me way back.  I love this show and I am so thankful for the recordings of the series.  I have already ordered the final season.  Simply the best !,1313798400,,443,4.093023255813954

3000587,5,B000XCZGY0,"Season one was out for a long while and 2-5 was unavailable, then season two was available to be rented. So after I purchased season one, I was angry because Sony would not release the Series for sale.  Then after about another year - Seasons three through the finale were available and I watched them all after purchasing the product and it was soothing and wonderful to see that life can have a wonderful ending even on television in the 21st century.  The Soul food series was phenomenal and the positivity of a complex black family with its highs and lows made it through with the right understanding of family being the most important component in life. The acting was great and the ending brought closure to the long waiting period for me and it was well worth the wait. Hats off to Nicole and Boris, it was exciting to see a real life relationship evolve and blossom.  I pray it always is their focus to determine to truly have a happy ending, by choosing to stay connected through it all. Blessings to all the contributors and those who made a difference in the image of life as it relates to people simply being people.",1246147200,3,1128,4.492682926829269

I am at the end of the third season and will be purchasing season 4 at the end of this week.  I have fallen in love with this family, and am sad to see my realtionship with them (friends in my head) come to an end.  I wish there were more seasons because one by one I'd buy them all.  We need more shows like this one.  This show made me change a few things in my life.  They make me want to do better.

3000596,5,B000XCZGY0,This entire series is definitely worth purchasing.  These episodes are classic and the series was contemporary but in many respects slightly ahead of its time.

It was great to be able to pick up where I left of at the end of Season II. The shows are so heart warming, real and most of all, relatable. My only concern is the distribution of this product. Why is it taking so extremely long for each dvd to come out. I believe that the families shown on this series are great, positvie role models that need to be seen by the world..... so why keep that from us?",1206748800,,575,3.923076923076923
3000601,4,B000XCZGY0,I for one loved this season. I thought it was racy sexy and not to mention funny but Damon just changed right before my eyes from a romantic sweetheart to a total a__hole. I can't believe him. I just can't wait to see what is next,1206144000,,230,4.021739130434782

3000607,5,B000XCZGY0,"I have been a Soulfood fan from the start, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. The episodes come so close to home for a lot of people. It's like even though families fuss and sometimes fight, they still love eachother. That's how we do!",1204243200,,244,4.326086956521739

3000610,5,B000XCZGY0,"I am a Soulfood finatic.  I have all three seasons and yes, season 3 is no my favorite; however it is far better than many television shows today.  I choose to watch it over anything else.  The editing did not drive me crazy and after watching the disc set only once I noticed the song was different for Lem's birthday party.  Unfortunately, it has been a while since I have seen the unedited versions.  Over all,  I am pleased it was released.  I await the following seasons or season however they plan to do it.  Go out an by it to judge for yourself loyal fans will appreciate the dvd.",1203984000,,588,4.281818181818182
3000611,2,B000XCZGY0,"this is the worst season of soul food by far. damon is haunted by his ex-girlfriend? bird gets the hots for her female colleague? lem hooks up with baron marks and learns that shade can go corporate as well as street?terrence howard is the only thing that saves these discs from closet purgatory. his portrayal of baller benny jones was enough to shake me out of a persistent doze-fest. this is also the worst TV show-to-DVD release by far. i agree with l. williams -- the editing will drive you crazy! why did paramount do this? how can they justify it? makes me wish i had taped the episodes when they aired... but even showtime displayed an evil sense of humor when they played repeats -- they mixed up the order, so if you were trying to create an at-home collection for yourself, it would have been all wrong. i'm crying foul.",1202774400,,831,4.473684210526316
3000612,2,B000XCZGY0,"I am very disappointed in Paramount/CBS. This series was originally advertised as ""The Complete Third Season"" which like the ""The Complete First Season"" was supposed to be made up of the ORIGINAL (unedited) shows. However, within the last few days the advertisements have quietly been changed to illustrate...""Soul Food-The Third Season."" SOUL FOOD FANS BEWARE, it appears we are going to get chopped, edited, cut up versions of the original shows with different scenes, music, words, etc. I AM VERY UPSET. I fell in love with the ""original"" versions of these shows and that is what I'd like to see. I am not sure I will purchase this ""third season."" I think the studios are misguided in ""cheating"" Soul Food fans out of enjoying the original shows in its entirety (unedited). I was disappointed in quality of the some episodes of the second season because of the OBVIOUS editing. I wish the distributors would just release the series in it's original form and let us edit it at home IF that's what we want.",1201219200,42,1007,4.793103448275862

3235075,5,B000XCZGY0,This is such a great series. It flows well off of season 2.  I still can not imagine how this was ever pulled from TV or Showtime.  The acting is superb and by this time I am beginning to feel as if I know these characters personally.  The relationship among the three sisters is awsome and takes me way back.  I love this show and I am so thankful for the recordings of the series.  I have already ordered the final season.  Simply the best !,1313798400,,443,4.093023255813954

So after I purchased season one, I was angry because Sony would not release the Series for sale.  Then after about another year - Seasons three through the finale were available and I watched them all after purchasing the product and it was soothing and wonderful to see that life can have a wonderful ending even on television in the 21st century.  The Soul food series was phenomenal and the positivity of a complex black family with its highs and lows made it through with the right understanding of family being the most important component in life. The acting was great and the ending brought closure to the long waiting period for me and it was well worth the wait. Hats off to Nicole and Boris, it was exciting to see a real life relationship evolve and blossom.  I pray it always is their focus to determine to truly have a happy ending, by choosing to stay connected through it all.

This series was originally advertised as ""The Complete Third Season"" which like the ""The Complete First Season"" was supposed to be made up of the ORIGINAL (unedited) shows. However, within the last few days the advertisements have quietly been changed to illustrate...""Soul Food-The Third Season."" SOUL FOOD FANS BEWARE, it appears we are going to get chopped, edited, cut up versions of the original shows with different scenes, music, words, etc. I AM VERY UPSET. I fell in love with the ""original"" versions of these shows and that is what I'd like to see. I am not sure I will purchase this ""third season."" I think the studios are misguided in ""cheating"" Soul Food fans out of enjoying the original shows in its entirety (unedited). I was disappointed in quality of the some episodes of the second season because of the OBVIOUS editing. I wish the distributors would just release the series in it's original form and let us edit it at home IF that's what we want.",1201219200,42,1007,4.793103448275862
