7923528,1,B00004U3UV,"Being a fan of Jack Long and Mark Long I took a risk and bought this.  Well, they're in it but not like you'd expect.  Hiding inside the sleeve featuring a scene from Mystery of Chess Boxing touting the appearance of Mark ""Ghost Faced Killer"" Long is one of those hopping Chinese vampire movies, so if you're at all interested in seeing some neat kung fu just forget this movie.  The plot is that a cute vampire kid gets picked on by some priests and cries for his parents.  A young girl and her young friend try to help him while their grandparents, one played by Jack Long and the other played by Mark Long, try to slap pieces of paper to the vampire's faces.  Which paralyzes them or something I guess, I've never tried it.  The King of Evil also makes his presence known, along with his nemesis the flying woman with a sword.  Actually there are a good amount of fights, the problem is that they are all against vampires who can only swipe wildy with both arms extended.  Go ahead and watch it but you've been warned.",984960000,,1021,4.336842105263158
7923529,2,B00004U3UV,"This should have never been released in the chessboxing collection.  It is a fantsy filled story, with power ranger like attributes.  Mark long and Jack long were in the movie for short periods, if that was even them, and they didnt' even face off. a dull, repetative film, that i wouldn't really recomend to any one over the age of 10.",972604800,,336,4.491803278688525
