7907945,5,B00000F88P,"The best source I've seen in presenting what it means to have gender conflicts. This documentary shows a wide variety of aspects of gender conflict, from those who elect surgery to those who suffer in silence. IF viewers WANT to understand this conundrum, this documentary explains and shows what they need to learn. Full understanding of ""why?"" still wafts in the wind, but the FACT of gender conflict is far wider than our society may realize and begins at a very young age. It would be great if this source was available, since it is classic and would help people understand Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner's choice today. It's pretty much not what you might think.",1445990400,,657,4.823008849557522
7907946,5,B00000F88P,"It's been 30 years since this was released on HBO's America Undercover series.  I saw it, and copied it, when it was shown.  Something odd I found out many years later was the two male-to-female transsexuals at the beginning were not actually the people being presented.  The topless dancer's real name was Veronica York, not 'Kathy', and 'Mary' was actually someone named Renee Williams.  I do believe it is true 'Kathy' was a topless dancer, but not at the club shown in this doc.  This was a gay club called The Copa that was used for this purpose, so allegedly not to blow 'Kathy's' cover at the real gentlemen's club she worked at.

It would be so interesting to learn updates on the many people involved in this doc.  I know that some have now passed.  'Kathy' and 'Mary' are two that have since died, and so did the female-to-male Dan, the construction worker.  I'm not sure about the others.  Jody was older so likely she has passed also.  I know that famed transsexual, Christine Jorgensen died back in 1989.

This was the first documentary I had ever seen about transsexuals and transvestites - and one of the best - and it does have that 1980's Phil Donahue social commentary about it.  A great doc.  I give it 5 STARS!",1271721600,,1230,4.531818181818182
7907947,5,B00000F88P,"Produced years before the publication of J. Michael Bailey's extraordinary book The Man Who Would Be Queen, What Sex Am I? is a valuable depiction of transsexuality. In fact, the film is a vivid illustration of the two kinds of transsexuality clinically investigated by another pioneer, Dr. Raymond Blanchard. I urge anyone interested in transsexuality to view this film, but only after reading Bailey's book.  You will see that the film portrays the complicated lives of transsexuals---and illustrates the major ""types"" of transsexuality.  My only wish: a more explicit discussion of autogynephilia and homosexual transsexuality.

The film was years ahead of its time.",1150848000,5,669,5.475728155339806
