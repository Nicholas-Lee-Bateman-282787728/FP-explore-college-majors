I can't believe it has so many positive reviews---considering the reviewers all either a)share the same last name as the teenager who wrote/directed/starred in this movie and 2)live in or around Los Angeles, CA....it seems like these are people Anne-Sophie knows who are inflating the positive ratings on purpose to sell this movie.  This movie was written/directed/starred in by a 16 year old girl. In all ways this movie looks and feels like a bad teenage novella.  The acting is terrible, the movie is boring, it is a low budget high school project.  I have no idea who backed the funding for this movie, probably the girl's own family.  If you are dying to see this movie I suggest you rent it first.  It's a real snoozer...don't waste your $$.",1277078400,,773,4.731343283582089
8352980,5,B0026LQM4E,"I picked up this movie with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised with the broad influx of dynamic story telling, powerful cinematography all tied together with a solid ending...

When I read a little more about the film and found out it was directed by a 16-year-old girl, I was taken back... Two words: child savant...

I would recommended anyone with a love for movies to pick this one up...",1255651200,,401,4.714285714285714
8352981,4,B0026LQM4E,"So here is the review:
An inspiring movie from a very young filmmaker. This story grows on you as it's hard to figure out what's going on initially, but everything begins to pay off and the love story really moved me. I find it quite amazing that such a young girl managed to direct and star in this movie, but surprisingly, I soon forgot about who made it as I gradually got more involved in the story and the main character's plight. Everything moves forward pretty briskly initially, and while some of the acting is sometimes a little uneven, the third act was a real tear jerker. Highly recommended.",1254441600,,603,4.541284403669724
8352982,5,B0026LQM4E,"Much has been said about Anne-Sophie Dutoit, the teen director, who was only 16 when she wrote, directed and starred in this movie. What impresses most is the strong vision this very young director brings to this family drama that gradually involves you more and more into the life of the protagonist, Cassandra, and her lover, Lucas as their life is shattered by family feud and events.

If I may venture to find a comparison -- I would say that this movie is a cross between Girl, Interrupted and The Notebook with a Memento twist, albeit on a lower independent film budget, and it's easy to understand how teen girls will relate to the storyline that was conceived and written by someone their age. I suspect that the Twilight crowd may find something to love in this storyline too.

I think that a lot of adults will enjoy this movie too as it reveals the awkwardness and unease of one's first love story through some very nice cinematography, sharp editing, sweeping music and a strong cast that is sure to move and touch one's heart in unexpected ways. As seen from the eyes of young writer-director wunderkind, this movie is a unique and unexpected experience that I highly recommend.",1253836800,,1191,4.69377990430622
8352983,5,B0026LQM4E,"A friend in Canada recommended this film to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a pretty unique movie that doesn't follow any set Hollywood formula and it delivers plenty of drama. I loved the relationship between Cassandra and Lucas and how they're torn between their families in the tradition of Romeo and Juliet. But I just can't pin down what makes this movie work because it's unlike any other love story I have seen before. I had read about the director, Anne-Sophie Dutoit, in an L.A. Times article and have been waiting to watch her work ever since. She will acquire more maturity and poise as a filmmaker as she grows older, but this first film is very impressive indeed.",1253664000,,681,4.636363636363637
8352984,5,B0026LQM4E,"""Faded Memories is a wonderful film that appeals to people of all ages. It is astonishing that it is written and directed by a very talented 16-year old! And, by the way, this 16-year old also stars in the film and is a convincing, natural actress. The cast is strong and believable. The story is honest, thought provoking and real. Anne-Sophie's film-making career is off to a terrific start."" (Jeff W., Los Angeles)

""Every frame of Anne-Sophie Dutoits marvelous and memorable film rings true. Spot on for the age we live in, as well as the age of the characters. This is not a film locked into a single genre, or just one thought--even as life itself is far more complicated than that. Astonishing maturity is evident in Anne-Sophies script! But the real surprise is the perfect pacing of this sui generis film, and the flawless and seemless performance by a wonderful cast. Anne-Sophie Dutoits performance as Cassandra is richly layered. So easy to place oneself in Cassandras shoes because we have all suffered wounds in our youth.

The mark of great movies is whether or not the character arcs ring true. Faded Memories does not hit a false note. The love story inspires, even as chaos engulfs Lucas and Cassandra--each surrounded by untenable problems at home--Cassandras off kilter aunt, Lucas dying father and financially desperate mother. A refreshing and unexpected lagniappe comes the viewers way courtesy of the lavish cinematography. Faded Memories is more than just a noteworthy debut film, it is an instant classic. Years from now, movie fans will look back on Faded Memories the way we remember Lords of Flatbush. A film that spawns a passel of stars--Anne-Sophie Dutoit, Brock Vincent Kelly, Ely Pouget and more."" (V. Smith, Oregon)

""At 16, Anne-Sophie is an AMAZING actress/writer/director/producer... I can't wait to see her work at age 26, 36, 46, or even next week. She is truly a film-making force to respect."" (David P., Los Angeles)

""I found the story to be both engaging and compelling and the performances were impressive. I thought the love story was believable and I liked the unconventional structure of the narrative (the past and present sequences were effectively interwoven.) It has a handsome look and the production quality is good."" (Emily M., Los Angeles)

""Faded Memories is a film deeply rooted with emotion and complexity. Each character has a story within themselves that brings the full story to life with love, danger and ultimately, the freedom of one's self. Cassandra is a lost soul trying to find herself in the world but feels like no one can truly understand her. The character has so many layers of emotion which are portrayed throughout the film so strongly that the audience is able to connect themselves to her and feel her every emotion. Faded Memories is like no other film I have seen. On the outside, it seems very simple and precise, however on the inside in the story itself, the complexity of it is extremely intriguing and beautiful to watch"". (Nicole C., 17, Toronto)

""Anne-Sophie is a phenomenon. Her performance denotes a disarming maturity and depth. If you are interested in watching the first movie of potentially one of the next best director of our generation, watch Faded Memories. In her movie, Anne-Sophie gracefully juggles lightness and profound transformation. She is unequivocally a very promising talent to follow closely."" (Marie-Josee C., Montreal)

"" A breakthrough insightful film depicting how true love can break all barriers. I truly loved this film and its idea in its entirety. Rarely do I go see movies twice, but this one was the exception. Anne-Sophie truly expressed her character and made her world ours. As someone who is a true movie buff, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who could appreciate a great story line with innovative characters."" (Sol R., Los Angeles)

""Dear young Sophie,

Your movie was a breath of fresh air. Confusing at times, present, future and past intersecting thorough out. Some of it looked like the creation of a troubled imaginative young girl, and I almost expected it to be a true story. The search for real love and stability by the aunt collide with the look for financial stability by the boyfriend's mom and created a tragic collusion. I think the love story, was more about love & hate. There was something very young, naive, yet troubled about the movie, and it made me switch sides, between anger but also sympathy towards the worry mom because I am a mom, and sympathy towards the young couple because of my faded memories of my own teenage love stories."" (Nava S., Los Angeles)

""This is a movie that was very insightful, a touching yet dramatic story, intriguing, a story that drew the audience in revealing something new as the story evolved. Realistic and tasteful cinema, time well spent."" (Neil S., Los Angeles)

""The story of Faded Memories has a very good conflict and plot. This movie is a very sad drama, it made me cry and I would rate Faded Memories an A!"" (Tara, 12, Culver City, CA)

""Anne-Sophie is an extremely talented young director; her sense of relationship between the essence of youth and nature is uncanny; I love the way she has conveyed young love as associated with water - the waves at the beach, the stillness of the lake, the joi de vivre of a water balloon fight, the cleansing glee of the rain. All of these scenes are my favorites. The casting was also excellent - all very talented actors ably crafting their characters to support the progressive angst of the young girl. Anne-Sophie's portrayal of a ""girl gone mad"" is very believable, and her scenes with her co-star, Lucas, are tender, innocent and awkward, as well they should be. I am looking forward to Anne-Sophie's next film. Considering all of the talent she has applied to the making of Faded Memories, it is certain to be another remarkable work of cinematic art."" (Jane L., Los Angeles)

""I have seen this film in Los Angeles, It's the most impressive feature film I have ever seen from someone that was 16 years old. I don't know if she understands how inspiring she is and how the passion she has towards her dreams effect and rub off on those around her. She has been an inspiration in my life, and will continue to inspire others."" (Michael C., Los Angeles)

""I really enjoyed the screening of your movie. As you know, I was the first publisher in Germany who printed a fantasy book series from a 13 year-old-girl. So it was only a matter of time, that a young girl like you wrote, directed and played in a movie from her own generation. Who else would be able to reflect problems youngsters face better than themselves, as the view of the next generation is quite different. I was in the movie business myself many years before I became a publisher. As I saw your movie, I compared it with the likes of ""Thelma and Louse"" and I believe your movie can appeal to a wide audience and become a cult hit."" (Kurt. S., Germany)

""With Anne-Sophie's excellent writing, this film really brings out the depth and true emotion of love. And it really means something. This is a movie that can't be missed."" (Lillian, 11, Los Angeles)

""It is my pleasure to congratulate you on the expert craftsmanship and fine work that came together to produce a delicate, engrossing, and moving film, Faded Memories. To comprehend the idea that Anne-Sophie, a talented actor-writer-director, wrote this film at fourteen, and then directed and starred in it at sixteen, is a major achievement even for A-list Hollywood heavyweights such as Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Kevin Costner.  The only woman who comes close to that is Barbara Streisand who has a track-record of credible and successful films that she has starred in, directed, and produced.  Which goes to show, that this talented newcomer is already approaching the big leagues.

I'm sure that she has a great and long career ahead of her. I have seen Faded Memories several times, and in my opinion, having worked in the film industry for many years, I can't think of an acting-writing-directing debut of a young woman or man that comes close to this, other than Tatum O'Neal winning the best supporting actress Oscar for Paper Moon at ten years old!  And that was just for acting!

Faded Memories expertly brings you into the sad and lonely world of teenager Cassandra (played by Anne-Sophie), as she goes through her journey to healing and wholeness.  Along the way, she has to confront and triumph over a demeaning and deceitful guardian Aunt Maggie Mae, and when she falls in love with a young man, Lucas, they find themselves having to battle the forces of an outside society that does not want to see their love fully realized.  It is a beautiful, character-driven drama.

The character arc that Anne-Sophie's Cassandra travels through over the turbulent landscape of this dramatic love story, is wonderfully assisted by a seasoned and talented cast of both gifted newcomers and old pros as well. The end result is a completely compelling and satisfying movie of redemption and love--part mystery, part love story, but in the end a wonderful tale of intrigue and healing as told by talented newcomer, actor-writer-director Anne-Sophie Dutoit.""
