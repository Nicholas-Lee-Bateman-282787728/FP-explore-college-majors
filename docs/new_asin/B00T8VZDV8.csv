8700978,1,B00T8VZDV8,I intended to order the CD with actual exercises and this is only a copy of the TV Broadcast for public broadcasting.,1500768000,7,117,4.363636363636363
8700979,1,B00T8VZDV8,"I was so excited when this DVD arrived in the mail today ( I did not order it from Amazon), but am leaving a review here as a BUYER BEWARE. I watched the first half, which was all talking, then changed into my work out clothes, ready to exercise in the part 2 section. NO, it was more talking. More talking about how wonderful and helpful her exercises are, how great you will look and feel, but NOT ONE SINGLE exercise! You are basically paying for an infomercial. If you want to watch about exercise, then this is the DVD for you, but if you are ready to DO exercise this is USELESS. I am pretty upset with Miranda's marketing of this DVD, as it seems to me it was deceptive, and made to make you think it was an exercise video. Either way, I was mislead and feel ripped off.",1497398400,25,777,4.152317880794702

8700982,5,B00T8VZDV8,"This is a mind-blowing presentation with very recent studies and  information on the effects of exercise on aging that you can't find elsewhere, and which might change your life -- no matter what your age!  (It is information -- not exercises.)  Great info on muscle atrophy (deterioration), such as lack of activity due to injury or surgery, or just plain too much sitting, and an explanation of the rate of muscle atrophy due to aging as well as a chart showing how much exercise can slow down the rate, complete with graphs!  And this is just a sample of the extremely valuable information on this DVD.  I got one through public TV, and now have purchased another as I am sharing it with a number of others. And, -- her website has a bunch of short videos with exercises targeted to specific body or muscle types, (FREE!); just click on ""videos"".  I'm 82, disabled with several chronic conditions caused by a rare cancer, and I've done a lot of research on exercise.  This information is priceless.",1450656000,38,1001,4.653409090909091
8700983,1,B00T8VZDV8,This was an infomercial. No instruction in technique. Very disappointing,1447891200,46,72,6.3
