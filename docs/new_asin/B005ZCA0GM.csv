Each one fell apart and now the dvd's are flopping around in the cases. These are suppose to be new? Very trashy!!!

4908043,5,B005ZCA0GM,"My daughter got me hooked on this series. As each season goes by, the shows get tougher to take. I know nothing about motor cycle gangs so this has been a real experience for me. There is a lot of humor in them as well as a lot of violence. It evens out. I watched seasons 1-4 straight through and finished season 5 last night. I gave them to my daughter for her collection. I will see this series through to the end and I highly recommend it for those who like a lot of action/violence. They are not for the faint of heart or for children.",1378598400,,540,4.05607476635514

4908072,1,B005ZCA0GM,I have been seriously unhappy with the quality of this DVD set. At least 2 of the discs so far have had some major glitches.... so much so that we had to skip entire portions of the DVD to get it to continue to play.

4908073,4,B005ZCA0GM,"I'm giving this program Four Stars. But it's not because I enjoyed the story line. It's because the writing was very good as was the directing. The actors fit their roles well and in some cases gave some exceptional performances. In my opinion that deserves at least Four Stars. Had the program been more in line with my personal likes in drama, I would have given it a higher rating.",1373068800,,384,4.5

4908104,5,B005ZCA0GM,"Gave the set as a gift.
Disk 1 of Season 3 would not play correctly.  No scratches, not visible flaws, just won't play through the episodes.
Have contacted the seller, and am waiting for a response on hwo they will address the issue.
Based on other reviews, I'm not the first one to get a bad disk in this costly set of disks.
Don't think I can blame the seller for a pre-packaged set (unless they knowingly sell low-quality merchandise), but they should be willing to make it right.
I hope I will be able to update this review with a positive resolution, rather than drop to a single star.

UPDATE:
10 minutes after sending the vendor a message about the problem, they have responded that they will replace the disk ASAP.
So far.. I'm very impressed..  Will update when the replacement is received.

4908177,5,B005ZCA0GM,"Love this series! It 's gritty, raw and action packed, but written and performed in a way that allows you to feel emotions and empathy for the characters. You feel a connection to them and end up routing for them even in the midst of turmoil they may have caused themselves.",1356912000,,274,4.392156862745098
4908178,3,B005ZCA0GM,"One of the disks in season one was scratched and skips, this is upsetting since it was just purchased and is stated to be new. The shows are great other than that",1356912000,,162,4.09375
4908179,4,B005ZCA0GM,"We were pleased with the purchase but have found one spot in the first season that had a glitch and we missed a scene.  We'll continue watching the rest of the seasons and are on the look out for other flaws.  So far, we'll accept that one flaw but we're hoping there aren't more!",1356480000,,280,4.166666666666667

8489559,3,B005ZCA0GM,The DVDs work great no scratches but the description is bull they say that season 5 will be included as a bonus but it isn't and the seller claims it doesn't say that and will not honor the description! This is frustrating to say the least!!,1410825600,,241,4.260869565217392
8489560,1,B005ZCA0GM,"There is nothing wrong with the DVD's themselves.
The reason for the poor rating is because I followed a link that said seasons 1 - 4 and BONUS GIFT of season 5.  I showed my sister because we are on a huge budget.
We made the purchase.
We received the USED copies, that we ordered but not season 5.
The vendor said that he never included the gift and that it was not a link that I followed.
It was there. My 35 year old sister saw it, too.
I will not purchase from that vendor again.  I've had no other problems with other Amazon vendors or products.",1410825600,,551,4.092592592592593
