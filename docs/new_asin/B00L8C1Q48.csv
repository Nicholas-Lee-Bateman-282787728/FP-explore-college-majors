6474262,5,B00L8C1Q48,"This 2-disc DVD set contains 3 out of all 5 Tom and Jerry Christmas classics (The only ones missing are A Nutcracker Tale from 2007, which was Joe Barbera's last great achievement, and the Tom and Jerry Show episode The Plight Before Christmas from 2014); the very first one, The Night Before Christmas from 1941, which debuted only 1 day before Pearl Harbor was attacked (no fibbing!), and was the very first Hanna-Barbera Christmas classic, Ho Ho Horrors, which officially kicked off Tom and Jerry Tales in 2006, and the main attraction from 2014, Santa's Little Helpers, in the same Flash-animation style of the new Tom and Jerry Show! The other 27 shorts are classic Tom and Jerry shorts, from the Hanna-Barbera AND Chuck Jones eras (the latter era in their original Fullscreen format; the Chuck Jones Collection set had all 34 of his shorts in Faux-Widescreen, when comparing them to being seen on Boomerang!), and from Tom and Jerry Tales, many of which have nothing to do with Christmas OR winter! Don't ask me why they made a Christmassy collection this big, with a bunch of everyday shorts, or why A Nutcracker Tale & The Plight Before Christmas were never included here. If you wish to own this collection of both old and new Tom and Jerry shorts, Christmassy and otherwise, go right ahead, especially for the sake of your kids if you have any, since CN ain't showing the classic shorts lately. If Bill Hanna was perturbed about this, you can count on him to yell ""AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"" for Tom, or any other male character in their universe!",1429488000,5,1550,4.765799256505576

8664303,5,B00L8C1Q48,I think Tom and Jerry are  synonomous with The Pink Panther who I actually like better. My brother and his wife got my nephews and niece interested in  Tom and Jerry and my mom rejected the idea of me getting one of my nephews a Pink  Panther dvd for Christmas one year on the basis that The Pink Panther is for older people when I watched it as a kid. Anyway Tom and Jerry grows on you too and I  bought a few of their dvds.  That includes this Christmas one where the title track Santas Little Helpers is one of the best shorts. You should get this. Merry Christmas.,1485734400,,568,4.127272727272727
