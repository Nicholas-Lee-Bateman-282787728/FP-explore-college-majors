7995040,3,B0000A0DXC,"Image Entertainment has released a DVD transfer of the 1971 German film X312 - Flug zur Hlle (X312 - Flight to Hell). Unfortunately the transfer is OK (not great) but is brought down by the fact Image has authored it as non-anamorphic so one has to zoom in the image to utilize a big screen. In doing so, the picture quality suffers.  They have however kept the 1.66 AR (even if non-anamorphic) and the runtime is close to the original so the naked frauleins und madchens are left intact. Another plus is they have left the german audio and included optional English subtitles. This may not appeal to those who prefer dubbed foreign movies but as a purist it gets the thumbs up from me.",1490400000,3,686,4.488

7995042,4,B0000A0DXC,"Having recently viewed Director John Farrow's 'BACK FROM ETERNITY'-1956 , I was going through my titles and noticed Director Jess Franco's 'X-312-FLIGHT TO HELL'-1970 and decided to give it another view.  Having purchased this back in 2004 and not very familiar with the Franco canon of films as yet, I did not appreciate this on first viewing and decided to give it its just due.  Obviously the other reviewer represented here was either not familiar with Franco's work or expected a disaster movie and thus was really not kind to it.  The film does have a cheapness to it because at the time he was cranking out films for Producer Artur Brauner and it seems rushed by inferior camera work and mishmosh script flaws.  Franco must have been a fan of Farrow's 'ETERNITY' because a major part of the film emerges as a remake with the passengers all having a secret and the plane crashing this time in the Matto Grosso jungle with,of course, hostile natives. The film then changes course (no pun intended) by becoming a jewel heist double cross movie.  Euro fans will enjoy Fernando Sancho chewing up the scenery along with Franco regulars Paul Muller, Howard Vernon and Franco himself in a cameo.  The heroics is held up by Thomas Hunter and eroticism in the beautiful clothed assets of Esperanza Roy having a close resemblance to Euro actress Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott.  It's an enjoyable romp with a great twist ending in a tight 83 minute running time.  The music score by the always welcome Bruno Nicolai makes it look like a Euro Western. Image released the German print in a nice 1.85 transfer with English Subtitles.  With the way that Redemption is re-releasing alot of the old Image catalog, we may get a transfer into Blu-Ray status.  A different type of Franco opus, it deserves a better reputation and is a must for sleazy action fans.",1343347200,3,1850,4.735202492211838
7995043,2,B0000A0DXC,"If you read the hype you might be fooled into thinking that this movie is something of a lost treasure from a groovier time.  However, even being a plot-blind fan of B-cinema, this really is hopelessly lame.  At least until the last 30 minutes that is.  The movie is obviously seriously low budget, and the first hour has little by way of action or entertainment to reward the viewer.  Once crashed on the ground, the group of survivors meander along with all the urgency of ""picnic at hanging rock"".  The shoot out with diamond chasing villains has less action than a Sunday afternoon game of lawn bowls.  Likewise, the encounter with savage natives could hardly be more boring.  If you still haven't turned off by now, the last 30 minutes combine action, sleaze and betrayal into something that starts to resemble the movie they described on the back of the DVD cover.  Overall, this movie doesn't live up to its hype and its also not worth watching just to laugh at how stupid it is. However the last 30 minutes are rewarding if you can stick it out that long. Bring some beers, bring your mates and buckle up for an hour of boredom.",1091232000,5,1136,4.534313725490196
