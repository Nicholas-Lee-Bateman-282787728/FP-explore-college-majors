7897406,5,6305872201,"I am not going to even mention how blissful I feel seeing this title for sale. Granted, the Dub-Title of ""Samurai X"" is extremly cheesy,  the Sub-titled version is what I'm going to talk about here.
The OAV  takes place 10 years BEFORE the TV series (TV series being sold by Media  Blaster), and revolves around the a character named Himura Kenshin, a  master assasin fighting against the tyranical Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan  as part of the Ishin Shi Shi. It involves war, oppresion, deception, love,  death, and tragedy. A tale of a man in turmoil with himself, as he believes  that by killing, one may protect the innocent. A beautful and  heartwrenching tale, wonderfully animated with magnificent fight scenes  that godly grace the screen. Though a completely SERIOUS departure from the  TV series, which had a bit of humor thrown in here and there, this is  definately a good reason for anyone to find out just who WAS Kenshin before  the TV series. My recommendation? BUY IT!",965260800,,983,4.785714285714286
7897407,5,6305872201,"If you want to see a perfect anime watch Rurouni Kenshin.  The ova is the most incredible anime I have ever seen.  On top of that the TV series the ova is based off is very cool.  The ova has lots of violence and incredible  swordplay (the sword play in the ova feels more like a beatifull art style  than two guys trying to kill eachother.)  Scary, extremly imersive, and a  very cool surprise ending.  GET IT!",963532800,,411,4.246753246753247
7897408,5,6305872201,"This I believe is the first episode of a four part OAV series that was made after the original run of the Rurouni Kenshin TV series, but takes place ten years before the series starts and gives the background on  Kenshin- the main charactor.  ADV is releasing the subtitled version under  the original title, Rurouni Kenshin, but is changing the title of the dub  to a cheasy ""Samurai X"".  The OAVs are very dramatic and  powerful- beautifully animated with a trajic story.  A warning- it is very  violent, although contains no nudity.  I highly reccomend this VHS.",962755200,2,565,4.742268041237113
7897409,5,6305872201,"The anime Rurouni Kenshin is set in Japan in the 1860's, 10 years after the end of the bloody Meiji Revolution against the Tokugawa Government. The plot of the series centers around one of the most important persons of the  Meiji movement, Kenshin Himura, the most feared warrior of the Ishin  Shishi. During the Meiji War, Kenshin was called Hitokiri Battousai, which  roughly translates to Assassin Sword Master. As the war comes to an end,  Kenshin looks back at all the death he has caused and decides to never kill  again. To do this, he leads the life of a wandering Rurouni(masterless  samurai) and wields a reverse-edged sword called sakabatou. In other words,  a katana with the blunt side on the front and the sharp edge on the  backside. Still, he is quite dangerous with the sword since his Hiten  Mitsurugi style enables him to attack with great force without killing his  opponents. But things won't be so easy for him as the Hitokiri Battousai in  him is tempted to come out in numerous occations.
Besides Kenshin, there  are three other main characters that he meets throughout the first  episodes. They are Kaoru Kamiya, Yahiko Myojin, and  Sanosuke Sagara. I  won't say much about these guys since learning about them is half the fun  when watching the show. Kaoru is the daughter of the now late founder of  the Kamiya Kashin school of Kendo. She inherits her father's dojo and  proceeds to teach his style, which promotes that swords are meant to  protect. Yahiko comes from a family with a strong samurai heritage but both  his parents died as a result of the war. Finding himself alone, he was  taken in by a band of thieves that make him do their dirty work, which is  mainly pickpocketing. Sanosuke is a young warrior who's always looking for  a good fight. Also, he has a deep hatred for the Meiji government for  reasons you'll find out later on.
Once you see the first few episodes  you'll be as hooked as I was when I watched it for the first time 3 years  ago. RK is a truly magnificent series. You'll hopelesslly fall in love with  the deep characters, the always-interesting plot, the awesome animation,  and the fantastic music. Simply put, anime just doesn't get much better  than this. Plus, hey, you'll be learning about one of Japan's most  important time periods and have fun at the same time! Once you watch it  you'll never forget it.",962668800,6,2373,4.659420289855072
7897410,5,6305872201,"As I recall, there are only 6 OAV episodes that tell the story of Himura Kenshin in his youthful beginning.  These episodes show what happened before the TV series and before he met Kaoru, Sanosuke, Yahiko etc.  The  OAVs are for more adult viewers because they do contain violence and  bloodshed.  Just note that these are not the TV episodes.",962236800,,344,4.666666666666667
7897411,5,6305872201,"A truly great story needs many ingredients: action, love, good, evil, and strong, real, motivated characters. A great anime needs this and superb animation as well as a hauntingly good soundtrack. A perfect anime needs  Himura Kenshin, the rurouni -- a wandering samurai who, in an effort to  attone for years of murder during the Meiiji revolution, wields his sword  now to protect life and the freedom of every person living in the new  post-war era. Rurouni Kenshin is strengthened by the reality of its  characters. The good guys have bad streaks; the bad guys are fighting for  their own view of what is right.  This anime isn't about girls in skirts  fighting 20 ft. slime monsters; it's about real war, real love, and it's  based on the real history of Japan. Rurouni Kenshin is a must-see for anime  fans and first-timers alike. I would recommend R.K. for viewers of any age,  but be aware it contains animated violence and language that might not be  suited for very young children.",962064000,,991,4.764705882352941
7897412,5,6305872201,"Although I've only seen 8 episodes, It's one of my favorite shows ever.  I like it becaues theres comedy, action, it's depressing, and some sexyness among the male characters.  In other words, its one of those perfect shows.  It's about a Samuri Warrior that was an Assasin, but then noticed how many  innocent people he has been killing and swore himself never to kill a soul  again.  So he leaves the and travels for 10 years.  He soon meets Kaoru  Kamiya, a fierce 18 year old woman, who has the skills of a Master  swordsman.  He also meets Yahiko, Sanosuke, and later meets Megumi Takani  and Misao Makimachi.  About half of the show we  see a lot of minor battles  until Makoto  Shi-Shi-O comes in.  Who is Makoto Shi-Shi-O you ask?  He was  the replacement for Kenshin, once he left.  But then, the government found  no need for  him any more so they shot him in the head and burned him in  oil.  Somehow he survived and got a bunch of henchmen and decided that he  needed to kill Kenshin.  I'm not going to spoil the end.  There is no  nudity, but a lot of blood and violence.  This show in NOT for children.",960595200,5,1116,4.338235294117647
