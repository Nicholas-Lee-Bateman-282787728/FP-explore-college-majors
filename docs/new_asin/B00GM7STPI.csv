6086275,4,B00GM7STPI,This was an enlightening movie.  We were intrigued because we did not know the history of Diana's post divorce saga.  The movie attempted to show the struggles of her being one of the most famous people on the planet.  It also showed a personal side of her that the media had not explored.,1391731200,2,289,4.415094339622642
6086276,4,B00GM7STPI,I must have been living in a cave because I was completely unaware of this story about Diana. I was surprised that enjoyed it as much as I did but it kept my attention for the full movie even though you know how it ends.,1391644800,4,220,3.911111111111111
6086277,4,B00GM7STPI,"Naomi watts never strikes out.
on that basis or statement I base my review.
I liked this movie. whether it actually depicts Diana's motives to be with dodi is inconsequential. she was
a fabulous woman involved in humanitarian efforts on behalf of those who were suffering and on behalf of ridding the world of landmines. romantically, the movie deals with conflicts many of us face when we love some one who is leading a different life from the one we have been thrust into or have chosen. I enjoyed this movie.",1391558400,3,511,4.626373626373627
6086278,1,B00GM7STPI,"This tortuous bio-pic is slow, dull, somewhat silly and not up to the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Naomi Watts is a great actress and may have gotten Diana's bearing and accent right, but never once did she ""become"" Diana. The physical dissimilarity is too much to suspend disbelief. The script is a boring, earnest, paint by the numbers job and a lot of the beats are either cringe-inducing or just plain silly - like 50s soap opera and you won't learn anything new about the Princess. I hope Naomi Watts and Naveen Andrews got big paydays out of this, because this flick will do nothing for their resumes. One star for the beautiful locations and scenes of paparazzi frenzy. Princess Diana deserves better than this.",1391472000,5,719,4.669291338582677
6086279,4,B00GM7STPI,"I visited London about 15 years ago, and I was riding the subway somewhere downtown and underground.  A sign inside read something like ""Leicester Square,"" and some smart-alec girl -- err, nice young English woman -- pointed up at the word ""Leicester"" and asked me how I'd pronounce it.  Cute.  Me runners must've given me away, so that's how she 'twas clevah 'nough to know that I was an American.  And therefore couldn't pronounce ""Leicester.""  Ah, she and her fellow lovelies had a few cute little laughs while I struggled trying to pronounce some stupid word.

And I've noticed that people from England who visit America love to rip all over our political system -- hey, you won't hurt my feelings, as I don't think much of it myself -- but they get all cranky if you don't say how great the Royal Family is, or how much better their system is than ours.  Yes, they can dish it out, but they surely cannot take it.

I just think that they should dump the Royals myself; it would save them a lot of money.  Plus, what good do they really do, anyways?  Jousting isn't that important anymore -- it hasn't been since the middle ages -- but there is something even better nowadays:  nuclear weapons.  If you don't have those I suppose that land mines just might do the trick.  Sure, the English might take in a few pounds more from foolish Americans who want to cross the Atlantic just to see royalty, and maybe take in the Tower of London.  (I actually recommend that site myself if you go; that was pretty entertaining.)  But the royal coffers are getting so low that even the Queen was recently chastised for being poor with, well, The Queen's Money.

If you're getting the impression that I couldn't care less about the Royals, or even England itself, you're pretty quick.  And in reality, when everyone was going crazy about the real-life Princess Diana back in the '90s, I just mostly shrugged and found her to be a little bit of a bore.  ""Land mines are quite dangerous.""  Really?  You think?  I guess that she was the Princess of Understatement as well.

But the interesting thing is, while everyone else seems to hate this film -- I believe that only 8 percent of critics liked it according to Flixster with ""Rotten Tomatoes"" -- I actually really liked this film.  I thought that the cinematography was really good to start.

And even though I always complain when movies try to play with the viewers' emotions -- and this one is surely not exempt from that -- this one does it in more subtle and reasonable ways.  I thought that Naomi Watts -- and I will admit that I am a pretty big fan -- was spot on here, and she comes across as a very sympathetic character, even though she plays a Brit.  (I believe that Diana originally was from Wales; isn't that a ""Brit"" as well?"")  And Naveen Andrews made an excellent love interest here, and I usually complain about love interests in film, too.  Why do Americans always mistakenly believe that there must be a love interest in film?  Well, in this one, a love interest is required.

That love interest is required because we need to see that, while Princess Diana was supposedly ""loved by five billion people around the world"" (her words), she was perhaps really loved by none.  But I think that you will love Ms. Watts in this film, and really, would you expect anything less from her?  Cheers.",1391472000,2,3349,4.53
6086280,3,B00GM7STPI,"""Somewhere between right and wrong there is a God, and I will meet you there."" Two years before her tragic death Diana (Watts) was trying to handle a very public divorce as well as trying to get her love life back in order. When she meets Dr. Hasnat Khan (Andrews) she begins to think she found her answer. Little by little the two begin to fall in love but her celebrity winds up making the choice for them. I am a huge fan of bio-pics and was looking forward to this one mainly because this happened at a time that I remember. I wasn't a big follower of the royal family but when she did I remember she died with a man named Dodi Fayed so the whole love story aspect of the movie (though the main focus) seemed inconsequential. I know this was a love story movie going in but when they added in scenes where she is talking about land mines or mentions that she visits children in hospitals they felt like an after thought. Much like Iron Lady this movie shows a specific personal love story rather then the greatness of the individual. To that end the movie doesn't do Diana justice, as a love story it is OK. Naomi Watts however was great in this. Overall, doesn't focus enough on the things that made Diana great and the reason she was so loved enough for me to really get into it. I give it a B-.",1388793600,15,1301,4.208
6086281,2,B00GM7STPI,In terms of her jewelry and style it was five star all the way! Naomi Watts was convincing !! The story and plot really failed though because first off her children are not featured just in a distance which in reality her children were everything to her and to not include this in the movie is ridiculous! Second her marriage was the number one headline in the world not much interaction with Prince Charles or any Royals in the movie. Third her death rocked the universe and the accident is not even mentioned no funeral scenes nothing! After the movie you are given an image of a selfish woman who gets easily obsessed with men !! is this the super humanitarian that won over every bodies heart!! No I don't think so!! This does not do justice to the memory of this amazing woman and sadly it leaves us with a not so good image of her even though she was outstanding in real life!!,1388275200,13,883,4.357575757575757
6086282,4,B00GM7STPI,"""Diana"" (2013 release from the UK; 113 min. ) brings the last 2 years in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. As the movie opens, we see Diana (played by Naomi Watts) getting ready in the Ritz Hotel in Paris, on that infamous day of August 31, 1997. Then the movie jumps back 2 years earlier. Diana and Charles are living separate lives. We see Diana in sweatpants and unhappy (and alone) at her London residence). By chance Diana meets Hasnat Khan, a Pakistani heart surgeon (played by Naveen Andrews). It isn't before long that Diana and Khan are falling for each other, and must go to extraordinary measures to keep this a secret from the press and from the world. Khan tells Diana about his passion for football (a/k/a soccer) and jazz, and at one point Diana even dons a black wig and the two go to a jazz club in London, where Diana has the time of her life. To tell you more of the 'plot' would be pointless.

Several comments: this movie has been universally panned by the critics, and it obviously has not done well at the box office either (more on that later), so I must admit I had some doubts about seeing this, but given that Naomi Watts was playing Diana, I took a chance on this. As it turns out, I quite enjoyed this movie! I have no idea whether the events between Diana and Kahn as depicted in this movie are accurate or whether some of them even happened at all (did the two of them really snuck out of London in Diana's butler's car and took a trip to the cliffs of Dover?). But in the end, the details are not what matter, in the sense that this movie gives a great glimpse into the utter loneliness that surrounds Diana when she is not out in the public (the movie restages a number of iconic moments from those last 2 years, including the infamous ""Queen of Hearts"" interview with the BBC in November ;95, the trip to Angola to meet landmine victims, etc.). Besides the loneliness, Diana also comes across as insecure and sometimes childish (at one point when arguing with Khan, she yells out ""I'm a princess and I get what I want!""), so this movie is not just a one-directional flattering image of Diana. And then there is the non-stop haunting by the press, in particular the paparazzi photographers. It is so relentless, one cannot even begin to imagine what it really must have been like to live in the limelight like that. The last 30 min. of the movie (about Diana and Dodi Fayed) are painful to watch, as by then her life has become a complete circus, in fact more like a Greek tragedy, the ending of which we all know. This movie was capably directed by German director Oliver Hirschbiegel (best known for that Hitler movie ""The Downfall"" some years ago). But the true star of the movie is of course Naomi Watts, who took a big professional gamble when she agreed to take on the role of such an iconic figure. She pulls it off brilliantly in my opinion, and this is another Oscar nomination-worthy performance.

""Diana"" opened on 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati this past weekend, and given the negative buzz around this movie, I figured this would not be playing long so I went to see it today. The screening I saw this at was unfortunately not well attended. It's a shame, as this movie for me turned out to be a pleasant surprise, even if the subject matter is not a happy one (you won't walk out of this thinking ""that was a jolly good time!""). Bottom line: ""Diana"" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1384214400,90,3484,4.416796267496112

6086284,4,B00GM7STPI,"Diana is a love story that focuses on the last two years of Princess Diana's life and her relationship with Hasnat Khan. This film received a thrashing from film goers and critics alike and yet remains a popular rental despite these reviews. As of this writing, the film cost approximately $15 million to make and made $21.7 million. So not as much of a clunker at the box office as we are led to believe by the public vitriol concerning this film. Considering that the screenings were limited, it made it's money back -- and a bit more.

 Is it that we miss Diana so much that we would watch anything Diana? Or is it that it does not live up to our own personal ""icons"" of Diana that displeases us so? It is often lambasted for the ""negative space"" around it - or what it isn't. We are furious that the filmmakers did not tell the story we wanted them to tell.  Lost in this is the fact that it is based on a book by Kate Snell, ""Diana: Her Last Love."" The film's focus was narrow -- and very focused on the emotional part of the story.

To me I saw a woman who is experiencing her first real love with a worthy partner and someone who never took advantage of her as all her other relationships did.  It treats its subject respectfully so it hints at Diana's obsessiveness, but does not dawdle there. It highlights her willfulness but doesn't make a best friend of it. The children are shown only at a distance and the romantic scenes are modest. This is a film about an intimate, one on one, connection she had with Hasnat Khan and the tension that existed between them who, recognizing a soul mate in each other, are trying to figure out how to make it ""work"" with the limitations of different cultures, fame, professional dedication, and each other's strong personalities. And in that sense it does succeed. One can only guess at how frustrating this dilemma - of meeting a soul mate, with these kinds of challenges, must have been for both of them.  Yet their bond was strong - both of their lives were deeply rooted in healing and helping others - and it was Diana's longest lasting relationship of all her paramours.

The movie does a good job of highlighting their story and some of the private moments they shared. Naomi Watts does a great job playing the Princess as does Naveen Andrews who plays Hasnat Khan. The writing for the most part is very good. This is a vignette, not a novel, and it leaves us rooting for and wondering about what their future could have been had Princess Diana lived.",1502582400,,2505,4.420824295010846

6086290,2,B00GM7STPI,"I watched this for Naomi Watts not Diana. I don't really understand what Diana saw in that guy but that tends to be my reaction to every moderately attractive woman's relation with any man who is not me. Basically I can't get too worked up about how miserable people are who live in the lap of storybook wealth all snatched from the public trough. I am sure royalty and other jet setters are often miserable and have every right to be miserable as they want. But running off with a playboy on his yacht is not my idea of lashing out or even a particularly painful existence. I'm sure any London cabbie could have introduced her to real misery. Most obnoxious are the movie making toadies who glorify these characters and their brave, noble and anguished lives. Watts is a different story. Unlike Diana (who has a kind of horsey quality), she is hot as merde and must have spent countless hours studying tape to get the mannerisms, gait and accent just right. Her make-up hair which seems to have carried over from J. Edgar makes her look dumpy and old. Goes to show what a slight change in lips and eyes can do (as Uma Thurman can attest). The filmmakers kept the essential babe under wraps but that is compensated for by Watts' performance. When she doesn't just sleepwalk through her damsel in distress roles she has a pretty good range. To see that watch Diana, 21 Grams, Mother and Child and Sunlight Junior (her best performance) in succession. Once she finally lands a crazed murderer role of the kind Charlize Theron specializes in, she might actually get her Oscar. In Diana we just get one shot of Watts' smokin' legs. If you want to feast on Watts' body in a succession of cutoffs and micro minis you have to suffer through St. Vincent.",1492992000,,1746,4.546031746031746

But the romance with Hasnat seems desperate from the outset, and since the script revolves around it, and our being drawn into it, -- which does not, in my opinion, quite work -- we are left with yet another soggy documentary of a Princess whose Prince turned out to be a frog and who died too soon and too violently.  I also felt that despite her efforts, Ms. Watts fails to capture Diana's energy and vitality.  Rather, she imitates it.  It is interesting that the most moving sequence in the movie is the one with the people bringing flowers to Kennsington Palace, a moment not essential to the focus of this particular story.  Diana's pull on the imagination of strangers was central to an understanding of her unique mixture of hope and despair, and is a quality that the film only glimpses briefly.  Nonetheless, this movie is sincere in an effort to reveal something of the mystery of a woman who both defied and embodied conventional attitudes about women, family, and power.",1462752000,2,1140,4.67

6086316,4,B00GM7STPI,"Diana (2013). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One hour, 52 mins.
Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegal. Written by Stephen Jeffreys. Inspired by the book, Diana's Last Love, by Kate Snell.

The movie begins on the night of August 30, 1997 in Paris, France. Lady Diana (Naomi Watts) leaves her bathroom and her cell phone behind. She is ready to go out to dinner with her companion, Dodi Fayed. As she walks down the hallway, she suddenly stops and looks behind her as if she senses something. She then continues to walk and into the elevator with Dodi (Cas Anvar) and the guards.
  Then the movie goes back 2 years. She has already been separated from her husband, Prince Charles of Wales, and it would be another year before they are legally divorced.
  A friend of hers, Sonia (Juliet Stevenson), calls her to the hospital about her husband. When the doctor reports to Sonia, Diana gets to meet him. He is a Pakistan heart surgeon, Dr. Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews).  Diana was impressed by him and wishes to see him again. The doctor was strictly professional and back to work.  She makes an effort to go back to the hospital just to meet him again. He is kind to her and accepts her invitation to visit.
  This movie tells of the relationship between  Diana, Princess of Wales and  Dr. Hasnat Khan from 1995 to 1997. Their relationship ended in June 1997, just 3 months before she died in a horrible car accident with her new companion, Dodi Fayed.

Also in the cast: Charles Hodge, Douglas Hodge, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Art Malik, Tony Blair.

Language and subtitles in English only.

DVD case includes 14-page booklet, ""Diana Fashion"", clothing worn by Naomi Watts as ""Diana"".

6086320,2,B00GM7STPI,"I really wanted to like this movie, but after reading a few books about Princess Diana, I now understand why this movie is so unsatisfying. Diana was no saint and was all too human (she had low self-esteem, poor concentration and excessive neediness) but you'd never know it watching this film.  Thanks to an unimaginative script, Naomi Watts is more like the naive but charming Audrey Hepburn character in ""Roman Holiday"" - a frustrated, lonely princess who just wants a normal love affair and finally gets her wish when she meets her real Prince Charming, Hasnat Khan. The film feels like it's told all from Princess Diana's point of view, where she's always the misunderstood victim while everyone else is unreliable, untrustworthy and unloving.  As they say, it takes two to tango, and what makes this film boring (who would have thought anything involving Diana could be boring?) is the way it presents the Princess as sometimes misguided but always sympathetic and loveable.

Considering her well-documented emotional problems, bulimia, and provocative persona, this film reduces her from a fascinating and complicated figure into your garden variety ""princess in a gilded cage"" stereotype who finds ""true love"" but predictably can't make it last.  The film's only edginess comes from the fact that it depicts an interracial love affair, and even that is whitewashed (pardon the pun).  There is no mention whatsoever of the racist death threats Khan received as a result of their romance, and everything is soaked in a romantic, nostalgic and melancholy haze (the allusions to the Princess' premature death are evident throughout).

It's as if the filmmakers themselves worshipped Diana too much, to the point of being so blind to her faults they were ready to forgive her for almost anything (let's not speak ill of the dead, etc.).  Unfortunately, saint-like figures make very boring movies.  Naomi isn't a bad actress, but the film gives her almost nothing to do except mimic Diana's voice and gestures.  What a shame - Diana becomes just a symbol, something she hated being when she was alive.",1442361600,5,2103,5.072463768115942

When I first viewed Naomi Watts in the trailer, I thought she was terrible in the part of Diana, not even close in her beauty (Lady Di 5'10 while Naomi Watts is 5""5), but I was immediately won over as I started t watch her voice, her mannerisms.

6086336,3,B00GM7STPI,"Diana is biographical film about the life during the last two years of the late Princess Diana. It stars Naomi Watt on the title role and it was based on Kate Snell's 2001 book Diana: Her Last Love. The screenplay written by Stephen Jeffreys starts when Diana and Prince Charles gets divorced and then enters into a relationship with Dr. Hasnat Khan,a Pakistani heart surgeon. It also provides us her tours around the world to campaign against the use of land mines as well as her fashion causes. The film ends the mysteries surrounding her death in a car crash at a time when she was dating Egyptian Dodi Fayed.

No question that this was one poor movie considering that the film barely provides anything new about Princess Diana. Everything in it has been already a common knowledge to anyone who is following the current events. It was made only to have a film depiction of the event that happened particularly when the Princess died on a car crash. It would have been better if it provided us something new particularly about the untold chapters of her life and more details about her that are mostly unknown to people. The only positive thing about this movie is Naomi Watts' portrayal of the late princess. But even that is wasted in a movie like this. A better film should be made about princess sometime in the future.",1427587200,,1326,4.61864406779661

6086356,5,B00GM7STPI,"Despite the negative reviews this film has garnered, I still took a chance and purchased this DVD...and I'm very glad I did.  As a longtime admirer of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, I was impressed by the great care given to her portrayal by actress Naomi Watts and the production crew.  Clearly those involved with this film went to great lengths to ensure the last two years of Princess Diana's life, specifically her romance with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, were conveyed to show a post-HRH Diana as a world-famous yet ordinary woman who was vulnerable and longing to be loved.  Inevitably, this attempt to balance both her public and private lives turned out to be impossible.

It appears Ms. Watts worked very hard on her body to match the gym-trim figure of the late Princess.  It is also apparent that she studied Diana's stance, gestures, movements and voice to prepare for this role (no small task).  The costumers, hairdressers and makeup artists deserve praise as well for their attempts to make Naomi Watts resemble Princess Diana as much as possible.  The set designers, lighting crew, etc., are also to be commended for their efforts.  As a result, I felt as though I were actually inside the Imperial Suite at the Paris Ritz during the film's opening and closing scenes as well as inside the majestic Kensington Palace.

Princess Diana met Dr. Hasnat Khan at a London hospital in 1995 during the former's visit to a friend.  A relationship soon blossomed, and both went to extreme measures to keep their romance out of the spotlight, to include Diana donning a brown wig in public and Hasnat being hidden inside a car as it entered Kensington Palace.  But the secret could not stay hidden forever, especially with the paparazzi hounding Diana's every move.  The media pressure became too much for Hasnat, as depicted in this film, and the pair subsequently parted.

Naveen Andrews, who portrays Hasnat, delivered a charming performance as a down-to-earth doctor who, up until his romance with Diana was exposed, led a very private life, but simply could not handle being under the media microscope.  The love and chemistry between the two characters were well-conveyed on screen, I felt, and both Naomi Watts and Naveen Andrews should be applauded for this.  And when Mr. Andrews, as Hasnat, approached Kensington Palace to leave a bouquet of flowers after Diana's death, my heart sank just as his did.

The reality of the romance between Princess Diana and Dr. Khan is only known to them.  Whether the events that transpired in this movie are truly for real is questionable; nevertheless, this doubt should not deter one from viewing this remarkable film.  Memories of Diana, Princess of Wales, at one time the most famous woman in the world, are bound to resurface...to include, sadly, the worldwide heartbreak when she tragically passed away on 31 August 1997.",1414454400,2,2891,4.925773195876289

I knew the film was in trouble from the start. Naomi Watts looks more like Camilla Parker Bowles than Diana, particularly in a few of the misguided hairstyles the actress sports. I'm sorry, but Watts is TOO OLD for the part and I found myself staring intently at her face for all the wrong reasons. Diana had a magical, lit-from-within quality, a compelling way of carrying herself; in fact, in her later years, what would only be called regal bearing. Diana, whatever her faults (and most of us, the public, have been schooled in them over the years) was stunning. Watts as Diana, is none of these things. She is dull as tepid swimming pool water. Flat, uninteresting, charmless. It's inconceivable that Watts' character might have ever captured the attention of the future King of England (who inexplicably makes no appearance in the film), let alone the numbers of other men, she apparently did, including a brilliant heart surgeon. There's no chemistry, sexual or otherwise, between Watts' Diana and Andrews' Khan, which is more misfortune. I found myself slogging through their affair, uninterested and unprovoked to dredge up any feelings about it one way or the other.

Despite the money poured into the production, evident from the lush sets, locations, clothes, etc., this film has made-for-TV all over it. I became embarrassed for the participants as I watched it. Speaking of, most of the people in the film seem to serve as living props - nobody really makes their presence felt in a meaningful way. Again, the script doesn't help matters.

Thankfully, the film does not dramatize the car accident which killed Diana. I think that would have been unforgivable in this limp, uninspired production.",1402790400,,1960,4.951367781155016

6086390,4,B00GM7STPI,"""Diana"" is not a comprehensive biography of the beloved Princess Diana - just the year or two before her death, after she had finally ended her marriage and was striving to create a new life for herself. She cared deeply about people and had a sensitive soul. She struggled to find a cause that she could embrace and make a difference. She also yearned to find real love and to find some sense of normalcy in her life. The movie does portray her vulnerability as well as her steel resolve.

At first, I found the choice of actress, Naomi Watts, a bit disorienting (she was really too short for the part), but Naomi obviously studied for the part and adopted many of Diana's mannerisms and turned in a commendable performance in the role. I was also uncomfortable with the intimate details of her relationship with the Pakistani doctor, played by Naveen Andrews. Diana did not keep a journal, so it seems that a lot of the dialogue and action in the movie were speculative. Did she really use Prince Dodie as a screen to deflect press attention away from her Pakistani doctor? We'll never really know.

6086401,2,B00GM7STPI,"Oliver Hirschbiegels Diana chronicles the last two years of Diana, Princess of Wales (played by Naomi Watts), whose untimely death is still remembered by many. As most of us know what happened on the fatal day of 31 August 1997, the film naturally focuses something else, in this case her romantic relationship with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews).

The result is a superficial romance without much chemistry. Personally I have no problem with the silly dialogue and sentimental moments. Naomi Watts does her best and her performance as the late Princess is impressive, but the character she plays lacks depth and resonance.

What would it be going out with someone travelling around the world for international charities, someone who is chased by paparazzi? Diana misses chances to explore the intriguing aspect of their relationship. The film certainly portrays her as an independent and impulsive person, but it seems the director is not really interested in her personality as a humanitarian or a woman in love.

The remaining 5% of the movie showed a COUPLE of clips of her so-called love affair or whatever it was with Dodie.......Then the movie ended and I thought to myself, ""That's it????!!!""  Are you kidding me???
I also think this movie made Diana look really bad......Like she was chasing and stalking after this heart surgeon who didn't seem to care one way or the other about having a relationship with her!  The movie also showed what a lonely person she was since she couldn't see her 2 boys as often as she wanted to......

Although I have enjoyed many of Naomi Watts' performances, I wasn't so sure of any actresses ability to personify a woman who lived under a microscope, for all to examine (and judge).  I may be one of the ""nattering nincompoops"" Prince Phillip is shown to dismiss in the movie, ""The Queen""; but I was deeply saddened by Diana's tragic death.  ""Diana"" is worth a single viewing for its depiction of the Princess having a loving, semi-normal relationship with a London heart surgeon, who adored her, and high hopes of establishing a reasonably private home life with him.",1397865600,2,719,5.025210084033613

Naomi Watts neither looks nor sounds like Diana.

Then we get introduced to Naveen Andrews character....the hypocrite heart doctor. He smokes, he eats fatty foods..he actually asked her to send out for a burger after she went through all the trouble to make a nice meal.

6086415,3,B00GM7STPI,"DIANA was almost universally panned on its release in September, and continues to attract negative comments from users.  In truth it is not as bad as it was made out to be, even though some of the details seem implausible (would Diana (Naomi Watts) be able to leave Kensington Palace on her nocturnal visits to Hasnat (Naveen Andrews) so easily, without being discovered or hounded by reporters?)  Nonetheless Oliver Hirschbiegel's film does a competent job of portraying the sheer loneliness of Diana's existence in Kensington Palace, surrounded by servants but with no one to love her.  Although tremendously popular with people and the media alike, she cannot get close to anyone; and when she does, her love-affair is doomed.  Watts does not resemble Diana facially, but she does a good job of conveying both the good and not-so-good sides of her character; her desire to help people, her feeling of alienation from all families, and her tendency to manipulate the media to suit her purposes.  The film suggests, perhaps controversially, that Diana brought much of the press harassment on herself, especially when she asks a trusted photographer to take snaps of herself and Dodi Fayed (Cas Anvar), with the sole purpose of making Hasnat jealous, and thereby encouraging him to call her again after a long interval.  She certainly knows how to portray herself on screen - as seen, for instance, in her celebrated interview with the BBC's Martin Bashir (Prasanna Puwanrajah), where she deliberately adopts a pose for the camera so as to obtain maximum sympathy from viewers.  Nonetheless the film does suggest that she was more sinned against than sinning - a victim, perhaps, of the contemporary obsession with fame and celebrity.",1397088000,3,1734,5.084507042253521

6086420,3,B00GM7STPI,"I adored Princess Diana. I am guilty of buying up magazine after magazine. There was even one year that I couldn't read enough books about Diana. So much so that I felt that I knew her personally. However, I had never read much about her relationship with Hasnat Khan. I kind of felt like Diana liked to keep that part of her life private but we all have to know those details, too. So I see this movie available on Amazon and I couldn't wait for it to begin. All I could think of as I watched this movie was how much Diana would have loathed this film. In my head, I must have repeated ""POOR DIANA"" over and over. I felt guilty watching and I wanted so badly to change the outcome for her.  But we all know how this fairytale ends.
The film mostly covers the months of Diana's life that she spent with Hasnat Khan and the last month spent with Dodi. Obviously, it's part-fiction because no one knows what happened between Diana and Khan except for the two of them and I doubt Khan had much of a hand in the making of this film. It's an ok film but if you are a fan of the late princess then, of course, you must see it. I really like Naomi Watts' acting ability but NOT in this film. WHAT IS UP WITH THE HORRIBLE WIG? Really? Was that the best they could do for hair? Diana would never have allowed her hair to look that horrible.

Deep down I know she would've done well in her new life. Perhaps do more charity work, work in documentaries, get remarried and have that baby girl she always wanted.

The story told, however, is fairly light weight and fleeting as are so many film depictions of real people and real stories. It's worth watching for Ms. watts' performance. One real drawback is that it is hard to believe that Diana fell so hard for the Doctor because Naveen Andrews comes across as unattractive and rather boorish.

6086442,4,B00GM7STPI,"This is actually quite a good movie. It was not marketed properly. It is really not a bio pic. It does not show anything much of royal family interactions, even with her boys and Charles, which would be necessary in that type movie. If someone expects that, or expects the movie to show that over-the-top glitz and glamour of royal European life, they will be disappointed.

It should have been titled ""The Garden"" and marketed as more of a quiet, tragic love story. Actually most of the details are true, except for those they obviously had to invent. Acting, writing, and directing are quite good. The purpose here seems to be to show how life must have been for Diana in her last two years: what looks exciting in the gossip pages plays out in real life as quiet, lonely and isolating. I think the movie is successful at capturing and conveying this feeling. It is also successful in showing the characters as real people with contradictions in feeling and behavior. This movie is similar in tone to ""The Iron Lady"" which was also not very successful. However, in that movie, Margaret Thatcher shown as a real, fallible person, is just not that interesting or likable. Here, Diana is very likable, even with her flaws.

I really liked it, taking it for what it is. And it is masterful at portraying the feeling I believe all of us had at her death, of profound loss and a sense of incompleteness and waste of life and magic. If this film has a flaw, it is that Naomi Watts, who does a really good job here, still can't capture the unique magic that was Diana. She just doesn't come across with the captivating sense that Diana had. However, I don't know that anyone could do that. She was so unique.",1394928000,2,1702,4.5227272727272725

She's basically an old fashioned girl -who wound up way too rich (and trapped by the money and comfort) to find a normal life.  Buckingham Palace life is not normal.

In time she would be the beloved Queen Mother surrounded by the children of Princes and Henry, living in Clarence House.
But the dream was shattered in 1997.
I read all the diaries and dared to believe Mr. Fayed and refuse the official circumstances of her death.
I expected the film to be Mr. Fayed' story. There is a love story: but not with Dodi Fayed.
Without a spoiler, this film departs from that hypothetical time line and circumstances to surprise with a unique plot from the final Greek cruise and Paris trip with Dodi Fayed. But being ignorant of the othe man, the Palace does not release the alternate story.

There's also much about Diana's attempts to control what the press is saying, how Dr. Hasnat's work and personal life are affected, their constant efforts to dodge the paparazzi, etc. While it does go into some of the Princess's humanitarian projects in other parts of the world, there is virtually nothing on Diana's earlier years, the rest of the Royal Family, and/or a number of other things that would interest most viewers.

While it didn't thrill me, DIANA certainly kept my attention as a human interest/romance film. Naomi Watts, an actress it's hard to imagine giving a less-than-stellar performance, captures Lady Di quite well personality-wise and about as well as she could appearance-wise. The resemblance is far from perfect but close enough to where it didn't bother me. {Note: A number of people obviously disagree w/me on these last points.} Finally, though they seem a bit tacked-on in some places, the bits of poetry--such as the one used as the title of this review--still add a little something.

Though the plot is languid, DIANA succeeds in showing the difficulties of semi-forbidden relationships such as this, as well as in showing the all-too-plain humanity of Diana and, by proxy, anyone else who is given celebrity status.

6086466,3,B00GM7STPI,"Although Watts is an excellent actress, she doesn't have the flat facial contour essential for dominating the Diana visage; unfortunately she did not attempt the fine accent that distinguishes Diana. More English is talented Keira Knightley who promises to shape a face and diction match as Diana. The chemistry of Watts and the heart surgeon is not what it might have been with a different actor. An oblique story compounding Diana's Mid Eastern racial fascinations does not enhance the more positive aspects that Diana offered our illusions. Should you know the British history once so biased against Indians, it seems small of Diana to go that direction at any time - not insightful or much of a reigning princess. Perhaps she is the Press' Princess, not the People's Princess. This movie as story does diminish Diana's light, better left unsaid. Otherwise, DIANA is tolerable entertainment.",1393891200,,894,5.172413793103448
6086467,3,B00GM7STPI,"Naomi Watts seems well aware that no one can ever accurately depict the late Princess of Wales, but it's obvious that she tries her utmost best.  She must have spend thousands of hours watching the real Diana, because she gets all the moves right....the blush and shy dip of the head, the sidelong stare, the breathy voice, even the wounded eyes behind the dazzling smile so well known to the world.  When dressed in replicas of the famous jewels, the reproduction Versace and Catherine Walker gowns - we almost, but not quite can believe we've seen the whisper and the ghost of the beauty so tragically lost to this world.

The rest of the script is too much like a tabloid - this is probably what Diana and heart surgeon Hasnat Khan said to each other, this might not be what they said - there's too much guesswork, and it ends up being a tawdry reenactment of what was likely her most private and painful last years.  I'm ashamed I watched this movie, because it reminds me of why we lost one of the world's most courageous, caring and compassionate women.  The truth is that Diana WAS murdered - and by ALL OF US.  We bought the magazines with the photos the paparrazzi so grossly invaded her life to get, we hungered for the smallest details of our icon.  Perhaps she would still be alive today if the world, in its greed, hadn't provided a market for the last breaths she drew.

""Diana"" does pay fitting tribute to the greatest gifts Diana gave the world, with its depiction of her hospital visits and her campaign to ban land mines.  Naomi Watts faithfully portrays the late princess' compassion, with the horrified gaze, her disgust that her attempts to use her fame to bring attention to worthy causes was so often ignored in favor of glamor shots, the gentle brush of her fingertip over the tortured cheek of a child brutalized by a mine's blast.

Still, there's too much guesswork here, and an intrusion into the life and grief of her surviving friends, particularly Dr. Hasnat Khan. Their romance ended due to his aversion for the public life that Diana could never escape, and now the most private, intimate moments of his life have been thrown out for public curiosity and entertainment. Better that this movie had never been made - or, only with his approval.

There are girls, there are women, and there are ladies.  Diana was, in every sense, a Lady.  One can only pray that she is truly in a place where she can never be hurt or intruded up on again - since her privacy knows no respect, still, here on this Earth.",1393804800,3,2532,4.538461538461538
6086468,3,B00GM7STPI,"The critics really panned this film about the final years of the late Princess Diana. Personally, I found it very entertaining and worth viewing. Naomi Watts stars as the ill-fated princess and focuses on the last two years of her life. The film's main focus is the love story between Diana and Pakastani heart surgeon Dr. Hasnat Khan. Dr. Kahn is portrayed by actor Naveem Andrews (""The English Patient.) I thought both Watts and Andrews were very believable in their roles. Watts managed to convey the Princess as being very lonely in her final years in spite of being considered ""the most famous woman in the world."" She accurately depicts the princess as having great pain from her parents divorce and her mother deserting her family . She is again rejected by Prince Charles and shut out by the royal family after their divorce.  Also, I enjoyed the films sets (Kensington Palace) and  locations (it looked as though it was filmed in London.)

6086470,3,B00GM7STPI,"According to the Hollywood Reporter, November 3, 2013 by Pamela McClintock, PRINCESS DIANA BIOPIC BOMBS IN NORTH AMERICA: `Oliver Hirschbiegel's critically reviled biopic Diana -- starring Naomi Watts as the late Princess of Wales -- was quickly dethroned by moviegoers in North America, grossing $64,914 from 38 theaters for a bleak location average of $1,708. From a screenplay based on Kate Snell's 2001 book `Diana: Her Last Love', the ill-fated biopic recounts the final two years of Princess Diana's life, including her love affairs with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and Dodi Fayed. Story: 'Diana' Director Oliver Hirschbiegel Says Negative Reviews Are 'Devastating.' Diana opened a month ago in the U.K., where it also bombed (one British reviewer called it ""car crash"" cinema). Entertainment One, which is distributing the film in the U.S. and a number of other key markets, including the U.K., is hoping Diana finds an afterlife on DVD, VOD and other digital platforms.'

So now it is out on DVD and for those who elect to buy it (or see it on Pay per View) and the feelings remain mixed. The most brief summary of the film is this: `During the last two years of her life, Princess Diana embarks on a final rite of passage: a secret love affair with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.'

The work of Naomi Watts is consistently fine but due to some bleeps in makeup and hair design and mannerisms pasted on this fine actress she doesn't quite come across as the Diana the world worshiped. The script is plebeian, but some fine actors make the best of it - especially Geraldine Jones as Diana's masseuse and spiritual counselor Oonagh, Juliet Stephenson as her best (seemingly her only) friend Sonia, and Charles Edwards as her `manager'. Naveen Andrews tries to make the role of Hasnat Khan credible but doesn't quite get there. Cas Anvar gets very little to say as the controversial Dodi Fayed, and set-up photographer Paul is appropriately quiet as portrayed by Douglas Hodge. Yes, we are allowed to see the tip of the iceberg of Diana's generosity in righting social wrongs around the globe, but in the end the biopic fails to add anything new to the paparazzi besmirched life of a Princess the world loved.

6086478,4,B00GM7STPI,"Imagine if ""Saving Mr. Banks"" had been called ""Walt."" Imagine, then, the howling of its audience and reviewers that the film covered just his relationship with P.L. Travers, and that it didn't capture more of his life and complex personality. This ""Walt"" doesn't match what people had envisioned, given all that we know about Walt Disney and his impact on our time.

Such is the problem with ""Diana."" It should have been called ""Diana and the Doctor"" (terrible but I can't think of anything better right now) or something like ""An Affair to Remember.""

I've now seen Diana twice, and I think that the slew of bad reviews was unfair. I think it's a good little movie. And I think that Naomi's performance was brilliant. She was so brave to take it on, and she admirably walked a fine line between mimicry and relaxing into the role. I think everybody had their own Diana movie in their head, and this film couldn't live up to their expectations.

A key to it is ""Brief Encounter,"" mentioned by Naveen Andrews in the interview with him on the DVD. He had that film in mind when he accepted role. Made in 1945, it was a simple film that's a tiny masterpiece. Two married people meet and fall in love. They meet once a week at the movies. Then they must part. I can't remember all the details; I'm going to see it again. Anyway, ""Diana"" was a tightly focused film about a romance and its very special challenges. I wouldn't want to see a more active scene of Di with her boys, because that would shift the focus of the film. I think it was a movie that was true to its intention. I think Hasnat could have been more handsome and charismatic, as the real Hasnat is described, but Naveen was pretty good in the part nevertheless.

I feel really bad for Naomi and the director, who previously directed ""Downfall."" That movie is very contained--the characters are in a bunker, after all, until the end, and the director brought this bracketing to ""Diana."" He had less than two hours to tell the story, and so he stayed with the romance and managed to also hit the notes of Diana walking in the minefield, auctioning her clothes, making secret calls to the press about her whereabouts, and several other biographical bits from that time that tied into her relationship with Hasnat.

6086482,4,B00GM7STPI,"I have read other reviews of this movie and feel that the critics missed the point. This wasn't about Diana the legend. This movie was about Diana the person and how she dealt with life after her marriage fell apart. The larger than life, well publicized parts of her life are touched on, but not the important part of the movie. The main focus of the movie was about this love affair she had that she somehow managed to keep out of the public eye.  Her public life does make this affair impossible and the romance is bittersweet as a result. the actors are very good together and are believable as two people in an impossible situation. As far as Naomi as Diana, no one will ever portray Diana accurately because there is too much material and memory  to let people step back and be objective.  Naomi did what she could and Naveen Andrews was simply adorable. I do think some people were uncomfortable with ""their"" legend being mixed up with a Muslim, especially a non-white Muslim. The idea that this man treated her better and that she could be happy with him may have upset some people. I saw in other comments the ""he's too dark to play"" argument trotted out yet again even though this actor isn't any darker than others of his ethnic group or the person he was portraying.

6086488,4,B00GM7STPI,"Diana, Princess of Wales, was a prisoner of her glamorous image whether it was foisted on her by her handlers, created by the media, one she perpetuated herself, or a combination of all of the above.  This a very speculative film one where it hypothesizes what would become of Diana if she were allowed to be the person she wanted to be, to follow her heart, and love and be loved in return.  This isn't to suggest that she wasn't loved by her adoring public but she wasn't loved in that intimate way that we should all experience certainly not by Prince Charles.  The focus of ""Diana"" is a romantic entanglement between herself and a  Pakistani heart surgeon that is everything her marriage to Charles wasn't.  This relationship is a tender one shared by two intelligent people madly in love with each other.  I'm not sure this coupling existed or was elevated by the filmmakers to send a message.  The sense I get is the makers of the film are engaging in wish fulfillment, their own and posthumously for Diana. I also like how they deglamorize Diana taking off her makeup and allowing her humanizing blemishes to be shown both literally and figuratively. They point the finger at our celebrity obsessed culture with neither the paparazzi nor the public that lap up their offerings spared from blame.  I've read a lot of the negative reviews from other viewers and their criticism stems from it not being the film they wanted it to be.  I sense they wanted something glitzier and more melodramatic.  I give the makers props for constructing a film that dares to go against the assumptions of its intended audience.  Naomi Watts is outstanding as Diana as is Naveen Andrews as the surgeon.

I should have stuck to my original plan and skipped this poorly acted, unbelievable romance between Diana, Princess of Wales and Hasnat Klan, a Pakistani cardiologist,  Naomi Watts didn't  look, talk or share any physical characteristics except for short blond hair with Diana. If we are to believe this movie, Diana was selfish, egocentric and dumb enough to believe a divorced Christian women would be accepted as the bride to a devote Islamic man. I don't doubt Diana had an affair with Klan since she admitted to romances that occurred while she was still married to Prince Charles. I don't think the romance was the solution to all of Diana's problems including her abandonment issues that resulted from her parents divorce and compounded by Charles' ongoing affair with Parker-Bowles or taught her how to use her celebrity status to bring attention to matters of importance i.e. land mines. Years of a royal marriage had taught Diana how to manipulate the press to her advantage not Klan as the movie suggests. I'm sure Diana was neither a perfect saint  nor the completely selfish woman who is quoted in this movie saying ""I am a princess who gets what she wants "". Neither Hasnat Klan nor the actor who portrayed him in the movie is a ""gorgeous creature"" Diana couldn't resist.  I truly doubt Klan was a love-sick doctor who fought the crowds in order to leave flowers (along side the thousands left by the public) and a poem promising to find Diana in the after live. Diana, the movie, is an embarrassment for the actors, writers and producers.  If the idea was to portray Diana as a selfish woman who stalked  a man after he ended their relationship, then it was a success.

Too many uninteresting details, way too much kissee kissee and absolutely no relevant detail about her life growing up to give moviegoers a hint as to why she was so needy.

6086522,4,B00GM7STPI,"Do not watch this movie if you.....

* are looking for something historically factual about Diana's life ~ it is based loosely on events, but seems mainly fictional

* are hoping Naomi Watts looks a lot like Diana ~ she doesn't strongly resemble Diana, but she sounds like her at times

* want to see exact replicas of Diana's fabulous wardrobe ~ the clothes are similar, but not exact from what I could tell

* want to see sets that replicate Diana's rooms at Kensington Palace ~ the rooms in this movie aren't replicas - you can see actual images of Diana's rooms on pinterest, however

* are looking for something deep like the movie THE QUEEN ~ this doesn't have the same substance, but it did get you thinking about how lonely life was for Diana after the boys were in boarding school, Charles was with Camilla, and Diana can't go anywhere without being hounded by the ever-present press

I read the reviews which panned this film, so didn't expect much. I actually enjoyed the movie more than I expected. Sure, sometimes the dialogue sounded silly, but when you're in love, a lot of people sound silly, right? Prince William's phone was hacked and we learned he calls Kate 'babykins'. Wouldn't want anyone listening to my conversations. So, perhaps the dialogue was more like real life than we realize. You see how trapped Diana was by expectations, lack of privacy, the public's relentless interest in her every move, the royal family's jealousy of her, and lack of options to work or find meaning in a career like some do.

If you like Princess Diana, and would like to see a largely fictional imagining of a romance with the heart doctor and what that might have been like, you might enjoy this film more than some of the reviews suggest. The heart doctor was interviewed recently and said the movie didn't get their story accurately. The movie is light, and melodramatic, but it does provoke thought on how celebrity, and being royal, has equal lows accompanying the highs. 3.5 stars",1392163200,3,1993,4.677142857142857

I was not really into Diana when she was alive, never been a fan of keeping track of celebrities, but as an important figure you might think they were going to portrait her character with more sense, instead of filling her with some mindless, horrible, completely illogical script, that probably does not even come close to what really happen.

What upsets me is that this important role model of history has been ""dummy"" down to this mindless ""in love"" teenager who all that wants is love, stalks a guy, acts continuously like she was lost without him, sounds so immature and have 0 sense of reality and logic.

And where is the king in all the movie?",1392076800,2,694,4.5

6086536,1,B00GM7STPI,"There are good biographical movies. There are bad biographical movies. And there are biographical movies that rape the fabric of space-time with their wretchedness.

Guess what kind ""Diana"" is.

In fact, this seething drippy movie is not even a biographical piece -- it's more of a filmed fanfiction, allegedly about the late princess' affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (who hated this movie). Everything about ""Diana"" goes completely wrong, from Naomi Watts' breathy brainless performance to the driveling soap-opera script that seems more appropriate for the Lifetime Channel.

At the time of the film's beginning, Princess Diana (Watts) is pretty much at the end of her marriage to Prince Charles (Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Film) but is still loved and followed by everybody. Then she meets Khan (Naveen Andrews), whose devotion to saving lives immediately interests her -- and ""I'm a princess; I always get what I want.""

The two begin an affair, and Diana is dazzled by the normalcy of his life -- jazz, burgers, watching sports on TV, etc. And since Diana was a dazed ingenue with NO idea how to handle the press or her image, only Khan can coach her in how to use her celebrity for good. But the constant attention and paparazzi start to wear on their relationship, driving them apart -- and eventually, leading to tragedy.

Director Oliver Hirschbiegel is possibly the biggest Diana fanboy since EVER, and he presents the last years of her life like a bad romance novel. He bludgeons us with all sorts of sentimental glorifying garbage intermingled with a bad romantic plot. This is a Princess Di movie meant to appeal to people who already think she was a saint, and thus won't step on their toes.

After all, Diana was just SO down to earth that she took her shoes off in her house! And she never used the press for her own ends! No no, she was a wide-eyed ingenue who had NO idea that explosive interviews could cause trouble for the royals (""I don't do strategy""), or that she could use the press for her own ends! No, she was just so GENUINE and REAL and HONEST, and wanted a NORMAL life! Gag me.

It actually gets kind of nauseating to see him vomit the most transparent hype on the viewers. It doesn't help that he tries his best to emotionally manipulate the audience all the time, with revoltingly sappy scenes like Diana and Khan frolicking through a field or reciting poetry in bed.

And that's just the sappiness and emotional manipulation -- this movie is ghastly on every level of quality. Hirschbiegel wholeheartedly embraces every cliche that cinema has to offer -- when rejected by Khan, Diana responds by running tearfully through the night. And the dialogue is bad enough to burn holes in your eardrums -- for example, ""You don't perform the surgery. The surgery performs you"" (which caused me to blurt out, ""In Mother Russia, surgery performs YOU!"").

Naomi Watts was pretty much miscast from the beginning, and this is possibly her worst role to date -- her Diana is all breathy, doe-eyed innocent. And while Hirschbiegel demands that we admire her, he also attributes everything good that she ever did to Hasnat Khan. Ah, feminism.

But despite the fawning, she actually comes across as rather creepy, breaking into her lover's apartment to clean it, visiting his family and chasing him like a sex-changed Edward Cullen. Despite Hirschbiegel's depiction of her as a suffering saint, she comes across as a bratty, whiny teenager who wants a guy, refuses to care about his misgivings and goes psycho when rejected.

I'll credit Naveen Andrews -- he gives a semi-decent performance, considering the garbage he has to spew. Sadly, the movie is uninterested in the relationships that truly did shape Diana -- her children, her family, her ex-husband Charles, the repressive web of royals -- and they are reduced to nothing but fleeting shadows, without substance or voice.

Someday, someone will make a great biopic of Princess Diana... and hopefully, it will overshadow the cliched, fawning drivel in ""Diana."" Avoid at all costs.",1391904000,39,4059,4.909489051094891

A sweet sour film that is well filmed, nicely soundtracked, and totally unpretentious.

I was surprised by Naomi's stellar performance.  She is totally convincing.  The one thorn in the film is Naveen's acting which is just insipid.
