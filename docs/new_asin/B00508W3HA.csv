8450878,1,B00508W3HA,"The movie is based sole on the fictions hype of Lois Lee, the founder and executive director of CON. CON started out as CAT, which stood for the California Association of Trollops, which actually supported prostitution and wanted to legalize or at least decriminalize it. CON's notoriety came from their partnering with Hugh Hefner and Playboy. Most recently, Lee published a letter online, defending BackPage against the government, which ordered it to remove its prostitution section, which Lee claimed was helping law enforcement rescue underage girls from sex trafficking. My guess is that Lee has made far more in her CON salary over the years than the movie ever grossed. When Thursday's Child was founded back in 1982, CON ""suggested"" we disband, because it would compete with their fundraising. What eventuated after that was nothing short of ruthless on their part. Watch the movie if you must, but take all the ""facts"" with a truckload of salt.",1502582400,,954,5.082802547770701

I watched this movie in the 90s in the Children of the Night shelter In Van Nuys, Ca where Dr Lois Lee still rescues children today.  Very cool to see the movie and have Dr Lois narrate it, tell us what was going thru her head at the time. This had a lasting effect on me. She started off writing her college thesis on teenage prostitution, and wound up helping children all over the world. She still does to this day. A truly worthy cause you can still donate to today, and be a part of. We could all take a lesson from Dr Lee. Amazing woman, amazing story.",1491264000,2,614,4.203389830508475
