2511804,5,B000EAT23C,"Why do all good things have to come to an end??!! It's not fair!!  I am going to miss Dawson's Creek soooo much!!  It has been such a big part of my teenage life and the thought of not being able to follow the journeys of Joey, Pacey, Jack, Jen and Dawson makes me sooo upset!!  But the final episode was just perfect! All the actors really gave it their all, and I now have a new-found respect for Kerr and Michelle, they really did an amazing job and I still cry everytime I watch their scenes together!

Josh and Katie are always amazing, I love the show so much mostly because I love watching the chemistry they share on screen.  I love how they used to go out in real life, it kinda makes watching them more exciting!

The whole season is definatly my second favourite (after Season 3).  If Pacey wasn't in the picture I think Eddie would have been a good boyfriend for Joey, but I'm happy to say that Pacey is still very very much in the picture!!!!  'Castaways' has definatly got to be one of my all time favourite episodes!!

It is sooo sad to think that I will never be able to see Josh and Katie act side by side together ever again........here's to praying they bring out 'Dawson's Creek the movie'!! (WISHFUL THINKING, HUH?!)

Special thanks goes out to all the episode writers over the years, thank you so much for creating these wonderful stories for the characters we have grown to love!  It's been a great 6 years!",1142985600,14,1430,4.338345864661654
2511805,4,B000EAT23C,"Ok, so there were admittedly a few flaws - like we barely see Dawson...but by the 6th season his droning on and on and over analysis are a bit annoying anyway. And I miss seeing the Jack/Jen combo as much as before.  They work so well together.  I liked the new characters. Audrey (introduced in the 5th season) I thought annoying at first, but I really ended up liking her character...though it was disappointing that they made her go crazy (kind of like Andy...hmm...the Dawson's Creek way of getting rid of people - make them go nuts). But Andy really was a sucky actress, where Audrey was not (she was ceaselessly peppy and had the party girl attitude down to a T, but don't we all know people like that?). Eddie I just loved and I thought he and Joey fit really well together.  I would have been happy with her ending up with him or w/Pacey - thank God for a good ending!! Overall Dawson's Creek is amazing b/c I have similar situations occur in everyday life where I think ""wow, this is SO Dawson's Creek"" - every moment is worth it.  I only wish there were more seasons...I miss the innocent, sweet Katie Holmes...pre-brainwashing.",1142812800,16,1138,4.509708737864078
2511806,5,B000EAT23C,This is the best show in the world.  Its a big soap about how teeenagers grow up and learn together.  I own every single episode on DVD.  I truly recommend Dawson's Creek to you.,1142726400,5,178,4.176470588235294
2511807,5,B000EAT23C,I LOVE THIS SHOW ITS MY FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL TIME I LOVED HOW THEY PUT JOEY AND PACEY BACK TOGEATHER THEY HAVE SUCH A GREAT CHEMISTRY THEY ARE MY FAVORITE COUPLE ON THE SHOW AND IF U LOVED SEASON 6 LIKE I DID THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINATLY BUY THE SEASON FINALE ITS ANOTHER GREAT FAVORITE OF MINE.......BUY EVERY SEASON LIKE ME .......,1141862400,8,330,4.253968253968254
2511808,4,B000EAT23C,"Season 6 was a giant step up from season 5, particularly in the second half of the season when the show returned to form.  Dawson is largely absent the whole season and has totally isolated storylines the majority of time.  Things really pick up midway through when Pacey and Joey finally get together again.  this is good as Holmes and Jackson have more chemistry together than all the other couples in the show combined.  Show #615 ""Castaways"" is probably the most well written and enjoyable episode of the series run when Joey and Pacey get locked inside a K-Mart overnight.  ...The season finale is also an amazing ending.  would recommend.",1140912000,25,644,4.8090909090909095
2511809,5,B000EAT23C,"Anyone who watches Dawson Creek can appreciate this ending season of a forever beloved and unforgetable show!

I watched this show from day one and realized then and there that this was going to be an amazing show. This season had to do a lot with the realities of life that is not always the perfect seaside romance. I found it kind of nice to have a break from the Joey/Dawson dynamic and I think we all got to see what they each had to offer seperatly.

Everyone who likes this show or has never seen it should buy this as well as all the seasons, I think you'll find it is an amazing show as well as entertaining.

This show will always be a beloved memory and I hope a great  memory for many others who loved and cherished watching this unforgetable show every week. This is the end of something I will never forget. :)

BUY IT AND ENJOY :)",1140566400,7,845,4.191358024691358
2511810,3,B000EAT23C,"I watched Dawson's Creek on and off during its initial run on the WB.  I picked up the DVDs as they started releasing to see what I missed and be able to appreciate it now that I'm older.  It has become one of my favorite shows because of its realistic characters. (Despite the obvious disagreements on that, I did/do know people with the similar quirks, manners, drama and flaws.  So I can relate to it.

I recently was able to view Season 6 in its entirety since they air it in syndication on the TBS network.  And I was mildly disappointed with how the events were playing out.  It definitely wasn't a shadow of the show in its former years.  While I do understand the characters must grow, etch out their own paths in life, and have experiences outside the bubble of Capeside, it seemed very forced and despondant.  It did lack the depth and intimacy I believe the show had conveyed before.

Firstly, I was never a fan of Busy Phillips' ""Audrey"", the Audrey/Pacey relationship, and most of the drama that entailed.  However the writer's decision to have her completely lose her mind wasn't entertaining or thought-provoking.  It always seemed to me that she was the ""Jen"" replacement in New York when Jen mellowed out and matured.  It made the already lacking character deteriorate into the cliche, troubled rich brat with a drug/drinking problem.

The introduction of Oliver Hudson's ""Eddie"" was necessary.  In all fairness, Joey Potter has been obsessing over her childhood loves for years and it's only natural that she should be allowed to explore other avenues.  The love triangle between Joey, Dawson, and Pacey was growing very stale.  It was time for her to view life on her own.  Which is to say I do not have any disagreements with the events that transpired in I believe the first episode of this season between Dawson and Joey.  It gave some much needed closure on that tension that had been brewing for years.  As for Eddie, he was a great character that was wasted.  I thought in my opinion that he shared a great chemistry with Joey, much like that she had with Pacey.

The only bright moment was when they managed to rekindle the Joey/Pacey attraction, no matter how short lived it seemed.  They had both changed considerably since their failed romance in the past and it proved that they weren't just explosive anymore.  It gave some much needed warmth and tenderness as opposed to the perpetual angst that followed whatever inclination she felt toward Dawson.  As for Dawson, you barely saw him interact with his Capeside friends since he was out on the other coast doing his filmmaking thing and dating snobby, insecure actresses like Natasha.  I thought Jen and Jack were left incredibly short changed this season. They could infuse this slightly bitter enviroment with some sharp wit and humor after a life lesson slapped them in the face.

Overall, I feel Season 6 was bland.  It was not particularly great or bad.  Luckily, the Series Finale can be purchased on its own and isn't included with Season 6.  This is excellent because there was truly no better way to finish this series.  Kevin Williamson came back to pen the Series Finale so naturally it fit like a glove and gave you the much needed satisfaction that Season 6 may have left you wanting.  If you're an avid fan of Dawson's Creek like I am, you will want to purchase Season 6 mainly to complete your collection.",1140566400,12,3402,4.686340640809443
2511811,1,B000EAT23C,"I remember watch the first episode of Dawsons creek many years ago feeling like a new vision from the Rob Reiner's classic Stand By Me. It was the ultimate show for theyoung people, good actors, wonderfull stories, beautifull places unforgetable moments.

Now it comes the worst thing that coul ever happend: season 6

Everything in this season is wrong(except the very last episode from Kevin Williams) the characters change boyfriends and girlfriends like coins in a store, Busy Phillips it's just another annoying actress trying to show talent who doesn't have in a character who never fits in the show like Andie (Meredith Monroe a lost jewel).

I try many times to watch this season but it was unbearable. Even the first version of the last episode had so many mistakes (including the brainless idea of the granma's boyfriend, the last minute solution to show who much the character change instead to use another deep theme).

The only good thing of this season you can buy it separately in the last episode written and directed by Kevin Williams, it's not perfect but fits better than the rest of the season.",1140480000,7,1114,4.847368421052631
2511812,2,B000EAT23C,"Season 6 was a joke. For lack of a better way of saying it. This season Dawson's Creek lost what was important, the relationships between the four lead characters. This season features little in the way of interaction between Dawson, Jenn, Pacey, and Joey. The interaction that is missed the most is that between Dawson and Joey. The two finally sleep together in the opening episode, one of the best of the series, but it all goes down hill from there, and after about the fifth episode the two have little or no interaction.

Dawson's character spends most of the season not even with the other characters. He spends it in LA working on his movie career. The other characters continue their lives in Boston. Joey has a new fling with the character of Eddie. Eddie (played by Oliver Hudson) was a excellent character, but I never felt chemistry between he and Holmes. Jack's relationship comes and goes, while Pacey and Audrey self distruct. Another major dissapointment of this season was the writers urge to make Audrey go so nuts. That said it did provide for some funny moments during the Christmas episode. It just really destoryed a character that was so great for no reason. Her and Pacey made a great couple and in my opinion should have ended the show together, but instead Mid-season the writers decided to throw us back in to the old Joey-Pacey love story. To me this made little sense at all. Their story line had been resovled quite nicely during the fifth season, and during this season with no forshadowing of any kind the writers just throw us back in to their relationship. The two spend a night in a K-mart and all their old feelings just come back. This is the set up for Joey ""shocking"" the world with her decision at the end of the series. Jenn begins a relationship with a character named C.J. (played by Jensen Ackles). By the series finale the storyline is never resloved and people are left wondering at the end of the series, ""What went wrong?""

I just found this season very all over the place and not really to be much of a Dawson's Creek season. If anything this season shows us what a Joey Potter spin-off would have been like.

And then there are the music changes. I don't particularly mind the music changes for this particular season. The original music selected for this particular season was pretty crappy to begin with, so any music changes will probably be welcomed.

All in all, if your a fan of the show you have to watch this season. For better or worse it is the end of a legacy. It is just too bad the show didn't go out with the magic of the fourth or fifth season, instead it went out on a low note.",1139616000,10,2645,4.492723492723493

2511830,5,B000EAT23C,"Love this whole series.  Thought I wouldn't like this season after they left Capeside and hearing complaints about the music but one of my favorite seasons after the first few episodes.  I'm not young but loved this series and the ending was on target.  Obviously Pacey and Joey had the chemistry in this series and the Castaway and Sex and Violence episodes demonstrated this once again.  Loved the irony that Pacey and Joey couldn't stand each other in the beginning and became the great love of each others life.  The irony also that Joey so badly wanted to leave Capeside but in the end she realized she already had what made her happy right there all the time.  Art imitates life.  Also while one romanticizes about first love sometimes it right and sometimes it's not.and writers chose not to be predictable.  Loved the sub stories that marriage is hard and takes work but if you weather the storms it can be very rewarding,  old people have experience if the young are willing to listen,  and old people can find love and enjoy life.  This series had great dialogue and writing although unfortunately I don't run into many teenagers that talk in that manner.  Probably would not have bought this if Pacey and Joey had not ended up together. Jackson and Holmes were great throughout the series as was most of the cast.",1451260800,4,1324,4.6594827586206895

2511895,3,B000EAT23C,"I am going to copy and paste this in every season of Dawson's Creek. Understand I am a fan of 90210 the originals series, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, NCIS, The 100, Utopia, Bones, Continuum just to name a few. I ordered all 6 seasons of Dawson's Creek and began watching them. I understand this is an old T.V. series and I am playing catch up, but there is a reason I have never heard of this show. Pros I enjoy watching shows with the ins and outs of growing up and all the pain it brings, this show does that to a certain extent. The show also brings into light some of the pains homosexual kids face when growing up. Now for the Cons. At best this show was nothing more than a copy cat of 90210 as a matter of fact 90210 was actually mentioned in the show. You will also notice that you can skip a season or two and never truly miss anything.  You know when you sit down and start watching a bad movie but you force yourself through it hoping that it gets good soon ""I found myself in this very situation on more then one occasion"". The love triangle between the three main characters killed the series for me, much like the first couple of seasons of the Vampire Diaries. However, the Vampire Diaries had a story behind each show outside of the love triangle that somewhat held it together. The story line always came second to the love triangle in Dawson's Creek and for the most part the story lines were garbage. Some more bad news for the show; you would be hard pressed to find one 15 year old in high school with a vocabulary of a 30 year old English professor, but not in this show they all do. If it weren't for the last season 2 stars at best.  I recommend this series only if you have time to waste.",1425081600,,1717,4.2

The characters were fully formed and ready for resolution, storylines were wrapping and Capeside seemed ready to close the curtain.
The dialogue was still snappy and no character had lost their voice. This was a proper sendoff for Kevin Williamson's creation.

2511936,3,B000EAT23C,"I never missed an episode of DC doing S1-S4, but I stopped watching it as much after the fourth season. High School shows usually go downhill after HS and that's what happened to ""Dawson's Creek."" The gang went to college and the show lost it's appeal. Doing the original airing of S5-S6 I could not tell you what was happening because I barely watched it. I did watch the 2 hour series finale when it aired. I re watched S5 & S6 recently. Dawson is missed for a lot of S6 and that was all James' doing. When he is around, he's not hanging with the old gang. He spends a lot of his time with his director friend, Todd and his[Dawson] actress girlfriend. Since S2 I've always found a lot of the new characters they introduce for one season to be boring. C.J. is boring. Jensen 100x better on SPN. Eddie is boring. Emma is boring. I liked Audrey in S5, but in S6 she becomes very unlikable until the final episodes of the season. Dawson and Joey finally do the deed and it's unsexy and boring like the rest of their romantic relationship. They finally break up for good this season. After their one night stand, they're over once Joey finds out he had a girlfriend back in L.A. He broke up with his girlfriend over the answering machine before he slept with Joey. Dawson and Joey do not share many scenes together after the break up. Audrey and Pacey's relationship comes crashing down in S6. They were cute in S5, but I never believed they actually loved each other. It was more of a sex thing. Most of the episodes are pretty boring until Episode 14 ""Clean and Sober."" Pacey and Jack throw a house party and what a party it is! Pacey and Joey come back together in this episode. Then comes ""Castaways,"" TWT, SAV and LB. The show finally felt like DC again.  PJ break up in LB, but it's an awesome episode regardless. I will not call it a bad episode because of the ending. That's silly and so not me. LB and CA are two of the best episodes of the series. Carolla makes LL funny. C22 is good, but Pacey and Dawson have another big fall out because Pacey loses Dawson's money for his movie. Pacey comes clean in the next episode GBYBR. JPACR is a really nice episode leading us into the series finale. Joey gets everyone together to help raise money for Dawson's movie. Pacey goes out on his own and raises money for the movie. He then gives the money to Dawson. At the end Joey finally goes to freaking Paris, France! The 2 part series finale comes next and it's amazing. A beautiful way to end the show.

2512021,4,B000EAT23C,"Spoilers ahead: Season Six is a must have for all fans because it brings the characters full circle. Dawson gets his chance on a real movie set, and in the end, his own TV show (aptly titled, The Creek). Pacey and Joey finally get together, Jack finds true love in his partner (Doug, Pacey's brother), and Jen dies of cancer. Some of these results, I might not have chosen myself, but they are reasonable conclusions. They begin this final season in their second year of college and the finale is set 5 years into the future. Odd, perhaps, but a useful tool.

The only reason I give Season 6 a rating a 4 instead of 5 is because I felt that the characters of Season 6 were just not up to snuff. I loved Audrey, but was disappointed that they threw her in a mental hospital. I really liked Audrey and felt that she really added to the ensemble. When they took her out of it, it felt flat. I was also disappointed with Eddie, Joey's final romantic interest before ultimately going back to Pacey. He's completely boring and you don't really see why she likes him to begin with.

If you're a DC fan, you must own this one. It's very interesting to see how these characters have grown.",1171238400,,1180,4.359090909090909

You think Tom Cruise ever seen her show before, even if he did.  He probably die hard fan right now.  Katie Holmes came from a long way from before being Mrs. Tom Cruise, she's always going to be Joey Potter the girl next door that she had a crush on Dawson.",1164067200,,545,4.41
2512033,2,B000EAT23C,"i hadn't seen all of these episodes when they aired--nor all of seasons 4 or 5, as my interest/obsession waned after the crew went to college--so it was worth it to me to be able to view them all in full.  HOWEVER, they aren't very good and i very much doubt that i will watch them again and again over time the way i might the first 3 seasons.

the final two-part episode is an exception but if one wanted, one COULD buy that episode alone on DVD.
the creators took the helm back for the series finale and it focuses on our original 4-5 characters (5 if you include jack), leaving out audrey and others, which i for one VERY MUCH appreciated.  although to me they already had enough of an acceptable reason and to reunite everyone in capeside (five years in the future) and enough material w/which to surprise us (and tie up some loose ends) all in a nice melodramatic/comedic fashion WITHOUT *killing another character off*. (after both abbey and mitch met accidental deaths in earlier seasons, i feel like it gets to be a bit much--but at least this time, there's a believable--although rarely occurring--medical cause.)

at least joey ended up with the right guy (in my not-so-humble opinion).

basically, if you're a committed dawson's (err, joey's ;-) creek fan and want to collect the whole set, you'll want to purchase this season.  otherwise, though, you might consider skipping it and maybe buying the series finale separately.

also, special features were sorely lacking.  this set marked the end of one of the WB's most successful shows that launched acting careers for several young people; the least they could have done is include behind-the-scenes interviews with cast/crew!  creator commentary on the last episode just doesn't cut it.",1162512000,3,1751,4.81

I loved the series and was sad to see them finish it - although by then I was probably a little old to be publicly noting I enjoyed the show. I missed the last episode when it aired on TV so getting Season 6 was very exciting for me to complete my series. The show ended on a high and the final episodes I believe completed the circle that the characters where walking. The DVD's are all excellent quality and the extras are just a very welcome added bonus for any DC fan to enjoy and remenice. If you are or were a DC fan I truly recommend you add this to your collection- this show is timeless like Happy days and other similar shows that have aired through the age of TV about teenages and the struggles of life.

I grew up with this show and I was deeply affected by how they would pick out songs with lyrics that matched the scene that was happening.  The music was a strong focus of mine for this show and to change over most of the catalog was entirely disappointing.  I have also read that they do not intend on ever releasing a collection with all the original music due to legal reasons.  So I have no intention of owning this collection again, which is a shame, since I adored this show.  You can still catch re-runs on TV, though, and I would recommend, if sampling this show, to catch the high school episodes as opposed to the college episodes.  The writing is better in the high school episodes and the characters are more enjoyable, especially Pacey, (my favorite).

If you put as much stock in the music of this show as I have, I would not suggest purchasing these DVD sets.",1151539200,5,930,4.4035087719298245
2512037,5,B000EAT23C,"All good things must come to an end. That sentence, divided in two, was the title of the two-hour series finale of Dawson's Creek, which aired at the end of the show's sixth season, ending a show that helped to bring about the rise of the WB as a television network.

Season six picks up not long after where season five left off, with Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) back at Worthington, Dawson Leery (James Van der Beek) working for a director in Los Angeles, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson) returning to the east coast after a summer on the road with his girlfriend Audrey Liddell (Busy Phillips). Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams) and Jack McPhee (Kerr Smith) return for another year at Boston Bay College, and as the season begins, they are both still living with Jen's Grams (Mary Beth Piel).

Things certainly change pretty quickly for a number of the young adults who viewers watched grow up on the creek for the previous five seasons. Joey finds herself involved with a gentleman from one of her classes, who as it turns out, doesn't actually go to school at her college, but simply sits in on the classes, while working at a bar nearby. Of course, Joey ends up working at the bar/restaurant, Hell's Kitchen. Joey's new boyfriend Eddie (guest star Oliver Hudson) eventually heads to California for writer's school, but returns for a few final moments with Joey. Joey and Dawson continue to have a cold spell after their ill-fated hooking early in the season, but come to realize their friendship for each other is something that can't be denied.

Dawson enjoys his experience working with movie director Todd Carr (guest star Hal Oskan) and gets an opportunity to be a director when parts of the movie need to be reshot. He also gets a chance to make his dream movie, but backs out when the people in charge want to change the entire script. He dates a Hollywood starlet (guest star Bianca Kajlich), which leads to his riff with Joey. He also entrusts all his money to Pacey in an attempt to make his movie, and when Pacey's plan backfires, his friendship with Dawson is tested.

Pacey began the season dating Audrey, but her eventual slide into trouble spelled trouble for the pair. While Pacey got a job (thanks to Audrey's dad) selling stocks, Audrey fell deeper into trouble with drugs and alchohol, eventually leading to her having to head back out west to enter rehab. She also gets her first chance to sing, when a friend's band takes her on as a vocalist. Pacey finds out he is very good at his job and makes a lot of money, but when his hot stock fails, he loses everything, including his friendship with Dawson.

Jen meets CJ (guest star Jensen Ackles) who she pursues until the two finally become an item midway through the season. She volunteers with him at the college help line and even gets to host a benefit session of Lovelines with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew, where everyone's love lives are out for the world to see, including hers and CJs. She also has to join her Grams as the show's matriarchal figure battles cancer.

Jack finds new love with David (guest star Greg Rikaart), a friend of CJs and they also have their problems, which like Jen's, get aired on the Lovelines benefit. Jack and Pacey end up sharing an apartment with Emma (guest star Meghan Gray), who also happens to work with Joey and Eddie at Hell's Kitchen.

As the sixth season draws to a close (in the episode prior to the finale), Joey gets the gang together to help Dawson make his movie after he loses all his money. The independent film he made helped him to land the gig viewers find him in when the finale comes around.

In the finale, which takes place five years in the future, Dawson is the executive producer for a WB show entitled ""The Creek"" essentially mocking the show itself. Jen is a single mother in New York, while Jack is back in Capeside teaching and dating Pacey's brother Doug (guest star Dylan Neal), who Pacey always teased about being gay, though he never was revealed that way until the finale. Joey is an editor with a publishing company in New York, while Pacey owns and operates the Icehouse Restaurant in Capeside, the place that used to be owned by Joey's family.

The gang reunites in Capeside for Dawson's mom's (guest star and former series regular Mary-Margaret Humes) wedding, where the group learns some startling news about Jen, Dawson gets to rewrite history through his television show and Joey finally chooses Pacey and they settle into their lives together, watching The Creek each Wednesday at 8 p.m.

It was obvious from the writing of the finale that creator Kevin Williamson returned to the show for that one episode. The finale was well done and well thought out and Williamson and producer Paul Stupin give a good commentary for the two-hour episode. The finale wrapped things up in a solid way, with everyone's loose ends seeming to be tied up, with Dawson getting his meeting with Spielberg and Joey and Pacey winding up together. The issue of whether Joey would choose Dawson or Pacey was one that divided fans of the show for six years, but I believe the choice was the correct one, though Williamson admits that he went back and forth when writing the finale.

Throughout the season, former series regulars Humes and Nina Repeta (who played Joey's sister Bessie), make appearances, as well as guest stars Mika Boorem, Taylor Handley (Oliver on The O.C.), Lukas Behnken (Topher on Everwood), Mimi Rogers and Jamie Bergman.

In addition to the finale commentary, the extras include a great booklet highlighting moments from the show and the characters that the actors created. This was a great addition to the set and I was happy to see it included.

Also, it was nice to hear the original theme song again, though just for one episode. Up until the finale, all the episodes featured the Jann Arden tune ""Run Like Mad"" over the credits, while the finale featured Paula Cole's ""I Don't Wanna Wait."" I imagine this was possible because the finale had been previously released on DVD and I am sure the company had already paid for its use on this episode. Either way, it was nice to hear it again.

This season set was a solid way to end the Dawson's Creek DVD series and the show itself provided good closure on a six-year run.",1150156800,35,6266,4.648599819331527

Joey and Pacey are perrrfect for each other and I am so glad se didn't end up with Dawson (I never really did like him). Anyway, I cried when the final show was over and miss the show with all my heart. Atleast I have the seasons they did get through.

  PS...Josh and Katie should have stayed together in real  life because TomKat isn't really working for me.",1145318400,,508,4.101010101010101
2512040,2,B000EAT23C,No wonder they stopped at season 6.  It was incredibly boring and pointless.  What was the point of audrey?  she has no talent whatsoever and Joey really got on my nerves this season.  I think she should have been the one to die in the end.  Why were Dawson and Pacey so in love with her?  She's not that great looking!!!  I only watched this because I wanted to see the very last episode which was another dissapointment.  The only cool thing about this  whole season was when Jack and the cop got together.,1145232000,4,508,4.319148936170213
2512041,4,B000EAT23C,"Season 6 of Dawson's Creek is finally HERE. I already have seasons 1-5, so I knew that I was going to get this one. I love this show. It is one of my favorites.

THe only reason why I gave this season a 4 out of 5 stars is because of the very first episode. It is my all time favorite episode of this show, and their music changing ruined one of my favorite parts:

Dawson and Joey are sitting at the bar in ""Hell's Kitchen"" and Joey had been waiting for a song to come on. She had been waiting all night and before Dawson can tell Joey about his summer, the song finally comes on. They dance to it, and it is a great transistion into their ""unforgettable"" night.

The reason why the music changing of this made me mad is because they changed the SONG that Joey was talking about. They should have kept that song. It is one of my favorite moments and they got rid of the song that defines it.

If you don't know what I'm talking about, the song should have been ""As I Lay Me Down"" by Sophie B. Hawkins, and instead they put in a song called ""Love Will Lead Us Home"". The song that they put in does work, but it is just not the same and it really made me mad.

Besides that, this is a great season that I thought was an awesome send-off to Dawson's Creek, and now I have all 6 seasons. YAY",1144281600,8,1288,3.9961089494163424

8107980,5,B000EAT23C,"This series seems to be very honest about the activities and angst of the portrayed age group. I'm not sure that I liked one of the main characters dying in this season. I did like the addition of Jensen Ackles as a major character, even though he evidently was the father of Jen's baby!",1482624000,,287,4.333333333333333

8107984,1,B000EAT23C,The ending is horrible pacey and Joey again! Boring...  Dawson barely talks to his best friend pacey or jack. and Eddie and Joey were the best couple ever and the writers totally ruined that storyline! Dawson and Joey finally sleep together and break up in the next episode again horrible writing! No extras or interviews with the cast or original music. Except we get to hear Paul stupin who was a horrible executive producer who hired all these useless writers and approved these laughable storylines. And kevin Williamson on the commentary all he talks about is how he had to rush the finale and had no time to write the ending. Well thanks kevin for ruining the magic of the show if you had brains pacey should be with andy and Joey with Eddie and Dawson with jen. Now we are stuck with this ending forever thanks Paul stupin or should i say Paul stupid.,1464307200,,858,4.535483870967742
