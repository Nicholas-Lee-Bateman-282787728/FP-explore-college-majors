8193782,5,B00083AXD8,"Where's the love?  Utah Utes, then Mountain West Conference champions, first NAQ team to bust the BCS & be invited to a top bowl game.  Thank you Fiesta Bowl!  Unfortunately, the opponent was no match for the highly ranked Utes & thus the game was a blow out.  It was great fun for the Ute fans, a good time for the players & a significant achievement for the ""U"" football & athletics departments. This DVD captured history & so it opened the doors to recognize some of the best teams in the smaller conferences. . .",1312588800,,516,4.34375
