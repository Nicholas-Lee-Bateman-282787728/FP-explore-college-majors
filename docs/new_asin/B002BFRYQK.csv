8361319,5,B002BFRYQK,"My mother told me stories of her childhood in Glasgow, of the bitter divisions between Catholics and Protestants, of poverty and getting a few pence and an orange for Christmas, of the fairs, the hard work on the docks, I could go on and on. Altho this is set in Newcastle, it has the same gritty feeling. You get a real sense of the day to day life and if you love the Northern accent and all the slang you'll get a big kick out of this movie. Noo I'm not daft as a brush! The actors are all great in this ( catch 'Bubbles' from Absolutely Fabulous in a serious role! ) and of course Sean Bean as my mother would say "" Plays a real bugger! """,1426809600,2,642,3.9844961240310077
8361320,5,B002BFRYQK,"Set in North East England, this is one of my favorite Catherine Cookson stories. I had it in VHS at least for 10 years and decided I better get it in DVD.
Story about working class people struggling to make it and a working man falls for a woman who comes from the privileged class.
A lot of family dynamics in the downtrodden area where this story is set.",1411948800,,356,4.173913043478261
