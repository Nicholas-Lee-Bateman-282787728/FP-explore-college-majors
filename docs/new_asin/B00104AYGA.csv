3045870,5,B00104AYGA,"Tremendous documentary. Interviews with Annik Honore (finally!), Tony Wilson (and not someone playing Tony Wilson), and all of the surviving band members (Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris, & Peter Hook) plus Buzzcock Pete Shelley and Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon, plus music journalist and Joy Division biographer Paul Morley, plus album designer Peter Saville ... this is really a goldmine for Joy Division fans. Truly, an overwhelming amount of detailed information here. Even if you think you've heard it all, stories become more than just talk when told by someone who was actually there. Plus loads of vintage footage of the band performing in various venues. More than I knew existed.

Interestingly enough the documentary starts off with a quote, that I found to be quite compelling:

To be modern is to find ourselves in an environment that promises us adventure, power, joy, growth, transformation of ourselves and the world--and at the same time that threatens to destroy everything we have, everything we know, everything we are.

--Marshall Berman, All That is Solid Melts Into Air

This will give you some indication that this is not your typical rock documentary that recounts the rise and fall of yet another generic rock band. This is a rock documentary that is completley different from any that you have seen before, and that is fitting given the subject matter. Manchester, we learn, was in many ways the first modern city. And Joy Division, in many ways was creatively inspired (if that is the right word) by the fact that they lived in a purely utilitarian city designed to maximize economic efficiency. (Bernard Sumner mentions, almost in passing, that he never saw a tree until he was nine.) If Control was primarily a story about a marriage, then Grant Gee's ""Joy Division"" is about a place and a time: Manchester in the late seventies. This sounds ambitious, and it is, but Gee succeeds brilliantly in giving us an idea of where those mysterious Joy Division sounds & visions were coming from. This is a documentary that attempts to contextualize a band that dared to be culturally significant, and does so in a culturally significant way.

Manchester is both cerebrally & viscerally unique and this is a documentary that strikes to the core of how Joy Division processed the environment that became so much a part of their music. One might almost say that this is a documentary with two subjects: Joy Division & Manchester. Grant Gee certainly has a point of view here, and many of those interviewed here seem to share the belief that there is a ""psychogeographic"" (at least two of them use that very word) link between the time and the place it was made & the Joy Division sound. This is maybe not a surprising observation to make for it seems obvious that we are all, to a certain extent, products of our environment, but rarely has this oft thought axiom been so well expressed, and few, I suspect, have explored it more thoroughly than Ian Curtis.

This documentary is, in short, everything that Control was not.

It is full of substantial insight.

The most insightful and revealing and moving interview is the Annik Honore interview. She is a very delicate, very sensitive creature, and also one with a very refined sensibility. When she discusses Ian's stage presence and how he transformed into another kind of person onstage it is haunting and one feels that she among all that knew him, knew & understood him best.

The surviving Joy Division, now New Order, band members are surprisingly upbeat. Each of them breaks into laughter very easily when discussing the past. Apparently, the band shied away from playing Joy Division songs until recently.

One particularly memorable moment is when Sumner plays a tape of Ian Curtis answering questions under hypnosis. Sumner asks him to remember a time before he was born and then asks him what he is doing. Ian responds that he is reading books about the law. This is a hauntingly Kafkaesque moment.

Even though producer Martin Hannett (who produced both the Buzzcocks & Joy Division) died many years ago (1991, I believe), he is present here in spirit as each of the band members remembers Hannett's highly unorthodox studio practices; his ""zen"" method of production as one band member puts it. Hook has been quoted as saying that Hannett is responsible for the Joy Division sound, but he seems to retract that here as he insists that although Hannett made many adjustments to the sound, he didn't write the songs. I think an entire documentary could well be dedicated to Hannett. Music journalist Paul Morley, in his book on Joy Division, states that Hannett is the kind of guy that could have heard the sound of the moon passing round the earth.

Manager, and co-founder of Factory records and the Hacienda, Rob Gretton (who died in 1999) is also remembered. On several occasions Grant Gee silently pans the many pages of Gretton's notebooks full of phone numbers, carefully calculated expenditures, events and plans, some of which came to pass, and some of which did not.

Also memorable: An always lively Tony Wilson discussing a night that he was to give a lecture, and after listening to the previous speaker (Richard Florida) go on about creative communities, deciding to talk about death.

I recently saw Control & was disappointed that so much of the film was spent on the marriage (which makes sense as it was based on Deborah Curtis' biography). But this documentary tells the story that Control did not tell. In fact Deborah does not even appear in this documentary. (Deborah is represented only by a few written quotes.) While Control was Ian & Deborah's story (as Deborah saw it), this documentary is about the whole group & Manchester & music.

Extras: DVD includes the entirety of the Joy Division performance of ""Transmission"" on the SO IT GOES show. Plus loads of interview extras that take as much time to watch as the actual film, including discussions of everything from WWII (Morris calls it ""the first big spin"") to synthesizers (Sumners built the first one the band used).

If Control was the populist Joy Division project, this documentary is the thinking mans Joy Division project.

3045896,3,B00104AYGA,"Never gave much thought to the band Joy Division, and my only frame of reference was the film ""24 Hour Party People."" So, I'm grateful for being enlightened via this DVD to the music Joy Division produced with the very talented, albeit distressed Ian Curtis. What really surprised me was how much this story parallels the Pink Floyd saga. You know, anguished lead singer/heart throb - Ian Curtis/Syd Barrett - achieves short and stunning creative leaps, hits the wall hard, and their respective bandmates basically keep on driving, without so much as a backward glance.

Liked the geographical backdrop, that being post industrial Manchester. Living in the Bronx, couldn't believe how much Manchester reminded me of the worst part of our hood here, the South Bronx. Seriously decaying and grim. All members of the band (sans Curtis of course) contribute their memories. Would have liked more concert or TV appearances to have been included. As another reviewer commented, this could have been a lot better. Also, Joy Division was a great band, but testimonials from people in their orbit (don't miss the way out and weird Genesis P-Orridge formerly of Throbbing Gristle by the way) sound like stories of the second coming.

That said, what strongly grated was the total lack of empathy shown for Ian Curtis by his fellow band members. Are these people emotionally challenged or something? For example, bassist Peter Cook recounts how the authorities phoned his home as he was getting ready to eat Sunday afternoon dinner. Scotland Yard informs him that Ian Curtis had killed himself. Does Peter Hook get upset or go into shock? No, he just grins widely and says ""OK, Ian Curtis killed himself,"" then sits down to eat his dinner. No hair off of his back.  Do you think you could eat a meal after hearing such dire news? I know I couldn't. Found it extremely offensive. The drummer, Steven Morris, gets POed when Ian Curtis dies, because basically that was screwing with his career, man, and that was same attitude with Nick Mason of Floyd about Syd Barrett's difficulties. Even more appalling was when the interviewer puts this question to lead guitarist Bernard Sumner: ""So what do you think of the lyrics?""  Without missing a beat, Mr. Sumner shrugs and answers ""Didn't give much thought to the lyrics."" In actuality, Ian Curtis, doomed with the horrible combo of bipolarity and epilepsy, was a tortured soul, and his lyrics were bleak and black. So, while he was on stage pouring his heart out, there beside him all along was guitarist Bernard Sumner, but he wasn't EVEN LISTENING!  Obliviously, the lead guitarist damns his own self on film.  Dumb and dumber:  Peter Hook, Steven Morris, Bernard Sumner, all still totally without a clue.

Another Floyd parallel, after the demise of Ian Curtis, Joy Division morphed into New Order and enjoyed huge success with their keyboard driven/techno ditties. However, without Ian Curtis at the helm their music had a fraction of its former depth, and their live act lost one of the more bizarre stage presences ever. In the end, this documentary is definitely interesting and holds your attention throughout, but it does leaves a distinctly sour aftertaste.",1363046400,7,3200,4.968224299065421
3045897,5,B00104AYGA,"Essential viewing for the Joy Division/ New Order fan.

The film is a thorough discussion on the history of the band from the humble beginnings in a bleak Manchester through the death of Ian Curtis. It's as official as can be with candid contributions from all the remaining members, Tony Wilson, Paul Morley, etc.

As complete as it is it does not demystify the legacy of Joy Division for me.

This has become part of my Joy Division collection. It has a place for me right alongside Closer, Unknown Pleasures, and Substance. Sometimes when I want a fix of Joy Division I pop on this film and get taken away all over again... have gotten fantastic replay value from it.",1362700800,,670,4.566666666666666

3045901,2,B00104AYGA,It starts with a great argument that Manchester made the band and the band helped shape modern Manchester but then it digresses into a bunch of career talk that isn't new and isn't interesting.  At the end they try to reintroduce the opening argument but it is way too late.  Hook is one of my favorite bass players but he's painfully boorish.  And you know the ending of this documentary will be unhappy for the viewer but you realize that the death of Ian Curtis was only a speed bump for these guys.  They went on to sell 20 million records without Curtis and they may feel blessed that he wasn't their singer any longer than he was.,1357084800,2,636,4.364406779661017

But the Joy Division DVD is loaded with features including several bonus interviews which really adds to the original film. A very striking post-film bit on the special features is Sumners whining about U2. Wow, he really goes off on U2 and how they ""ripped off"" JD. Huh? Just a very brief rant but very telling on Sumners' frame of mind which is bitter to say the least. I guess selling 20 million albums as New Order wasn't satisfactory enough. JD's a great band, but U2 they ain't, sorry. Still, this DVD is excellent. Get it. Interesting footnote and historical fact, the final segment of the actual film closes out with the song ""Atmosphere"" as a music bed, EXACT same musical ending as in Control.",1235001600,,864,4.690789473684211

3045912,5,B00104AYGA,"First off I'd like to say that I was a strong critic of the 2007 Anton Corbijn movie ""Control"" because it put Ian Curtis into an awfully banal template where he became just another distraught singer and Joy Division just another band when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.

As an avid fan of Joy Division, I recommend ""Control"" to absolutely no one despite its 'official' status as the Joy Division flick because it wildly diminishes the incredible depth of Joy Division's music and who I believe Curtis really was. Instead, I recommend this documentary not as a substitute to understanding Joy Division but as an introduction; what I'm sure ""Control"" had longed to be. While an hour and a half is hardly enough time to grasp anything, especially a band like Joy Division, this film does justice to the band and details Joy Division's origin, Curtis' personality, illness and struggle and why to this day the band's sound remains contemporary and influential in a historically specific, thoughtful manner.

Perhaps the best thing about this documentary is its comprehensiveness and how it doesn't condescend to the audience (like ""Control"" seemed to do) about the subtle yet brutal and tragic story of Joy Division. It's worth mentioning that Tony Wilson appears in this documentary (right before he died, sadly), as does Paul Morley, Peter Saville, the remaining members of the band (Barney, Morris and a seemingly very self-important Hooky) and Annik Honor, the woman Curtis had an affair with who has, until this documentary, avoided all contact regarding the band.

It's this latter figure who I believe makes this documentary precious as Annik's appearance and comments concerning Joy Division, particularly Curtis, are arresting and enough to make this a must-have for fans. Her words are, as are to be expected, precise, insightful and dear. Annik's love for Ian is just as apparent as the pain of his absence, and hearing her talk instills a great longing for Curtis that fans who also loved the man and his words will no doubt identify with.

Overall, this is a very good, comprehensive and tragic documentary because it underlines not just how great Joy Division were and how they were cut short but also how much of a tortured, brilliant and romantic soul Curtis was. With the remaining members growing old and those affiliated with the band continuing to pass on, I believe that this may be the first, last and best documentary the world may be afforded about the great band Joy Division.",1230854400,11,2518,4.945626477541371
3045913,5,B00104AYGA,"Much better than the dramatized movie Control, Joy Division is a good documentary of the phenomenon that was Joy Division.  I was excited at seeing that there were so many extras on the DVD, but most of them turned out to be snippets of interviews, only a few of which were interesting (and one or two were brilliant).  Still, anything on JD is appreciated.  Deborah Curtis, Ian's widow, does not appear, and one wonders why she was not involved.  Annik Honore appears quite often as the Yoko to Ian's Lennon.  And boy, have the other members of the group gotten older!  Time has its way with us all, but Ian Curtis remains forever young and bold.",1230681600,4,647,4.5344827586206895

This unties the vision that the film tries to explore about Ian Curtis' way of thinking and final decision, showing JUST the half of Ian's dilema: an interview with the beauty and sofisticated but uncomfortable Annik (the lover), but leaving away the point of view of the person that last saw Ian alive (and who found him death), and the one he didn't want to leave because he loved her: Debbie (the wife and Ian's daughter mother).

  Unlike Control, the feature film centered around just the lead singer Ian Curtis, this doc covers all the bases and with style.

3045920,5,B00104AYGA,"Between ""24 Hour Party People,"" Anton Corbijn's feature ""Control,"" and Grant Gee's  documentary ""Joy Division,"" I think Gee's docu is the best. ""24 Hour"" sets the stage, delineating the context of Madchester in the early 80s and Tony Wilson's patronage as the Medici of the Northwest, discovering Joy Division/New Order. It's the most fun.

Grant Gee's ""Joy Division"" is informative and rich, with a lot more to give than the very limited feature ""Control."" The documentary focuses on outstanding faces, in crisp black and white, filtered through Final Cut Pro - it's a tasty, original and restrained blend of a music video and straight-up talking head interviews. As each new speaker is introduced, Gee brings up his or her face in soft focus behind their name-title. As the name fades from the screen and they begin to talk, the face snaps into focus.

The personalities are priceless - the surviving members of the band are honest and bare-faced, not ""rockstar"" at all, never mind that as the ultra-hip New Order they had the best-selling 12"" single in history with ""Blue Monday."" They're fabulous to watch and listen to. The historic footage of Ian Curtis shows us his sculpted white-marble features, the full mouth of Michelangelo's David, punctuated by icy blue eyes - someone in the film says his eyes were ""translucent."" One in a million, that face.

Annik Honore, Ian Curtis's Belgian girlfriend, is articulate and open, glamorous and ethereally beautiful. If she broke up his marriage, one of the catalysts of Curtis's final breakdown, it's easy to understand her pull on him. Curtis's wife Deborah does not appear on screen, though her writing does.

Producer Martin Harnett, caricatured in ""24 Hour Party People"" by Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"") as a nasty, portly drunk, is slender and wiry in the historic footage, very on. He was a co-developer of the AMS digital delay box, which he used for Joy Division's distinctive drum sound. It's not just the funky off-beats that the drummer employed - it's that instant spatial reverb SOUND that's such a sharp turn away from Punk. That's the real Harnett, not the cartoon version.

Peter Saville, Factory Records' graphic designer, looks more like a glamorous British actor than anyone has the right to, and has the resonant voice as well - his contribution was to put a brand-new graphical Modern look on what became Post Punk - a new direction just as the music took a new turn, evolving with Joy Division through New Order.

Saville's girlfriend at the time was Martha Ladly, the lanky blonde Canadian who was one of the two Marthas in Toronto's Martha and the Muffins. After leaving the Muffins and moving to England, she sang backup for the Associates on their masterpiece ""Sulk"" album. She appears in the Associates videos of the time, too, a foot taller than all the wee Scotsmen. It's her painting that Saville put on New Order's ""1981 - Factus 8 - 1982"" EP. Ladly was in charge of Peter Gabriel's groundbreaking Internet music efforts in the 1990s. Ian Curtis - New Order - Tony Wilson - Peter Saville - Martha Ladly: these people are gods.",1217980800,8,3134,4.857677902621723

There are interviews with all of the band members, Tony Wilson, Peter Saville and...ANNIK.  Finally there she is and she is a sensitive, refined person who offers yet another angle on Joy Division and Ian Curtis.  I wish Martin Hannett and Rob Gretton were still around to give their accounts.  Actually, this documentary gives a fuller picture of all the players, not just of Ian, as it is customary in the JD mythification process.  There are also several extra interviews and snippets that offer a lot more than a chronology of gigs and records.  This documentary proves how much there is to Joy Division and how many more books and topics can be generated through the influence of this remarkable band.

I especially like how the story weaves in the influence of Manchester (we are products of our environment, aren't we?) and the special chemistry between all four members--a chemistry that was not really discussed or examined. This is a must-have for all JD fans. So many nuggets of information about the group, the gigs and the recordings. (Also, highly recommended is the related documentary from a few years ago called Shadowplayers about the whole Manchester scene in the late 70s, early 80s.) The one thing that always gets me though is how Hooky, Bernard and Morris say that they never really listened to Ian's lyrics. I guess that is what is also so shocking about Ian's suicide is that in retrospect his lyrics seemed to be detailing a road map to his final irreversible act.",1214697600,,878,4.782894736842105
3045928,5,B00104AYGA,"As a fan of Joy Division, you know how it's been.  You wait, hope and pray for anything you haven't heard, read or seen before.  A rare, live version of Shadowplay on an import CD that might send tingles up your spine.  Just like the first time.  Or a piece of new information in a hard to find book that might shed more light on the mystery that is Joy Division.  We want to know more, we want to know why, we want to know everything.

Now we can rest.  Joy Division (The Miriam Collection) (2007) is the elixir we've been seeking for a lifetime.  No more second rate documentaries thrown together, offering nothing.  Here are the older men; New Order opening up as never before.  Anton Corbijn recounting why he moved to Manchester.  Annik Honore coming forward after a quarter century with a perspective only she could have.  And Genesis P-Orridge.

Many people forget or aren't aware that Throbbing Gristle, the most influential band industrial music has ever known, were huge fans of Joy Division.  While their musical styles are different, both offer heavy soundtracks of a grim, bleak and hopeless late 1970's England.  Genesis got to know Ian towards the end of his days and offers great insight into the man well beyond the myth.  Yes, Genesis does look more and more like Liza Minelli every day and that can have a disturbing effect on viewers.  Yet after seeing the factory heavy landscape of Manchester and England some 30 years ago, I'm frankly surprised that anyone survived.  So, grab another tube of lipstick, Genesis, and have fun.

Sometimes, penetrating the mythology and legend of a enigmatic band can be a disappointment.  After learning what you longed to learn, the esotericism is gone and little remains.  That is not the case here.  Joy Division was far more than the sum of its parts.  Beyond the suicide, the profoundly dark music and powerful artwork was a band that transcended time and means as much today as ever.  In spite of the God awful Goth label that gets attached to them, they have proven that they were a tough band in a tough time, clawing at the walls and expressing better than most what it felt like to be screwed.

This is the sound of disillusionment.  For every kid or adult who has ever felt something is wrong and can't put their finger on it.  Alienation, anger, intellect and the poetry of hopelessness.  To this day, as shown in this film, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner still don't think Unknown Pleasures is a good album.  Not because it's a sub par record but because it's so weighted with darkness.  And it is.  For the suicidal, Unknown Pleasures and Closer could act at gateways to the grave.  New Order spoke about how they didn't know what the lyrics to Closer were during the recording.  Maybe they didn't want to know, or, as someone said, maybe they thought it was just harmless art.  In retrospect, those very lyrics were bullets in a gun.  Closer is so drenched in sorrow that possibly the only way it could be made was through a certain youthful ignorance.  It is touching to see New Order talk about that time regretfully, being so young and naive.  It's no wonder that it took so long for them to talk about those dark days.

But talk they did and we as fans are better off for it.  This documentary was an absolute pleasure and deepened my love for Joy Division.  Like their music, this film makes you feel.  If by the end you don't experience the cold chill of a dreadful finality, you're not really alive.  While Joy Division may sound like an auditory funeral at times, there is a paradoxical sense of survival.  Against all odds, without reason or desire, we must go on.  We must go on...",1214611200,25,3660,4.573189522342065

3045930,5,B00104AYGA,"From beginning to end, this was an illuminating look at the phenomenon that was Joy Division.  I was motivated to watch this after viewing the film Control, and this is definitely a companion piece to it.  However, I was also very much reminded of New Order Story - the documentary about the band that rose from Joy Division's ashes.  The Joy Division beginnings are mentioned in NOS, but are for the most part glossed over.  That film covered the Who and What of JD before continuing on; this documentary talks about the Why, and in great depth.

The other members of Joy Division were famously quiet on the topic of Ian Curtis for many years; it's wonderful to hear them open up and talk about it.  It was also enlightening to FINALLY hear from Annik Honore'.  She's been kind of a biographical footnote for years, and is mentioned only in passing in Deborah Curtis's biography of Ian.  Finally we can put a face to the name and hear her side of Ian's story.

If you're at all interested in Ian and the band, you'd be foolish NOT to see this.",1213747200,21,1044,4.4526315789473685
3280367,5,B00104AYGA,"Tremendous documentary. Interviews with Annik Honore (finally!), Tony Wilson (and not someone playing Tony Wilson), and all of the surviving band members (Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris, & Peter Hook) plus Buzzcock Pete Shelley and Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon, plus music journalist and Joy Division biographer Paul Morley, plus album designer Peter Saville ... this is really a goldmine for Joy Division fans. Truly, an overwhelming amount of detailed information here. Even if you think you've heard it all, stories become more than just talk when told by someone who was actually there. Plus loads of vintage footage of the band performing in various venues. More than I knew existed.

Interestingly enough the documentary starts off with a quote, that I found to be quite compelling:

To be modern is to find ourselves in an environment that promises us adventure, power, joy, growth, transformation of ourselves and the world--and at the same time that threatens to destroy everything we have, everything we know, everything we are.

--Marshall Berman, All That is Solid Melts Into Air

This will give you some indication that this is not your typical rock documentary that recounts the rise and fall of yet another generic rock band. This is a rock documentary that is completley different from any that you have seen before, and that is fitting given the subject matter. Manchester, we learn, was in many ways the first modern city. And Joy Division, in many ways was creatively inspired (if that is the right word) by the fact that they lived in a purely utilitarian city designed to maximize economic efficiency. (Bernard Sumner mentions, almost in passing, that he never saw a tree until he was nine.) If Control was primarily a story about a marriage, then Grant Gee's ""Joy Division"" is about a place and a time: Manchester in the late seventies. This sounds ambitious, and it is, but Gee succeeds brilliantly in giving us an idea of where those mysterious Joy Division sounds & visions were coming from. This is a documentary that attempts to contextualize a band that dared to be culturally significant, and does so in a culturally significant way.

Manchester is both cerebrally & viscerally unique and this is a documentary that strikes to the core of how Joy Division processed the environment that became so much a part of their music. One might almost say that this is a documentary with two subjects: Joy Division & Manchester. Grant Gee certainly has a point of view here, and many of those interviewed here seem to share the belief that there is a ""psychogeographic"" (at least two of them use that very word) link between the time and the place it was made & the Joy Division sound. This is maybe not a surprising observation to make for it seems obvious that we are all, to a certain extent, products of our environment, but rarely has this oft thought axiom been so well expressed, and few, I suspect, have explored it more thoroughly than Ian Curtis.

This documentary is, in short, everything that Control was not.

It is full of substantial insight.

The most insightful and revealing and moving interview is the Annik Honore interview. She is a very delicate, very sensitive creature, and also one with a very refined sensibility. When she discusses Ian's stage presence and how he transformed into another kind of person onstage it is haunting and one feels that she among all that knew him, knew & understood him best.

The surviving Joy Division, now New Order, band members are surprisingly upbeat. Each of them breaks into laughter very easily when discussing the past. Apparently, the band shied away from playing Joy Division songs until recently.

One particularly memorable moment is when Sumner plays a tape of Ian Curtis answering questions under hypnosis. Sumner asks him to remember a time before he was born and then asks him what he is doing. Ian responds that he is reading books about the law. This is a hauntingly Kafkaesque moment.

Even though producer Martin Hannett (who produced both the Buzzcocks & Joy Division) died many years ago (1991, I believe), he is present here in spirit as each of the band members remembers Hannett's highly unorthodox studio practices; his ""zen"" method of production as one band member puts it. Hook has been quoted as saying that Hannett is responsible for the Joy Division sound, but he seems to retract that here as he insists that although Hannett made many adjustments to the sound, he didn't write the songs. I think an entire documentary could well be dedicated to Hannett. Music journalist Paul Morley, in his book on Joy Division, states that Hannett is the kind of guy that could have heard the sound of the moon passing round the earth.

Manager, and co-founder of Factory records and the Hacienda, Rob Gretton (who died in 1999) is also remembered. On several occasions Grant Gee silently pans the many pages of Gretton's notebooks full of phone numbers, carefully calculated expenditures, events and plans, some of which came to pass, and some of which did not.

Also memorable: An always lively Tony Wilson discussing a night that he was to give a lecture, and after listening to the previous speaker (Richard Florida) go on about creative communities, deciding to talk about death.

I recently saw Control & was disappointed that so much of the film was spent on the marriage (which makes sense as it was based on Deborah Curtis' biography). But this documentary tells the story that Control did not tell. In fact Deborah does not even appear in this documentary. (Deborah is represented only by a few written quotes.) While Control was Ian & Deborah's story (as Deborah saw it), this documentary is about the whole group & Manchester & music.

Extras: DVD includes the entirety of the Joy Division performance of ""Transmission"" on the SO IT GOES show. Plus loads of interview extras that take as much time to watch as the actual film, including discussions of everything from WWII (Morris calls it ""the first big spin"") to synthesizers (Sumners built the first one the band used).

If Control was the populist Joy Division project, this documentary is the thinking mans Joy Division project.

3280393,3,B00104AYGA,"Never gave much thought to the band Joy Division, and my only frame of reference was the film ""24 Hour Party People."" So, I'm grateful for being enlightened via this DVD to the music Joy Division produced with the very talented, albeit distressed Ian Curtis. What really surprised me was how much this story parallels the Pink Floyd saga. You know, anguished lead singer/heart throb - Ian Curtis/Syd Barrett - achieves short and stunning creative leaps, hits the wall hard, and their respective bandmates basically keep on driving, without so much as a backward glance.

Liked the geographical backdrop, that being post industrial Manchester. Living in the Bronx, couldn't believe how much Manchester reminded me of the worst part of our hood here, the South Bronx. Seriously decaying and grim. All members of the band (sans Curtis of course) contribute their memories. Would have liked more concert or TV appearances to have been included. As another reviewer commented, this could have been a lot better. Also, Joy Division was a great band, but testimonials from people in their orbit (don't miss the way out and weird Genesis P-Orridge formerly of Throbbing Gristle by the way) sound like stories of the second coming.

That said, what strongly grated was the total lack of empathy shown for Ian Curtis by his fellow band members. Are these people emotionally challenged or something? For example, bassist Peter Cook recounts how the authorities phoned his home as he was getting ready to eat Sunday afternoon dinner. Scotland Yard informs him that Ian Curtis had killed himself. Does Peter Hook get upset or go into shock? No, he just grins widely and says ""OK, Ian Curtis killed himself,"" then sits down to eat his dinner. No hair off of his back.  Do you think you could eat a meal after hearing such dire news? I know I couldn't. Found it extremely offensive. The drummer, Steven Morris, gets POed when Ian Curtis dies, because basically that was screwing with his career, man, and that was same attitude with Nick Mason of Floyd about Syd Barrett's difficulties. Even more appalling was when the interviewer puts this question to lead guitarist Bernard Sumner: ""So what do you think of the lyrics?""  Without missing a beat, Mr. Sumner shrugs and answers ""Didn't give much thought to the lyrics."" In actuality, Ian Curtis, doomed with the horrible combo of bipolarity and epilepsy, was a tortured soul, and his lyrics were bleak and black. So, while he was on stage pouring his heart out, there beside him all along was guitarist Bernard Sumner, but he wasn't EVEN LISTENING!  Obliviously, the lead guitarist damns his own self on film.  Dumb and dumber:  Peter Hook, Steven Morris, Bernard Sumner, all still totally without a clue.

Another Floyd parallel, after the demise of Ian Curtis, Joy Division morphed into New Order and enjoyed huge success with their keyboard driven/techno ditties. However, without Ian Curtis at the helm their music had a fraction of its former depth, and their live act lost one of the more bizarre stage presences ever. In the end, this documentary is definitely interesting and holds your attention throughout, but it does leaves a distinctly sour aftertaste.",1363046400,7,3200,4.968224299065421
3280394,5,B00104AYGA,"Essential viewing for the Joy Division/ New Order fan.

The film is a thorough discussion on the history of the band from the humble beginnings in a bleak Manchester through the death of Ian Curtis. It's as official as can be with candid contributions from all the remaining members, Tony Wilson, Paul Morley, etc.

As complete as it is it does not demystify the legacy of Joy Division for me.

3280409,5,B00104AYGA,"First off I'd like to say that I was a strong critic of the 2007 Anton Corbijn movie ""Control"" because it put Ian Curtis into an awfully banal template where he became just another distraught singer and Joy Division just another band when in reality nothing could be further from the truth.

As an avid fan of Joy Division, I recommend ""Control"" to absolutely no one despite its 'official' status as the Joy Division flick because it wildly diminishes the incredible depth of Joy Division's music and who I believe Curtis really was. Instead, I recommend this documentary not as a substitute to understanding Joy Division but as an introduction; what I'm sure ""Control"" had longed to be. While an hour and a half is hardly enough time to grasp anything, especially a band like Joy Division, this film does justice to the band and details Joy Division's origin, Curtis' personality, illness and struggle and why to this day the band's sound remains contemporary and influential in a historically specific, thoughtful manner.

Perhaps the best thing about this documentary is its comprehensiveness and how it doesn't condescend to the audience (like ""Control"" seemed to do) about the subtle yet brutal and tragic story of Joy Division. It's worth mentioning that Tony Wilson appears in this documentary (right before he died, sadly), as does Paul Morley, Peter Saville, the remaining members of the band (Barney, Morris and a seemingly very self-important Hooky) and Annik Honor, the woman Curtis had an affair with who has, until this documentary, avoided all contact regarding the band.

It's this latter figure who I believe makes this documentary precious as Annik's appearance and comments concerning Joy Division, particularly Curtis, are arresting and enough to make this a must-have for fans. Her words are, as are to be expected, precise, insightful and dear. Annik's love for Ian is just as apparent as the pain of his absence, and hearing her talk instills a great longing for Curtis that fans who also loved the man and his words will no doubt identify with.

Overall, this is a very good, comprehensive and tragic documentary because it underlines not just how great Joy Division were and how they were cut short but also how much of a tortured, brilliant and romantic soul Curtis was. With the remaining members growing old and those affiliated with the band continuing to pass on, I believe that this may be the first, last and best documentary the world may be afforded about the great band Joy Division.",1230854400,11,2518,4.945626477541371
3280410,5,B00104AYGA,"Much better than the dramatized movie Control, Joy Division is a good documentary of the phenomenon that was Joy Division.  I was excited at seeing that there were so many extras on the DVD, but most of them turned out to be snippets of interviews, only a few of which were interesting (and one or two were brilliant).  Still, anything on JD is appreciated.  Deborah Curtis, Ian's widow, does not appear, and one wonders why she was not involved.  Annik Honore appears quite often as the Yoko to Ian's Lennon.  And boy, have the other members of the group gotten older!  Time has its way with us all, but Ian Curtis remains forever young and bold.",1230681600,4,647,4.5344827586206895
3280411,3,B00104AYGA,"Actually, this is an incomplete film because one fact: There isn't any kind of participation with Deborah Woodruffe (aka Debbie Curtis, Ian's wife), who is a central part on Ian's life and so, Joy Division's trajectory.

This unties the vision that the film tries to explore about Ian Curtis' way of thinking and final decision, showing JUST the half of Ian's dilema: an interview with the beauty and sofisticated but uncomfortable Annik (the lover), but leaving away the point of view of the person that last saw Ian alive (and who found him death), and the one he didn't want to leave because he loved her: Debbie (the wife and Ian's daughter mother).

Producers and Director should wait until they have the complete material.

In the other hand, you can watch ""Control"" simultaneosly (with Samantha Morton in Debbie's role, and the angel come from heaven Ana Mara Lara in Annik's role) and complete the scene.",1222732800,6,912,4.870967741935484

If you're a Radiohead fan you may have seen the doc of them titled Meeting People Is Easy, another masterpiece documentary in my opinion done by the same director as this one , Grant Gee. It is also written by a real insider into the Joy Division scene as well, Jon Savage. If you're familiar at all with Joy Division and/or New Order don't even hesitate about viewing this, it interviews everyone connected to the band imaginable with awesomely introspective bits coupled with great performance footage.

  Unlike Control, the feature film centered around just the lead singer Ian Curtis, this doc covers all the bases and with style. But even if you're not quite or not at all aware of Joy Division, you will be sucked into this story I guarantee it.

3280417,5,B00104AYGA,"Between ""24 Hour Party People,"" Anton Corbijn's feature ""Control,"" and Grant Gee's  documentary ""Joy Division,"" I think Gee's docu is the best. ""24 Hour"" sets the stage, delineating the context of Madchester in the early 80s and Tony Wilson's patronage as the Medici of the Northwest, discovering Joy Division/New Order. It's the most fun.

Grant Gee's ""Joy Division"" is informative and rich, with a lot more to give than the very limited feature ""Control."" The documentary focuses on outstanding faces, in crisp black and white, filtered through Final Cut Pro - it's a tasty, original and restrained blend of a music video and straight-up talking head interviews. As each new speaker is introduced, Gee brings up his or her face in soft focus behind their name-title. As the name fades from the screen and they begin to talk, the face snaps into focus.

The personalities are priceless - the surviving members of the band are honest and bare-faced, not ""rockstar"" at all, never mind that as the ultra-hip New Order they had the best-selling 12"" single in history with ""Blue Monday."" They're fabulous to watch and listen to. The historic footage of Ian Curtis shows us his sculpted white-marble features, the full mouth of Michelangelo's David, punctuated by icy blue eyes - someone in the film says his eyes were ""translucent."" One in a million, that face.

Annik Honore, Ian Curtis's Belgian girlfriend, is articulate and open, glamorous and ethereally beautiful. If she broke up his marriage, one of the catalysts of Curtis's final breakdown, it's easy to understand her pull on him. Curtis's wife Deborah does not appear on screen, though her writing does.

Producer Martin Harnett, caricatured in ""24 Hour Party People"" by Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollum in ""Lord of the Rings"") as a nasty, portly drunk, is slender and wiry in the historic footage, very on. He was a co-developer of the AMS digital delay box, which he used for Joy Division's distinctive drum sound. It's not just the funky off-beats that the drummer employed - it's that instant spatial reverb SOUND that's such a sharp turn away from Punk. That's the real Harnett, not the cartoon version.

Peter Saville, Factory Records' graphic designer, looks more like a glamorous British actor than anyone has the right to, and has the resonant voice as well - his contribution was to put a brand-new graphical Modern look on what became Post Punk - a new direction just as the music took a new turn, evolving with Joy Division through New Order.

Saville's girlfriend at the time was Martha Ladly, the lanky blonde Canadian who was one of the two Marthas in Toronto's Martha and the Muffins. After leaving the Muffins and moving to England, she sang backup for the Associates on their masterpiece ""Sulk"" album. She appears in the Associates videos of the time, too, a foot taller than all the wee Scotsmen. It's her painting that Saville put on New Order's ""1981 - Factus 8 - 1982"" EP. Ladly was in charge of Peter Gabriel's groundbreaking Internet music efforts in the 1990s.

Actually, this documentary gives a fuller picture of all the players, not just of Ian, as it is customary in the JD mythification process.  There are also several extra interviews and snippets that offer a lot more than a chronology of gigs and records.

3280424,5,B00104AYGA,"As a longtime Joy Division fan, I was eagerly anticipating this DVD and it does not disappoint. I especially like how the story weaves in the influence of Manchester (we are products of our environment, aren't we?) and the special chemistry between all four members--a chemistry that was not really discussed or examined. This is a must-have for all JD fans. So many nuggets of information about the group, the gigs and the recordings. (Also, highly recommended is the related documentary from a few years ago called Shadowplayers about the whole Manchester scene in the late 70s, early 80s.) The one thing that always gets me though is how Hooky, Bernard and Morris say that they never really listened to Ian's lyrics. I guess that is what is also so shocking about Ian's suicide is that in retrospect his lyrics seemed to be detailing a road map to his final irreversible act.",1214697600,,878,4.782894736842105
3280425,5,B00104AYGA,"As a fan of Joy Division, you know how it's been.  You wait, hope and pray for anything you haven't heard, read or seen before.  A rare, live version of Shadowplay on an import CD that might send tingles up your spine.  Just like the first time.  Or a piece of new information in a hard to find book that might shed more light on the mystery that is Joy Division.  We want to know more, we want to know why, we want to know everything.

Now we can rest.  Joy Division (The Miriam Collection) (2007) is the elixir we've been seeking for a lifetime.  No more second rate documentaries thrown together, offering nothing.  Here are the older men; New Order opening up as never before.  Anton Corbijn recounting why he moved to Manchester.  Annik Honore coming forward after a quarter century with a perspective only she could have.  And Genesis P-Orridge.

Many people forget or aren't aware that Throbbing Gristle, the most influential band industrial music has ever known, were huge fans of Joy Division.  While their musical styles are different, both offer heavy soundtracks of a grim, bleak and hopeless late 1970's England.  Genesis got to know Ian towards the end of his days and offers great insight into the man well beyond the myth.  Yes, Genesis does look more and more like Liza Minelli every day and that can have a disturbing effect on viewers.  Yet after seeing the factory heavy landscape of Manchester and England some 30 years ago, I'm frankly surprised that anyone survived.  So, grab another tube of lipstick, Genesis, and have fun.

Sometimes, penetrating the mythology and legend of a enigmatic band can be a disappointment.  After learning what you longed to learn, the esotericism is gone and little remains.  That is not the case here.  Joy Division was far more than the sum of its parts.  Beyond the suicide, the profoundly dark music and powerful artwork was a band that transcended time and means as much today as ever.  In spite of the God awful Goth label that gets attached to them, they have proven that they were a tough band in a tough time, clawing at the walls and expressing better than most what it felt like to be screwed.

This is the sound of disillusionment.  For every kid or adult who has ever felt something is wrong and can't put their finger on it.  Alienation, anger, intellect and the poetry of hopelessness.  To this day, as shown in this film, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner still don't think Unknown Pleasures is a good album.  Not because it's a sub par record but because it's so weighted with darkness.  And it is.  For the suicidal, Unknown Pleasures and Closer could act at gateways to the grave.  New Order spoke about how they didn't know what the lyrics to Closer were during the recording.  Maybe they didn't want to know, or, as someone said, maybe they thought it was just harmless art.  In retrospect, those very lyrics were bullets in a gun.  Closer is so drenched in sorrow that possibly the only way it could be made was through a certain youthful ignorance.  It is touching to see New Order talk about that time regretfully, being so young and naive.  It's no wonder that it took so long for them to talk about those dark days.

But talk they did and we as fans are better off for it.  This documentary was an absolute pleasure and deepened my love for Joy Division.  Like their music, this film makes you feel.  If by the end you don't experience the cold chill of a dreadful finality, you're not really alive.  While Joy Division may sound like an auditory funeral at times, there is a paradoxical sense of survival.  Against all odds, without reason or desire, we must go on.  We must go on...",1214611200,25,3660,4.573189522342065

That film covered the Who and What of JD before continuing on; this documentary talks about the Why, and in great depth.

The other members of Joy Division were famously quiet on the topic of Ian Curtis for many years; it's wonderful to hear them open up and talk about it.  It was also enlightening to FINALLY hear from Annik Honore'.  She's been kind of a biographical footnote for years, and is mentioned only in passing in Deborah Curtis's biography of Ian.
