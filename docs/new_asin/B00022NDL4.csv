8020928,5,B00022NDL4,"Along with ""A vow to cherish"", these two are my favorite of all the films made by Billy Graham's team.  Because these two films have the gospel message being the central driving force and changing power in the main characters.  You can see how grace and forgiveness are lived out in real lives.  Other Billy Graham's films are great also.  I would watch any Billy Graham's film over all other secular films.  Secular films may be entertaining and very well made, but they all leave me feeling no peace and craving for more entertainment.  On the otehr hands, all of Billy Grahams film leave me encouraged and inspired to love God and my neighbors in a real way.  Go watch all of Billy Graham's films and see if you agree!",1158537600,2,721,4.5
