7904628,5,B000006QFH,"Carnegie was not a perfect man, and this video shows the man warts and all.  His triumphs, including his rags to riches story, show the American dream was alive and well in the Gilded Age.

The program includes his failures as well.  The Homestead Strike being the most obvious failure is well documented.  His guilt over that incident is brought out.  While the program glosses over his direct involvement regarding the strike, it still shows Carnegie's attitude to his workers.

This video is great in that it dispels the ""robber baron"" myth that surrounds Carnegie.  He used shrewd business sense and an incredible drive to succeed.  We would do well to give this captain of industry his due and learn from his desire to succeed and his desire to help others succeed as well.",1132185600,,778,4.753731343283582
