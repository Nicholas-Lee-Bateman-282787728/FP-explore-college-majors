8631900,1,B003TO5J3M,"This is the other DVD David Huey released with the Diamond. SAVE YOUR MONEY. This guy couldn't direct his way out of traffic let alone a movie. Nothing like watching fights from a grainy cam corder in the stands by a guy who doesn't even think he should actually follow the fighters with the camera. The statement of this is the young Malaipet is just a lie, this is the old Malaipet after he had retired in Thailand and came to america. Raw, yeah its raw as in recorded with a $200 camcorder by a guy who seems to not know how to film something. This guy Huey is cashing in on the name Malaipet any way he can while con jobbing real fans out of their money. This is two DVDs that he has made which are total garbage. Save your money and watch Malaipet on Youtube, the quality is the same or better. Huey should be ashamed of himself for releasing the garbage that he does.",1305072000,7,873,4.2023809523809526
