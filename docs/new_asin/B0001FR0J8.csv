8011919,4,B0001FR0J8,"Basically you have a band that makes weird but strangely addictive music, that then also makes weird but strangely addictive movies.  The particular compilation, in my opinion, has two amazing shorts and then some fairly bad ones.

The first amazing one is Man on The Moon, about a man who goes to live alone on the moon to get away from the pain of his breakup.  In my opinion it is one of the best breakup movies ever.  Not because it provides any kind of catharsis or even a plot, Billy Nayer isn't about easy answers or even making 100% sense, but because I think every guy at one point has felt like nowhere on Earth is far enough away from the pain of watching his ex with another guy.

And then the other great short is a musical animation that he apparently drew on his bathroom wall, which has a killer song that I quote all the time (and no one gets).

Look, if you like The American Astronaut, you already know you want to watch this, so just get it.  If you haven't seen the American Astronaut, your life as a film aficionado or even a true sci-fi fan is entirely incomplete.  So, you know, you should probably address that...",1391212800,4,1138,4.334905660377358
8011920,4,B0001FR0J8,"Rock extroardinaires, the Billy Nayer Show, were an intensely intriguing musical and film-making force during the 90's and early millenium. This is their most celebrated film, featuring several of their earlier shorts. While they certainly are not anything like your average rock band, one cannot knock the hustle and creativity of The Billy Nayer Show.",1337558400,,353,5.4363636363636365
