8412763,5,B0041G68HI,Sarah is a stand up genius - truly funny and perfect timing - it may be more suited to us Brits but if you are a fan of british comedy don't miss this funny lady.,1376006400,,162,3.657142857142857
8412764,4,B0041G68HI,"This has to be one of the funniest women I have seen. I saw her on the one show and was looking for ages for a DVD on her. I think it is so worth buying this, it will have you in stitches. I didn't want this to end. Happy to recommend and give 4 stars.",1355443200,,252,3.517857142857143
8412765,5,B0041G68HI,"This girl is awesome! She uses humor and life in such an adult way, and to hear her swear (and use the 'f' word) in a Geordie accent is priceless.  She chatters away on subjects as wide as motherhood, shopping, sex, boyfriends and the human anatomy in a wonderfully happy, chirpy manner, and involves the audience so that they are part of the show with her.

Do not miss this girl.  She is a treasure.  If though, you're  not into adult humor, steer clear.  I just wish I could watch it over here in the States but will have to wait until they bring out a NTSC version.  But when they eventually do, it will have been worth the wait.",1332028800,2,633,4.225
