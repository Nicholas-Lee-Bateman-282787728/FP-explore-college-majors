It became one of my favorite stories but I never saw anything about it after I left elementary school.  a few people have a problem with this video because they cannot ""understand""  the accent that danny glover uses.  I saw the video when I was in at least 4th grade and I understood every word.  I think If you are not used to hearing ""ethnic"" African/Carribbean-English accents, this is not the movie for for you.  It attempts to make the atory authentic and is successful.  I recommend this video to anyone who can get over themselves long enough to get past the accent and relax and enjoy a wonderful story!!!",1106179200,,667,4.462809917355372

I was excited to find this video, as we were studying African tales and I thought this would work well with the other ""How The. . . "" stories we had been studying.  The music is great, the pictures are lovely, but Danny Glover's voice is almost impossible to understand.  It's not the talented Glover's fault, the music or bass somehow overshadows his voice on the tape.  At first, I thought it was my old VCR's fault, but no, I tried it on a new one with the same results.  My students were really annoyed by the fact that they could not understand the narrator's words, so this video goes back on the shelf.",1044057600,,698,4.297709923664122
