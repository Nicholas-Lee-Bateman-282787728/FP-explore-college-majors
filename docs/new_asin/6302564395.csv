MHC has written some really thrilling books and they have not yet been filmed like ""All through the Night"", ""On the Street where you live"", ""Daddy's little Girl"", ""The second Time around"", """"Night Time is my Time"", ""No Place like Home"", ""Two little Girls in Blue"", ""I heard that Song before"", ""Where are you now?"" and ""Just take my Heart"".
Except of her boring Willy & Alvirah stories I love all her books and look forward to each new one.

My favorite MHC movies are ""Stillwatch"" (Angie Dickinson), ""A Cry in the Night"" (Perry King and famous French actress Annie Girardot), ""Remember me"" (Kelly McGillis), ""Moonlight becomes you"" (Donna Mills), ""We'll meet again"", ""A Crime of Passion"", ""Before I say Goodbye"", ""Haven't we met before?"" (Nicolette Sherdian) and especially ""I'll be seeing you"" (Alison Eastwood) and ""Try to remember"" with Gabrielle Anwar and Diego Wallraff which I all can recommend as very good TV movies.",1285545600,,1106,4.725388601036269
7828257,1,6302564395,"And when I say a waste of time I mean a COMPLETE waste of time. No plot, terrible story, bad acting and a horrible horrible ending, this movie was laughably bad, truly horrifying it was so stupid. Please whatever you do,  whatever it takes, listen to me, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME on this awful piece  of crap. You will be extremely disappointed. This is based on a Mary  Higgin's Clark story, but it is nothing like the one she has written. You  will be bored and confused. STAY AWAY. I really regret wasting 13 bucks on  this shit, so imagine if you waste 90...",957398400,7,560,4.295238095238095
7828258,1,6302564395,"absolutely bad...after seeing the terrific adaption of 'Cry in the Night' based on the novel by the same author, I expected this film to not only equal it, but surpass it due to the better story line...but all the film  succeded in doing was boring me to death and leaving my mouth wide open in  shock and disbelief at how a movie could be so bad!",954633600,7,347,4.242424242424242
7828259,2,6302564395,"'Double Vision' is double terrible...the film comes off to a good start and the plot is an intriguing one I must admit...but just when you think that the story is going somewhere, it goes nowhere...The film is confusing  and the ending did not make any sense at all....trust me you will not be  surprised....the only thing I had to recommend this film was the intriguing  plot, but even that went nowhere and I was so disappointed, especially  since this is a Mary Higgins Clark story....totally pointless adaption  which could have worked at the hands of a capable writer...a remake would  be appreciated....a worthy Clark adaption would be ""A Cry in the  Night"", which alos contains a badly executed ending, but a great story  and actual suspense....that one gets 4 stars so check it out instead...",954115200,3,800,4.874074074074074
