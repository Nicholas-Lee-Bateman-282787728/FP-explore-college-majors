8305287,5,B0009N7RC2,"Unlike the other reviewer, I really like this DVD.  I'm in full blown menopause and I think this is a great DVD.  Some DVD's that I've purchased don't emphasize the breathing enough.  This one explains why you're doing poses, what they are good for, and how to correctly do them.  Susan is a great teacher and this DVD works every muscle in your body.",1235520000,5,351,4.4375
8305288,1,B0009N7RC2,"This is just a regular yoga practice, not at all what it purports to be by the title. There is a surprising lack of useful information about women's health and hormones, and how various poses are of benefit to women. This yoga routine probably requires more energy than many perimenopausal or menopausal women have, if they haven't been treating their symptoms which can include flat out exhaustion. Far more useful is Kathy Smith's ""Moving Through Menopause"" DVD/video, which is packed with a huge amount of helpful information and interviews with various experts on the many ways of healing, as well as a wonderful restorative yoga routine and other added features. Unfortunately I bought this prior to hearing about ""Moving Through Menopause"". Don't waste your money on this one.",1143849600,5,782,5.1171875
