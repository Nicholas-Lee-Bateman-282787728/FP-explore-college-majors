4155279,4,B003M9ZA88,I bought these because my 2 and a half year old LOVES My Friends Tigger and Pooh.  I do have several of the TV shoes taped but I don't think it's any of these.  I bought it because Disney quit airing the show over the summer and we wanted some new episodes.  One note about the title of these movies:  they are NOT relevant to the episodes contained thereon.  It's just what they named the DVD.  The stories contained on this DVD are:  Pooh's Double Trouble/Eeyore Sleeps on It; Eeyore's Sad Day/Tigger's Bedtime for Bouncer; and Buster's Bath/Once in a Pooh Moon.  Bonus episode is Handy Manny's Tool for Sale.,1284163200,16,611,4.490909090909091

4155281,1,B003M9ZA88,"Based on the description (and the numerous commercials they ran on Disney Channel leading up to the release of this DVD) we thought it was a new feature, like some others Disney has put out (like the Super Duper Super Sluths).  This is NOT the case!  It's just a compilation of three very old tv episodes.  A complete rip-off (and misleading advertising) unless you happen to want those three episodes on DVD.",1283212800,6,409,4.652777777777778
