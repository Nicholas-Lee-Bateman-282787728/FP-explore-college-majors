6947637,4,B00S1VJRJU,"Thriller is a British television series, originally broadcast in the UK from 1973 to 1976. Originally screened late night in the US under the ABC Wide World of Entertainment in 1978 there were 6 seasons

-------This is NOT the Boris Karloff Series.-------

UPDATE April 7 -I'm THRILLED!!!, just got my copy in the mail,
there are no extras as commentaries, but there are 13 discs (not 12 as shown in the Amazon specs) in 2 separate packages, Series 1 -3 (23 mystery movies 0n 7 discs) and series 4-6 (20 mystery movies on 6 discs),there are 3 or 4 episodes per disc 61 - 67 minutes each.
A quick glance at the first disc shows a very pleasant interactive menu, showing a scene of each epsode. I checked the first show, and there was Barbara Feldon, looking absolutely gorgeous, like she did on Get Smart, and it is such a treat to hear both British and American accents together, the audio quality is superior and the video quality is also very good. One excellent feature, on the back of each case, there is a full episode guide with a recap of each show, and the episode titles used on the back cover are the British titles.

 From Amazon. Com Season 1 descriprion:
Positively Hitchcockian, with a liberal dose of the supernatural, nothing is what it seems in each feature length episode of THRILLER. Witches, serial killers, ghosts, con-artists, Satanists and terrorists are just some of the villains involved in the outlandish plots, the unexpected twists and the even more surprising endings. But it's what you can't see--the sinister atmosphere, the almost unbearable tension--that makes this one of television's most terrifyingly enjoyable shows ever.

The stories are often set in the English home counties, but most episodes, especially from the second season onwards, feature at least one American character, usually portrayed by an American guest star, in order to appeal to the American market. In 1978 some episodes were retitled for US syndication and all had additional opening sequences shot, with new titles and credits Some of the more notable guest stars were Barbara Feldon(Get Smart), Linda Thorson(The Avengers), Donna Mills, Judy Carne{Laugh-In}, Polly Bergen, Hayley Mills(Disney Superstar), Stephen Rea, Helen Mirren, George Maharis(Route 66), Linda Day George, Richard Todd, Pamela Franklin, Diana Dors, Judy Geeson(To Sir With Love), Carrol Baker, Carol Lynley, Edd Byrnes(77 Sunset Strip), Tom Conti, Bradford Dillman and Bob Hoskins.

A particular trademark of the series' storytelling was to hook the viewer with a simple yet totally baffling situation Some of the more notable episodes:

""Come Out Come Out, Wherever You Are"" takes place at a creaky country house hotel where a female guest begins asking where her travelling companion has disappeared to. The owner claims there was no such guest with her upon her arrival last night

 ""Screamer"" concerns a rape victim who murders her attacker only for the man to then to be seen everywhere stalking her.

""The Double Kill"", concerns a man hires a hitman to kill his wife, but makes a fatal error in his otherwise meticulous planning.

""Someone at the Top of the Stairs"", one of a handful of forays into the supernatural, in which two female students move into a boarding house and begin to notice that none of the other residents ever go out or receive any mail,

 ""I'm The Girl He Wants to Kill"", in which a witness to a murder finds herself trapped in a deserted office block overnight with the killer and is forced to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with him to survive, there is barely any dialogue throughout its second half.

""A Coffin for the Bride"" (US: ""Kiss Kiss, Kill Kill"") features a performance from a young Helen Mirren

6947651,4,B00S1VJRJU,"This is not the 1960's American anthology series with Boris Karloff. This is the British anthology program that ran from 1973 to 1976. Brian Clemens (The Avengers, Danger Man) created the series, wrote the stories for all of the episodes and scripted majority of the them. I am a fan of Clemens work, and that was the main reason for purchasing this set. I never saw the show when it aired late night in the United States.
This set is a bargain, especially considering that in 2006 A&E produced a DVD set of Season One at about double the price. If you are a fan of 1970's television and movies, you will enjoy these shows. The very first episode out of the box starred Barbara Felton (Get Smart) and Linda Thorson (The Avengers). Another starred Donna Mills and Judy Carne (Laugh In).
My only criticism is that the episodes look very ""soft"" and lack detail and clarity due to the compression used to fit so many episodes on each disc. The discs come with a waiver that reads, ""Due to the age of these original programs and the high quality resolution that DVD provides,you may or may not notice technical anomalies on this presentation that we are unable to correct.""",1523664000,9,1168,4.566666666666666

6947654,4,B00S1VJRJU,"Very curious British TV show from the early 1970's. I don't know if I'd call them thrillers, though. Some of them are mysteries, others are morality plays, and some are weird supernatural dramas, and some are reminiscent of O'Henry's short stories.  They're all slow moving by today's frenetic standards, but every one is meticulously plotted and very well acted.  Also, each episode runs about 65 minutes and most feature an American actor popular at the time. Gary Collins is in a few, and watching him chew the scenery, it's hard understand why he was a never ""major"" star.  Thoroughly enjoyable,  offbeat show that you'll enjoy if you give it a chance.",1521244800,7,656,4.882882882882883

6947668,5,B00S1VJRJU,I have great memories as a teenager staying up late at night to watch these British mysteries on the ABC Network here in the USA back in the mid 70's.

Maybe the other episodes get better, but this one was so bad, I just couldn't watch any more of this series.

The series did great reviews on Amazon and IMDB, and when I saw it as a Lightning Deal, I fell for it.  Big mistake.  I should have somehow found a way to preview at least one episode before purchasing.",1509235200,,468,4.32183908045977

6947673,5,B00S1VJRJU,"The 5 star rating is for nostalgia.  I watched these in England when I was very young and thought they were the greatest shows ever.  They are campy, the acting in most cases is pretty bad, but for the time and being so young, in my opinion, they were great.  A lot of well known actors starting out in the early 70's are in the episodes.  Children of today, who are born in the technology age, would probably think they were trash.  For us old ones, most of us still like the yesteryear programs.",1493251200,3,497,4.24468085106383

I will say though even though it goes at a slow pace, some of the stories did keep my attention, but not enough to keep. Sorry, but for some who enjoy Agatha Christie, or Sherlock Holms, or Night gallery, you will like this! It just didn't work for me.",1490400000,,530,4.408163265306122

6947686,1,B00S1VJRJU,"I'm amazed at how many people love this show.  I bought it because Brian Clemens made it, but this is certainly not THE AVENGERS.  Inane dialogue and poor direction make for an incredibly boring show.  Endless shots of people walking from place to place or looking emotively into the distance make me think they were trying to make a 50 minute show out of a 25 minute script.  The fast forward button comes in handy.  I did enjoy seeing a lot of old familiar 70's stars.  It must have been Clemens' reputation that enticed them to do the show.",1486684800,4,543,4.434343434343434

6947692,5,B00S1VJRJU,"A surprisingly entertaining collection of murder and mayhem produced (and sometimes written) by Brian Clemens. If you liked The Avengers (the TV show, not Marvel), Danger Man (aka Secret Agent in the US, with Patrick McGoohan) or if you like the kind of melodrama in 70s Hammer films, you will probably like this collection. British guest stars like Freddie Jones, Hayley Mills, Jenny Agutter, Jeremy Brett, Judy Geeson, Charles Gray and Denholm Elliot are paired off with Americans like Donna Mills, Joanna Pettet, Bradford Dillman, Christopher George, George Maharis and Barbara Feldon. It's a blast from the past! One note: the boxes incorrectly state a screen aspect ratio of 16:9 (wide screen) which is ridiculously wrong for any TV shows this old. All episodes are Standard Format (1:33:1).",1477180800,5,796,5.2265625
6947693,1,B00S1VJRJU,"I waited a long time for the entire series to come out. I'm terribly disappointed.  The picture quality itself is very good, but the picture constantly freezes. They explain on a piece of paper as being a problem with dual layering. Why make it that way if they know It's going to happen? If It's cheaper it defeats the purpose. It's unwatchable.

Prior to this there were only selected episodes that were released in the US market about ten years ago and were not as good.

Some discs have as much as 12 20+ minute episodes on them, that's Mill Creek level compression there, most have 3 episodes (9 x 20+ min), but as I said it's video not film so a big difference would not be had by more discs.  I was bored when I first started watching the shows cause it seemed like there was a lot of TV filler but now love them cause I remember seeing them when I was a kid and there is that early 70s British atmosphere.  Some video ghosting and aliasing/bad horizontal resolution for interior shots and double the ghosting for outdoor sequences which look like 16mm.  The region 2 set would look better but this one is much cheaper.  No extras.  Also the cases VEI went with include short disc hubs for the last 2 discs in the second case so they both came loose and got scratched.

6947741,4,B00S1VJRJU,"Wow, this collection brings back great memories! I remember watching a lot of these mini-movies on late-night TV back in the '80s. This British omnibus show ran for 6 seasons (1973-78), with a grand total of 43 suspense stories. Each 65-minute story has British and American stars of the day in (mostly) good tales of murder, madness, and the macabre. Not all 43 are gems, but a surprising number of them hold up very well, and a few of them are as good as anything I ever saw on The Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Everyone will have their fave episodes--mine are ""Someone at the Top of the Stairs,"" ""A Coffin For the Bride"" (with a very young Helen Mirren!), and ""I'm the Girl He Wants To Kill."" Those titles alone tell you what to expect. The ITV Studios boxed set of discs is excellent, with clear picture and sound (for the period). No extras, but we can't have everything. If you're a fan of this show, or if you just love well-made TV thrillers, this package is for you. Recommended.",1443398400,15,1002,4.510989010989011

If you're looking for modern day blood, gore and violence, this isn't your cup of tea. However, what you will find are well written and well acted mystery and suspense thrillers. The best one that I've viewed thus far is titled ""Only A Scream Away"" starring Hayley Mills. I highly recommend this series.",1437955200,22,681,4.412698412698413

The set contains 43 stories that range from murder mysteries to tales of the supernatural. These stories are written by mastermind Brian Clemens, whose involvement in the 60's hit show The Avengers allowed him to pen these Hitchcockian mysteries. The show ran for four seasons and was a hit in the UK.

This DVD set is housed in a somewhat flimsy cardboard sleeve, divided up into two plastic cases. The first set contains 23 episodes, or ""movies"" as they're referred to. Set 2 contains the remaining 20 episodes. Each episode runs around 60 mins and is divided up Into two parts. Picture quality-wise, it's typical of most British TV productions of the 70s, with the majority being filmed on tape. The image quality ranges from soft interiors to dim exterior shots, but is probably the best it can get considering the source.

Bottom line: if you're a fan of vintage UK television, this DVD set is definitely worth your time and money. Highly recommended!",1429920000,42,1050,4.8277777777777775

Quality of DVD is better than I thought, very watchable, and certainly worth the small price.  Great guest stars so far, Judy Carne, Polly Bergen, Donna Mills.  Had to make myself quit watching and go to bed.",1530403200,,349,4.134328358208955

8696891,4,B00S1VJRJU,"The quality of the dvd was good, better than I expected.  If you're expecting plots and acting like Criminal Minds and current movies youll be disappointed.  But after a couple of movies I decided not to be so critical.  Considering these were probably made over 50 years ago they were good.  Its hard to say if most people would enjoy watching these but I find them entertaining.",1527638400,,380,4.626865671641791

I haven't gotten through all episodes yet, but so far, I am more than pleased.  They remind me of the old ""Hammer"" films.  Good buy here with hours of entertainment!",1527206400,,327,4.278688524590164
