8367531,2,B002ECJZEE,"This video does have a pretty thorough telling of Miley's story, but the video quality was astoundingly, oh, there's so many ways to say it, but I'll just go with BAD.  It looked like it was filmed with a cheap camera recording a broadcast on an old T.V.  The audio, except for the narrator, sounded like it had been given a heavy dose of auto-tune.  I also took exception to some of the editorial statments such as ""Dolly Parton's blond bimbo image"".  Voluptious, sexy, yes.  Blond bimbo, no.  If you just have to have everything Miley, get this, but don't bother watching it.  Oh, I watched the HM movie immediately after this and the audio and video were beautiful, so it's not my equipment, unfortuantely.  Cheap video, still not worth the price IMHO.",1256601600,7,755,4.62406015037594
8367532,4,B002ECJZEE,"The rise to stardom and pop princess has been a fast one for a young Tennessee girl who goes by the name of Miley Cyrus. For Miley, it appears as though stardom was born and bred within the teen sensation since within her mother's womb. With the ""one hit wonder"" Billy Ray Cyrus as her father and the fact that one of country music's most famous voices and faces, Dolly Parton, is her godmother, is it any wonder that the girl knows a bit about music?  As though having an incredibly promising and talented voice isn't enough, Miley Cyrus also displays an exceptional talent for writing and acting, which is delightfully apparent in her recordings, her sitcom Hannah Montana, and her full-length movie, Hannah Montana: The Movie.

Through all of of this and the rapid rise of fame, it amazingly appears as though Miley is a fairly well-rounded individual who has, thus far, managed to escape that out-of-control phase that several young teen idols have gone through these past few years.  As a parent, this is a rather reassuring thing, knowing how easily young girls are affected by what they see and hear and how much they want to imitate those they idolize.

In this unauthorized story, The World According to Miley Cyrus, Miley is compared to a young Judy Garland. Though incredibly high praise, this just doesn't seem to ring true to me and seems a bit of an odd comparison. However, there is also mention of the similarities between Miley, on her sitcom Hannah Montana, and Lucille Ball. This seems, to me, an excellent comparison. I had never thought of these two as similar until it was mentioned in this video. They do share a delightful comedic talent that reaches out to grab the viewers and display some similar characteristics in their physical comedy.

This unauthorized DVD takes the fans and viewers into the world of Miley Cyrus. It tells of her ups (her hit TV series Hannah Montana) and her downs (her controversial picture in Vanity Fair), her romances, and the average, everyday fun she loves to partake in. This is a girl who openly admits to having the best of both worlds and realizing she has been blessed.

Also, throughout the video are clips of interviews with fellow Hannah Montana cast members, family, and friends. Through this film, the viewer is given a feeling for who Miley really is. She is incredibly talented in her ability to write, perform, and act and seems as though she truly can accomplish whatever she puts her heart, soul, mind, and hard work into.

I also believe that Miley is a great role model for young girls today. She seems to have virtues and truly cares about her fans and being a good influence. Yes, she's growing up and may make choices that all parents may not agree with, but she is only human, does make mistakes, and will learn from them just as we all do.

As the mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has enjoyed Miley's alter ego Hannah Montana for a couple of years now, we both enjoyed this DVD. It was fun, engaging, and showed that there is a real person behind all of those flashbulbs and glaring lights.

In addition to Miley's story, the DVD includes bonus snippets of peeks into the lives of singer-songwriter Chris Brown, actress Dakota Fanning, and the beloved Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens of High School Musical fame.",1253750400,9,3296,4.688581314878893
8367533,1,B002ECJZEE,"The state of Montana will never be the same.
  Just when you thought it was safe to tune in The Disney Channel comes The World According to Miley Cyrus: An Unauthorized Story. Yes, the producers had the stick the word ""unauthorized"" in the title. Think lawsuits. Think of the profits poor little rich Miley would be losing.
  Actually, you think of her. We'd rather think of Shirley Bassey.
  Cyrus certainly ain't no dame, even if  the star of Hannah Montana has taken the world by storm at the tender age of 16.
  She's one of the most iconic young people in the world. And with such good manners.
  Now that's scary. Scarier than Zsa Zsa nude or the secrets that lurk in Barry Manilow's closets.
  The documentary from Infinity Entertainment Group takes a look at the gal behind the glitz, the babe behind the bling, the product behind the papa. There are even interviews with singer Chris Brown, actress Dakota Fanning and High School Musical co-stars Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron.
  Surrounded by her family (dad and Hannah Montana co-star Billy Ray Cyrus manages her) and raised in Nashville with ""strong moral values,"" (those are Infinity's words not mine!) Miley-""pretty, focused and mature beyond her years"" (ditto)-not only reigns ""teen queen,"" but is poised for a long career.
  Ah, but can Miley survive the pressures of the media that surrounds fame and the nearly unavoidable pitfalls and traps of Hollywood?
  Or will she become another Zsa Zsa, slapping cops, marrying fake royalty and stuffing her face until she could fill the state of Montana.
  She was born Destiny Hope Cyrus, so let's hope destiny isn't too cruel.",1251849600,5,1637,4.837545126353791
