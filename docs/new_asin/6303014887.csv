532578,5,6303014887,"I have always felt a little let down after the Holidays are over and the long winter hangs around for a few months... but when it's spring Time there is no better way to put a smile on your face than watching Easter  Beagle Charlie Brown. Every Good Friday before Easter my family watches  this delightful show and colors eggs. Not to mention... it will six months  until you can watch the Great Pumpkin, so watch Marci scramble the Easter  Eggs, Snoopy Dance with bunnies, and Woodstock decorate his fancy new Bird  house.",949881600,7,523,4.580645161290323
532579,4,6303014887,"Don't believe the ""bad press!""  I think this mini-movie is hysterical.  Woodstock's ""groovy pad"" is the ultimate. And you can't help but love the fact that you end up wanting to smack Marcy for  being so dense.  My friends and I (average age - 25) love ""It's the  Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown.""  I definitely recommend it for any  Peanuts fan.",942364800,23,343,4.616666666666666
532580,1,6303014887,"Take Chevy Chase and his hijinx comedy multiplied by a factor of about a thousand, and you've got this spring junker that completely eschews anything like artistic intuition or style. The first 10 minutes is clogged  with wheezing routines that appear to have no punch, and no punch lines.  Hold your breath, watch and wait for the Easter spirit to rise up from the  Easter egg patch but don't be surprised when you find you've turned  ""blue"".  ""It's the Easter Beagle Charlie Brown"" is a  trail of animation gags. The only thing missing was a magic act- I wish  they could make this movie disappear.
Walt Disney turned over when he saw  this holiday chestnut.",939168000,,660,4.678260869565217

Easter beagle has always been my favorite cartoon, I love watching Peppermint Patty ruin eggs and then ruin more eggs. I loved Marcie's responses every time she noted the latest way PP cooks the eggs. This show never gets old and never goes out of fashion.

I purchased this movie so I am able to watch it whenever the mood to giggle strikes me.",1425427200,2,467,4.4186046511627906
533142,5,6303014887,"You can't help but enjoy the Peanuts specials, no matter how old you are, especially the ones for holidays, as this disc's 15-and-a-half minute documentary explains. This was the first of many Peanuts DVDs from the WB to have 2 specials; one remastered feature program and a bonus unremastered special. The Easter Beagle succeeds here, as the Great Pumpkin failed to show up on Halloween, who's one of Snoopy's many popular personas. I know I've seen Christmassy fabric in Walmart throughout the year, and year-round Christmas stores, but what the Peanuts gang saw in the department store was unbelievable; it's not the gift-getting season, as Schroeder tried to tell Lucy, Easter's a time a renewal and the start of springtime. This special was a rare time where Beethoven's music was playing without Schroeder playing it, in the case of this Easter classic, Beethoven's 7th Symphony! The bonus special is the lesser-known classic, It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown (and no, it's NOT a day where ships sail into the arbor!), which is all explained here, as National Arbor Day is on the last Friday in April. Another toon Nick was playing in the 1990's, The Angry Beavers, paid tribute to Arbor Day too, as the beaver-equivalent of Christmas! For Digimon and Power Rangers fans out there reading this review, I checked Google and the Power Rangers NEVER had an Arbor Day special in real life, in any saga, as was joked about in an episode of Digimon's 2nd season, on Christmas of all times! Anyway, the Peanuts gang rings in Arbor Day by sprucing up Charlie Brown Field, with trees, plants, and veggies, with Linus and Sally's studies of the holiday. It's also similar to Earth Day, which came to be in the 1970's, just like Women's Lib, as Arbor Day was invented in 1872 in Nebraska. The other short bonuses are commercials for other WB DVD's at the time this was originally released, 2008. Two things I should point out about the Arbor Day special, are that even though it was Rerun's animated debut, it was Vince Guaraldi's last Peanuts special, as he passed away just a few hours after finishing the music for this classic. Whether it's for Easter or Arbor Day, add the Easter Beagle to your Peanuts DVD library today, as the WB never thought to release this OR the original Valentine special on Blu-ray, as of 2015. It's a wonder ABC hasn't aired this classic at least once a year like many other Peanuts holiday specials; good grief!",1425340800,,2435,4.7725118483412325

I watched it with my family on Easter Sunday.  My four year old laughed so much that it justified the purchase.

533494,5,6303014887,"I am a big Peanuts fan and always have been.  I love all of the shows and especially the holiday ones.  In this story, the Peanuts gang is preparing for Easter.  Just like in the Great Pumpkin, Linus is again trying to convince his friends that they don't need to worry about preparing for the holiday...this time the Easter Beagle will be bringing all the boys and girls candy and Easter eggs.

Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie all about dying Easter eggs.  Each time they buy another dozen eggs, Marcie manages to misunderstand Patty's directions and ends up frying, waffling, and baking them and even cracking them open into a pot of boiling water, thereby making egg soup.  They are all out of eggs and money, so they now have no Easter eggs.

Charlie Brown takes his little sister Sally to the department store to buy some new Easter shoes.  There are really cute scenes as Sally, Snoopy, and Woodstock have fun trying out music boxes and hats.  What is pretty humorous is that even back in 1974 when this was made, they were poking fun at how early the stores begin selling Christmas decoration and gifts.  The store is all decked out for Christmas at Eastertime, and a giant banner says ""Only 246 Days Till Xmas...Buy Now/Buy Early.""

Woodstock decides he needs a birdhouse, and he and Snoopy go shopping.  Then Woodstock remodels the simple birdhouse that Snoopy buys him and makes it into what looks like a 1970s bachelor pad complete with a sunken living room and spiral staircase.  Too funny!  I love seeing a few scenes in shows like this that basically date it to the time period it was produced.

When Lucy dyes her own Easter eggs and hides them where only she will know where they are, Snoopy finds them and then saves Easter by donning a pair of bunny ears and skipping about distributing one to every child.  Needless to say, Lucy is mad...but everyone else is thankful for the Easter Beagle.",1364515200,,1920,4.602941176470588

The story starts off with Peppermint Patty and Marcie heading down to the market to buy a dozen eggs to show Marcie how easter works, Unfortunatley Marcie oftens toasts the eggs or cracks them open and then boils them in a pot, Theres only one thing Peppermint Patty has too say ""AAUGHH""!!!. After that the peanuts gang is found going to the store to get Sally some new shoes and more eggs for Marcie and Peppermint Patty, Snoopy and Sally find a booth of cute and funky hats and have to insist to put them on. Wal all this is happening Linus is abbsessing about the Easter Beagle and how nobody needs to go shopping, And of course Lucy is there to tell Linus he's crazy, In some parts of the episode  Sally actually believes Linus and thinks the ""Easter Beagle"" is real but then often tells him she remembers waiting in the pumpkin patch for the ""Great Pumpkin"" on Halloween night. On Easter morning everbody is complaining about how nothing went the way they hoped it would go until the ""Easter Beagle"" comes and brightens everbodys day handing them special made easters eggs (Actually made by Lucy, Snoopy stole them from her, eventually in the episode Lucy complains that he gave the same egg to her that she made) At the end of the episode Lucy wants to have a fight with Snoopy but instead he gives her a kiss. Unsuccesully Charlie Brown never got an easter egg. Great awesome DVD!!!

Because of this my wife and I can enjoy watching the Peanuts gangs specials every year just like I always have since I was a kid.

I was looking forward to ""It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown,"" and didn't check the subtitle options because, well, they are always there.  But this one has all of the other Asian languages; Chinese, Korean, Thai, etc ... for some reason they have dropped Japanese from the included list.

Bummer.

533616,4,6303014887,"Once again, Charles Schulz writes an adorable story and the animated cartoon brings the Peanuts characters to life.  This disc has two specials on it, the aforementioned `It's the Easter Beagle' and also, `It's Arbour Day, Charlie Brown!'  Both are cute, though very silly at times.

In the Easter Beagle, Snoopy is caught up with the holiday, as well as replacing Woodstock's destroyed home.  The kids, in various forms, are trying to celebrate the holiday.  In a mystifying move, Marcie, who always seemed super smart, can't figure out how to boil eggs, and makes a variety of accidental dishes instead of boiling them so Peppermint Patty can colour them.  I think the part I liked the most was Snoopy dancing with bunnies, because as we all know, real dogs generally chase bunnies.

In `It's Arbour Day, Charlie Brown!' the story starts off with the kids finding out about this holiday and then deciding they should commemorate it.  In a hilarious move, the kids decide to plant trees all over their baseball field.  Right as Charlie Brown is about to have his first win with his baseball team, it begins to pour rain and the game has to be called off, robbing him of his victory.

I think the thing that threw me the most was the special that came after the cartoons.  I can't remember the name, but one of the `guests' talks about Snoopy being the `joker' or `puck' like character in Peanuts, the trickster.  He talked about all the different people that Snoopy `becomes' in the show.  He erroneously states that Snoopy is the Red Baron.  I was really shocked that this got in.  Any self-respecting Peanuts fan knows that Snoopy is the Flying Ace and he is always trying to shot down the Red Baron.  The fact that this got through edits and no one seemed to notice gives me the impression that a lot of care was not taken in putting this together or as much as there should have been.

But that one detraction aside, the special was cute, interesting, and the two cartoons were what you'd expect from a Peanuts special.  This episode comes on one of the 1970's sets, but I don't know if the Arbour day one shows up as well.  I'm happy I got it, though; I did get it as a gift.",1300233600,,2181,4.517857142857143
533617,3,6303014887,"The Easter Beagle has some enjoyable moments and my young daughter laughed through much of it. Unfortunately the bar was set quite high when Charles Schulz wrote 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' and 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'. These remain timeless classics and most of the other Charlie Brown specials (except 'A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving') simply do not match the excellence.
Some of the themes of the classics are used again here. The hope of the Easter Beagle arriving is reminiscent of the Great Pumpkin. The crass commercialization of Christmas in the department store, of course, looks back to the Christmas special.
My only real complaint is that there is no discussion of the real meaning of Easter.
That was the central theme of the Christmas special and was boldly answered by Linus reciting from the Bible. The Easter Beagle focuses on Peppermint Patty trying to show Marcie about Easter by coloring eggs while Linus is telling everyone not to bother because the Easter Beagle will take care of it.

Linus' story reminds Sally of the Great Pumpkin just a little too much, but she wants to believe her Sweet Baboo.  Complete with a familiar, though this time subtle anti-consumerism message and an unintentional allegory about faith, IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN is a spring-time treat that families can enjoy watching together.

This remastered deluxe version of IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN also includes a second television special, a special featurette, and a few trailers.  The second Peanuts episode on the disc is IT'S ARBOR DAY, CHARLIE BROWN.  Sally is given a school assignment to research Arbor Day.  Her quest leads her to wanting to plant trees, flowers, and a garden.  Lucy, Linus, and a few others join her and start growing a bunch of plants on Charlie Brown's baseball field.  Charlie Brown is shocked when the season opener against Peppermint Patty's team rolls around and he finds his field has been turned into a garden.  But, the game goes on and surprisingly Charlie Brown's gets a winning run and leads the game.

The featurette on the DVD is ""In Full Bloom: Peanuts at Easter"" offers an inside look at the creation of IT'S THE EASTER BEAGLE, CHARLIE BROWN.  The featurette explores how the special came to me, Schulz's intentions in the making of the cartoon, what people take away from watching it, etc.

Though Snoopy ends up being that very Beagle, he's far too busy trying to help out Woodstock. The poor little bird is freezing in his cruddy little nest full of cold water. So Snoopy goes off to the mall (already advertising Xmas goodies!) to buy him a bird house. With hilarious results.

After much hijinks and endless trips to the mall for eggs (Marcie keeps smashing them as she doesn't know how to do egg-painting) Snoopy saves the day and proves Linus right after all. Sigh! They don't make 'em like this anymore. I'll tale Snoopy over Spongebob any day.

533766,5,6303014887,"The 1970s were the artistic prime for the Peanuts specials, and ""It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown"" is no exception. The voices, animation, and music are all superb. It has some quite funny moments, such as the store having their Christmas decorations up and Marcie's antics with the eggs. I wish some of the music was released on CD (I don't know why it wasn't on Charlie Brown's Holiday Hits). It's a classic perrenial show. Some have disliked the lack of religion, but I think Schroeder's quote, ""It's a time of renewal, a start of spring"" is sufficient.

""It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown"" is a foreshadowing of the poor quality that would come in the 1980s. It was made in 1976, one year after ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"", but the voices aren't as good. The voices are the main problem here (although they're still better than the '80s), but they're not the only one. The backgrounds aren't as good, and the baseball field is more brown than usual, even with all the plants. Even Vince Guaraldi's music isn't quite as lively as usual. Still, this is a good show with some quite funny moments. It is fun to have a special for an obscure holiday, even though I don't know when it is.

I don't understand the relevance of the Charlotte's Web 2 game, other than just commercialism. I think it only works for the three to five age group. A regular advertisement would have been more useful.

Made in 1974 it has every bit of the charm and laughs as those other specials and it's too bad that it doesn't get more notoriety.  They really do not make them like this anymore.

This special is much like ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" in that we again have the ever hopeful Linus, trying to convince the rest of the gang that the Easter Beagle will arrive on Easter Morning to give eggs the kids.  None of the gang are buying it however and they are all off having their own problems.  Peppermint Patty is trying to teach Marcie to color eggs, much to Patty's frustration, Sally has to get some new shoes at the mall, Snoopy wants to get a new bird cage for Woodstock, and Charlie Brown is discouraged to see the stores already advertising for Christmas at Easter time.

This DVD comes with a bonus Peanuts special, ""It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown"".  I guess they were pretty much scraping the bottom of the barrel when they made this one in 1976.  It's not bad mind you, but who celebrates Arbor Day?

Rather, Pepperment Patty is the central figure, as she takes on the challenge of teaching her friend, Marcy, how to color eggs.  The other aspect of this program is that it relies on visual gags and surreal humor to welcome Spring rather than delivering a message as most Peanuts programs do.  It seems appropriate, though, given the feelings evoked by Easter.  As with all Peanuts specials, the color pallette and score of the cartoon beautifully represent the time of year.

While Peppermint Patty is frustrated with trying to teach the conventions of the holiday to Marcie, Linus insists that the Easter Beagle will save the day. The story feels like a hodgepodge of elements form other Peanuts cartoons -- Linuss confusion about holiday icons smacks of Its the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (the twist being that this time, hes right), while Patty and Marcies kitchen mishaps remind me of the fiasco in A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
Its still Peanuts, so its still warm and funny, but its not one of the best.
Oddly enough the back-up cartoon on this DVD IS one of the best. Its Arbor Day, Charlie Brown starts out with a explanation of one of the most superfluous holidays imaginable and turns into a hysterical, well-written and wonderfully entertaining story about Charlie Browns frequent baseball tribulations. His own team seems out to sabotage him this time, turning his baseball diamond into a garden, right down to the tree in the middle of his pitchers mound.

While I was a little surprised and disappointed that the Easter one didn't reference the Biblical story ala A Charlie Brown Christmas, that's a minor point.  I loved every minute of Arbor Day.  It's a more coherent story and has some classic moments.  Plus I learned a little more about this holiday.  (I confess, my knowledge was about like Sally's at the beginning, so anything was better then nothing.)
If you've bought other Peanuts DVD's you know exactly what to expect here.  The picture and sound quality are good, but there aren't any extras.

Will he dance with the bunnies, Peppermint Patty,  Marcy, and even give crabby Lucy a kiss?  Check it out!",956016000,7,721,4.786885245901639
533811,4,6303014887,"""Easter Beagle"" is one of the classic Peanuts TVspecials, and still makes for fun viewing, even more than a quartercentury after its first broadcast. Although the Easter theme seems a bit tenuous at points, we and our kids enjoy watching the Peanuts gang's antics. Indeed, some of the ""surreal"" bits (such as the dancing in the department store) are some of the kids' favorite scenes. And Peppermint Patty's repeated ""AAAAAAUUGH!"" at Marcie's various egg-cooking mistakes never fails to throw our 6-year-old into the giggles.  END",953683200,16,530,5.235294117647059
