8486973,4,B005UNI2UW,Great series. My only problem is that the Japanese audio is 5.1 surround sound. So it sounds really weird coming out of my tv speakers which is only stereo. Same thing with my computer which only has stereo speakers. I don't know why the choice was made to make the Japanese audio playable for only surround sound 5.1. Other than that I have no problems with this.,1412640000,,364,4.447761194029851

8486975,5,B005UNI2UW,"It is an incredible product. The story is impressive and the quality of the Blu-ray is superb. One thing you must know before buying it. Because it is an old series, the aspect of the video is 4:3 no 16:9 or 16:10. If that does not bother you (like me) it is a superb addition to your collection. The image quality is incredible and the dub in English is quite good. As a fan of anime, if you haven't bought this series, what are you waiting for do it.",1384560000,2,452,4.089887640449438
8486976,5,B005UNI2UW,"This is the third box set for The Twelve Kingdoms, and by now you're fully engulfed into the story and get to see some action. Some of the story remains very lethargic, but I still loved the series; most of the time I like to have a varying soundtrack, but it seemed right to have the theme song playing throughout the anime as it had been. No matter what scene they put with it, it just seem to fit.

Just get the anime and watch it all the way through, you won't regreat it at all.",1371340800,,483,4.03125

8486978,5,B005UNI2UW,"This is an amazing anime that I would recommend to anyone.

Amazon has fast shipping, they shipped my copy on 12/15/2011 and it arrived on 12/17/2011.

After watching my copy I found that, like the first and second sets, the picture and sound quality (I watched this blu-ray release in Japanese DTS-HD 5.1 with English subtitles) of this blu-ray set is great!

This set contains episodes 34-45 on 3 discs (there are 45 episodes total in this series, so this is the final set in the series) and staff interviews.",1324944000,17,511,4.655555555555556
