8547708,5,B003HNNEU0,"Saucer Sexodus is a film unlike any you have seen before.  It seems to almost make itself from one scene to the next, almost as if it has taken on a life of its own, and you will have no idea where it is taking you.  Aliens, Shakespeare, sexy babes, twisted dreams, all of this and more lie here, waiting to pounce and take you where Hollywood just can't.  I personally love the works of Jerry Williams and his vision of cinema which is unique in so many ways.  yes, this is a a zero budget affair, but nobody can take nothing and make it into something like Jerry Williams!  Saucer Sexodus is a great escape, and when it concludes, you may not find yourself exactly as you were before.",1386374400,,686,4.246153846153846
