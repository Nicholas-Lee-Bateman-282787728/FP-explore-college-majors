8425361,5,B004DIPLO0,"I don't usually write reviews, but...! I just bought this despite the other review and disagree radically with that person's thoughts. I think this is an inspiring set. The performances are excellent and, above all, joyous. K456 is astonishing - brilliant as music, brilliant as a performance. The filming seems to me ideal, mainly the pianist with the leader of the orchestra behind him adding to the ""conducting"" when necessary - plus occasional highlights on the oboes or the horns or whatever. This to me is exactly what is needed. I enjoyed this as much as the performers obviously did! Badura-Skoda may not be ""one of the greatest pianists"" of today - a note comment that appears to have offended the other reviewer (though I have no doubt this was not said by the pianist!) but he is pretty damn good on this evidence. It is also worth mentioning the beautiful piano he is playing - a Bosendorfer concert grand that seems perfectly regulated and (though, of course, bearing no similarity to what Mozart played) succeeds in sounding exactly right for this music in these hands. I frankly don't care how many DVDs there are, and find the suggestion of someone trying to make people think they are getting a two for one deal quite ridiculous, not to mention irrelevant. Maybe they used a lower compression rate or something - it sounds good to me.",1456444800,2,1351,4.753191489361702
8425362,2,B004DIPLO0,"I remember Paul Badura-Skoda from the 50's and 60's, kind of a journeyman pianist recording for the old Westminster label. I usually prefer to have concertos NOT conducted by the soloist, and the results speak for themselves here. These are just average run-throughs, pleasant enough, but nothing exciting. The sound is good enough but the picture doesn't seem sharp, and the video production very amateurish, like they didn't have enough cameras.

The program is spread over two dvds, which is wasteful, since the whole thing takes less than two hours. Seems like a ruse to make you think you're getting a two-for-one deal.

The accolades in the booklet declaring Badura-Skoda as ""one of the greatest pianists of our time"" seems self-serving and highly exaggerated.

If you want Mozart piano concerti, Buchbinder/VPO on Euroarts dvds are much better.",1299110400,4,851,5.197080291970803
