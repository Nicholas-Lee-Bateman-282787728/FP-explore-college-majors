8229809,2,B000XUCOYC,"There is very little interesting content included in this documentary. The first 2/3 of the video are a complete waste of un-watchable ""off subject"" nonsense. Out of the 58 minutes included in this DVD only about 12 are interesting enough to watch and that is in the very last part of the DVD. I don't write many reviews but I had to write this one so that it might save someone some time, money and frustration.",1329523200,,412,4.434210526315789
8229810,3,B000XUCOYC,"This documentary is a bit of a disappointment because the first 25 min. isn't about Devil's Island or the penal colony. They are about some of the other islands in French Guiana.
After the first 25 min. we finally get to visit Iles Du Salut (Devil's Island, Royale Island, Saint Joseph Island) for the last 30 min. of the documentary. The footage of the former prison barracks and isolation cells, which are now in ruins and overgrown with jungle vegetation, is interesting enough. It's just too bad the first 25 min. of an otherwise interesting documentary is about some completely different islands which have nothing to do with Devil's Island or Iles Du Salut. That's why I can only give it three stars.",1290729600,,706,4.747967479674797
