2512490,5,B000EBD9VW,"The is a stellar example of what can be achieved on a limited budget which is generously compensated by nearly unparalleled actors, writers and directors.

2512492,5,B000EBD9VW,Keith Michell does a stellar job of portraying Henry VIII through out his turbulent life. He is the model all the other actors who play the monarch should follow!,1487808000,,162,4.620689655172414

2512494,5,B000EBD9VW,good history lesson.,1477699200,,20,6.0
2512495,5,B000EBD9VW,I LOVED this series on Masterpiece Theater on PBS years ago. I recorded it back then on VHS tape. It was a poor copy but it was all I had until I purchased this. Wonderful to see this great series in perfect color and audio. It was worth the money.,1476576000,,248,3.98
2512496,4,B000EBD9VW,"This series of plays very rightly deserves it's distinction of ""classic"". Yes, the production is clearly budget; and yes, the make up and cinematography shows its age; but the screen plays, acting, and costumes shine through any 1970's era low budget BBC deficiencies.

That said, this DVD production is downright awful. Most annoying is how the audio leveling is simply non-existent. Keep the remote handy when watching because you'll have the volume at ""100"" for one exchange and ""50"" for the next - within the same scene. It's very, very, very annoying. I have no doubt that the problem came from the BBC trying to go single mic on some of these scenes back in the day to save money - but with today's digital technology rectifying this deficiency should pose no problem.

Further, picture quality is consistent - as in consistently awful. Other reviewers have said that it looks like a bad PAL video to DVD conversion and I have to agree with them. Again digitizing and remastering the source video (the original was clearly a video to film conversion as was common back then) to improve the picture quality would be no problem IF the BBC wanted to invest the money to do so. Apparently they don't, and we all suffer for it. Thanks alot Beeb!

Last but not least is the meager ""Special Features"" disc which should rightly be renamed, ""Worthless Features"". There's nothing here that one can't already find on IMDB or Wikipedia in a richer, more appealing format. And since we were already consulting these sources as we were watching that proved Disc 4 worthless with the exception of the one (that's 1) documentary.

We watched this on the tail end of watching the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius-35th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B006JY3OHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius (35th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the differences couldn't have been more striking. One can only wonder how and why the BBC could do such a fabulous job on the I, Claudius DVDs and such a hack job on the Six Wives of Henry VIII. It's rather heartbreaking.

In the end, if you will watch this with your phone or tablet so you can consult Wikipedia whenever you feel lost or confused by the subplots or story line you will learn a lot - we did. In the end I recommend this production for the performances and the education - it's worth suffering through these horrible DVDs to get them.",1473811200,,2423,5.0475
2512497,5,B000EBD9VW,Really really good.  Each of Henry VIII's wives come through as individuals.,1473465600,,76,5.333333333333333
2512498,4,B000EBD9VW,excellent,1469491200,,9,9.0
2512519,5,B000EBD9VW,"Keith Michell is the top star of this superlative series.  I can only wholeheartedly agree with other reviewers about this excellent, early 1970's BBC program which I saw as a little girl when it hit American shores, then repeated on our local PBS while I was in high school.  As soon as vhs videos became available I bought them, then got the dvd set.  There's also a 1972 major motion picture release made for the Brit-American market starring Michell as the King, but despite better production values it never captured the magic of the ""you are there"" video plays for TV, and the available Region One dvds of the film are of poor, worn-out visual quality.  (and their Anne Boleyn actress had blue eyes, NOT accurate!)

What more can be said about Keith Michell's brilliant depiction of the King? Portrayed truthfully as the handsome young buck turning into a cruel, tyrannical, despotic monarch with unreasonable bigotry about women -- even for the times -- and his railing temper tantrums like an obese angry baby, this gifted actor makes his Henry still comes across as -- dare I say it?  -- a sympathetic character:  amusing, grouchily jolly, always thinking he knows what's best because years of his groveling sycophants told him so.  He turns on a coin to terrorizing his out-of-favor first daughter, the Princess -- or rather, the Lady -- Mary to affably accepting her back into the family fold with the same old sweet fatherly affection he used to display for her, but the underlying menace is:  as long as she obeys him and obsequiously defers to him.  His cooing ""my dears"" to the curtseying girls and women in his circle turn to growls of ""Madammmmmmmm--!"" as soon as they displease him by a mis-spoken word or daring an opinion.  He hollers at and smacks his advisers, ministers, toadying male courtiers when his own inflated egotistical plans don't work out or they offer another suggestion.  And as his unlimited power sours and corrupts him, it soon becomes almost routine to dispatch an unwanted wife or disagreeing subject; pretty soon he can put them to death under the headman's axe (or sword, for the Boleyn's case) with scarcely a shudder of guilt, even if that.  Yet he'll boo-hoo about the religious differences or the disobedient wives causing their own demise:  it's THEIR fault, and they hurt HIM with their supposed disloyalty, lewdness or witchery.  This Henry truly believed that God intended for him to rule this way.

The most hilarious scene is when the King, being groomed by his barber for his unwanted marriage to Anne of Cleves, complains and angrily purses up his mouth into the tight little ""mean"" expression we all recognize from every portrait of Henry VIII.  Michell perfectly imitates the mean little mouth, the cold and crafty glare of eyes.  It's genius.  Another humorous scene is the King wanting to put up his ""sorre legge""-- ""Footstoooool!  Quicklyyyyyy!""  My husband and I have laughed about that one for years.

My only quibble with the wonderful BBC production is -- its production.  The series had to keep costs down and stay within the parameters of the allotted budget, and the supposed-to-be sumptuous costumes proclaim this -- they're mostly made out of the same cheap pale green cloth, with an occasional scarlet or crimson red gown -- actress Sheila Burrell's Lady Rochford (Jane Boleyn) character wears the SAME red dress from 1533 to the year of her execution, 1542, and even the most insignificant courtier would not have gone about with so limited a wardrobe in the King's presence, in or out of favor.  The Jane Seymour episode has ALL of the actors costumed in the same hideous olive green velvet material, which makes the viewer almost nauseated to look at that color on everyone for over an hour.  Only Elvi Hale as Anne of Cleves has the closest replica of the unwanted 4th wife's authentic gowns, depicted in portraits of her:  the rust-orange German dress, and later the balloon-sleeved black-striped-and-saffron Renaissance frock.  Also, Angela Pleasance as Katherine Howard has a couple of scenes where she is outfitted in a stunning gold tissue flocked gown with deep rose-pink petticoat and slashed sleeves also showing the pink of the underdress.  Part of watching ""costume drama"" is for the pleasure of seeing the costumes!

That said, all of the actors looked so much like the real people (especially Cranmer, Norfolk, and Cromwell) with the ladies more than glancingly resembling Henry's Queens, most especially Dorothy Tutin's sharp-eyed, dark-haired Anne Boleyn.  I can't bear to look at any modern films or TV dribble about the Tudors since the sexpot teenybopper actors look nothing at all like any of the real wives.  For that matter, none of those guys looked anything like Henry, either!  This series is the real thing, and the researchers made sure the plays carefully reflected authentic history.",1466121600,,4884,4.940024479804162

2512576,5,B000EBD9VW,"I bought this set years ago and fell immediately in love with both sets.  Perhaps newer editions (if they are re-released) will be video enhanced
to improve the video a bit, but the quality of my discs are quite good.  These were made for Public Television (I think) and were commercial free
(thank God!) and made in six 90 minute episodes in each set.  HENRY was done first and the early epispdes show the budget restrictions but the
cast and acting was superb!  As the series went on budgets obiviously went up and the sets got bigger and more elaborate.  But the stories were
all pretty close to being very accurate.  Even in the costuming, precise detailing seemed in order, even down to the ridiculous ""cod pieces"" the men
wore to ""enhance"" their masculinity.  No other historical dramas of this period were more accurately portrayed.  Henry started out as a handsome
young man, but later became the gross, ugly fatso that even on the teley looked very repulsive: you could almost smell the growing rot in a leg he
injured.  Each episode followed his relationships with his many wifes.  Anne Bolyn was perhaps the most abusive and yet the most innocent of
the ones he killed.  His closest adviser was Cromwell who turned out to be a real slimeball but got his in the end!  Anyone interested in this period
of English history should watch these two sets; ELIZABETH R is the sequel and it is also superb and bit more elaborate then HENRY.
 Elizabeth is also made up of six 90 minute episodes and they cover all the important incidents in her life, from being a frightened young woman,
thru The ARMADA attacks, thru Mary Queen of Scots and a brief love affair that went no where.  She ruled as a great Queen, even with some
apparent flaws, and died a Queen, if the show at the end of the series is correct.  Note there is an excellent portrayal of Mary Queen of Scots
(played by Vanessa Redgrave, very superbly!)  And Glenda Jackson who played ELIZIBETH R in the above mentioned series, reprises her roll
as Elizabeth in this particular drama which I greatly recommend.  The confrontation between her and Mary was something to behold and had
a tear jerking air to the incident.  There are other films about Elizabeth the Queen, one by Cate Blanchard (Galadriel: Lord of the Rings) and a
better one with Helen Millen which almost paralleled the Glenda Jackson versions.  I got my set years go but keep them safe with all my other
historical dramas.  I also recommend MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS portrayed by the great Kate Hepburn.  Excellent and very touching and
sympathetic to Mary, as she was betrayed by her own  countrymen.  Perhaps one could find used set; if not hopefully the English will re-release
them.  These two sets were for the most part video taped, with a few additional seasons on film.  The quality is not HD or what we would expect
today (these were made in  about 1970 or so) but I found the images quite acceptable.  FIVE STARS..I believe I got my sets from AMAZON.",1432166400,,2981,4.6072106261859584

I particularly like this rendition because Keith Michell does such an excellent job portraying Henry VIII.  Not that I would know what Henry VIII was really like, but having read about Henry VIII and his life and personality, you get the sense that Keith's portrayal comes very close to that of the tyrant king.

2512623,4,B000EBD9VW,"I am unqualified to comment on the technical aspects of the DVD production, but would rate the overall DVD quality as 6 or 7 out of 10 for sound, picture and color.  But the fine quality of the content overwhelms this as you watch.  Compared to the Elizabeth R DVDs in the dark green packaging, Six Wives is a degree subordinate.  But, I have watched the entire set back-to-back four times with no skips or stalls, a big plus.

This is an excellent series from an acting perspective.  No one is weak.  Keith Michell and all six wife actors are superb, and the supporting actors no less so. Henry's daughter Elizabeth was a far more complex character, so the Elizabeth R series is more intriguing.  But, again, the Six Wives will not disappoint.

For some reason, the sets seem to improve as the series progresses, with some backdrops obviously a simple scrim.  Henry's costumes outshine all the others.  Perhaps this distinction is purposeful in establishing Henry's comparatively ebullient personality. But, the overall costuming is interesting and adequately establishes suspension of disbelief.  These are, after all, plays filmed for television.

It is great fun to watch and rewatch this series for all the historical references.  A few time throughout the series, though, this creates some tedium.

Several of the actors carry over their roles in the Elizabeth R series.  You will recognize Rosalie Crutchley as the caretaker's wife in the wonderful, original movie of The Haunting. And, a number of the actors also play in the I Claudius series, another one I highly recommend.

 I was a bit wary purchasing the Six Wives of Henry VIII because I love the Elizabeth R series so much.  But, I am glad I did.",1412294400,,1712,4.844827586206897

2512625,5,B000EBD9VW,"This six-part television presentation is excellent.  Provides great insight into each of King Henry VIII's wives and shows how they were pertinent to the changes in the religious make-up of England.  Each part is a show unto itself, so it can be watched over a series of evenings.  The acting is excellent and the costumes lovely, true to the era.  Keith Michell is uniform in his presentation of King Henry VIII throughout all six performances.

These vignettes of 90 minutes are presented as plays and, thus, those used to the modern special effects movies may have to adjust your expectations.  These are well worth watching and have historical value in terms of teaching.

I have read in other reviews complaints as to the quality of the DVD.  In my set, the picture and sound are crisp and clear as a bell.  Several of those reviews were from much earlier and this DVD set was released in 2011, so possibly they cleaned up the original with new technology.",1410652800,,961,4.706586826347305

2512652,5,B000EBD9VW,"Produced in the 1970s, this BBC series is an historically accurate and well-acted account of one of England's most fascinating royals. It is not, however, highly produced, like the more contemporary Showtime extravaganza, The Tudors. You will notice that the scene settings are limited and repeated frequently. As are the costumes. The pace is slow compared with what we have been accustomed to in our video viewing. And the quality of the video shows its age.

But all that said, I have owned this series for years (first a VHS copy and now the DVDs) and have returned to it time and again, whenever I need a Henry VIII fix.

So, my advice is to ignore the pacing, the image quality, and the lack of chapters on the DVDs. Instead, focus on the content. Keith Michell is brilliant, transforming over the six 90-minute episodes, from a young and handsome king full of optimism and Renaissance ideals into the overweight, short-tempered and vengeful monarch he became. All of the wives are portrayed with distinct personalities by exceptionally talented British actresses. If you are fascinated by Henry VIII, you MUST see this.",1403481600,,1126,4.921052631578948

2512655,5,B000EBD9VW,"I have watched this video many times, as I am a real Tudor buff.  All the wives have compelling stories and the stories left me with compassion for each of the wives.  The episodes are mesmerizing in their depiction of the gradual deterioration of King Henry VIII's character and morals, which unfolds gradually throughout the episodes.  My favorite episode, perhaps surprisingly, is the Anne of Cleves story.  Anne of Cleves is probably the wife about whom the least is known, but in her episode she is depicted as tart, resillient, politically astute, caring and generous, and perhaps surprisingly, as more than a match for the by then bloated, arrogant and thoroughly spoiled Henry VIII.  Anne gets her happy ending, in that the monster divorces her, makes a good financial settlement with her, and remains on cordial terms with her as he careens through life with subsequent wives.  The episode is witty and Elvi Hale is both sympathetic and likeable as Anne of Cleves.  There are gems of acting in each of these episodes, and the viewer should not be put off by the dated production values of the series.

2512700,4,B000EBD9VW,"Let's admit right off that this mini-series from 1970 does not LOOK as good as recent productions like The Tudors or The Other Boleyn Girl or the two Elizabeth movies with Cate Blanchett.  The sets are minimal, the lighting is a bit flat, the sound is not of the highest quality.  Still, for some truly memorable acting, working with some very literate scripts, it has no peer.  Keith Michell is probably the best Henry VIII, changing from a slim, soft-spoken but virile youth, deeply in love with his first wife, to a prematurely bald, white-haired ""stinking hill of guts,"" with his temperament changing to match his appearance.  He's mostly an unlikable character (as the real Henry was), yet he's never boring because he's never completely sucked in by his courtiers' phoniness and hidden agendas.  Henry isn't the real villain of the piece, since the villainy is parceled out to his unscrupulous flunkies like Thomas Cromwell and Bishop Gardiner, whose plotting and backstabbing ought to convince that dirty politics is nothing new.  Part of the pleasure in watching is that these sharks end up being eaten themselves, so people who plot others' downfall usually experience the same fate.

The six actresses who play the wives are all superb, especially the late Dorothy Tutin as ill-fated Anne Boleyn, the quintessential ""home-wrecker"" who pays the ultimate price for her scheming.  Anne is hardly a likable character, but Tutin manages to tug on the audience's heart-strings as she meets her end.  Also fine is the very young Angela Pleasance (daughter of Donald Pleasance) as fifth wife Katherine Howard, pretty but also manipulative and scheming and amazingly quick at learning how useful it is in the court to be a convincing liar.  In one scene she soothingly consoles the impotent Henry following their wedding night, but in the next scene breaks down in tears as she tells her maid how disgusted she was at the sight of Henry's aged carcass, so that we almost forgive her for rushing into a very foolish affair with one of Henry's aides, plus we sympathize with her as she is manipulated by her devious uncle the Duke of Norfolk.  The 4th episode, Anne of Cleves, goes off the rails historically, for the real Anne was what we would call an airhead, and she could barely communicate in English, but the episode is interesting as historical fiction, showing the cast-off wife flattering Henry to preserve her own head.

Acting is superb, so are the costumes.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the sets are quite blah, with nary a portrait or a tapestry to be seen anywhere.  But if you focus on the dialogue and the nuances of these fine actors' faces, you'll have a wonderful time.  One reason I don't give this 5 stars is that, alas, there are no subtitles, so someone not well-read in English history is bound to miss a word here and there.  But for the most part the story is easy to follow, and it's an enjoyable way to absorb some fascinating history about a larger-than-life yet very human king and his corrupt court.",1371945600,,3039,4.815384615384615

2512729,3,B000EBD9VW,"The pageantry, magnificent costumes, background music, background setting was gloriously done and made this series far more engaging to view.
The first episode on Catherine of Aragon (played with great pathos and dignity by Annette Crosbie), was sympathetic portrayal and was certainly the best in the series with intelligent dialogue and a real feel for the age. The film certainly captures a sympathy for the dignified stubbornness and total piousness of Henry's first queen, as it does a great performance of the stingy and scheming Henry VII (John Woodnutt). the way the couple grow from being young and attractive into Catherine's older worn character and Henry developing into an overweight scheming tyrant is well portrayed too.
But the scriptwriters in the next few episodes seem to suffer from a rather bigoted and archaic view of women judging with out most sympathy the sexually virtuous and staid such as Catherine of Aragon and Jane Seymour (Anne Stallybrass) and total villification of the two queens who were branded 'whores' and murdered on Henry's orders. i.e the puritnaical old portrayal as women as either vrtuous saints or despicable whores.

I though The Other Boleyn Girl both the book by Philipa Gregory and the movie starring Natalie Portman was unecessarily unsympathetic to Ann Boleyn , going back over 30 years , it has nothing on this series. It is completely sympathetic to Henry , presents Anne as self-serving, scheming and malicious and all but tries to present the case that she deserved to be executed. The truth must have been different.
Katherine Howard played by Angela Pleasance) who was in reality simple and perhaps promiscuous but certainly good hearted and whose cruel fate was perhaps the most callous and detestable of Henry's crimes is here depicted as wanton, scheming, shrewish and everything bad-once again seemingly trying to present the case for Henry and implying she deserved, a victim of power if ever there was one.
Although this series was done in 1970 during the height of the sexual revolution, the writers of these pieces still were coloured by a very dour view.
Anne of Cleeves (Elvi Hale) is presented in top form as witty and clever. The screenplay on her and on Katherine of Aragon are the best done in this series.",1356480000,,2278,5.026455026455026

2512748,5,B000EBD9VW,"History's most famous case of spousal abandonment took place nearly 500 years ago. Henry VIII of England was married to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella (Yup, the same Ferdinand and Isabella who sent Columbus on his supposed 'round the world trip.).  The world and the Church were torn apart (and remain so) by the unbridled selfishness and lusts of Henry VIII, who tried to coerce the Church into giving him an invalid annulment. While Bishop John Fisher and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sir-Thomas-More/dp/0679728228/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sir Thomas More</a>&nbsp;are now recognized as saints for their courageous stands for Truth,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/part-one-of-this-fabulous-BBC-production/dp/6302676185/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">part one of this fabulous BBC production</a>&nbsp;highlights the saintliness of the victim of that abandonment, herself.

On ""K[C]atherine of Aragon: the Official Website for Her Cause,"" there is a position paper on
* ""the central figure of the English Reformation....[who] - for her nearly 36 years in England - embraced the power and comfort of prayer....After nearly twenty years of wedlock, Katharine sat there - stunned - listening to this man whom she adored tell her their marriage was sinful, asking her to go away while the matter was sorted out....She was fearless before men who easily could have done her harm....On 7 January 1536 at age 50 Katharine of Aragon - Queen of England - died. That same day she wrote her final letter to the man who had betrayed her, but whom she still loved. Even with its mild rebukes, it is a letter of love and forgiveness....

* ""easily could she have accepted the title of Dowager Princess of Wales and lived a rich, royal life or retired to a convent. Yet she refused these things because had she not, she would have been untrue to herself, her child, her country, her heritage, her faith, and her God. She was the rightful queen....By taking this course, she trusted to the will of God whatever that course was or where it would take her....It is her cause and her faith that inspired every person who died at the hands of both Henry and later, Elizabeth, to go to their deaths bravely....

* ""Katharine's defense of the sacrament of marriage is perhaps her tie and relevance to the modern world. In an age where the sanctity of marriage is all but disregarded, she stands - 475 years later - as the model defender of the sacrament of marriage....in the last moments of her life she held fast to her faith - forgiving the one person who had betrayed her above all others - yet whom she loved still. This is the essence of holiness - the essence of Jesus's message in the Gospels; the message of love and forgiveness.""

This past March, the Catholic News Agency published an article, which inadvertently reminds us of the relevance of Catherine's heroism and saintliness:
*""There is abundant research to affirm the dire consequences of divorce for children....As Catholics who believe in the sanctity and permanence of the marriage vow, we can understand why things go drastically wrong when that vow is breached....What we may not know is that most divorces are situations in which one person wants to end the marriage while the other is fighting to save it....
*""We must fight our tendency to look the other way in the name of discretion or a false sense of charity....As Catholics, we have moral obligations when we know someone who has abandoned his or her family in order to seek a divorce. We have a duty to stand in solidarity with the spouse who has been left behind, and with any children who might be involved....
*""The message to the abandoner must be this: 'What you have done is contrary to God's plan for you and your family. We are praying you will return home and seek the counseling needed to heal your marriage. Once you decide to return to your family, you will have our full support. Until then, please do not expect us to condone your action by pretending it hasn't happened'....
*""We need a renewed effort on the part of bishops and priests to recognize that spousal abandonment is a crisis in our Church. Church leaders need to acknowledge this -- and they need to encourage new, more effective responses in our parishes and chanceries....In a world that would have us believe that divorce is just an opportunity for a new start, the Church's message must be loud and clear: We will hold fast to our ancient teachings on marriage - for the sake of our souls, our families, and our civilization"" (Hillary Towers, PhD, It is time for the Church to face up to the crisis of spousal abandonment, 3/4/01).",1316304000,,4735,5.065384615384615

2512751,5,B000EBD9VW,"I can not say too much in praise of all the famous BBC historical dramas made in the 1970's, including Henry VIII, Elizabeth R, Fall of Eagles and I, Claudius.
It is a real pleasure to watch Keith Michell's marvelous performance as he goes from being an idealistic, handsome young man to a bloated, diseased, paranoid prematurely old man.
Others have praised this series, so I will mention a few negative points.
(1) I found the first two episodes rather slow moving, with Catherine and Anne Boleyn spending much time saying ""woe is me!"". I prefer the later episodes where there is more court intrigue, politics and fights over the future of the Church of England.
(2) I found the writers didn't really know what to make of Anne Boleyn. At first she seems to be an ambitious, scheming woman who does everything possible to push Catherine of Aragon aside, including supporting the executions of Fisher and Thomas More. Later she becomes something of a shrew, publicly berating her husband for taking mistresses, even though her brother warned her to accept things they way they were and to keep her mouth shut.
At the end, when apparently falsely accused of treason and adultery she becomes a saintly martyr figure who denounces those who conduct the farcical trial and she faces death bravely and with much religious faith.
(3) Thomas Cromwell is a key figure in the reign of Henry VIII. He was a commoner who reached the highest positions of power in the court. Yet, in the Anne of Cleves episode, he seems to turn against his master and accuses him of being a monster, after doing so much to help him in his struggles to break church ties with Rome and to confiscating Church property, in addition to working very hard to remove those prominent people who stood in his way. It is not made clear exactly how the King decided to have Cromwell executed other than we see that the King was angry at Cromwell's pushing Anne of Cleves on him and the fact that Cromwell had many powerful enemies at court. It is said that the King later regretted having him executed.

Having said this, I still find it a real pleasure to watch the series, and I particularly love seeing the costumes which are taken from famous portraits made at the time of the characters. I also like the dances and authentic music of the period.",1294012800,,2310,4.634146341463414

Keith Michell's performance is unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life. Although this phrase may by now be cliche, he seemed to be channeling the corpulent king from beyond. So many scenes deserve recognition, but one in particular struck me; that of his 'failure to perform' on his marriage night w/ teen bride Catherine Howard. How Michell's eyes so perfectly reflected the shame and defeat of this once prodigiously virile savage was beyond brilliant. Additionally, each wife was played to perfection, especially Anne Stallybrass' Jane Seymour and Elvie Hale's Anne of Cleves.

Keith Michell's Henry the Eighth greatly overshadows Charles Laughton's Oscar-winning portrayal of this monarch.",1243555200,,600,5.56043956043956
2512791,5,B000EBD9VW,"When Tudors showed each week, I remembered a BBC series I enjoyed in the 70's about Henry VIII.  I ordered it and enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw it.  The series was the first of it's kind and was a big deal back then.  Here in 2009, the series seems very old fashioned, but it was factual and I think the costumes are better than the Tudor series.  Keith Mitchell, who played Henry, was made to look exactly like the king, which made it believable.  Keith Mitchell also acted brilliantly in the different physical changes the actual king went thru and I think, after Henry's accident to his leg and getting obese and his wound so putrid all the time, how did those poor young women that he married, endure it!  If anyone wishes to buy this series, I think you will feel as though you are actually looking thru a window and watching the great Henry himself. This is one memory lane that I love to stroll down! Excellent!  Also, at this time, a weekly series of Elizabeth R came out on BBC.  Glenda Jackson portrays her exactly how she really looked.

The series is brilliantly acted by everyone. It is accurate regarding clothing, hair styles, etc. Pains were taken to ensure that the actors closely resembled the historical figures according to their portraits.
Henry was visibly aged as the years went by.
Those having prurient interest will be a little disappointed, as Henry apparently was a private man regarding his personal sexual exploits.
This is a more historical performance, full of political intrigue, jockeying for power, and using daughters to achieve political power.
The series is excellent in every way.

2512794,4,B000EBD9VW,"The precursor to another fantastic BBC production (Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson), ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" chronicles the life of the volatile and controversial Tudor monarch. 6 series, written by 6 authors, showcase Henry VIII from a young boy of around 8, to the disease-riddled, corpulent and (rather) pitiful king of 55 (almost 56) upon his death.

Keith Michell plays the titular character to astounding perfection. Highlighting his extreme moodiness (when he was up, he was way UP, when he was down, he liked to BEHEAD), limitless power in his own kingdom, Michell's Henry VIII was a veritable enigma of a man and monarch. The casting choice of Michell was spot on, and the costuming/makeup departments must be commended for their close attention to detail. The aging process of Michell's King Hal is fantastic (I especially enjoyed the quite hefty Henry-in his later years-being hoisted onto his horse by a pulley system).

The women playing his wives are an especial treat. Annette Crosbie (Katherine of Aragon) and Dorothy Tutin (Anne Boleyn) may have been too mature looking to play a 15 and 19 year old respectively, but both are pitch perfect as they play these powerful women in their later years. Tutin's lightly accented English (which Anne Boleyn was noted for, due to her years spent in the courts of Austria and France) was quite a nice touch for the production and research teams.

Anne Stallybrass (Jane Seymour) truly captured Henry's 3rd queen's quiet and meek spirit. Speaking barely above a whisper, and averting her gaze constantly, she transforms herself into the plainest of Henry's consorts (although, supposedly, his most ""beloved""-although that may have been due to the fact that her son, Edward VI, survived). Elvi Hale (Anne of Cleves) provides the most comic relief during her entire screen time. Utilizing a (ridiculous) German accent, her facial expressions belie her every emotion. I had a laughing fit when she views Henry in his ""courtier's"" garb for the first time and says ""oh!!"" Absolute hilarity.

Wife number five, Angela Pleasance (Catherine Howard), exhibits a bit of a mean streak against her housemates, and lies to her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, about her virtue. The only wife of Henry VIII to actually ""stray,"" Pleasance shows a fine maturity for such a young actress. Finally, Rosalie Crutchley (Catherine Parr) is a paragon of virtue, learning, and family life. The queen responsible for bringing Elizabeth I back into Henry's good graces, does not want to marry him, but does her duty, and finds herself extremely fond of her husband, and devastated (in her own way) upon his passing.

The BBC probably spared no expense (in 1973 currency) during the filming of ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII,"" but the film does show the wear of time. Restoration would enhance the color and sound quality, but this is still a 4.5 star effort because of the extremely talented cast and the lovely detailed touches of the crew.",1233532800,,2971,4.993939393939394
2512795,4,B000EBD9VW,"This production may seem a little dated, but it is very well-acted. The costumes became more elaborate with each segment. I enjoyed the segments with scenes shot outdoors.

2512796,5,B000EBD9VW,"I am so glad to hear this series is now available on DVD!! I recall watching this wonderful series on our little 19"" black and white TV in 1971  and have raved about it to people ever since whenever anything Tudor-related is brought up. The acting was so good, and the history of the times was respected.

One reviewer mentioned that the DVD needed freshening. Hers was a 2000 release, while this is a 2006 release, btw.

It got me hooked on Tudor history. Since then in my opinion, its hard to find anything in film or historical non-fiction books that don't make me want to wince...or worse.

Phillipa Gregory should be ashamed of herself, I think anyway.  The only good thing about her books being best-sellers is perhaps some people will go on to read better written, more accurate Tudor history or historical fiction.

As for other older films:  ""Man of All Seasons"" feels dated, as does ""Anne of a Thousand Days"" but they're at least good entries into the field, and were well made. Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth I"" sold as a package with the ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" was excellent, though I read in reviews it appears more dated than the Henry VIII films do. Its's nevertheless a great acting experience to watch.

I found the two Elizabeth movies starring Cate Blanchett released in the last few years to be discouraging. Many things were correct historically: the lovely clothes, the feel of the great icy cold castles, the constant fear of being ""out of favor"" and risking death thereby; but others were so far off, it felt like a ""just miss"" to me.

....Of course, wondering how serious Elizabeth's relationship with Robert Dudley was is one of those popular and never-to-be-known historical questions. That movie, however, with its' silly concept that Elizabeth I decided to recreate herself as the ""VIRGIN QUEEN"" for all time; a sort of symbol for...something..is ludicrous. She certainly spent a lot of time considering marriage for someone determined to be remembered as the ""Virgin Queen"".

The movie made from the Phillipa Gregory book....much was historically based but SO MUCH was based on rumor and theory---some from the time of the Tudors themselves.  Its' too distressing. Makes me feel how I felt when I first read the ""DaVinci Code"". History for the lowest common denominator, and wild theories presented as facts...!

In this ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" series, at last we have available good acting, good story telling, honest history, (so far as it is known) and a story that really holds you. Henry's tragedy, his desire for a son and heir, changed all of English history and perhaps even that of W.Europe, as he threw over Catholicism to allow him to marry a younger woman who might give him a son. The tragedies build up, as each queen has some flaw, major or minor, that he cannot abide. THEY of course, were even more tragic figures, losing one's head is after all a bigger tragedy than someone's longing for a male heir. But the women are seen as minor creatures in the big play of history while Henry VIII remains important, a major factor in events of his time and even down to ours, due to his decision to remake the entire religion (and in some ways the culture) of his lands.

A well written, well acted piece of film craft that anyone who is interested in that era should own.",1230249600,,3313,4.701208981001727
2512797,3,B000EBD9VW,"I thought this was OK but have a few reservations about the actresses who played his wives. The woman who played Catherine of Aragon was not very believable and over-acted way too much when she screamed histrionically at being told of Henry's intention to divorce her. And the actors who played the German Cleves family (Duke and two daughters Anna and Amelia) had the most ridiculous accents, which only distracted from the drama. I doubt Ann of Cleves was as stupid as they portrayed her, but in this miniseries she comes across as almost mentally retarded.",1227312000,,559,4.833333333333333

I had never before seen costumes like the ones in ""Six Wives"", so authentically reproduced that the actors wearing them look as if they had stepped right out of the paintings of Hans Holbein. There's no more perfect Henry VIII than Keith Michell, who flawlessly portrays the monarch from a slender, idealistic 18-year-old youth to a grossly fat, paranoid, and diseased old man of 55.  The actresses who portray his six wives - Annette Crosbie, Dorothy Tutin, Anne Stallybrass, Elvi Hale, Angela Pleasence, and Rosalie Crutchley - give dazzling, deeply nuanced performances as six queens of differing appearances, ages, backgrounds and personalities, with Henry VIII as the link that connects them all together. I was overjoyed when PBS aired ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" in late 1971, and even happier when it was followed in early 1972 by a second Tudor-themed mini-series: ""Elizabeth R"".",1215302400,,1086,4.896739130434782

All of the actresses and actors are brilliant. Some have not been seen since this series others went on to become well known in their own right.

The program was classic BBC/Masterpiece Theater in the old days. Along with such programs as I Claudius, Edward the King, and Elizabeth R.

2512821,5,B000EBD9VW,"This is just a great production of The Six Wives of Henry VIII.  It was sensational in 1970 (in the US, 1972) and is sensational now.  The restoration is very good and I appreciate the work that went into it.  Some people may be put off by the videotape and stark lighting and contrasts but the BBC didn't have much money.  You can still see a bit of problem today with production values.  They just don't have as much money.
What the BBC does have is dedication to quality shows, acting, writing and direction.  This show is beautifully written and acted at every turn.  The direction is fine also.  It is difficult to create a 90 minute production out of every wife Henry had.  All the wives get equal time here.  Catherine was Henry's wife for many years.  Instead of only showing the end of their marriage, the show also brings out what she went through before she married him.  He made her wait 7 years before he finally committed himself to marry her and she lived off of the dowry she was supposed to give him.  She couldn't leave because of the disgrace of being rejected.  Catherine was married to Henry's brother but he died shortly after at age 15.  Anne, the most pivotal marriage is picked up after the wedding.  The marriage ultimately lasted only two and a half years.  Jane lasted a year and the episode about her is very poignant since she died giving birth to a son for him.  Anne of Cleves was a washout.  He married her for only 5 months and she was lucky to escape with her head and volunteered to take care of his children.  Catherine got her head chopped off, her cousin was Anne Boleyn, didn't she think?  Catherine Parr could have got her head chopped for conflicts with religion.  She was lucky.  All the wives get 90 minutes and their stories are quite interesting.  Watch!",1211673600,,1800,4.450920245398773

2512823,5,B000EBD9VW,"I love this series. Keith Michell's portrayal of Henry Tudor from a young man to an aging monarch is astounding.

I first saw this production on TV as part of Masterpiece Theatre, and the images I saw were produced by 1970s technology. So I'm not going to complain about not seeing what I never saw anyway. (I actually own the DVD set, but our player died, so I haven't seen it yet. But the picture HAS to be better than the one on my parents' TV set.)

As for the production values, *I* thought they were good. I've heard the same quibble about my all-time Masterpiece Theatre favorite, the brilliantly written, brilliantly acted ""I, Claudius"". But I HAVE recently viewed *that* series, and didn't find the production ""stagey""-looking at all, then or now, so I really don't know that the fuss is about. But then, I'm a boomer; I grew up without CGI and don't feel I'm the worse for it. I'm just grateful that the recording is available.

Like ""I, Claudius"", the segments (one to each wife) are cleverly written and well acted. To me, Michell is the definitive Henry. All of the episodes are marvellous, but the episode closest to my heart is that devoted to Henry and Anne of Cleves, Wife Number 4.

This is not ""The Tudors,"" currently showing on cable TV(is it me, or anyone else here confused about which actor is supposed to be Henry? I've only seen a couple of early episodes).  But then, ""The Six Wives of Henry VII"" set the benchmark, and set it high indeed.

2512825,4,B000EBD9VW,"This series ushered in the British television invasion to America.  But what was interesting was that it was original broadcast on CBS not PBS!

This also was a departure in normal British programming by having each episode written by a different person.

Each episode examines one of the marriages of the most famous King of England.  The format of most starts with the beginning of the relationship through the end of the marriage.  For Catherine of Aragon, it goes past the divorce to her death in 1536. And for Anne Boleyn, it starts after the death of Catherine of Aragon. (Of course Catherine Parr outlives Henry.)

Keith Michell plays Henry (1491-1547) from a young boy to his death (King 1509-1547)  He is very convincing and deserved his Emmy Award (for Actor in a Special not for the entire series.)

The six actresses that played the wives were uniformly excellent but interestingly most were too old for their roles (Dorothy Tutin was almost 40 when she played Anne Boleyn who died at 36.)

Annette Crosbie leads off as Catherine of Aragon (Q 1509-1533), the queen that split the nation and gave Britan Bloody Mary (ended in divorce)(Written by Rosemary Anne Sissons)

Dorothy Tutin is Anne Boleyn (Q 1533-1536), the most famous of the queens and mother of future ruler Elizabeth I (beheaded) (Written by Nick McCarty)

Anne Stallybrass is Jane Seymour (Q 1536-1537), the true love of Henry and mother of his only son Edward I (died as a result of childbirth) (Written by Ian Thorne)

Elvi Hale is Anne of Cleves (Q 1540), Henry's second political marriage and the wife who outsmarted him (ended in divorce II) (Written by Jean Morris)

Angela Pleasence is Catherine Howard (Q 1540-1542), Anne Boleyn's cousin and she actually committed adultrey, (beheaded) (Written by Beverly Cross)

Rosalie Crutchley is Catherine Parr (Q 1543-1547), Henry's last wife, although she nearly met the same fate as Boleyn and Howard. She survived her famous husband and secretly married Thomas Seymour (brother of Jane) but died a 17 months after the death of her famous husband. (Written by John Prebble)

Since in America we do not study alot of British history, this series gives a detailed look at the private life of one of the most infamous English rulers.

The only thing that was not clear was Henry was married to Catherine of Aragon for 20 years.

Also, the color on this is muted.  As it has been over 35 years since I saw this on TV, I am not sure if this is a poor transfer or just the fact that this series was filmed on video instead of film.

2512851,4,B000EBD9VW,"I never let my graduate degrees in history spoil my enjoyment of historical drama, both on screen and in novels. True, I could pick nits in chronology and other areas but that would spoil the fun. So I watch them, or read them, and just plain enjoy most of them.

This one is a standout. Although it is impossible to show an entire reign in 90-minute segments, each of these six dramas does a great job of showing significant areas in the lives of Henry and his six wives. We see Henry grow from youth (but with an unfortunate wig) to old age -- his intellectual prowess in theology, languages, music; his physicality and athletic feats. In spite of his genuine intellectual gifts, however, he was erratic, temperamental, inconsistent, vain. Given the scope of events during Henry's reign, it is often difficult to realize how short his life was. He became king at 17, married Catherine of Aragon at 18, and died at 56.

I am always amazed at how well the British do these historical dramas, especially their ability to find excellent actors who can be made to look very much like the people they portray, down to details of clothing and jewelry seen in portraits.

Keith Michell is superb as Henry VIII -- but over the top? Well, it's an accurate portayal. Henry himself was over the top in everything he did, whether debating theology, coping with ambitious couriers, eating and drinking, in dress, chasing women, you name it -- a true loose cannon in every sense. The six wives are very good too, with Annette Crosbie a standout as Catherine of Aragon. The casts are full of wonderful character actors. The late Patrick Troughton, who played the scarily cold and ambitious Duke of Norfolk, is a favorite of mine. I first saw him as the scatty Second Doctor and didn't realize how good an actor he was until I saw him in other roles.

The stories themselves are well written, although I thought the one about Anne Boleyn dwelt too long on grisly torture scenes and her imprisonment and execution. It was probably also a little difficult to write about Catherine Howard, since we don't know enough about her to know whether she was motivated by lust or fear of not producing an heir or simply not being well enough educated to hold her own in Henry's court. She was also very young, probably not 21 yet when she was executed. It would have been interesting to show that Anne of Cleves survived Henry, living happily and peacefully in England for the rest of her life, long enough to see his daughter Mary crowned Queen.

The reason I didn't give this DVD set a 5-star rating is that it includes as an extra the soap opera-like episode about Mary Boleyn, sister of Anne, apparently filmed later. Mary was Henry's mistress before Anne, but she didn't last long. This was a bad choice for an inclusion and adds nothing to the series other than bad writing, a lot of nudity and sex, and poorly cast characters. It would have been far better to leave it out and include interviews with the actors or other material about the making of the series.

All things considered, however, I would highly recommend this set to anyone who loves lavish historical drama.",1179446400,,3154,4.623214285714286

Catherine looks at least 30 at the beginning when she is supposed to be 16.  And the worst part was that this series was downright boring.

2512854,4,B000EBD9VW,"Because the quality of this series widely from play to play (each was written by a separate author; this teleplan was used again in ""Elizabeth R"" to a rather more unified overall effect), I'll break my review down disc by disc.

Disc one, unfortunately, gets the series off to quite a dismaying start.  Annette Crosbie was very well cast, and the opening scenes were absolutely engaging ... unfortunately, a good dozen or more years are entirely skipped over, while an ugly and annoying montage sequence of dreamy 70s filtered fantasy dancing stretches ad nauseum between romance and disillusion.  What a shame and a waste - to simply leave out the central years of Henry VIII's marriage with Katherine of Aragon.  Nothing at all new was folded into the first play, and that was disappointing.  The second play on the disc is Ann Boleyn, and its script is rather more engaging, though - oddly enough - the noticeably awful set design from episode one is really magnified to shocking proportions here.  (I know the budget was low, but we had low budgets in high school and did not resort to rendering brick walls by way of dipping sponges in paint and pressing them to soft flats.)  Distracting, and just awful!  Just as distracting:  I am sorry, but Dorothy Tutin was by far too old for the role of Ann Boleyn.  This suspended my ability to be lost completely.  Fortunately, the third act of Ann Boleyn is gripping enough to (barely) overcome this failure in window-dressing and casting, and I realized the next disc might redeem the series.

Did it ever.  Jane Seymour has never interested me as a historical figure, but the third episode was entirely absorbing.  Keith Michell comes into total ownership of his role, no longer saddled with a pageboy wig and the task of playing twenty years his own junior.  Anne Stallybrass is so convincing and fully realized in the role of Jane, the short-lived ""favorite"" is rendered fascinating.  The somewhat dated sound design, using a synthesized heartbeat to punctuate the action, actually works - very well.  Production design is vastly improved at this point, including more outdoor scenes as well.  Moving into Ann of Cleves, we get a tour de force not only of fantastic casting and performances, but also of historical fiction at its brilliant best.  The relationship as here written is entirely believable, and yet not based on established history.  I think this is the best play of all six, simply for exemplifying the finest melding of entertainment with history.  There are moments of absolute pathos right next to scenes of intellectually satisfying conjecture.  Absolutely wonderful!

Disc three includes Catherines Howard and Parr, both perfectly cast and again beautifully balanced.  I was excited to see a certain minor but very real strain of bloodthirst in the Rose Without a Thorn - what a dimension to include, and how very well Angela Pleasance handles it!  She was a marvel of everything Catherine Howard is said to have been - both foolish and conniving, naive and (unexpectedly) terribly intelligent.  It was a pleasure to see a smart Catherine Howard for a change, and the flaws which were her downfall are portrayed probably more believably than in any other fiction I've read or watched where she appears.  Rosalie Crutchley, too, delivers a performance as Catherine Parr which brings her page in history authentically and credibly to life.  When one is reading a history of Henry's wives, the tension often flags by the time we reach Parr.  The writer of this episode was clearly not so bored - and this play may be one of the most harrowing.

As to the bonus material, there was not an abundance - and the inclusion of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was a miscalculation.  It was so bad as to make disc one an enviable memory - and, indeed, I'm considering purchase of the older, non-BBC version of this series, simply because it does not include this particular ""bonus"".  Stylistic choices are all very well, but right now, with the proliferation of Reality TV, I get quite enough disingenuous personal monologues delivered straight to a camera.  Badly cast, badly costumed, uninterestingly designed overall, and embarrassingly written above all (the source material is no better), this lion's share of the bonus disk appears like a naked emperor next to the series itself - which, by and large, is pretty well clad by comparison.",1172016000,,4394,4.902571041948579
2512855,5,B000EBD9VW,"I was only 13 when this series aired on TV back in 1971. Others have mentioned seeing it on PBS, but I clearly remembering it first airing in the U.S. on network TV - I'm fairly sure it was CBS - back in the summer of 1971. Isn't it amazing that in 30 years we went from great historical drama being summer TV fare to schlock like Survivor and Fear Factor?

At any rate, this series stars actors and actresses that Americans have probably never seen before since this was entirely a British production. It consists of six episodes - one for each wife - each running 90 minutes in length.  My favorite episodes were those about the second and fifth wives - Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard, respectively. Dorothy Tutin plays the long pursued and then quickly rejected Anne Boleyn, mother of the future Elizabeth I. She is executed on trumped up charges merely because she had failed to produce a male heir and Henry could never come up with an excuse for another divorce just a few years after the first one to Catherine of Aragon. How ironic that it was Anne's daughter Elizabeth - not Henry's son Edward - that was the strong and able monarch and heir Henry had hoped to produce, and the one to clean up the mess he made of England's treasury when she assumed the throne. Katherine Howard, Henry's fifth wife, is the other wife that is executed, although the charges of adultery against her are true. Mitchell does an outstanding job of playing the heartbroken king when he learns of Howard's treachery. The thing is, Katherine Howard's treachery is not so much that as it is the expected outcome of a young healthy 17 year-old girl married to an old man 30 years her senior who can no longer be a real husband to her. She was truly a tragic figure, but typical of that era - a young girl treated as a commodity by her family and placed in an arranged marriage. It is odd that with all of the intelligent and beautiful wives that Henry had, the one that had his heart until the day he died was the shy and plain Jane Seymour, his third wife, mother of his only son, and the only one of his six wives to die a natural death while still his wife.
.
Through all six episodes Keith Mitchell plays Henry the VIII with all the conceited, bombastic, loving, hating and self-indulging qualities that history describes him as having. This is a must-see for lovers of drama, romance, and English history. If you enjoy this series, you might want to consider watching ""Elizabeth R"", starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth I. Both of these series are excellent, but that is the one that people have remembered over the years, plus it won an Emmy for Best Drama.",1169251200,,2648,4.4690082644628095

I loved everything to do with the British monarchy at that time and was quite familiar with it.  The acting is absolutely wonderful, the sets and costumes authentic.

2512857,5,B000EBD9VW,"Isn't it amazing how superb acting, solid writing, and sumptuous costumes can still stand alone?  Each of these 90-minute dramas is a treat in and of itself, but watched successively, they draw the viewer into a world long gone.  The title of the collection is ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII,"" and each drama is focused on one of Henry's wives, but the genius of this undertaking is keeping the astounding Keith Mitchell, who will always stand as the definitive Henry, as the king throughout the series.  He believably plays Henry from a beardless 17-year-old to a raddled old man and shows Henry in all his glory.  He changes the most physically during the Catherine of Aragon episode, but he continues to evolve throughout the drama.  The supporting characters are so well done- well, I could literally write about this drama for days.  If you are at all interested in Tudor-era history, this video collection is a must-own.",1159833600,,924,4.8164556962025316
2512878,5,B000EBD9VW,"I saw this series as a child, and it profoundly influenced my life, making me an eager historian and costumer ever after. Just a year or so ago, my brother gave this series to me as a gift, and it is even better than I remembered it.

The reign of the Tudors followed the War of the Roses, a bloody, chaotic part of British history, characterized by civil war and royal asassinations. The two little princes in the Tower, murdered by order of Richard III, were Henry VIII's uncles. His father, Henry VII, ended the strife by defeating Richard III, and marrying the Yorkist heir, Elizabeth. Their union brought stability to England.

You have to keep these events in mind when watching this series, because they make Henry VIII's actions understandable. His seemingly monomaniacal need for a son was his effort to ensure that nothing like the War of the Roses would happen again.

This series is for the serious Tudor buff. It comes from the era of BBC productions that were richly intellectual, subtly acted and true to the original material. Also, looking at it again after so many years, I realize what a parade of first class British actors participated: Annette Crosbie, Dame Dorothy Tutin, Patrick (""Dr. Who"") Troughton, Bernard Hepton, and even Mollie (""Are You Being Served"") Sugden.

Keith Michell delivers a Henry VIII whom you can hate and yet sympathize with--very human, sometimes weak, sometimes funny. He is a scholar, musician, knight, statesman, victim, tyrant, penitent, cuckold, and philosopher, as events dictate. His Henry is very complex; and one of the pleasures of this production is that you find yourself watching to see which Henry is going to emerge. One can imagine that his wives and courtiers also walked on eggshells, not knowing which facet of his personality might turn itself in them at any given time.

Of the six episodes:

CATHERINE OF ARAGON: Though Catherine is my favorite of the wives, I don't think this is the best episode, because it has to cover over 25  years of history in a few hours. Annette Crosbie does a fine job of portraying the proud, honorable Catherine. She even resembles portraits of the amber-haired princess. This should really have been 2 episodes. What is there is excellent. What's missing is more of Catherine's large part in the govenment of the realm, a more thorough characterization of Wolsey, of Catherine's father Ferdinand's duplicity, and how both of them in their different ways helped undermine her relationship with Henry. It's a pity Catherine was short-changed in this series, because she's the most interesting of the wives--the only woman Henry VIII really feared, and the only one who could have taken his throne away from him, had she chosen.

ANNE BOLEYN: Dorothy Tutin does an excellent job of portraying the historical Anne--not the romance-novel heroine, but the bitch-siren-victim who comes through from contemporary documents and accounts. Without ignoring the ruthless side of her character, she is able to also show a sympathetic Anne as she realizes that her star is on the descendant, and that she is following in the footsteps of Catherine, her deposed predecessor. Anne's notorious rages and hysterical fits are brilliantly done by Ms. Tutin--the terror of a woman who realizes that she's caught in a trap of her own making.

JANE SEYMOUR: This is the episode that won an award. It is sensitively done. Very little is known about Jane Seymour, beyond the fact that she was basically a pawn for her powerful family, and that she bore Henry the son he longed for. However, Anne Stallybrass renders a deeply-felt portrait of the kind woman who made peace between Henry and his daugther Mary, and somehow left an unforgettable impression on Henry himself. In this episode, too, we get an interesting view of the cryptic character of Thomas Cromwell (as portrayed by Wolfe Morris) --an urbane, nervous little man with an unsettling habit of suddenly turning lethal.

ANNA OF CLEVES: So little is known about this wife that I can't justly complain over the liberties the script writer took with her story and character. I think this is the weakest of the series, because it tries too hard to turn Anna into a modern woman. It seems that they were inspired by ""The Private Life of Henry VIII""--the wedding night scene owes some of its comedy to Elsa Lancaster and Charles Laughton. That said, it's thoroughly enjoyable. I also enjoy the final dinner scene between the happily to-be-divorced couple. In historical fact, once they were divorced, they became good friends. A nice sideline is Mollie Sugden's turn as Anna's maid Lotte. There are one or two scenes where you can see that Mrs. Slocom look on her face, and I quite long to hear her tell Henry to ""Shut your cake hole!""

CATHERINE HOWARD: This was the sleeper for me. I'd fogotten how good Angela Pleasance was in the role of the teenaged girl who is made the pawn of the Howard family, and married to the aged Henry VIII. Her monologues are intensely felt and thrilling--reminiscent of her dad's account of first meeting Michael Meyers in ""Halloween"". Patrick Troughton as the hard-edged Duke of Norfolk is brilliant, too. And the broken-down Henry, thoroughly pathetic.

CATHERINE PARR: Henry finally acts his age, and marries a widow, the covertly Protestant Catherine Parr. She is portrayed by the classically beautiful Rosalie Crutchley, who is convincing as the stable, kind woman who brought Henry's family all together again, and won the love of his children. One of the best dialogues is at the very beginnng of this episode, between Henry, who is trying to ask Catherine to marry him, and Catherine, who is trying to dodge the question. It's so well-written and funny, that after 10 viewings, it still makes me laugh.

This is a long review, but the gist of it is this--somehow, get a hold of this monumental production, and watch it. You'll learn something, not the least of which is-- What makes great drama.",1157328000,,5966,4.906746031746032
2512879,5,B000EBD9VW,"THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII  *****

This is a series of six individual plays that focuses upon each of the six wives of King Henry VIII of England. Written by six different playwrights, they are uniformly excellent. While the production values are not high, that is because these plays were part of a televised series for which there were budgetary constraints. Although the makeup is noticable, the sets are uninspired, and the lighting is harsh, the costumes, however, are gorgeous. More important, the acting is superb.

King Henry VIII is played to perfection by Keith Mitchell. He has set the standard by which all others in the part will be judged, and he is the linchpin around whom the entire series revolves. He plays the young, athletic, erudite, golden king in the first tape, and the viewer watches him age and deteriorate throughout the entire series, until he finally becomes the sore riddled, morbidly obese, self absorbed, tyrannical hulk of his later years.

Each one of the six wives has her own unique story. The plays tell that story, each a first rate drama unto itself that segues into the next one seamlessly. All the queens are portrayed by very talented thespians, and the supporting cast is superlative. All in all, this series provides a fully absorbing historical drama that should not be missed. It is through the story of each of the wives that one is able to see England transform itself from a catholic country to a protestant one. It also provides a birdseye view of the political intrigues that fueled the Reformation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

ELIZABETH R  *****

This Masterpiece Theatre, six play series of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England is magnificent. Written by six different playwrights, they are uniformly excellent. Glenda Jackson reigns supreme in the role of Elizabeth I.

While the production values are not high, that is because these plays were part of a televised series for which there were budgetary constraints. The shift from indoor sets to outdoor scenes is awkward, as it entails a switch from tape to film. The stage makeup is noticeable, as the lighting is harsh and glaring. Although the sets are a stark and dreary backdrop, the costumes are sumptuous and gorgeous. More important, the acting is, at all times, superlative.

Elizabeth I is played to perfection by Glenda Jackson. She has set the standard by which all others who seek to reprise this role will be judged, and she is the linchpin around which the entire six play series revolves. She begins the series playing Elizabeth as the young woman who would be queen, waiting upon the whims of her sister, the Queen Mary, and trying to survive the political intrigues and plots which surround her and threaten her very existence. The threat dissipates upon Mary's death, though it never disappears, and she becomes Queen of her beloved England.

As the series progresses, one sees her mature and resist the overtures and attentions of would be husbands, preferring, instead, to be married to England. One sees the development of her political and diplomatic acumen, as she sublimates her personal desires to become the greatest monarch, male or female, England has ever known, The Virgin Queen.

Each one of the plays has its own unique story to tell about Elizabeth and is a first rate drama that segues seamlessly into the next. The supporting cast is superb. All in all, this series provides a fully absorbing, historically accurate drama. It is through Ms. Jackson's insightful and commanding performance that one is able to understand why Elizabeth I was responsible for ushering in England's golden age.",1154822400,,3677,5.019704433497537

Six episodes, six writers, a mini-play for each wife, the result is a towering theatrical experience. Almost imperceptibly, Catherine of Aragon's shadow drifts across the film, an unadorned presence, indicating the pungent intelligence behind the whole enterprise.

2512884,3,B000EBD9VW,"""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" is the original BBC series of six 90 minute plays chronicling the reign and marriages of England's King Henry VIII. Each of the six plays or segments,  ""Katherine Aragon"", ""Anne Boleyn"", ""Jane Seymour"", ""Anne Of Cleves"", ""Catherine Howard"" and ""Catherine Parr,"" is written by a different author. The series was released to great popular and critical acclaim in 1971 and televised on PBS' Masterpiece Theater. This is a three-disc DVD boxed set, with two 90-minute teleplays per disc (one per spouse). Keith Michell is outstanding as the multiple-married monarch. From a boisterous, athletic, handsome Hal, at the time of his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, (Annette Crosbie), the superb Michell, and make-up, transform the king before our eyes to a porcine, tyrannical, and sickly ruler. Although each drama is limited in scope due to time restrictions, the monarch's personal and political reasons for selecting and/or rejecting, (or beheading), his spouses are depicted to some extent.

""My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He was a blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.""  Thus Mark Twain describes our protagonist in ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" As this series demonstrates, Henry was not quite the womanizer he is reputed to be. He was married to Katharine of Aragon for over twenty years and had just a few mistresses before this - unusual for a prince.  He waited years to physically consummate his relationship with Anne Boleyn, and remained faithful to her until marriage.

Each of the actresses who play Henry's wives was able to find the core of her historical character, her queen, and lend the woman an air of dignity and individuality. Annette Crosbie is magnificent as Katherine of Aragon, the first wife. Her role is the largest as her relationship with Henry VIII was the longest. Dorothy Tutin is a most credible Anne Boleyn, but little time is spent on her very romantic courtship by the king. Most of Anne's story is focused on the role her marriage played in Henry's divorce and the split with the Catholic Church, which sets the stage for the English Reformation. Anne Stallybrass is Jane Seymour, who is extremely important in Tudor history because she is the only wife who gives Henry a male heir. He always said he loved Jane the best and was buried beside her. I wonder if she was so favored because she played such a small part in her husband's life, not only time-wise - she died from puerperal fever after only seventeen months of marriage - but because she was a sort of ""homebody."" After some minor political meddling, Jane was warned by the king to stay away from politics, and reminded of her predecessor's fate. She learned her lesson and no longer interfered in the monarch's affairs. Elvie Hale is Anne of Cleves, the most politically astute of Henry's wives, and certainly the one with the best survival skills. She was glad, ultimately, to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head. Catherine Howard, Henry's ""blushing rose without a thorn,"" is played to the hilt by Angela Pleasence, and her's is a terribly tragic tale. And Rosalie Cruthley plays the part of the brilliant and intellectual Catherine Parr extremely well. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, especially Bernard Hepton as Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, Wolfe Morris as Thomas Cromwell, and Verina Greenlaw as Princess Mary.

I think, overall, that this is an excellent production, although not perfect. There are some silly errors that could have been prevented with more attention to detail, like visible microphones. It is also evident the quality of technology we take for granted today was not available in the early 1970's. Thus, the DVDs are not very good. In fact, I would recommend that you purchase the VHS edition, if you have a DVD/VHS player. The DVD set is much more expensive and the options one usually expects with DVD, like the scene index, are not offered.

2512907,5,B000EBD9VW,"I now have five DVDs in my collection.  This is because I see a movie once, and that's that--upward and onward.  I'd rather spend my money on books. The first three I bought are music DVDs.  This is only the second dramatic DVD I've ever bought.

  Why?  Keith Michell's performance as Henry VIII is simply the best I've ever seen, or probably will see, period.  Even the almighty Olivier or Anthony Hopkins couldn't kick out a performance of this stature.  I was only a kid (single-digit age) when I first saw this series, and it stayed with me ever since.  The production can be almost laughably flawed at times--during the first play, ""Catherine of Aragon,"" for example, you can easily see the microphones sticking up during the court scene, and in ""Jane Seymour,"" you can see it's a doll instead of a real baby, but the acting overrides what's not so good.  The supporting actors also give admirable performances, with the actress portraying each queen doing a fine job.  Anne Stallybrass as Jane Seymour and Rosalie Crutchley as Catherine Parr are particular standouts.  Basil Dignam as Bishop Gardiner, Wolfe Morris as Thomas Cromwell, and John Ronane as Thomas Seymour are also wonderful.  But Keith Michell is the man.  Over all six plays, running a total of nine hours, his performance is flawless.  Young, handsome, and idealistic to old, fat, and full of self-pity and ego, he gets it right from facial expressions to dialogue delivery. And he can dance and sing so well, I'm getting ready to order a performance or two of him in some Gilbert and Sullivan productions.
  Now, to be warned, I only bought the DVD instead of the videotapes simply because I knew I'd be watching them a lot, and didn't want to wear out a tape.  They list ""scene selection"" on the box, but the scenes are actually the choices between plays on each DVD.  That's it.  No extras, no nothing, so only buy the DVD if you are either going to watch them a lot, or want a DVD because it's easier to store.  I spent a lot of time when I first got the DVDs trying to find the scenes for selection, when it finally dawned on me that I could choose a play, and that's it.  Oh, well.
  After seeing this series for the first time, I became totally obsessed with finding out more about the era, and have since read dozens of books about Henry and his wives and his children.  Although each wife's story is condensed to 90 minutes, all six playwrights do a fine job of elaborating the basics.  Less dramatic license than I would have thought has been taken in many cases.  Glenda Jackson is also marvelous in her six-play series, ""Elizabeth R,"" which I recommend.

2512916,5,B000EBD9VW,""" The Six Wives of Herny VIII"" is a compelling historical drama in which Keith Mitchell, in the title role, recreates the King's life from his athletic youth to his agonizing death, all the while carrying the viewer on an exciting journey of the political and religious intrigues of the day.
 Accompanying us on this journey are six actresses and sundry supporting cast members who are all worth their mettle. Annette Crosbie plays Henry's first wife, Catalina D' Aragon, the youngest daughter of Spain's King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who becomes a competent regent in her husband's abscence and a devoted wife and mother despite Henry's infidelities. After 20 years of marriage, she is cruelly betrayed by an obscure verse in the Book of Leviticus because of her previous, but allegedly unconsumated marriage to her husband's late brother, Arthur. Her decline in status is tragically reenacted, redeemed by the way she is eulogized by and official at her death.
 Dorothy Tutin's Anne Boleyn is a boisterous gossip when she first appears on the scene. Her rise in status begins during the first episode, largely because of her role as Catherine of Aragon's most prominent Lady-in-Waiting. Despite her arrogance, and Henry's desire for her, she fails to give Henry a living son, as did Henry's first wife. Her tale moves in a glittering gallop, and she gives Henry the child who will become the greatest of his successors, Elizabeth. But her tale ends with her discreditation, largely with the help of the unscrupulous, Thomas Cromwell, her arrest at a tournament, her imprisonment, trial, during which she displays extreme gallantry despite the false accusations of adultery and incest leveled against her and her brother, George, and finally, with her execution. My heart went out to Mark Smeaton in this production because as I watched this innocent court musician lay his head on the block, what made an impression was the way his eyes were bruised and blackened by the torture imposed on him by Cromwell.
 Anne's replacement is Jane Seymour, whose gentleness and piety are marvelously emphasized by Anne Stallybrass. This Lady-in-Waiting to Henry's first two Queens begins to feel guilt about replacing a woman she believed to have been wrongfully executed as the King's wife. When her episode begins, we see the dying Queen attending her infant son's baptizim, and the principals of the court over which she presided in attendance, including Alison Frazer's sweetly portrayed Mary, the prodigal daughter to whom Jane restores to her husband's good graces after years of exile in the wake of the King's divorce from her mother, Catherine.
 While the career of Thomas Cromwell,(played by an appropriately conniving Wolfe Morris, whose resmblance to the real Cromwell is remarkable) may have advanced because of one Anne (Boleyn), another Queen Anne would prove to be his downfall. Seeking to ease his heartbreak over the loss of a wife he truly loved, as well as to strengthen political ties with a Protestant nation, Henry agrees to marry Anna Von Cleves, played by an enchanting and ebullient, Elvi Hale. But he soon realizes that Holbein's portrait of her was more flattering than factual, and the unsophisticated young bride is soon put aside.-The second Foreign-born Princess to be divorced by Henry VIII. In his anger, Henry turns on the very man who helped increase his power over the years, and the end of Henry's fourth marriage finds the unscrupulous lawyer, Cromwell imprisoned and sending the King letters in which he pleads for mercy, something that Anne Boleyn, over whose execution he presided, didn't do even though she had been married to him.
 Angela Pleasance is the naive young girl who was Anne Boleyn's cousin and Henry VIII' s fith wife. For a modern viewer, her life invites comparisons to the life of Princess Diana.--A promiscuous blue-eyed blonde(although Catherine was promiscuous before her marriage, and Diana wasn't)railroaded into an unhappy Royal marriage at an early age, who finds comfort in the arms of other men, which eventually cost her her life, and when she went down, she took two guys out with her. In Catherine's case, the two guys were Thomas Culpepper and Francis Dereham. Like her cousin before her, Catherine Howard was executed for adultery, but unlike Anne, the charges against her were not trumped up. Lady Mary Rochester, who had covered for her during her extramarital flings, is condemned with her.
 Last but not least, is the ""survivor"", Catherine Parr, who was twice wed and twice widowed before marrying the King. While she is a very fine actress, Rosilie Crutchley bears little resemblance to the real Catherine Parr, a redhead like himself, and like his first wife. Her own desire to marry Jane Seymour's brother, the Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour must be put on hold because of the King's desire to marry her. She tends to the ailing King in his last years, and befriends each of his three children, but barely saves herself from a charge of heresy. After Henry's death, she vows to marry Thomas Seymour, but, like his sister, Jane, her own life would terminate in childbirth.
 And so, this odyssey involving three Catherines, two Annes, and one Jane comes to an end. While it occassionally goes out of sequence, it is a meticulously created series, with solemly portrayed events in British history.",1005177600,,5365,5.041713641488163
2512937,5,B000EBD9VW,"Unlike the recent ""Elizabeth"" starring the superlative Cate Blanchette, this series (and the later Elizabeth R) is accurate as well as entertaining. Keith Michel is unrivalled as Henry, portraying the king with both his horrible and sympathetic qualities.. the wives are all three dimensional characters that can be related to... Having read numerous Tudor biographies and historical fiction, this series continues to excel. A must for newbies and hard-core Tudorites...",1004832000,,470,5.728571428571429
2512938,4,B000EBD9VW,"I take one star away because 1) when I bought this (at a local borders, sorry Amazon!), it had a duplicate of the second disc of 3 and no first disc.  The Six Wives of Henry VIII without Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn leaves something to be desired. On a brighter note, BFS sent me the missing disc, no questions asked. Very professional, courteous, speedy customer service. Amazon is great too, I just didn't know they had this. I'd never seen it anywhere on DVD.
I did get Elizabeth R from Amazon. It's wonderful. The two together are a treat, and some of the same actors make an appearance in both series.. I'd also highly recommend ""Anne of 1000 days"", ""Mary, Queen of Scotts"", Beckett, The Lion in Winter, and Lady Jane.  Unfortunately only ""Lion"" is available on DVD! Terrible!
The new ""Elizabeth"" got the story mostly wrong, but I liked it because of Cate Blanchett and the lush visuals. Still  the Honorable Ms Glenda Jackson rules! The interview with her was wonderful and shows her brilliance.
As mentioned elsewhere these would've been nice.

2512939,5,B000EBD9VW,"This is a series of six individual plays which focuses upon each of the six wives of King Henry VIII of England. Written by six different playwrights, they are uniformly excellent. While the production values are not high, that is because these plays were part of a televised series for which there were budgetary constraints. Although the makeup is noticable, the sets are uninspired, and the lighting is harsh, the costumes, however, are gorgeous. More important, the acting is superb.
King Henry VIII is played to perfection by Keith Mitchell. He has set the standard by which all others in the part will be judged, and he is the linchpin around whom the entire series revolves. He plays the young, athletic, erudite, golden king in the first tape, and the viewer watches him age and deteriorate throughout the entire series, until he finally becomes the sore riddled, morbidly obese, self absorbed, tyrannical hulk of his later years.
Each one of the six wives has her own unique story. The plays tell that story, each a first rate drama unto itself that segues into the next one seamlessly. All the queens are portrayed by very talented thespians, and the supporting cast is superlative. All in all, this series provides a fully absorbing historical drama that should not be missed. It is through the story of each of the wives that one is able to see England transform itself from a catholic country to a protestant one. It also provides a birdseye view of the political intrigues which fueled such a transformation.",999734400,,1522,4.857692307692307

  RELASE a Special edition..
  I love the seris, I remeber seeing theam on as a kid...
  They are very informitive and is the TRUTH about Henry VIII
 No wonder it is VBERY LONG!!! each episode (6) is 90 min
  Cathern of Aragon- Very good,,it makes my historical mind run wild, showing you what happend all the way back from Prince Arthurs' death..

 Anne Borlen (probly mispelt)-Very good even people who don't have any intrest in this area of history still like it,, But more of dull studio set,,, If you look carefully on several secens e.d. The area wear court was held if you look at a moveing scene you can just barly (but tell) its the set used for the room wear Anne gave birth to Princess Elizabeth (side note: I did this by turning up the color on my TV very high, this may not work on several TV's)
 Jane Seyamour- I haven't had the real time to sit down and watch the whole thing but Ive seen the importnat scens you will get confused at the very begining witch is Jane remeiseing before she dies at the beginning,, but has the birth of their son Edaward.
 Anne of Clevs- The boringest of theam all!!!! Alough this is  a no action seris,,, This isn't the most enteraning and most of the movie takes place at Whispheir (mostlikely misspelt but was wear Henry's children lived in their childhood).
 Cathern Howard- Very very good,, Great Acting, once again even people who aren't intrested like this to, Probly the best instead of Cathern of Aragon
Cathern Parr- Mostly the death of Henry VIII and the wise and noble Cathern plays a stunning role to.
  All in ALL its something for anyone who is intrested in British history, very infornitly now only if they made more on other monarchhs like Charles I..",998611200,,1733,4.485623003194888

2512944,5,B000EBD9VW,"I first watched THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII 30 years ago when it was first broadcast on American television.  Television was a new phenomena then--most homes having acquired a tv set within the previous 10 years.  Televised drama was excellent during the early 1970s--it was not uncommon to see a full-length Broadway Stage Play via a variety of wonderful ""playhouses"" sponsored by the major networks.  These days, one is only likely to see this quality of entertainment on PBS. WIVES is the typical Masterpiece Theater series PBS does so well.
WIVES is extremely well acted. Major talents of the British stage participated in these dramas. Of the actors playing major roles, probably only Annette Crosbie (Catherine of Aragon-Wife #1) will be recognized by contemporary audiences. I kept thinking as I watched her she could have passed for Sissy Spacek's sister when she was younger.  Fans of British comedy will recognize Crosbie as the long-suffering wife from ""One Foot in the Grave"" while fans of 'Mystery' and P.D. James will recogize her as the female sleuth and partner of Cordelia Grey in the series ""Unsuitable Job for a Woman.""
Many other actors who made minor appearances in this series will be recognized by PBS/BBC fans. Marion Mathie (Mrs. Rumpole or ""She who must be obeyed"") plays the Duke of Norfolk's wife. The older saleswoman with the multihued hair and ""pussy"" from ""Are you being served"" plays Anna von Cleves (wife #4) German attendent. There are many other familiar faces including the actor who plays Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, and it's fun to see who you can identify.
The plays themselves--there are six of them, each written by a different playwright--are well dramatized and relatively accurate. Having read Alison Weir's book on the same subject (the six wives), I know Anne Boylyn (wife #2) was badly treated, and I am not sure Jane Seymour (wife #3) was quite as innocent as this BBC play made her. She may have been haunted by the ghost of Anne--or not. The wives are played with sympathy.
No matter what your religious background, you will probably find yourself sympathizing with the Catholics--until Catherine Howard and her relatives appear (wife #5). I think an understanding of the background of of the religious wars enhances the viewing of these plays, but it is not necessary, and in my own case was the beginning of a life long interest in the subject.
I see another reviewer says his DVD transfer was less than satisfactory. Perhaps it's the original films that are at fault--not the transfer. I actually thought the DVD versions were excellent. TV used regular stages to dramatize plays in the ""olden"" days and interior and exterior shots (those taken outside) were not ""edited"" for background noises in the same way they are today. Seeing these plays is like watching a live play on your local cable tv. My DVD versions of WIVES look as good as they did when I first saw them 30 years ago.
If you're interested in well-acted and well written drama, and/or the history of the period, you will get your money's worth. The package seems pricey, but in my neck-of-the-woods, you can't buy theater tickets for excellent dramas with a professional cast at $10 a pop.",981504000,,3207,4.889705882352941
2512945,4,B000EBD9VW,"Romance, intrigue, murder and just a bit of humor make ""The 6 wives of Henry XIII"" a classic that you'll enjoy for MANY years to come. . . IF you're a fan of Brittish T.V.  or a history buff, that is!
It's difficult to describe the pomp and circumstance of such a grand series to anyone that's not ""lived"" it for themselves.  Brit T.V. has held America firmly in it's grasp since the first showing of Masterpiece Theater and ""The Pallisers"" about 320 years ago. . . Okay, it wasn't QUITE that long ago, but it seems like it sometimes.  If the series was available to you the first time around, watching it again on DVD will leave you wondering how you got on without it in your collection for so long.
I feel compelled to agree with a previous reviewer that said less about the series and more about it's transfer to DVD.  Though I don't feel the port was so bad as to call it on par with VHS, I DO feel that it has dropped to say, a poor BETA copy.  Still, with as much as you will gain from simply having the series in your collection, the minor picture imperfections and rare audio distortion are a small price to pay.

2512946,3,B000EBD9VW,"I won't comment on the landmark TV production -- it remains as fresh and engrossing as when I first saw it 30 years ago. The big disappointment here is that BFS Video has chosen to squeeze the series onto 3 single sided DVDs -- over 2 1/2 hours of video per DVD. The result, sadly, is that the picture quality is compromised by compression artifacts that reduce it to VHS quality. Compared to (say) ""I, Claudius"", of similar vintage but presented on 2-sided discs, this transfer is really below par. If you don't have this series, get it, as you'll enjoy it regardless of the quality issues. If you have it on VHS, stick with this, as the DVD is not worth it.",978048000,,659,4.365853658536586

John Woodnutt is superb as Henry.  Each  of the actresses playing his wives gives unique performances which  accentuates the differences in the women.
I found the entire piece  riviting, but I am draw by most anything Tudor.  In all honesty, there are  some slow spots in the production.  This is especially sad given the short  time they spend on each wife.
The series lacks much of the historical  background and political nature of each marriage.  However, I believe time  limits, it is impossible to portray the full picture.  Antonia Fraser and  Alison Weir both have excellent books on the subject.

Recently after a hiatus of 43 years I purchased it via Amazon to view it again and am mesmerized again. What a remarkable production, and especially the astonishing acting of Keith Mitchell who began in British theater.

To plausibly play a role which spans a time from a handsome idealist youth to a 55 year old fat and limp tyrant is no small feat. Even his voice convincingly changes in the course of this time period. Mitchell is simply superb, and the history of this tragic unfolding in England very accurate, the supporting cast wonderful.

Riveting is to say the least as you expect this to be a documentary. Upon viewing you find that it is anything but. As with all BBC productions there is no equivalent. A few liberties were taken with history but you just do not care because you are too busy kibitzing.

The Six Wives of Henry VIII can not be told in less than six programs. Each program or play has an appropriate title that explains the next queen. If the quality of the writing varies that is because they have different writers and it shows. When I first say that the episode ""Catherine of Aragon"" was written by Rosemary Ann Sission I knew we had a winner as she was also the screen writer for ""Strong Poison"" in the Lord Peter Wimsey (1987) (TV) series. So you can image how amazed I was to find that the episode ""Anne Boleyn"" was written even stronger.

The unifying element is Keith Michell who plays a spoiled brat oops I mean Henry VIII. He starts out clean shaven in his pageboy hairstyle and ends up as scruffy as his personality by the last play. It helps to have some background information of the time and place.
