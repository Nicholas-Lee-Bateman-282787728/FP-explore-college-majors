My initial impression during the preview was that it was going to be a piece of cake; this changed once I started to do the exercises.  It will get your heart rate up and the music is simply refreshing.  I think the best part of the routine and how it's presented is that the diverse fitness level of the individuals participating in the workout dvd.  Being winter, I'm looking forward to spring so that my family and I can head down to the park and work through the exercises outdoors in lieu of exercising in the basement.  For the price, I'd say give it a go!",1425081600,2,620,4.264957264957265
8602773,5,B00E8ZWGXM,"I have never been a huge fitness enthusiast, but I've done my fair share of at-home workout dvds. The majority of the ones I've done take place inside a studio disguised as some kind of neon warehouse, along with 4 perfectly fit people, 1 slightly out of shape person but could still beat you in a race around the block any day, and a fitness instructor that smiles far too much for my tastes.

The first thing I noticed about this DVD was that it took place OUTDOORS. Let me repeat this... OUTDOORS... in the most pristine, sprawling, lush stretch of lawn I've seen in ages and it's perfectly sunny. This atmosphere immediately made me feel better about this workout. I would rather look at people working out outside in the sun instead of in a weirdly lit warehouse. Secondly... Bon Iver. I don't know about you, but the idea of a bunch of guys who are not all perfectly fit, and probably spend more time indoors writing music or at the local bar with friends really appealed to me. I felt like I could relate to these people. Also, there's Jeff's brother, Tyler. As soon as I saw Tyler I felt happy because he represented where I could be if I kept up with this workout, but not in an obnoxious way. Then there's Jeff. He's super motivating and positive the entire time. He's nowhere close to being as annoying as I've found other fitness instructors. He just eases you into enjoying moving your body and ultimately looking forward to it. Finally, there's the music.  I honestly can't tell you how many times I've wished for a DVD like this one with music I would actually listen to and is totally my taste. It really is the total package for me.

Now I'm not going to pretend the workout is easy and chill the entire time because WOO.. it's not. There were times when I mentally cursed Jeff out for making me do mountain climbers. But you know what, I went at my own pace and fitness level, jogging in place when there were moves that I could not keep up with, and in time, it got easier.

Since I've had this DVD, I've recommended it to all my friends. ALL OF THEM. It's literally the only fitness DVD I own that doesn't have dust on it, and that says a lot. It's a total steal at this price and you would be nuts if you don't buy it.",1376784000,2,2239,4.3238095238095235
8602774,5,B00E8ZWGXM,"I have a sit down job where I'm in front of a computer 9-10 hrs per day. I never was a fan of working out but having a sit down job can pack the pounds on a person. I use to work out with Tae Bo in the past but as I'm getting older some of the moves in Tae Bo have become difficult for me to do. A friend suggested I give Jeff Rogers a try that his workout is low impact and more fun than the rigorous moves used in Tae Bo. I thought, why not give it a try. I'm wanting to get back to working out, need to shed some pounds, can't afford nor have the desire to join a gym so what have I got to lose. I'm thrilled I gave it a try. I've had this video for 2 weeks now and I love it! I do move slower than the men in the video but that's ok, I'm sure in time I'll pick up the pace and be able to move as fast as they do.

This workout is perfect for everyone. There's no need for fancy equipment, you don't have to use weights but you can if you want to. I jog in place since I can't do the speed ladder runs and I have horrible knees so I adjust some of the moves that work best for me which is what I love about this video. You're using your own body weight and can personalize it to your body. You can truly do this workout anywhere and anytime. No more excuses for not working out.  You will sweat, you will ache afterward but that's great. I feel more energized now than I have in a long while.",1376784000,3,1395,3.7094594594594597
8602775,5,B00E8ZWGXM,"I heard of this DVD as a fan of Bon Iver and Justin Vernon, and was immediately skeptical.  I don't think of many touring bands as fitness enthusiasts, but after watching the trailer ([...] and learning about how this DVD came to be, I was interested.  I'll admit that at first I wasn't sold on actually using it to work out, but then I watched it once, just sitting at my computer - I enjoyed the music (S. Carey, We Are the Willows, Gayngs, The Rosebuds, Megafaun, etc) and honestly, it seemed like I could do all of the exercises.  This was a big deal for me - as a child/young adult I was an athlete. I was on the volleyball and basketball teams in high school, I played soccer and softball recreationally, and had been on the a swim team for years, but after being married for 10 years and having 3 children, my weight, and more importantly to me, my athleticism and flexibility, were not what I wanted.

That being said, these moves are deceptively easy - you will sweat, and you will breathe hard.  I move slower than the men on the DVD, therefore doing less reps, and I'm okay with that.  I run in place instead of speed ladder runs.  My knees aren't great, so I  adjust some of the moves - but that's the GREAT thing about this DVD.  You do what you can do, and you feel better, everyday.  You don't need a weights to do this, but you can use them if you want.  You don't need a big yard to run in, but you could.  This workout is essentially you and your body, so you get to personalize it to your body, AND have the ability to do it anywhere, anytime.  I *never* loved working out, but after owning this DVD for months, I still look forward to working out with Jeff, his brother Tyler, and ""the original three"" from Bon Iver.

I am stronger, more flexible, have significantly less back pain, and am able to walk farther than I was able to before I started doing these exercises, which is so much more valuable to me than $15 cost for the DVD.",1376611200,,1953,4.22911051212938
