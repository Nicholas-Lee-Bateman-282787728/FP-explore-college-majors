7862579,3,6304109350,"The original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shootfighter/dp/B00005UWOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shootfighter</a>&nbsp;is considered a classic by several folks who've seen it; some even refer to it as one of the best martial arts movies ever made. I don't share that opinion, and actually consider its sequel here to be the better film. Marginally better, that is, because it's no masterpiece either. However, it's still a decent showcase for a boatload of fighters, a platform for 14 fight scenes, and the last film of Bolo Yeung's to have received a wide release. For that, it definitely deserves general consideration.

The story: Returning martial artists Nick (Michael Bernardo), Ruben (William Zabka), and their master Shingo (Yeung) are recruited by a police sergeant to infiltrate and expose a Floridian shootfighting ring run by a deadly promoter (Joe Son,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers-International-Man-of-Mystery/dp/6304696221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery</a>).

Other notable martial stars include Cesar Carneiro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quest/dp/0783226748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quest</a>), Brett Clark (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Delta-Force-Commando/dp/B000KWZ7FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Delta Force Commando</a>), and Tony de Leon (who's stunt-doubled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Travolta/dp/6305232733/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Travolta</a>), along with a bunch of lesser-known performers. They're choreographed by John Salvitti - Donnie Yen's personal fight choreographer, best known for his contributions to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>. The cumulative result of all this talent? - an okay karate show. I like these fights a little more than the original movie's, despite the reduced amount of weapons and bloodletting. The choreography is fine and all the performers do well enough, but the editing can be a pain. Note to the filmmakers: enough with the cutaway shots! I don't need to see that the audience is cheering - I can *hear* them cheering. Why not just keep the camera on the fight, for sanity's sake?

One fight which is largely spared this and ends up being the best exchange of the movie is the climatic showdown between Bolo and Joe Son. Though Bolo doesn't give a very enthusiastic dramatic performance, his physical performance is just about the best I've seen in his U.S. filmography. His opponent helps: I don't want to sound macabre, but while Joe Son is an intimidating guy to begin with, he becomes all the more so after you look up his legitimate criminal record. Also, I'm disappointed that Will Zabka and Mike Bernardo aren't given the opportunity to make much of an impact, but we do get the opportunity to see the former in a rare sex scene...which, somewhat embarrassingly, the credits tell us he was doubled for.

The production values are good, though the film doesn't attempt to do anything out of the ordinary. The direction by B-movie schlockmeister Paul Ziller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sea-Beast/dp/B001UDS4D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sea Beast</a>) is about as good as it gets for him, and altogether, the film fits the staple of low-budget martial arts action that I love. You can definitely do worse than this one, just don't set your expectations too high.",1360454400,2,3671,6.738396624472574
7862580,3,6304109350,"The first Shootfighter was one of the best original American made martial art movies ever in my opinion.  Unfortunately, part 2 got lazy.  This time the action takes place in Miami.  The story is nothing more than a sting operation to discover who is behind the illegal Shootfighting ring, which ends up going bad.  William Zakba, Michael Bernardo and Bolo Yeung are the only 3 to return from the first film.  Sorry to say, but their roles in this film were pretty bland.  As for the other characters in the film, it pretty much goes the same way.  The villain and leader of the Shootfighter ring plays Shingo's (Bolo Yeung) brother in this film, but his character too is unimpressive and not convincing.

The real let down is the action.  There are less fights, poorer choreography, less weapons, barely any blood and realism, and just plain unimpressive fighters compared to the first Shootfighter.  Again, Bolo does have one final fight in the movie, which is about the only good fight in the film (especially when the villain rips some barbed wire off the cage and begins whipping it at Shingo).

Compared to most martial art films, Shootfighter 2 is not bad.  Shootfighter 1 just set such high standards that its hard to appreciate the 2nd as much.",1155859200,,1253,4.723502304147465

7862582,1,6304109350,"With the variety of entertainment available on today's market, it is rare to find an action film that can actually hold a is even rarer to find one that does so simply due to the poor quality of the film. This movie is so utterly repulsive that one can't help but stare on, fascinated by the sheer lack of imagination, befuddled by the few snippets of dialogue that string together into a ""plot"" (and I use the term VERY loosley), and generally curious to see just how much worse the movie can get. This movie could be used as a form of capital punishment (as it seems repeated viewing could cause brain atrophy), except that such a punishment would most assuredly fall into the category of ""Cruel and Uusual"". Actually spending money on movies such as ""Shootfighter 2"" only encourages studios to produce more of its ilk. In short, not only would I recommend never watching this movie, but I would also recommend that any existing copies be destroyed.",1025395200,,951,4.633136094674557
7862583,4,6304109350,"I saw this film because I'm a fan of Bolo Yeung. It compares well with his other films, especially those from Hong Kong in the 70's which often have poor film quality. The plot was nothing spectacular but it was original.  The action scenes were very good. Yeung was mesmerizing in that respect, as  usual. Overall I enjoyed the film, and recommend it.",912297600,,352,4.571428571428571
