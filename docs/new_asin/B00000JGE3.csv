1232240,4,B00000JGE3,"This three hours movie is full of entertainment. It's very touching and you can't stop the movie for just even a second. You can see several years of a woman who tries to be a female director in a time where woman liked  more to be seen at home cooking for a man. But she managed everything, but  has to fight in private against all the family troubles that appear. The  most touching thing is when her gay son was denied by his father and she  has to deal with it. The ending is very sad but watch for yourself and  enjoy ""Family Album"" !",947980800,9,539,4.095238095238095

The movie arrived very quickly, and in the condition stated by the seller. I have watched this movie, several times now, and it plays wonderfully. The cover, also in excellent condition, has kept the movie protected, throughout the years. The movie itself is a very touching story from start to finish. Thanks to all involved. It is very appreciated.",1344729600,,473,4.780487804878049

7912130,5,B00000JGE3,"...for anyone who grew up during the sixties and seventies this is a poignant look back that you won't want to miss.  Don't look for flashes of pop idols, teenage fads, or media darlings... rather than the then world under the spotlight, ""Family Album"" is about you and me and all the other everyday people who were playing out the search for the typical ""American Dream"" during the years when it finally began to grow up. And while your mom may not have been a movie star or your dad a business tycoon you'll see them in Faye and Ward Thayer, and you'll see yourself as well... struggling to be one with yourself and one with your family...
Don't miss out on Danielle Steele's ""Family Album""... it's a great flick! Great performances were delivered by Jackyln Smith, Michael Ontkean and then newcomer Joe Flanigan.",1061683200,4,815,4.659722222222222
7912131,5,B00000JGE3,"This movie although alot different than the book is very good. It documents the heartache, losses, and triumphs of one remarkable woman... Fay Price Thayer. In this movie she will learn many lessons including the  power to forgive a cheating husband, helping a pregnant daughter make  decisions, love her gay son, and rise to the top as an oscar winning  director. This movie is so realistic and makes you feel as if you are  watching a real family live there lives. There are times when you have to  assure yourself that this is just a movie. Don't pass up the chance to see  and feel the emotions of one remarkable family and share the moments that  were remembered in there Family Album.",948240000,13,690,4.60655737704918
