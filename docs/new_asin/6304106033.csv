783372,2,6304106033,"RESTORATION is an excellent example of what happens when artists suppress what gives them and us pleasure in order to make us better human beings.
As long as it stays at the court of Charles II (Sam Neill, one of the most wasted actors of the past twenty years, here at his sly best), RESTORATION is a luscious romp, as rich and delectable as a fully ripe peach. You can practically hear the filmmakers giggling in pleasure at the sumptuous period spread they've given us. Designed and photographed superbly, these sequences amply suggest why England welcomed the libertine Charles back to the throne after Cromwell's grimly Puritanical interregnum. Even the scenes in the slums of London have an atavistically sensuous appeal, as if the very dirt, blood and garbage were alive with erotic potential.
Alas, 17th Century England may have had enough of the Puritans, but filmmakers are never allowed to suggest that sensual pleasure may be enough on its own. It always has to be justified with a ""deeper"" message. Sure enough, after the fun comes the good doctor's ""salvation"" in a solemn, sanctimonious parable of redemption through suffering. (With Robert Downey in the part, it's hard not to view the doctor's excesses in light of the actor's own difficulties with drugs and alcohol, but do we really have to go to his AA meetings with him?) You can't say the film is exactly hypocritical for indulging us one minute, then preaching the next. There's not enough conviction in these dim scenes to suggest the filmmakers really care about virtue. It's obvious they're longing to sneak back to court.
The problem is, convictionless or not, the scenes are still heavy-going, humorless slogs through a set of moral clichs calculated to prove, once again, that those who enjoy themselves too much are bound to pay for it one way or another and can only achieve their true humanity by finding love for another. Yawn. Thank goodness the King conveniently turns up at the end to make the doctor's life fun again. It's wonderful how filmmakers always manage to let us have our cake and eat it too. So the real lesson you are likely to take away from RESTORATION is that if you're going to have fun, make sure Daddy's around to bail you out when you get into trouble. That may be a more truthful observation about our contradictory attitudes toward pleasure than anybody realized.",970012800,10,2370,4.8399014778325125
783373,4,6304106033,"Admirable costume drama lavishly made and brilliantly set in 17th century England before during and after the Great Plague and the great fire of London. Although it dosent quite pull it of some how. This is the story of a  profligate young surgeon played by the forever rehabillitating Robert  Downey jr in one of his better roles,who eventually finds his true calling  as a healer of the sick. The cameos by Hugh Grant,Ian McKellen,Polly Walker  and supporting cast Meg Ryan and Sam Neill manage to lift this film above  the ordinary but the second half seems to ramble along in a disorganised  manner some how losing the interest of its audience until the denouement at  the end. Enough said. I have always been fascinated by the character of King  Charles II.One of Englands more wayward monarchs played here by new zealand  actor Sam Neill. Not for nothing was he known as the merry monarch. His  reputation with woman was such from the high born to the common peasant  girl that he left behind him a whole raft of illegitimate children who all  married into the english nobility. The lady Diana Spencers family is  descended from one of them. The irony is that despite all these proginey he  failed to sire one legitimate heir from his long suffering but barren wife  the portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza. His sense of humour extended  to all. When the founder of Pennsylvania William Penn approached Charles to  petition him for land in the new World he refused to take his hat of  whereby the king removed his own exclaiming to the surprised quaker that  'where I am mr Penn only one head may remain covered'.Despite the faux pas  Charles generously granted the request. In his extensive works on the  history of The English-speaking Peoples Winston Churchill vilifies and  decries the reputation of this most un-serious king. I believe the man was  more complicated than that. Oh well. Sam Neill gives an authentic portrayal  here of king Charles,despite his flawed character. The film itself may not  interest you but the history sure will.",949708800,5,2058,4.844827586206897
783374,5,6304106033,"One night flipping through channels, I came upon Restoration. I watched it and became engrossed. When it came on again, I made sure I was watching it. At first, I fell in love with the costumes, scenery, and music, but then I  started to notice this adorable actor. He was superb. Through the entire  movie, it felt like I was a part of the movie because his acting pulled me  in.",946944000,,380,4.323943661971831
783375,5,6304106033,"I LOVED this film.  I wasn't sure at first if it would be as wonderful as I had heard, but it was!  Meg Ryan gives an exquisite and moving performance, one that before seeing this film, I didn't think she was  capable of accomplishing.  Visually this film is magnificent and  sumptutous. If you love Robert Downey, Jr., as an actor, you will love this  film!",939513600,3,358,4.430769230769231
783376,5,6304106033,"Let me preface my review by saying that I've always thought Robert Downey, Jr. to be one of the best actors...  This film just confirmed that for me; I managed to catch it on the Independent Film Channel, and I couldn't get  out of my chair at all.  Fabulous sets, excellent performances, and a great  cast made this a truly memorable film.  I'm so intrigued by the story  itself that I've decided to buy the book while here writing my review!  I  found it hard to believe that the running time is 2 hours because the film  so involves you that time just slips away.  I highly recommend it for  Downey fans and for anybody who wants to see a film that will stay with  them way beyond the credits.  FABULOUS!",939254400,,707,4.305343511450381
783377,5,6304106033,"I knew the cast well before I began to watch this, but I had no real idea of what I was going to see.  I was impressed.  Sam Neill's performance of the King was tongue in cheek and glorious.  He was intimidating, funny, and  spiritual in every scene he was in.  Robert Downey Jr was phenomenal as  Robert Merivel, a sweet but debached physician...Physician heal thyself is  the order from the king and it takes much hardship and soul searching for  the good doctor to complete his own heart's truth, but when he does, nearly  everything is restored to him. He fears much and is talented and can only  begin to live when he has faced himself and gone on. I give this movie the  ultimate thumbs up and its not nearly enough.
The sets were lavish and  befitting the time and the costuming was revealing about the human attitude  of that time for fashion.  Every where you looked, the heart motif showed  itself, from a mole on the cheek, to a physician's silver case, to a wig's  shape, to the open medical book, to the living breathing man who bears a  hole in his chest that reveals his beating heart. Who among us would dare  to reach in and touch the organ?",928368000,,1158,4.356807511737089

783379,5,6304106033,"The title Restoration has more than one meaning here. It refers, of course, to the period in history, but also to one man's own quest, from arrogance and dissipation to love and responsibility. I saw this movie  because I like period pieces, but more than that, I found this movie  extremely moving and uplifting. Downey's performance is astounding. Yes, it  is slower in the second half, but to me it proved no detriment. See this  movie if you care about the human condition, and if you appreciate quality  movies.",911692800,2,516,4.752808988764045

783721,3,6304106033,Restoration was fine.  It was not Robert Downy Jr.'s best work.  I've enjoyed many of his films and shows.  I like historical films so I took a chance.,1381968000,,151,4.321428571428571
783722,5,6304106033,"There are few films that can be watched as repeatedly as 'Restoration.' Not only is it beautiful to watch, the imagery drawing you in, but the way the tone flows throughout the film is brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly and the way his character grows throughout the story is a joy to watch. My girlfriend & I make Restoration our go-to movie when we want to laugh out loud as well as get pulled into the sadder elements of the human condition.",1381363200,3,463,4.458823529411765
783723,5,6304106033,Restoration is a redemption movie. A restoration of the monarchy in England in the 1600's and a restoration of a man who spent his life screwing up and finally got it and made something of himself. Kind of like Robert Downey Jr. himself. I see it as his actual future in the making when he was being wild and reckless. If you love Robert Downey Jr. you will love this well done period piece. I love it for the what could be. It is one well made movie and I highly recommend it to anyone. There are many surprises here!,1380931200,4,518,4.19
783724,5,6304106033,"Loved this movie!  Gorgeously filmed, elegantly scripted, expertly cast, this story of redemption, while set during England's restoration, is timeless.  Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Dr. Robert Merivel, a gifted man ready to abandon his knowledge and skill at medicine in preference for a hedonistic lifestyle, seems to be a parable for Downey's own past lifestyle. His ability to transform Merivel from the court fool to a deeply caring and self sacrificing man is a satisfying and enjoyable journey as Downey's ability to provide both aspects equally, elevates the film to a jewel of an example of the power of love and the responsibility for all to use the gifts we were given.",1380672000,,683,5.035398230088496
783725,5,6304106033,A fine movie-one of Robert Downey Jrs best! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the the history of the 1600 era-or who isn't a Robert Downey Jr fan-or who IS!!,1379721600,2,165,4.1875
783804,4,6304106033,"It is easy how the scenery and costumes made this Oscar worthy but it might have been called Redemption as much as Restoration for the path of the prodigal physic played by Mr. Downey.  A rake moved by selfish interest, seduced by wealth and excess to the point he forgets his natural ability to cure, married to a concubine he may not touch, then dispossessed, saved by a crazy Meg Ryan's Irish love, and restored to prominence as a real physician after plague and fire in 17th Century London.  It is believable enough to be moving and is not at all dated since the imagery of the past was so well executed.  Outside of Tropic Thunder Downey is best when he plays himself (he is Iron Man) - this early version is true to Downey qua Downey.",1377820800,,740,4.386861313868613
783805,5,6304106033,"I love this movie, the acting & the time era that it is set in. It is one that I have watched more than once.",1377129600,,109,3.4
783806,4,6304106033,"The first half of this movie is serious eye candy, the depiction of the luxurious (and sleazy) court of Charles II in the 1600s.  The second half is the REAL England of that period, where primitive methods are used to treat the mentally and physically ill, and London is struck by the plague, then the Great Fire.  The main character, a playboy doctor named Merivel (Robert Downey) finds his redemption and his true purpose in life attending to plague victims and restoring to sanity a young abandoned wife (Meg Ryan), who bears him a child and gives him hope for a better future.  I'm not sure Downey was the ideal choice for the lead, and I'm certainly no fan of Meg Ryan (her Irish accent is ""variable,"" to say the least), but the supporting players are all in fine form, especially David Thewlis as Pearce, Merivel's best friend (and conscience) and Ian McDiarmid (yeah, the emperor from Star Wars) as the compassionate head of an insane asylum.  Sam Neill, always a fine actor, is perfect as the decadent king Charles II, a degenerate who nonetheless possesses a tad of compassion.  There are a few flaws - for example, during the Great Fire, Merivel lies unconscious on a boat in the Thames River and somehow the boat ends up in Suffolk - a geographical impossibility.  But, all things considered, this is a pleasure to watch, both visually (the first half) and emotionally (the second half).  Some of the scenes, such as Merivel playing an oboe while he invites the inmates of the asylum to dance and shake off their melancholy, are memorable.",1376092800,2,1550,4.697416974169742

Whatever Robert Downey was going through as he was starring in this gorgeous film, there is no doubt he had been born to be an extraordinarily gifted actor with enormous range. A young Hugh Grant worked his magic in a small part, as did Ian McKellan, Sam Neill, David Thewliss and Meg Ryan in their roles. Exuberant and sobering, keeps you on your toes.

The first part is quite funny and the second moves into deeper tones and Downey does all of perfectly.  He carries off the humor wonderfully and no one expresses pathos any better than he does.

Other than a showcase for Downey's talents there is a good story and splendid sets and costumes. The music is nice, too, especially if you like Pachobel's Canon.  I do.  Meg Ryan does a good job as do all the other actors, including a funny turn by Hugh Grant as a swishy portrait painter.

In being careless about his lusty life, it was only a matter of time before his glory was lost, but in that loss, he became the compassionate servant and used his healing ability appropriately.

784031,4,6304106033,"Restoration is a very well-made film about (gasp!) the restoration of the monarchy in England after the reign of terror of Cromwell.  While the focus of the film is not actually King Charles (and his ubiquitous spaniels), Sam Neill does well in the role of the king.  Robert Downey, Jr., shines as a libertine doctor who rises to importance in the court by curing the illness of one of the king's beloved spaniels.  The king uses the doctor as a way to hide his mistress, which leads to the doctor's downfall and sends him back to his penurious roots.  I have always liked Downey, even when the films he appears in are less than stellar, and his performance here is really pretty good.  The only actor I have any quibbles with is Meg Ryan, who is horribly miscast as a lunatic the doctor encounters and with whom he is entangled.  The ending of the film is also a bit unbelievable, but overall, it's a good watch for anyone who enjoys period dramas.  The costuming and cinematography are also well worth a mention.",1350950400,,1014,4.538461538461538

This is where we meet the brilliant Robert Merivel (Robert Downey, Jr.) who puts personal interests before his natural ability to heal.  Merivel is daring and hedonistic, although full of passion for the human condition.  He is desperate to experience the joy in life first though and cannot find that balance in the London College of Medicine.  He may be dedicated to medicine although just as dedicated to himself at the start of this beautiful period piece.  While this is the climate for the movie, ""Restoration"" is more about Dr. Robert Merivel. King Charles II, learns of his insightful methods and appoints him to be his court physician. He pleases the King and is knighted quickly only to learn that the reason why is to remove one of the King's mistresses, in wedlock, to his newly obtained estate away from the court and he cannot touch the woman.

Darkly shadowed reports of the Plague are nearing London and leaving the people terrified. Finding Merivel now penniless and actually practicing medicine in a small commune where he meets his ""mad"" beautiful Irish Katherine (Meg Ryan). He brings new techniques into the treatment of the patients. During this time Katherine and Merivel begin meeting every night in secret and as actions lead to consequences, Merivel and Katherine are asked to leave together residing back in London.  The Plague has broken out. Merivel is dealing with Katherine and also his restored passion for the care of others. Now, what of King Charles II? Will he need Merivel for another reason? As the story draws its end, we find that Merivel has been impassioned for the lives of others, through everything he has suffered and everything he has gained.",1323734400,20,1777,4.887043189368771

Adapting a long novel to the screen is never easy, and so while there are some clunky bits and howlers in terms of continuity in this film, it rises above the ordinary costume drama thanks to its humor and humanity.

Downey is a comic genius, with every gesture contributing to his 'lovable fool' Merivel, who becomes an heroic figure due to the role history thrusts upon him. All of the cast support him as he takes center stage in a humble way, the chemistry between him and Neill as the King, and with Thewlis as his best friend John is brilliant.

The Polly Walker sections were very good, the costumes amazing. The Meg Ryan sections were rather contrived, but again, Downey's performance of such sincerity carries it through.

The ending is total Hollywood, but perfect for the film as a whole, and its constant play upon light and dark. So while it is not faithful to the book, it is faithful to its own rendering of it.

The costumes, settings, wonderful locales like Forde Abbey, Brympton D'Evercy, (I read all the credits!) and Blenheim Palace, make this not a perfect movie, but certainly what period movies should be.

Ian McKellan as Will, his loyal servant, and Hugh Grant as the treacherous painter Finn, and the dozen or so Cavalier King Charles spaniels, make this a charming and moving film about one man's redemption and restoration.",1248307200,,1424,4.725806451612903
784123,4,6304106033,"I enjoyed this movie, though it took a while before the film came to have any meaning or direction.  At first this movie seems like it will be a raunchy, drunken, orgy film with the main character, Robert Merivel, gaining acceptance into the royal household of King Charles II of England.  A physician, he saves the king's dog then becomes a drunken boor at court.

Chalres uses Robert for a dupe then Robert is cast out of court when he defies the king's wish.  He ends up doctoring lunatics.  It is at this point where the film takes on life.  Eventually Robert's companion gives birth to a daughter then dies.  Robert takes the daughter to London where the plague is ravaging.  Then the fire of London happens.  In the end, Robert is restored to some of his former acceptance at the court of the king again.

This film is a decent portrayal of restroation England, though this should not be confused with the film's title.  Charles II is a supporting role, not the lead.  We see Robert Merivel's rise and fall and restoration.  Do not get history from films, the old saying goes.

RESTORATION is one of those magnificent films that is flawed by it's screenplay that was reduced from Rose Tremain's novel. The plot....(here we go!)... concerns one highly intelligent but flawed and immature physician of London in 1663,one Sir Robert Merivel,magnificently portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. Merivel is in practice with his good Quaker Friend John Pearce (David Thewlis) when Merivel becomes one of the many pawns in King Charles 11's (""The Merry Monarch"") ascension to the Throne in the Age of ""Restoration"".The shuttered theatres are again opened (the fact that the music chosen for this film is primarily from the Restoration Theatre composer, Henry Purcell shows again the high quality of authenticity in this film!))and there is an increase in the pursuance of knowledge and medical advancement in opposition to the archaic and superstitious practices of the former years. Merivel,though,does not heed the advice of his friend Pearce and does the King's bidding by accepting a place at The Royal Court. This is when Merivel is drawn into the King's web of Royal whim and Merivel becomes the most miserable he has ever been. Why? The King has ordered that Merivel marry the Royal Mistress,in order to appease and avoid scandal,but that Merivel is to NOT fall in love with The Lady Celia! Merivel does,though. He cannot help it. The King banishes Merivel,losing all only to now return to Pearce and resume medicine. There Merivel encounters madness and disease of all sorts and sets about to bring his medical knowledge to these patients. One is Catherine (Meg Ryan) whom Merivel acutely realizes has been damaged by past experiences and is not mad as suspected. They become intimate and she eventually bears his child, only to die in childbirth. Distraught,Merivel takes his young daughter and flees to London only to find that the Plague is consuming the city and that Celia is sick. Posing as Pearce,who has since died,Merivel is summoned to the Palace and diagnoses the sick Celia as needing love and understanding from the King (a marvelous Sam Neill).The London fire then strikes the City and Merivel tries to find his infant daughter. He is cast adrift out of the city,but in the end his daughter is returned, the King's favour is restored and Merivel has learned the lessons of compassion and true love. All is restored!!!.....WHEW!....AND I LEFT OUT A LOT!!!! Now,could you follow that??? That now is the one rub with this film;the book is all there and it is crammed into 2 hours! It doesn't work. Knowing Tremain's book helps immensely with filling in what either the director,script super or editor left out! Other than that,RESTORATION is a GRADE A ""super-flawed"" film that I love more every time I see it,but I will always have to hold it to 4 stars because of the screenplay! If there ever comes out a Director's Cut I will be the first in line at Amazon. Until then....

His medical ability brings him to the attention of the king, Charles II, who offers him a place at court.  Merivel proceeds to squander his medical gifts on wine, women, and general debauchery which, while very entertaining to watch, ultimately leads to his exile from the court and the king's good graces.  He takes refuge with his best friend who is a doctor in a Quaker asylum for the insane.  Thus begins Merivel's path, never smooth, to redemption.  Restoration is a beautiful movie visually but even more so in spirit. There is a kindness in its characterization, action and dialogue which is rare in film.

Telling a story set in England during this age, director Michael Hoffman gives us an unflinching view of the grit and grime of the seventeenth-century, even as he deliberately contrasts it with the French-influenced grandeurs of the Royal Court. Sam Neill steals the show in my opinion and nails dead-on the personality of the complex King Charles II, once a futureless exile during the Commonwealth, now an all-powerful monarch intent on solidifying his place in history. Also for all his reputed drug use, Robert Downey Jr's acting skills are as good here as they were in Chaplain. Downey plays physician Robert Merivel, a carousing womanizer whose incipient talents in medicine are smothered by his desires for fleshly pleasures, and we see him first rise under the patronage of King Charles (as he receives credit for saving the life of a royal mistress' pet dog)  and later witness his downfall from the easy hedonism of the Court. Merivel rues his banishment and finds a place amid the lowest of the low, eventually fathering a child with a half-mad Irishwoman played by Meg Ryan. When Merivel demonstrates selfless courage during a time of national crisis, he again comes to the notice of the pragmatic and shrewd king, and before film's end he, too, is ""restored"" in fortune and arises a new and far better man for the tortuous journey through which his life has taken him.",1171756800,4,1686,4.91578947368421

He plays a self indulgent physician whose introduction to the viewer comes as he whines about having to treat sick people and has sold his instruments into pawn and is begging his father for the money to get them back.  Downey does a fine job as the over indulgent young man who is made a fool by the King and must learn the lessons that his friend, a simple Quaker physician (played surprisingly well by David Thewlis, who himself is normally the nail in the coffin for any movie hoping to be remotely good)and a mad woman (Meg Ryan).  It is the performances of the actors and the over all beauty of the film that makes it stand out as exceptional.  Sam Neil was delightfully wicked as King Charles II, Meg Ryan was hauntingly memorable as the mad woman whose tragic life is healed by Downey's physician and who teaches him about love, and though it pains one to say it, by David Thewlis whose portrayal of Dr. John Pierce not only makes Downey's transformation into a compassionate human being believable but also is surprisingly good in and of itself.

784232,3,6304106033,"Visually magnificent, with plenty of opportunities for oppressive opulence in this delicious, but ultimately convoluted epic, *Restoration* is a lovely mess. Spanning the reign of Charles II, the great fire, the plague, ad nauseum, the ""restoration"" refers to, not only the period, but the human condition. But that conclusion is a difficult one to arrive at, and will only be understood by those viewers who actually sit through the movie. Shot in England and Wales, and winning Academy Awards for Art Direction and Costumes, the script involves a promising young doctor, Jack Merivel (Downey), whose gifts attract the attention of the King. Entering the revered court circle, Merivel has the delights of the world at his fingertips and ultimately succumbs to debauchery. But it is a story of restoration (as well as *the* Restoration) and redemption, with certain timeless aspects that have modern consequences, but the script begins to fray throughout the second half. With the exception of an unpleasant, jarring characterization of a mentally ill woman by Meg Foster (whose forte is definitely not period pieces), the leading and supporting roles are well cast. Downey has an appeal and charm (one that survived his recent tribulations), and gives Merivel humor, irony and dedication, in addition to the human foibles he falls victim to. Neill carries off the role of King Charles II with style and assurance, as he seeks to secure the permanent services of his mistress by marrying her off the Merivel, thus keeping her near. The King has selected Merivel for his inability to be placated with one woman - Merivel's desires keep him on a constant conquest for new and different lasciviousness - but the King's one condition is that Merivel not fall in love with his own wife. Needless to say, that is exactly what occurs, and thus begins the tumultuous fall from grace. And that's just the first part of this lengthy movie. The second half deals with Merivel's quest for redemption - not from the King, but from himself and God. It involves his daughter by the Meg Ryan character, and this is where the story changes from costume drama to social commentary. It is through Merivel's personal travails, as well as those inherent in the period: disease, pestilence and ignorance, that Merivel understands that the only reason he is on earth is to care for this child that is an extension of himself. His flight to find her and prove his worthiness in overcoming the obstacles set before him is a moment that would have been served at little earlier in the film. Despite the lush cinematography, there is an overdose factor involved that, once the outcome of the movie is evident, the viewer yearns for it to hurry along and be over. That said, it also leaves lingering memories of beauty and gratification.",1106438400,11,2809,4.953389830508475
784233,5,6304106033,"Director Michael Hoffman's 1994 film ""Restoration"" was based on Rose Tremain's novel about 17th century England in the time known as ""The Restoration"" during the reign of King Charles II. A gorgeous film, it explores the times and its light and dark elements while at the same time we journey through the eventful life of the physician Dr. Robert Merivel (played by Robert Downey Jr). Through the course of the film, he encounters two women- the mysterious, beautiful and aristocratic Lady Celia Clemence (Polly Walker) and the simple, Irish Puritan played by Meg Ryan who hardly takes up roles in historic films. Guest stars include Ian McKellen (Gandal from Lord of the Rings)as a member of the king's court and Hugh Grant as an annoying, self-deluded portrait artist.

 The title suggests not only the period in England's history but the spiritual ""restoration"" of Robert himself, who goes through enormous change throughout the film, from womanizing, sinful, care-free, naive, immature young doctor to enlightened, wise, mature, compassionate and religiously guided family man. Merivel is a doctor during the Plague- not the Bubonic Plague of Shakespeare's day but the later plague of the mid 1600's. Science is illuminating the otherwise dark, superstitious medieval world as a type of Renaissance emergences in all the fields. Charles II (played by Sam Neill) has restored England and freed the country from the conservative, repressed and bleak reign of the Puritans, opening the theatres again (which the Puritans had found sinful)and opening his mind to the wonders of science. In one scene, an elderly guinea pig has been cut to reveal his living heart which he tells Merivel he can touch for a shilling. The role of Charles II is performed effortlessy by Sam Neill who makes him appear like England's version of Frances' Louis XIV the ""Sun King"". He offers Lady Celia (who enters in a magnificent display) as Merivel's bride but in one condition: he must never fall in love or have sexual relations with her. However, the promise is broken when Merviel and Celia do break the rules. Lady Celia, one of many mistresses of the polyamorous English king, is jealous and tormented that she is not the only one who owns the king's heart. I thought her character was rather wooden in this respect and she could have at least shown more strength of character rather than pining away for that lusty king. In contrant, Meg Ryan is simple, unassuming, spiritually motivated and ultimately happier though she lives in sheer poverty and plague.

This is another little twist to the story. The poor seem to be better people than the rich. John Pearce, a Quaker, is the opposite of Charles II as he seems to be the power figure in a religious world of humanity and simplicity rather than luxury and pursuit of pleasure. This is a gorgeous film, with beautiful detail and attention to historic fact as well as a moving journey in the life of one man. Robert Downey Jr. himself incorporates the modern Merivel, as he has himself indulged in pleasures- and in life-afflicting drugs of which he has since recovered. Now, Downey is a better man, a changed man, much like Merivel in the end of the film. This is a great movie to look at, if only for its visual cinematography. There is subtle symbolism in the film, such as the tree in the Puritan settlement which seems to have mystic connections, the London Fire seems to be speaking of Hell Fire, the Universe ""Model"" with the King in the center seems to be saying that Charles II's reign was absolute. A great costume drama that is not easily forgotten.",1097798400,10,3597,4.864600326264274
784234,5,6304106033,"""Restoration"" won a pair of Oscars for Eugenio Zanetti's Art Direction-Set Deocration and James Acheson's Costume Design, and there is a sense in which the spectacular sets threaten to overwhelm the story, which is based on the novel by Rose Tremain.  This is a gorgeous film where the camera often takes time to focus on every detail as we are introduced to one spectacular set after another that presents the lavish court of King Charles II, who returned to the English throne following the restoration of the Stuart monarch.  As far as period costume dramas go this 1994 film is virtually in a class by itself, and how it was made for only $18 million is beyond belief.

The reason that many viewers may not cotton to this film is that it is one in which we are repeatedly misled as to what the film is above.  Even with the hint of the film's title, which is at face value the term used to describe the reign of Charles II, ""Restoration"" makes more sense retrospectively.  However, I liked the idea that my idea of what the film was about kept evolving.  After all the times I have sat through predictable films and been ahead of the characters and the plot, I can certainly enjoy trying to keep up with a story for once and being surprised by the twists and turns in the narrative.

The story is about Robert Merivel (Robert Downey Jr.), a young physician of great promise who is summoned to court to attend to a patient at the command of the King (Sam Neill).  Merivel succeeds, albeit more through luck than skill, and is appointed to a position in court.  Seduced by life in the palace Merivel accepts the position, which means turning his back on his studies and his best friend John Pearce (David Thewlis), a Quaker.  However, the King finds another use for Merivel and marries him to his most spirited mistress, Lady Cedlia (Polly Walker).  After the lavish wedding Merivel gets a knighthood and a huge country estate, but the one thing that is denied him is sex with his ""wife.""  Having been ordered not to fall in love with Celia, we believe we know what this film is going to be about.  However, in that regard we are both right and wrong.

Despite the glamour of Merivel's rise in the first part of this film, it is his fall that produces the true drama.  It is a long fall, hard fall, set against the backdrop of two cataclysmic events in the London of that time: the Black Plague and the Great Fire.  It is not that Merivel finds himself during these trying times, but rather than he remembers himself.  Downey's performance covers a lot of ground.  When he is the fool he embraces the role wholeheartedly, but at the end when he has restored to him the most precious thing that he has lost the look on his face is a moment of transcendent joy.  Of course, it is impossible to watch this film today and not wish the actor had taken its moral to heart.

I have enjoyed watching this film several times and one of these days I am going to have to read Tremain's novel.  I suspect that the screenplay by Rupert Walters is being extremely faithful, but I would also think that Tremain has all sorts of marvelous period details that I would enjoy.  Another thing that impresses me about Michael Hoffman's film is that it has Ian McKellen and Meg Ryan in what are essentially small, but pivotal, roles.  ""Restoration"" is a film where you just go along for the ride, enjoy the pretty pictures, and be surprised at the end to discover how far you have come from where you started.",1082505600,87,3489,4.468454258675079

It is a very strange take since Britons never went in for, and were never comfortable with, the opulence favoured by our continental cousins...it wasn't done you know...we've always been a bit reticent to pile on the treacle in that way. Consider if you will , for example, with more cause than any nation in the history of the world to have our kings declared Emperors, we never did...well the very idea, that was always something foreigners went in for at every opportunity. Still I liked this grandiose and flamboyant (to put it mildly) take on the restored monarchy, and it was as amusing as it was impressive, quite an achievement.
For the two Oscars it pulled (and deserved? just watch it) for Costumes and Art Direction, this film is definitely worth a look. See...now you've seen it you know don't you... Oscars are not the sham they're sometimes accused of being er!...Who's eating their words now then.
As a film of  two halves, and neither of them having (or seeming to have) a great deal in common with each other it is a difficult film to quantify. That said though for Robert Downey Jr. and his performance as the surgeon in the right place at the wrong time it ought to be compulsory viewing. Robert you are something to watch...I like you, well we all do...and I am never likely to ever meet or know you...what's your secret kid?",1029888000,3,1593,4.589473684210526
784337,5,6304106033,"Here is one of my favorite films and one of the best period pieces of recent years.  Occuring during the English Restoration period, it is also the story of a soul's restoration to recognize one's talents and one's destiny.  Based on the novel by Rose Tremain, it cuts across the events of the era using the life of the character Robert Merivel, played by Robert Downey, Jr.  The beauty of the costumes and art direction was accomplished within a miniscule budget (the total film budget was less than $20 million) but resulted in winning the Oscar for both categories.  As always, Mr. Downey Jr. proves that he is one of the top actors in America today.  It is a pity that his personal life has been so tragic and yet, here within this film, he portrays an individual bent on self-destruction rather than recognizing and exercising his talents.  You want to shout, ""Robert, do you watch any of your films?""  It is funny, touching and inspiring.  Sadly, not a box office smash, but it was a difficult movie to promote.  Also, pay attention to the film score, a great combination of classical music of the period and an excellent score by James Newton Howard.  And, to Mr. Downey Jr., who I hope can get his personal troubles behind him so that he can enjoy his talents, there is a line for him that is quite appropriate:  ""Lord, send a light to show Robert the way.""",1020902400,33,1365,4.530612244897959
784338,3,6304106033,"Robert Downey Jr. is great in the film. His portrayal of the degenerate young physician Merrivel is utterly convincing and his wine tired eyes really steal the show. I also enjoyed the first half of the film for its suggestion of flamboyance and energy: the beautiful sets are sumptuous and inspiring, which is more than can be said of the film's script. The court of Charles II is visually attractive, although the only criticism I can think of is that it could have been even more colourfully expressive for even greater effect.
  The second part of the film is weak. Clearly, Merrivel's restoration to a more morally tranquil character is intended, but it is painfully dull. This part of the film is like the countryhouse given to Merrivel by the King: dour and sanitised. There is absolutely nothing wrong with morality on screen, but the film succeeds in portraying it faithlessly and conventionally. The episode in the aslum is without emotional truth or intelligent characterisation; Meg Ryan, for her part, does not convince as an emotionally disturbed young woman. Also, Sam Neill is detrimentally neglected by the film; his demonic presence would have been so valuable to the narrative worth of the film as a whole that it is a disappointment to see him disappear for most of the second half. All in all, a good cast, (although Iain McKellen is lamentably given such a small role), an average script and good to watch only if you have a good bottle of sweet wine with you for the second half.",1004486400,2,1502,4.773076923076923

784340,5,6304106033,"All I can say is this is an amazing story. I for one like movies over their printed counterparts - especially when the actors and directors interpretations tell a fantastic story. This is that type of movie. Sam Neill is extraordinary as is Robert Downey Jr. who is playing a character similar to his real life.
I think it is a stunning movie visually but don't believe others that tell you this overshadows the plot or character development, it doesn't. In fact the point of the movie is the Restoration of Merivel (Downey) from a sensualist bent on wine, women and song, to recognize his true talents of a physician and the support that those close to him have given him. This movie is a journey for Merivel through the ups and downs of his life, from drunken debauchery of Charles II's court to fighting the great fire of London and the plague that struck Europe.
All in all I think the scenery is enough reason to get this movie. But don't believe for a minute that there isn't a compelling story, a true character transformation and plenty of conflict and resolution that would have made this movie a winner were it shot in black in white in the mountains.",994550400,5,1161,4.533333333333333

It's plot I must admit, is a bit slow however, the cinematography and set design make up for that.  The sets are astounding and if you want a film that gives you an idea of the gaudiness and decadance of the riegn of Charles II this is for you. It may not be historically accurate, but Robert Downey, Jr. performance makes you believe it happened that way.

Not only is ""Restoration"" well-written it is also a rush for the senses with brilliant colors, exquisite costumes, and a remarkable soundtrack.

7862041,5,6304106033,"Yes, this is a period piece, the movie was beautifully costumed, and the colors were brilliant. However, many movies can say that. These were great actors. They all made memorable movies before and after this one. Not all movies can say that they are more than the sum of their parts and that the characters were great enough to outshine the actors. However, this one is one of those movies. It really does not fit any category of movie unless you can call it inspirational.

Robert Merivel was the master and the sum of his choices. Even the circumstances that looked like her had no control over were the results of previous choices. This also applied to the other characters that surrounded him. The end is the results of the means. This is one movie that could not be remade.",1501977600,,779,4.564285714285714

7862050,5,6304106033,"Europe of the 1600's has often been an overlooked era, sandwiched between the idealism and art of the Elizabethan/Shakespearean Age (late 1500s) and the Enlightenment of the 1700's. In many ways, 1600s England was a transitional time reflecting the growth of England toward a modern sensibility while still being hindered by the traditions and outlooks of the past, primarily the hold of Medieval thought which held to a strict hierarchical strata while discouraging and even destroying the pursuit of knowledge and truth.

Robert Downey Jr. does a tremendous job as a character that appears to be a fore-runner of the coming Enlightenment. He is a physician on the verge of ground-breaking new scientific discoveries in the area of medicine. However, through a serendipitous and at first fortuitous run-in with King Charles II, the Restoration monarch (played brilliantly by Sam Neill), Downey loses his way and becomes a willing pawn in the king's sexual chess games. He even forsakes his precious medical texts to a colleague. In return, Downey gains a royal title, a royal tract of land, servants, and a wife. The only stipulation that is placed upon him: He cannot touch his own wife--she ultimately belongs to the King as one of his many mistresses.

In this way, Charles II is still a monarch enacting a role that was first prescribed in the Middle Ages: that of the absolute ruler with absolute authority that can use his subjects for his own whims, and he can also discard those that are no longer useful. Simultaneously, there is another side to Charles II. Although he is the son of his late father Charles I, Charles II is the heir to Cromwell who devoted time and money to philanthropic projects, such as the study of science and medicine, the improvement of architecture, and the creation of schools. Charles II continues the enterprises begun by Cromwell and becomes a transitional monarch who has aspects that reflect both the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment.

In many ways, Restoration is about these two worlds, and how Downey lives in both of them, from the luxurious life of a nobleman to the humble physician working with Quakers in an insane asylum. The king is also a person caught in both worlds. At first he appears the selfish ruler using his subjects as chess pieces in a large game in which he is always the bona fide winner. But then in another scene, we see him as a kind of philanthropic monarch financing and encouraging scientific and liberal research and discourse. In an interesting scene, Downey enters a kind of laboratory in which knowledge, research, and discovery are are being supported by the king who presides over the work of many scholars. Behind him is a strange swirling circus-like representation of the cosmos. We can't quite tell if the representation depicts the earth as the center of the Universe or the Sun, as if this notion is still being debated. But to his credit, the king is allowing for debate--something a Medieval king under a Medieval Church would have never allowed. Later, we learn that Downey is also an amateur astronomer, gazing at the stars in the heavens with a telescope.

Through his adventures in and out of these worlds, Downey sees the light and dark of both and becomes something greater than he had before, particularly through an episode in which he falls in love with one of the patients (Meg Ryan) at the insane asylum. One aspect of the film that is quite revealing is the shades of color used to represent the different ""worlds"". The world of the king is bright and colorful. The world of the Quakers is far more gray, but toward the end of the movie, the world of the king becomes darker hued.

In the end, even the King seems to understand the importance of scientific discourse and research--that these ideas could ultimately help not only his people but himself. Medieval monarchs played games with people's lives for their own selfish ends, and sometimes stifled those who could make positive contributions to their societies and even humanity at large. Restoration is about the transition from the Medieval model to a new societal design in which personal gain becomes an outcome of talent and contribution and not monarchical whim. Today, we are still challenged by the notion of privilege over substance. People in power still often give major opportunities to those they favor over those that could make important contributions who are less adept at playing the political game.",1430179200,,4471,4.8931398416886545
