1798796,1,B0000714BZ,"This review pertains to this DVD, and not the movie itself.  I LOVE this movie, and already have a copy on DVD.  When I saw that it was being re-released with a featurette, I was anxious to buy it for the extra footage.  The ""featurette"" is about 7 minutes long and is just a glorified trailer.  It contains lots of movie clips and some interview material.  The interview material focuses mostly on plot related topics and themes, and offers no insight into the making of the film or the beautiful location in Italy where it was shot.  If you do not own this movie and are looking to buy it on DVD, I would recommend it.  However, if you already own a copy of this movie on DVD and were thinking of buying this version for the featurette, don't waste your money.",1042156800,44,762,4.323943661971831
1798797,3,B0000714BZ,"Much Ado About Nothing is the lightest, most benign Shakespeare play produced by Hollywood in the Bard's 1990s renaissance.  Modern audiences will find this version to be enjoyable and entertaining, but lacking the weighty issues normally explored in his more serious works.
I am not exactly a connoisseur of Shakespeare's comedies, but a modern film version of one of his works is light-years ahead of the typical melodramas churned out by Hollywood.  Even though this particular play is limited by its simplistic ""black and white"" morality, the characters are complex and the plots and sub-plots go in directions that are not always predictable.
This play presents many of the devices common throughout much of Shakespeare's lighter works: hidden identity, love triangles, deception, usurped titles, etc.  Someone just beginning to tackle the Bard's canon could make no better choice than starting with this little tale.  I find it a much more appropriate play for High School Freshman than the popular choice of Romeo and Juliet.  Do we really want 13 year olds hearing that suicide is a way to show love?
Many people have problems with some of the cast in this production, and maybe this criticism is justified.  I find it interesting, however, to see Shakespeare performed by a wide range of modern actors.  This version gives us classically trained thespians, Hollywood movie stars, and whatever category best suits Keanu Reeves.",1041984000,3,1435,5.186147186147186
1798798,4,B0000714BZ,"Obviously there are many reviews for this film -- I don't want to take up too much space - just want to say that this film demonstrated to me that Branagh is a true talent. Henry V and Hamlet are both failures in my opinion -- although both have wonderful aspects, Branagh overacts severely... however his ranting and raving work well in this fine rendition. Emma Thompson is absolutely wonderful as his foil. Denzel is quite good as well. The actress who plays Hero is beautiful, and acts reasonably well. The actor who plays Claudio is utterly forgettable -- he would do well playing the part of a woman. But the worst is Keanu Reeves. I can only guess that Branagh chose him to attract young girls to this movie, otherwise it makes no sense... he is such a sorry actor -- I earnestly believe that many people who have NEVER acted in their lives could do at least as well as Keanu in this role if not better. His performance is an embarassment, and he should leave the profession and do something more suitable to whatever talents he does have (except Bill and Ted's, he was great in that.) But I digress. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful film -- restored my faith in Branagh. He should do more light roles like this and stay away from Hamlet &c.",1041724800,3,1255,4.413793103448276

Kenneth Branagh really has his finger on the pulse of the works of William Shakespeare & having the ability to adapt his work to film!!!  To adapt Shakespeare's works to film is to know your going to have to cut Shakespeare's words in half due to time constraints & make up for that editing with mood, & imagery & Kenneth Branagh seems to have it down to a science!!!

This version of the Shakespearean classic does honor to the bard with a comic portrayal by Michael Keaton that the actors of old would be in awe of.

How could you not fall in love with the love stories of these two couples and take a lesson on the challenge of loving that someone is not as easy as falling off an imaginary horse.

The film plays very well in color but Technicolor would have been far superior on the DVD played in a Blu-ray player on a 1080 P screen.  The scenic beautiful and magical  Umbrian countryside would have been far more enhanced in Technicolor.

I have not paid attention to Emma Thompson as an actress until recently in her excellent performance in Saving Mr. Banks.  I felt her performance was outstanding in this film made 20 years ago.  Not only is she a beautiful woman, she is an outstanding Shakespearean actor.  A surprise to me was Michael Keaton who also rendered an excellent performance.  I never thought that he would or could have pulled off such a performance.  Finally, I did not realize this film was the debut for Kate Beckinsale which she is not credited on the cover of the DVD.

They are so good that the first time I saw the movie -- a month or so after it came out -- the audience was laughing harder during their scenes than they were for Dogberry's scenes.  I'm not a weepy movie watcher -- but I get a lump in my throat in response to several scenes -- e.g., when old Antonio and Leonato come to Hero's defense.

The verbal duelling between Beatrice and Benedick is interrupted by laugh-track guffaws from a cast of extras.

1799104,5,B0000714BZ,"When most think of Shakespeare, an involuntary bile rises in their throat. They gag and grimace. Thanks to legions of English teachers and textbooks around the world, Shakespeare has gotten a bad name, and in turn, has been overlooked by much of the general public.

Kenneth Branagh wants to change that.

His Much Ado About Nothing is a fun, glorious, light-hearted romp through sun baked Tuscany. His cast is a well-chosen mix of Shakespearean veterans and talented thesps (excluding of course, Keanu Reeves, whose ""angsty"" performance comes off as un-inspired). It's a contagious mix of laughs, loves, betrayals, duels, wit and just a lot of fun.

Branagh shines as Benedick, and Emma Thompson makes a worthy foe as his love/hate Beatrice. The two actors' chemistry is palpable, and their wit and banter is razor sharp. Denzel is surprisingly good as the Prince, Richard Briers is typically brilliant, and the young Kate Beckinsale shines as Hero. Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton feel out of place, but in my opinion, they don't detract from the film.

The cinematography is beautiful, lush, and, at times, amazing (check out the thundering opening scene with the horsemen). Patrick Doyle, one of the most underrated film composers of our time gives a typically phenomenal score. The result is a film that is both a brilliant adaptation of the Bard's finest comedy (don't quote me on that...), and a fun, lively comedy that Shakespeare diehards and casual watchers can enjoy!

1799112,5,B0000714BZ,"Mounting a production of Shakespeare is no easy task; neither is watching one. Sometimes the Old English is so hard to decipher it may as well be a different language.  And while you are trying to decipher it, you miss hearing the lines that follow.  Add to that plots that are sometimes a cat's cradle of complexity and references and custnms that are sometimes obscure and, quite frankly, more often than not I could use a little help.
Enter Kenneth Branagh and his exquisite production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
Branagh combines word with song, with dance, with the rustling of a leaf, with falls and pools of water in which beautiful young men and women bathe, with the galloping of coursers over the Tuscan countryside, and, of course, with the inspired explication of Shakespeare's lines by the brilliant performances of the actors so that you drink the play in with your eyes, your ears, your skin, your whole being.

1799116,4,B0000714BZ,"This is one of Shakespeare's most chaotic plays, and you know that is saying something. It's a great deal of fun, and I only have one complaint. Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves are supposedly brothers. Half-brothers I could accept, although even that would not be easy. But brothers??? And one to blame Old Bill for: Hero is a girl's name??????

Anyway, the lovely Hero (Kate Beckinsale) is in love with Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), just back from some rather unspecified adventure in the service of Prince Don Pedro (Denzel Washington). Her father had promised her to the Prince, but when he finds that she and Claudio are in love, he is happy to speak to her and to her father and rearrange things so the lovers can wed. Of course there must be some misunderstanding first, but that's easily worked out.

Or is it? Turns out Don John (Keanu Reeves) was only pretending to be reconciled to his brother, and actually plots to do him in. And since Claudio is clearly in Don Pedro's favor, he plots against him, too. The idea being, I suppose that since Don Pedro vouched for Claudio to Hero's father, he'll cause a rift all around. I'll let that part of the story play itself out without revealing anything more.

Anyway, Hero's cousin Beatrice (Emma Thompson) is a high-spirited and rather scornful girl who says she will never marry. Don Pedro and Claudio's friend Benedick (Kenneth Branagh, who played Professor Lockhart in the Harry Potter series) also vows he will never marry. In fact, he and Beatrice have been trading insults for years. So of course his friends conclude that they love each other, and plot to bring them together. And as most of us know, those who argue constantly do sometimes love each other; they simply love arguing.

After every possible mix-up, plenty of bawdy humor, and lots of lush costumes and settings, it all ends happily, with the two couples properly married. Even if you were forced to read it as a student, you should be able to enjoy this one. As with much of Shakespeare, it is far easier to understand when you can attach a face to a character and see by inflection, gesture and so on, what the sometimes rather awkward phrasing is saying.",1336867200,2,2187,4.6875

1799119,5,B0000714BZ,"This movie version of the famous Shakespeare comedy is splendid in every respect, actors, scenery, plot, plot development, and despite the ancient English, this play is easy to understand. Although the play is titled ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" implying that there is nothing of significance happening, as if love and destroying people are nothing, there is much action about significant and interesting matters. There are two love stories and an attempt to harm a brother, who is a prince, and the people who are his friends. One man and one woman, the best actors in the film, declare repeatedly that they have no intention of ever marrying anyone and especially not each other. In fact, when the two encounter each other, they constantly mock one another with clever language. The prince and his friends develop a plot to make the two fall in love. The second love tale concerns one of the prince's men who is in love with a woman. The prince encourages him to marry her and helps him woo the woman. But there is a tragedy associated with this love story because of the third major plot. The prince's brother and his helpers decide to destroy the planned wedding. This film is so good, so funny, and so easy to understand that I even recommend it for people who generally don't like Shakespeare plays.",1327536000,,1302,4.740088105726873
1799120,5,B0000714BZ,"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING falls somewhen during Kenneth Branagh's run of remarkable movies almost two decades ago, at a time when Branagh was being touted as cinema's newest fair-haired filmmaker. To me, this movie - in the wake of HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN, and PETER'S FRIENDS - cemented him as one of my favorite actor/directors. It'll be a hard job to find someone who's made the Bard of Avon more accessible without reinventing his plays into contemporary settings. HENRY V was rife with fiery patriotism and the brooding storm clouds of war. Conversely, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING was one of Shakespeare's occasional stabs at a romantic comedy. Branagh adopts Shakespeare's playful tone and memorable words and opens up the story for mass consumption. MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING gives us moments of frolic and merriment, dark deceit, transcendent romance, and, most enjoyably, those verbal barbs traded by Branagh and Thompson's characters. As the good ditty says, ""Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more.""

Branagh establishes the lively and sensuous mood early, his opening passage redolent with glimpses of healthy folk gamboling on the hillside, wine and grape and cheese and such foods of passion within reach. A cheer erupts as a party of horsemen is seen arriving from the distance, the victorious Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon (Denzel Washington), and his entourage home from the war and come to grace Signor Leonato's sun-drenched Tuscan villa for a month's stay of leisure. What follows is a celebratory and even erotic sequence as the men and women bathe and romp in communal facilities. That dude Bacchus, he'd be beaming with pride.

The plot tracks two love stories, one conventional, the other combative. Three men make up Don Pedro's immediate circle: Count Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), Benedick (Branagh), and Don Pedro's scowling half-brother Don John (Keanu Reeves). When young Claudio sets eyes on their host's beautiful daughter Hero (Kate Beckinsale, in her film debut), he is immediately besotted, and, likewise, Hero with Claudio. Hence, a marriage is rapidly arranged. But there must be character conflict, else what's the worth of a story? The progression of festivities is interrupted by the connivings of Don John, jealous, saturnine, and the play's self-professed ""plain-dealing villain."" Don John employs impostors to convince Claudio and Don Pedro that Hero is a loose woman. An enraged Claudio denounces Hero on their wedding day which results in Hero's death. It'll take the rest of the film to straigthen out this sordid tangle.

Hero has a cousin, the spirited Beatrice (Emma Thompson) and her caustic banter with smug confirmed bachelor Benedick is a film highlight, as is their uneasy courtship. Denzel Washington's commanding and elegant Don Pedro is instrumental in igniting this narrative arc. He playfully vows to Benedick: ""I shall see you ere I die look pale with love."" And so begins the devious matchmaking, a trap which Benedick and ""My Dear Lady Disdain"" readily fall into.

Branagh's adaptation has made MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. It's probably no coincidence that HENRY V is also right up there for me. Branagh's knack for building a bridge between Shakespeare and today's crowd is amazing. He also does an interesting thing here by casting British and American actors, his point being that it doesn't require an English accent to do justice to these classics. I thought Denzel and Robert Sean Leonard were effortless in the way they rolled off the Bard's dialogue. One Shakespearean element I can take or leave is the playwright's penchant for introducing oafish comedic characters, which leaves Michael Keaton in a sticky place. His interpretation of the slob constable, Dogberry, is broad and weird, but at least he tries to make it interesting. Dogberry's malapropisms cause Don Pedro to remark at one point: ""This learned constable is too cunning to be understood."" Heh.

The score is rousing, the story is timeless. The battle of the sexes, invigorating. Wine, dancing, and song permeate the narrative. Passions erupt. Allegiances are forsworn, duels declared. But, underneath it all, Branagh infuses a sense of joyousness, a celebration of life. In the face of such blithe, it's difficult to attach sad credence even to a statement as grim and final as ""Done to death by slanderous tongues was the Hero that here lies.""

And now I finally have it on DVD! This movie was a turning point of sorts for me--finally, I connected with Shakespeare.  Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson's exquisite performances made the words leap off the page and take flight.  Despite the intricate prose (albeit with a couple of scenes and lines deleted), the Elizabeathan English made sense to me as it never had before.  I was originally surprised to find out such witicisms as ""Here comes the Prince and Monsiuer Love"" and ""There's a double meaning in that"" were direct from the play itself, and not anachronistic additions by Branagh.  Simply said, this production and Branagh's scintillating direction re-introduced my high school-Shakespeare-weary self to Shakespeare as a comic and dramatic genius.

The sparks between Branagh and Thompson's Benedick and Beatrice and powerful and passionate, and Shakepeare's conception of love borne out of the desire not to have one's enemy's love go unrequited--though it is suggested throughout that B&B might have been lovers fallen out of love before the play begins--is hilarious while it is insightful.  The scene in the garden where Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato deceive Benedick has me laughing out loud no matter how many times I view the scene.

And speaking of Don Pedro, bravo to Branagh for casting Denzel Washington--a risky choice, no doubt, but one that worked out to perfection.  I'm so used to seeing Washington as an angry black man in films focusing on either civil rights, hostage crises, or serial killers, that it is delightful to see him here as a magestic, jovial Italian prince--benignly leading the shenanigans.

Alas, there are some weaknesses, such as Michael Keaton channeling Beetlejuice into his interpretation of Dogberry, though the malapropisms are hilarious (I would bestow all my tediousness on you!).  Similarly, Keanu Reeves as Don John is dull.  However, the radiance that is Thompson and Branagh in this gloriously sunlight adaption outweigh that concern.  Robert Sean Leonard is fine as Claudio: earnest and gullible to a fault.  Kate Beckinsdale is the picture of innocent maidenhood. Also, one plot point that always annoyed me: why didn't Margaret come forward?  I suppose it was fear of the consequences to herself, but given such a selfish motivation when Hero's life and honor are at stake makes the easy way in which she is forgiven at the end seem a bit unbelievable, even for an unbelievable play.

Everything is not perfect however.  Spectators are implicitly asked to play along and accept various incongruities.  Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, for instance, are at least ten years too old for their parts.  Also, it requires quite a leap of faith to acknowledge Robert Sean Leonard as Denzel Washington's brother.

1799169,4,B0000714BZ,"Much Ado About Nothing although worthy of Shakespeare, is one of his lesser pieces in my opinion. The play has amazing language and minor details that are truly a tribute to Shakespeare's unparallel skill however it pales in comparison to some of Shakespeare's other works. The reader may enjoy the magnificent word choice that can only be expected from one of Shakespeare's works but in this play the frivolity of the plot is undeserving of its complex characters.
 Although this is a play about love the audience never really experiences a relationship develop naturally. In fact, the play almost implies that love can only be born of artificial design. The two most pivotal relationships in the play are that of Hero and Claudio and Beatrice and Benedick. The former pair was made by the desires of Claudio and the well-bred obedience of Hero, not by a mutual fascination. Their romantic plot also comes dangerously close to that of Romeo and Juliet, in that both women (Hero and Juliet) fake their own deaths so that they may be with the ones they supposedly love. Also neither woman has spent much time in the company of the objects of their affections. The men, Claudio and Romeo, also share striking similarities. They are both willing to believe the appearance of reality and not delve for the truth. These similarities suggest that if the plot of Hero and Claudio continued, although it ends in comedy in the original play, will eventually end in tragedy. The Romantic Plot of Beatrice and Benedick has more depth then that of Hero and Claudio. Their romantic relationship is completely create by circumstance. As their relationship develops the reader can see a distinct change in Beatrice, her speak changes from prose to verse. However this transformation does not occur in the speech of Benedick. Does this mean that Benedick only thinks himself in love due to the way his peers manipulated his emotions? Or is Shakespeare commenting that the love of a women is completely separate from that of a man?
 The Plot of Much Ado About Nothing like the title suggests is about nothing.  Although the play does process villains and many heroes. In my opinion the villains are diluted for a piece by Shakespeare and the chaos they cause is easily resolved. The heroes also suffer from the length of the play; I discovered that I felt little sympathy for many of them. The grow and development of the characters in my opinion are stunt because of the simplicity of the plot.
 I would give this play four out of five stars. To me it was much easier to understand than many of Shakespeare's other works but it also lacked much of their depth. Although it was a satisfying read and I would not discourage anyone from reading it.

1799170,4,B0000714BZ,"William Shakespeare is remembered in the popular consciousness as the greatest writer who ever lived (not undeservedly), but the images that still come to most minds when thinking of him are almost all from the tragedies:  Hamlet contemplating a skull (usually while giving a monologue from a completely different scene), Romeo and Juliet together in death, and the like.  The Tragedies (and, to a lesser extent, the Histories) dominate the public mind.  Director Kenneth Branagh had made his career with a spectacular film version of ""Henry V"", and would later film a full-length ""Hamlet""; in between comes this film, which attempts to put one of Shakespeare's Comedies on the screen.  Shakespeare loved comedy, both witty and bawdy, but those plays (and comedic scenes in his more serious ones) have suffered in later centuries as linguistic change strips away recognition of the jokes, particularly the dirty ones (the title ""Much Ado About Nothing"" has three meanings in Elizabethan understanding, only one of which would be apparent to contemporary audiences, and it's the least-naughty one).  Branagh and his talented cast succeed admirably.

Our story opens in Italy (not that it especially matters), as Don Pedro (Denzel Washington; Branagh's a devotee of colour-blind casting; I have some issues with that approach, but it works better in comedy than in drama) and his men return from a victorious war, and vacation at the estate of Leonato (Branagh regular Richard Briers).  Don Pedro's entourage includes his bastard half-brother Don John (Keanu Reeves), and allies Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Benedick (Branagh himself); Claudio is in love with Leonato's daughter Hero (a young Kate Beckinsale), while Benedick and Leonato's niece Beatrice (Emma Thompson, Branagh's then-wife and frequent onscreen partner) hate each other.  The later two are one of the prototypical couple who mistake their love for each other for deep dislike (or is it the other way around?), and Don Pedro, apparently for fun, decides to try and convince each that the other is secretly in love with them (which I guess also makes this one of the earlier ""rich people decide to mess around with the plebes on a wager"" stories).  Don John, meanwhile, is out to do evil.

The casting is, as one can see, eclectic, and also includes other Branagh regulars Brian Blessed and Jimmy Yuill, and Michael Keaton as a particularly bizarre Constable Dogberry.  Branagh and Thompson, in their last onscreen collaboration before the dissolution of their marriage, are typically excellent; they know how to deliver this type of material.  Denzel Washington, who you rarely seen in comedy or would associate with the Bard (he also played the title role in a Broadway production of ""Julius Caesar""), is also good.  Keanu Reeves' casting has tended to be criticized, and while Reeves is an undeniably limited actor, I don't think he's out of his depth here:  Don John is a bargain basement Richard III, who proudly proclaims his desire to do be evil solely for the sake of doing evil; roles don't get much more one-dimensional (and proud of it).  Beckinsale and Leonard are just sort of there as the other couple; both are good actors, but the parts don't have a huge amount to them, and they can't compete with Branagh and Thompson.  The cast and crew do a great job of bringing out of the comedy in the play, in many cases using inflection and body language to resuscitate obsolete puns, and adding in physical comedy.  Of course, Branagh's whole career on film has been about freeing Shakespeare productions from the stereotype of stuffiness.

Recommended.",1270166400,,3631,5.084175084175084
1799171,3,B0000714BZ,"I suspect the amount of enjoyment one receives out of this film is probably inversely proportional to how well one knows the play. Visual cues and musical swells often move the plot along instead of dialog or spoken exposition, Branagh working from a text that seems to encompass about half the original material. All of this combines to create a sort of pastiche of the best bits of the play where it's difficult to really get emotionally involved. The pace of the original play, for example, curiously serves to increase suspense, rather than plod, but here Don John's scheme is no sooner hatched than it is unraveled, markedly eliminating much of the tension of the last two acts. I just don't take the threat to the main characters as seriously as I should. I am not, on principle, opposed to reduced-text, filmed versions of plays (Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night is a good example of a radically cut text that nonetheless remains true to the source material; Branagh's own Henry V is another), but I do not think it works well here (except in a generalized, slightly saccharine sort of way).

My second criticism of the production is, to my eye, much more damning-- namely the mish-mash of accents and (especially) acting styles that works to undermine the coherence of the film. A good example of this occurs in Act I, Scene I where Don Pedro, Claudio, and Benedict have a verbal exchange about Hero and the merits of marriage in general. Robert Sean Leonard speaks in a faux-British accent, Denzel Washington in a distinctly American one, and Branagh himself with the sort of elocution only to be found on the British stage. Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington are clearly playing the character (with seemingly little awareness of the language itself) while Branagh obviously relishes each line, making a variety of choices in inflection and pace that betrays not only his stage background and formal training, but his obvious awareness of what the language of the text can do for an actor. It feels a bit like as if John Gielgud were playing the part of Brutus in a high school production of Julius Caesar: it sticks out that much.

In general, it's obvious which actors know Shakespeare and which ones don't, and often it seems like the players might as well be appearing in different films. The most extreme example of this is the unsuccessful casting/performances of Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton, a complete non-performance in the former and a grotesque, over-the-top caricature in the latter. They are both completely out of their depth.

All of this is not to suggest there are not good things about the film. Branagh and Thompson are both wonderful; the locations are gorgeous; and the tone of the original play is often successfully re-created through the use of visuals and music. On the whole, though, I would offer only a marginal recommendation to those who care about the play, though I can imagine it being viewed with a much more sympathetic eye by audiences who see the text as an obstacle, rather than the primary virtue. In this sense, it is a successful popularization.",1267315200,11,3101,4.836158192090395

1799184,2,B0000714BZ,"Very Shakespeare meets Jane Austen meets...`Mama Mia', `Much Ado About Nothing' is in the very least an interesting feat.  It has elements that work and elements that don't, and while certain parts (or at least one part) of this film are spellbinding, as a whole I don't really feel I can agree with the consensus (who seem to really, really love this movie).

The film is a hodgepodge of matchmaking, lover's quarrels and deceitful jealousies, and while Shakespearian legend Kenneth Branagh tries to give the film enough sparkle and enough darkness he fails to really give the film a solid flow.  Add to this the fact that barely any of the actors are suitable for their parts (which in some areas is rather shocking) and you have a film that fails to live up to the hype for me.  I will admit that I am not the hugest follower of this type of film, so many of you may feel that has hindered me in my approach to rating this film, but I must say that I was genuinely excited for and longing to see this and that I have enjoyed very much other films of this sort.

This one is just missing so much.

The few who have actually given this a negative review have balked at the plot, which I think is one of the few things that cannot be balked at.  I actually found the story being told to be an interesting and amiable one.  Young Claudio is in love with Leonato's daughter Hero and so Don Pedro takes it upon himself to get the two acquainted while struggling to draw out feuding Beatrice and Benedick's true feelings for one another.  Don John own evil jealousies have caused him to seek ruination of Claudio's love at any means necessary.  It's actually quite absorbing.

But alas, the temperamental shifts in the film don't sit well with me.  The handling of the flighty quirkiness of the characters and the dastardly subplot involving Don John are uneven to me, and the random musical numbers come off rather unnecessary to me.

And then there is the acting.

I will say this first; Emma Thompson is utterly brilliant here and deserved an Oscar, and Kenneth Branagh is, unsurprisingly, right at home and very, very good.  Sadly, they are the only saving graces here.  Denzel Washington seems so uncomfortable here and actually comes off like a young child in an adult production.  Michael Keaton does nothing but his Beetlejuice shtick, and he does it poorly.  Keanu Reeves is, in my opinion, the worst actor working today or maybe even ever, and his Razzie nomination for this very film is not unjustified.  The forgettable Robert Sean Leonard (I mean, really, can you remember his performance in any of his movies?  He's always outshone by everyone else) is once again, forgettable (and very amateurish) and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale is nothing but pure eye candy with no real talent to back it up.  Like I said, some of this is shocking (ok, Washington is the only one that is really shocking) but that's how the cards fell.

I'll take a minute to just bask in the glory of Emma Thompson though, since she is an utter delight.  This is one of those rare occasions when a performance is leagues better than the film that owns it.  She completely captures the free spirited wit of this young woman with the perfect mixture of sarcasm and determination.  She is a woman in love yet she is stubborn in her own ideals.  She is tender yet not weak and she is her own woman, complete with a fiery life growing within her.  All of this boisterous nature and yet her most compelling and startling scene comes when she bares her darkest emotions (that whole ""kill Claudio"" scene is FLAWLESS).  She knows how to make this character work in her entirety, even if the film attempts the same and comes off uneven.

So, see it for Thompson, because it is one of the best supporting performances of the 90's, but know in advance that there are far better films of this nature to be seen.",1245369600,4,3881,4.535919540229885

Given the fact that neither of his most recent Shakespearean adaptations have received so much as a DVD release out here (Australia), let alone a cinema release, it is hard to imagine that there was once a time when Kenneth Branagh was hailed as being the next Laurence Olivier. However, back in the 1990's, Kenneth Branagh did manage to produce some of the best Shakespearean adaptations ever made, the best of which being the 4-hour ""Hamlet"" and this version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"".

 ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is rare among Shakespeare's comedies in that it is actually funny, thus making it one of Shakespeare's most accessible plays, and Kenneth Branagh has a gift for making Shakespeare understandable to anyone, even someone who has never encountered ""the Bard"" before. Not all of the actors are up to the same standard as Branagh (Kate Beckinsale, in an early film role, is notably wooden), but this is more than made up for by Branagh and Thompson. Branagh and Thompson are both excellent actors in anything in which they appear, but they are at their best when appearing together.

They quickly become involved in love triangles, treachery, and tongue lashings from Leonato's niece Beatrice (Emma Thompson).

While this film holds true to the english of Shakespeare's writing, it is by no means difficult to understand.  It is merely english used in a way we as a society are not used to, but are capable of.  The humor is timeless as well since love and conniving, not to mention bickering, are parts of life we all laugh about when looking back at it.",1205020800,2,1045,4.9314285714285715
1799205,4,B0000714BZ,"Beautifully photographed and brilliantly executed in the Tuscan sunshine, this film version captures all the energy and charm of Shakespeare's famous comedy.  The cast is surprisingly long on Americans-thankfully NOT burdened here with those painfully fake English accents that we so often must endure-but under Branagh's excellent direction, even the unlikely casting of Keanu as the Bad Seed brother of Denzel's Don Pedro is not too hard to swallow (and Michael Keaton's constable is just classic comedy).  Dialogue is condensed but true to the meter-and the ""meat""-of the original, and retains all the metaphor, pun, double-entendre and wordplay which reveal the Bard's genius.  Branagh himself is thoroughly splendid as Benedick; as Beatrice, the always brilliant Emma Thompson has never been more lovely.

1799233,5,B0000714BZ,"Shakespeare and his entangled love affairs are as famous as Dracula and his blood cult. But we recognize here the friar who advises a fake death to the girl and we remember that Romeo and Juliet came first in 1596. Shakespeare started with the tragedy around the clandestine marriage of the two heroes, and then moved on to a comedy that sounds at time very tragic, Much Ado About Nothing in 1598, and he doubles the merriment by having two weddings. And he will go on with As You Like It in 1600 and its four marriages under the auspices of the thrice crowned goddess Diana. And this was a model of perfection that he had kept from A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1594. But this present comedy could have been a drama at least if not a tragedy since the death being false, based on a false accusation what's more, could have led to a duel and one real death before being discovered as a fake, and it leads to the arrest of the villain who had arranged the fakery so that a happy love wedding was turned into a dramatic denunciation of the impurity of the bride. That's probably why he doubled the first line of action with a second that reminds us of The Taming of the Shrew (1593) and that second line will lead to the second marriage that will bring everyone, except the plotter, to merriment, gaiety and dancing. But this production is admirable because the setting of the play in a real garden and rich mansion in more or less renaissance clothing though it could be slightly more recent gives to the actors all the space they need to dance, play, hide, run, and many other things. The acting is admirable and they really make the language sing the way it should, sing joy as well as pain, sing sadness as well as happiness. Of course the language is also a little bit difficult but we get used to it very fast and we follow the music of it as well as the words, and the actors were directed into speaking as if they were singing, to the point of even having a failed attempt at real singing that sounds like a cat being disemboweled. And the final but suspended lack of clemency against the guilty plotter is there to remind us that everything may end with songs and dances, but there is always some drama to bring to an end sooner or later, and in that case outside the time limits of the play. But yet I always wonder about what such comedies, or tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, could look like in Shakespearean times when women were not allowed on the stage. So many girls played by teenagers must have been funny, with an echo in the play when Beatrice speaks of men with a beard or men without a beard and the latter are less of a man than she would ever like. That was said by a man without a beard in 1598. I guess we would find it funny and even maybe ridiculous today. But it should be attempted. Shakespeare played on the situation quite often with varying motivations.

Branagh's adaptation is lush and splendidly well arranged.  The only flaw, in my opinion, is Keanu Reeves, who simply fails to project any soul into his role.

1799238,5,B0000714BZ,"1993's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is Kenneth Branagh's superb film rendering of Shakespeare's classic romantic comedy.  Veteran Shakespeare actors Branagh, Emma Thompson, and Brian Blessed are joined by veteran Hollywood actors Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton.  The movie features the then-young actors Keanu Reeves, Robert Sean Leondard, and Kate Beckinsale.

The movie is set at a sun-drenched and sumptious villa in Tuscany, where all have assembled for the pending wedding of Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale).  To the pass the time before the wedding, Don Pedro (Denzel Washington) sets up a romantic trap for the confirmed bachelor Benedick (Branagh) and his arch nemesis Beatrice (Thompson), who delight in their verbal tormenting of each other.  Don Pedro allows the two to believe that each is intent on wooing the other.  This deception is the heart of the movie, as through some delightful dialogue and hilarious scenes, Beatrice and Benedick arrive at a new appreciation of each other.

The romantic mood is almost spoiled by Don Juan (Keanu Reeves), who seeks to undermine the relationship of Claudio and Hero by suggesting that Hero has been unfaithful.  Reeves looks uncomfortable with the material and his wooden performance as the villian shows it.  Fortunately, the local sheriff (Michael Keaton), a bumbling, manic barrage of malapropisms, uncovers Don Juan's plot and saves the day.

Despite being early evening while watching it, it made me drowsy because I was bored, bored, bored. I have only been bored once before while watching a Shakespeare production. I found this film was an adaptation and not a faithful rending of this play unlike Shakespearean stage productions with which I am more familar. Despite being a fan of Emma Thompson, Keanu Reeves (gasp!), and some of the other stars (but not Mr. Branagh), their presence did not make up for what I felt was lacking in this lavish production.

An interesting side fact: Dogberry in Shakespeare's play is famous for his malapropisms. The word malaprop entered the English language more a century and a half later (it did not exist in Shakespeare's time). It came from Sheridan's comedic play ""The Rivals"" and is based on the character of Mrs. Malaprop who delightfully mangles English. I like the sound of malapropism better than dogberryism for a word meaning mangled English. As a person who loves the English language, I am glad we waited a century and a half for Mrs. Malaprop to arrive and mint a new word that is used to this day.",1173052800,12,2224,4.5703517587939695

Beatrice is the smartest girl in the room - any room.  Her trouble is that she loves a defiant, bull-headed, and notorious man from her past.  And she is betwixt with herself, not liking that she has feelings and concern for her gender rival - Benedick.  Beatrice is good humored, disarmingly wickedly tongued, and always torn between her loves and her independence.  Benedick is self-involved, conceited, & constantly fighting.  ""They never meet, but there is a skirmish of wit between them.""

Beatrice:  I wonder that you will still be talking, Senor Benedick.  Nobody marks you.
Benedick:  What?  My dear Lady Disdain.  Are you yet living?
Beatrice:  Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meat food to feed as her Senor Benedick.  Courtesy herself should convert to Disdain if YOU come in her presence.
Benedick:  . . . But it is certain that I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.  And I would that I could find in my heart that I had a hard heart, for truly I love none.
Beatrice:  A dear happiness to women.  They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.

I have my favorite movie lines from this DVD recorded on a 16 minute compilation on my iPod.  I do this because I'm not smart enough to ""get"" Shakespeare the first time I hear it.  I listen to them repeatedly, not only to try to understand the words, but also to understand the intelligence behind how they were so well acted by Branagh and Thompson.  This Shakespearean play succeeds or fails in the casting of Beatrice, and in this version, Emma Thompson plays Beatrice divinely.

At a turning point in the movie, Don Pedro, played capably by Denzel Washingion, visits with a pensive Beatrice.  Beatrice is discussing with Don Pedro her past trials with Benedick:

Don Pedro:  You have put him down lady.  You have put him down.
Beatrice:  So I would not he should do me, my lord.  Lest I should prove the mother of fools.
Don Pedro:  Will you have me lady?
Beatrice:  (Carefully) No my lord.  Unless I might have another for working days.  Your grace is too costly to wear everyday.  But I beseech your grace, pardon me.  I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
Don Pedro:  Your silence most offends me.  And to merry best becomes you, for out of question you were born in a merry hour.
Beatrice:  No!  Sure my lord.  My mother cried.  But then there was a star danced.  And under that was I born.

Benedick later sililoquys that he will not marry, until he finds all positive attributes he seeks in only one woman.

Smart women tend to be able to recognize gifted men and women who cross their path.  Fortunately, most Beatrices encounter a few Benedicks & Beatrices in their travels, and vice versa.

In a final scene, Benedick asks Beatrice, ""Then you do not love me?""  Beatrice replies, ""No!  Truly!  But in friendly recompense.""

There are more good reasons than I can understand why Shakespeare's ideas withstand the tests of time.  This film version is so very, very good.  As with most Shakespearean comedies and tragedies, the plots hinge on several key misunderstandings.  In his romantic tragedies, the misunderstandings (such as Romeo & Juliet) are not discovered until too late.  In the comedies, the misunderstandings are discovered in time.",1153785600,4,3378,4.691780821917808

1799267,4,B0000714BZ,"There is no way around it, no matter how it is staged Shakespeare will inevitably feel like a stage play. That it is acted by two of Britains foremost stage actors of the time, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson (who at this stage were still married) adds to the feeling. There is some over the top voice projection, but generally this feels light, fun and a pretty glorious rendition of one of Shakespeares frothiest plays.

Much ado about nothing really is just what it says. The premise is that the duke returns from the wars with a half-brother whom dislikes him but has reconciled with him simply to create problems. Which he manages to do, embroiling the hapless Hero (the heroine of the story!) and her love.  It is all based on falsehood and nothing.

Branagh and Thompson play the battling ex-lovers who are reconciled during the course of the movie, but this doesn't stay their battling wits and shrewdness. This is one point where their clear diction and stage presence makes a huge difference as each word and inference can be celarly understood.

There are wonderful set scenes - the arrival of the duke and his men, and the finish with the dancing through the grounds was gorgeous.

1799269,5,B0000714BZ,"Kenneth Branagh wrote, directed and starred in this most joyful of all romantic comedies. It is much ado about nothing, because misunderstanding abounds, especially between confirmed bachelor, Benedick (Branagh), and scornfully disinterested Beatrice (Emma Thompson, who was married to Branagh at the time). The prince, Don Pedro of Aragon (Denzel Washington), arrives at the home of Signor Leonato (Richard Briars) in Tuscany for a long vacation. He brings with him a coterie of his soldiers, including his disgruntled half-brother, Don Jon (Keanu Reeves). When Benedick and Beatrice swear that they will never fall in love with anyone and will always remain single, Don Pedro and his friends plan a lovers trap to bring them together. Two of their party have already fallen to Cupid's arrow: Beatrice's cousin Hero, played by Kate Beckinsale, and Claudio, played by Robert Sean Leonard. There is also a plot afoot by Don Jon to break up this upcoming wedding by spreading false rumors about Hero. Before it's all over, there is quite a tempest in the nuptial teapot.

This is Branagh second extremely successful Shakespearian film, the first being Henry V. Both are exquisitely staged, photographed and acted. This one is unique in that it exudes more joy than I've ever seen in a film. From the opening credits to the final wedding celebration, there is a feeling of gleeful bliss. This film was nominated for no Academy Awards that I am aware of, though it was certainly worthy. When I sold my VHS collection several years ago to replace it with DVD's, more people wanted Much Ado than any other film. Why it was overlooked by the Academy is unclear, but there will probably never be a better or more faithful rendering of this wonderful play.

1799280,5,B0000714BZ,"My first exposure to the genius of Kenneth Branagh was last year in English class. We watched Hamlet and I was so impressed by the ability of Branagh to deliver difficult Shakespeare lines as though they were contemporary English. I did some research and found this romantic comedy. Romantic comedy? Shakespeare? All I knew of Shakespeare was tradegy, jealousy, and envy. So you can imagine what a wonderful suprise this film was!

I object only slightly to the questionable casting; some actors just don't seem to fit the bill. However, the performances of Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh more than make up for the less-than-perfect ones of others. The two, married at the time, are a delight to watch onscreen, bickering and sparring with witty words that only Shakespeare could dream of.

The setting is Messina, Italy, an idyllic paradise seemingly cut off from the world. Indeed, the only whiff of reality we get is the notion of men returning from an unnamed war. This is really the tale of two sets of lovers, Benedick and Beatrice and the younger pair, Claudio and Hero. Benedick and Beatrice fight a merry battle of words that ends, thankfully, just before someone's heart really gets broken. The other love story is given more gravity but is lackluster compared to the tale of the older pair.

If you have ever shied away from Shakespeare due to complexity of language, then, I pray you, watch this film and be astounded by the universality of his themes. Put on subtitles and get lost in the wonderful way the Bard weaves his words, and immerse yourself in the pitch-perfect deliveries of those words in the hands of such veteran actors such as Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson.

A young Kate Beckinsale fulfills her duty of looking pretty, but doesn't contribute much to the acting talent of the film. Emma Thompson looks ravishing in low-cut white dresses, tanned and wind-swept. The heat of the Italian summer certainly released some passions in these actors, as evidenced on the screen.

1799283,4,B0000714BZ,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" is an exuberant comedy that has delighted audiences for hundreds of years.  This film provides some pretty good acting.  And though the acting is uneven, I have seen that on stage at the Royal Shakespeare Theater at Stratford-Upon-Avon.  The pace and energy of the film is almost manic and there are many laugh out loud moments.  However, I think that Branagh let the adaptation drift a bit too far into being about a film rather than Shakespeare's language, which is what Shakespeare should always be about.  Also, did we really need to see so many bare backsides?  I know this is a bit of a lusty comedy, but this is really a bit much for a family film as is the scene at the window where Claudio is deceived.  Answering that this isn't meant as a children's film is not enough because we all want to teach our children to love Shakespeare, and while we don't want it bowdlerized, we don't need it made so that the visuals distract one from the words.

In any case, there is much to love in the play, Beatrice most of all.  Here she is given life by the wonderful Emma Thompson.  Benedick is done broadly by Branagh and is quite enjoyable if not everyone's interpretation of Benedick.  This movie is full of movie stars as well.  Denzel Washington as Don Pedro (always a delight on the screen), Keanu Reeves as Don John (appropriately a man of few words), Michael Keaton as Dogberry (effective at times, but far too broad - the Monty Python horseless horse thing got to be tiresome), Robert Sean Leonard as Claudio, and a quite young Kate Beckinsale as the pure and ideal Hero.

For me, the most enjoyable performance was Richard Briers as Signor Leonato.  He seems to have the ability to inhabit the world of the play better than the rest rather.  He and Thompson, and a few others, say the words as if they were said by real people rather.  Robert Sean Leonard, for example, too often says the lines with a kind of preciousness that distracts from his character.  It seems as if he brings almost too much reverence for the words to believe a real person can say them.

In any case, the film is worth seeing because of Thomson's Beatrice and Briers' Leonato. If you want to see a light and frothy Shakespeare and don't mind a few, brief, bare backsides then this should be quite enjoyable.  As I said, it made me laugh pretty hard.",1130544000,2,2359,4.495305164319249

1799285,5,B0000714BZ,"`Much Ado About Nothing' directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh is a terrific adaptation of one of the most appropriately named of Shakespeare's plays. This comedy has the name that could easily be applied to practically half the romantic comedies in the history of the drama. And yet, as in all of Shakespeare's lighter plays, there is always an undercurrent of menace that threatens to sour the revelries. And, in spite of the fact that you know things will turn out all right, you can't help but feel some sense of peril, disgrace, and dishonor for several of the principle characters.

It is probably foolish for me to critique Shakespeare's writing, as he is not the greatest playwright in the history of drama in whatever language you may talk about. I only wish to note that like all his comedies, there are at least three intertwined threads to the plot set in a venue that is almost irrelevant to the plot. While the story takes place in Renaissance Tuscany, it could have as easily be set in any time or place where there is a hereditary nobility, from ancient Rome to 19th Century Russia.

The primary story line is with the love story involving the young Count Claudio and the only child Hero, daughter of the host and owner of the villa at which all the action takes place. Claudio is a vassal to Don Pedro, a prince, and his bastard brother, Don John, who is the villain who poisons the festivities out of resentment toward his recently being passed over for some honor in favor of Don Pedro.

The secondary story line is in the antipathy between Bernardo, another vassal to Don Pedro, and Beatrice, the older cousin to the young Hero. While the story of Claudio and Hero drives the primary action, most of the comedy develops out of the wordplay between Bernardo and Beatrice, reminding us of the relation between the principles in `The Taming of the Shrew'. The best scenes here are where Don Pedro and his co-conspirators contrive to change the antipathy between the two to love by dropping made up stories about the characters while the principles in this plot hide out of sight but within earshot.

The third story line revolves around the sergeant of the guard, Dogberry and his guardsmen who ultimately foil Don John's plot by overhearing Don John's henchmen gloat over their perfidious deceptions to make Don Pedro and Claudio believe Hero is a wonton harlot, not fit for marriage to a nobleman.

A glance at the cover shows a boatload of Hollywood stars that are not well known for their Shakespearean chops. While Branagh leads in the credits, the real star power, based on their current reputations, is held by Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, and Michael Keaton (although I suspect Keaton's reputation has actually fallen somewhat since the 1997 release of this film). Among these non-Shakespeareans, Washington and Keaton give terrific, albeit small performances in their roles at opposite ends of the social strata. Reeves is pretty much playing to type as a villain cast by birth, in Shakespeare's Renaissance world view, by his birth out of wedlock.

In addition to the stars, much of the heavy lifting is done by Richard Briers, who, I suspect is an English Shakespearean specialist (and BBC TV sitcom actor) plus the much missed Brian Blessed, one of the stars of the great series, `I, Claudius'.  The two young actors playing Claudio and Hero are totally eclipsed by Washington, Branagh, Thompson, Briers, and Reeves.

Leaving out the dark scenes in the second and third acts created by Don John's machinations, the movie is an unalloyed lovefest of cinematic festivities. The tone is set even before the initial credits roll when the arrival of Don Pedro and his lords from some undisclosed battle is announced at Briers' Tuscan villa. The arrival is played to the hilt with platoons of villa residents bathing and redressing in fresh cloths while the exuberant lords arrive by horse in a charge that would put a John Wayne cavalry flick to shame.

The movie ends with a similar revelry beautifully filmed from a great height, taking in much of the villa's beautifully manicured grounds. Taking my cue from Shakespeare's title, I have to assume that this is exactly the spirit he had in mind, without the benefit of modern cinematic effects. Of course, that means that Shakespeare had to create all his effects by writing what is unquestionably some of the best dialogue ever written. And, in general, this cast gives this dialogue good service.

While I was hooked on Shakespeare by a live performance of `The Merchant of Venice', this rendition of Shakespeare is an even better introduction. While some of the performances are just a bit underachieving, the overall effect is outstanding. The comic effects by Keaton and his comrades seem to have been borrowed from everyone from Monty Python (phony horse riding) to the Three Stooges (eye gouging and face slapping).

If you have no patience with Shakespearean verse, this performance may not change your mind, but if you are open to enjoying Shakespeare or are a fan already, this performance will please you.

There are very few extras, but then ephemera to a Shakespearean script would certainly be gilding a very precious lily.",1125705600,3,5235,4.869662921348315
1799286,4,B0000714BZ,"After receiving rave reviews for his remarkable movie adaptation of Henry V, Kenneth Branagh takes another stab at bringing Shakespeare to the screen. This time, he's chosen a comedy, and although this movie is neither as ambitious nor as searing as Branagh's first film, it still earns a place on the short list of excellent film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.

A proper ""Much Ado"" will always have a strong Benedick and Beatrice- the dueling couple who are at the centerpiece of the play. Branagh, and his then wife, Emma Thompson, fill these roles ably. Both their barbs and their vows are brilliantly exchanged with so much meaning and substance, so much humour and wit, that they dominate not only their own scenes, but that of the entire film (as they should). As such, it should come as no surprise that some of the other actors pale by comparison. However, on the whole, the entire cast gives a good performance, with only the exceptions of Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton (who admittedly tries his best in a thankless role.) And though some of the scenes are a little silly, and the film takes rather a long time to arrive at its inevitable conclusion, there is always the gorgeous Tuscan countryside, and Patrick Doyle's elegant score to remind you that this is truly a wonderful film.

If you are studying this play, I heartily recommend it, as you can do no wrong hearing Branagh, or Thompson for that matter, recite Shakespeare. But even if you have only a passing interest in Shakespeare, see this film- it just may convert you.",1125014400,,1548,4.772388059701493

Really have to admire Branagh for bring Shakespeare alive on film.  I have to wonder, though, whether he had some reservations about how well the movie would appeal to a modern, potentially youthful audience, and, with the sensational breast scene in the 1968 production of Romeo and Juliet in mind, threw in some partial nudity at the beginning (not to mention cladding the female characters in loose, low-cut and, at times, somewhat transparent costumes) to lessen the boredom.

1799307,1,B0000714BZ,"Much Ado About Nothing was a movie that, at first, did appeal to me, but had lost its fun plot and amusement as the story went on. The play itself, I'm sure, must be a very amusing story as a theatrical performance, but the movie has killed its purpose of Although it was another one of Shakespeare's original plays, and a comedy at that, the cast of actors chosen for this play were poorly chosen, the acting was over the top, and it just did not make me believe the story could be true.

The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were horrible. Even Denzel Washington, who I think is a great actor, and a remarkable person, is not the right kind of person to stoop so low as to doing this movie with other amateur actors. Also, I don't believe that in the Elizabethan times, they would have accepted an African American to perform in their plays, as they probably didn't even let women perform. I took the acting of Hero's new husband very offensively. He seriously killed the movie. He somewhat reminded me of that actor Orlando Bloom from the movie troy, he was a big sissy. Keanu Reeves, I'm just going to put it short, the worst acting of his career, he should be sent to prison for doing this movie.

The acting for this movie was very over the top. Some actors and actresses went to far in trying to act, that it just bothered me and made me want to go deaf and blind. I couldn't stand seeing modern people that are not in a black and white movie act so Elizabethan. The performance after the accusation of Hero's loss of virginity was a mess of a scene. Hero was crying like someone was killing her, and her accusers were yelling at the top of their lungs like they wanted to bite someone's head off. The whole movie was full of these kinds of things. Punishing sex is so clich in these kinds of old fashioned movies that it made me sick in my stomach and bored.

Overall this was a horrible, extremely boring movie. To be honest, even though I fell asleep during a large portion of this movie due to my boredom, it was still a waste of time as I woke up half an hour later. The movie was horrible, the play I bet is just as bad, though I don't want to blame Shakespeare for the mistakes that the producers and directors of this movie made. But it was still one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I give it two thumbs down.",1113955200,2,2343,4.237136465324385
1799308,5,B0000714BZ,"It's generally difficult to review a Shakespearean production.  Not only must you start from the premise that the production is a scaled-down version of a four-hour play, which is by definition a masterpiece, you must also place the production in the context of centuries of other such adaptations (""Is Derek Jacobi's version of ""Hamlet"" better than Olivier's?"").  All this baggage can make a review difficult - do you let the context of the production interfere with your review of its actual execution?

Other times it's easy, and Kenneth Branagh's film version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a sure-fire five star production from start to finish.  Branagh has set this tale of romance-and-nonsense in the definitive beautiful Tuscan villa and filled it with beautiful people (Emma Thompson is particularly radiant, and Denzel Washington virtually glows in his role as the Prince).  Romantic, rousing music dominates the soundtrack, and nary a cloud mars the picturesque Tuscan views.  A more perfect setting for a romantic comedy is hard to imagine.

It is also difficult to imagine a better cast for this film.  Ms. Thompson and Branagh are perfectly matched as wits who profess to abhore love and yet are irresistably drawn together.  Denzel Washington is surprisingly comfortable with the Shakespearean rhythms, as is the young Kate Beckinsale.  Branagh, of course, has his usual suspects in the cast as well, including Brian Blessed and Richard Briers, ensuring top-notch performances in supporting roles.  And Robert Sean Leanord fulfills the promise he showed in ""Dead Poets Society"" as a Shakespearean actor.

There are two polarizing performances in this movie.  One is Michael Keaton's Dogberry, the most laughable policeman ever to walk a Tuscan beat.  Keaton approaches Dogberry with the same zeal as he brought to Beetlejuice, and the combination of sincerity, madness, and idiocy he invests in Dogberry make all the malapropisms perfectly appropriate.  Sure, he chews some scenery, but that's how the character was written.

Even more polarizing is Keanu Reeves as Don John, the villain of the piece.  Many have criticized Reeves' performance as wooden (and worse), but I think it appropriate and well-measured.  Don John, by his own admission, is not a man of many words, and it is believable that his anger derives at being overshadowed by so many luminaries.  And since this is a comedy, Don John is not expected to rise to the heights of villainy obtained by Shakespeare's other creations, such as Iago.  Don John is supposed to be a mild threat to the order of things, an impediment to allow love to ultimately triumph, not a monster.  It's easy to pick on Mr. Reeves, but I'm more upset with him for the ""Matrix"" sequels than for his performance here.

A hugely entertaining clash of the sexes revolving around the trials and tribulations of young love conquering all, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" lives up to its title.  Far from Shakespeare's most serious work, he still manages to do more with it than most mortal writers could dare to dream.  A must for the film library!",1110153600,3,3093,5.055226824457594
1799309,5,B0000714BZ,"+++++

Shakespeare's romantic comedy of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (written circa 1598) is best known for its brilliant lovers, the dazzling Beatrice and Benedick. The play itself resembles the screwball comedies of the 1930s and is filled with merriment and
mirth.

Director Kenneth Branagh's movie of the same name captures all of this.  He has changed and embellished some scenes but retains Shakespeare's beautiful language as originally written.

There are eight major characters in this movie (as there are in the original play):

1. Don Pedro (Denzel Washington), the genial Prince of Arragon.
2. Don John (Keanu Reeves), his uncommunicative half brother who was born out of wedlock.  His presence functions as a contrast to the festive mood of most of the movie.
3. Leonato (Richard Briers), ""the white bearded fellow,"" Governor of Messina.
4. Claudio (Robert S. Leonard), ""a proper squire"" of Florence, ""Monsieur Love,"" possessed of the ""May of youth and bloom of lustihood.""
5. Hero (Kate Beckinsale), ""Leonato's short daughter,"" the somewhat colorless foil to Beatrice.
6. Benedick (Branagh), the mirthful young lord of Padura, ""of a noble strain, of approved value, and confirmed honesty,"" but an unsentimental woman-hater; foil to Claudio.  ""He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bowstring, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.""
7. Beatrice (Emma Thompson), niece of Leonato, a ""Lady Tongue,"" but one who on occasion ""speaks [daggers] and every word stabs.""  She is ""born to speak all mirth and no matter.""  As well, she wages a ""merry war"" with Benedick.
8. Dogberry (Michael Keaton), a pompous, humorous, ridiculous constable of Messina, ""one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him.""  He can be thought of as an Elizabethan Keystone Kop who, by accident, brings the villains of this movie to justice.

All the above actors do a good job in their roles.  However, Branagh and Thompson do exceptional acting jobs as the bickering lovers who throughout the movie exchange insults when it's obvious to everyone but themselves that they are drawn to each other.  Special mention should also be given to Michael Keaton as Dogberry, who does a good job in bringing Shakespeare's first great comic creation to life.  As well, Denzel Washington does a surprisingly good job as the prince, Don Pedro.

The opening bathhouse scene of this movie is spectacular.  The energy apparent in this scene is held throughout the movie.

The scenery and sets are visually stunning.  (Filming was at an Italian villa in Tuscany, Italy.)  As well, the background music adds to each scene.

Finally, the only main extra is a seven minute making-of featurette.  It seems to be just a glorified trailer.  There is no need to purchase this DVD if you already have a copy of this movie on DVD without the featurette.

BOTTOM LINE:

This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic cannon.

1799310,4,B0000714BZ,"This movie offers a relatively true rendering of the Shakespearean classic ""Much Ado about Nothing"" and boasts a robust and generally speaking talented cast able, ultimately, to fill each of their respective roles.  Michael Keaton offers particular sparkle while proving his vein for comic turns once again; Robert Sean Leonard as Claudio and Kate Beckinsale as Hero contour their roles with that grace which looks so comely on Shakespeare's young-lover characters.

However, one Achilles heel that invariably gets impedes one's being able to accept and get lost in this Elizabethan romantic comedy is Keanu Reeves' impenetrable and very northwestern accent which hinders him from credibly embodying the resentful envy of Don John.  Beautiful as he irrefutably looks in this part, the second he opens his mouth, we are - as we so often are with Reeves' period films -  transported back to the 20th century and reminded of plasticene accents in high-school productions of yore.

1799312,5,B0000714BZ,"Acclaimed writer, director and actor Kenneth Branagh follows up his mainstream sophomore film ""Dead Again"" with a second adaptation of one of William Shakespeare's plays, and this time, it is a comedy. As with his debut film
""Henry V"" and his 2nd movie ""Dead Again,"" Branagh assembles an all-star cast, and it works very well. I won't rehash the plot, as it is well known, but it appears that ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" Academy Award winners Emma Thompson & Dwenzel Washington, Kate Beckinsale, Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton round out the main cast, in addition to Branagh (who as usual, doubles as star, writer, producer and director). My favourite scene is the one where Benedick is in the garden. I won't say more, for fear of spoiling it, but I will say that it's funny. Most reviewers have criticized Keanu Reeves as being a stiff, but I think he does well in what is a minor role (same as in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""; the part of Jonathan Harker is minor, but he did very well in it). Branagh's casting choices have always proven to be a success, and they've worked wonders, especially for his 1996 full-text version of ""William Shakespeare's Hamlet."" My only gripe is that Robert Sean Leonard (who plays Claudio) can't cry to save his life. In the pivotal scenes where he was supposed to cry, no tears were visible. Either onions should have been put under his eyes to make him cry or another actor should have been cast. Kate Beckinsale, a relative unknown at the time, can cry and she's proven to be a versatile actress. I highly recommend this film, as it's lite-Branagh. But the majority of Branagh's films are excellent (and I recommend all of them, with the exception of ""Sleuth,"" of which the first half was sharp and witty, but the 2nd half was just so...weird).

1799328,5,B0000714BZ,"Kenneth Branagh is, undoubtedly, my favorite Shakespeare actor and director. He casts based on talent rather than popularity and his choices really pay off. His own roles are instilled with a vibrant energy and life not often seen in film.
This screen adaptation of Shakespeare's romantic comedy takes us on a light-hearted adventure of match-making and deceit. Branagh plays Benedick, a soldier in the company of Don Pedro of Aragon and a ""professed tyrant"" to the female sex who swears he will die a bachelor. Emma Thompson, then Branagh's wife, plays Beatrice, a free-spirited female version of Benedick. The two are engaged in a ""merry war"" of wits, and constantly offend one another. Their friends, however, see them as the perfect couple and endeavour to bring them together against their own wills.
The second love story is that of Claudio, another favored soldier of prince Don Pedro, played by Robert Sean Leonard, and Hero, a career-starting role for actress Kate Beckinsale. Theirs is a case of love at first sight, and they soon become engaged to be married. Don John, the prince's outcast brother, however, will do anything to destroy the happiness of one of Don Pedro's favored men. He and his henchmen enter into a plot to break up the engagement.
Don Pedro is played by Denzel Washington, and the role highlights his amazing versatility and talent as an actor. This is definitely one of his best performances. It is also refreshing to see a movie where the good brother is played by a person of color and the bad brother, Don John (Keanu Reeves) is white. Branagh made an excellent casting choice and both characters shine.
Comic relief is provided by an outstanding performance of Michael Keaton as Dogberry, the local sheriff who's more than a little off his rocker, but harmlessly entertaining. Delightful performances are also given by Richard Briers as Leonato, Brian Blessed as Antonio, and Richard Clifford as Conrade.
With great acting, verbal and physical comedy, and a wonderful musical score, this film is a definite must-see for any fan of Shakespeare and Kenneth Branagh. A truly delightful movie!",1070064000,7,2126,5.008474576271187
1799329,5,B0000714BZ,"I think I'm yet to see a film by Branagh that I haven't enjoyed, and his interpretation of Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is no exception.  His cast is excellent, from Michael Keaton to Denzel Washington, and I really enjoyed the interaction between the characters and the way they brought life to the work.  However, my favorite performances belonged to Kenneth Branagh as Benedick and Emma Thompson as Beatrice.  They were absolutely hilarious, and yet very sad.  Beatrice especially seemed to fall into this category; while she was talking to others, she was very witty and humorous, but as soon as she fell out of the limelight and muttered under her breath or said something quietly, you realized that she wasn't all that happy.  The idea that she used to be in a relationship with Benedick was particularly obvious in her performance, though I didn't even notice it while reading the play.  In the film, Beatrice would follow up her wittiness with a longing or wistful expression and a solemn sentence, and after being directly insulted by Benedick during the festival, she seems to become very sad and reflective.
As a contrast, I don't really see this in Benedick at all.  He never seems sad, just angry at his kinsman Claudio becoming married.  Rather than mourning this fact, he simply becomes resentful and angry.  This seems to add some clarity to what happened in the relationship between Benedick and Beatrice.  While a little bit of humanity is shown through his character when he questions why Beatrice would ever love him, Benedick seems to be more than anything a simple and unfeeling character until his circumstances force him to grow up and make a decision (to challenge Claudio).  However, even this decision isn't an original thought or something he wanted to do, so even in this he seems a little childish - he's just following the wishes of someone else.
 Benedick seems to reflect many negative male stereotypes in that he doesn't really listen, he doesn't care about the feelings of others, and ultimately his actions are more for his benefit than anyone else.  He struggles for power and even in the final marriage sequence; he proves that he's in control of the relationship when he decides to kiss Beatrice.  Despite all these follies, he's still my favorite character in the film and play and I think that he, more than anyone, makes the play humorous and entertaining.  This is just another way in which his character contrasts with that of Beatrice.  Beatrice seems to reflect all the positive characteristics of a strong woman while Benedick reflects many negative stereotypes of an immature man.
These differences in characters, especially when involved in a romance, make ""Much Ado About Nothing"" a very compelling and entertaining story.  The joking keeps the play funny and entertaining, while the subplots complement the humor by adding substance and seriousness.",1069372800,3,2910,4.991718426501035

Furthermore, there is no one star of the show (perhaps two, if Benedict and Beatrice are counted as the leads), so you don't get as sick of Brannaugh as you usually do in his mind-numbing epics (i.e. Hamlet - wherein near the end you feel like screaming, ""There's a knife right there!

1799343,5,B0000714BZ,"I can add very little to the other reviews that laud this wonderful adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"".  I would merely like to take the opportunity to say that there are moments in this film which STILL bring a tear to my eye, simply because they are so incredibly beautifully done.  For all the years I have studied and read Shakespeare's works, I have never seen a production that makes you forget you are hearing a ""foreign"" language, so clear is the meaning  and emotion of the players in this film.

From the moment the men come galloping over the hill to the rousing theme tune, through every quip, quibble and heart wrenching moment, time stops for me and I'm absorbed into this Tuscan world. A movie I can see over and over and never tire of it. Kenneth Branagh, yet again, does a magnificent job of modernising this classic story yet keeping it true to the Shakespearean roots.",1058054400,,418,4.586666666666667
1799345,5,B0000714BZ,"All right, I admit it.  I think Kenneth Branagh is brilliant as an actor and a director.  (I'm ignoring that whole ""Wild, Wild West"" thing.  I'm not sure who's to blame for that.)
He built a reputation for his ability to bring Shakespeare to the screen with unparalleled accesibility.  Together with his then-wife Emma Thompson, a continuing company of actors and artisans, and a hand-full of big 'Hollywood' actors, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" may be the best of Branagh's Shakespeare films.
Granted, when Shakespeare doesn't do tragedy, the plots sometimes border on sit-com.  The old 'Three's Company' joke applies.  'Oh, is this the episode with the misunderstanding?'  This is one of those.  But if you go into it with a light attitude, it rewards.
In this film, the performers deliver Shakespeare's lines as if it's modern language.  Clear and covincing, amoungst beautiful scenery and costumes.  It's great fun, and I was so pleased when they recently reissued it on DVD.",1056412800,4,975,5.0375
1799346,5,B0000714BZ,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a beautifully made, performed, and directed film by the incomparable Kenneth Branaugh. This film includes an all-star cast that give wonderful performances and draw you into the lives of the characters. The plot is somewhat complicated, so I'll give a general version. The film is basically about love, misunderstanding, scandal, revenge, virtue, and bravery. That's a lot for one film, but believe me, it's all in there!
Kenneth Branaugh, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton give excellent performances in this film that you wouldn't want to miss. Although the film is a period piece and the Shakespearean language is used, you will have no difficulty understanding it perfectly.
The scenery and landscape in this film are exquisite as well. I never thought there could be such a beautiful, untouched place like that on earth. I would suggest watching the film just for the beautiful landscape, but it's the performances and the story that you should really pay attention to.
Anyone who loves Shakespeare would absolutely love this film! Anyone who loves Kenneth Branaugh and what he has done for Shakespeare in the past 10 or 15 years will appreciate this film as well! There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. Definitely watch it, you won't be disappointed!!!",1052870400,6,1333,5.091324200913242
1799347,5,B0000714BZ,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of those sparkling adaptations that supposedly couldn't have been done. But Kennneth Branagh (director and star of ""Hamlet,"" and creator of the supremely underrated ""Midwinter's Tale"") brought an all-star cast in a sparkling Tuscan setting, to bring this tale of bickering loves and sordid betrayals to life as never before.
The sullen Don John has just been stopped in a rebellion against his brother Don Pedro, by young hero Claudio. Now all of them (including Don John, whom his brother has forgiven) are arriving in Messina, the home of kindly Leonato. But when they get there, Claudio immediately falls in love with Leonato's beautiful daughter Hero. And despite the efforts of Don John, Don Pedro manages to get the two young lovers together and altar-bound.
But Don Pedro isn't willing to stop there. Hero's cousin Beatrice has a long-running feud with Claudio's pal Benedick -- they insult each other, they bicker, they argue about everything (""It is so indeed -- he is no less than a stuffed man!""). What's more, both of them swear to stay single forever. (""All women shall pardon me -- I shall live a bachelor!"") Pedro and the others conspire to get Benedick and Beatrice to somehow fall in love with each other. And at first it seems that everything is going well -- until Don John manages to cast doubt on Hero's honor
There's a certain timeless quality to ""Much Ado"" -- not just the dialogue, but the simple costumes and the buildings in it. That leaves the audience free to pay more attention to the dialogue and its plot. And what a plot it is! ""Much Ado"" is brimming over with funny dialogue, dastardly plots, comedic supporting characters and weird pairings. (Beatrice and Benedick are the sort of love-hate couple that a lot of movies try to have, but don't succeed with)
The dialogue is mostly (if not all) Shakespeare's own, but it's not necessary to be a Shakespeare buff to understand what they're saying. It's not dumbed down, either -- it's just spoken as normally as ordinary English. And the Tuscan landscape sparkles with life, passion, and lots of fruit and wine. You don't need to be a fan already to understand and appreciate this movie.
Kenneth Branagh (who also directed and adapted the play) is amazing as Benedick, lovably witty and egotistical; he gets a little silly at times (such as his bird calls or joyous romp in the fountain), but demonstrates his serious ability after Hero is disgraced. the outstanding Emma Thompson is even better as the sharp-tongued Beatrice, a fiery young woman with her own mind and definitely her own mouth. Thompson lashes out Shakespeare's witty lines as easily as if she just thought them up herself; one of her most powerful scenes is here. Denzel Washington (Don Pedro) looks like he's having a great time; Keanu Reeves (Don John) is a bit flat in places, but glowers well enough. Kate Beckinsale's first movie role (Hero) is suitably sweet and adorable. Robert Sean Leonard (Claudio) is the one weak link in the cast; he seems a bit too overwrought and hysterical to be a major hero. (No pun intended)
This movie was unavailable for a very long time and only recently was rereleased on DVD. The DVD is pretty spare; aside from the movie, there are a few DVD promos (for ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""The Princess Bride"" -- both, I notice, comedic romances) and a brief making-of featurette. The featurette doesn't really offer much that is new, but does give some insights into the chosen settings and why the cast wished to do the movie.
Those who enjoyed Branagh's ""Hamlet"" and ""Henry V"" will rejoice in ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" the quintessential romantic comedy. Funny, sweet, romantic, and incredibly well-acted, this is a keeper.",1050796800,90,3739,4.825545171339564
1799348,4,B0000714BZ,"William Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is brought to life with elegance and grace. Aside from the nudity and [adult] content, this is a great film full of funny humor, a great cast and brilliant filmmaking (Credit for that goes to Kenneth Branagh, who has proven time and again that he is as fine a director as Spielberg, Lucas, and Scorcese, if not better). The second DVD release features a fine digital transfer of the film, complete in it's 1.85:1 Widescreen format.  The short featurette ""Making 'Much Ado'"" is not the best doc ever made, but it does it's job. Other special features include the Theatrical trailer and trailers for the ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and ""The Princess Bride"" DVD's. A fine addition to the collection.

1799350,5,B0000714BZ,"Branagh again shows his brilliance as the premier Shakespearean adaptation director of our time. He uses an imaginative cast and some dreamily beautiful scenery and music to create a movie that is light hearted, funny and escapist (which is a good thing is these dark times). Denzel is wonderful as the lovingly charming and self-assured Prince Don Pedro. Quite frankly I never suspected he could do Shakespeare so easily and sexily.
Branagh is not quite as good an actor as he is directing, but his witty and quick tempered Benedick has the right contrast of insecurity and aplomb. In my book though, he will never top his portrayal of Henry V.  I've always had a huge crush on Emma Thompson and her performance here is nothing short of amazing; direct, passionate (I loved the teary scene after Hero's unwarranted disgrace, funny and wishful. I hardly know Robert Sean Leonard but I thought his naive and boyish portrayal of Claudio was quite appropriate to the role. He didn't steal scenes from Washington or Branagh but I think he was true to the play. Despite what many would say, I was pleasantly surprised by Keanu Reeves as the evil plotting Don John. He definitely looked the roguish part and his delivery is meant to show the limitations of the character (not that of the actor) as Shakespeare wrote the role.  My only disappontment was that of Michael Keaton as the Constable Dogberry. I didn't appreciate his attempt at Beetlejuice humor and I thought a Geoffery Rush here would have done much better justice to this humorous and juicy role. Moreover, he kept jumbling his words so I could hardly understand what he was saying.  The rest of the supporting cast were quite good especially Kate Beckinsale (Hero). This movie and it's DVD version is a must see classic for all Shakespeare fans.",1048550400,14,1803,4.809677419354839

Not only do I understand it now, but I fully apreciate how good it is.
The movie is a very good adaptation of the play. The impressive lines that Shakespeare wrote were generally given new life in their delivery. Also, I must compliment Michael Keaton on his role. It isn't a very big one, but if you watch this movie, you'll understand why I mentioned it. Overall, this is simply a fully enjoyable movie, whether you're a fan of Shakespeare or not.",1047945600,,676,4.373015873015873
1799362,5,B0000714BZ,"This is one of my favorite Shakespeare movies. The performances were delivered so originally and the plot was so much like other movies that I thought for a while that this movie was not an adaptation of a Shakespeare play but an original brainchild of Kenneth Branagh, who was amazing and hilarious as Benedick. I have not read the entire play of Much Ado About Nothing but I could understand everything that was going on. Keanu Reeves played Don John like a real movie villain. I don't know who the plot revolves around. Is it about Hero and Claudio, Beatrice and Benedick, or both couples? Emma Thompson was also very funny as Beatrice. Is it just me or have Richard Briers (who plays Leonato) and Brian Blessed (who plays Antonio) been in almost every Shakespeare adaptation done by Kenneth Branagh. Kenneth Branagh really knows how to bring Shakespeare to the screen. I was sad that the girl who played Hero didn't have a lot of dialogue. Michael Keaton played Dogberry very nicely. I loved hearing his Beetlejuice voice again. I had no idea that Denzel Washington could do Shakespeare. He was so amazing as Don Pedro. A friend of mine thinks he should play Othello. I agree.

You will fall in love with Shakespeare's wittiest pair, Beatrice (Emma Thompson) and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh), while admiring the absolutely gorgeous landscape of the set.  Each character's unique portrayal adds to the lighthearted feel of the movie; Shakespeare's diction is handled so well that the blank verse is remarkably stimulating...even to those who usually find it detrimental.

1799365,5,B0000714BZ,"What a brilliant cast, what brilliant camera-work, what a delight for the eyes, and what music to the ears!
Keaton is a little creepy to my taste, but he is generally entertaining for all that.  Robert Sean Leonard does a terrific, boyish Claudio ... the thoroughly sleazy Keanu Reeves plays upon him with an ease which is painful to witness.  This appearance by Denzel Washington demonstrates his worthiness to receive an Oscar, only I wish that award had been for this role rather than Just Another Cop Movie;  the cast all together work miraculously well together, you almost feel Shakespeare wrote this play in the nineties, with this cast in mind.  Branagh and Thompson are terrific as ever ... they must have been uncomfortably like Beatrice and Benedick in real life, two great talents too sharp to fit one another peaceably ... but this is one of the documents which make you wish they could have continued a lifelong partnership.  To see this, is to regret that Thompson fell into a period of prolonged dowdiness in such things as ""Carrington"" and ""Howard's End"" (both beautifully filmed, but both rather tawdry stories ... part of their power, I suppose, being the dissonance between their visual beauty, and how ""soiled"" the stories make the viewer feel).
Shakespeare is too great that any one production might claim to own him, but this movie is a model of perfection ... you nearly feel that no one else may have any right to Much Ado.",1045526400,3,1448,4.776

The seemingly difficult language of Shakespeare is spoken with such ease and natural human emotion that it translates into simple communication to the common viewer.

I can't tell you if Director/Actor, Kenneth Branagh has stayed true to the Bard's original text or themes. What I can tell you is that Branagh's version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a light and enjoyable film that makes me smile, laugh and even sigh. The title pretty much says it all about the plot. There are two sets of couples who are in love. One couple (Claudio & Hero) has their love threatened by the nasty meddlings of others (more percisely the evil, Don John).The other couple (the battling Benedick & Beatrice)are brought together through the trickery of others, but their love is more threatened by their own personalties and neuroses (shades of Woody Allen!).Branagh's version of this simple plot is delightful. The actors for the most part show a good deal of chemistry together. This is especially true for Branagh and Actress, Emma Thompson (who eventually married and divorced in real life). Their fighting Benedick & Beatrice really hit a note of perfection. The play's hilarious insults easily flow from the lips of these two wonderful actors. Denzel Washington also does a fine job, as his sparkling personality comes out, in the role of the domineering, yet friendly Don Pedro. I know it's not to everyone's taste, but I cracked up at Michael Keaton's bizarre take on Constable Dogberry. It's rather interesting to see Beetlejuice doing Shakespeare with a touch of Monty Python thrown in. The only false note of the production is Keanu Reeves as the villainous, Don John. Why do producers and directors continue to put this guy in their movies? He has to be the most wooden actor in the universe! The film is also very beautiful to look at. It puts to good use it's Italian countryside locations and sets. The same can be said for the costumes (especially the masks worn in the party scenes).The DVD to this film has a good clear picture. The extras were a bit on the skimpy side with one very short 'making of feature' and a trailer. I highly recommend watching this movie with the DVD player's subtitle feature in the 'on' position to follow the wonderful text.
