4261381,5,B0044LYRMI,"I recently had the opportunity to review the WordWorld DVD Get Up and Move. There were four 15 minute episodes on the DVD and while my son had already seen three of those four, it didn't stop him from watching it twice - in a row! I definitely recommend buying this DVD for your child. If we didn't have netflix we would probably be buying all of the DVDs for our son. It gives him a head start on learning letters, animals and other objects and it helps our daughter with spelling and reading.

*I received a free copy of the WordWorld Get Up and Move DVD in exchange for my honest review. I was able to do this through the SheBlogs Network and was not financially compensated by SheBlogs, WordWorld or it's affiliates.",1302048000,6,720,4.373134328358209

4261385,5,B0044LYRMI,I needed something to keep my spirited 3 year old seated for a few minutes and this works. He loves the dog and duck. He will sit and watch the entire thing (which says a lot). This makes learning fun for him.,1399507200,,209,4.0
4261386,3,B0044LYRMI,I thought it'd be more musical.. the cover isn't the greatest for this. It does have a part my 2 year old loves where its a train and they do the abcs but the rest bores her.,1389484800,,174,3.72972972972973

4261390,5,B0044LYRMI,"This is an amazing series for a kiddo who loves word world. we have all dvds and
it took us time to collect them, this is great opportunity to save time and money.
The best way to encourage a child to learn is to buy the words world animals just
like the ones in dvd. I highly recommend the famous Word World pull apart plush plush soft animals to go with it.
The babies and kids love them so much. You can't get them anymore at stores
but if you are lucky you can come across the set on e bay.
It is worth all the money as it helps a child to learn so fast so early so much.
It is also amazing how much they sell for even used ones so it is good investment.
Well worth the price.",1325808000,,680,3.8297872340425534
4261391,5,B0044LYRMI,"This collection of wordworld is perfect and best of all are pull apart animals soft and cuddly made of leters.
It is just amazing how quickly my baby learned letter recognition and puting words together in order thanks to these animals.
The whole family was amazed how those little hands could put togehter the dog, cat, zebra, cow, etc.. all animals in the set
together in a snap.

We started with the dog as it is her faforite animal, obviously - like most kids :) and then we gradually were adding on
animals untill we ended up with the whole set before we knew it. It is so rewording to see your tinny treasure to
be able to do words!!! that it is jsut breath taking.

We did not need any foring techinques, flash cards or anything, she was just grasping the concept from my taking apart
the animal, sounding the letters and puting them together back for her few times and then she got it like
in the same day and from that day on she knew.

I think this should be every paretnt's every baby first educational toy. It is so baby friendly, perfect for the sens of touch,
soft and cozy - what actually is said to develop brain faster.
It is sucha pleasing design and there are places to chew on if you need ha ha ha..
We take the animals everyhwere we go and she does not only have fun she is reinforcing her reading skills and preparing
for future writing without knowing it!

We were lucky to get the animals that were issued in those white boxed packaging with DVD inside. Not the other version in
the orangy cheaper packaging and without DVD. Difference is really apparent. I got the animals as a gift to my niece
but I could not find anywhere the first edition in white packaging with bluish background and DVd included in the box
so Igot the other set on e by and apparently they are not the same. Similar and all but the quality is not the same.
The original edition animals are more plumpy, solid, and have better and more baby friendly feel and touch to them
whereas the other - not the white box- edition has cheaper feel to it.

Overall we are very very pleased with the set. I have heard that this design got so many rewards and it is so popular among parents
and I totally agree with the notion. It is great for the baby and it teaches something useful for life unlike so many toys
that do nothing. It is good to see your baby having so much fun and stay engaged for good while with them.
It is amazing how long attention span the baby has while playing with the animals.

As she grows I marvel how she can put together the simple words from different animals for fun.. as in she would take
different letters from different animals and still spell the word dog or cat or cow correctly and giggles
that each letters is from different animal.. like for instance she will take L from the lion with the head,
then put i from the fish and then o from the dog and n from the lion again and she is so proud to do that.
It shows me that she is not only putting animal together, she is actually aware of the letters..
and to prove it she can take just the letters without heads and not color coded and at random
pull the letters and put together a word that is independent of characters..

soooooo cooooooooool

I am shopping for the original set now to get it for Christmas for two beloved babies in the family
and they are so hard to find, yet I won't stop till I find them. This is THE gift of learning and
I wont' settle for less :)",1324080000,,3442,4.228310502283105
