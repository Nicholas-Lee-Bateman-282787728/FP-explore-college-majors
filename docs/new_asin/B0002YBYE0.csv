8657669,5,B0002YBYE0,"I wish I had seen this earlier. My father succumbed to Alzheimer's (and other ailments) last year and none of our family - even those who saw him daily - picked up on the now obvious signs of Dementia. And when it hit, we were strugling to cope, day by day. But once we all viewed this program - it all started to make sense and we were able to ensure that we could all cope much better with the roller coaster ride ahead of us.

The DVD (I think it's on VHS too) was divided into 4 sections. Continuing a familiar lifestyle, Making the most of abilities, Relating and communicating and Strange/disruptive behaviour.

We really appreciated Section 1 and 3 and the way that all the major issues were shown - and for both carers and professionals a little understanding went such a long way. I have read so much about this disease in the papers etc, but this DVD just puts it all in a nushell and made a difficult situation so much better for us all.",1109462400,7,948,4.290502793296089
