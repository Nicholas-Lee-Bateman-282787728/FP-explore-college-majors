6253791,3,B00I87XNOW,"This compilation was released before as Girls, Guns and G-Strings. As far as I can tell, there's no difference.

Each movie features the same Andy Sidaris blend of action, spy movie spoof, and usually some Playmate or Pet du jour. To be fair, if you grew up during the 80's and early 90's, you'll recognize many of these ladies. Probably the most talented is Julie Strain, who was (I believe) a Penthouse Pet of the Year. She has a real gift for camp and kitsch. Other notables include Suzi Simpson, Tai Collins, Dona Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Wendy Hamilton, Kimberley MacArthur, and Cynthia Brimhall. You'll notice familiar faces such as Erik Estrada and Pat Morita, but, let's face it, they're just here to pick up a paycheck and very few of Sidaris's male viewers are interested to see them, anyway.

A big problem in many of the movies is that Sidaris forgets that he's making action/comedy movies and instead sees himself as the next Steven Spielberg or Tony Scott. Sidaris now and then does take himself seriously and, when he does, that's his biggest downfall.

Probably the most entertaining movies are Savage Beach and Enemy Gold. Both movies feature story lines about hidden gold or treasure. Savage Beach is the better made movie of the two.  The movie carries an anti-war message. It's the only example in which Sidaris takes himself seriously and it works. Exotic locations and very pretty photography add to the appeal. Finally, though Sidaris makes the movie with the male viewer in mind, the tone is so light that I think a male-female couple could watch it together without anyone feeling uncomfortable.

Enemy Gold is not on the same level as Savage Beach, but it's enjoyable and features one of Julie Strain's signature roles--an evil agent named Jewell Panther. She's having great hammy fun in every scene. Suzi Simpson and Tai Collins are successful in their parts, too.

The transfer quality on all of the movies in this compilation is lousy--lots of pixels and artifacts. They look especially bad on a widescreen panel.

I can't really recommend this to anybody unless you're an 80's kid looking to reclaim a little bit of your lost youth. The compilation usually retails for $5 at mass-market retailers, which is a fair price but no bargain.",1440028800,5,2267,4.857512953367876

8639803,5,B00I87XNOW,It was everything that I hoped it to be; the picture quality is great; color quality great; of course the playmates were out standing. I considered the Sidaris films the best in it's genre; action adventure; with the playmates in the leading rolls; kind of' like Charlie's Angels; but really better.

8639810,3,B00I87XNOW,"As another reviewer mentioned,.. and I should have read,.. there are two different SKUs, that look different, with different covers, yet both have the same title list.

There is this one,.. and then there is ""Girls, Guns and G-Strings"".

Be careful not to buy both of them and get stuck with them because you didn't notice.",1460505600,9,323,4.75
