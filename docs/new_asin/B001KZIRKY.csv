3674760,5,B001KZIRKY,"As a history buff, I was complelled to see this film from the get go. The fact that critics were particularly brutal led me to believe this was indeed an excellent film. I was very pleased to see it stuck to the facts even if some of the details are rather mundane. The cinematography does an excellent job at placing you in the era as if you were a bystander to the events before you.
The acting was simply top notch. Tom Cuise elevated himself with his performance. He was quite believable and true to the accounts of Colonel Stauffenberg. I reject the accounts by critics that this was a Gerry Maguire performance in uniform. The supporting cast is award worthy. it is rare to find a cast that works so seemlessly together. I believe the director deserves particular credit for this achievement.
Bottom line, Valkyrie is a top quality film worthy of your time. Forget what all those bitter, envious critics says, see it for yourself and then judge the film in it's merits.",1232668800,116,975,4.577142857142857
3674761,5,B001KZIRKY,"All Historical Dramas faithful to the actual events run the risk of being dry and boring.  Fortunately, although it is a bit dry here and there, the producers of Valkyrie didn't stray too far in that direction.  The story is well-told, and I did not feel that it dragged or got into excessive and boring detail at any point.  If you are a student of WWII, and particularly this famous failed attempt to assassinate Hitler, you will be pleased with the quality of the film, the acting, and the film's faithfulness to facts and to the tone of the times.  The film brings forth many details of which I was not aware, and the historical facts I know-of from past research are accurately portrayed.

It is clear computer graphics are used extensively in this film, since many of the scenes could not have been filmed in any other way, more than 60 years after events took place.  The special effects are for the most part well done, and are not intrusive - clearly used only as needed to support the story instead of being an excuse to show-off a studio's CGI capabilities.

As for acting, this story was an excellent vehicle for Tom Cruise.  I feel Cruise's portrayal of Colonel von Stauffenburg, who was a central figure in the assassination plot and this story, was excellent and believable.  Some may argue that the characterization is a bit wooden, but I suspect this may be intentional on Cruise's part, and in keeping with the historical figure: a decorated soldier filled with anger towards Hitler, who could survive in the upper levels of the German Army only by masking his true feelings.

The rest of the cast is phenomenal. I was amazed at the number of familiar and respected actors and actresses that appeared in relatively minor roles throughout the film.  Not a single performance was less than I would expect from such a cast.

The film is not a light-hearted one, nor does it end well for most of the characters.  There are several bloody scenes, but none of the violence is gratuitous.  As such, this is a film that will be appreciated primarily by those interested in the history of WWII, or are solid Tom Cruise fans.  I am well pleased with the film as a whole, and feel the end product meets the goals of both the producers and their intended audience.  I'll give it Five Stars.",1232323200,144,2296,4.590686274509804

3674829,2,B001KZIRKY,"It's awesome watching SS and high ranking Germans speak with American and British accents. How convincing. Nice sets and settings, but miscast with Cruise who sticks out like a sore thumb in this production of a Jack-booted Jack Ryan set during WWII,

There is no identifying with any of the characters here, especially the lead Cruise, who (along with others) can't manage the voice lessons to at least speak with a German accent. The story plays out like someone had a script checklist on a clipboard and dutifully marked each one off.

Sadly, movie studios, and their distributors obviously hire people to praise this movie in order to milk a few last nickels out of it. These people are paid liars and thieves.

It's not a awful movie, per se. It just isn't very good and is on the boring side. The story as presented plods along boringly when such a subject should be.gripping.

3674871,3,B001KZIRKY,"The problem with this film is that it takes Tom Cruise and attempts to build around his weaknesses. The role is outside his range. All of the co-stars and supporting cast seem to be weakened so Cruise appears stronger. The character, his conspirators and enemies are implausible because everyone is compensating for the miscast Cruise. He is not really an action hero. He is always Tom Cruise. Because of this he should avoid historical figures and stick with roles that allow for Tom to be Tom. He is good in a wide range of roles so long as they can conform to Tom Cruise the star. Tom Cruise is not a chameleon actor. He is always Tom Cruise in a certain environment and situation.",1503532800,,684,4.524193548387097

3674875,5,B001KZIRKY,"Excellent film account of the last attempt to kill Hitler. I've read of the reports before, and have seen some accounts of the attempts in films dealing with other aspects of WWII. This film is as accurate as is possible. There are some aspects which are not as they occurred in real life, at least according to many articles and comments and historical accounts of the entire plot. However, that is not terribly important as this film shows how brave the many men and women were in wishing to rid the world of a madman. In many respects, the chaos which ensued on that day in July of 1944, actually led to the Nazi regime unravelling bit by bit from within due to very irrational decisions of how to end the war with no chance of winning. The Nazis were hell-bent on winning or taking everyone down with them. Unfortunately, they chose the latter and many more innocent lives were lost with increased Allied bombing, the ever-advancing Allied armies on all fronts, and the complete destruction of the navy which was so much a part of Hitler's plan to conquer the world.

It is sad to know about how the current German govt. wished to not have Tom Cruise play a central part in this film. Their insistence to reject Scientology and claim it to be a cult is admirable and I don't disagree with them, but when all is said and done, Tom Cruise did a remarkable job in his role, as he is quite a fine actor and took this role very seriously to the point where I believe it may be his best effort. I have no argument with either side on this issue and look at the film as a very good account of how Germany tried to rid the world of the worst madman in recorded history.

It is quite a testament to von Stauffenberg that he is still honored to this day. He was a remarkable man who sacrificed his life for an incredibly important cause. It failed due to hesitations and minor mistakes which snow-balled very quickly as Hitler was not assassinated. von Stauffenberg was a hero if anyone can ever be called such. His family lived through the rest of the war and went on to live very normal lives, if that is possible for the relatives of a very principled man who died trying to save the world from Hitler's holocaust which ended 9 months later.

Lots of people wonder what would have occurred if von Stauffenberg and his cohorts had been successful. That's not what occurred, and to guess is quite silly, but we know for sure that many tens or hundreds of thousands of people would not have lost their lives, from the quest of the Nazis to fight to the last man. All else is speculation.",1502755200,,2581,4.395397489539749
3674876,4,B001KZIRKY,"This is an elaborate and involving cinematic production featuring one of my favorite actors, Tom Cruise. As always he gave a great performance in his portrayal as the leader in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. I have always enjoyed watching Tom Cruise because he is a very intense, believable, and talented professional. There was much action and suspense in this film as the intricacies of the assassination attempt are played out and the roles of each character in this attempt are revealed. This movie has an enormous cast with elaborate war scenes and perilous situations faced by the characters. The family element of the movie was a bit weak but I guess is necessary giving a more ""human"" touch with the soldiers.  The film also had good portrayal of emotions of the characters through their facial expressions and dialogue. With that said the sound and sound quality was bad. As I was watching the movie the sound was breaking up and in many scenes the actors were whispering or speaking so softly it was hard to understand some of the dialogue even if I turned up the volume. The background music also had a choppy sound quality at times which was quite annoying. But aside from these technical issues, this is a movie that I do recommend.",1502496000,,1250,4.73394495412844

The scene of the German 10th Panzer Division was shot in Victorville California, in the high desert near the U.S. NTC (National Training Center.)  I was a tank mechanic there for a while in the Reserves.

We all know that Tom Cruise is in the film but it is interesting to see how many other actors you recognize. See if you can spot Halina Reijn when she is all buttoned up. You will also notice that the music pays a character in the film. Occasionally the sound drowned out the dialog (a common movie mistake.)

Lots of color and no lame ersatz German accents.

Basic story is this is the last of a series of attempts on Hitler by Germans.  Each character has a different reason and idea on why. However the bottom line is this is a suspense action movie with the end results of dispatching Hitler.

Adolf Hitler, ""The Valkyrie; handmaidens of the gods, choosing who will live and who will die, sparing the most heroic from an agonizing death. One cannot understand National Socialism if one does not understand Wagner.""

Only saw this on Blu-ray so I cannot compare to other presentations.

3674960,4,B001KZIRKY,"I knew what was going to happen, of course, but they still kept it interesting...in part, due to the nice range of actors.  Tom Cruise is not my favorite, but I thought he did a decent job, but the supporting actors I know from other movies and British TV, bravo!  It succeeding in still being suspenseful, despite knowing the outcome.  I hadn't been aware of all of the plot, so that was a bonus.

The movie is based on history, wherein one final attempt is made by German politicians and soldiers to kill Hitler so they can negotiate an end to the war and take back Germany.  I found it compelling how difficult it was for them to balance their honor and love of country against the oath they all took to Hitler.  When it treason not treason?  When the one who is running the country not only is crazy and evil, but no longer serves that self-same country.  These men risked their lives and the lives of their families in order to do the right thing.

A good movie.  Maybe, not a great movie...but the lessons it teaches should well be remembered.",1474416000,,1049,4.38860103626943

In my opinion, the movie Valkyrie was a rare gem in accordance with history's events.  Initially, I doubted that Cruise could pull off this challenging role.  In photos, Colonel von Stauffenberg appears taller and leaner than the stocky actor and of course this fact could not be totally overcome.  Despite my pessimistic first expectations, Cruise turned in a good performance.  Surprisingly, the film also increased my appreciation of how well thought-out Colonel von Stauffenberg's plot was and the dangers that all the members of that brave group faced by trying to prevent Germany's total defeat.",1464998400,2,720,5.336283185840708

I feel bad to say this as a negative, but one never forgets it's Tom Cruise.  While Mr. Cruise is excellent it's always Tom Cruise playing the character and there were some other performances that if in a film of the 1950's-60's their performances would be appropriate, but for today if felt like over-acting.

3674996,5,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie is a taut thriller about the most famous plot to kill Hitler. This was not  plotted by disaffected political opponents but by some of the highest members of the German military. The story is based on real history and stays close to the facts. When the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, high ranking military figures saw the inevitable outcome and wished to prevent a total catastrophe by arranging a surrender. With Hitler and the Nazis running the show they knew this was not an option and could not even be spoken, so they decided to act on their own, lacking only a man to work out the details and carry them out. eventually they found Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a war hero injured in Tunisia, who was equally disaffected with Hitler.

The Colonel is played by Tom Cruise in a somewhat dialed back performance that has drawn criticism from some. This is an ensemble work where Cruise is just one actor among many and he wisely chose to act it that way. This is not a big Tom Cruise vehicle, as many of his films are, and that approach would have made him look hammy and distorted the facts. This was a high level plot, not an action hero venture. Most people do like him in the film as well as the film itself. Of course a number of critics trashed it, but that's because they hate Tom Cruise for reasons outside the film. Famously, one critic who trashed the film, but  didn't seem to recall many of the details, later had to confess that he hadn't seen it.

Unless you're already familiar with the story, I recommend reading a little background before seeing the film, even if it's just a Wikipedia article. There are a lot of characters here and though they may be known in Germany that aren't generally known elsewhere. The first time I saw this film, in a theater, I knew nothing and wasn't always clear who was who. Streaming it this time on Amazon, I read a bit beforehand and it made a big difference.",1462579200,2,1934,4.43943661971831

3675120,4,B001KZIRKY,"How much you enjoy this movie will greatly depend on how familiar you are with the Valkyrie plot already. This is not the venue to learn about this historical event. While it's mostly accurate, there is a ton of detail that's left out.

If you are familiar with the Valkyrie plot to kill Adolf Hitler, I suspect you'll enjoy this movie. Personally I've read about Valkyrie for years and have always been fascinated with the story. This movie was interesting as it gave me a well made visual presentation of a story I knew very well. But I suspect it you aren't familiar with this story that it would be very hard to follow.

It's very well made. The sets are believable. The props and costumes are perfectly recreate WWII Germany.

The problem with the movie is that for all they do well to recreate a theme of WWII Germany....most of the actors make no attempt to hide their British heritage. Watching British Nazis just removes you from the story somehow. Most of the Nazis have clear British accents, except for the lead, who's clearly American. I'm fine with them speaking English because I don't like reading subtitles for 2 hours. But can we at least get mild German accents? The guy playing Hitler sounds German (or Austrian, if you want to get technical). How come Hitler sounds German but everyone else is British? It's just weird.

Other stories have English language with German accents and it works fine. The Man In The High Castle has the Germans speaking English with German accents. It works. It makes them more German and draws the viewer in. Heck even Hogans Heroes gave us German sounding Germans. Even if they made everyone have American accents it would have been better. But British? They were the prime enemy of Germany. It's like watching Red Sox fans cheer at a baseball game but you're not supposed to notice they are wearing Yankee jerseys. It's just too much of a stretch.",1461715200,5,1899,4.659701492537313

3675141,3,B001KZIRKY,"It looks great, it doesn't play too awfully loose with the facts, and it has an excellent supporting cast. Sadly, it also has a black hole in its center, named Tom Cruise. It's just very hard to believe he's a German when he can't even pronounce words like Goebbels and some others. That might seem like nitpicking, but it speaks to a lazy, entitled Hollywood star attitude that the guy couldn't even bother to get it right, and either no one on set realized he was mispronouncing the name of one of the most infamous and powerful men in the Reich, or they didn't have the guts to correct him. And the laziness extends to his whole performance. He seems to have thought that by mouthing his too-often pretentious lines and looking good in an eye patch was all that was necessary. Fie. It's a shame that the fine performances by so many other (British) actors in the cast all had to revolve around his.",1461628800,4,901,4.466666666666667

I only wish there had more battle scenes in the movie as that would have helped round it out nicely.

3675194,3,B001KZIRKY,The movie is well executed but Tom Cruise just can't pull it off. He looks so out of place compared to the other actors who are believable in their roles. He doesn't even try to portray a German national with any realism or conviction. It is amazing how much better the unknown actors are then he. What was Brian Singer thinking? But from a historical point of view the realization of this epic moment in the history of the Third Reich was on target and compelling.,1461024000,7,465,4.4186046511627906

I would have given it 5 stars, but the lack of Field Marshall Rommel's involvement in the plot was disappointing.  That was my only problem with the movie.  I highly recommend watching this.

I think this is why I enjoyed this movie a lot... nobody biased me one way or another.  I came to this movie to be entertained.  I got more than I bargained for.

All the actors' performances struck me and the premise of the movie moved me.  I know a lot about WWII in the South East Asia-Pacific part of the world as my grandmother lived through it.  I was not so much aware of these group of Germans and I am glad I watched this movie and learned about them.

I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan but with that said, he does capture the part. He does a great job. The only problem I have with the movie is the flow of the picture, along with editing. It seemed to Hollywood. The movie wasn't gritty enough for WW2 and the events that happened. It was showcased around a big budget and it seemed too stylized. I'm a fan of the movie. I just think it needed more. It didn't showcase enough of the reality that well over 100 people schemed and created and tried to kill Hitler. The movie needed more of the horrors or personalities of those who went along with this moment in history. Plus I think one has to know a bit of World War 2 history to fully grasp the subject matter at hand. I am a huge World War 2 buff and just felt it needed more plot, but with that said, I still enjoyed it, liked it and it's worthy of a watch.",1454371200,,978,4.098958333333333

3675284,5,B001KZIRKY,"I knew the history and exactly how it turned out, but this film still kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  Tom Cruise's performance as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg carries the film with an excellent supporting cast and outstanding production values.  To the best of my knowledge, the film is historically accurate in all the major details.  One point that came out in the film played only a minor role in the development of the events, but it is a significant history lesson:  Some of von Stauffenberg's advisors said that Reichsfhrer Heinrich Himmler was the important target; there was no point in killing Hitler unless they got Himmler, too.  Based on my reading of history, I agree with them.  It appears that Himmler was the true author of Hitler's madness.  But, alas, von Stauffenberg was blindly focused on the poster boy for the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler.

If there is a moral lesson to be learned from this story, it must be that if you find yourself supporting a leaders who turn out to be a psychopathic madmen whose decisions are destroying your country, you need to take action long before you are forced to attempt desperate schemes to get rid of them.  And don't overlook the source of the disease while you are treating the symptoms.  Don't be blinded by the superstar.

A war hero who tried to kill Hitler and end Nazi tyranny under the guise of Operation Valkyrie with a host of other people that wanted dignity for Germany.  It is a classic World War II era film in my opinion.  Great movie sets, uniforms, and all around feel of the Third Reich.",1433894400,2,387,4.1891891891891895
3675298,5,B001KZIRKY,"The word ""Walkre"" (aka Valkyrie in English) comes from German composer Richard Wagner's opera ""Die Walkre"", the third installment of his fantasy cycle ""The Ring of the Nibelung"". In Wagner's ""The Ring"", the Valkyries were winged maidens who fly to battlefields to raise fallen heroes and take them to the great sanctuary of Valhalla. Walkre was also the code-name for a military operation created by the German-Nazi regime to be enacted if Adolf Hitler suddenly died. Although the film itself refers to the word in the latter sense as a military-coup operation, the film is also a referendum on the fallen heroes who lost their lives trying to save Germany. ""Valkyrie"" the film becomes the Valkyries of these fallen heroes.

Certainly, when we think of the heroes of World War II, our minds conjure images of Roosevelt, Churchill, Patton, Eisenhower and Montgomery. But aside from the political leaders and military commanders, many civilians and lower-ranking military officers were involved in resistance movements in both France and Germany who wanted Hitler stopped. These people, many whose names have been lost to history, risked their lives to undermine the German-Nazi Regime that not only occupied many European countries but began persecuting and executing innocent people. ""Valkyrie"", starring Tom Cruise in his best role since ""Jerry Maguire"", Kenneth Branaugh (""Henry V"" by Shakespeare), and a host of notable supporting talent including Terence Stamp (General Zod of ""Superman"" I and II), and Tom Wilkinson (""Michael Clayton""), documents the last but most elaborate plot to assassinate Hitler before Germany and Austria would be devastated by the allied forces, and also save the remaining lives of people dying in concentration camps. They wanted to demonstrate that not all German citizens, both military and civilian, approved of Hitler's vision of Germany that included such inhumane intolerance.

The assassination and coup attempt was headed by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise), a decorated military officer who was loyal to Germany but detested Hitler's strategy and ultimately his ""final solution"" persecution of innocent civilians. Many of the events as portrayed in the movie actually occurred. When Stauffenberg loses a few limbs and an eye after one of his last military campaigns, he is seduced into joining a band of conspirators made up of high-ranking military and civilian personnel. The conspirators simply want to assassinate Hitler, but Stauffenberg points out that an assassination is not enough. A detailed military coup needs to be enacted, otherwise the highest-ranking members of the SS would simply take over the government where Hitler left off and continue the dictatorship.

Among the many detailed plans in the German Government is an operation known as Walkre (aka Valkyrie in English), a detailed military strategy that outlines how the government would continue in the event of the death of Adolf Hitler. Since Hitler was absolute dictator during the Nazi Regime, there were no constitutional guidelines for succession and/or transfer of power. The conspirators who want to oust Hitler through assassination decide to use the military's own plan to take control of the the government before the SS.

The film chronicles the debates between the conspirators, the assassination plan, and then the plan itself. The only minor criticism of the film is occasionally the conspirators are shown discussing their plots, sometimes only a room away from the Fhrer himself! Knowing that conspirators were often plotting, the German-Nazi regime would constantly watch and survey anyone and everyone for even the slightest inkling of disloyalty. Even those who were innocent but did not report suspicions quickly enough to authorities could find themselves under arrest. However, at other moments, the conspirators use coded language to indicate their intentions which seem much more realistic.

Overall an outstanding and compelling film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the best films of its type in recent memory, a tragic but honorable subject. The film details relatively accurately the actions of a small group of people willing to risk their lives to stand up to Hitler and show the world that not everyone in Germany would kill or be killed without question or pause. This film is for those people outside the allied forces who tried to right a terrible wrong. They lost the coup and their lives, but ultimately they won.",1433894400,3,4485,5.3023909985935305

3675330,5,B001KZIRKY,"Absolutely spectacular movie for anyone who enjoys films and televisions shows depicting the  Second World War.  This film is featured as a gritty political thriller similar to his work in films like ""Mission Impossible"", & even Cruise himself had stated it was not a traditional WW2 movie.  But with that said I found this film to be one of the absolute bests WW2 movies I had ever seen among many.

 The movie asks us an important question, at what point should people act if their government leadership is that horrible and that terribly corrupt?  This film asks, what should true military men, ethical political scientists who have been thrown on the sideline, and police officials do when their government is run by the most disgusting and evil of men?  Even if one hates the current political leadership, does that give them the right to kill them?  At what point should men go into action?  Or should they remain loyal to a plan of destruction and national suicide?

""God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find ten righteous men... I have a feeling that for Germany, it may come down to one."" -Henning von Tresckow.

  This film not only addresses an historical topic not covered enough in modern media, about the many (probably with out any doubt) the vast majority of Germans who completely opposed Hitler and his psychopath regime from Hell, possibly even from the start of his rise to power.

 Actor Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean, Underworld, Wrath of the Titans, Love Actually) is an actor I really like, and enjoy.  Nighy portrays the Vermarch General Albrech very well as a bureaucratic by the book regimented man who knows what he has to do, but has to develop the testicles and inner ""self sacrificing"" courage to stand for what is right in the face of darkness.

Cruise's lower ranking Stauffenberg ignights the fires in many of the reluctant and complacent men among the Army's reserve high command to carry on with their dangerous and desperate plan to finally find a method to kill Hitler and his inner political henchmen.

 The bomb planted in the ""Wolf's Lair"" had been allegedly the fifteenth attempt upon Hitler's life 9 months prior to him committing suicide in his bunker during the fall of Berlin to the Red Army.  We all know how the movie will end, for anyone who knows real war history, but we still find ourselves as an audience glued to the cause of these historically noble, courageous, and brave men who risked and lost it all attempting to Patriotically save their country, and most of the world by killing one of history's most brutal tyrants.

 Cruise not only looks like the real historical Colonel Von Stauffenberg, he also emotionally moves us with his military driven passion and larger then life quest to bring down the man and his regime which caused so much world suffering.  He plays the role of an outstanding soldier very well in this movie, you really do feel as if Cruise is Stauffenberg.

 I rarely ever get that emotionally moved with films or television, as I did watching this powerful piece because it revealed a truth to me that had been hidden from most of the world's history books, that there really were vast majority of altruistic, brave, and morally ethical German citizens who were not Nazis and did take a stand, many who paid with their lives and suffered terribly before their deaths, against the face of pure evil.  Thanks to these awesome film makers, we have been told the real historical truth hidden from us for political reasons.

 Many Germans and Europeans in total at that time did not support, nor share any of Hitler's bizarre & twisted agendas during the outbreak of the Second World War.

 There were men like Colonel Von Stauffenberg who did remain Patriotic to a different cause that he himself had believed in (whether his own political vision of Germany was the true vision, or was it the Fascist version of Germang the Nazi Party endorsed is all in the eye of the beholder).  The Colonel had never once wavered in his own ideals, defending human freedom while also doing his duty as Soldier of honor, though others may argue the soldiers loyal to the Fascist regime did their brave part in service to their nation's cause also.  He had been a man committed do decency his entire life, and in that commitment he had a duty to risk his own life taking the most audacious and bold of actions, which took incredible guts in the face of certain death.

Fascism & WW2 has always fascinated me to no end.  The uniforms, the soldiers, the weapons, the 'good verses evil"" while at the same time a other them of ""despotism vs despotism"", absolutism with extreme ideals and behaviors that had stemmed from Fascism.  A political and military movement had not been seen on Earth since maybe the time of the Romans, only to die out in the ashes of Hell in 1945.

 The actor who played Hitler himself was absolutely amazing, out of ALL the WW2 movies I have seen I have never viewed a movie depict Hitler so darn well.

""The Valkyrie; handmaidens of the gods, choosing who will live and who will die, sparing the most heroic from an agonizing death. One cannot understand National Socialism if one does not understand Wagner."" - Adolf Hitler

I said to myself while watching this fine actor's performance, ""Now this was the real Furher, this was Adolf!""  One element that had completely made this actor so believable was these film makers did their homework, because Hitler had admired and was so obsessed with the music from Wagner & his operas.  Nazi Germany itself seemed to be a super political and military driven painted canvas, or other form of art by Hitler in the image of Wagner's Germanic mythologically themed operas.

 The appearance of Hitler in the film is fairly brief, for the focus is on Tom Cruise and his team's struggles trying to keep secrets, hold meetings, engineer what type of device they need to use, and not get caught while the police state of the Gestapo are always lurking about, hungry like predator sharks.

 I also loved how the Fuhrer & his regime's presence had haunted and stalked the heroes of this film where ever they had went, with all of the paintings and imagery of the German dictator around them it felt as if the omnipresent power of this dark ""big brother"" - ""big evil government"" monster had stalked & toyed with them.  Even during the scenes when Hitler isn't even around, he's still there haunting Cruise & company.  It reminded me of Darth Vader in ""Star Wars"", or Smaug the Dragon from the more recent ""Hobbit"" series, where the power of the villain always overwhelmed the good guys no matter what.  These heroes were little mice in a giant maze controlled by a big cat.

The period's uniforms, vehicles, weapons, combat depictions, and scenery really had been as if you the audience member were taken to the 1930's & 40's Europe.

 Absolutely brilliant movie and a must for my WW2 movie collection.  Two thumbs up and A+ for Valkyrie.  Brian Singer & Cruise really had made a masterpiece here.",1426291200,3,7048,4.697068403908795

The movie was exciting, suspenseful; educational and very well acted overall, and as far as I know, pretty accurate historically.

I think it's important that world citizenry be aware of the anti Nazi-ism prevalent in many WW2 Germans, and what they suffered for their sentiments: loyal to their country, but not to Hitler.

Its pleasure, instead, is in the performances of the supporting cast which includes a wide variety of excellent actors in even the most minor roles. It's a little comical to watch the lead performer (Cruise) because he's the only one who can't act, and the effect is reminiscent of Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing, in which the American actors (brought in to add box office appeal) are hopelessly out-acted in every scene by the Europeans for whom Shakespeare is second nature. But so long as you either ignore or mentally excerpt Cruise's atrociously bland performance, the supporting roles are a near-constant source of pleasure that even the talentless lead can't spoil. Too bad this was a vanity vehicle; with a proper actor in the lead role and a few script alterations this could have been a very engrossing movie.",1422057600,2,1074,4.972222222222222
3675357,4,B001KZIRKY,Very well done WWII movie that is well worth seeing. Cruise does a terrific job but the the entire cast is all star.

3675382,4,B001KZIRKY,"This film is about the epic attempt to kill Hitler in July 1944. Cruise is Von Stauffenberg, an officer in the German army who decides the only way to save Germany, is to kill Hitler. Hes not the only one and he becomes the leader of quite a number of like-minded soldiers and citizens. It is not easy. Hitler is paranoid and hard to get near. He is erratic in his habits and personality and frankly has an astounding dose of the Devils luck. He is also a megalomaniac who consolidated his hold on Germany with murders and the imposition of the strictest police state. Ordinary Germans could be executed or sent to a Concentration camp for any number of anti-state activities, including; being critical of Nazi leadership, not supporting the war effort and even failing to work fast enough. The individuals in the plot were very much risking their lives and given Hitlers maniacal methods, the lives of their families too. This was a terror state in every sense of the word. Yet to do nothing, meant the worst war in history would result in the utter destruction of Germany and its condemnation by the world for the horrors it had caused. So Von Stauffenberg and others acted.

Count Von Stauffenburg was an extremely brave man and Cruise honours him with his performance. Though handicapped by war injuries, he still showed leadership and determination that inspired the waverers around him. Sometimes violence is the answer. He is supported by other heroes and it is a tragedy their efforts failed. The film is truly tense in how it depicts the events of that fateful day. There are many notable actors in support and the scenes and equipment are excellent in creating an authentic picture of the time. This is a very impressive film about a very important event in a key time in human history. Highly recommended.",1418601600,,1816,4.728706624605678

Too much emphasis is still placed upon its star Tom Cruise despite the effort of United Artists later attempts to diffuse the films focus on Cruise. If the studio was serious in this endeavor they would've changed the cover by removing Tom Cruise's name from the top. Cruise has one thing going for him in this role, and that is his uncanny resemblance to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. As for his performance, it is another one note performance. There is just no variance in Cruise as an actor. He plays that one note and he plays it well, yet it becomes boring after awhile and you are reminded that this is a Tom Cruise picture after all.",1407542400,,755,4.518248175182482

Colonel Clause Von Stauffenberg would have succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler if he placed the suit case bomb in the right place where Hitler was sitting in the wolfs lair THEN history could have been made very different and a lot of people could have lived longer and a lot less blood shed. Stauffenberg was a hero on all of this because he knew that Hitler was the beginning and the end of the coming world war when no one else has the sense of learning it and he died trying to prove it to the world. And in the end he was proven correct and if only he succeeded.... (sigh),1407024000,,627,4.233333333333333

The supporting cast is stellar; it would be difficult to find a more capable group of actors: Sir Kenneth Branagh , Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Jamie Parker, and the list goes on. These actors brought their A-game and turned in performances that would remind any film lover of why they love film and theater itself. The script was well-written and paid much more attention to historical accuracy than any script I've seen put to film in Hollywood in a Very, VERY long time. I think the negative publicity surrounding Cruise's personal life at the time and his separation from Paramount had a lot to do with why this film did not and does not get the credit it deserves. It bites; it is heartbreaking. It packs a punch and it tells a story that, for once in Hollywood, actually needed to be told. If you can put any personal feelings for Cruise aside, and appreciate not only the Oscar-worthy performances but the story itself, you'll find this is a can't miss film.",1406592000,,1115,4.66497461928934

Watching this on the laptop was a little tough.  There is a lot of whispering in this movie and was hard to hear.  I don't think Tom Cruise was the answer for this role.  There are many tall, slender, blonde haired men with an accent in Hollywood that would have suited the part better.  A different leading actor may have driven me to give it 4 stars.

Not only based on a true story - and from what I have read historically pretty accurately portrayed, but also it was done without all of the flying body parts that are usually associated with these films.  I applaud the dedication to historical fact and the restraint shown in not sensationalizing the gore.

I also didn't know how they tried to set up an alternate government. It was amazing how Hitler was wasn't impacted. I kept on thinking, if only, if only! Only a direct shot to his head would have taken him out. They seemed to be in such a rush to get him that they didn't think things through thoroughly.

3675594,4,B001KZIRKY,"I was expecting a bad movie.  I mean really, it's Americans playing Germans...

BUT...  It's at least loosely based on real events and the subject matter is unique for an action movie.  I was actually moved by the bravery and sacrifice portrayed by these people, and it started a discussion about the division between the SS and regular army/populous during those terrible times.  Recommended.",1401408000,,393,5.078125
3675595,4,B001KZIRKY,"Tom Cruise is excellent in his very realistic portrayal of a German officer who joins the movement to kill Hitler before he destroys Germany. One item from history that is explained well is the failure of the explosive to kill Hitler at a meeting because the group was moved to a different, larger building. The original location was a cement, reinforced room that would have contained the explosion and scrambled everybody inside. At the end of the film, the conspirators are arrested and executed in various ways. One group of officers that was treated especially horribly was hanged with piano wire. That's a slow, painful way to die. History accounts that Hitler wanted that to be filmed so he could view it later. The movie did not explain that part well, but it briefly showed the hanging.

The background was fun to watch. I enjoyed the historical vehicles, uniforms and the personal interplay between the Cruise character and his family.  I recommend this movie.",1401408000,,970,4.908536585365853

3675597,2,B001KZIRKY,Violent and choppy without a clear plot line. The cast was not authentic and the events were not aligned to what really took place. Way too Hollywood in presentation.,1401321600,,166,4.758620689655173
3675598,2,B001KZIRKY,Not the best movie on the subject. Acting was so so. The supporting actors were much better than the lead. The plot was factual and still fascinates after 70years.,1401321600,,163,4.655172413793103
3675599,5,B001KZIRKY,"If only the band of conspiritors portrayed here had been successful, think of the thousands of lives to be saved, the damage averted and the years of suffering throughout Europe avoided. A small group of World War II era German military officers and civilian leaders plot to assassinate Hitler, establish an interim civilian government, and sue for peace, i.e. surrender. Their belief, the war was already lost for them, continued fighting would only bring death and suffering to millions throughout Europe. This really did happen. It was one of 15 documented attempts on Hitler's life, all of them failing until Hitler and mistress Eva Braun took their own lives during the Allied siege of Berlin. We know how this is going to end, but throughout I found myself rooting for Tom Cruise and his fellow conspiritors. They sought not power for themselves for for the sake of power, but to give Germany and Europe a chance for a better post-war era, and to end what the Cruise character called Hitler's assault on the proud honor of the German military.",1401235200,,1049,4.865921787709497

3675602,3,B001KZIRKY,"Like many I'm sure, I had an overly simplified idea of killing Adolf Hitler.  Kill the man and the Reich falls.  If only it were that simple.  A plan was needed to circumvent the die hard loyalists, like the SS, and seize control of the government.  The Nazis already had a plan in place.  The trick for Cruise and his coconspirators was to implement it without it looking like the coup attempt it was.

3675635,4,B001KZIRKY,"When I was in history class in the 60's and 70's, I never learned that there were Germans who attempted to stand up to Hitler's Germany other than the civilians who helped hide the Jews or courageous pastors like Bohnhoffer who spoke out against the Nazi regime and were executed for it.  I was always conflicted about this because my background is primarily German and it was difficult for me to think that more nationals would not have stood against the atrocities committed.  This movie, as well as the information that Valkyrie was the 15th and last uprising against the Nazi regime was of great comfort to me.  The movie is well worth watching and, because it is not horrifically bloody or violent, would be appropriate, in my opinion,  for children as young as junior high.",1399852800,,779,4.705882352941177

It is an important story that needed to be told about the courageous men who tried to stop Hitler and his insanity.  Though I am not a Tom Cruise fan, he did an excellent job in this role as the person who put his life on the line to kill Hitler.  The supporting cast was phenomenal and many well know actors were present here.  It is a fast moving but well written film.  It is so realistic you feel as if you are there.

 Although I had heard that there were many failed plots to kill Hitler and stop the Nazis, I never knew the details about them or the names of those who took part.  We hear so much about the evil of the Nazi regime, but we must have all wondered if  there was anyone who resisted the madness.  This movie shows there were many who did, with courage and commitment, knowing they might die to save all they held dear.  It is good to know their names and give them tribute for standing up for what was right.",1399766400,,1039,4.114427860696518

The movie is plodding and filled with anti-Hitler politicians that I just don't care about one way or another.  Even Hitler's appearances, whether historically accurate or not, make it seem like he's taken far too much Ambien.  I also found it extremely annoying that all the Nazis and the German officers have British accents.  The British were fighting them even before we were.

I wasn't sure if I would like this movie or not going inwar movies are hit of miss with mebut I ended up really enjoying this one.  My wife also liked it.  I know some people would disagree with this, but I actually liked how they had everyone speak English in the movie.  Even if it is more authentic, when everyone is speaking a foreign language and you have to read subtitles it can really take away from the total effect of the movie.  If Im struggling to keep up with the dialogue, how am I supposed to pay attention to everything else going on?  It may work for some people.  Im just not one of them.  Overall I found this movie to be enjoyable and would recommend it to any history buffs, people who enjoy action movies, and people who enjoy a good war movie.

This movie took a critical pummeling because it's hero is played by star Tom Cruise, yet he played an unsuccessful hero, one who risked his family and reputation and lost.

If his role was taken from the annals of history he gives it a nice try but doesn't quite pull it off. The action and intrigue is measured and not as epic as I think the writers and producers thought the results would be. A star studded cast is a difficult thing to manage and this one was an odd ensemble of actors better known for quirky parts in fantasy films; not the stuff that gives good support a period piece that might have some semblance of fact-based historic records behind it. Perhaps, it's time that Tom consider some other genre than action flicks and high drama.

3675706,5,B001KZIRKY,I enjoyed Valkyrie very much- its a well acted realistic movie that kind of brings you back to earth..Highly reccomend.,1398297600,,119,5.0
3675707,3,B001KZIRKY,The story followed actual events and it showed how desperate some of the German people were at this point in the war. Tom cruise was believable in his part but was not exceptional.,1398297600,,180,4.484848484848484
3675708,5,B001KZIRKY,This movie is awesome! A must see! I was very glad to find it on amazon. The quality is perfect and a terrific movie.,1398297600,,117,3.9166666666666665
3675709,4,B001KZIRKY,"Whether you like Tom Cruise of not, this move is a must see to get a more accurarte view of the German military as it was led by a true madman.",1398297600,,143,3.6451612903225805
3675710,5,B001KZIRKY,"We rarely hear about the domestic opposition in Nazi-Germany. High ranking officers had sworn their allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Still under the surface of duty and loyalty was a growing resentment and desire to end a war that every officer knew could only end in a total defeat for Germany.
This semi-documentary offers an excellent insight to the sentiments in the Germany army. Most Prussian officers couldn't stand this corporal and dilettante. In 1944 they had had it. The assassination plot is told with great compassion and understanding of the forces that planned and executed it. The movie is manifestation of an era never to be forgotten.",1398211200,,647,5.05607476635514
3675711,4,B001KZIRKY,I know he wasn't killed in reality but at least in the movie it would've been nice if he died.  Other than that it's thrilling and entertaining to watch.,1398211200,,153,4.275862068965517
3675712,3,B001KZIRKY,"Watchable. It's an average flick and I was never tempted to turn it off half way through. Cruise has  a tough time trying pull off the role of a German aristocrat but again, it's passable fare.",1398211200,,193,4.361111111111111
3675713,4,B001KZIRKY,Entertaining plot and that has you cheering for one side. Even though you know the outcome of such events you tend to forget that during the movie and almost hope that it actually panned out as hoped.,1398211200,,200,4.4324324324324325
3675714,3,B001KZIRKY,"What else can I say, it's a Tom Cruise movie. Not what I was expecting.
Not all that good.
Enough said",1398211200,,102,3.9047619047619047
3675715,3,B001KZIRKY,"This is such a great story of actual history, it's a shame it wasn't produced with that in mind. The documentary is far better than this movie, which is just a platform for Cruise to ""vogue"" around in German uniform.",1398211200,,216,4.425
3675716,5,B001KZIRKY,Never lost interest in the gripping story - good to know about heroes and what they sacrificed for the good of all.,1398124800,,115,4.2727272727272725
3675717,4,B001KZIRKY,"The movie was very good. The only downside was the fact that the ending was known (since we all know Hitler was not assinated!).
But Tom Cruise does an excellent job in this movie.",1398124800,,180,4.323529411764706
3675718,4,B001KZIRKY,"Based loosely on a true story this movie has a fine supporting cast teamed with a dynamic lead actor. I think it probably would have been next to impossible to have carried out a conspiracy to assassinate a leader of a country during a war that had seemingly had every atrocity conceivable to mankind and then some. I thought you had to be really convicted, or totally insane to even entertain a thought of killing Hitler.
Brutality and fear are very persuasive when it comes to thwarting an attempt at any kind of violence in a volatile situation. The drama kept me on the edge of my seat. I really felt sorry for the German people that were not in favor of killing the world...",1398124800,,679,4.44
3675719,4,B001KZIRKY,This was an important true story and the plot was suspenseful.  The landscape and city shots are beautiful and seemed to really capture the time period.  It was slow or boring at times.,1398124800,,185,4.575757575757576
3675720,4,B001KZIRKY,"Don't usually watch movies of this type and era much anymore.  We gave it a go since Tom Cruise was starring in this film.  From the very beginning I was captured in the story, was very suspenseful.",1398124800,,198,4.324324324324325
3675724,5,B001KZIRKY,I'm a big WWII nut and have read countless books on the subject including this one. Granted it's not an AMAZING movie but it's good overall and great for anyone not familiar with the story.,1398038400,,189,4.428571428571429
3675725,3,B001KZIRKY,It's good if you want to get a little better insight on this very well documented event. They obviously add dramatic scenes but it's a good flick to watch.,1398038400,,155,4.379310344827586
3675726,4,B001KZIRKY,Great movie!!! Anyone interested in assassinations and fascist leaders should wash it. It weaves history and fiction together to keep you intrigued.,1398038400,,148,5.7727272727272725
3675727,4,B001KZIRKY,I recently read the book Bonhoeffer and was interested in how the book and the movie dovetailed.  Many of the characters/persons were the same.  I enjoy history.,1398038400,,161,4.925925925925926
3675728,4,B001KZIRKY,"Another WWII flick, which for me is a good thing. A lot of this one is factual.  Unfortunately I knew the outcome before, so the dramatic tension wasn't there. But, still enjoyable.",1397952000,,181,4.65625
3675729,3,B001KZIRKY,very slow and tom cruise as a german!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! casting could have been better not really my idea of a war movie,1397952000,,116,4.571428571428571
3675730,5,B001KZIRKY,Well done. The movie'a cinematography is excellent. They depict the edgy darkness of hitler and the riech. Tom play his character well.,1397952000,,135,5.181818181818182
3675731,3,B001KZIRKY,"Did not hold my interest.  The sound would go up then down, making it hard to hear and understand.  It got frustrating.",1397952000,,119,4.363636363636363
3675732,4,B001KZIRKY,"The only power protecting Hitler was Lucifer aka Satan, Beelzebub, Prince of Darkness et.al!  It certainly by any stretch could not be attributed to the GOD I worship and serve!  If nothing else this film and its details prove beyond andy reasonable doubt that the Ruler of this World is who Paul wrote about in Galatians Chp 6!!  Stauffenberg was the only stalwart and courageous member of this plot!  Hitler later had the other leaders strung up by piano wire and had films made of each execution for his personal enjoyment.  Does this detail erase any doubt in your mind that he was a madman, megalomaniac, homicidal criminal, and worse???",1397865600,,642,4.8
3675733,4,B001KZIRKY,"Interesting movie about part of history not so well known. Tom Cruise nt the best choice for the head role, but still doing fine.",1397865600,,129,4.416666666666667
3675743,3,B001KZIRKY,"Yes, this is a well done a Hollywood movie. Even the movie based on the actual event, the storyline is way off from actual facts and attitude of the era, which is typical for Hollywood. Just watch it as a movie (entertainment), it is not a historical drama.",1397865600,,257,4.375
3675744,5,B001KZIRKY,"Underrated, awesome movie. Very good. Loved it. Historically correct and accurate. Tom Cruz was excellent. I did not expect to like as much as I did.",1397865600,,149,4.769230769230769
3675745,5,B001KZIRKY,I stumbled on this movie on prime. Its been out for a while and never knew about it. I really don't care for any of the newer movies holly wood puts out today. This movie was well done and Tom Cruise did an excellant job portraying his character,1397779200,,245,4.125
3675746,4,B001KZIRKY,"I enjoyed Valkyrie.  Sure, it's not the best movie, but it has it's moments.  Tom Cruise does a good job without having a fake accent.  I really like Kenneth Brannaugh.  He is great.",1397779200,,182,4.424242424242424

3675751,5,B001KZIRKY,"I've watched this movie twice and having never been a Tom Cruise fan I think he did a nice job.

Thankfully it's not a chick flick, so girls you will want to pass on this one. Guys who like war movies will like this.",1397779200,,216,3.909090909090909
3675752,3,B001KZIRKY,"von Stauffenberg had a very different personality than that portrayed in this film. No, I do not intend to write a review about a 'documentary' or original source information. The intent of this film was to offer those who are not familiar with the German resistance in the military command a reasonably historical portrayal. Facts were researched and historians interviewed and the film was reviewed and edited. Tom Cruise was considered a liability because of his connection with Scientology (especially by von Stauffenberg's family). Now to the film!

The cinematology is excellent and some scenes were shot on location in Germany. The acting is within reason but it would seem that the 'accents' are inconsistent . . . easy enough to ignore and focus on the storyline. Certainly worth watching for those interested in the WWII genre.

I read multiple reviews from one star to five stars and decided on a 4- or a 3+ . . . read reviews from 1 to 5 before making a decision. 'Valkyrie' is offered with Amazon prime and I would choose to rent the film. The streaming was smooth and the audio was crisp. Perhaps one reviewer's iPad couldn't stream smoothly . . . I had no technical problems with a Kindle Fire, Acer 11.6"" computer or a video/audio cable to a 52"" television. Cable from computer to TV is simple and I frequently switch devices. With that said and as a serious student of military history, I enjoyed the film!",1397692800,,1423,4.733870967741935
3675753,5,B001KZIRKY,I've watched this movie several times and thoroughly enjoy it each viewing! Tom does a great job as the main character.,1397692800,,119,4.714285714285714
3675754,5,B001KZIRKY,"This move gave Tom Cruise a really great role to act and boy did he delivered. Not your typical Top Gun Or Mission Impossible roles.

3675757,3,B001KZIRKY,"Jack Preacher was a better movie than this.  Even though it was based on true events, it was slow and tiresome waiting on the next big climax to happen.  Not much to say about the movie.  Tom Cruise has done better.",1397606400,,215,4.195121951219512

3675760,3,B001KZIRKY,"I understand poetic license. I've been a professional writer for many years. But this rendition of one of the attempts to assassinate Hitler is so mixed up that you're forced to decide whether it's comedy or writers with very little knowledge of the history of the event. The movie acts like there were many conspirators involved, but the film does not mention the 99.5% plebiscite in favor of Hitler shortly after he was legally and democratically elected by the German people. If the movie had paid attention to these facts, it would have been far more interesting.",1397520000,,567,4.855670103092783

3675767,5,B001KZIRKY,Valkyrie is an untold story that does not end well.  Although based on a true accounting insight of Hitler's Germany for most people there is something to be learned here. You will not like the outcome of the film.,1397520000,,214,4.487179487179487

I'm not that guy. I enjoyed the movie for the story. It was good to watch even though I have seen the story in a couple other movies. It still kept me entertained. I read a book if I want 100% factual content. Just watch,1397433600,,386,4.22972972972973

3675771,4,B001KZIRKY,"Fairly honorable.  I'm not certain of historical accuracy and I don't think that using Tom Cruise made the film touch the historical elements.

Even though we know the ending, the story manages to escalate hugely in tension. My one disappointment is that in the opening, they have Von Stauffenberg writing a letter indicating that he is appalled by the Nazis' treatment of the Jews. This is totally incorrect and I really hate when filmmakers take liberties with facts when making historically-based films.",1397260800,,532,4.670212765957447

3675787,5,B001KZIRKY,"I can't say enough great things about this movie.  It seems to me that the tabloids are too interested in Tom Cruise's personal life to recognize the fact the he's an extremely talented actor.  My thoughts?  Let his personal life be just that...personal, and enjoy the performances he turns in.

The story of Von Stauffenberg is one of the most daring tales of WW2.  A man of wealth, means and social stature decides to risk it all to rid Germany and world of a madman.  Brave and resolute, Von Stauffenberg undertakes the impossible and, in my mind, valiantly attempts to acquit himself, his family and  the German people of an atrocity.

An ensemble cast of Britain's A-List actors rounded out with Tom Cruise in the starring role makes this movie a must see.",1397088000,,761,4.669172932330827

3675793,5,B001KZIRKY,"I enjoyed this movie greatly because it was from an unexpected perspective.  Of course the acting was what I expected from the cast, but it was the story and the history of heroes seldom voiced or given a 'thank you' in history.  We usually see only one main side to this ghastly war, not the 'resistance' within, those who were NOT just at the 'front', but directly in the middle of this horrendous acid.  I ended up learning a great deal and I learned that honor needs to be spread a lot further then it usually has been.",1396915200,,523,4.316326530612245

There were at least 15 attempts on Hitler's life during the war which shows that not all Germans supported his crazy regime.  One is left to ponder what might have been if one of these attempts had been successful.  This film was better than I expected it to be.",1396828800,,426,4.234567901234568

3675806,5,B001KZIRKY,"The movie was based on the true story of a group of German officers, led by Col. Stauffenberg, who attempted to assassinate Adolph Hitler in 1944. This movie told that story superbly, and the actors in this film were just as superb.  I remember learning about this incident some years ago when I read the excellent series of books authored by Winston Churchill detailing the strategies and battles of WWII.  Alhough I'm far from expert on the subject I believe that this movie coincided well with my recollection of what I read about it then, and since.  Some critics of this film seem bothered by the fact that the actors didn't use German accents in this movie, finding the American and British accented dialogue to be somewhat jarring and unrealistic.  They should remember that the people depicted here did not speak English, nor English with a German accent.  They spoke German, as indicated in the film's opening, when Tom Cruise as Col. Stauffenberg began by speaking German with English subtitles, and then thankfully switched to English, as if it were being translated.  I believe the film makers assumed that the audience would be smart enough to know what was meant by the transition from German to English.  I personally was not bothered by the American-accented English spoken by Tom Cruise, or the slight British accent of many of the other actors.  Even though I knew from my familiarity of this event how it would turn out, I found the movie riveting to the very end, and the special effects spectacular.  I don't know what more you could ask from a movie based on a true story, because I think this one delivered in every way.  I rate it at 5 stars.",1396656000,,1666,4.694158075601375

3675823,5,B001KZIRKY,"This is a brilliant, powerful and very realistic film describing the 20 July 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi regime. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The real story of anti-Nazi plot which ultimately led to 20 July crisis is quite well known, let's therefore just present here the main lines. It was already in 1938 that three high ranking officers of Wehrmacht, Field Marshal Erich von Witzlebben and generals Ludwig Beck and Hans Oster formed a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler. After the Kristallnacht in November 1938 revealed the true face of Nazi regime, they were joined by other people, including a prominent conservative monarchist politician Carl Goerdeler and also Helmuth Graf von Moltke, a simple lawyer but who by his familial background had vast connexions in German aristocracy and other elites.

All attempts to push Wehrmacht commanders to overthrow Hitler however failed and finally the plotters decided that it was necessary to kill Hitler first, before any coup attempt. With time, the group grew larger and more high ranking officers joined, including generals Henning von Tresckow and Friedrich Obricht - it was they who attempted to kill Hitler in March 1943, but the bomb placed in his plane failed to detonate. Unable to pierce Hitler's security, plotters tried to convince again some highest ranking military commanders of Wehrmacht to stage a coup - but without success. It is however revealing, that neither of those men (von Kluge, von Rundstedt, von Manstein and even Rommel!) reported the plotters to Gestapo.

In August 1943 two new men joined the conspiracy, quite junior in grade, but very efficient and devoted - Lieutenant-Colonel (later Colonel) Albrecht Mertz von Quirheim and Lieutenant-Colonel (later also promoted to Colonel) Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. They quite quickly took the control of the planning of the whole conspiracy and the 20 July 1944 crisis was in great part the result of their efforts, with Stauffenberg taking on himself the riskiest part of the operation. I will say no more - if you are not familiar with this story, you deserve to discover this incredible but tru stor by yourself.

This film is a fast paced, very tense and extremely dramatic reconstruction of events preceding the 20 July and of this famous crisis itself. The pace and the suspense are such that at the end of the film it is really hard to believe that 124 minutes passed... The film also tells a tragic tale (it is hardly a spoiler to say that Hitler survived - and therefore the conspirators couldn't...) and yet it is not depressing - the plotters failed, BIG TIME, but they preserved their honor, and therefore once the last words of this film are spoken, it leaves the viewer very shaken and yet somehow strangely elated. Indeed I could also hear Stauffenberg and his companions say those words from the Bible: ""I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I kept the faith"" - especially considering that most of those men were devoted Catholics...

Another treasure of this film is the presentation of life under the Nazi regime with its main ""attraction"" being present everywhere and affecting everybody, the Nazis included - mind paralizing, bones freezing FEAR! With the possible exception of the four men in the First Circle of Power whom we can see briefly in one scene (Hitler, Goring, Goebbels and Himmler) EVERYBODY in Third Reich lived in constant terror, as they could be arrested, tortured and executed at any moment for any reason. This is also why almost everybody in this film all the time takes a great care to not speak too openly, as Gestapo spies and microphones are everywhere...

Actors did an amazing job in this film, including Tom Cruise, who, notwithstanding all the excentricities and oddities of his personal life, is a GREAT ACTOR - and proves it here again! For me, the second best performance in this film was that offered by Bill Nighy, who plays general Olbricht, a man almost paralyzed with fear but who nevertheless soldiers on the best he can. Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson are also excellent.

Bottom line, this is an excellent film telling a true story in a great and very emotional way. I will absolutely keep my DVD for another viewing. Enjoy!",1387756800,,4310,4.9529737206085755
3675824,2,B001KZIRKY,"I didn't like the fact that they spoke in American accents. It would have been better in all German, or at least German accents. Also, the movie was boring and hard to follow.

3675825,4,B001KZIRKY,"Even though we know the ultimate outcome, this film shows the 20 July bomb plot against Hitler happening on a moment--by--moment basis, as if we are living it.  I found myself feeling anxious as Von Staufenberg desperately struggles to arm the briefcase bomb with 3 fingers--almost as if it might blow up at any moment!

  The same applies to decisions made and questions asked by other conspirators.  Must Himmler be assassinated as well?  Do Hitler and Himmler have to be in the same room? Each man decides in a way that we experience as highly personal, and the acting
is first-rate.  Viewers used to seeing Germans during the war as Nazi cliches will find ""Valkyrie"" enlightening.

3675827,5,B001KZIRKY,"It is at once almost impossible to believe that atrocities like the Holocaust can and do actually occur, yet one needs only look around, watch the news, to see that it is true.....
We watch in horror as unimaginable acts unfold before us, but cannot even remotely begin to understand the impact they have - not only on those who are victims by the very nature of their being, but also by those who become the victims of circumstance - those who are propelled into a nightmare they can neither understand nor control.
I felt Tom Cruise displayed, as well as is humanly possible having not actually been there, the true depth of emotion that must come from what can only be the most brutal, torturous conflict from within. He is compelled to destroy this man he knows must be stopped, all the while looking at the faces of his wife and children with the full understanding that this will likely be his own destruction and the destruction of them as well - yet he doesn't waver.  On one side, you have literally the most evil of men and on the other, the most honorable and selfless. There were many such performances in this movie and, again I say, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and the conflict they had to summon to portray the most inconceivable emotion.
In my opinion though, perhaps the most affecting scene was not even scripted film, but as they stood on the very ground in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock where Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg,General Friedrich Olbricht, Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, and Lieutenant Werner von Haeften were unmercifully executed by firing squad under a blanket of darkness lit only by the headlights of the vehicles that idled nearby, Christopher McQuarrie, Bryan Singer and Tom Cruise made short remarks followed by a moment of silence, held out of ""respect for the place (the Bendlerblock) and for the life achievement of the people who were executed there."" (from interview with actor Christian Berkel (Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim).  Queue the Kleenex, please....
I will close with what I believe is an incredibly prophetic exchange that I fear will prove to be remarkable foresight in the end:
  John Connor: ""We're not gonna make it, are we? People, I mean.""

3675831,4,B001KZIRKY,"I take the opportunity to write this review on the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht to pay homage to Germans  whom, at dear expense, stood up to Hitler, trying to stop the triumph of evil.
  Tom Cruise bears a strong resemblance to  the central figure of this film, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who lost significant body parts, including an eye, arm, and a few fingers during combat in Tunisia. Viewers observe his subsequent routine once he is home, having to cope with his physical challenges. Cruise's performance ranges from bland and staid to fairly charismatic. Dutch actress Carice Van Houten, who gave a bravura performance in another World War II era epic, ""Black Book"", plays his wife, Nina.
  By the summer of 1944, the Third Reich was in its last phase of evil that had been far too triumphant.
  With a group of high-ranking officials, who realize ( as most Germans did as early as 1942 by which time there were a few large countries with consequently large armies opposing them)that their country was fighting a losing conflict, including Major general Henning von Tresckow( Kenneth Branagh),Tresckow's aide, played by Tresckow's real-life grandson, Philipp von Schulthess, Colonel Albrecht Ritter(Christian Berkel), General Fredrich Olbricht(Bill Nighy), Colonel General Ludwig Beck(real-life Blitz survivor, Terrence Stamp), Dr. Carl Fredrich Goerdeler(Kevin McNally)who plans to become the new Chancellor after the overthrow,Lieutenant Werner von Haeften(Jamie Parker), General Erich Fellgiebel(Eddie Izzard),Wolf-Henrich Graf von Helldorf(Waldemar Kobus),and Field Marshal Erwin von Wizleben(David Schofield), Stauffenberg, who had initially admired Hitler realizes the need for an end to the madness.
 Each men will donate his skills and military clout to what will be known as the July 20th Plot, the last known plot to kill Hitler(David Bamber), and give Germany an honorable exit from the war. Tom Wilkinson's Colonel General Fredrich Fromm is painted as a more sympathetic character in this movie.
 With his wife and children safe in Switzerland, we watch  Stauffenberg and cohorts enact Operation Valkyrie. Perhaps the thing that has struck me the most was watching one of the secretaries receiving the premature message of Der Fuerher's passing do so with tears in her eyes--a fascinating depiction of someone on the wrong side of history.
 The conspirators have their dealings with those of Hitler's inner circle, including Luftwaffe Commander Herman Goring (Gerhard Haase-Hindenberg),and Albert Speer(Anton Algrang). But it is Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels(Harvey Friedman) who presides over a fateful moment during the incident.
 Viewers are reminded of how the world may have been different had the plot gone as planned. But the vision these brave few had beyond their own mortal lives and grim fates is one for which Mankind must thank them.",1383955200,,2881,5.476297968397291

3675859,5,B001KZIRKY,"""Valkyrie"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In a country in the grips of evil, in a police state where every move is being watched, in a world where justice and honor have been subverted, a group of men hidden inside the highest reaches of power decide to take action. Based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and the daring and ingenious plot to eliminate one of the most evil tyrants the world has ever known.

A proud military man, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is a loyal officer who serves his country all the while hoping that someone will find a way to stop Hitler before Europe and Germany are destroyed. Realizing that time is running out, he decides that he must take action himself and joins the German resistance. Armed with a cunning strategy to use Hitler's own emergency plan - known as Operation Valkyrie - these men plot to assassinate the dictator and overthrow his Nazi government from the inside.

With everything in place, with the future of the world, the fate of millions and the lives of his wife and children hanging in the balance, von Stauffenberg is thrust from being one of many who oppose Hitler to the one who must kill Hitler himself.

The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg) is excellent! The directing by Bryan Singer (who also directed ""Superman Returns"" (2006, also wrote the story and produced), ""X2"" (2003, also wrote the story and executive produced), ""X-Men"" (2000, also wrote the story), & ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995, also produced) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie (also produced) (who also wrote the story and screenplay (which won the Oscar) for ""The Usual Suspects"" and directed and wrote the story and screenplay to ""The Way Of The Gun"" (2000) & Nathan Alexander (also co-produced) is excellent!

The music & film editing by John Ottman (who also did the music & film editing to ""Superman Returns"", ""X2"", & ""The Usual Suspects"", he also did the music to ""Fantastic Four"" (2005) & ""Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" (2007) is excellent! The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who also did the cinematography to ""Superman Returns"", ""X2"", ""X-Men"", & ""The Usual Suspects"") is excellent! The casting by Roger Mussenden (who also did the casting to ""Superman Returns"", ""X2"", & ""X-Men"") is excellent!

The art direction by Jan Jericho, John B. Josselyn (who also did the art direction to ""Thirteen"" (2003), Cornelia Ott, Keith Pain (who also did the art direction to ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) (supervising art director), Ralf Schreck (supervising art director), John Warnke (who also did the art direction to ""Gran Torino"" (2008), & Su Whitaker (who also did the art direction to ""Batman Begins"" (2005) & the upcoming ""Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Bernhard Henrich (who also did the set decoration to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) is excellent! The costume design by Joanna Johnston (who also did the costume design to ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" (2008), ""Munich"" (2005, which was directed by Steven Spielberg), ""War Of The Worlds (2005, which also starred Cruise and directed by Spielberg), ""The Polar Express"" (2004, which starred Tom Hanks and was directed by Robert Zemeckis), ""Love Actually"" (2003), ""About A Boy"" (2002), ""Cast Away"" (2000, which was also directed by Zemeckis and starred Hanks), ""Unbreakable"" (2000, which was directed by M.

This movie is not entirely historically accurate, but what can be realistically expected? It does show the main events that occurred in the final plot to assassinate Hitler.
It's suspenseful, exciting, and even emotional. What will happen? Can they kill Hitler? Can they get Himmler too? What will they do about the SS? It all depends on Operation Valkyrie. . . now under Colonel Stauffenberg's (Tom Cruise) command. . . but can he pull it off?
My only problem is they speak mostly English, with some people having British accents and some with American accents. I know the actors are English speaking so I guess it makes sense. . .

3675873,4,B001KZIRKY,"Based on the true story of the last German plot to assassinate Hitler, 2008's ""Valkyrie"" is an effective World War II crime thriller, although it wasn't actually a crime, of course; it was an act of heroism.

Tom Cruise resembles the protagonist -- Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg -- but he lacks his height. Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some good suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.

The film is both entertaining and educational. It shows that there were thousands of Germans who were willing to risk all to get that monster out of office. And they almost succeeded.

""Valkyrie"" is reminiscent of 1976's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eagle-Has-Landed/dp/B00005QCVP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eagle Has Landed</a>"" in some ways so, if you liked that one, you'll probably appreciate ""Valkyrie.""

3675882,3,B001KZIRKY,"This movie is like the Titanic. You know what happens, ultimately.

The trick in this and the Titanic is to create a little mini-drama among characters for whom you don't know what happens.

So there's some drama about which officers will say yes or no, about minutia like dangers of discovery. And like all good films, there are presented, subtly, several points where if events had gone differently, it would have changed the entire outcome.

So why am I giving this 3 stars?

The movie simply seems to lack in inspiration. It is professional executed, but it seems to lack existential tension. The sets are gorgeous and pristine-- a little too pristine. The characters themselves are too good. They talk about saving the world and so on, voicing noble sentiments that make them unequivocally the good guys. I imagine that if Coppola or Scorsese had done this film, it at least would have delved into Staffenberg's Catholic faith, and more about the huge leap it is to stage a coup against your national leader, even if he is Hitler (Staffenberg in years previous had expressed admiration for Hitler, particularly the conquest of France).

Without the existential tension, you have execution. Execution is fine and good when you don't know what happens, in say a heist job that we know nothing about about. But we know what happens. The coup fails. Hitler lives. Germany goes through further unnecessary destruction and suffering over the next nine months. And so, all we get is a reenactment.",1362009600,,1495,4.893280632411067

3675887,5,B001KZIRKY,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm sure most people know this movie is about the failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler.

The acting was very good throughout. I actually enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance but he did not take the lead as strongly as he should have. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. His role needed that maverick type attitude like he provided in Born On the Fourth of July. His non-German accent was not an issue it was the strength that he displayed in his performance that was disappointing to many. This movie was certainly a chance for him to build his career back up to a more serious level but he clearly did not impress too many people with his role as Stauffenburg to do that. Still, he was enjoyable to watch for me.

The supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were all pivotal in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in perfectly.

The directing of Bryan Singer was superb. He provided an amazing amount of suspense to a movie that everyone knew the ending to. For a good half hour I was totally frozen watching as the plot unfold. I also thought the movie was paced very well and he brought the best out of the supporting cast. Of course it was shot very well with a great production throughout. The movie was written very nicely but as many people have said, it would have been great if there was more emotional depth added to the characters to make the audience feel more attached them.

This movie certainly had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action movie. Valkryie reminded me of a WW2 movie from the 50s and 60s with its style and pacing. It's very interesting to think about what ifs' and its kind of funny to think they almost pulled off the impossible without killing Hitler.

What a wonderful and important story to be told and never forgotten. There are some very strong performances, especially for those that were already familiar with the story so there was no introduction needed when certain characters appeared on the screen. By the way, the casting for Himmler and Goebbels was quite haunting to me...seeing some of the people responsible for some of the worst atrocities ever committed in the 20th century.

3675892,3,B001KZIRKY,"It's in English.

Tom Cruise teases his knowledge of the german language in its first minute or so, but...bam. English fades in.

It's the perfect cast for this account of the last attempt on the life of Adolf Hitler, but...damn it all, it stumbles where it could have shined.

It's certainly a suspenseful feature, and a daring one for an actor like Tom Cruise. It was observed, however, by a YouTube movie reviewer that if a film about a foreign event in war history doesn't at least have its actors attempt the native language...or even has them at least attempt german accents...then it is usually indicative of lazy directing.

I agree with this.

Granted, there are times when it's not necessary. Case in point: the HBO movie ""Conspiracy"" about the Wannsee Conference. THe material was absorbing enough that a necessity for accents or even full-on german dialogue was not necessary.

But you've got Tom Cruise here, and with daring material to boot. And when you have Tom Cruise, you have Hollywood celebrity. And in this case, it works against the film rather than helping it. Cruise does a pretty good job of at least *looking* like Claus Von Stauffenberg, one of the principal figures of the plot to assassinate Hitler, and there are good moments here and there. Case in point: his being asked to salute Friedrich Fromm(Tom Wilkinson) and call out ""Heil Hitler"". He refuses to say it the first time, in his presence...but Fromm demands he say it the second time. He does...but in a clever nod to his less-than-loyal approach to his pure Nazi superiors, he does it with the arm that has no hand(having lost it at the beginning of the film).

But this is a film about crusaders from within the belly of the beast, and something that shows that just because one was german didn't make them a Nazi. With that notion in mind, it would have suited the film to either have the actors speaking in accents, or even full-on German.

3675894,4,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie, 2008 film

This movie is based on a true story, the attempted assassination of Hitler in July 1944. German soldiers swore an oath of unconditional obedience to the Fuehrer. Only death could break it. One man writes about the terrors of Nazi rule. Hitler is the arch-enemy of Germany. Germany is fighting the British in North Africa in 1942 and losing. They are attacked by fighters that drop bombs and shoot at them. The next scene is in 1943 Russian. The Leader meets his Generals. A small package is brought into the conference room. [No inspection of packages.] It failed to go off. Dissenters will be rounded up because of another plot. They will need a replacement for the caught plotter. Mrs. Stauffenberg is told about her husband's wounds. Medals are given to wounded soldiers. Colonel Stauffenberg is recruited to a meeting. What will happen when Hitler is removed? Is there chance of success?

Back home Stauffenberg's family seeks shelter during an air raid. There is an idea to use Operation Valkyrie to take power in Berlin (the reserve troops). They meet General Fromm, he is cautious. Stauffenberg talks to another General: no deal. Stauffenberg is promoted to Chief of Staff of the reserve forces. They visit the mountain retreat of Hitler. The revised plan is browsed and signed. The plotters discuss the time bomb and the need for both Hitler and Himmler to be there. ""Nothing ever goes according to plan."" [The idea is not reality.] Their plan is given to the men, their most important action. A drill is scheduled. Stauffenberg goes to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia. An officer drops a cigarette as a signal. Stauffenberg makes a telephone call to Berlin. It is only a drill! One of the plotters must disappear tonight! Stauffenberg goes to another meeting. They prepare the bomb. The meeting site is changed. There is bad news for the German Army, the Red Army is advancing. Stauffenberg gets a telephone call and walks away. There is an explosion. [Does his departure provide a clue? Better to have stayed close by?]

An officer calls Berlin, communications are severed. The General hesitates to implement the plan without knowing that Hitler is dead. The Standby Drill is ordered, but later than planned. Operation Walkre is ordered, the orders passed along. Fromm places a telephone call and learns Hitler survived. The Berlin Ministry is sealed. The police will cooperate. Soldiers take over government buildings. All seems to be going well. But new orders come from Hitler! Goebbels makes a telephone call, the traitors are to be taken alive. Generals make a decision to be on the winning side. One man says ""the Fuehrer is not dead"". Operation Walkre is ended. The radio sens out the news. The coup failed. [In Norse mythology the Walkre were beautiful maidens who accompanied dead warriors to Valhalla for celebrations.]

Troops arrive to arrest the plotters by orders of the Fuehrer. Beck asks for a pistol. The others are tried for treason. Some are shot, the others are hanged. ""The July 20 plot was the last of 15 known attempts by Germans to assassinate Hitler. Nine months later, with Berlin surrounded, Hitler committed suicide."" [What if they used a more powerful bomb?] The book ""Counterfeit Traitor"" said there would be no need for the Gestapo and concentration camps if all the Germans supported Hitler. The Allies signed a treaty that called for unconditional surrender so a successful coup would not have changed the post-war world. Germany would still have been partitioned into zones of influence. Would the war in Asia have ended sooner? The secret protocol of the Yalta Agreement called for the Soviet Union to renounce its peace treaty with Japan and attack 90 days after the end of the European war. The war could have ended in 1944 without the use of an atomic bomb (which would be developed anyway). The civil war in China would have continued. The war for independence in Vietnam (and elsewhere) would have started. You would learn more from a good history book than this movie.",1356912000,,4046,4.919472913616398

We all know that despite the attempts on his life, Hitler took his own life when he realized that his defeat was imminent. Knowing the outcome of this film doesn't make it any less entertaining.

Some of those people were even willing to sacrifice all to overthrow the tyrant.  It really makes one think how different things would have been if one of these attempts had been successful.

The movie itself is compelling.  I struggled to follow some of the flow, so I had to drop everything to watch the movie (I usually watch movies in the background).  My daughter was introduced to this film in her German class, so she really wanted to see it.

The production values are excellent. The direction is excellent. The actors are all universally excellent. Unless, of course, you believe they should all be speaking German, or at least have a German accent. I don't mind that at all. I mean the film Thirteen Days was a terrific film but what detracted was Costner's attempts at the Boston accent. There was no need for it. And none here.

Cruise is decent, as usual, as the hero colonel who tries to plant a bomb. The real bomb did go off, injuring many there, but Hitler miraculously did escape unharmed. The tension of this film mounts as we wonder if the plotters will succeed, though we know, of course, that they did not. That's ultimately what's wrong here, of course. We know the outcome all along. This all-star cast is a throw-back to similar WW2 epics made by Hollywood in the 60s and 70s. I found the Hitler here a little too unconvincing.

Metaxas explains how, after numerous starts and stops, the code-named plot ""Valkyrie"" went forward:

* ""It was hopeless to look for anything from the Allies, but they came to the conclusion that this no longer mattered. Now it was simply about doing the right thing, come what may....The final and famous July 20 plot would be led by Stauffenberg, a devout Catholic....it was a vast conspiracy of Gemany's elites....The New York Times declared that those who attempted `to kidnap or kill the head of the German state and commander in chief of the Army' had done something one would not `normally expect within an officers' corp and a civilized government.' And Winston Churchill, who had done his best to starve the conspiracy to death, now kicked its corpse, calling the attempt a case of ""the highest personalities in the German Reich murdering one another"" (pp. 476 - 483).

While Dietrich Bonhoeffer was not directly involved in Valkyrie, the failure of the plot set in motion the chain of events which led to Bonhoeffer's arrest and eventual execution.",1327968000,,1371,5.8793969849246235

Still, I would have to admit that this movie, even with him it, is a success. It places you right back in Germany amongst individuals who were serving in the military but hated the man who they knew would ruin their country. It is a group of people who feel the utmost responsibility to their county, but know they will pay the ultimate price for fulfilling it. You'll see the considerations that weigh upon them and what they do about them. All the while the movie moves crisply along and is never boring. A very good movie, get it and enjoy.",1327536000,,687,4.292307692307692
3675915,5,B001KZIRKY,"This is a story that needed to be told.  It was gratifying to learn that at least some German leaders had the courage to try to right a horrible situation even at the risk of their own lives.

3675916,3,B001KZIRKY,"The plot to kill Hitler. This is a well documented true story. But I have to say that I felt sick at my stomach watching this film. The entire movie was set up to feature Tom Cruise (who I really enjoy as an actor), but in doing so, lost much of its credibility. I am a huge WW2 history fan, and so I watched this with an open mind.

Though the events are more or less accurate, the execution here fails. Compared with a film such as Downfall, this is trash. I'm sorry if you disagree, but if you are rating this five stars and haven't seen Downfall, you need to do so immediately.

The acting is probably the worst thing about this film. I am appalled that the film was in English (so they could feature American actors) and I am sure if it had been in German it wouldn't have raked in a lot of cash. So I don't really blame the producers there. But could we have at least TRIED to have the actors playing Germans actually affect a German accent? Would that be too much to ask? Mel Gibson affected a Scottish accent for Braveheart... even Tom Cruise affected an Irish accent for Far and Away. Perhaps the director and producers felt that having Tom Cruise as the top billed actor could convince people to ignore some of these issues.

The other problem I have is that the film just didn't really seem to be all that interesting. The National Geographic documentary ""42 Ways to Kill Hitler"" was hands down more interesting than this film.

The only kudos I give are to the good performances from a few key actors and the beautiful and accurate set designs. I just felt the film lacked continuity. Project Valkyrie was an amazing effort by Germans to assassinate a despot whom they felt would bring Germany crashing down... though the plot very nearly succeeded, alas, as we all know, it failed. I will say that the final scenes were 100% spot on accurate to what I have seen on documentaries and read about. So I give three stars.

For a real look into these plots check out: 42 Ways to Kill Hitler. Or check out my favorite WW2 film depicting the German side of things: Downfall [DVD]. Just watch this film with an open mind, and take everything in with a grain of salt. As I did.",1323820800,,2181,4.348894348894349

Claus von Stauffenberg final days and his attempt, with the help of various conspirators, both civilians, and from the German  military, to kill Adolf Hitler.  The plot of course failed, and that precisely, gives the movie its tragic overtones. This movie as you can read in other reviews had not been well liked by the public.  In this review I will like to answer why.
1. This is not the typical commercial film the general public is accostumed to watch, at the contrary, it resembles movies that were made about World War II during the Sixties.
2. The other thing is that Tom Cruise really wanted to play Colonel Von Strauffenberg as a tribute to him for being part of the German Resistance, a fact that it is not well known.
3. It is not the first time that Cruise had play a crippled war veteran; does anyone remember Born on the Fourth of July, an Oliver Stone film?
4. The importance of communications in The Third Reich regime: the typewriting scenes are superb.
5. This movie looks more to a biopic than to a traditional film.
6. If you watch this movie you should pay attention to details: the actors who played General Fromm's staff do have much credibility!  I did love the woman who plays the Colonel's assistant and actor Christian Berkel as Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim.

Looking at a historical movie should be different than looking at a ""Star Wars"" or ""Jaws"" type movie. A historical movie should be historically accurate and ""Valkyrie"" does a very good job of presenting and not altering the facts and great credit is deserved for that.
Besides being truthful, the event should be historically significant and be entertaining and ""Valkyrie"" again scores here. Most of the cast is very good in their roles and Tom Cruise is in it also - he's actuallyfairly decent here. Some people prefer a movie like"" Inglorious Bastards"" that is pure fantasy that never happened - I'd rather see a truthful account like this. 4.5 Stars.",1314489600,,856,4.86986301369863
3675926,4,B001KZIRKY,"I wrote a review of this movie shortly after it came out. Re-watching the movie on TV last night reminded me of the strengths (many)  and weaknesses (very few) of this film. It also reminded me of many of the off-kilter reviews posted on Amazon, one of which was the portrayal of Hitler by David Bamberg.  Most of the negative reviews seem to think he played Hitler too much as an exhausted and distracted, worn out rag doll. How could the ruler of Nazi Germany get away with being such a weakling?  A 'cariacture' as one reviewer wrote. Let's put this to rest once and for all.  In 1970 I spent two hours with Albert Speer ( Hitler's minister of armaments) at his home in Heidleberg.  Speer had just released his memoirs,  'Inside the Third Reich'.  Naturally, during my conversation I asked him about Hitler, especially during the latter part of the war.  His description of Hitler ( and who would know better?) was exactly the way Bamberg portrayed him. Exactly.  This is substantiated by the numerous memoirs and autobiographies of others who knew Hitler at that time. It's easily verifiable by watching films and photographs of Hitler taken in mid/late 1944. Therefore it's clear to me that  Bamberg, the director and the film's historians had done thorough research in planning the portrayal for shooting. They most certainly had read Speer's book.

3675927,1,B001KZIRKY,"Unintentional comedy is off the charts in this one. The trailer where Tom Cruise says the classic line ""Operation Valkyrie is in effect"" is not only said once but twice in this flick. Surrounded by a bevy of great Brit actors (Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, etc.) who chew up the scenes, this movie is still a total mess. Having Cruise act with a patch over his eye and a missing hand was not up there with Jack Nicholson with his sliced nose in Chinatown in the annals of great acting while having a movie inspired disfigurement.

If you know anything about WWII history it's also laughable how much they twist for movie suspense. I actually thought the movie started off well with the Afrika Korps scene but after that it became mostly a movie about shuffling papers and getting them signed followed by the plot to kill Adolph Hitler. They could have chopped about 30 minutes off this movie and made a half-decent watchable motion picture.

3675930,5,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie is absolutely amazing.  One of the best thrillers of all time.  I have no idea why it only has gotten an average of four stars.  It seems to me that people have judged it too harshly because they were prepared not to like it from the negative media reviews or just don't like Cruise in general. There is one review here where the guy said Valkyrie was his fourth favorite movie of all time, and then gave it four stars, not five!

I like Cruise, but am not a raving fan.  I do actually think Cruise really was the best actor for the job.  Cruise v. Hitler- come on it does sound cool, right?!  Cruise expectedly played him in a straight-ahead, self-confident, ultra- officer and a gentleman way.  But that was exactly appropriate- von Stauffenberg was a teutonic ubermensch in the very best sense.  He refused morphine when he was in the hospital for his horrific wounds. He was a wealthy nobelman- he could have ridden out the rest of the war at a cushy colonel desk job.  But he chose to put himself and family in the worst possible jeopardy by trying to kill Hitler.

The film was historically accurate, visually pleasing, well acted, extremely thrilling and inspirational.  I couldn't have asked for anything more.",1308355200,3,1227,4.6036866359447
3675931,1,B001KZIRKY,"I wanted to like this, but I failed.

The story has the makings of a good movie: betrayal, disillusion, suspense, triumph, failure, danger.

But ""Valkyrie"" makes them all dull.

This is a shame.

The acting is brilliant: Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy are all wonderful.  Even Cruise is OK.  But even the wonderful Carice van Houten can't breathe life into this slow-paced bomb.

And the visuals are great: the uniforms, the buildings, the equipment are all first-rate.

But that's it.

The writing is deplorable, and the directing is worse.  Far too many scenes are just people talking, sometimes walking while talking, by way of explication.  Far better to SHOW what's going on than to just tell.

For example, the opening scene shows Cruise in North Africa writing in his journal about his disillusionment with Hitler.  Cruise's German is actually not bad (it fades into English), but why just STATE these things?  Why not add some scenes that graphically illustrate them?

The whole movie is like that.

A big expensive snore.  Too bad.

By the way, for a WWII movie that does it right, see ""The Black Book"" with Carice van Houten.",1304553600,5,1147,4.885416666666667
3675932,4,B001KZIRKY,"A good film about the Von Stauffenberg plot, the conspiracy that almost succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler during the later stages of World War II. It doesn't start very promisingly: things happen fast (we have Von Stauffenberg severely injured in a battle in North Africa, losing an arm, three fingers and an eye, and a few minutes later we have him joining the conspiracy, without explaining very well his motivations) and characters are introduced hastily without explaining well who they are. But as the movie progresses and we get into the plot itself (which was more than about killing the Fuhrer; knowing that that wouldn't be enough to end Germany's dreadful situation, they also have a complicated plan to take power and be able to sue the allies for peace in terms that would not be disastrous for Germany), it gets more and more gripping with a superb final hour. The mostly British cast here (among them, Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy), acquit themselves very well. Tom Cruise, however, while not a disaster, is just not very believable as a German officer. Besides his limited acting range, his demeanor has always been very American, so he is just not very believable playing people from other countries. I can think of other actors who could have been great in this role: for example, Thomas Kretschmann, who plays a Major who has a key role in breaking the coup attempt, could have been a great Von Stauffenberg. Still, this was better than expected as director Bryan Singer (of the X-Men franchise) certainly knows how to make a gripping, entertaining movie.

This movie is not about good acting but rather an excellent war and historical based movie that sheds light on another reality of world war 2-the defectors. It is interesting to delve deeper into the German lines in the heat of a war and see what really may have went on. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time worrying about the colonel, his wife, and everyone. I have watched it several times and it stills grips me with the same ferocity every time. I gave it a four out of five only because this is not graded on the scale of movies based on acting but intense emotion.",1298073600,,716,4.195652173913044

3675935,5,B001KZIRKY,"I have never really been a fan of war films or movies that depicted a story with a war element to it, so I purchased ""Valkyrie"" due to the fact that I am a true Tom Cruise fan. The movie details the true story of a former soldier (Cruise) of Hitler's that defects the maniacal Nazi to try an kill him in an attempt to bring piece and prosterity to Germany.

 I had a hard time following the film as I didn't really understand the plot of the picture, but upon a second viewing I understood completely the action of the film and its characters.

 Terence Stamp (mostly known to me as a drag queen in 1994's ""Pricilla, Queen of the Desert"") gives a great supporting performance as one of the men who helps to bring down Hitler, and Cruise's role is heart-breaking and touching as a man who is scrarred both physically and emotionally from fighting in the war. However, it is David Bamber, who plays Hitler, who gives the performance of a lifetime. His mannerisms and chilling facial look is almost chilling in that he resembles the evil leader to the letter.

 Despite what many have said ""Valkyrie"" was a huge financial success grossing over $200,000,000 at the worldwide box office.",1296604800,2,1182,4.525821596244131
3675936,4,B001KZIRKY,"Near perfect effort here in my opinion. The suspense never really lets up once it gets rolling. The movie is based on one of the most well known plots to assassinate Adolf Hitler near the close of WWII in Europe. The movie successfully argues that not all Germans were content to allow the Nazi party to continue their crimes against humanity. Given the subject of the movie and the suspenseful pacing it is not relaxing or overly re-watchable, but at the sale price it is well worth adding to your movie collection.

And to date, of the 5 or 6 films concerning this event, this film is the best.  Where possible, they used actual locations, even some interiors.  And the actors behaved like German officers, further giving it the feel of authenticity.",1294617600,,294,4.82
3675938,5,B001KZIRKY,"Like most people, I learned of the most famous near-miss assassination plot on Hitler in high school history class.  I knew the story about how the briefcase with the bomb was randomly pushed behind a stanchion which held up the table ~ thus (inadvertently) saving Hitler's life.  Like most people, that's all that I knew about the plot, other than that fact that a great many Nazis (including the legendary ""DESERT FOX"" Erwin Rommell) were rounded up & executed.

I found this film to be quite illuminating as it elaborated on the grand-plot to not only whack Hitler but also to take control of Berlin and (eventually) the entire German military force.  The plan was quite ingenious;  to mobilize the Berlin reserve forces (kind of like Hitler's very own private National Guard) to impose order under the false-pretenses that the Gestapo was guilty of regicide.

While the plot ultimately failed, I never knew just how close they came to succeding ~ not just in killing Hitler but also in overthrowing Hitler's government.  I suspect most people who see this movie will be as surprised as I was.

This is what I like to refer to as an unconventional war movie in that it deals with a subplot of a war rather than a battle or a military leader.  As such, it is a superb bit of history.  And, of course, it's always refreshing to see a movie where the Gestapo are bullied & pushed around.  Wagner would be proud!",1294617600,2,1411,4.626506024096385
3675939,4,B001KZIRKY,"I've never been a big Tom Cruise fan, I've always thought him to be a rather obnoxious character.  I saw this film on blu-ray recently and thought it to be an intelligent and suspenseful film that was much better than expected.  Based on the true attempt to assasinate Hitler on July 20th 1944, this film goes into great detail on the specifics of the plot.  (I've always thought that it was basically an attempt to kill Hitler.  However there was a much more complicated plot to take over the govenment once the madman was killed, which unfortunately he was not.)  The sad ends to those who participated are shown in detail.  Cruise is quite good and is surrounded by an excellent British cast including Terrence Stamp.  The production values are excellent and it is well directed by Bryan Singer (whose name seems to have become a dirty word in Hollywood since the failure of ""Superman Returns.""  This film only did moderate business as well.)
There are numerous special features but the high point is an almost 2 hour documentary on the actual plot, which includes interviews with some of the widows, children and grandchildren of the participants, who were all quickly executed after the plot's failure.  This documentary is excellent and a very nice bonus.  The picture and sound quality on the blu-ray are excellent.
If you did not see this film and like a well-made WWII film about an event that actually occured, then I recommend that you see this film.  You won't be disappointed.",1293840000,,1489,4.77734375
3675940,3,B001KZIRKY,"Although some saw Tom Cruise's last film as a possible propaganda vehicle, it's tempting to look upon it more as a cry for help. After seeing him playing a man so increasingly disillusioned with the insane control-freak tendencies of the personality cult that has taken control of every aspect of its followers lives and sets out to destroy all who disagree with it that he becomes part of a doomed plot to kill its leader, David Miscavige probably made sure the security was trebled next time Cruise visited the compound.

Valkyrie is one of those films that's neither the disaster many were hoping for nor quite as good as it could have been, never quite veering to either side as it all too steadily ploughs its course through another retelling of the failed July Plot to assassinate Hitler. If there are no real lows there are also, sadly, precious few highs, the film retelling events efficiently but never really gripping as tightly as it should and only briefly engaging the emotions in the final scenes, and those you suspect more for the fate of the real people involved than those onscreen. It's a noble effort, but it's hard to resist comparing it to the failed assassination attempt: it makes a big noise but it doesn't quite hit the target.

Originally intended as a lower-budget directorial outing for co-writer Christopher McQuarrie and German actor Thomas Kretschman, who gets a fairly thankless supporting role as consolation, it's certainly a big improvement on eventual director Bryan Singer's ponderous take on Superman, but despite marshalling some impressive resources thanks to Tom Cruise's involvement, it never quite grasps the epic enormity of its subject: the first half is less a desperate attempt to pull back from the brink of destruction than a series of measured conversations in rooms and offices. Despite some flat one-dimensional characterisation, it doesn't entirely idealise its conspirators - as one unwilling recruit blackmailed into co-operating tells them, they're like rats deserting a sinking ship who may be no better than the people they want to replace - but it's only when their plan starts to go wrong thanks to stalling, indecision and plain bad luck that the film starts to take hold. Multi-tasking editor/composer/co-executive producer John Ottman's score could have given the film more help at times, but only really comes into its own in the end credits. It's a worthy effort, and not nearly as bad as that word now implies, with some good supporting performances from Tom Wilkinson, Christian Berkel, Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp (though Carice van Houten is wasted as Cruise's wife): it just needed to be that bit more forceful and direct to really fulfil its promise.

As is increasingly common, the DVD edition stints on the extras - even the documentary is a cutdown version of the one included on the BluRay.",1292716800,,2872,5.016771488469602

3675943,2,B001KZIRKY,"Many other reviewers are singing the praises of this quasi-historically-accurate thriller.  Although the plot is insightful and hits the key elements of this assassination attempt on Hitler, it misses the underlying historical point.  The Wehrmacht leadership was divided into two organizational components by this point in the war.  Not surprisingly, it was Hitler, the dictator of Nazi Germany, who made this organizational ""adjustment"" early in the war due to his distrust of the existing mechanisms of promotion and the questionable loyalty of the pre-1939 German Army leadership.  He installed his puppet officers, those he could control, in the OKW or the OberKommand der Wehrmacht, in violation of the long-standing tradition of the Army to be independent of political control.  This destruction of longstanding (since 1807) German Army organizational principles caused a great reaction among the 'purists' within the junior and senior officer corps, culminating in this final attempt to kill Hitler and, all of his cronies in the OKW.  Notably, most of the conspirators were these same Army purists who put devotion to the Army and pre-1939 Germany above personal considerations and Hitler's blandishments.  Only by assassination could the Army rid itself of both the menace of Hitler, whose strategic direction had failed, and the OKW patsies.  The goal was to save Germany through negotiated surrender with the Allies, with the Army representing the people of Germany.  That this attempt failed meant that Germany soon became partitioned by the Allies and that the German people were subjected to even further atrocities under the various English, French, US and Russian occupation 'governments'.

A subtext of the movie relates to the activation of ""Code Valkyrie"".  Valkyrie was a German Army plan, signed by Hitler, intended to protect the upper level Nazi leadership (such as Hitler, Goebbels & Goering) against existing internal threats or counter-coups, now that the war itself was lost.  It made use of the Army Reserve to protect key infrastructure and leadership, while operating to arrest or decapitate rival claimants to the dictatorship.  What seems to be missed in the movie is Hitler's obsession (not with Goebbels) but with Himmler, the leader of the SS.  It was Himmler that Code Valkyrie was directed against, because Himmler was the most likely candidate to assume power and authority given the far-reaching tentacles of the SS and the natural antipathy that arose between Hitler and Himmler, the men holding the most raw state power.  Historians have not yet unraveled the linkage between Stauffenberg's preemptive activation of the Valkyrie plan and the dire threat that Himmler & the SS posed to Hitler's form of governing in the closing days of WW II.  In fact, almost to confirm this fact and Hitler's obsession, it was Himmler that eventually proclaimed himself dictator after Hitler was confined within his Berlin bunker, whereupon Hitler placed him under sentence of death for overreach of authority.",1290124800,5,3036,5.3466386554621845

3675946,2,B001KZIRKY,"""Valkyrie"" is a movie made for Tom Cruise fans.  It never takes off, and has a very slow pace.  Cruise plays the lead as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, famous for trying to assassinate Hitler and bring WWII to a quick end.  However hard Cruise tries, he just does not grab the viewer as the character.  It is Tom Cruise dressed up in period costumes and just saying his lines.  The scenes look authentic but Cruise does not.

""Valkyrie"" is the name of Hitler's strategic emergency plan that a group of high ranking Germans use as part of their plot to assassinate the evil dictator and take over the Nazi government from inside.  The future of the world is at stake, and so is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's wife and children.

It is based on a true story, but there does not seem to be enough material for a full-length movie.",1286496000,,830,4.486666666666666
3675947,5,B001KZIRKY,"OH NO, this movie is SUBTITLED! Or so I thought--the beginning narration was in German audio with subtitles, well, being too lazy to learn German and since I really don't WATCH movies but largely LISTEN to them while doing something else, the DVD was about to go back into its sleeve.  However, the German quickly transitioned into English and I was happy, my DVD ejection fingers snagged a Cheeto instead.

The July 20th Bomb Plot aftermath led to the arrest of at least 7,000 people by the Gestapo.with at least 4,980 people executed.  Since many of these were high ranking individuals, a surgical strike as suggested by the ""Dirty Dozen"" other war movies or even actual  Allied actual operations could not have done better than what an irate Hitler did against his own people.  Among the casualties was Erwin Rommel of ""Desert Fox"" fame.  With it ended the resistance movement in Germany.

Though the movie does not mention Erwin, historically he played a much smaller role in the resistance than I originally thought. Nevertheless, after Schindler's List and a few others publicizing the crimes and atrocities of that country, a film dramatizing this little known event of the Reich does Germany a service.  Not all Germans were memorized by Adolf's promises, but, regrettably, it was their dumb luck all 15 of their attempts failed.  Note to self-- ""stay away from assassination plots against Hitler.""

For an army corporal to take power and have afraid even Field Marshals is certainly remarkable in and of itself.  But it is this very same corporal even today whose name is reached for when someone seems to become too difficult to deal with ""Your just HITLER,"" or ""you're just like HITLER.""  Adolf had succeeded in creating a pervasive ""Cult of Personality "" around him that far exceeded his physical prowess and reaches across time.  When Col. Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg bomb plot neared, Hitler began to suffer very visibly from physical aliments.

The movie portrays well the weak and sickly Adolf, but I do not feel entirely convinced of this ""Cult of Personality"" the intensity of charisma Hitler emanated.  Certainly the actors/ characters  responded as in the telephone scene with Goebbels, to an Adolf who was very much in charge.

With Generals in the resistance, one may ask, ""how it is it the Colonel is so influential?""  Historically, the Colonel's strong moral convictions (he was a Catholic) and transfer of key leaders motivated the resistance to take more decisive action.  I got the impression though some of this is contrived, ""ok Hitler got us THIS far, but now that we're losing, the crimes, the dead bodies, yeah THAT's it.""he HAS to GO...""

But historically, the Colonel had sincere convictions that caused him to question the German cause from 1942 at least.  One may wonder why this late date, but in a totalitarian society where no one is allowed to own a cell phone and internet access denied , it might take awhile before word gets around.  It is easy to see why Tom Cruise took the role of the Colonel.. He played center role  with many of the scenes revolving around him, but so did the actual Colonel in the real bomb plot of July 20th .

Once things go bad and Hitler emerges with a few cuts and bruises (when reading about the other plots as well as this one, there can be little doubt that the man is uncannily lucky) death precedes him.  Millions more die in the war as well the 4,980 people executed as the result of the failed attempt. One might wonder, gee God, briefcase just a little bit to to the other side of that table leg, or ComeON God, make the weather a little cooler so they use the BUNKER as planned by the co-conspirators or WTF Colonel, they gave you TWO explosive charges!!!

Still, Hitler was not an immovable force, he could have gotten a clue, changed his ways...maybe even apologized.

Joachim von Ribbentrop's  statement  at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 after Hitler popped himself and the Russians pinched his jawbone: ""Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it.""

See this movie!!!

3675948,5,B001KZIRKY,"Let me begin by saying that I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. On the contrary, I despise the guy and try to avoid many of his films. Having said this, let me eat my big helping of crow and admit what a brilliant job he did as Claus von Stauffenberg in Bryan Singer's film about the plot to kill Hitler. Cruise was my only caveat here, as I like Singer's work and that of the screenwriter, Christopher McQuarrie, the same duo who brought us the absolutely brilliant The Usual Suspects. The strong point of the movie is the adherence to facts; one does not need to embellish the story with fictional additions - it speaks for itself. Cruise is quietly understated as von Stauffenberg, the disenchanted colonel who placed the bomb under Hitler's table. Also the fact that cruise bears a good passing resemblance to von Stauffenberg helps the viewer buy into the story.

3675951,5,B001KZIRKY,"The war was not turning out the way that the German military officials had thought it would. Some of them were thinking of ways of persuading Hitler to end it or, failing that, to assassinate him, take control, and try for a negotiated settlement with the Allies.

Stauffenberg sent out feelers to other German officials, and found some potential supporters. The plot was hatched. The attempt was to be made at a meeting located in Wolf's Lair, in East Prussia. Unfortunately, owing to the hot weather, the meeting had been moved from the concrete bunker to a wooden hut, greatly reducing the effects of the explosion. Also, for some reason, only one of the blocks of plastic explosive was used instead of the two that were available.

In the meeting, Stauffenberg got next to Hitler, planted the bomb, and left. Stauffenberg saw the explosion with his own eyes. Surely Hitler was dead. Stauffenberg got past the checkpoints, and flew to Berlin to start the revolt. Confusion reigned. German officials did not know whose side to take. Contradictory arrest orders were given. Who to believe and obey?

Then all the phone lines to Stauffenberg's office were cut. Stauffenberg was arrested after a shootout. Hitler came on the radio and announced that he was very much alive. The plotters' fate was sealed.

Although this movie has much drama and entertainment value, some parts have questionable accuracy. Did Stauffenberg, while participating in the North African campaign, actually take the risk of putting his misgivings about Hitler in writing? The movie doesn't point out that most of the conspirators remained Nazis. Considering all the atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht, were the Wehrmacht officers actually disgusted by the atrocities of the SS? Was Goebbels actually prepared to commit suicide had the plotters succeeded? And so on...

Still, this is a very good film. It even has a poignant scene: Two of Stauffenberg's young sons playing with swords while Wagner's VALKYRIE is playing on the then-primitive record player. Also, Stauffenberg's daughter dons his officers' hat.",1283040000,4,2088,5.147492625368732

3675955,5,B001KZIRKY,"Surprising because Tom Cruise apparently took some critical knocks but, here, they aren't warranted. Cruise, in an unexpectedly effective turn from the kind of work with which he is most associated, comes up with an effective and even convincing performance as the Nazi-era German Col. Claus von Stauffenberg who directs an attempt to save literally all of Eurpoe by killing his boss - his Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler. Based on actual events that came to a head July 20, 1944, when a bomb that was planted with Hitler standing only feet away failed to hit its target, Valkyrie was the German code name of the operation to be implemented to keep Hitler's Germany on the Fuhrer's course in the event of his death. The plot, the last known of 15 attempts by German resistant forces to kill Hitler and his vision for the country, is arguably the best known to history as cited in memorials throughout Berlin honoring the lives of the conspirators. This film version, incredibly well acted with a stellar cast that includes Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh and the always-superb Tom Wilkinson, comes across with passion, compassion, historic accuracy and a sense of respect for those German military men who snubbed their loyalty oath to Hitler in an attempt to close what they saw even then to be one of the darkest chapters in human history. The film didn't slay any giants at the box office or come close to blockbuster status. That's a shame, if for no other reason than the historic importance of the film didn't hit a mass audience. The film deserved a better commerical showing, and perhaps it will find its just due in the home DVD market. Also unfortunate is the critical slam Cruise was dealt; it isn't justified. Literally within weeks of the failed July 20 plot, most of its architects were executed; ironically, just nine months later, with Berlin surounded by the Red Army and the threat of other Allied forces nearing, Hitler committed suicide. The viewer who is unfamiliar with the history of the event probably will not fully appreciate the film's purpose and message, but so it goes with any other movie based on historic events. This film is too important to be missed if for no other reason than to show that not all the men and women in Hitler's regime shared the evil that cloaked their Fuhrer.",1280275200,2,2303,4.774436090225564

All the actors in this movie are first rate, especially the simpering Wilkerson.  Maybe it was because I knew how this movie would end that I found it so hard to watch, I kept getting up and leaving the room, it's tragic beyond belief the true ending of this movie.  When you think of all the lives that could have been spared had it ended differently.  This is a very sobering movie and not for the faint at heart.  Having said that, I recommend this movie, for not only it's riviting pace, but also for its lesson in altruism.",1279929600,,672,4.170542635658915
3675957,4,B001KZIRKY,"What makes this movie so exciting, tense and moving, is that it is based upon true history.  And Cruise's portrayal of Von Stauffenberg is definitely compelling.  It's more engaging than 90% of the Hollywood fictional trash out there, because YOU KNOW that the conspirators are standing up to a huge, dark, powerful Beast (Hitler's Killing Machine), and that they are going to fail & die in the end.

BUT they nearly did it!  A recent scientific examination said that Hitler would have died if (1) the briefcase bomb wasn't moved accidentally, (2) two charges were used, as planned, not just one, or (3) the meeting was in the bunker, not the conference house.  So Von Stauffenberg and co-conspirators came VERY, VERY CLOSE to killing Hitler.  One might wonder if God was ""looking"" down at the time, why didn't he just ""tweak"" the physics 0.01% to cause Hitler to die?  This would have saved literally millions of lives that perished in the last year of the European theater of WWII.  It's the Butterfly effect -- a small error, a slightly small charge in the bomb, a wiff of air, caused Hitler to survive, and in surviving, a massive change in history resulted.  It has lots of philosophical implications.

Many PC-types might not like this movie because they want to think of the entire German population in WWII as evil..... well, they're wrong.  It's heart-wrenching and compelling to think that courageous men like Von Stauffenberg willingly gave their lives to try to kill Hitler and put into place the Valkyrie plan, in order to try to save their country from the Nazi barbarians.  The plan was BRILLIANT, and would have worked!  They had planned to blame the SS and seize control of Berlin with the Reserve troops -- it was all working except for the little unfortunate fact that HITLER DIDN'T DIE.

Oh, yes, the movie.  Lots of tense scenes.  Particularly when he's getting Hitler himself to sign the amended copy of Valkyrie, and of course leading up to the bomb blast.  Lots of steely resolve and appropriate acting by Cruise.  Excellent supporting acting ensemble (like Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschman).  Some very memorable scenes ... Kretschman's character picking up the phone while Goebbels waits, ready to kill himself, only to see Kretschman stiffen and freak out when he hears the supposedly dead Hitler on the phone.  Another: Cruise being forced to give the Nazi salute, and then doing so, saying ""Heil Hitler"" while saluting with his right arm (which is missing a hand from war wounds!!) -- Shocking, compelling, touching.

The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.

I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.

VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00000F214/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>).

Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Collateral/dp/B003498SDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Collateral</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B0035WTJFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...

What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.

It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.

If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a clich here in that ""I was on the edge of my seat"" throughout the second half of the film.

So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",1274572800,5,3282,5.43418467583497
3675960,4,B001KZIRKY,"OK, first of all, let me admit right from the beginning that I despise Tom Cruise. Nevertheless, I went to see the movie, excpecting a typical Hollywood dismemberment of history. True, it had some relatively minor historical points that were absent or wrong, but these were minor. It was a good effort, overall, but all the different accents were annoying. From my viewpoint, the best part was at the very end, when the film simply points out that Valkyrie was the 17th attempt by the German people to kill the dictator. I suspect that this may be part of why some people dislike the movie; they prefer to think of all Germans as being inherently Nazis and we forget that there were a large number of people who had avoided being brainwashed by the propaganda and detested the Nazis.",1274313600,,783,4.640287769784172
3675961,5,B001KZIRKY,"A wonder look at the July 20, 1944 plot to kill Hitler. This shows that Germany wasn't all Nazis and there were Germans who understood the evil of Hitler.  A must see for military history buffs.",1273795200,,194,4.388888888888889
3675962,5,B001KZIRKY,"The best laid plans are still subject to accident, coincidence, and unforeseen challenges. That is certainly a theme of the excellent film Valkyrie. Tom Cruise plays a heroic and noble figure, brave and fully in the right, and yet tragically fails in his mission against evil forces purely due to accident and coincidence. The maturity of this theme elevates this film beyond a World War II suspense film. The good guys lose, which is often the case in the real world. Yet even though anyone who knows the least about history knows the end of the film before it begins, the film makers were able to create an entertaining suspenseful movie that kept me hoping that the good guys would be able to pull off a stunt that would have saved over a million lives.  Tom Cruise does an a great job and fully demonstrates that he can play mature middle aged men grappling with conflict. Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a key player in the assassination attempt, and noble risk taker. The entire cast is superb and even though there are multiple levels of military and political ranks to navigate, the film does this effortlessly so we are clear about good guys, bad guys, and ambivalent guys. The film has a grand old European feel as interior shots are perfectly appointed and exterior shots have a golden glow. In the end the film appears to have been a highly accurate portrayal of actual historic events and characters, played realistically. A tragic event unfolds in a careful and suspenseful manner before our eyes and we are left with feelings of sadness for a future that never happened and respect for the bravery of the men involved.",1273622400,,1650,4.729166666666667

However, if I'd just watched a documentary about this incident just days before I wouldn't have had a clue what this was about. What happened to elocution in movies? Cruise and his co-stars speak so low that you can't even hear what's being said. If you raise the volume, you get blown out of your chair with the music cues or background sounds. This movie was well-acted, not including the speech issues. It also gave a face to the millions of Germans who were not in agreement with Hitler's atrocities.

Cruise plays a military officer who forms a group of generals / politicans intent on killing Hitler, for the good of Germany.  They realize that Germany has become a dictatorship, and want a return to a representative government.  They have a ""plan"" to do so, and plot involves them carrying out that plan.

Good supporting acting from Kenneth Branaugh and Terrence Stamp add dramatic intensity and weight to the film. The actor who plays Hitler also does a fine job.",1271030400,,700,4.650406504065041
3675965,5,B001KZIRKY,"The movie is excellent! It clearly reveals the story of how many Germans, from low positions of power to those highly ranked in the military, were against Hitler. The common misconception is that all of Germany was for Hitler, but that is NOT true. Many Germans wanted Hitler dead and his totalitarian ways removed.",1269907200,,315,4.851851851851852
3675966,5,B001KZIRKY,"I had first heard this story back in the 1960s as a high school student, told to me by my Dad, who is a WW2 veteran. He knew all about it and told me to check it out in the history books. He was one of the soldiers, an Army Ranger in C Company, that landed on Normandy Beach in France at D-Day, June 6, 1944. He told me that if Col. von Stauffenberg had succeeded in his plot to assassinate Hitler only six weeks later, the war would have been over by the end of July, and General Patton would not have had to start the winter offensive called the Battle of the Bulge. He said he personally would have wanted to shake the hand of Col. von Stauffenberg (the character portrayed so well by Tom Cruise). As it turned out, he admired the Col. for his courage and what turned out to be a suicide mission.
The film is excellent in every department - production and art design, locations, directing, acting, costume design, music score, attention to detail, everything looks completely authentic to the period. This film is a real tribute to the memory of a true hero, Col. von Stauffenberg, not only a hero of Deutschland, the German people, and to all Jews everywhere, but to the entire free world, and his stalwart company of dedicated men who gave their lives for the cause of freedom from the tyranny of Hitler's Third Reich.
The movie was filmed entirely on location in Germany, and is available in a special German-language version for the people of Germany. This is an important film in the history of world cinema, and a must-see for anyone interested in history, World War II, or the history of Germany, or anyone who loves a great drama.
I understand the production company had to receive a special permit to use the Nazi swastika symbol on their flags and other props throughout the production of the picture, because the Nazi swastika is totally illegal in modern Germany.
I give this picture five stars! It is a gripping, thrilling, suspenseful drama.",1268697600,2,1958,4.533898305084746

The movie is beautifully filmed and every aspect from costumes to props are accurate for the period right down to the English-made Pencil Bomb that was actually used in the attempt to blow up the aircraft Hitler was flying on.  In a strange twist of fate, Tom Cruise has more than a casual resemblance to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg who is part of the German Wehrmacht and a secret group, and who carries out the assassination attempt on Hitler which helps add additional believability to the film. The casting and editing are all first-rate and there's not a dull or boring moment in the entire movie whether or not you're a Tom Cruise fan.

The two things against the movie is that everyone knows the ending and everyone in the film uses different accents.  I don't mind that German is not spoken by the actors, but I wish they had at least all settled on one accent to use.  For me it was a bit distracting and took me a little out of the movie at parts.

3675974,3,B001KZIRKY,"In Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie,"" Tom Cruise plays the anti-Hitler conspirator Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and in the process Cruise trades his infectious smile for a glass eyeball.  In ""Superman Returns,"" Bryan Singer tries to make human and knowable an invincible man who chooses to fly around the sky in his underwear, and in ""Valkyrie"" Singer must deal with another impossible superhero:  Tom Cruise.

The script is terrible and seems hastily written.  The script comes across as very amateurish when compared with ""The Good Shepherd,"" a very good spy film script that is suspenseful and tightly woven, and deftly incorporates the metapors and symbols of espionage and conspiracy.  By comparison ""Valkyrie"" lacks depth and credibility.  I was ready to stop watching the movie after one ridiculous scene where Cruise and one of his co-conspirators confronts Colonel General Frederich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) to seek his implicit approval for the coup d'etat against the Nazis.  In what should have been an acutely subtle scene where motivations and allegiances are revealed in the inflection of the voice or a glance of the eye the three are much too blatant and direct with each other.

Indeed, the film feels a lot like ""Jerry Maguire,"" and not enough like ""The Good Shepherd.""  At the film's climax Tom Cruise is working the phones, in a scene that could have come right out of ""Jerry Maguire.""  There's too much heroism and bravuda, and not enough ulterior motives and duplicity that make a conspiracy a conspiracy.  The conspirators were all too easy to fall in line behind the noble but rash von Stauffenberg, and in Hitler Germany where everybody swore allegiance to the Fuhrer it's hard to imagine that the conspiracy could have assembled dozens of plotters without there being leaks and double crosses.  Everyone had a role to play and played it to the letter, and there was no room for doubt and compromise and shifting allegiances.  (War brings out the worst and the best in people, as the films ""The Counterfeiters"" and ""King Rat"" competently demonstrate.)  But the worst crime committed here is simple and damning:  this film is very boring for a very good hour before the coup d'etat fully unfolds.

Bryan Singer was very impressive in ""The Usual Suspects,"" but he has not made a decent film since.  ""Superman Returns"" was a pretentious and pointless film that went nowhere, and in ""Valkyrie"" Singer has managed the same feat twice.",1263513600,,2447,5.017326732673268
3675975,4,B001KZIRKY,"While I certainly enjoyed watching the film, some crucial details of the anti-Hitler plot were tweaked and, as a result, shown incorrectly. They were tweaked, probably in order to ennoble the plotters more (and by extension, in my view, if not to re-write history, but to give a more positive twists to the German resistance during WW2).
For example, General Beck (brilliantly, in my view, played by Terence Stamp) is portrayed as personally asking to commit suicide. In reality, he was ordered to shoot himself by General Fromm, but succeeded only in wounding himself, and a sergeant was brought in to administer the coup de grce by shooting Beck in the back of the neck. The film omitted that.
This and other tweaked details reveal more telling and dubious undercurrent - it is desire by some to present the officers corp as (failed) saviors of Germany - it should be rejected out of hands. In reality, the Wehrmaht's generals, while not rabid Nazis en masse, nevertheless had showed themselves unusually subservient to Hitler. Even the Soviet generals during the War slammed and opposed Stalin's orders more, if they deemed the orders impractical or stupid. It is not by accident that Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel (Head of Army High Command, top guy in the Army) had a nickname Lakeitel (a little lackey). I would give the cast five stars, but to the story - three.",1263340800,2,1368,4.85042735042735

Count von Stauffenberg believed that it was his Christian duty to kill Adolph Hitler and came closer to doing so than anyone else ever did (and there were many attempts.)  This film is faithful to History and represents the best telling so far of the plot to kill Hitler.  Tom Cruise does not disappoint as von Stauffenberg, and even looks quite a bit like the real Count von Stauffenberg who was a handsome and charasmatic man. I am glad that they did not try to have Cruise adopt some fake-sounding German accent.  (Remember the horrible New England accent Kevin Costner tried to adopt in 13 Days?  Perhaps Hollywood learned its lesson!) The equipment, uniforms, and sets of this film are carefully and accurately done and really do transport the viewer to Nazi Germany in an almost uncanny fashion.  This is a high budget film and it shows.

The storyline of this film moves along at a deliberate and fast pace, and keeps the viewer's interest throughout.  There are a few slow points, but not many.  The film accurately depicts the difficulties that the plotters faced, particularly Count von Stauffenberg himself, who was missing most of his fingers and who accordingly had physical difficulties even activating the acid fuse of the bomb.  Alas fate intervened and the world had to suffer many more months of Hitler's evil existence.  But not through any lack of courage by Count von Stauffenberg.

3675990,4,B001KZIRKY,"Plays into the stereotype - not to see whitewash - of the ""good"" German Army vs. ""the bad"" Hitler/SS/Nazi Party.  Colonel von Stauffenberg's motives may have been personally the highest, but the attempt to drape the whole German Army in the rightousness of his protest goes too far.  The Wehrmacht's role in war crimes is too well-documented.  The motive for most of the plotters (and the film does allude to this) were to scrape Germany's wartorn nuts out of the fire by assassinating Hitler, make peace with the Western Alles, and prevent the occupation of Germany, repeating the successful diplomacy of WW I.  No doubt the outcome for Germany would have been happier if the plot had succeeded.

Cruise does an excellent job portraying the Colonel, and even bears a striking physical resemblance to the real man. A lot was crammed into two hours of film, which might make it uneven and perhaps confusing for those unfamiliar with the story.  This is compensated by its swift to-the-bone pace, making for a gripping film that is best watched complete from beginning to end.  The reconstruction of period detail is impeccable throughout.

A revealing afternote to the story: Wehrmacht war criminals sentenced at Nuremberg were released from American custody at the insistence of Federal Chancellor Adenauer in 1955, to gain the officer corps' cooperation in forming the new NATO-led Bundeswehr.  This included their amnesty and complete rehabilitation.  Many of these officers returned to active duty, justifying their wartime deeds with highly revisionist accounts of Germany's wartime ""struggle"" and ""sacrifice,"" while draping themselves in the mantle of von Stauffenberg's attempted redemption.  Fortunately for the modern Bundeswehr that he was executed, as he would have doubtless taken aim next at its self-serving mythology.

Ironic, too, that this story of an act of terror is released and receiving highly-deserved acclaim during a self-described ""War on Terror.""  Apparently there is ""good"" terror and ""bad"" terror, like ""good"" soldiers and ""bad.""",1258070400,2,2057,5.311728395061729

3675994,4,B001KZIRKY,"When a two-hour movie spurs you to spend four more hours reading about the event on which it is based, it's fair to say the viewing was time well spent.  I didn't expect much from Valkyrie.  I mean, we all know how this story ends (I realize schooling isn't what it used to be, but do we really need a spoiler alert here?).  So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself, frankly, riveted.  So much is top notch here: the production design, the photography, the pacing, and especially the supporting actors.  Indeed, every actor -- Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, even -- seems an inspired choice for their respective role, creating multi-dimensional characters that are flawed, conflicted, and all too human.  Or at least, every actor but one.  The bad news: Tom Cruise just doesn't pull it off here.  In fact, he nearly ruins the show.  I've liked Cruise in other roles -- he's underrated in Born on the Fourth of July and his bravado-on-autopilot schtick works well in A Few Good Men.  But here he is oddly ineffective.  The screenwriters don't exactly help him -- when we first see Cruise, his view of the war and its political leaders is already set, and we never get a sense of how this came about.  When he is blown up early in the film, losing an eye, one hand, and several fingers on the other, these grievous injuries are treated like a minor inconvenience.  This is a theme that continues through the movie: Emotional events rendered with zero emotion.  Everyone else here struggles with the decision to try to kill Hitler.  They know it should happen, but they're also worried about the consequences of failing (and not insignificantly, what those consequences will mean for their own skin -- maybe not the most noble consideration, but a genuine one).  Cruise's character -- who knows well that if he fails his family will likely be arrested, or worse -- never seems to truly wrestle with his decision to deliver the lethal blow (or, more accurately, blast).  The few cursory flicks at indecision, like that last long embrace of his wife, seem staged and rote and insincere.  His unwavering dedication to the mission might make Cruise's character a hero.  But it also makes him seem fake.  I mean, here's a plan where the guy with three fingers is picked to arm the bomb -- who wouldn't have some second thoughts about an operation like that?  But Cruise treats this all like he's Maverick from Top Gun: Just give me the stick (of TNT, this time) and let me do my job.  It doesn't work.  But fortunately, almost everything else in this film does.",1256601600,2,2567,4.655555555555556

I was honestly a bit skeptical of this film when I purchased it because of the reviews and because of already having so much knowledge of the event through both English and German documentary and historical records.  I have to say that I was very pleased with the historical accuracy; scenes were very well done and presented a good flow of the action from one scene to the next; characters were very well developed so that you found yourself caught up in the film.  Though it is difficult for westerners to be sympathetic to a story of a real high ranking Nazi officer, this film will give those with open minds a chance to see what life would have been like for one loyally serving in such a military to realize that there is only one solution and to be willing to act.

3676000,3,B001KZIRKY,"A nice effort as bringing to the cinema one of the most dramatic episodes of WW2 but unfortunately it is a bit hit and miss.

For most people of my generation in the UK the plot to assassinate Hitler is pretty well known.  For most, it was put together by high ranking German army officers who saw the hopelessness of the German cause in WW2 and hoped with Hitler out of the way they could negotiate a more amicable truce with the allies and therein lies the problem.  The film has no real depth or background.  For a 2 hour film I felt like that Christopher Walker character in the film true romance where he said ""What we have here is a game of show and tell, you show me everything but don't tell me anything""

We have the officers who are planning the assassination but no real background of what has motivated them to do so.  All we have is that they saw the annihilation of Germany and Europe and wanted the war to end.  All well and good but just how did they intend to do that?  What kind of truce did they hope to negotiate?  With whom did they intend to negotiate with?  The Soviets who has suffered the most under German invasion, the Western Allies who were by 1944 equally in little mood of any kind of amicable truce with Germany and what kind of post truce Europe were they hoping to create?  One that Germany still occupies large parts of Europe or one where they returned to pre war borders?  Did they ally themselves with any of the resistance in occupied Europe and if not why not?  Did they have contact with the allies and what kind of help were they given?  What kind of government did they wish to set up?  A democracy, a military dictatorship?  You would think in a 2 hour film we would be given some background to the coup/assassination attempt but I felt like I was back in school with that tired uninterested history teacher just telling me ""And there was an assassination attempt on Hitler which if it succeeded may have ended the war earlier""

Positives are in the film the actual extent of the assassination attempt/coup the fact that this was a very real attempt to overthrow the Hitler regime but as I say, there is very little in the film to give the viewer any insight to it.  I understand that this film gave great concern in Germany where sensitivity in regards to WW2 would possibly be most felt however, my main concerns with this film are what is left out of it rather than its actual contents.  Cruise does a fairly decent job as the main character and though people have argued that an American accent spoils the film I would say its no worse than the generic English accent that usually accompanies war film I mean the film Enemy at the Gates has full English accents throughout the film even though its set in WW2 Stalingrad! To be honest I would rather have Cruise stick to his own accent than try and attempt a German accent.

I give this 3 stars as its fairly fast moving and the whole coup plot is quite interesting however I would say it is seriously lacking in content.",1254528000,,3018,4.364937388193202
3676001,4,B001KZIRKY,"The Bottom Line:

Tom Cruise does stick out a bit from the largely-European cast (though admittedly he looks a lot like his real-life counterpart), but for the most part Valkyrie is a well-made thriller with good production values and performances that manages to generate a fair amount of tension despite the fact that the audience knows Hitler isn't going to die; despite all the controversy and mud-slinging, this is a legitimately good film.

3676002,4,B001KZIRKY,"Since the close of WWII, Germany has had to bear with its image of a nation of just-following-orders Nazis. Schindler's List told the story of some valorous citizens. Now Valkyrie has done the same with the military, relating the details of a nearly successful conspiracy among a cadre of high ranking officers to assassinate Hitler, overthrow his regime, and end the war. This is an extraordinary film, one in which the suspense builds slowly, always heightened by a sense of foreboding, since we know they will fail. The cast is superb (what a treat to see Terence Stamp again), with the power to convey, mostly nonverbally, the awesome courage required to risk everything for the greater good. Shot in Germany, the visuals capture the cold-blooded essence of Naziism, and the firing squad scenes are particularly effective. Only a few problems stand out. The orchestral score is a fine, unobtrusive one, until the conspiracy begins unravelling, at which point the music grows so tragic that it's cloying. Also, some rather silly lines, such as the one comparing the conspirators to Sodom and Gomorrah's righteous men, occasionally jolt. Though imperfect, however, Valkyrie takes a relatively obscure historical event and brings it into the light with the respect it deserves.",1254528000,3,1278,5.178743961352657

The character he plays and the overall theme of the film, is that to stand for what you believe will cost you something.  And some things are worth taking a stand for.

3676006,4,B001KZIRKY,"The problem with a true story is you, of course, know how it will end. There are no spoilers to worry about from people who've seen the movie and no surprises as you watch. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is all in the disposition of the viewer. I for one am not the biggest fan of movies where you know it doesn't end well for the team that you're rooting for. But after it was all said and done, Valkyrie was not only a great movie, but an interesting history lesson.

First of all, as much I, for whatever reason, want to dislike Tom Cruise, there is no denying that when he is in a movie, chances are because of him alone, that the movie will be at least 10 times better....Such is the case with Valkyrie. Tom Cruise makes this movie work. You get so wrapped up in his character that you forget that you're watching an actor that you've probably seen in at least a dozen other movies.

The entire cast does an outstanding job. Director Bryan Singer keeps the action and suspense rolling at a quick pace as if he were back directing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B001PPGAJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>.

It's truly amazing to watch this movie and try to come to grips with the fact that so many in Hitler's own regime and country were against him, but to bring one man down and literally change the course of history was next to impossible. But that this impossibility was actually almost pulled off but failed is just plain depressing.

So will you get a happy ending? Well if you know anything about how Hitler ultimately fell you already know the answer. But will you get a great movie? I'd say that's a yes. Give Valkyrie a try.",1252454400,3,1710,4.652317880794702

3676009,4,B001KZIRKY,"""Valkyrie"" was a surprisingly good dramatization of the real events surrounding the last major attempt to assassinate Adolph Hitler. With any Hollywood movie covering such a sensitive historical event, there is always going to controversy over which facts are emphasized, omitted, or ""embellished"". I found ""Valkyrie"" to be an exciting movie that remained close enough to the historical realities to still be considered worthwhile.

Since the plot is taken directly from history, and everyone knows (or should know) that Hitler died by his own hand less than a year after the events portrayed in this movie, I'm not going to worry about giving away any spoilers. Towards the end of WWII, even some of the most loyal German officers realized that Hitler had lost both the war and likely his mind. In addition, the general Army officers often resented and feared the power and inhuman methods of the SS and Gestapo. ""Valkerie"" follows the core group of officers that devised a plan to assassinate Hitler, neutralize the SS and Gestapo, and sue for peace with the advancing Allies.

This was a very well made movie, setting the right atmosphere with the music, set and costume design, and really good cinematography (the shots of the forests were just amazing). The cast was first rate, with Tom Cruise (I'm not really a fan) skillfully portraying a confident and somewhat arrogant Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. My only major complaint was with the wild fluctuation of sound volume that resulted in us having to stop, turn up the volume, and replay some scenes to hear the dialog, only to be deafened when the next LOUD event started.

Overall, ""Valkyrie"" was an engaging movie that was good exposure for my teenagers to an important event. While there were some bloody combat scenes, there was very little gratuitous violence or profanity.

Points do go to director Bryan Singer, who somehow manages to wring some suspense out of the story, even when we already know the final outcome. That's a pretty good feat in itself!

3676012,4,B001KZIRKY,"Operation Valkyrie was the fifteenth failed attempt by German patriots to assassinate their despotic dictator, Adolph Hitler (David Bamber). Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) was the leading player in this drama, a Nazi soldier grieviously wounded by World War II and one many said was an 'example' of German bravery.

The film's done a credible job of recreating the scenery and the basic facts of the attempt, although my World War II buff husband could hold forth on inaccuracies on various players in the scenario. Uniforms, vehicles, and buildings are all well-crafted with no CGI.

For the most part, the action was strong enough to keep both the spouse and I watching. I cannot say I enjoyed this film, but it was a fascinating look into the history of World War II and it does well to remind people that the German people were often disputing their leadership, too.

But in the end Hitler would shoot himself in the head in his bunker to avoid capture by the Allies at the end of WWII.",1250985600,2,554,4.138888888888889
3676014,4,B001KZIRKY,"The movie is basically a reconstruction of the plots and two major attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler, reaching its peak on 20 July 1944, when Col. Klaus von Stuffenberg places a briefcase with a British made bomb in Hitler's headquartes. The bomb explodes but Hitler gets away by a whisker, with few burns and a punctured eardrum. The subsequent events lead to the failure of the plot, in part due to hesitation by one of the main the co-conspirators (General Olbricht)  and the execution of most of them.
Generally, the unfolding plot is depicted with high historical accuracy, but this by itself has forced the producers to compress numerous historic events to within the span of the movie, to the detriment of those who are ignorant (or partially ignorant) of the actual history, and who may find the movie boring, or (worse) may get lost in it. To those, I would suggest prior reading on the subject.
Tom Cruise portrays Col Klaus von Stauffenberg superbly. He is cool, utterly composed and radiates purpose. His make up is excellent, in particular his hairdo, making him look almost identical to the real hero, Stauffenberg.
The main supporting cast (interestingly almost all of them British actors) is excellent, in particular Tom Wilkinson as General Erich Fromm, Terence Stamp as General Ludwig Beck, Bill Nighy as General Friedrich Olbricht, Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto Remer, and Kevin McNally as Dr. Friedrich Goerdler. Kenneth Branagh is a bit pale in the role of General Hennig von Tresckow, one of the main plotters (his suicide by a hand grenade is depicted with high historical accuracy).

3676015,5,B001KZIRKY,"This movie has had a great impact on me, I had to watch the movie over and it makes me feel very sad for those brave men who really wanted to do something right but were doomed since the inception of their plan due to rats in their surroundings. We all should take lessons from this plot and how it went. One mistake the group made was the order to take over all of the cities, divisions, radio stations, etc without any on the spot executions. How do you expect same people that 3 minutes ago were working for the other side, all of a sudden start working for you? We are talking about a serious operation here, not some furniture shop business. I'm sure if they would have given orders to shoot all SS, Gestapo and other high command men who were down with Hitler, and if they would have put their own people in all the important communication posts etc, things would have been different.

I don't know why people hate Tom Cruise's performance, that was a brilliant role. He played it smooth, you get a feeling that it was Clause von Stauffenberg himself, that's how much he captured me.

The individual who was involved in the plot and who miraculously was not executed was Philipp Freiherr von Boeselager. Me fathoms he was one of the man along with Alfred Delp S.J. (perhaps unknowingly) leaking the info to the right people about the plot and all of its intricacies. Should not be a surprise here, as man was taught by the Jesuits, ""for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived"" - Revelation 18:23. Of course his son H. E. Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager is also a Knight of Malta, nice reward there for bringing all those men who dared to go against the Holy Inquisition to their quick departure from this planet. We also have The Jesuit provincial, Augustin R&ouml;sch introducing before mentioned Alfred Delp S.J. to the conspirators circle. Hence we have Jesuits knowing everything and anything they needed to know about the plot as Alfred Delp S.J. played a patsy role perhaps not knowing it, for which he was executed. All the German patriots were removed thus, as there is no place for REAL PATRIOTS in this world, we all need be exterminated. Another genius plan hatched by the Society of Jesus in their 500+ year history, BRAVO!!!!

There is a German movie called ""Operation Valkyrie"" with German actors, so you might want to check that one out if you want some German taste.",1250812800,,2444,4.575342465753424
3676016,4,B001KZIRKY,"I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise but for political thrillers it's his best movie since ""a few good men"" in 1993. The movie ""Valkyrie"" was better than anticipated. Stories about the German resistance are overdue but there is an institutionalised agenda to limit or stop public awareness about them. The most crucial part of the movie is the bomb plot on 20 July 1944 and the political coup. A German officer whom wasn't portrayed in the movie made a grave error and failed to ensure the operation Valkyrie codes had ""highest priority"" status when recieved by the German army. Consequently, the German army continued to recieve instructions from Adolf Hitlers headquarters and this is where the coup detat came unstuck. In the event the Valkyrie codes had ""highest priority"" status the German army would have ignored any further communications from Adolf Hitlers headquarters.

The coup of 20 July 1944 is proof there were sophisticated and significant efforts to obtain peace by the Germans. It was a peace the allies didn't want. The German resistance got no help at all from the allies who helped the French resistance and the Dutch resistance just next door. The most successful allied spy ring in Europe the ""Lucy Spy Ring"" under Rudolf Rossler in Switzerland continued to recieve intelligence reports from the German Resistance inside the German High Command (OKW) resulting with the demise at Stalingrad in 1942 and operation Citadel (Kursk) in 1943. In 1944 the German jet industry were producing thousands of Jet fighters and jet bombers by Arado, Messerschmitt and Heinkel. By 1943, the allies were intercepting ALL German radio traffic and allied knowledge of the advanced German military technology sharply became a mind set of allied greed to own the German jet fighters; jet bombers; high speed submarines; radio guided missiles and ballistic missiles.

The allies abandoned the German resistance (and peace) to achieve world technological supremacy instead and the German Resistance were ""written out of history."" There was no peace effort by the allies. The allied agenda imposed ultimatums of ""unconditional surrender"" terms that were a pretext to steal German property, scientists and the worlds most advanced military technology by military force through DDAY and the destruction of western Europe where tens of millions of people were killed. The allies broke the German Enigma code in 1942 and shark Enigma in 1943 and were intercepting all German radio traffic. The allied 24 hour bombing of Germany continued, impeding German supply lines, while ground forces slowly advanced into Germany to steal the worlds most advanced military technology and scientists by military force.

Ask yourself this question. Why would the allies need to impose ultimatums of ""unconditional surrender"" AT ALL on the Germans and launch ""operation overlord"" or DDAY which destroyed western Europe and killed many millions of people when there was already a very sophisticated network of conspirators ""the German resistance"" within the German High Command (OKW) trying to overthrow Adolf Hitler, close the concentration camps and obtain peace in 1943. The allied priority to conduct repeated bombing raids with Lancaster bomber squadrons dropping ""tall boy"" bombs on the Tirpitz battleship in Norwegian fjords in 1944(a second Bismark battleship make)INSTEAD of dropping them on Adolf Hitler in the wolf's lair in East Prussia shows the true allied intentions. The selfish and self interested allies turned their backs on the German resistance whom were ""written out of history"" along with the ""Lucy Spy Ring"" to conceal the big LIE. When the allies obtained the German ""unconditional surrender"" in 1945 the allies turned their backs on their Russian ""allies"" resulting in fifty years of ""The Cold War"" with weapons based on German industrial achievements, technology, and scientists taken from the Germans at the end of world war two.

Science, history, and current affairs are loaded with deceptions and untruths. Satan fooled the whole world he doesn't exist. ""The thief comes in the back door to steal, kill, and destroy.""

It was ok decades ago when James Mason played German General Rommel.  No one was worrying much about foreign cinema's impact on our domestic product back then.  It is quite another in the 21st century to have all American and British actors playing Germans in WWII in their own American and British voices.  There is the necessity of making a viewer feel like he or she is there when recreating history in the movies.  I never felt as if I was in WWII Nazi Germany.  The rest of the film was faithful enough to the event.  Specifically, it studies the July 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler as masterminded by Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise).  I found it interesting if a bit plodding at times.  I don't need such linear and literal reenactments of history.  I appreciate more imaginative retellings.

3676027,4,B001KZIRKY,"MAYBE Hitler's assassination in East Prussia, now Poland, would have ended the war and saved many lives but I am sure the abortive assassination did in fact save lives and help end the war. The result of the failed assassination attempt by Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg (a Nazi who saw the evil in Hitler after the insane attack on Russia) did cause enough injuries to the evil dictator and megalomaniac to slow him down and make him even more unstable, insane and paranoid. This made him more of a nuisance than an asset to his Generals planning the defence of Nazi occupied Europe. All these factors hastened the end of the horrible 3rd Reich and the brutal and painful end of the vertically challenged dwarf. I knew someone like that once and I told him to his repulsive face, ""You can never have what you most desire and that is to be tall like me."" Ha!, he did not take it well, which pleased me greatly. I am certain that he too will come to a bad end like that creepo swine Hitler.
Based in fact, this movie is very well acted and Tom Cruise excels in his potrayal of the aristocratic war hero who lost one eye and other body parts in the fighting in Tunisia after being strafed by Allied fighters. He makes a bomb using time pencil detonators developed by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) for sabotage missions against the Nazis in occupied Europe. Ah the irony of life! These silent aluminium detonators have to be crimped with pliers to break the capsule of acid inside, which then slowly eats through the wire. This is the time delay before detonation. When the wire breaks, the bomb detonates. Von Stauffenberg packs the bomb in a leather briefcase stuffed full of 'plastique' and tries his best to do the noble deed... but he is thwarted by destiny. At first, they think their ""Putsch"", which is German for Coup d'etat is successful, but then when they find out that Hitler is still alive, they lose their nerve and things go against them. The 60th anniversary of Stauffenberg's failed assassination attempt against Hitler of July 20, 1944, will be officially commemorated in Germany on Monday, July 20, 2009.

German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung led a wreath-laying ceremony on Monday at a memorial in the Bendlerblock courtyard, the former Nazi war ministry in Berlin, where Stauffenberg aged 36, and three fellow conspirators were executed by firing squad hours after the bomb went off. In the movie, Tom Cruise, in his best role yet, in my humble opinion, shouts before the bullets hit him, ""Ich liebe die Freiheit"" which translates as ""I love Freedom"". In actual fact, the real Colonel shouted, ""Long live holy Germany!"" oder ,,Leben lang heiligen Deutschland!""
Well, at the very least he was a patriot at heart. Operation Valkyrie actually comes from Hitler's favourite composer's work Der Ring des Nibelungen in which the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" features. There are four operas in this Ring-Cycle.
I believe that to this day, Richard Wagner's works of music are banned in Israel.
The Nibelung of the title is the dwarf Alberich. Perhaps Hitler identified with the dwarf seeing as he was a malevolent midget himself, Ha! Ha! The Valkyries are warrior-maidens, daughters of Wotan.
May all dictators whether it be Mao Tse Tung, Mussolini, Napoleon or Kim Jong Il, die horrible, slow, painful deaths, and may they rot in hell forever. Die Gedanken sind frei! {:-)",1249084800,2,3404,4.789115646258503
3676028,5,B001KZIRKY,"I know the reviews were bad on this movie.  My First impressions when I seen the previews besides that he looked lame wearing a eyepatch was that Tom Cruise career is going to Hell. I'm not really a big WW2 guy either. So I'm not a historian or someone obsessed with whether this movie was historically correct. It was However, A GREAT MOVIE.

 Even though we know the outcome the movie does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat. Not many movies can do that for me and this movie did. A very strong cast does an incredible acting job.

I would also to add something for all the people who left bad reviews because people were not speaking english with a ""german"" accent.  For one this is a american version with AMERICAN actors. I would of much rather the director just use thier own voices which he did then make Tom Cruise go around faking some Cheesy German Accent. My Opionion is if you want to here people speak with a German Accent then go get a German movie with subtitles.

Great Movie",1248998400,2,1008,4.306878306878307
3676029,4,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie's premise - the plot to kill Hitler - was practically scripted for a movie.  Preparing for my Delta Green role-playing game campaign meant researching Nazis and Project Valkyrie, a major historical but oft-ignored event by the American public.  Until now.

Because the movie is based on a historical account, typical models of assessing a film - like a twist ending, for example - aren't possible.  We know how things turned out.  In fact, doing research on how Valkyrie came about and ended somewhat tarnished the movie for me.  Valkyrie's not bad, but it wasn't the great drama I hoped it would be.

Tom Cruise is perfectly serviceable as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, and the surrounding cast does an excellent job of showing what amounts to a typical bureaucracy.  The more apparent it becomes that Germany might lose the war, the more urgent the plans to overthrow him.

But there were other factors motivating these desperate men, factors that are somewhat lost in the film.  My understanding - and I admit this is limited, as I'm no WWII scholar - is that the nobility that led warfare in olden times, and specifically World War I, felt that there was a ""wrong"" and ""right"" way to conduct a war.  Hitler didn't so much offend this old guard's sense of moral responsibility as it did their sense of following the rules according to an educated upper class.  In a sense, Hitler's war was a peoples' war, waged at whatever cost and using whatever resources necessary and, at times, ignoring the right of the nobility to determine how a conflict was conducted.

This is important because Stauffenberg, and some of the elites involved in the attempted coup, were members of this aggrieved ruling class.  This isn't to say that Stauffenberg didn't find Hitler's policies reprehensible, but as a large group, it helps explain the framework for why a coup would even be conceived.  This entire thrust seems to be deemphasized in the film.  It's almost as if Singer was concerned that playing up Stauffenberg's nobility might be a comment on Cruise himself.

The other part that seems to be lacking from the film is the miserable ending for the conspirators.  Stulpnagel, the German commander in France, tried to shoot himself several times before being captured by the Gestapo.  There is a brief scene where the surviving conspirators are put on a mock trial and holding their pants up; this is because they weren't given belts, to humiliate them more.  The scene flashes by so fast that, to a viewer who is unaware of those circumstances, it just seems like the defendants lost a lot of weight and are holding up their pants.

And that sums up the problems I had with the movie.  The tension is ratcheted up, there are little known scenes drawn from actual history that further enhance the film, but it all seems to be disconnected from the greater war.  It's like Valkyrie took place in a hermetically sealed film universe. This adds to the claustrophobia of the conspiracy, but doesn't quite satisfy those looking for a historical context.",1248825600,3,3052,4.838150289017341
3676030,1,B001KZIRKY,What could have been a top rate movie was destroyed by one thing and one only. You could hardly hear the words being spoken and you were drowned out by the loudness of the music. Whoever did the sound should consider another profession and Tom Cruise needs to take lessons in voice projection.,1248739200,5,293,4.547169811320755
3676031,4,B001KZIRKY,"Based on the true story of the July 20th 1944 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, this movie tells some of the story of the plot that lead to the bombing of the dictator. Tom Cruise plays Klaus von Stauffenberg, the man tasked with setting the explosive device and who was severely maimed, losing the use of one arm and half his other hand during a battle several years before.

Cruise doesn't do a bad job in the role, to his credit. I was able to see beyond ""this is Tom Cruise"" and connect with his character. An excellent supporting case including Hugh Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Eddie Izzard (yes, Eddie Izzard) really help Cruise and the movie which runs the risk of trying to tell too much and getting bogged down with detail.

In this age of CGI, blood and gore, it was quite nice to watch a character-driven movie that relied on acting more than effects. There are some, I hasten to add for those ""action"" people, but this is more a drama than an action flick. The story is pretty much on-target with the history of the July 20th plot and there is a good balance between telling us what we need to know in order to follow the story without confusing us while doing so.

This film, like so many others of this kind runs into problems with a pet peeve of mine: accents. Tom Cruise is a talented actor. I am sure he is capable of putting on a German, or British accent, but he doesn't. Not a problem, necessarily, except that he is surrounded by a mixture of British and German accents with no obvious differences as to who speaks what. I don't know why directors let this happen. It's not a big deal, I guess, to many viewers, but if everyone's supposed to be from the same place, at least get some form of similarity in accents, rather than allow each actor to decide ""how"" they're going to speak.

Sigh.

Anyway, other than that, everyone in the main cast well lives up to their assigned roles. Special Kudos to Bill Nighy for an excellent, indecisive General Olbricht.

The inner circle of Hitler (Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Speer) are secondary to this story and rightly so. Even Hitler is involved when he absolutely needs to be, keeping the focus of the story on the plot, rather than the target and the job is excellent in this regards. David Bamber is an okay Hitler, for what's it's worth. Harvey Friedman isn't a particularly good Goebbels other than he looks the part. However, none of this really detracts from the film.

So, to conclude...if you know the story, this is still a film worth watching. There are no surprised for those who do know the history. It's nice to see that decent historical-drama type of films are still made and able to attract big names. If you're looking for ""Private Ryan"" action, this isn't for you.

3676032,3,B001KZIRKY,"Normally when you think of think of Tom Cruise you picture a good action movie by the look of Valkyrie, that is not the case here. Valkyrie takes place during World War II and involves the high ranking German officials who opposed Hitler and wished to save Germany form his evil rule. The majority of the movie is rather dull until the climax when the secret organization takes over Berlin claiming Hitler is dead.

Overall, the movie isn't worth buying, but it is worth a rental. The plot is interesting but it is easy to see the outcome of the ending.",1248220800,,553,4.475247524752476

And Cruise was certainly not miscast in this movie, in fact, I thought he was very good.  He blended into the movie unlike, say, Ben Affleck in ""Shakespeare In Love"" who stood out like a sore thumb.

Even though we already know they failed to kill Hitler, somehow, I got caught up in their plan and hoped they'd nail him.  That's how well the movie draws you in.

3676037,5,B001KZIRKY,"Note: The following is my review from January 30, 2009, with an update.

I just came from seeing ""Valkyrie"" and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The actiing, directing & everything else were excellent. This is the first reteaming of Bryan Singer & Christopher McQuarrie since ""The Uusal Suspects,"" for which McQuarrie won Best Screenplay. The film stars Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Christian Berkel, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izard, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hollander, Carice Van Houten & David Bamber. Everyone did a wonderful job. Though anyone who studied history knows the outcome of the plot (Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945), the movie keeps you in suspense. I was literally watching the screen, my hands freezing, as Stauffenberg put Operation Valkyrie in motion. I kept thinking, ""If only..."" At one point, I thought, about another character, ""That son of a..."" I nearly cried at the end of the movie. From the very beginning, we're thrust into Stauffenberg's world and the movie never lets up for a single minute. Stay for a few minutes after the final image fades from the screen for a brief epilogue on Hitler, the fate of Stauffenberg's family and a moving tribute to Stauffenberg, Tresckow, Olbricht, Beck, Von Quirnheim, Fellegeibel, Goerdler, Von Helldorf & the others who dared to stand against Hitler's evil regime, even in the face of certain death. ""I am engaged in high treason with all means available to me..."" These men knew the risks to their own lives & the lives of their families, but they were bold & brave enough to sacrifice themselves for what they believed in. They ""Put their principles above personal gain."" While Hitler's evil regime was on the move, Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) and others were covertly plotting to destroy Hitler. ""Well, we have to show the world that not all of us were like him."" These men stood up for what they believed in, though it cost them their lives, but their sacrifice was not in vain. The movie is rated PG-13 for violence & brief strong language, but it should've been PG (the violence and language were very mild).

The special features on the 2-Disc DVD aren't that extensive, but well worth it. No deleted scenes (a few scenes in the first trailer, several lines in the three trailers and a scene where Stauffenberg dances with his wife were cut from the movie; I have no idea why) or extensive documentaries on the making of the movie, but a 16 minute featurette which includes a segment with Stauffenberg's grandson (who has a minor role in the movie), a 43 minute documentary on the legacy of the July 20th 1944 plot and two excellent commentaries, one with Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer & Christopher McQuarrie and the other with Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander. The first commentary is very informative AND peppered with anecdotes about what went on during the making of the film; the second one is mostly for people who hope to make a career as a screenwriter and is also entertaining. Both commentaries make references to scenes that were cut from the film and they also explain why the scenes were deleted. (It wouldn't hurt to have included the scenes on the DVD as deleted scenes with optional director, star & screenwriter commentary, though). I highly recommend both commentaries, the featurette and the 43 minute documentary. All of the material is enlightening, entertaining, but most of all, educational. And why does the 2-Disc DVD not include the five extra featurettes available on the Blu-Ray? Those are my only complaints about the DVD.",1247875200,5,3532,4.914572864321608

As it was, Cruise's performance was well done, and a rather demure character Stauffenberg was, considering most of Cruise's action-packed past roles.  I don't know how historically accurate the film was, but it succeeded in conveying that many who were in ranks with Hitler did not support his tactics.  Consequently, it also candidly revealed the punishment for rebelling.

Although I am not normally too impressed with Tom Cruise, he gives a stellar performance in his depiction of Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, who was one of the ringleaders of the attempted coup.

As those who are familiar with WWII history know, this was the last of several attempted assassination attempts against the German dictator.  It was spearheaded by von Stauffenberg and other German officers who wanted to find a way for Germany to survive the Hitler insanity and be able to negotiate a reasonable peace with the Allies.  Although many films purporting to be historical are not, this one is actually very true to the events in question.

3676045,4,B001KZIRKY,"As a straightforward telling of the true life story of the last known assassination attempt on Hitler, in 1944, what this movie lacks in surprises it makes up with more than a dash of style.
A stellar cast come together, in a movie with a very traditional feel about it - non showy direction, just telling the story as it was.  Tom Cruise is fine as Stauffenberg, with just enough depth to portray the level of charisma the man must surely have had to get as far as he did, and the boldness he must have had to start the whole process with as much confidence as he seems to have had.  The rest of the cast is like a who's who of British cinema, reminding the viewer of the classic war movies of old.  And the movie really does seem to share a gene pool with those epic war movies recreating real life movies, with the same pros and cons they had.  On the plus side, the movie convinces on authenticity.  Events appear close to the known facts, without too much embroidering for effect.  The budget, though not overblown by today's standards, and fairly small by Cruise' standards, has enough to create some terrific set design - the planes, the settings, the real life locations, and the recreation of the wolf's lair - all help to immerse you in the story.  On the minus side, the cast are all worthy, but never outstanding.  It's as if they are playing their roles with kid gloves, to be as reverential as possible to people who actually existed.  Perhaps with one exception - Bill Nighy portrays the films more ambiguous character, in a role which starts to flesh out some of the anguish that must have been felt building up to what amounted to High Treason.  It's a performance which manages to scratch a little beneath the surface of how it would have felt, rather than the bare facts - and yet still treats the character with respect.
Kudos to director Bryan Singer then - he has taken a moribund genre (WW II thriller), with a story we know the ending to, and still managed to make something relatively nail biting, and certainly visually satisfying.  It's just not got enough depth or originality to join the ranks of the classics.",1247011200,2,2139,4.487113402061856

3676049,4,B001KZIRKY,"An excellent movie, Valkyrie avoids discussion of the previous officer plots to assassinate or depose Hitler, some of which go back to 1938. An underground resistance, made up of former government officials and serving military officers, eventually formed to oppose Hitler. The reasons for resistance varied: some disagreed with the Nazi's racial policies, others felt that Catholicism was under attack, yet others simply wanted Hitler gone because they felt he was incompetent in prosecuting the war. Valkyrie doesn't really go into this and it's too bad because it would have added a human element to the story.

As far as the mechanics of the plot itself the movie is excellent and seems to accurately portray the various elements involved. I liked the discussion of the plan and the clips which showed how the plot was SUPPOSED to work and then as the movie progressed how the plot ACTUALLY  progressed. The movie followed the historical facts closely, including the first, aborted attempt on Hitler's life made by Stauffenberg.

The acting in this film was excellent. Tom Cruise got it exactly right I think. The supporting cast filled their roles well and even the music was dead-on.

This extraordinary story reflects the bravery of the people within Germany who did resist the Nazis. To be fair, it probably underplayed the risk as I am sure the reprisals against the families of the plotters were brutal.

Cruise is perfectly capable in this film, the man can act and it's a shame that his off screen antics overshadow his performances. It seems that the industry is willing him to make a stinker so they can perform some sort of Coup de Grace on him and finish him off.

He is backed by a fine cast of largely British character actors and quite right, they have laid off the ""ver are zey going"" cod German accents. We always laugh at Sean Connery and his ability to make every nationality Scottish but generally well known actors doing crappy accents (Streepy in ""Out of Africa"" anyone?) is off-putting in the extreme, Cruise appears to have learned from the ""Far and Away"" debacle, and just delivers his lines straight. It transitions nicely from German in the first few minutes, just to show that actually, the Germans in WW"" actually spoke German, just in case anyone was in doubt, still, it was nicely done. Possibly only Leo DiCaprio should be the only actor allowed to do foreign accents, he was excellent in Blood Diamond.

Anyway, the film was tense, well acted and looked great, I have no idea what the moans of the critics were, what did they want, Tom Hanks to play Hitler? Oh, and they managed to avoid the main Hollywood pitfalls of

a) Adding the happy ending - ""actually, Hitler did die!""
b) Adding in some Americans - ""the plot was run by some American agents who were dressed as Germans etc etc"".

I need not comment on the acting; all main parts were played by exceptionally gifted actors. I also appreciated the film's linear unfolding, free from the endless flashbacks and other gimmicks that mar many modern movies. The only negative aspect about this film--no fault of the producers--is that it narrates a very sad story, so when the lights come on you are left with a bitter taste of dissatisfaction as you ponder how much grief and destruction would have been spared, if the assassination attempt had succeeded.

I get that there were some that wanted Hitler dead, but many didn't, and it was hanging in the air, unresolved, through the whole movie.  I could feel the allies closing in and the underlying tension that it was time to chose sides, but missing was the regime itself.  Only at the end when caricatures of the judges were used that I felt the director actually read some history.

3676072,5,B001KZIRKY,"Tom Cruise gives a great performance as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. As I noted in Collateral, Cruise has the ability to drive a film, and he does it here.

Even though we all know the actual outcome, I somehow found myself hoping that Stauffenberg would succeed and a new government come to power in Germany. Flawless direction, an excellent supporting cast, authentic-appearing sets, uniforms, vehicles, and airplanes created an incredible illusion of reality. Plenty of suspense.

The film built a compelling atmosphere of the fear endured by those engaged in a conspiracy surrounded by hostile forces in a police state. These brave men and women had their necks on the line.

This movie inspired me to delve a little deeper into the story. According to Wikipedia, 4,980 people were executed in the aftermath of the failed assassination, many of them high officials in the German military/government. These executions gutted the German resistance movement against Hitler. It seems certain that if Hitler had died at the ""Wolf's Lair,"" Operation Valkyrie would have succeeded. That is, a Nazi-less government would have come to power. This government would have negotiated a quick end to the war, thus stopping all the atrocities committed by the Hitler regime between July of 1944 and the end of the war in Europe in May of 1945. And, of course, saving all of those who died in the heavy fighting during this period.

The film has historical value in that it illustrates the widespread opposition to Hitler's regime among the German people.",1245456000,2,1617,5.090566037735849
3676073,3,B001KZIRKY,"Over the course of Hitler's devastating reign of terror as the leader of Nazi Germany he commanded what appeared to be unwavering loyalty from all under his command. However, during his tyrannical tenure there were a total of seventeen assassination attempts made on Hitler's life. This fact proved that not everyone within his grasp was onboard with the Fuhrer's genocidal plans, and that some were even willing to risk their very lives to put an end to his evil. Out of the seventeen attempts, the final attempt codenamed Operation Walkre, remains one of the most infamous. This is true, not only for how the operation was carried out, but also for just how far reaching the disillusionment with the Nazi party and the atrocities they committed had become amongst some of the military and civilians within the country.

""Valkyrie"" is based on the true story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), who led a group of high-ranking officials within Nazi Germany in an incredible assassination attempt on the life of Adolf Hitler. For them to succeed would mean Germany could begin to remove the stain of Hitler's reign, but to fail would mean that all involved would become traitors to their country and death would inevitably follow.

For ""Valkyrie"" to actually succeed in creating the undeniably palpable sense of tension surrounding the events on screen is truly surprising to me. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") has crafted a fast-paced, albeit streamlined account, of the events leading up to and following the failed assassination attempt on Hitler during World War II. To achieve this, the screenplay focused upon the bigger moments within the assassination plot to give audiences a general understanding of what will happen should they win the day, while also repeatedly mentioning the possible repercussions that would occur should the coup d'tat fail. Those two story elements, along with Singer's quick-cuts in the film's editing process, allowed the story to become much more exhilarating and suspenseful than what should have been possible.

The screenplay's tightly paced, streamlined narrative definitely allowed the movie to become much more of a thriller rather than an historical drama, which was precisely how director Bryan Singer (""Superman Returns"") had envisioned the film. However, in taking this route the film ultimately suffers from being too simplistic and truncated. The plot of Operation Walkre was an intricately conceived plan that was not implemented on a whim, and it required finesse, precision, dedication, and not to mention a good amount of luck. While the film does touch on the fact that the conspirators did not take their decision lightly, it did appear that the operation was not all that hard to devise or execute. Now, I understand that certain elements of the plot and events surrounding it had to be omitted or condensed in order for the film to fit into a two hour running time; yet, in doing so, this approach made the coup seem far too easy to accomplish.

Another problem was that in some ways the story unfolded in an uneven manner. On the one hand the conspirators obviously feared the potential severity of the consequences should they fail, but at the same time the abridged approach to conveying the plot and its drawbacks made the consequences unrealistically appear as less threatening and not nearly as much of a hindrance to signing up for the cause as one might have thought. Even though Bryan Singer wanted to create a thriller surrounding this moment in history, I personally feel that he would have had far greater success with the end result had he opted for a more detailed account as one would find in a typical historical drama. In doing this, the movie could have taken much more time in laying out the various details of the operation, and also shedding even more light on the conspirators involved; therefore providing audiences with a much more fulfilling experience.

Leading the cast in this average and uneven historical thriller is the one-time Hollywood powerhouse, Tom Cruise (""Collateral""). Over the years, I have seen many of Tom Cruise's films, and enjoyed a good majority of them along the way. However, within those plethora of films lies a myriad of performances, ranging from superb (""Collateral"") to good (""Mission: Impossible 2"") to simply phoning it in (as was the case with this film). What went wrong with Tom Cruise's performance in this movie was his extremely flat, unenthused delivery, a general lack of charisma or captivating presence (the real Stauffenberg was known as a very charismatic man), and an obviously lacking German-esque accent.

In regards to the issue of the accent or lack thereof, I understand that many of the other members of the cast didn't adopt German accents for their roles either. However, I know from some of their previous performances, and just their overall talents as actors, that most of them could have adopted a passable accent, if given the opportunity. Yet for this film, director Bryan Singer apparently informed the non-German actors that they were not required to convey an accent because he wasn't concerned with making an historical drama/documentary, but merely an entertaining thriller. To me this sounds more like an excuse used to cover Cruise's shortcomings as an actor than anything else, and an obvious ploy on Singer's part to try to protect his lead actor from becoming embarrassment.

In my opinion, while Cruise did an adequate job in some scenes, his lack of commitment and/or skill in other scenes opposite the much more capable members of the cast made it abundantly clear that Cruise was way out of his league in this film. Thus, leading me, and many other viewers, to believe that any of the other cast members could have done a much more authentic and accurate job of portraying this historical figure, and that the movie would have benefited from this type of change in the end.

Alongside Tom Cruise was an extremely talented assemblage of actors whose performances while good, never veered towards the great or even exceptional side of the spectrum. This was no doubt a by-product of their performances being much more reserved so as to not outshine their lead actor too much in his attempted ""comeback"" movie. Among this group of men featuring the likes of Tom Wilkinson (""Batman Begins""), Bill Nighy (""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"") and Terrence Stamp (""Yes Man""), I found myself disappointed by how average all of their performances tended to be. Again, none of the supporting performances were bad; I just expected more from actors of their caliber. So the movie just felt extremely wanting in this area.

Two other members of the supporting cast worth noting, although their lack of screen time makes them seem more like cameos, Kenneth Branagh (""Wild Wild West"") and comedian Eddie Izzard (TV's ""The Riches"") seemed to show the most promising performances. Yet their lack of time on camera made their historical figures' inclusion into the story seem like afterthoughts. It felt as if the writer thought that their characters, based on the few scenes they appeared in the movie, were somewhat important to the plot (to what extent I don't know); however, in the end it didn't seem like they were worth mentioning all that much to him. This is surprising since Eddie Izzard's character's position at the Wolf's Lair seemed very important to the conspirators' cause. I guess these two actors' lacking story arcs were just another example of how the trimmed down storyline caused the movie to fall way short of its potential.

""Valkyrie"" could have been, and arguably should have been, another great World War II era movie that focused on an important event in history, that if successful could have changed everything from that moment on. Yet questionable decisions on the part of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, regarding making this a faster-paced thriller rather than an historical drama, resulted in a merely average film that will never be as memorable as some of the other entries surrounding this war. Not to mention a weak performance from Tom Cruise, and universally average portrayals from the remainder of the cast, in the end ""Valkyrie"" will go down as being unmemorable for a movie of its genre.

""Valkyrie"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1245456000,2,8382,5.044765342960289

3676075,3,B001KZIRKY,"Apparently this movie is fairly historically accurate, at least as far as the general details of the plot go. The one thing about the movie that probably isn't terribly accurate is the use of English-speaking actors as the main characters. It sort of takes away from the feel of the movie. Some of the scenes of the movie were filmed on-location at actual spots from the real-life action. I enjoyed this movie because it's a famous episode from World War II that most people have heard of but maybe don't know the details of. However, I thought the movie lacked a little punch. A lot of charaters come into the story without a lot of introduction or buildup. At times it makes the story a little confusing or lacking in emotional power. This is one of those movies that sort of does its job with clinical efficiency but lacks in memorable moments or emotion. I didn't find myself caring much about any of the characters or having an emotional reaction to much that happened. I would say that if you are interested in the history of this period, check this movie out for historical interest.

3676076,5,B001KZIRKY,"I love everything about VALKYRIE (even with Tom Cruise in it):  The compelling (true) story; the terrific cast; the writing, pacing, plot, suspense; the staggering authenticity, from the various uniforms to vintage planes to German teletype machines.  This is a movie that is pure quality, made by filmmakers and actors who pay fitting tribute to a small group of German patriots who almost pulled off the impossible in July, 1944.

I knew about this assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler at the Wolf's Lair in the summer of 1944; what I didn't know is how elaborate it was, how many were involved, and how they almost pulled off a coup mobilizing the German Reserve Army under a directive signed by the Fuhrer himself (Operation Valkyrie).  I also didn't know the conspirators were almost exclusively of the aristocratic class, from General Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise).  All were men (and women) horrified at what the Nazis had done to their beloved Germany, along with all the atrocities and brutality; they wanted to take control and negotiate with the Allies for peace--before all of Germany lie in ruins.  But before they could negotiate, they had to take control of the government, and taking control of the government meant killing Hitler.

What a story.  And as the events of Operation Valkyrie transpire--even though we all know how it plays out--the viewer is taken on a magnificent thrill-seeking ride, culminating in an emotional, powerful ending.  And the cast--top notch.  No, I'm no fan of Tom Cruise, but here he turns in a commanding, extraordinary performance as Colonel von Stauffenberg, the leader of Operation Valkyrie.  Cruise is surrounded by quite an impressive ensemble, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Carice von Houten.  Look for a quick cameo by Bernard Hill.  David Bamber plays a very believable Hitler right down to the Fuhrer's creepy mannerisms, while Jamie Parker is very good in his small role as Stauffenberg's loyal-to-the-last-second aide.

Special features.  This special edition contains a commentary by Cruise, director Bryan Singer, and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie.  The commentary contains a plethora of information--not only about making the movie and what the actors were experiencing, but bountiful historical snippets and information about the characters themselves.  It's extremely informative and entertaining (and Cruise has a fantastic sense of humor).  This DVD also contains the documentary ""The Valkyrie Legacy"", which aired on The History Channel.  It, too, is very compelling and informative.  As a special edition this DVD for VALKYRIE is just about as good as it gets.  A must-have for all historical and film buffs.

I don't read movie reviews as a rule, nor do I know much about actors...
All I can say is this is one of the most well-acted, incredibly well told
historical films I have ever seen. I am so glad the sacrifices and struggles endured by the real conspirators have been honored by such a well-crafted, beautifully scored film.

3676079,4,B001KZIRKY,"VALKYRIE is one of those rare period films that knows how much reality to leave in while bending facts just enough to make a compelling film. Complete with an fantastic ensemble cast led by Cruise--who despite being a bit of a loon does in fact know how to act--the film is compelling, well made, and thoroughly enjoyable. It's only real downside is the obvious problem that we already know the ending, and no matter how much we want the plot against Hitler to succeed, we know that it can't and won't. Director Bryan Singer does a great job of keeping things suspenseful under the circumstances, but it is really the stellar cast that drive the movie forward.

The sets and art direction are fantastic, and as a fan of WWII history and especially warplanes, it was a pleasure to see the HE 111s, and even more so the fully restored P-40s used in the opening scene. About as historically accurate as I expected, the film is able to convey a more nuanced view of German officers than the stereotypes typically presented in American propaganda pieces that portray all of them as baby-murdering psychopaths. There were plenty  of those among the Nazis, don't get me wrong, but it's interesting to have probably the most hated regime of the modern era presented in the light of their poorly known resistance movement and its divergent heroes. In light of their impossible situation, it brings interesting questions to the surface: faced with a similar situation, how many of us would have the bravery to stare evil in the face and forfeit our own lives for our beliefs?

As a film, VALKYRIE succeeds. As a history lesson, it's just as good. It's a great movie to watch with your kids (as long as they're old enough to handle the violent moments of the film) to start a discussion of the moral complexities of war; of how good men and women can get stuck on the wrong side, and of how blind love of your country can lead you down some pretty scary paths.

3676080,4,B001KZIRKY,"Given all the advance negative press for this movie, its postponed release date and the flap over potentially doctored photos of Stauffenberg allegedly to make him look 'more like' Tom Cruise than the already-existing resemblance, I had reason to fear that a sad but noble real-life historical event was being manipulated into a self-promotional stunt by an actor bent on career rehabilitation, an actor best known for the likes of ""Top Gun"" and ""Mission:Impossible I, II and III. I feared that the resultant film was going to be epically bad.  Having Bryan ('X-Men','Superman Returns') Singer at the helm did not predispose me to think that ""Valkyrie"" was going to get respectful, sober, 'adult' treatment, either, even with some British heavy guns in the supporting cast.

Having seen the film, once in the theatre and once more on DVD, I have to issue both Mr. Cruise and Mr. Singer apologies, and kudos for defying my expectations so thoroughly.  The last scenes of this film brought me to tears both times, and I do not cry at schlock.  Bravo.  Though I wish with all my heart that the outcome of this brave attempt to stand up to tyranny could have been a positive one, this film treatment is a worthy addition to the von Stauffenberg canon, giving testament to the fact that many brave Germans were willing to defy Hitler to the end, even though it meant making the ultimate sacrifice.

Cruise inhabits the skin of Stauffenberg like he was born to it.  Not only does he master the haircut, uniform and demeanor of a high-ranking German military officer, he also must master navigating a tricky plot while embodying Stauffenberg's war injuries.  The Colonel lost a hand, half the other and an eye in Tunisia, where we first see him writing an anti-Hitler screed in his diary that in itself would have been a capital offense.  Cruise opens with a very creditable German voiceover, but wisely shifts to his own voice for the rest of the film.  As do the other actors.  Mr. Cruise is the only American, but this fact fades into the background soon enough, and he displays more than enough gravitas to be a respected leader of men.  The ubiquitous Tom Wilkinson is comfortable in either British or American, and here he opts, interestingly, for an American accent as Stauffenberg's nemesis in the officer corps.  All the supporting actors are fine, but I want to give special mention to the young actor playing Stauffenberg's lieutentant, who emobodies ultimate loyalty to his commanding officer, and to Carice van Houten, for a brief but powerfully touching role as Stauffenberg's wife and mother of his five children.  She died in 2006, which was too soon to have seen this film, but I can't help thinking she would be pleased.  In the hands of Cruise and Singer, her husband is unquestioningly, a hero of the people.  Highly recommended, even for folks like me who don't like Tom Cruise.  Maybe especially for them.",1245024000,4,2920,4.819639278557114
3676081,3,B001KZIRKY,"For me nothing facinates me more than world history. Being able to see some of the greatest moments in time in a movie setting is nothing but remarkable. Still, there are so many chapters of history that were overshadowed by the 'main event' that they are lost. Film has really given these lost stories a chance to resurface and be shown to the movie going public. Valkyrie is one of those stories.

World War II is one of the most talked about periods of history, but this film shows the story within. During the reign of Hitler in Nazi Germany no one would ever have guessed there were actually high Nazi officials with a heart who knew that what was happening was evil. Led by a decorated soldier who escaped death, these officers fearing their own demise carefully craft a plan to take out the furer and stop what they already knew would be a losing battle.

I felt that the movie was good for what it was. Bryan Singer tried to tell a story of consipiracy and good will with a good cast backing it up. I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise, but I was pretty impressed by the origionallity of his performance. The story moves pretty slow in the begining, but normally stories such as these will.

3676083,4,B001KZIRKY,"Totaly undeserving of the bad rap it received before it even opened, this is a very well researched and perfectly aceptable thriller which reminds me of Apollo 13 in the sense that you know well ahead in advance what the outcome is going to be but very little of the tension is lost nonetheless. Perhaps it would have been better for the film itself if a lesser celebrity than Tom Cruise had played Von Stauffenberg as it becomes somewhat bizarre to see him alongside Hitler in the same screen though it's hard to blame him for going for such an interesting character specially one he does indeed, physicaly resemble (somewhat anyway).
VALKYRIE is not a movie that really aspires to greatness but it is definetely a worthy look at a most interesting chapter of history. That said, the film has one truly stupid scene: Goebbels putting the cyanide pill in his mouth while he waits to see if he is to be arrested when he actually had Hitler on the phone line which should have told him the odds were on his side, too much to go through the danger of putting it there in the first place when he would have had plenty of time to do it later on if necessary.",1244937600,2,1153,4.417840375586854

Let's be real, there was very little noble in the plot.  They just didn't want Hitler to drag them all in Hell with him.  Many thousands of regular German Army soldiers (the Wehrmacht) were convicted after the war of war crimes.  Most Germans regarded the conspirators as traitors.  Knew a guy who dad actually fought in the Wehrmacht and this (former) friend of said, ""Hitler went a little too far.""

It is an excellent, intelligent thriller, and even though the audience knows the outcome in advance, the film never once loses its suspenseful drive.

By shining a light on the inner workings of the Nazi regime, ""Valkyrie"" shows that not all Germans were united with Hitler, and that some gave their lives to restore the Germany they remembered from before the dark days of National Socialism.",1244764800,3,551,5.122222222222222
3676087,3,B001KZIRKY,"This movie is not bad but it's certainly not as great as all the hypes around it. I think most of my review of this movie is about Bryan Singer (the director) We all (well, most of us) know how Hitler died. So this movie is all about how the director present them. The emotion, the passion, the thrill, the tensions and the logic.... but it's kinda lacking in some aspects I mentioned above. Example, the logical aspect, why did Bryan has to show us how Hitler and his important people got blown off by the bomb Stauffenberg put, why didn't he just leave it to how Stauffenberg percepted it? that really bothers me since we know this misson is gonna fail. Is it just a reason to make a pretty cool special effect? or make it more ""action""?
And I like Tom Cruise acting overall even in the Lions for Lambs which they said it's kinda fail. But in this one, I think Bryan put way too much close up to Tom's face (to show expression, I guess) but it just didn't deliver it to me, at least. And it's just way too much, seriously.

I feel depressed watching this movie until when the end message reminded me that this movie is intended to be a tribute to heroic and brave people who are willing to sacrifice themselves for justice and freedom , etc. That start touch my heart, but how about the other 14 known attempts to put out Hitler (as Bryan himself said it at the end message..?) Bryan...Bryan... I like his works at X Men series and even Superman Returns, though. But not on this one, even the acting are pretty solid... but just the way Bryan present this story (which we pretty much know the ending already, most of us do).... doesn't have quite a bite in it. Overall a pretty good movie, especially about history. It's worth watching once, by the way Defiance is a way better true story based movie at almost the same era (Holocaust), it has all the materials needed, thrill, emotion, passion, action , love story and even a little bit comedy.",1244764800,2,1947,4.378453038674033

There have been several flicks done on the July '44 plot against Hitler and practically nothing about the other plots on der Fuhrer, so I went into it a bit jaded.  Having said that, I was overall impressed, but since I'm a history fanatic and heavily into WWII history, I did have some problems with accuracy and particulary the uniforms in the movie.  All of which made me wonder, with such a high budget film, why didn't they get the simple details right?  Also on a personal note, I thought Thomas Kretschmann would have been a much better choice to play Von Stauffenberg, but Kretschmann does his usual great performance in the role he's given.  Also, I kept waiting for the moment when they would introduce Erwin Rommel into the film for his part in the assasination plot, but for some reason, they completely leave Rommel out of the movie.

Overall, an excellent movie and well worth the money, it just bugs me when they make a movie like this and blow details that are easily researched.",1244505600,3,1090,4.564102564102564

Valkyrie is a very good movie, and is undeserving of much of the negativity it has received. It is a well paced film filled with some excellent actors. The story is well told and stays true to the historical events. The video quality of the Bluray is excellent.

3676090,4,B001KZIRKY,"""Look them in the eye, they'll remember you.""

Much has been made of the controversial Tom Cruise's role in this film, and I too was somewhat skeptical of what he, along with ""Hollywood,"" would do with this heroic tale. As it turns out, the film was much better than I expected. Cruise is a strange dude, no doubt, but the man is not a bad actor and I found him perfectly sufficient in portraying the personage of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It should be noted as well that Cruise bears a striking resemblance to the real Stauffenberg.

It seems needless to say, but 'Valkyrie' is the story of the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Stauffenberg, an aristocratic Christian type, was just one of a large conspiracy of army officers to take down the Fuhrer. Stauffenberg is the central character because of his willingness to do the deed personally. Their reasons for doing so were no doubt varied and complex, but to write them off as mere self-serving traitors (as some have done) would be preposterous. Watching the film, one is struck by the physical and moral courage these men displayed, knowing all along what their potential fate would be. Say what you will, these men were downright heroic. Which is also why one can't help but share in the heartbreak as their briefly promising plan disintegrates before their eyes. These men are tragic heroes.

The film is relatively simple, nothing flashy, just a compelling drama. The acting is generally good, my only blatant complaint is the guy who played Hitler. Too much of a skulking caricature, but this was very minor. As a student of history, I was already familiar with the story but sadly, I think it's safe to say that many Americans are quite ignorant of the fact that there were indeed many ""good Germans"" such as these men. Therefore, I applaud this effort to bring the story to mainstream audiences, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed the film. Four stars for this Profile in Courage.",1244419200,2,1959,4.722222222222222

3676092,4,B001KZIRKY,"With all the bad word of mouth associated with ""Valkyrie"" as a backlash against Tom Cruise, I thought this film which focuses on the attempts against Hitler's life by members of the German military and politicians/intellectuals would be bad. Instead, I was surprised to find a solid thriller that manages to be suspenseful for most of its running time even though we know the outcome of the attempts on Hitler.

Although I still find Cruise personally annoying, he gives a very good performance in ""Valkyrie"". Cruise plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg who after being wounded in Africa returns to Germany and is recruited by a team of military leaders (Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson) to try and kill the Fuhrer. A sharp man Stauffenberg recognizes the short comings of their plan to assassinate Hitler and in a bit of irony adapts one of Hitler's own plans to stabilize the German government should anything happen to him--Operation Valkyrie to help the conspirators take control of the German government and seek peace with the Allies. Stauffenberg recognizes that assassinating the Fuhrer may be a one-way trip so he plans an exit strategy of his own to help increase the odds he will come back alive and to his family after the Fuhrer is dead.

""Valkyrie"" looks extremely good in its Blu-ray (and no doubt DVD)debut. The film has a grainy quality which was intentional.

The special features include a terrific documentary made by Ken Burns that aired on Public Television as a tie-in to the movie about the real events that we see dramatized in the movie. It gives us a sense of how Hitler dominated Germany and the endless stream of propaganda the Nazi's used to help ""sell"" the German people on the evil of Jews and anybody that wasn't a true ""German"". It also focuses on the aftermath of the failure of Valkyrie.

We also get a number of featurettes on the production of the film as well as two commentary tracks one featuring director Bryan Singer, Cruise and writer Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie and his co-writer Nathan Alexander appear on a second commentary track. Both are quite informative and entertaining focusing on different elements from pre-production, shooting and post-production of the film.

""Valkyrie"" is a surprisingly good suspense thriller and well worth watching.

3676095,4,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie is a movie based on the true story of the 1944 plot by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Starring Tom Cruise, the film contains all of the necessary elements for successful cinema: good acting, a worthy plot and suspenseful drama. Despite knowing of the ultimate failure of the assassination plot, the movie still is able to hold the audience in rapt attention.

The movie begins when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is injured while fighting Allied forces in northern Africa. Losing an arm and an eye in the attack, Stauffenberg is sent back to Berlin as an officer in the German army reserves. There he becomes involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government so that peace can be brokered with the Allies. After several failed attempts, Stauffenberg succeeds to detonate a bomb in a situation room where Hitler is briefing his top generals. Believing Hitler to be dead, Stauffenberg races back to Berlin while his co-conspirators seizes control of the German reserve army and order them to arrest all SS troops, falsely accusing them of killing Hitler. The coup begins to succeed but falls apart when Hitler makes a national broadcast to prove he was still alive.

Spoiler Alert!!!

The SS troops are released from prison and surround the conspirators' headquarters where Stauffenberg and his accomplices are summarily executed.

End Spoiler Alert!!!

Cruise does an excellent job of portraying Colonel Stauffenberg and turns in one of the better performances of his career. The movie is actually remarkably historically accurate, as far as it goes, and truthfully relates the events almost exactly as they transpired. One can't help but wonder how different history could have turned out if the bomb Stauffenberg detonated had succeeded in killing Hitler or if the Valkyrie coup had succeeded in overthrowing the Nazi government. There are several moments in the movie where you realize if people involved in the Valkyrie plot had faithfully carried out their part in the coup, things might have turned out quite differently.

I consider the film's criticism for not showcasing German accents to be minor and unrelated to the quality of the film.

I appreciate the movie's attempt to convey the courage and moral fortitude these German soldiers displayed to actually move forward with a plot to assassinate their country's leader. They recognized that in order to be a ""good German"" they had to stop the ""bad Germans."" Though it was unquestionably the right thing to do and a valiant attempt to save lives, the officers involved still had to make several tough decisions along the way, knowing that if they failed in their attempts they faced certain torture and death.

Many have pointed out, correctly, that Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators at first supported Hitler when he first rose to power.  This is true, yet they still deserve credit for realizing their errors and attempting to atone for their mistakes, even if it was belated.

The movie only briefly alludes to Stauffenberg's devout Catholicism which undoubtedly paid a pivotal role in his decision to oppose Hitler. Though the movie does not mention it, Stauffenberg was also a member of German nobility. This is interesting only because those who were most prone to opposing Hitler were either the Christians, German aristocracy or the capitalists. Thus Stauffenberg met two of these characteristics. Though it is shamefully nearly forgotten today, the Nazis were a radical left-wing socialist movement and publicized themselves as a worker party.",1243814400,6,3582,5.160344827586207

However, this is by far his best role to date, and it suits him.  Cruise is most comfortable playing a strong, decisive character.  He doesn't do the wishy-washy thing...at all. And in this role, he was a team player.  A key player, but he played the role with stone cold accuracy.  Disciplined.  It works for him.  These are the characters he should play.

None of those yappety, yappety characters.  He likes the military thing.  Suits him well.  I only saw a clip of Magnolia, but I hated the role he played as some cult guru...no matter how true to reality that is. It made him seem squeamish and greasy.  These solid, hard roles suit him.

Well done, Mr. Cruise.",1243814400,4,927,4.493975903614458
3676097,5,B001KZIRKY,"When I saw the preview/trailer for this movie I was very eager for the film to be released.  Sadly, I didn't have the chance to view the movie until it was released on home video.  Nevertheless, upon finishing ""Valkyrie"" I must say I was very, very impressed.  This historical thriller directed astutely by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Usual Suspects) was not only a good movie, but tackled a subject that (from my understanding) hasn't been touched by another filmmaker.  I also want to take this moment to say that the cinematography in this movie was marvelous, both great camera angles and photography of landscapes.

As for the acting it was astonishing. I must say that in the past decade Tom Cruise has come along way in his art of performing.  I would place his role as Colonel Von Stauffenberg as one of, if not the best, performance Tom Cruise has ever done.  Sadly the critics are more focused on Tom Cruise's personal life, religious affiliation, his Jennifer Beal impersonation on Oprah's show a few years ago rather his acting.  The supporting cast was also very solid and very good, featuring Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp (among many fine foreign actors and actress as well.)

I am very familiar with World War II, but am not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I believe this movie did a wonderful job portraying a moment in world history.  The one thing I noticed about me going into this movie is that I already knew how it was going to end, via history.

3676098,4,B001KZIRKY,"In riposte to the terse polemic of J. Ventura's review, . . . ignoring the mysterious neologism 'repping':

--There are MANY TOP GERMAN ACTORS playing MAJOR roles in this film.  The portrayal of the criminal indifference to their imposed sufferings on the German public of Hitler and his inner circle is the single most menacing achievement in this genre to date.  Hitler is not just the worn out neurasthenic hysteric playing the part of the victim what an entire country suffered, as he is in Downfall; where he is seen from the perspective of those who knew him personally, versus as a mere figure of power.  In Valkyrie, the 'dark side' of this is emphasized --the nature of the Junker-Prussian Officer aristocratic caste's palpable fear and barely covert outrage of the megalomaniacal, criminal and incompetent plebe as the dominating determination in the fate of Germany as a whole is done in exemplary fashion.  FM von Manstein is mentioned briefly, it is a shame that his strategic and moral opposition (nearly exclusive, in the sense of its frankness) was not fitted somewhere into the film -it would have given greater context of the overall situation and dire necessity to remove Hitler while the war in the East was still manageable- something which ceased to be possible following Operation Citadel, in conjunction with Manstein's effective dismissal.  This film achieves the kind of epically proportioned tragedy that this war truly embodies on so many different levels, for all combatants.

Yes, von Stauffenberg's son asked Cruise to leave his father's memory alone (*his being Scientologist the primary consideration here*), however, aside from his personal pomposity and plane strangeness of character, the von Stauffenberg of Cruise portrayed here is well done; no 'Vanilla Sky' Tom Cruise smooth cat persona exudes to the detriment of the role and film.  Hopefully there will be abundant extra footage to flesh out the picture more fully in a multi disc release. *

* And perhaps most importantly, the film is not the sort of guilt ridden, cultural Marxist (read: Germanophobic racism, in the Anglo-American liberal Progressivist tradition) apology and glorification of the participants of the failed coup.  Integral to this is Wolff's characer -ambivalently loyal to the regime, yet having been slighted by its petty bureaucratism, is prepared to lend support in true Machiavellian style, his cynical and potentially powerful hand to serve his detractors their just deserts.  He embodies the sort of full circle which Germany -and any other country under such conditions- can redeem itself: Wolf is the type of generically patriotic, prudently in awe of power and success of the restitution and expansion of the old Reich to Napoleonic proportions military man, of whom many millions of the post war generation would have shared similar passions and aspirations for their country.  Once the reigns disappear into the Jacobian abyss, with injustices and indignities mounting even against those truly loyal, he steps speculatively into the genuinely patriotic camp --though without a thought as to how the situation can be reversed at this late juncture.  The wrestling match of conscience is most waged in Wolf's mind, while the others are committed through strength of their moral instinct (with occasional, fatal intrusions of the instinct for self-preservation, a la Olbricht) -he must, and needs objectively the conditions that would quantify the necessity of making that same judgment: he understands most clearly that continuing the struggle in vain is preferable to becoming a figurehead of 'in vain' in the history of his country (a Benedict Arnold) and the world -for it only to end in death, when inevitable and objectively 'honorable' death awaits otherwise, together with the possibility of surviving the war if he continues to stay the course in his current position.  Ultimately, as many others on either side in the film, the inertia of events overwhelms the counter forces that would deny the inevitability of the 'historical dialectic' and the 'force of destiny', and assert enduring value standards against this tide.

Cruise also does a very good job portraying this pressured, injured, driven, very brave individual who risked all to do what he thought was best for his country and her people.

The movie is very well directed and pieced together.  If flows with the quality of masterful direction and editing.  The cast is top notch and very fitting across the board.

Even though this movie is a remake of an earlier one about Stauffenberg, this one focuses more on action than romance.

For the reasons why you must focus on Stauffenberg rather than the actor portraying him, read the controversies that this movie caused in Germany.  Germans regard Stauffenberg as a hero and they were disillusioned that some wagged out Scientologist had to play him in it.

What I would like to comment about and somewhat warn those thinking about the Blu-ray version of this film is that the audio levels and fluctuation there in may drive viewers a little batty.  What I mean is that for much of the film the dialogue is going to be quiet, almost at a whisper level.  That is as it should be since a lot of the activity is secretive discussion of treasonous plans, but.... well, there's a problem in that if you adjust the volume up so you can hear most of the dialogue when normal (non-whisper level) dialogue comes along it may nearly blast your ears.  Most certainly any explosions, thunder, or other noise will do the job and chase you out of the viewing area.

I wish this wasn't a problem here, and perhaps in a different home theatre configuration it might not be a problem at all, but I bring the problem up so that others might be forewarned.

In other aspects the Blu-ray is excellent.  Video quality is superb though the color scheme is primarily earth tones (military hues and browns and grays).  The color levels are good and the image is clean and clear.  Given that the film is 'new' it should be expected that the transfer would be pristine.

  Ahh, Tom Cruise. Even though you are somewhat of a weird individual, I have to respect your acting. It has elevated many movies like ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Minority Report"" from being mediocre sci-fi fare to great popcorn films. It's ok to be in love with Katie Holmes, and truly love Scientology, as long as your movies are good and entertaining, which is exactly what ""Valkyrie"" is. Directed by Bryan Singer, I was happy to get what I expected from the film, a good (not GREAT) thriller, involving true events during WWII. The story of the group of Nazi politicians and generals of the army trying to assasinate Hitler was a new one to me, and after doing some research, I can safely say that the film hit all the right facts. The acting by some major british actors is very well done, including a wonderful character by Bill Nighy. Singers direction emphasizes on the assassination plot rather than the characters of the film, so even though Cruise acted well enough, it wasn't worthy of an oscar. The production values were great, and the minor special effects used in the film fit the setting perfectly. If one watches this films with the expectations of a modern thriller based in a WWII setting, you will be plenty satisfied. I just wish they would've delved deeper into the mind of Cruise's character, Gen. Stauffenberg, which would have made the final scenes in the film much more memorable.

The Blu-Ray:
Video:
Well, this is definitely a good transfer, with some minor set backs. Colors are bold and spot-on, and blacks are nice, though not as inky as I'm used to. The only nit pick I had with this transfer was the obscurity of fine detail. I am used to seeing all of the individual strands of hair or the textures of uniforms, and in this BD, it was slightly lacking. Still, nit picks aside, this is a very good transfer.
4 out of 5.

Audio:
This DTS-HD MA packs a whallop. This is a dialogue driven film, and that is the only problem with the audio aspect, volume matching. At many times I had to raise the volume to understand the dialogue, and had to lower it since the bombastic moments were too loud. This takes away from the ""Movie"" experience. Other than that, everything else is dead on. Pans and directionality are crystal clear, and the bass, oh the bass. I watched the film with a couple of friends, and they all jumped when the bomb went off in the Wolf's Lair. Not a bad mix at all.

I, for one, did enjoy it very much. Tom Cruise, who is, by the way, a very good actor, did a wonderful job, as did the rest of the cast. There is very little  battle action in the film, but that's ok. War films are not always about the action, Sometimes they are about the humanity and compassion that can arise during all the chaos and madness. This movie has that, and then some. While it may be true that the German officers involved with the plot against Hitler did want to put themselves in a better position for a surrender, they were sickened by Hitler and his henchmen and the nasty things they were doing. These were soldiers whose job is to fight other soldiers, not women, children and old men. This movie portrays them as
human beings with families and a deep love for their country. Imagine the pain they must have felt as they plotted against the leader of the country, no matter how big a madman he was. So, my advice is to stop analyzing everything and enjoy the movie. It is, after all, a movie.",1243382400,6,1335,4.4048582995951415
3676108,3,B001KZIRKY,"I was expecting more from this movie. Although it probably followed the facts of the attempt on Hitler's life, it was pedantic and somewhat boring to me. Guess I'm too used to the fast paced shoot-em-up of todays' films, although I do enjoy factual historical films and have a large collection of war movies, some true some fiction.

This if not Tom Cruise's greatest work. He did a much better job in ""Collateral"" and ""A Few Good Men""",1243382400,,435,4.576923076923077
3676109,4,B001KZIRKY,"This Memorial Day I was thinking about the soldiers of past wars who placed their lives on the line in an attempt to preserve freedom for so many in this country. It seems as if we've used a holiday to salute them but as with many holidays it boils down to sales pitches and day long war film viewing. And it's always the same films. Now a new movie has a chance to be included in that group.

VALKYRIE is the true story about a group of high level German officers in World War II who determined that the only way to save their country was to assassinate Adolph Hitler. These were not the fanatical members of the SS or the Gestapo but every day soldiers who believed in their country who had realized far too late that Hitler was not the man they had hoped for.

The film opens with disillusioned Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) in Africa writing in his journal as he tries to obey orders while at the same time save his men. After finding a possible solution, they are attacked and the official who would help is killed and Stauffenberg is severely wounded, losing a hand, an eye and several fingers.

Returned to Germany, Stauffenberg is placed in a high level position. There, due to his vocal criticism of how things are going, he is recruited to replace a man recently found guilty of treason. General Olbricht (Bill Nighy) has been given the task to find the replacement and thinks he has found the man in Stauffenberg. Truth be told, he has.

A meeting Stauffenberg visits involving those plotting to take over reveals to him that while they have the desire, they don't have the plans in place to do so. Taking out Hitler is one thing, but what do you do afterwards? His research leads him to Operation Valkyrie, a plan set up to bring in the rear guard soldiers stationed in Germany to prevent a coupe or uprising. Once Hitler is killed, this plan goes into effect and the country is then run by whoever controls this army.

The plan is placed in motion, other members of the army are recruited for vital roles and the plan calls for Stauffenberg to detonate a time released bomb inside Wolf's Lair, the bunker Hitler gathers together with his generals to plan the war. A single explosion here would be enough to take out Hitler and many of those faithful to him.

As history has told us, this plan failed. Not because of its execution but due to numerous circumstances. Hitler's moving the meeting from the bunker to a cooler spot, the bomb being placed behind a heavy table plank preventing it from doing him damage, unstable fuses...all contributed.

Without certain knowledge that the bomb had killed Hitler, the organizers follow the lead of Stauffenberg and initiate Valkyrie. Given the time to get it going, the plot might have worked on that level alone, but unfortunately it failed.

Knowing the complete story before seeing the film doesn't detract from the drama that it provides. As I said at the beginning, we are witness to a group of determined men who risked their lives and those of their families to put an end to the rule of a madman. As soldiers they served their country, not Hitler. And when it was obvious that he was insane, they continued to serve their country by trying to take him out.

As an historical document the movie does a decent job of making us believe we are witness to the events as they unfold. Certainly the more dramatic moments where proclamations are yelled before executions are carried out might not be factual but they do inspire. And how does it stand as a movie? Only so so.

As viewers we are bombarded with fast paced images that hold our attention like a giddy schoolchild watching a silver ball bounce back and forth from flipper to bumper in the pinball game that is film. A slower paced film that unfolds slowly isn't likely to hold the attention these days unfortunately. I've often thought that if Alfred Hitchcock were making movies today he'd find himself unemployed. Fast pacing seems to be the rule of thumb now.

For those who are willing to set this aside and watch a good story unfold you'll be rewarded with this film. It not only tells a story that many should be made aware of, it does so as completely as two hours can and is executed to perfection by a cast of stand out actors that is second to none.

Director Bryan Singer made his mark with THE USUAL SUSPECTS and moved on to the super hero genre with X-MEN and SUPERMAN RETURNS. Here he shows he can tackle a real life story and make us interested while adhering to the tale at hand.

VALKYRIE is not a movie for frenetic MTV generation viewers. It is, however, a movie that has earned a spot on the Memorial Day movie list. It's not only the US soldiers that need remembered on those days. It is the men who tried to stop the war as well. And this group deserves credit for doing their best as well.",1243382400,18,4844,4.490909090909091
3676110,5,B001KZIRKY,"I went into this movie with reservations about its historical accuracy and how interesting it would be; plus I wasn't enthralled at the idea of watching Tom Cruise for ~2 hours (I freely admit, I don't like Tom Cruise much). I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie stayed very historically accurate and was at the same time very interesting; and Tom Cruise did a fantastic job, and was believable and even likable.
The story chronicles the last plot against Hitler's life by a group of very brave men and women. It's a fascinating story, even when you know it, and you can't help but cheer them on as they hope against hope, even when you know the outcome. The movie kept a quick, interesting pace, and successfully managed to be suspenseful -- which is a feat indeed when one considers that the audience knows that the plot failed!
I highly recommend this movie -- it's a winner on many levels. It's a great movie, it commemorates great, half remembered heroes, and, perhaps most surprisingly, it's a Tom Cruise movie that's actually worth watching! ;)",1243296000,13,1056,4.744565217391305
3676111,4,B001KZIRKY,"When most people think about WWII , they think about Hitler and rise of Nazism; polarization between european east and right political wing.  The truth is, that in Germany there were many citizens, soldiers and politicians who realized that Hitler was bad news for German people and the rest of the world, they were determined to put their own imprint on history by trying to resist to Hitler's regime, by orchestrating attempt on Hitler's life.  One of those it presented in this movie and as it happens it was the last attempt on Hitler's life.  Less than a year later, Hitler will commit suicide in his Berlin bunker.

Story is well told about the conspiracy of the high ranking officers to assasinate Hitler.  High ranking German officer, seriously wounded in Africa and of noble upbringing, creates a network of officers determined to create a new government that will negotiate end of war with allies, eliminate concentration camps and peacefully end the war.  Cast has some of the finest British and American actors and that is what falls short in the movie.  Perhaps movie would have been more authentic if it was made with German actors.  In any case, it is a good lesson in history for the new generations of young people who have heard about this was only in their history lessons.",1243209600,2,1292,4.762331838565022
3676112,3,B001KZIRKY,"You've got to admire the historical heart that writer/producer Christopher McQuarrie, director Bryan Singer, and star Tom Cruise bring to Valkyrie; in which Cruise stars as the scarred Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who becomes invited into, and eventually heads, an inside plot to kill Hitler (Rome's David Bamber).  Told mostly from Stauffenberg's and his crew's point of view, Valkyrie is clever and often engaging, but the moments of the film that are supposed to be suspenseful just end up coming up pretty empty.  The fact that Cruise is simply miscast as Stauffenberg doesn't help matters either, but what the film does manage to have going for it lies in its attention to detail, and the fact that it features a cast full of familiar faces from across the pond including Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Thomas Kretschmann, Kenneth Cranham, and an all too briefly seen Kenneth Branagh.  All in all, Valkyrie isn't a bad film one bit, and is definitely worth seeing for history buffs, but other than that, don't expect much out of it.",1243209600,,1066,4.977528089887641
3676113,5,B001KZIRKY,"I was not sure at first if I would care for this film, but it turned out to be an excellent depiction of a true story of WWII.  A group of German officers, disgusted with Hitler and what he  is doing to their country, decides to assassinate him, blame it on the SS, and take over.  They hatch a daring plan to set off explosives during a briefing.  The main man in all of this is Col. Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise.  Disregard Cruise's personal life and focus on his stoic, determined demeanor as a man who is risking everything to save the country he loves from a madman.

Nice production values also abound, with superb locations in Germany and crisp direction as well.",1243209600,6,681,4.408
3676114,4,B001KZIRKY,"I watched the Blu-ray version of this film on my son's gigantic TV, and I must say that I was blown away by the clarity of the images, especially when the cinematographer contrasted the prevailing grey of the uniforms with the blood-red flags (Some of these shots, in a miniature sense, were worthy of Leni Riefenstal).

I thought that the scenes set in the teletype pool were especially effective, with row upon row of women reading the copy, and one or more raising her hand tentatively when a message of importance came in for the officer-in-charge to scrutinize. In a movie about a wartime assassination plot, one doesn't ordinarily think about such matters as communication. This added detail contributed to the believability of the film, which hinges thematically on communication and its lack. The suspense derives from a sense of dread, knowing the outcome (Having stood in that ghastly room with the meat-hooks when visiting Berlin, I was really dreading the end, but the director handled the scene discreetly; hence the PG rating.).

Other than the always-handsome Tom Cruise, I had no idea who was in the cast since I could not read the elongated printing that is used on the back of DVD covers (and I had not read the reviews on Amazon). About a quarter of the way into the film, however, I exclaimed, ""Good Grief! Is that Kenneth Brannagh?"" (Not being one of his fans, my son had no idea.) Only a certain intonation of voice gave him away, since Brannagh, who looks about 20 pounds heavier than the last time I saw him, usually loses himself in whatever part he plays.

By the time the end credits rolled, I was astounded that other roles had been acted by Bill Nighy, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and Tom Hollander. I have admired each of them in many previous films, but the fact that they immersed themselves into their characters so deeply and seamlessly as to be unrecognizable attests to their ability as actors of the highest quality. i think I appreciated the film all the more because of their total anonymity.",1243209600,5,2032,4.7507082152974505
3676115,2,B001KZIRKY,"VALKYRIE should have been a lot better. It probably would have been a lot better if it had been made thirty years ago, when people still remembered World War II. It definitely would have been a lot better if an old school actor of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting played the lead. Without an Alpha Male in the lead, VALKYRIE just flounders.

Although Tom Cruise has some good work on his resume, like A FEW GOOD MEN and THE LAST SAMURAI, he just isn't the man to play Colonel Stauffenberg, the ringleader of the July 20, 1944 plot to kill Adolf Hitler. Cruise is boyish. He lacks character lines on his face. He isn't hard enough to be the killer of a mass killer.

VALKYRIE's biggest weakness, though, isn't Cruise, it's a go-nowhere script that lacks any suspense at all. History tells us the plotters failed, so the end is a foregone conclusion. Getting to the end is the dynamic part of this story. VALKYRIE just isn't dynamic. Its sonorous low energy all-talk no-action scenes between conspirators and its overall shuffling pace are enough to make you doze.

Although the film tries to portray Stauffenberg and his cohorts as heroes, it's important to remember that these men did nothing to free Germany for the length of the war until after D-Day when it became transparently clear that the war would be lost. They didn't hate Hitler as much as they just wanted a better deal for themselves.",1243123200,10,1398,4.629032258064516
3676116,4,B001KZIRKY,"It is an interesting story, though not particularly suspenseful. The opening of the movie had some great cinematic scenes, but then it quickly moved away from that and became more of a dramatic movie, minus the cinematic scenes. This was a big disappointment to me, for after all, though the story itself is quite interesting and perhaps a historical fact that most don't know, nonetheless, we know that the mission as it were failed. So I was hoping for some great cinematography, which I only saw in the opening minutes of the film.

The single disc version of the DVD does not contain any extras, I guess you have to buy the 2-disc set for that - a bit cheap in my opinion. I'm still rating this as 4 stars because I enjoyed watching the film, but I was a little disappointed with it as well. And I'm not sure it deserved as much hype as it got. Tom Cruise was okay in the film, but frankly I'd rather have a ""lesser known"" actor play this role - you don't need the Tom Cruise name & baggage to go along with a pretty tightly written and directed film.",1243123200,3,1055,4.328282828282828
3676117,3,B001KZIRKY,"With the DVD release of Valkyrie, I was particularly interested in such special features as actor/director commentary, interviews with surviving witnesses to events, and production notes.

It has been a long time since I bought the DVD of a major motion picture like Valkyrie and discovered there were no special features.  There is another version with two disks.  Marketing emphasizes this edition contains a digital copy for the PC, hence the extra disk.  That digital PC version gimmick has never appealed to me.  Also, the special 2-disk edition of Valkyrie costs about 45% more.  Almost TWICE as much for some unknowns.  What if the Tom Cruise commentary is goofy or one big yawn?

Based on the description on the cover of the DVD case, it was not completely clear whether the single disk version contained any special features or not.  There was to me a subtle implication that the extra disk was created and included to house the ""digital version"" for the PC.  Based on hundreds of previous DVD purchases, I wrongly assumed the other disk included the feature film and at least some of the usual ""extras"" most of us have come to expect with a DVD purchase.  Also, it is obviously more convenient if the features are accessible without getting up off the sofa.  That's what I get for thinking.

I took the chance on the regular version because I am cheap, and I don't like to buy stuff I won't use.  No question this is my own fault.  If I wanted to take a chance the extras would be awesome and life-changing, I should have spent the extra seven bucks.  Or rented it from Netflix.

It is hard to sell a DVD with this disclaimer: ""This DVD version contains no special features.""  From now on, if the disk doesn't clearly indicate special features, I'll assume there are none.  Knowing what I now know, I'd pass on buying either version of the DVD altogether.

Many fans of this film will be disappointed.  United Artists included no extras in the single disk version I bought.  Because of consumer expectations, the cover description should have been a little clearer. This studio is worse than Hitler.",1243123200,2,2109,4.720547945205479

3676119,4,B001KZIRKY,"This was a really good retelling of the failed assination attempt on Hitler. As complicated as the plot of the men involved was, the movie made it pretty easy to follow along and moved at a brisk pace. The suspense and build-up work very well , especially considering you see very little war action. Tom Cruise did very well playing the defiant Colonel although hearing him voice the lines in English was a bit weird at first, but short of learning German on the spot and using subtitles, not unexpected. I enjoyed this movie.",1243036800,5,526,4.6063829787234045

The movie engaged me from the beginning & even though I knew the ending, the movie was quite captivating & kept me up waiting to see what will happen. A very nice surprise.

Based upon the actual assassination plot against Hitler it does have some marks of a documentary, but that adds rather than detracts.  The cast is excellent.  Cruise underplays his role, which is surprising for him, but effective.  The supporting cast features many well known actors and they all bring their 'A' game.  I rented the single disk which lacked the documentary of the two disk set.  You will want to learn more after watching the movie so definitely get the two disk version.

It actually has a good story and im not even a big tom cruise fan but i felt he did a good job.

3676123,2,B001KZIRKY,"If your idea of a good movie is watching a bunch of Germans screaming at each other in German for two hours about the details of a bomb plot, driving around, ordering parts, writing letters, etc. - with all the emotional intensity of a block of wood - then this would be the perfect movie for you.

Hitler is barely in this movie.  In one of his few scenes, you are led to burn with the desire to see him die, because he asks to have his tea refreshed.  Hitler has a strong British accent.  15.99?  This movie isn't worth 1.99.  It is as if this were a movie about murdering a ghost, who you are not allowed to hear or see who is not even in the movie.

This flick stinks so badly that I feel sorry for the very existence of anyone who could be possibly be mindless enough and unfeeling enough to actually enjoy it.  Sad

I don't know if I can stand watching this movie again long enough to see if Hitler is really in it, somewhere.

Imagine a movie about Snow White, but the only way you know that the Queen is evil is because the egomaniac actress playing Snow White refuses to appear in the same movie with her.  You will then begin to have a better understanding of how this movie ever came to be I think.",1242950400,4,1209,4.1239316239316235
3676124,4,B001KZIRKY,"Bryan Singer, who directed 1995's oddly overrated ""The Usual Suspects"", was responsible for what was perhaps 2008's most underrated movie ""Valkyrie"". Based on the failed attempt to assassinate Adolph Hitler in 1944 (or, as the ads say, ""based on the incredible true story""), the movie follows Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg as he leads a conspiracy to blow up der Fhrer in his Wolfsschanze, putting von Stauffenberg and his family in jeopardy. (The wife of von Stauffenberg was pregnant at the time, a fact just hinted at here.) The film didn't fare well at the holiday box office, maybe because the release was poorly timed, but maybe because the moviegoing masses simply didn't know what it was all about. I understand a recent survey revealed the astonishing fact that a great number of people think the Germans were our allies in World War II! Hopefully,now that the DVD is released, the picture will be more readily available to a discerning audience. It's well worth seeing, intelligently written by Christopher MacQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, beautifully accompanied by John Ottoman's score, and well acted by the cast. In the central role of von Stauffenberg the American actor Tom Cruise is as effective as usual, and he is surrounded by some of the best British performers working today: Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard, Jamie Parker. A British character actor named David Bamber plays Hitler as a vague dumpy little man rapidly aging. Some people have objected to so many non-Germans playing German characters, but when the acting is so good why quibble about this type of ""authenticity""? I say Thank God they didn't use Teutonic accents. There is also a flurry of complaints about lapses in historical accuracy, but then ""Valkyrie"" is not pretending to be a stark documentary. As it is, the movie is a fine entertainment, expertly plotted and paced, and makes one curious to see what Bryan Singer will accomplish in the future.",1242950400,7,1980,5.058103975535168
3676125,4,B001KZIRKY,"How often does a movie entertain, keep in suspense (even when he knows the outcome), and inform the viewer all at the same time?  This is one of those rarities.  Tom Cruise plays Colonel von Stauffenberg, one of the leaders of the plot to kill Hitler, and plays him well.  I wouldn't have thought of Cruise in this role, but it works, and his resemblance to the real von Stauffenberg is uncanny.  Cruise isn't placid; rather his movie persona is tightly controlled as indeed von Stauffenberg must have been.  And yet he makes your emotions crackle when he tells his wife that if he fails in his assassination attempt, ""they"" will come for her and the children.  What a gutsy group these conspirators were, and it's high time their story was told in the cinema.

This is history made alive, and it's thrilling to see how the conspiracy shaped up, the arguments behind the scenes and the character foibles of the various conspirators.  You also get to see how incredibly charmed Hitler was to escape the assassination attempt, as he did so many other tries and coups--Beelzebub must have been his guardian angel.  What ""Valkyrie"" brings out so well is von Stauffenberg's logical look at post-Hitler Germany.  It wasn't enough to simply kill Hitler, but to also wrest control of Germany from Hitler's immediate underlings (such as Himmler) and the SS.  Valkyrie was Hitler's own plan to keep Germany under control in case of catastrophe, and in true ju-jitsu fashion von Stauffenberg tried to use his opponent's power against him.

This movie is yet another instance in which many paid reviewers simply missed the mark.  I'm irked by political correctsters who are always first on the bandwagon to find what they think are racist or otherwise politically incorrect flaws in a work--think of the scene in ""Borat"" in which the whites at the dinner party are accused of bigotry against Borat's black ""girlfriend,"" when in fact they were repulsed because she was a blatant whore.

But I'll break my own rule and speculate that one reason why the American mainstream reviewers so dopily criticized this movie was simply this: they didn't want Germans shown to be anything other than crazed Nazis marching Jews into ovens.  That there was a German resistance to Hitler might just be too much nuance for their bias to handle; it's so much easier to see the entire race as monocled, scar-faced knuckle-draggers.

The movie states at the end that there are 15 known attempts to overthrow or kill Hitler.  Why is this datum so little known?  (See above for possible answer.)  Why didn't FDR and Churchill aid and abet the conspirators, for as we now know they were aware of the German dissenters and yet refused to help them?  Michael Beschloss writes that FDR didn't want the Germans to settle into a conditional peace treaty, that he wanted to crush them to the earth once and for all, strip away all their supposed militaristic tendencies, and impose a stifling unconditional surrender upon them.

That is exactly what happened.  Unfortunately, FDR's intransigence helped cause World War II to go much farther than it had to, with millions more people killed than otherwise.  Thomas Fleming's ""The New Dealers War"" has much to say about America and England's ignoring of the anti-Hitler German resistance.

All the more reason to see this movie and get an idea of what courage might have looked like, and feel what these men felt who knew they could lose everything if they failed.",1242950400,4,3471,4.84406779661017

3676127,5,B001KZIRKY,"VALKYRIE deserves wider attention than it received during its theatrical release, a theater run mired by the media emphasis on the tacky behind the scenes stories of the making of the film and the character destruction of Tom Cruise.  This is a fascinating bit of World War II German history that is not as well known as the other aspects of the Third Reich and it bears telling.  Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have used the facts of the 15th unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler as spearheaded by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and molded a thriller and a classy drama populated by some of our finest actors. Director Bryan Singer manages to recreate Germany of 1944 and make it all look real - too real for comfort - and paces this complex mission with steady  and harrowing momentum.

The film belongs to Cruise who is rarely off screen. His acting is solid and credible.  The other actors whose presence gives the film a sense of realism are Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Tom Hollander, Jamie Parker, Carice van Houten, and David Bamber (excellent in the role of Adolf Hitler).  What makes this cast stand above the average ensemble crew is the sense of selflessness each actor brings to his/her role.  Even though many of these fine actors are only on the screen for moments, their contribution is so well crafted (and directed) that the audience feels as though each is fully understood as members of this infamous historic event.

This film appears to be an honest, non-sensationalized view of history about which too few people are informed.  As a quasi-documentary it holds up well: as a thrilling drama it deserves kudos.  Grady Harp, May 09",1242864000,4,1773,4.9393939393939394
3676128,4,B001KZIRKY,"I almost skipped this movie because of the negative buzz (from industry insiders before it opened)surrounding the project. I envisioned an overmatched Cruise chewing up the scenery as Europe went down in flames. This didn't happen and I'm glad I didn't listen to the naysayers. This movie delivers on all accounts: as a tense historical thriller,a popcorn action picture and an excellently acted ensemble piece. The reports on the death of Tom Cruise's career have been greatly exaggerated (first his comic highlight on Tropic Thunder and now this should put those talks to rest.) Director Bryan Singer strings the viewer along so well that one almost believes the film may end differently (I found myself saying, ""If only this or that had happened..."") In a time when Hollywood tends to overwhelm the viewer with sensory overload (CGI, loud sound effects, awful music), Valkyrie hits its target with a bullseye the old fashioned way: by sticking to the facts and concentrating on the story.

3676129,3,B001KZIRKY,"Its a shame that Cruise's lifestyle overshadows the important message of the film Valkyrie. For some reason, this is a little known story of WWII, about how a few people in the German army tried to do away with Hitler.

  Most people know nothing about this story (as well as not knowing who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - sheesh) and I'm kind of glad this movie was made. Technically, the film is very good: the sets, props and the acting. Resisting evil at all costs, even if the odds are against you, is something people need to learn today.",1242864000,6,549,4.47
3676130,4,B001KZIRKY,"The movie:

Valkyrie tells the tale of a plot to assassinate and overthrow the government of Adolph Hitler. By the time the war was winding down and Germany seemed to be on the losing side, many members of the military felt that suing for peace was the rational course - one that Hitler vehemently disagreed with, being set upon a disastrous ""fight to the end"" course which would end up claiming countless more lives.

Our protagonist in this drama is Count Claus Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), a young Catholic Colonel in the German army who is injured in Africa, losing a hand and an eye. Already weary of the war and disdainful of Nazi policies, he is recruited by the resistance led by General Edward Beck (Terence Stamp). Their idea: assassinate Hitler, and then use Hitler's own contingency plan, code-named ""Valkyrie,"" to take control of the government apparatus in Berlin and install economist/politician Carl Goerdeler as chancellor.

The film creates a palpable sense of tension, which is, alas, undercut by the sheer parade of guys in uniform who are not really explained or identified. I would consider myself at least an amateur student of the era, having read all 1150 pages of Shirer's ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich""... and I was still having a little bit of trouble following all the winding machinations of the plot and the players in it.

Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise. Never during the teleplay did I forget that I was watching Tom Cruise. Terence Stamp is very good, and most of the supporting players are fun to watch as well. There are, however, no real particular stand-out or ""scenery chewing"" performances. It's all very brisk and utilitarian.

Overall, this is a fine movie, but not the kind of period film that really whisks you away to a new time and place (like ""The Aviator,"" ""Zodiac"" or ""Milk""), or has you at the edge of your seat (like ""The Dark Knight""). It's moderately entertaining. History buffs will find a lot to like. The average movie-goer will probably come away thinking ""yep, those Nazis were pretty bad."" Which is too bad, because the message of the film is that there were many Germans who resisted, despite how it might seem to the outside world.

The Blu-Ray:

Any criticism of ""Valkyrie"" is directed only at the film itself - the Blu-Ray is phenomenal. We are presented with a 1.78:1 image (i.e. one that fills a widescreen TV) that possesses exceptional detail. Dust motes after an explosion are visible. Fine facial lines, strands of hair, beads of sweat. The textures of wood, leather, gravel. Beautiful forests and airfields. It's really a top-notch HD experience. Particularly nice is the light but easily apparent film grain that permeates the transfer - thankfully not washed away by excessive digital noise reduction, which gives ""Valkyrie"" a nice film-like appearance on Blu-Ray. Audio is fine as well, with booming explosions, echoing shouts and ""heils,"" all very nicely rendered in the surround space.

What truly amazes me are the quality of the extras - a 2 hour documentary is included, in 1080p, explaining the backdrop of the period. It is quite informative. Also included are commentaries, making of segments, and the like. It's amazing that the film looks so good even though there are essentially 4.5 hours of 1080p HD all on one disc. I guess they really used the 50gb capacity of Blu-Ray to its fullest here. It's so nice not to have extras banished to a second disc. Kudos!

********

Overall, this is a solid genre flick for fans of WWII drama. Those unfamiliar with the setting may be a bit lost during the proceedings, but a fine set of extras will fill them in if they devote the time to them. This is not a classic that will have you thinking about it for days afterward, or have your palms sweating with tension as you watch. But it's a good film that should find an audience with such a solid HD presentation to back it up. The a/v quality is top shelf, and could easily be used as ""demo"" material to impress friends or customers who are dubious of the benefits of Blu-Ray.",1242864000,10,4057,4.741843971631206
3676131,4,B001KZIRKY,"There have been five versions of `Valkyrie' told on screen in the last twenty years.  1990 had the excellent Brad Davis in ""The Plot To Kill Hitler"", 2004 had ""Operation Valkyrie"" by Sebastion Koch and 2008 produced two films, ""Killing Hitler:  The True Story Of The Valkyrie Plot"" and ""Operation Valkyrie: The Stauffenberg Plot To Kill Hitler"".  For those interested, the word valkyrie is derived from `old horse' valkyrja (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb kj&oacute;sa (meaning ""to choose""). Together, the words mean ""chooser of the slain.""  A word chosen by Hitler himself.  The story tells of the 1944 attempt by several High Command German Officers to asassinate Hitler and take over control of the German government.  Colonel Stauffenberg led a resistance group who managed to plant a bomb in Hitler's battlefield headquarters.  The bomb went off.  We all know how Hitler really died.

Now this year we have ""Valkyrie"" starring a host of grand actors like, Tom Wilkinson, Terrance Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Eddie Izzard. Hitler is played to perfection by a lesser-known actor named David Bamber.  All sport British/German accents, which helps the credibility of the story.  Then we have Tom Cruise as Colonel Stauffenberg.  He is horrendously and miserably miscast.  The beginning of the film has a Tom Cruise sound-alike German voice speaking that tries to slowly evolve into Cruise's American voice.  It's as big a bomb as the one that goes off in Hitler's bunker.

The direction by Bryan Singer is, of course, well done with first class cinematography and surround sounds of explosions and gunfire.  All the acting is first rate, except for Tom Cruise who rarely raises his voice and looks meek and stoic throughout the film.  I am sorry to bash Mr. Cruise, but he is just terribly miscast.  He shows little emotion, drive or passion.  Brad Davis in the 1990 version was excellent, showing a wide range of emotions, especially towards the plot, his companions and his family.  In fact, Davis successful changes his accent even if it isn't perfect German or British.

The Singer film is perfectly adequate, but I found myself sighing every time Cruise appears on film (and not the good kind of sighing).  Singer does manage to be faithful to the original story, only changing some scenes to highlight Cruise.  Many of the scenes of the Stauffenberg house, the bunker in the forest and others are identical and it manages to feel like WWII Germany (it was filmed there), but the ending set-up seems contrived, even if it is true.  The Stauffenberg family was imprisoned and released a few years later, something not noted in the Singer film.

If you have never heard the story, it is an amazing part of history.  The supporting cast couldn't be better and Director Singer knows how to handle suspense and the horrors of war.  However, Tom Cruise is simply ""Risky Business"" Tom Cruise in a German uniform.  He is completely out of place.  Enjoy the film with that warning.",1242864000,3,3014,4.924603174603175
3676132,5,B001KZIRKY,This movie stays almost perfectly true to the actual historical events.  I thought Tom Cruise did an excellent job and the movie was well cast overall.  If your a WWII buff like I am you will enjoy this movie.,1242864000,3,209,4.333333333333333
3676133,4,B001KZIRKY,"I admit I was initially put off watching this movie by all the negative critics' reviews, but I'm a fan of WW II dramas, especially those focused on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust and could not resist watching this when it was released on DVD.

To my surprise, I truly enjoyed the movie and found it was a historically accurate portrayal of the actual events to do with the 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Tom Cruise is credible in his role as Col. Claus von Stauffenberg whose deep-seated disgust at the Fuhrer's leadership and the atrocities perpetrated by the SS has him resolved to put an end to the Fuhrer's reign of terror. Much has been said about Cruise's use of an American accent throughout this film. Admittedly, it is jarring to hear Cruise speak with an American accent whilst portraying a German officer, and this appears even more awkward when his co-stars speak in British accents. That being said, I think this has more to do with viewers expectations - we are used to hearing German accents used in wartime movies, and ""Valkyrie"" sort of bucks that trend. However, as some reviewers have noted, not all Germans speak English with a pronounced German accent.

Accent concerns aside, I thought the movie was well-paced without sacrificing attention to period details or historical facts. The movie depicts events as it happened in real life, and the director, Bryan Singer needs to be commended for that. All the main characters played their roles convincingly, i.e. Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg, Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as General Fromm, Terence Stamp as Ludwig Beck, Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow etc. It's a star-studded cast and yet the other appealing aspect of this movie is that there wasn't one actor dominating the movie. Cruise shares the spotlight with the other major players, a refreshing change from some other Cruise-dominated movies.

This is not an action flick in the traditional sense - there's no real action [unless you count mass mobilization of German troops as action] per se, but what keeps viewers on the edge of their seats is the suspense [even when one is privy to what eventually happens] that is maintained throughout.

Final verdict: ""Valkyrie"" will appeal to those who appreciate WW II dramas that focus more on character development and storyline than pure action.",1242777600,3,2365,4.949622166246852
3676134,4,B001KZIRKY,"Movies about history are a risky business because the viewer already knows the outcome, so the trick becomes to make a compelling, riveting drama that gets the viewer to forget he knows what's going to happen and get him to sit on the edge of their seats as the events unravel and reveal history before their eyes. Valkyrie succeeds in this magnificently.

Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise as Claus Von Stauffenberg, a Colonel in the German Army, but he has a strict code of morals that's different than Hitler's Germany. Stauffenberg was worried about the German people and a regime that was killing 16,000 daily. After suffering horrific wounds in North Africa Stuaffenberg is assigned to be an adjutant of Hitler's. Upon arriving in Berlin he is recruited into a secret group of like minded high ranking German officers who want to remove Hitler from power and put him on trial. Stauffenberg develops Operation Valkyrie, a plan to assassinate Adolph Hitler, it was a brilliant plan, take over the  army reserve, the  National Guard would be our equivalent, and lead them to think that after they assassinate Hitler, a radical faction of the SS was trying to seize power, and that Stauffenberg would appear to be supporting Hitler's government until it was too late and they had control of the government. Stauffenberg plants a bomb in the room where Hitler is having a staff meeting, he is able to get out of the meeting just before the bomb goes off, and he witnesses the room being blown to bits but he isn't sure if Hitler is dead. He makes it back to Berlin to put Operation Valkyrie into effect, and discovers his co-conspirators haven't done very much to put the plan into effect because General Olbricht (Bill Nighy) has lost his nerve due to almost being caught in a previous attempt. As Valkyrie is put into action they secure SS and Gestapo barracks not only in Berlin but Paris and Prague. Word starts to get out that Hitler wasn't killed but the conspirators keep going because they've gone to far to stop and because if they can secure Berlin they can isolate Hitler and his cronies and remove them from power. The plan almost succeeds until dual orders come to arrest Goebels and Stauffenberg and which orders the German soldiers choose to obey and why.

Every few movies Cruise proves he's an actor by turning in a good performance, and the whole cast turn in performances that fill in the blanks of dry history and give breath to the characters and dramas that make up history.

While there isn't a whole lot of range in Cruise's Stauffenberg, this isn't a wooden performance Stauffenberg is first and foremost a soldier and his demeanor reflects that. The whole cast turns in good performances from Kenneth Branagh, although I was disappointed he wasn't used more, Terence Stamp as General Beck who the conspirators are looking to make the new leader of Germany, Tom Wikinson as General Fromm who was aware of the conspiracy but neither encouraged it nor turned the conspirators in, and Bill Nighy as the indecisive General Olbricht.

As I Watched this movie I had some interesting reactions to what was going on. On the one hand Stauffenberg and the other conspirators are trying to do the right thing for their country and humanity, but they're also committing treason.",1242777600,3,3287,4.788359788359788

It's a historically-faithful film to  what really happened, so that's a big plus. Most times, much of these ""based on a true event"" stories are mostly fiction. Not here.

Anyway, what people with Blu-Ray players want to know is how does this look and sound?  It looks very good and sounds terrific.  The colors are rich and most scenes are very sharp. A few are slightly soft but I think those were intentional.  Overall, it's a pretty film with very little CGI.  All the production values are excellent in re-creating the period.

The sound was particularly impressive considering there was very little action. Most of it takes place in the beginning of the film. Most of the movie is talk, but you can hear voices out of all speakers and get terrific surround sound on odd things like a room full of typewriters clicking away.

3676139,3,B001KZIRKY,"Tom Cruise battles his childhood enemy in a valiant attempt to reassert his box-office reputation.

Valkryrie was the code-word for the secret plot near the end of World War II organized by German Army officers to assassinate Adolph Hitler, leader of Germany and the Third Reich. The historical drama is based on a true story obviously aimed at males 25 - 54 years old.

As we know, Hitler was not assassinated and later committed suicide with his girlfriend Eva Braun in an underground bunker as the American and Russian armies raced into Berlin, capital of the Third Reich.

So what is this film? A tragedy? A study of failed ambition? In reality, simply a slick, suspense thriller which casts Tom Cruise as an All-American hero willing to risk his life to save the world from the evil villain.

Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the Wermacht (German Army) officer who led the assassination plot. Along with several other German Army officers ---played in the film by British actors--- von Stauffenberg wants to eliminate Hitler and end the war, which Germany is losing. Cruise said during pre-theatrical release that as a child he always wanted ""to kill Hitler.""

Director Brian Singer revises history to make Cruise a super-hero. Valkyrie was a meticulously planned operation which almost succeeded. Christopher McQuarrie's and Nathan Alexander's script presents Valkyrie as a seriously-flawed plot with little chance of success unless Cruise can overcome numerous obstacles and singlehandedly save the world.

Instead of being a deeply disechanted German engulfed with anguish for German youth being sacrificed by a psychotic meglomaniac, Cruise plays a Hollywood superhero caricature. In spite of his acting experience, Cruise does not portray anguish or disenchantment. All he gives is a stern stare.

Moreover, this film suffers from convoluted casting. Von Staffenberg's co-conspirators are played by British actors Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp, who deliver their lines with British accents while Cruise rants in American English. Meanwhile, Thomas Kretschmann, the German actor playing Hitler, delivers his lines in English with a German accent.

Obviously, viewers for the sake of entertainment have to forsake reality in favor of fantasy and of course ignore history. The bomb attempt against Hitler during July 20, 1944 did not succeed. Hitler in retribution had all conspirators executed. Those facts seemingly would undermine any reason to a produce a big-budget film sixty-four years after the insignificant event.

This film was simply a vehicle for Cruise to re-establish his box-office presence after being publicly dumped from a long-term contract by Paramount Pictures following public rants about Sciencetology and psychology. This was Cruise's first film under the United Artists banner, which he is part-owner. MGM, owner of the United Artists name, distributed the film.

Although well-produced, you have to be a Tom Cruise or World War II fan to endure this slick, superficial thriller. But, apparently there are many who adore Cruise or still hunger for another World War II film. Valkyrie grossed $198,107,000 during it's first sixteen weeks of worldwide theatrical release, with foreign markets collectively far outperforming the U.S. box office.

Don't buy or rent if you plan on watching with wife or girlfriend, unless you know she is a Tom Cruise fan. Forsake the single disc version and buy or rent the double-disc DVD or Blu Ray editions which have dual commentary tracks. The production-oriented track features director Brian Singer, Tom Cruise and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie while the history-oriented track features McQuarrie and his co-writer Nathan Alexander. Also, included are two informative production oriented featurettes.

If you have a high-definition television, the Blu Ray version is far superior to the standard DVD. The Blu Ray transfer and audio tracks are excellent.

I would have given this film 2.5 stars because Cruise doesn't do anything for me and the event is insignificant if not immaterial. Plus, the script is contrived and, who needs to spend two hours watching another irrelevant World War II film. But, the film and Blu Ray version are very well-produced.",1242432000,8,4257,5.373873873873874
3676140,4,B001KZIRKY,"Based upon actual historical events, VALKYRIE is a cinematic portrayal of the German Operation Valkyrie, a subversive plot against Hitler's Germany by a group of Nazi insiders.  Tom Cruise stars as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.  Stauffenberg is a distinguished and decorated officer, but secretly hates Hitler.  After loosing an eye, a hand, and some fingers during combat operations in Tunisia, Stauffenberg is approached by the German Resistance.  They know of his dislike for Hitler's regime and believe that his new post places him in the perfect position for an intended coup.  Using ""Operation Valkyrie"", a contingency plan originally approved by Hitler that allowed the Ersatzheer (replacement army) to take control of the country if there was a internal breakup of the high command, as a blueprint Stauffenberg and the Resistance begin planning how to kill Hitler and take Germany back.

Even though I enjoy history, I have to admit that before seeing VALKYRIE, I was unaware of ""Operation Valkyrie"".  I knew that there had been many assassination attempts on Hitler's life, but I did not know about the brave Stauffenberg, Valkyrie, and the almost successful coup of Hitler's Germany.  I thought the film did a good job of bringing the story to the screen in an interesting and exciting way.  If the only reason you haven't watched this movie is because you already know the outcome of the operation, please reconsider.  People flocked to TITANIC even though everyone knows the ship sunk, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID is a great movie even though we know the leads disappear and are probably killed in Bolivia, etc.  Sure we already know ahead of time that ""Operation Valkyrie"" fails, but that doesn't make VALKYRIE any less compelling.

Acting-wise, VALKYRIE has some great performances.  Tom Cruise illustrates once again that he's a better actor than he would sometimes like the world to believe and seems perfect as lead man Stauffenberg.  However, VALKYRIE is really an ensemble picture and everyone else in the picture does a fine job, too.

There are some who think it unusual that the characters speak in English with no German accents.  Personally, I found this refreshing.  I'm not sure where the idea originated that people of different countries have to speak in an English film with an accent reflecting their country of origin, but it's a convention that I'm glad isn't used in this movie.  I hope that future historical films such as this follow suit and we could get rid of bad accents in historical movies altogether.

As far as historical accuracy goes, as I mentioned before, I didn't know much about ""Operation Valkyrie"" before seeing the movie. However, since then, I have done some research and it seems that VALKYRIE does an excellent job of sticking to historical truth.  There are some events, scenes, and dialogue that have been changed, edited, or extended for dramatic or pacing purposes, but the essence of the story is kept and many of the historical facts of the events are adhered to.  The props, set designs, and costumes are extremely accurate.  Also, it should be noted if for no other reason, VALKYRIE is a movie worth watching because its one of only a few films ever to be allowed to film on location at the Blenderblock in Berlin.

I really enjoyed VALKYRIE.  I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I know he can be a pretty good actor.  I also enjoy watching historical pictures.  The film kept me engrossed and was so interesting that it led me to do some historical research afterwards.  With that said, there is quite a bit of dialogue in the movie.  In fact, much of what occurs between the opening scene and the final act of the movie is dialogue.  I didn't mind that so much, but there are some people who might find all that talking (but great dialogue and discussion) to be drab and boring.

The regular edition DVD includes just the movie with only a few trailers as extras.  The special edition DVD is the one you probably want to buy as it includes two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette, a documentary from the History Channel entitled ""The Valkyrie Legacy"", and a digital copy of the film for your personal computer.",1242432000,4,4188,4.8645980253878705
3676141,4,B001KZIRKY,"In the third leg of rehabbing his image, Tom Cruise does an agreeable WWII thriller as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the Nazi soldier who implemented the final attempt at assassinating Hitler. ""Valkyrie"" is a tight drama that is a bit too tame to be super-suspenseful, but does do well as a character study. Cruise is effective as Col Von Stauffenberg, a wounded and already jaded soldier who falls in with the plotters after a disabling injury in battle.

Even though the history is well known, the cast does a good job at showing the problems involved (being bureaucrats being the worst offense) in their mission, and the stakes involved after the plot fails. The supporting cast is excellent (especially Eddie Izzard). As for the carping about accents, this is a non-issue to me. What did you want, everyone sounding like Col Klinck? It didn't detract from the story to me at all.

Worth an eventual rental if only to watch Cruise straining to be taken seriously again (after his terrific comic turn in ""Tropic Thunder"" and a lame political thriller ""Lions for Lambs""), ""Valkyrie"" makes for a good hisstorical time waster.",1242172800,,1127,4.895287958115183
3676142,1,B001KZIRKY,"They got the history part right but as for an entertaining movie, they failed. You never really get into the movie because of it's inaccuracies. Listening to german officers & soldier speaking in british/american accents was unrealistic, you don't need to speak perfect german or even a strong german accent but when you have supposedly german officers/soldiers speaking in clear british/american accents, realism completely falls out the window. In the movie ""Schindler's list"" they spoke in english but atleast in strong german accents so it didn't seem to fake, and look at how well that movie turned out.

Does Valkyrie make you feel like you just witnessed a part of history? Like the experience you got when you saw schindler's list, the pianist, or saving private ryan? No. It falls short of any realism or authenticity to the point where it just becomes dull and boring. It just tells you what went down in one of the many failed assassination attempts of Adolf Hitler in english and american accents, and honestly I found it more interesting on the history channel.

The whole thing comes across as annoyingly artificial: Cruise's laughably stodgy impersonation of a senior Wehrmacht officer, the mix of US/British accents, the immaculate sets filled with nazis in starched uniforms (hard to believe everyone and everything looked so spotless in 1944 Berlin). And Bryan Singer's directing is clumsy and uninspired, recycling the same visual cues over and over (do the test and look at this movie with the sound turned of; you'll notice how this whole narrative shrivels to a sequence of people picking up phones, opening envelopes and driving cars). I thought Carice Van Houten's commendable performance as von Stauffenberg's wife was the only, modest, highlight of the film. Not only is this an actress with a very striking appearance, she was the only character in the film that looked and acted believably ""German"". I'll watch out for her in other movies.

3676145,5,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie, the latest Tom Cruise actioner, is an almost perfect political thriller. It is about the 1944 nearly successful attempt to assassinate Hitler toward the end of WWII, which Cruise's character, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, heads up. It's been awhile since I've seen such impeccable sets and costumes, heard such a pounding score, enjoyed such a stellar cast, and witnessed such excellent filmmaking, not to mention the really good, nail-biting story. Although we all know the outcome - Hitler survives, only to commit suicide nine months later - it will still have you on the edge of your seat. For those unfamiliar with the name, Valkyrie is a Wagnerian opera after which Hitler named his secret operation for protecting Germany and her occupied territories in the event something happened to him. (Even in death he was a control freak.)

If you like military films, this one is top-notch, with some terrific reproductions of German aircraft. The story opens with von Stauffenberg stationed in North Africa with the Afrikakorps, reflecting in his journal how he'd like to do something about Hitler. (Not a safe thing for a German officer to write in his journal, but it says volumes about who von Stauffenberg was.) When his unit is attacked by Allied planes, von Stauffenberg ends up in a military hospital missing one hand, two fingers and an eye. From there he is moved to Berlin, where he is recruited by a ring of conspirators out to assassinate Hitler and establish a new government.

It doesn't take long for the Colonel to take over the operation: he's a strong leader, exuding active commitment, integrity, moral courage and - if I may extrapolate - faith. How he manages to get into the confidence of Hitler and almost pull off the greatest coups in history is remarkable. Through this film, we get a very authentic view of what those who opposed Hitler were doing behind the scenes in Nazi Germany in 1944. Interestingly, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was the spiritual leader for this group, though, regretfully, he does not appear as one of the characters.

Every aspect of this production is superb, including the special effects and action sequences, and particularly the explosion designed to kill Hitler in his secret headquarters, known as Wolf's Lair. The performances are top-drawer. Besides Cruise, who never seems to age and for whom this is the perfect vehicle, I was especially impressed with Bill Nighy (Pirates Of The Caribbean), who plays General Friedrich Olbricht, the main officer in cahoots with von Stauffenberg; Tom Wilkinson (Batman Begins), who plays General Friedrich Fromm, the officer in charge of initiating Valkyrie; Dutch actress Carice van Houten as von Stauffenberg's wife, Nina; and German actor Thomas Kretschmann (Eichmann, King Kong) as Major Otto Ernst Remer, the officer in charge of carrying out Valkyrie.

I wasn't especially taken by Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Major-General Henning von Tresckow, von Stauffenberg's predecessor in the assassination plot, even though Branagh gets second billing to Cruise. Nor did I like David Bamber's version of Adolf Hitler (a difficult character to play) - he seems too old, weak and vulnerable to be the leader of the Third Reich. Historians will have to decide if that was accurate. On the other hand, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard and Kevin McNally render their characters well as fellow conspirators.

Just a word about three common criticisms of the film that I have heard. The first is that Valkyrie doesn't deal with the Holocaust. That's because it wasn't about the Holocaust - a myopic criticism. The second is that the actors didn't use German accents. That's because everyone in the film is German. German's don't have accents to each other. The only reason for using accents in a film is when there are other nationalities involved, and you're wanting to differentiate between them - an idiotic criticism. The third is that Cruise wasn't a good choice for von Stauffenberg. Actually, he was the perfect choice. Not only does he look exactly like von Stauffenberg, he probably has his personality. If all Cruise had done was play Cruise, he would have been perfect - a prejudiced criticism. All of these criticisms are unfounded.

This film is way, way overdue. We haven't seen nearly enough about the courage of the German people who tried to resist Hitler. I hope there will be many more to follow. Although I didn't count on Hollywood to do the right thing at Oscar time - they didn't - Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns) deserved to be nominated for Best Director; Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander deserved the nomination for Best Screenplay; and all the production crew needed to be recognized for their outstanding work. Valkyrie is that good. But if you don't like war films or political thrillers, don't waste your time. This is filmmaking the old fashioned way, with story and acting taking center stage. They don't make them like this very often, so please don't miss this outstanding film.

3676146,2,B001KZIRKY,"With this film, much of modern German history is explained. Cruise and Co. may have found these Germans to be worthy of our respect and admiration; they are no doubt worthy of respect at some level, but I was surprised at their ineptness and saw for the first time why the German High Command got shafted by the little  Corporal. They were as Hitler himself accused them: rather tame and gutless, weren't they? They really couldn't take action, neither against the Russians nor against Hitler. they were complacent. Cruise tries hard to convey a German in command, but I found Crusie rather lame. He is not good at filling the shoes of men of substance; that's why ihe is so good playing silly CIA types in Mission-Impossible. He is at his best when dressed as a jewel thief rather than as an officer. The film itself is a bore, and not because we know the ending. The writing is flat. And where is the greatest comic figure of the twentieth century? A Hitler film without Adolf? The grim reaper figure portrayed has nothing going for him. Where is Anthony Hopkins when we need him? This was surely a missed opportunity. Had Hitler been anything like the man portrayed herein, I would have voted for him myself. My god, he looked responsible compared to Cruise and his set of disorganized, trembling clowns. No, this was a missed opportunity.",1239494400,4,1342,4.662447257383966
3676147,3,B001KZIRKY,"I saw this movie in theaters because I heard that the movie had a great story.  The movie centers around Claus von Stauffenberg, who organizes an unsuccessful coup against Hitler in an attempt to overthrough the Nazi regime.  In fairness, von Stauffenberg's actions, as well as other instances of Nazi resistance, do hold a special place in time and provided some stories that are worth being shared.  The story alone was a huge driving force as to why it was a half-way decent film.

Yet there was a lot about the film that prevented me from getting into it.  For starters, the film didn't have an authentic feel to it and felt less like a retelling of a historical event and more like an excuse for some British people and Americans to run around pretending to be in Nazi Germany.  The other thing was the overwhelming obvious fact that Hitler died of suicide, so you're left watching a movie that you know isn't going to end with von Stauffenberg being successful.

(I joked that the Cliff's Notes movie would be something to the effect of: ""Quick, we must stop Hitler!  Yay, we blew Hitler up!  Wait, Hitler died of suicide, what happened to us?  (scene cuts to the gallows) Oh..."")

Be that as it may, the movie wasn't that bad and is recommended for fans of either war or history movies as long as you aren't expecting something with the cultural impact of Schindler's List.",1239321600,4,1380,4.591836734693878
3676148,4,B001KZIRKY,"Valkyrie, the latest film from noted director Bryan Singer, is a film that sets out to prove there were good Germans during the Third Reich. In that it largely succeeds. It also sets out to revive Tom Cruise's somewhat stalled career. In that... well, time will tell. It always does, as the Doctor once said.

The movie focuses on the formation of a plot to kill Hitler using Operation Valkyrie, a plan originally drafted to maintain law and order in the Reich in the event of Allied bombings destroying Berlin. The plotters, led by Claus von Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise, planned to use Valkyrie as a way to round up the SS and take control of the government after assassinating Hitler.

The July 20 plot to kill Adolf Hitler was one of fifteen that failed to do so over the years (I do hope I'm not spoiling the movie for you by pointing out he doesn't die). Knowing that Hitler survives makes this movie less about his assassination and more about how close the coup plotters came to success, even though the Fuher lived. Before the plot began to fall apart, we see that they'd managed to take over the government quarter, arrested much of the SS heirarchy and were about to arrest Goebbels (something his children, in retrospect, might've appreciated). In the end, in fact, the only thing that caused the coup to fail was the fact that, well, Hitler wasn't dead. Ooops.

It's interesting for someone like me, who loves history and enjoys reading alternate history, to ponder how things might've gone different had the plot worked. Had Hitler died, had the plotters been more on the ball and moved faster, or even, heck had the other plot shown in the movie worked, just what would've happened? (for the record, I believe the Allies would've negotiated with a new government, but Stalin would've demanded territorial concessions, like, for example, Poland, which might've caused the whole thing to collapse)

The movie is tense and entertaining. The fact that it was shot in Germany lends a nice authenticity to the movie that is spoiled only by the fact that none of the leads has a German accent. The pacing is good, the sets are great, etc, etc.

Ah, but you want to know about Tom Cruise, right? Well, I'm not a fan of his work in general. I find him to be very overrated and, in fact, one of the only things I've seen him in that I really enjoyed was Tropic Thunder.

But that said his performance in this movie is adequette. It's not anything to write home about, but it's ok. It gets the job done. Workman-like. Nothing special.

Despite that, and even if you aren't a Cruise fan, I recommend this movie. If nothing else, it highlights a part of German history most people outside Germany are unaware of, and does so in an entertaining way. No bad thing, that.",1239148800,2,2781,4.606060606060606
3676149,4,B001KZIRKY,"Of the many films dealing with WWII or specifically the Nazis--this would have to be the most under-rated!!  Despite the miscasting of Tom Cruise in the lead role of Von Stauffenberg, an aristocratic German soldier (Jeremy Irons or Harrison Ford would've supplied the gravitas), this film is still gripping entertainment--and I didn't see anybody leaving the theater when I saw this over the Xmas holidays.  Perhaps the timing or the controversy surrounding Cruise's affliation with Scientology may have hurt the movie but a superb supporting cast of mainly Brits (Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branaugh,Bill Nigby, and Terrence Stamp) plus Bryan Singer's crisp direction keep your interest on high throughout.

For those that disagree well thats your own opinion. Before this film was released they had a history channel episode on the plot to kill hitler. It gave a good set up of what exactly the film was leaning towards. So for those that went to see it and were disappointed.. well thats your own fault, if you watched the episode you would have never wasted your money on seeing Valkyire. The real reason for them blending the German in the beginning and then making it into english, was that most americans would be to bored to be reading subtitles throughout the film. Their original plan was to make it all in German, but since the film had a lot of depth and lengthy scenes when they were ploting to kill hitler, they decided it would be best to just keep to standards. Another reason they didn't have even german accented actors, because they needed more well rounded actors especially Tom Cruise to get a lot more people to see it. Other then all the minor things they had to do to get more people to go see the film, it kept to a good feel towards what actually happened. Really when looking at it there would have been people annoyed with the outcome of the film either way. All opinionated honestly.

Excellent film,great acting by the entire cast & very good historically correct props,architecture & scenery. .A real edge of your seat thriller. I went to theatre on December 26th,day after it opened & even with the Christmas holiday weekend,it was still quite full. People were focused at the screen & not distracted. I was interested in this movie soon after I heard it got the green light for production,even before the cast was announced.

If some go to this and are expecting an 'action movie' & go away disappointed & bashing it,that's not what the movie is about. It is an historical thriller,with all the characters,places & events actually occuring during those turbulent years in Europe. There is very little 'action'compared to most over the top stuff that comes from Hollywood today,but plenty of intelligent dialogue,interaction between characters & suspense to rival any great Hitchcock film IMO.

Am looking forward to the DVD release,will be nice to see the bonus features especially  details behind the production etc.",1237593600,2,1115,5.115384615384615
3676152,2,B001KZIRKY,"First off, I agree with those critics who found Tom Cruise utilizing an American accent while the other actors are all speaking in polished British accents, a big mistake. The film's verisimilitude is compromised quite a bit by Cruise's inability to convince us that he's truly Klaus von Stauffenberg, a sophisticated Army officer from an aristocratic German family.

That said, Valkyrie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's basically a by-the-numbers recreation of the last plot to kill Hitler. While it lacks suspense (since the film's climax is a forgone conclusion) it does ably depict who the players were and how they concocted and carried out the failed assassination plot.

Valkyrie fails in the area of character development. We never get to know any of these characters as multi-dimensional human beings. Director Bryan Singer chose to tell his story purely as an action-adventure movie. On the plus side, the movie looks like it was filmed at some of the actual locations especially the scenes shot at the ""Wolf's Lair"" which looked pretty realistic.

The most objectionable aspect of 'Valkyrie' is elevating von Stauffenberg to hero status. While certainly he was courageous, he was no hero. Had Germany been winning the war, it's not likely there would have been as many assassination attempts as there were. I find it difficult to believe that most of the conspirators were primarily motivated by a moral imperative.

Daniel Goldhagen, in his brilliant book ""Hitler's Willing Executioneers--Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust"", informs that von Stauffenberg's own brother admitted that in the sphere of internal politics, ""we had welcomed the basic tenets of National Socialism for the most part...The concept of race seemed sound and very promising."" Their objection was merely that its ""implementation was exaggerated and carried too far"". Stauffenberg's uncle, Count Uxkull, stated ""We should hold on to the concept of race as far as possible.""

According to Goldhagen, one of the central documents of the resistance to Hitler, prepared at the beginning of 1943 by leading Protestant theologians and university professors, explicitly condemned genocide but still argued that Jews caused trouble for Germany, that a ""Jewish Problem"" existed, that the Jews had harmed Germany and that a ""solution"" was necessary that would prevent future harm to Germans.

Valkyrie might have been better as a 'Made for TV' special. Instead of spending all that money about a minor footnote in the history of the Third Reich, wouldn't it have been better to focus on the complicity of the overwhelming majority of the German people who either enthusiastically embraced Hitler or looked the other way as he successfully carried out his nefarious plan of genocide and attempt at world domination?",1236988800,8,2798,5.234375
3676153,1,B001KZIRKY,"Think along the lines of point and realism...

What is the point of watching a PG-13 movie about Nazi's from the Nazi point of view about the plot to kill Hitler.
How can someone seriously make a film about Nazi's, and expect it to be realistic, and still get a PG-13 rating. I also found myself lost as to why the Nazi's had various accents from across the world, but none sounded like they were German...
AND, the writing on certain forms (not all forms) was German, yet nobody spoke German.

Plus, everybody already knew (if they paid attention in history class) that Hitler committed suicide. So why waste your time watching a film about something that you know is not going to work in the first place, only to pull for a Nazi posing as a good guy, and all under a family friendly rating?

1. Col. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) returns from battle in Tunisia missing an eye, a hand and a couple of fingers.
2. Not being a man to let such trivialities stand in his way, he's soon back in uniform, with the addition of a dashing eye patch and a glass eye in a little carrying case.
3. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) tries a little sleight of wine trick, but this proves to be yet another little hiccup in the plan to dispose of Hitler.
4. Von Stauffenberg is soon recruited to join the plot to free Germany from Hitler, his co-conspirators including  General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Colonel General Ludwig Beck (Terrence Stamp), Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, and retired Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben
5. Colonel von Quirnheim provides the know-how to make things go ""bang""
6. Col. Von Stauffenberg comes up with the Valkyrie plan, and convinces the group to go along with it.
7. He's soon very busy keeping an eye on the prize and a finger on the problem.
8. He wasn't around when things went off.
9. Ooops!

Excellent casting, costumes and filmography make this real life historical thriller come alive, and although things didn't quite pan out as planned, the desired result was achieved some nine months later.

Recommended for espionage and war buffs, and people who like to see Tom Cruise in serious movies.

3676155,4,B001KZIRKY,"""Valkyre"" is based on the incidents leading up to and following the famous July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and end the European theater of World War II. Tom Cruise portrays Claus von Stauffenberg, the leader and chief instigator of the plot, which involved killing Hitler with a bomb at the Wolf's Lair, a fortified bunker where Hitler would be meeting with many of his top generals. Von Stauffenberg was a decorated soldier who's lost an arm, an eye, and several fingers in North Africa.

There has been lots of controversy involving this film, much of it involving Cruise and the lack of German accents in the film. In the end, films are often made without respect to native languages and accents. That should be an issue here. Cruise is more than capable of playing von Stauffenberg as a dedicated, motivated soldier who for a number of reasons decides to join the conspriracy against Hitler. He is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and others.

The film, as with any Hollywood production, takes liberties with the truth. The aftermath of the bomb attempt is not accurate, and the involvement of Wilkinson's character in the plot is different than most historical accounts. But this is to be expected. More importantly, Valkyrie is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.",1236470400,2,1387,5.078947368421052

3676157,5,B001KZIRKY,"Having recently been invited to a private screening of the film in Los Angeles, I thought I would step forward and offer a few thoughts about the latest Cruise historical drama that tries to recreate and encapsulate the WWII acclaimed German Hero: Claus Count Schenk von Stauffenberg.

I'm not a WWII historian, but I have been reading the history deftly for the bulk of my life and I'm fairly well versed in the facts that build the story of the film. I've taken the liberty to list a few of the numerous books that well-detail this account at the bottom of the review in case folks want to read up first. These are my suggestions of the books that I've read, but I'm sure there are some that others will say are better.

First, Tom Cruise seems to have set a strong stride in film this year delivering up a very watchable performance in Tropic Thunder that is already garnering nominations. Second, this film could quite possibly be the high-water mark of his entire career, if it can survive the usual bevy of hard-core anti-Cruise critics that typically pop out of the woodwork every time one of his films is about to hit the theatres. Cruise has recently stated that many times people have told him that the films he has often selected to star in, would be career suicide, but by his own admission he's still going strong and has no desire to duck out now.

The factual nature of this Valkyrie production, and there definitely have been others, is probably what will pull people in and keep people locked in their seats. Valkyrie has an absolute eerie feel to it that is just downright creepy, but mesmerizing all at once. The reason is probably due to the fact that the film was shot on location throughout Germany and virtually no expense was spared from the sets, the vehicles, the `red banners and flags' that adorn so many scenes that chills and a cold sweat may form on the back of your neck.

I'm not going to include spoilers about the story and plot of the film, even though the story is already well known, but Tom Cruise does a very good job at portraying a historical figure who was known for his deep sense of commitment, spiritualism and honor. Some criticism has already been lobbed like a grenade at Cruise, stating that because he is a Scientologist, that he cannot possibly convey the depth of Stauffenberg ... which is just some sad, sad nonsense. I'm no fan of Scientology and I'm only a luke-warm viewer, or rather participant to Tom Cruise, but if the man ever came across on screen as an actor in a film, rather than a self-obsessed personality, then this is the vehicle. I was completely convinced at what I was seeing and knowing that the bulk, probably greater than 95%, of what I was seeing was true.

The only fault I could find in this film was the actor playing Adolf Hitler. I guess I was hoping, or rather looking for a performance as disturbing as the one given recently by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruno-Ganz/dp/B00005JKI7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruno Ganz</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-Untergang/dp/B0009RCPUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der Untergang</a>&nbsp;(or The Downfall for the rest of us). Bruno Ganz is one of those rare actors that only come along once in a generation and who rarely seem to show up in enough vehicles to satisfy a viewer's curiosity. But this really wasn't about Hitler as much as it was about Stauffenberg.

I also was a little taken aback by the lack of Tom Cruise's German accent, which is a very minor thing, but one would've thought that trying to engage in such a `larger than life' character, something would've surfaced from him as an attempt to self-authenticate his role as a German Army Officer and a member of the fallen Aristocracy that part and parcel clearly became duped by the momentum that Adolf cranked forward like self-powered locomotive that would obviously, inevitably, and thankfully de-rail.

At several points during this film, I could hear Mario Savio's immortal words repeating in my head:

""There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!""

Forget all the negative hype surrounding Valkyrie, because I assure you it is false. Bryan Singer has made a well-crafted thriller that kept me and my family on the edge of our seats until the end - even though we all know what the story's unfortunate outcome. Also, many tabloids were making this out to be the movie that would permanently cripple the career of Tom Cruise. This is entirely false. Cruise delivers a fine performance, and this hatred I can only assume is related to his rather odd personal life. Tom Cruise is as strong of an actor as he ever was, and I won't let something like turning Oprah's couch into a playground deny the fact that the man has talent, and is a truly passionate actor (and seriously, he does have a slight resemblance to Stauffenberg).

The movie is based on the last of fifteen known attempts on the life of German dictator Adolf Hitler (I'm sure everyone will have him in a nice ""Five Most Evil People"" list), and has Tom Cruise playing Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who of course was the key player in the assassination attempt. Ultimately this attempt failed (as we all know Hitler would die by suicide nine months later), but that doesn't keep Valkyrie from being an addictively engaging film.

Every member of the cast does their part well, not jockeying for superiority in any way. More importantly Cruise does not grandstand in this movie, fading in with the rest of the cast, rather than trying to stand above them like you'd expect, given his past films. Cruise gives a performance similar to 2005's War of the Worlds, where he does a good performance, but he never tries to overpower the other members of the cast. In Valkyrie Tom Cruise is a being a good team player, not trying to steal any glory, and never once does he overact the part.

Using very little CGI Valkyrie is also a wonderful film to look at. The vintage automobiles and aircrafts make this film have a distinct authentic flair that few other war films have (CGI looks like it was only used for the climatic assassination attempt). You can look at this and tell that this is the real deal, with the production team putting careful care into how they want this film to look, unlike most Blockbuster films that try and inflate every aspect of the film rather than aim for reality. Like the performance by Tom Cruise they don't try and overpower the audience with special effects, they simply let the characters slip into the realistic settings.

Also, the complaints about the accents I truly feel are desperate attempts to bash Cruise's performance. It was director Bryan Singer's concept to not use false German accents, and not that of Cruise, or the primarily British cast. I agree with Singer's concept that if feels false, and inaccurate to have people speak in English, but with foreign accents. I know several Germans in real life, and they do not sound very ""German"" when they speak in English, because the accent is not intended for the English language. I personally feel the desire for English being spoken in German accents comes from decades of WWII films where we've categorized every-single member of the German army, and by them speaking in that accent only is to clich them and separate them from American audiences. They can speak in German accents, but only if they're speaking in German, because if they aren't it seems to be a tool to keep your common American moviegoer from relating to the characters.

Don't go into Valkyrie expecting to be greeted with a horrifically bad film that you will be able to poke fun at with friends. The movie has been released, and I feel the rumors, and negative hype of been proven decisively false. This isn't a movie to kill Cruise's career, but it won't help him regain love in the American community either (as previously mentioned he doesn't shine so much as mix in with the rest of the cast). It is a very enjoyable dramatization of a true event, and I don't think the material could have been handled much better, even with a full German cast, because Singer's style and method of conveying this story are all very well-done.

Go out and enjoy this dramatization of one of the darkest periods of human history. It is worth every second of your time, and all though it isn't Oscar-worthy it is certainly worth two-hours of your time.",1236124800,289,4325,4.667979002624672
3676160,5,B001KZIRKY,"We all know who Hitler is. If you don't, you're an idiot. If you don't, let me give you a very short and vague lesson as to the man that is Hitler. Hitler = very evil man, killed many people, tried to create a German empire and almost succeeded, became a bit too power hungry and had his allies turn against him. Now you know Hitler, then this can lead you on the path to understanding this film and just exactly what operation Valkyrie was.

Operation Valkyrie is an operation put in place by Hitler which ensures that in the event of allied bombings on major German cities that may cause disruption to law & order and the upper authorities, that order and law is upheld. This is the basic ways in which operation Valkyrie would work and the movie tells the story of how Colonel Claus von Staufenberg (Cruise) and other major figures in Hitler's army attempt to use operation Valkyrie to their advantage to help the takeover of Hitler's government after he's assassinated.

Of course, many people can be forgiven for thinking that Hitler's Germany was all on his side. After all, that's the way it is portrayed in our school history lessons. Very rarely are we shown the good side of Germany, and very rarely are we taught about the numerous attempts on the Fuhrer's life. ""Valkyrie"" brings one of the more infamous attempts on Hitler's life to the big screen, which develops into one of the most thrilling movies of the year.

The film itself starts off with an attempt on Hitler's life as Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) hides a bomb within a wine case which is brought onto the same plane as Hitler as he leaves the airfield. The Bomb doesn't detonate and Tresckow is approached by fellow conspirator General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) who informs Tresckow that another member of their secret committee was arrested and therefore must be replaced. A recommendation is made that General Claus von Staufenberg (Cruise) should be brought in to help develop a new plan of action.

Throughout the film there is some fantastic dialogue which ignites genuine discussion over the nature of the German people during war time. Were all Germans 100% behind Hitler or were they simply taken intimidated by his prowess and posture? From the appearance of this film it would seem that some of his highest ranking generals weren't even an ounce behind him. It's not only the historical depiction that is great about this film but it's more about the way it's filmed and the appearance of the cast. The settings seem authentic and in some senses present an intimidating portrait of the Nazi's we have come to know about today.

Although this film is based around the plot to kill Hitler and restore Germany's dignity before they are invaded by the allies, we see very little of Hitler himself, played by David Bamber. The depiction of the Fuhrer is that of a frail, beaten old man who says very little. This is in high contrast to the electrifying and terrifying speeches we have seen him perform before his followers. Maybe the brief sightings of Hitler allow for the terrifying image we hold to stay within, whilst presenting this brief glimpse to remind us that ""this is the man who must die.""

It's a brilliantly shot, brilliantly acted and brilliantly paced film. Tom Cruise is astonishing as always and I think the many criticisms that I have heard about this film are highly unjust.",1235865600,6,3403,4.739864864864865
8316633,5,B001KZIRKY,"I don't care for Tom Cruise, but I thought he was brilliant in this.  Project Valkyrie was one of the plots used to try to assassinate Hitler - I think the last one.  I caught myself watching it every time it was on cable, so finally bought my own dvd.  Very well done scenery and set wise, the cast is great and the script is excellent.  I saw a real good film biography of the real guy that Cruise is playing in this, and the movie is quite historically accurate.  The actor who played Hitler did it so well  - it took place around D-Day, and he was crazed (not screaming-crazed) and shaky, as we've learned he was in the last part of the war.  In one part, a high Nazi official is swimming in a big pool that has a huge swastika painted on the bottom.",1527120000,,754,4.08843537414966
