7070696,4,B00USBLXL6,Underrated. Could have been a better overall movie without the overacting.,1433721600,,74,5.818181818181818
7070697,4,B00USBLXL6,"Is it the best movie I've ever seen? No.  But as far as golf movies go, its pretty good.  There are some really bad golf movies, at least this one has real golf shots.  Yes the storyline is a lil' predictable, but with good bad guys and good cinematography, I have no qualms about the six bucks I spent to watch it.",1433376000,,315,4.048387096774194
7070698,4,B00USBLXL6,"I liked it, it was compelling and a good story.
Loved the gambling on the course scenes, they were fun to watch. Cool that it was based on true life experiences and ended on a positive note",1432857600,,189,4.135135135135135
7070699,1,B00USBLXL6,"The movie was stupid with all this christian innuendo . The script and idea of the movie was one of those movies were you sat I yourself, are you serious, who would make this piece of garbage.",1432425600,,192,4.216216216216216
7070700,2,B00USBLXL6,An okay film. Predictable dialogue and plot.,1431820800,2,44,5.428571428571429
7070701,4,B00USBLXL6,"""You win your dead, you lose your dead. How's it feel to be caught in the squeeze?"" Augie (Sumpter) is a local kid who has a passion and talent for golf. After winning a local tournament he is approached by a man named Riverboat (McDonald) with a life changing offer. What starts off as a fun and easy way to make money changes when he becomes involved in a bet where there is no way out. This is a movie that I thought could go either way, really good or slow and boring. Luckily it was the former. I really enjoyed this and have to say that the golfing was incredible. The actors, for the most part, did all the golfing themselves which really helped the believe-ability of what was happening. The movie really hugged the line of a gambling movie that has been done over and over and trying to remain new and fresh, for the most part it pulled it off. This movie will not win any awards but I really enjoyed this and it is the type of movie you can watch a few times. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable with enough new ideas to make it seem fresh. I give this a high B.",1430784000,4,1072,4.183574879227053
7070702,5,B00USBLXL6,This is a fun little film with a moral ending. Jeremy Sumpter is so attractive and a good actor. You really want to root him on!,1430438400,2,128,3.9615384615384617
7070703,2,B00USBLXL6,"Yet another golf movie that is cheesy and cookie-cutter. Shooter is in it, though, which garnered an extra star...",1430265600,,114,5.052631578947368
7070704,4,B00USBLXL6,"The film claims to be based on a number of true stories involving Keith Flatt, a native Texan. In this film Augie (Jeremy Sumpter) is a high school champion golfer. He is discovered by a hustler named ""River Boat"" (Christopher McDonald) who uses Augie as a golf ringer to make money, of which Augie gets a decent cut. Augie's girlfriend (Jillian Murray) disapproves of the relationship. Augie's family needs the money as Dad (Elliott Grey) is not pulling his weight and is abusive.

The film is a fun easy going drama. At one point they are playing the theme from movie ""Sting."" A decent film for a family night with teens.

Guide: No F-bombs. No nudity. People undressing for sex, brief body grinding.",1429920000,5,702,4.699186991869919

7070746,3,B00USBLXL6,I was thinking this would be like a made-for-TV Tin Cup movie.  It's not.  Pro tip; TIn Cup and Caddy Shack are cheaper to rent and more entertaining.  Hell I'd watch Caddy Shack 2 before I'd watch this movie.,1461888000,,209,4.3076923076923075

7070767,1,B00USBLXL6,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The fact that I golf only compounds how bad this movie is. Don't watch it, don't waste your time, it's really that bad",1446249600,,168,3.9705882352941178
7070768,1,B00USBLXL6,"I play golf. I also eat, sleep, and breathe from time to time. That being said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I stopped watching around the middle. Sports movies, and golf movies in particular, are tough to nail down. You don't want to focus too much on the game because then it just looks like golf porn. Also, good cinematography during the playing portions of the movie are the only highlight of what is otherwise just a faith-based (Christian) morality tale of a deal with the devil. Stick to ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" (which has the best competitive golf montage of any golf movie) and Tin Cup (a totally harmless, albeit cheesy, golf themed rom-com) or even Happy Gilmore and Caddyshack if you want your golf fix because you won't get it here, unless you're one of those people that doesn't mind the illogic of ""the girlfriend/star golfer/caddie/prayer partner arguing against her boyfriend playing golf for money and then holding his bag in the very next scene"" just because the movie espouses the virtues of Christ.",1446249600,3,1049,4.737704918032787
