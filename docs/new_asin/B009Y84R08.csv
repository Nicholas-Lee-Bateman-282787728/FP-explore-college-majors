8545193,5,B009Y84R08,"This two hour DVD leads off with an excellent 25 minute documentary about the forming of ALCO from a scattering of smaller locomotive companies, the companies growth, decline, merger, and demise. I love the segment with an actual ALCO AUTOMOBILE, one of only a handful of survivors. There are even words from the mechanic. This detailed documentary takes us into the plant for WWII army tank construction, then we see the transition to diesels. There is a roughly one hour collection of ALCO diesels on large and small railroads in the US and Canada, finishing with a ""star"" steam locomotive or two. Bonus features alone are worth the special amazon price. There are plenty of ALCO steam DVDs, I was glad to learn more about the company and its other products. Famous photographer, author Jim Shaughnessy is interviewed as icing on the cake.",1404259200,,841,4.888111888111888
8545194,3,B009Y84R08,About 95 percent diesel and 5 percent steam.  Not what I was hoping for.  Other than yard switchers ALCO made very few successful diesel engines.  I was hoping for a history of big steam.  My fault for hoping I guess.  What is available out there on steam seems to be mainly the rebuilds used on tourist train rides.  Sort of like dinosaurs at Jurassic park.  They should take a look at When Giants Roamed.,1404086400,,406,4.405405405405405
