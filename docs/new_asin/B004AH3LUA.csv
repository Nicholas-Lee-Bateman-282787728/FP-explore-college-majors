8420239,5,B004AH3LUA,"I love this show. This is a Winx Club spinoff that is PopPixie, as seen on Winx Club Season 2 onwards. PopPixie: Season 1 Vol. 1 ""The Magical Flute"" contains the first 13 short episodes French dubbed.

The PAL 50Hz quality footage looks fine, however the episodes to me is all that matters despite the original Italian version still isn't available on PAL Region 2 yet. Oh by the way, just a reminder to always read the product description every time you come across a DVD released overseas... otherwise you'll have to do some Google research afterwards!",1448064000,,554,4.711340206185567
