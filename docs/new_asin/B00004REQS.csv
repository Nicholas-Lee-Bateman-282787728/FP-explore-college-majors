The footage is so fascinating and the video accurately explains the life cyle of the hive and its queen, the mating process, the duties within the hive, survival against predators, and social aspects of the hive.  I am an insect fan and I LOVE this video.  Even my three year old likes the video.  She may not understand it but seems to like watching it.  I would recommend this for 6th grade and up as part of a science course.....If you are just a BEE - FAN - then this is the video you MUST have!",989971200,5,623,4.245762711864407
7920858,5,B00004REQS,"This video features some of the most incredible close-up photography ever shot. FLY on the back of a bee as it harvests nectar and pollen... CRAWL through the hive as the queen lays thousands of eggs each day... You'll be  treated to watching bees measure, using their bodies, for new hive  construction, and seeing them as they swarm to look for a new home. See how  they interact with their human keepers, and how they protect their home  from marauding neighbors. You will never look at bees again the same way  after watching this video - it is stunning, informative, entertaining AND  educational.",957398400,7,602,4.796116504854369
