The story seems to do a right angle half way through and then goes nowhere. Not much naughty bits to write home to mother about either. Save your money and use your imagination.

1910391,4,B0000C2ITQ,"This movie is sort of a sequel to the Butterscotch graphic novels by Milo Manara.  An aspiring actor finds an invisibility formula in a home where he is hired as a waiter.  Clumsy fingers result in him being covered in the formula and becoming invisible.
Having been dumped by one girl earlier in the day, he finds himself being thrown together with a new girl right away (another actress).  Little does he know that someone else has discovered the formula and become invisible.
The story starts in LA btu then moves to London and finally Italy.  Sex, ghosts, auditions, and a meeting of the invisible men fill out the story.
 (...) Many are viewed through scenery such as cobwebs and wine racks.  The wine cellar is interesting as it starts in LA and winds up in Italy.  But despite all the naked flesh this is really a comedy and fails in its attempt at an erotic atmosphere.  Sure, some will find the volume of flesh erotic but not all.",1080086400,70,939,4.514792899408284
7998183,2,B0000C2ITQ,I didn't think that a movie like this would have rated or unrated versions. I've seen a few scenes online and they were uncut and unrated. This copy was edited and somewhat censored. I wished that it had specified which it was.,1493510400,,227,4.428571428571429

7998185,4,B0000C2ITQ,"It should be said that this show has sex tidbits rather than sex scenes.  It would have been much better without the objects and people interspersed throughout every erotic escapade.
  Still, I bought it and love the sexual tension that comes with being invisibly aroused while no one can see you in the same room.  However they should have just dropped more of the silly storyline, made the sex hardcore, and even add a few more, then at least they would have been able to make a real good film worth repetitive watching.
But hey, we can't have everything we want, and the ladies were hot.  The exquisite & erotic Kim Dawson has one scene as a fortune teller that I love watching over and over but other than that, you know.  So-so.  But with Kim's breasts in it, 4 stars!",1269216000,3,773,4.439716312056738
7998186,3,B0000C2ITQ,"This review is from;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Erotic-Misadventures-of-the-Invisible-Man-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0000C2ITQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man (Unrated Edition)</a>

What initially appeared to be another lousy movie with a bad script for actors and actresses with uninspiring performances strangly kept my eyes fixated to the screen. Sure it's just another soft-core film with a nude scene every 5 minutes, but the silliness mixed with the erotic nudity kept my attention.

In a nut shell this movie follows the adventures of a struggling actor, Norman (played by Scott Coppala) who stumbles upon a invisible solution by accident in Los Angeles. On the same day he loses his girlfriend, job and the sight of his body due to his invisibility. All is not lost as he instantly hooks up with the very beautiful Kelly (played by the very, sexy Gabrielle Hall who is featured on the DVD's cover). Kelly is also another stuggling actress. Norman falls for Kelly instantly and she accepts his invisibility because he satisfies her sexually even though she cannot see him.

Kelly has a silly, physic roomate that convinces Kelly to go to Europe with her to investigate a ghost disturbance. Her roomate has plenty of chocolates that are sexual aphrodisiacs that instigates a few sexual frenzies on some unsuspecting victims. Norman goes to Europe with Kelly as well as Kelly's scheming agent who also finds the invisible formula and uses it. With plenty of sex scenes along the way, the finale is a short showdown between the two invisible men fighting for Kelly.

Gabrielle Hall is stunningly beautiful and some of the other women are not bad either (and some are not so good also!). The movie moves at a pretty quick pace and nude scenes seem to come every five minutes. Special effects for the novelty invisible sequences are limited to seeing women's skirts/clothes ripped off, womens' breasts being gently touched and a few stationary objects or people getting moved. Not high tech effects, but expected for the budget of this film. When there is sex between the invisible man & woman the effects are limited to the woman embracing air with her outstretched arms and getting into various sexual positions alone. There is full, frontal nudity in addition to the numerous topless scenes for the women. There is even a gratutious lesbian scene by two, unsuspecting women instigated by the antics by an invisible man. Typical, soft, core stuff.

The DVD itself is full screen with scene selection. Special features are limited to text notes on Gabrielle Hall, Scott Copola and Kim Dawson. There are trailers for the feature film as well as other films (all by New Concorde) called ""Firefight"" (about a money robber heist in a forest fire), ""Hot Parts"" (about some black ladies that steal cars in a theft ring) and ""Sex, Lies and Politics"" (about a lobbyist guy who uses women to gain favor with politicians).

Overall a decent DVD release for my collection that I'm happy to keep. Sure it's just another soft core flick, but the invisible-man story line merits some interest. The movie has many silly moments, but enough nudity to keep satisfaction and balance to this rare combination of comedy/eroticism.",1209081600,6,3299,5.226843100189036
7998187,1,B0000C2ITQ,"You're looking at buying this for one of two reasons, don't bother.  It's not funny, not even stupid funny, and there is nothing erotic about this movie unless you like 30-40 year old people with sagging skin pretending to get it on.  If you want funny/erotic movies check out Misty Mundae, at least theres some decent content there.",1155600000,9,333,4.724137931034483
7998188,4,B0000C2ITQ,"Think about it,running around totally unseen doing mischief, of course i would use my invisibility to do good things-(chuckling in the background)-ok fine, don't believe me! Anyway, i love the fact this movie has the lovely Gabriella Hall and Jacqueline Lovell. I just wish they would import more of the original Butterscotch movies to the U.S. and put the story closer the Milo Manara books. This movie also features pornstars Holly Hollywood and Rebecca Lord, in one clip the invisible man lifts up Holly's skirt to reveal she is wearing no underwear and displaying a backside that would make J-Lo jealous! the two women engage in a lesbian scene which our invisible fellow decides to join in on. I think they should have more scenes where he was lifting up skirts and pulling off clothes, I only saw 2 in the movie and let's be honest,that's the kind of stuff you like to see in an invisible man movie.",1145404800,20,905,4.69811320754717
7998189,3,B0000C2ITQ,"This is a soft-core movie.  There are some amazing beautiful women in this movie.  The story looks okay for me, but the actors look not professional and act not naturally.  The director could make it more professional and entertaining.",1126396800,5,235,4.9743589743589745
7998190,1,B0000C2ITQ,"This movie didn't come close to the standards set by Porky's or numerous other 70s and 80s -vintage skin flicks that became popular. The women were okay looking, but there was not a hint of the situational circumstances that cause nudity to be arousing, as occured in Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, or Harold and Kumar go to White Castle; any teenager could come up with a better story. If you are in it only for the nudity, you could do as well or better just about anywhere.",1123632000,9,476,4.420454545454546
7998191,4,B0000C2ITQ,"Unrated adult ""comedy.""  According to IMDb.com, this 2003 film is an edited verison of the 1997 TV Series ""Butterscotch,"" though the TV series had a different director and writer (and mostly the same actors, but their character's names are spelled differently; and one movie actor actually played a different part in the tv series).

DVD features: This DVD contains the unrated film, a Special Features section and a Preview Attractions section.  The Special Features include three cast biographies (Kim Dawson, Scott Coppola, & Gabriella Hall) and the movie trailer.  The Preview Attractions includes trailers for ""Firefight"" (Stephen Baldwin), ""Hot Parts"" (Kenya Moore, Sticky Fingaz, Tami Anderson, Jessica Lugo) and ""Sex, Lies & Politics"" (Doug Merrill).

Stars/credits: The movie stars Scott Coppola (Norman Parent, the invisible man), Gabriella Hall (Kelli Parkinson; ""Clean Slate,"" ""LA Confidential,"" ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs,"" ""Shadow Dancer""; and the woman on the cover and back of the DVD; also known as Laura Saldivar), Craig Peck (Paul; ""There's Nothing Out There""), Doug Merrill (Robert Bull), Stacey Leigh Mobley (Becky Lovey; also known as Holly Hollywood), and Kim Dawson (Linda or Madam Nirvana; ""seen in over fifty films"").  The movie was written and directed by Rolfe Kanefsky (""There's Nothing Out There"").  The credits mention that this movie is ""Based on the comic books of Milo Manara,"" and while it is not specifically mentioned, I believe this is based on two or more ""Butterscotch"" books.

Plot Summary: Norman Parent is a struggling actor who has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has found someone else.  To pick up extra cash, in other words to pay the bills, Norman works as a waiter at private parties.  While working as a waiter, Norman is told to get some wine from the wine cellar.  He finds two people that have slipped off from the party for some action, and he fantasies that the man and woman are his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend (a somewhat reoccurring theme).  He dodges past them to a small room where he runs into Kelli Parkinson, another struggling actor.  Before too much time passes, Norman's boss sticks his head in the room and fires Norman.  Kelli leaves, and Norman knocks over a large container of some liquid substance.  Well, that liquid substance gets all over Norman, and he turns invisible and acquires the scent of butterscotch.  The rest of the movie involves Norman wandering around invisible getting into mischief, mostly with Kelli, and having fantasies about his ex-girlfriend, including an erotic Olympic competition.  This includes: Norman getting back at his ex-boss at the party by making him look like a fool, and playing with the guests and the female waitress (by ripping her dress off, which inspires one female guest to take her dress off - who is attractive and quite happy, but not an actress); fun with Kelli at her friends apartment when Kelli accidentally eats the wrong food that makes her very aroused;  fun in Europe/England: joining in on a sance; Italy: joining Kelli for a screen test, and ""helping"" a horror film actress ""act"" more believable in being aroused/erotically energized;  and other fine adventures.

Most of the mischief, though, involves a second invisible man, Kelli's agent Robert Bull, who appears to have gotten some of that invisible cream onto himself at the party.  Robert seems to have more fun as an invisible man than Norman.  Robert's activities include playing with two women that are visiting his office (actually, the two women have more fun with each other, with the invisible man ""helping""); following Kelli to Europe, and playing with some people in Europe, like a hotel reception desk attendant (pretending to be a ghost and ripping her clothes off); attacking Kelli at a restaurant, and being confused for Norman.

Review: The acting is actually better than you might expect for this type of film (at least Scott/Norman (before he turned invisible), Gabriella/Kelli and Norman's friend in the movie; I certainly believe they could do well in more mainstream material).  The plot is a little absurd, but also somewhat better than you might expect (though everyone's acceptance of an invisible Norman is a little strange).  Obviously some money was spent to make this film (though it appears that they reused some sets).  It did not look like a film that was just hurriedly made in someone's basement, or backyard.",1115251200,35,4443,5.085399449035813
