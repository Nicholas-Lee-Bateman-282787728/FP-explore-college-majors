7719160,3,B01DL93E68,"The storyline involves a love triangle that eventually works itself out. Charlie is a 20something year old Jewish, gay man who is in love with his best friend Sebastian and also in love with Tim, an older man in his 30s. Tim is a professional pianist while Sebastian is involved in a financial scandal. Charlie currently attends college and is an amazing artist. There are lots of wonderful scenes that it's hard for me to choose a few to focus on, but all the actors were amazing. They had great chemistry. It is about love, friendship, loss, growing up, and heartbreak. I'm looking forward to Joey Kuhn's next film!",1465862400,8,617,4.669724770642202
7719161,3,B01DL93E68,"An accurate portrayal of what it's like to be a 20 something in New York City, while navigating the complexities of love, friendship and career. The characters are frustratingly indecisive, and seemingly caught in an endless circle of poor choices and emotional torment, which I found highly annoying. However, this is a solid, warm and enjoyable film. The acting is above average and the characters are genuine, relatable and well thought out. One aspect that sets this film apart is its attempt to normalize homosexuality, instead of allowing it to become a character unto itself. It succeeds in doing so as Charlie, the main character, just happens to be gay without it being a focal point. Refreshingly, viewers won't find any clichd coming out stories, or drawn out angst. If you survived your 20's, this will most assuredly remind you of the decisions made that still haunt you into adulthood.",1464912000,20,899,5.0

If only Charlie weren t secretly in love with his own manipulative best friend, Sebastian (Jason Ralph), who thanks to his crooked father is in a financial scandal. Sebastian is very well known in the social circles of Manhattan so going out is problematic without getting the press involved. The group goes out to a piano bar where very sweet Charlie meets Tim for the first time. Sebastian really does love Charlie in the only and best way he can and that is more using Charlie's love to keep him near. I won't say too much more because there is so much going on in this movie and all of it is interesting and fascinating and great studies of human behavior....all across the board.

Comparable to 500 Days of Summer, the story takes place throughout an extended timeline. Two best friends since school are faced with turmoil in the private lives and how it affects their relation with each other and their friends. I will say, I understand why the ending was the way it was but for once I would have liked a happy ending, to show that where there's a will there's a way, and that things that are meant to work out will do so in the end.

7719186,1,B01DL93E68,"For any serious movie lover, Those People demands to be compared to Whit Stillman's brilliant 1990 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolitan/dp/B007USWCO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolitan</a>. Both movies are about a small, close group of late-adolescent rich kids on New York's Upper East Side; both cover a limited time period, offering a slice-of-life look into the isolated dream world the kids live in; and both were written and directed by men who were born and raised inside that world.

The only superficial difference between the two movies is that Metropolitan has no overtly gay characters. But below the surface the differences are profound, and in every way Metropolitan proves itself the better movie, by far. The only good thing I can say about Those People is that it reawakened my interest in Metropolitan.

The most obvious of Metropolitan's strengths is its point of view. Its main character is a guy named Tom, who is NOT from that world, but gets caught up with them by accident while hailing the same taxi in front of the Plaza Hotel. We see the rich kids' world through his eyes, and it adds depth to both the movie and all of its characters, a depth completely lacking in Those People.

Those People has no similar Everyman character for the audience to identify with, so we see its world and the characters in it from the outside only, and it never feels real. Charlie, the main character in Those People, is an outsider only in being Jewish, which on the Upper East Side makes him not really an outsider at all. Although Charlie gets lots more screen time than Tom has in Metropolitan, he seems much less real, and the audience is left looking AT that world instead of seeing INSIDE it, which is Metropolitan's most astounding achievement.

Although I'm gay, I felt a lot more at home in Metropolitan, with no gay characters, than I did in Those People, in which gays predominate. That's because every character in Metropolitan is a human being, a complex mix of traits that somehow gets conveyed clearly in a very short time. I believed in and I cared about all of the characters in Metropolitan, without even trying to.

In Those People, we have The Gay Jewish Boy Who Doesn't Quite Fit In Even Though He's Rich And Very Cute, and The Languid, Spoiled, Self-Destructive Gay WASP Boy Who Is Everybody's Darling Even Though His Father Is A Crook, and The Exotic Middle-Eastern Gay Concert Pianist Who's Hot as Blazes Even Though He's A Foreigner And Over 30, and several other equally shallow stereotypes. It's very tiresome.

I'd lots rather spend a couple of hours with real straight people than with gay caricatures. Compounding the problem is that none of the gay characters is played by an actor gifted enough to be believable as gay. I'd rather have NO gay characters than characters played by painfully straight actors trying their hardest to act gay.

The fact that Joey Kuhn titled his movie Those People may indicate that he meant to keep the audience at a distance, outside looking in, but nothing else about the movie makes that seem intentional. I think we're supposed to CARE what happens to Charlie, Sebastian, Tim and company; I tried, but I just couldn't. Why would a director want to keep his audience at a distance anyway? I can't think of any good reason.

So if you're thinking about seeing Those People, do yourself a big favor and see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolitan/dp/B007USWCO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolitan</a>&nbsp;first. If then you still want to see Those People, by all means do it. I'll even give you my DVD.

One final but very important note. The most important difference between Metropolitan and Those People is this: Metropolitan is a drama and Those People is a melodrama. For anyone who isn't sure what THAT difference is, here's a quickie: A drama is a mostly serious story in which relatively normal things happen to people who behave pretty much like real people behave. A melodrama is an unrelentingly serious story in which extremely dramatic things happen constantly to people who overreact to everything. Watching a drama is like watching people living their lives. Watching a melodrama is like watching a reality TV program, where every moment is packed full of extreme conflict or crisis or both.

Those of you who have been raised on reality TVie, anyone born after about 1990, since The Real World gave birth to the genre in 1992will be MUCH more at home with Those People. Joey Kuhn's sensibilities and idea of what constitutes entertainment clearly were formed by that ""reality"". The relentless stream of extreme crisis and highly charged emotional conflict in Those People will seem real to you, and Metropolitan will bore you to death.",1476144000,,4840,5.092055485498109
7719187,5,B01DL93E68,A much better-than-usual low-budget gay movie. Jonathan Gordon is absolutely charming. He reminds me of Andrew Garfield. I'd love to see them play brothers in something.,1476057600,,169,5.538461538461538
7719188,5,B01DL93E68,"About twelve years ago, when I first started watching Logo and the Here network, high quality films with gay protagonists were pretty difficult to find.  Storylines tended to focus solely on LGBT characters as outsiders, rejected by their peers, their families and society at large.  It was nearly always either the coming out story or the AIDS story and pretty much nothing else.  All I wanted to see was a story where the protagonist's queer identity was somewhat incidental to the plot and all I got were more stories that were about nothing more than ""being gay."" And because of the stigma attached to portraying a gay character, ofentimes the acting was pretty lackluster with directors seeming to have to settle for the small pool of actors (gay or straight) who were willing to take the risk.

Well, a lot has changed since then and this film is an amazing example of that.

It's the story of Charlie Kinberg, a college senior majoring in fine art, and his fifteen year unrequited crush on his best friend, Sebastian Blackworth, son of an imprisoned Bernie Madoff-like hedge fund swindler.  The two childhood friends party with their small posse of well-heeled twenty-somethings (all struggling to make their mark on the Big Apple), mostly confined to Sebastian's luxurious apartment because he can never leave without being hounded by paparazzi.  Screenwriter and director Joey Kuhn has created a gorgeous synthesis from influences as disparate as Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters (the gorgeously saturated colors and almost painterly cinematography), Whit Stillman's Metrpolitan (the erudite banter of the attractive cast), Brideshead Revisited (the fallen, debauched scion, also named Sebastian) and The Great Gatsby (that years-long unrequited love set amongst New York's hoi polloi).

There was nothing about this film I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  It's beautiful to look at.  Plus (unlike the recent Ghostbusters re-boot) it was actually shot all over NYC and it has that great feel exclusive to New York films (like another one of my favorite NY indies - Tadpole).  The cast of mostly theatre actors is unanimously amazing, not to mention that they're extremely easy on the eyes (which doesn't hurt - particularly when a couple of hot sex scenes are involved) and the dialogue is intelligently written while still sounding organic and not forced.  Across the board, the acting is nuanced and believable.  The three leads are especially good - Jonathan Gordon, very much the young Tony Perkins, is very raw, sympathetic and vulnerable without passing over into melodrama, Haaz Sleiman is warm and appealing as Tim Malek (Charlies suave older love interest) and, as the tortured Sebastian, Jason Ralph is outstanding in a difficult, complex role.

I should warn any Magicians fan-girls who are looking to see a slashy Quentin Coldwater get his HEA on - this is not a love story.  It's definitely one character's journey to self-acceptance and maturity.  If you're willing to put romantic expectations aside, you're in for a real treat.",1475971200,6,3049,5.1417004048583

The three actors plays so well off one another especially the relationship with Sebastion in which seemed so real. You could love and dislike the guy at the same time.

This movie is a heartbreaking drama about love and friendship that pulls on the heartstrings.  One of the things that I think can safely be said about this story is that it hits home.  One of my favorite lines in this movie is ""We've all had a Sebastian.""

Charlie has been in love with his best friend Sebastian for many years, and although his feelings are pretty apparent, neither of them have ever talked about or acted on it.  Instead, Charlie ends up in this vicious cycle of being the doting supportive best friend, and putting himself and his own needs aside, while Sebastian uses and manipulates him into sticking around.

Sebastian grows increasingly reliant on Charlie to be there for him and help him through his depression while he's dealing with an illegal financial scandal Sebastian's father was involved in.  When Charlie meets an older pianist, Tim, who is crazy for him, it's the first time Charlie has put someone else first, and Sebastian gets very jealous and gives Charlie a guilt trip when he starts to spend a lot of time with the new man in his life.

Things come to a head when Charlie finally is able to confront Sebastian about his feelings, and it is clear to see that even if Sebastian did love him back in the same way, that Sebastian isn't emotionally stable enough or capable of being able to give Charlie what he needs and wants, as much as he may want to.  When Charlie is able to break away from his friend and branch out on his own, it teaches him a lot about himself and makes him realize the value in being in a relationship with someone that is mutual, and begins his task of learning to let go.

Something that I really like about this movie, is that it is absent of the typical topics that are present in LBGT movies.  These characters are not closeted homosexuals or ashamed about who they are, or struggling with who they are.  The movie doesn't focus on the fact that they are gay.  These are just normal friendships and relationships where the characters happen to be gay.

The film is really about loyalty, trust, friendship, love ,and seeing it through thick and thin in an environment that can be daunting. (The city of New York.) All the actors seem well cast, and what they may lack in life experience (in their roles), they more than make us in grit and ability to see things through in their lives.

For many people, living in a big city brings to the forefront, confronting many life issues that can more slowly percolate in little town for a long time. The film sees growth in many of the characters and, the love stories are well presented. I especially liked the reference to the Jewish High Holy Days, and the custom of Tashlich, the metaphorically discarding of one's past sins to move on to a new year, afresh.

7719219,2,B01DL93E68,"The best thing about this movie was the trailer.  The movie itself was a disappointment.  While the production values were very good and the acting was adequate, the character development and direction lacked focus and dramatic tension.  Because most of the customer reviews were so good, I stuck with the film till the end, but found myself fast forwarding at times out of sheer boredom.  I was hoping for some kind of catharsis or emotional pay off  which never came.  The supporting characters were not adequately drawn, and there was an overemphasis on the main character's Jewishness while his love interest's Lebanese origin was only casually mentioned.  I really wanted to like this film - judging  from most of  the reviews and from the trailer it had a lot to offer.  Sadly it failed to deliver, and the blame would have to go to both the writing and the direction.",1470960000,3,874,4.766666666666667

Joey Kuhn has gifted the world with a cinematic masterpiece; a modern tale illustrated with a nostalgic flare. Watching this movie was an experience I can only liken to reading a book that has changed my perception of friendship, loyalty, and love -- and was brought to life by incredible talent. Kuhn's filmmaking skill was not wasted on leads Jonathan Gordon and Jason Ralph. Each of the actors brought soul and heartbreak into their characters, and have both made a fan out of me. This film is filled with story, performances, and scenery you do not want to miss. I am absolutely in love.",1469923200,8,664,4.588235294117647

7719228,4,B01DL93E68,"Just finished watching ""Those People"" released by Wolfe Video.
People often cause complications that lead to their own unhappiness and cause them not willing to take the risk leaving the settled established routine for the shaky foundations of love and an undefined future.
Charlie is a 20-something art student who is putting together his thesis in portrait painting, who has been in love and pinning away for his selfish and conflicted best friend Sebastian, who doesn't see Charlie as a life partner, but more of a convenient crutch.
In perhaps one of the most painful scenes in ""Those People,"" Charlie is willing to degrade himself in a desperate, if not rather pathetic attempt to show Sebastian just how much he loves him.  Doesn't work.
Part of Sebastian's problem is that he's a trust fund baby who has been reduced to an agoraphobic state due to the relentless pursuit of the press hounding him for his father's financial misgivings.
Charlie's problem is that he has found love with Tim - an older concert pianist who is pursuing his own dreams of a career on the orchestral stage; but Charlie wants the illusion of safety in trying to keep things the same.
""Those People"" encompasses the moment in people's lives when they realize that they have to move on and stand on their own.  Without giving too much away, Charlie does eventually have that self-actualization when he's finally able to paint his own portrait.
Strongly Recommended!

7719242,4,B01DL93E68,"Very rich storytelling here from writer and director Joey Kuhn (taut, spare script) and some very good performances from Jonathan Gordon, Haaz Sleiman and Jason Ralph. It's about family, friendship, loyalty, and love and what these values mean when truly horrific and wonderful challenges--unexpected and unsolicited--test your commitment and understanding of them and to them. Either you grow-up or give-up. The photography is wonderful, evoking the mood and feel of a Whitney (""Whit"") Stillman film (think Metropolitan) or even a New York based Woody Allen film (Hannah and her Sisters, et al)--you know, that Autumn in New York feel. It is cozy, warm and the perfect backdrop for this really intimate film. There are so many intimate moments between mother and son, father and son, lovers and among friends. All well-scripted and well-acted...except for the very last scene. Surely, a closing or ending of some sort is needed and though the scripted scene is not without reference,  it was flat, stagey and did not seem right. What we need to know could have been achieved with pictures, I think.",1466985600,15,1099,5.139664804469274

But i saw a couple of clips and put my Polly Progressive political analysis back on the shelf where it belongs. Joey Kuhn has written an incredibly subtle, nuanced script about friendship and the ways it often differs between straight and gay, the gut-wrenching break that occurs when ""those people"" the ones you thought would always be there stay stuck when you begin moving. There is one performance, that of Charlie's mother, who tells him to grow up because ""real men say good-bye"" which is reminiscent of Beatrice Straight in ""Network"" - maybe 5 minutes of screen time but, like Straight, Oscar quality acting.",1526774400,,756,4.778625954198473
