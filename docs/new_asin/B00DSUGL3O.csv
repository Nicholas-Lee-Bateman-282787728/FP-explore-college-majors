5853880,5,B00DSUGL3O,Great shipping and price!  The movie was not a total bias approach to filmmaking.  It's very comprehensive information about the situation American is in and the director also goes way out of the way by following a very young man who is here illegally and shows us life and mindsets from their vantage point. Highly recommend this to you.,1391731200,10,338,4.711864406779661

5853888,5,B00DSUGL3O,"Definitely a must see. He interviews people on both sides of the immigration issue. I'm amazed at his commitment to provide the truth for everyone to see, even at risk to himself and using his own funds to obtain information from everyday people. He is even able to get protestors to talk to him and to first listen to what he is saying before they decide to smear his name or disrupt his informational meetings.

5853891,5,B00DSUGL3O,"The illegal immigration situation and danger at the border are given the most intimate treatment imaginable.  The first one is made more persuasive by the fact that Dennis Lynch is apolitical about it, just exploring the arguments for and against illegal immigration, investigating the border himself, and disclosing his personal relationship with an illegal who eventually disappeared out of his life.  The second one is perhaps more angering because of its findings about how Obama has deliberately let the situation get even worse, based on wanting more Democrat voters and a false sense of justice, that just because illegals want a better life means we should have no border control.  The most angering parts to me in the second one are when Obama mocked people who want more border security as wanting a moat with alligators, and also how he and other politicians who are willing to commit time and money to ""comprehensive immigration reform"" neglected the helpless victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Both documentaries together helped me come to the realization that politicians are pretty hardened about the safety needs of the people at the border.  EVERYBODY knows the southern border is not safe.  One thing he delves into in #2 is the national security danger of terrorism when the government keeps hampering efforts to secure the border.

These are my conclusions after watching these two documentaries:  1) It'd be infeasible and, more importantly, very inhumane to attempt to deport all illegal immigrants and their children who are now established in the United States.  The most important thing right now is to control the border and make sure only a certain number of immigrants come in per year.  Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, who is featured on at least one of the documentaries, says on a YouTube video that the sustainable level of immigration for Americans is about 250,000 a year, if we don't want the economic and crime-related problems that come from too much of an increase.  The Rodney King riots wouldn't have happened were it not for such massive immigration leading to racial unrest.  Why don't people talk about that in news commentary nowadays as the issue is even more severe?  2) E-Verify is a good way to make sure you're hiring workers who are legally here.  3) Sanctuary cities which deliberately condone illegal immigration need to be punished, as well as anchor baby hotels (which are designed to give people luxurious hotel stays so they can have their kids born in the US, get citizenship privileges, and then return to the native country).  4) If a politician is going to talk about an amnesty plan, reject what he/she is saying unless securing the borders comes first.  Amnesty for the illegal immigrants already in our country is inevitable, because there's no better solution, but you HAVE to have secure borders so this problem doesn't worsen.  5) Never listen to rhetoric which makes it sound like illegal immigrants have the ""right"" to be in America, because that is a deliberate distraction from the real issue, which is safety.  Criminal networks operate near the border, and that danger CONSTANTLY gets overlooked, quite intentionally, by people such as Obama, who make it sound like it's all about giving people the right to participate in America's democracy, to seek a better life.  It's just like Democrat objections about voter ID:  ""Somebody will be left out if we have voter ID laws.""  Well that's inevitable, and a socialist utopia of government making everyone have an equal chance tends to lead to massive corruption, and also tears down the incentive for working hard when the undeserving get better deals from the government than hard-working people.

Just days before I write this, Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, lost in the primary partly because of his push for amnesty.  I wish I could say with confidence that it's the beginning of a trend toward solutions to the illegal immigration issue.  I'm all for giving illegals--depending on whether they have criminal records, of course--a slow path to US citizenship, as long as we secure the borders and ensure that this influx doesn't continue.  But that's not what politicians mean when they say ""amnesty"":  they don't intend to secure the border.  One thing I appreciate about Dennis Lynch is that he is very clearly interested in learning how the immigration situation affects the American people.  #1 is the definitive documentary on the arguments for and against it, the border situation, and the motivations for illegals coming to America.  #2 is about the political shenanigans which are going on, and the danger of terrorist attacks.  Sadly, the Democrat policy under Obama has been to focus on gun regulation rather than border security or violent entertainment when attempting to prevent more violent crimes.

There is much food for thought in both documentaries.",1403481600,2,4896,5.059775840597759

Here's a bit of info on this great documentary I found elsewhere.

Dennis Michael Lynch has appeared on numerous national and local TV and radio programs.  He's built a reputation for being a passionate patriot who tells it like it is. He defends the American people at all costs but never loses respect for those with differing opinions.  In addition, he is a popular speaker who draws hundreds of people.
