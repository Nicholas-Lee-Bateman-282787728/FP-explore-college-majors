******************
Another update: The customer service came back to me, there was a confusion, it cost $750 or $500 extra, if I like to have English or Latin script. THEY DON'T OFFER IT!!!! Is that the industry standard the foreign language DVD comes with subtitle or script? If you don't know Latin, and like to learn, may not be a good choice. The story looks cute, you can guess it, but you don't understand it.
**********************
A little update: I contacted Phenix learning, they came back to me within a week, and they will follow up the subtitles.
**********************
When my child has a first Latin class, he just fell in love with it. So I bought this -- I guess the original is old and converted to DVD version. So quality is not good, barely ok, and I don't have a problem with it. It looks like a cute short story, but NO ENGLISH or LATIN SUBTITLE -  (Do I miss a hidden subtitle button else where?) The story is easy enough to guess even though you have no knowledge on Latin, but guessing the story has limit. I did research on internet, but nothing shows up.",1507420800,,1319,4.518828451882845
8296970,4,B001E6V508,"This movie had become a cult classic (a very small cult) in my high school Latin classes back in the 80s. When it was shown in Latin class students would show up with Rocky Horror Picture Show-type props - particularly carrots. I was a poor classical scholar, but I still know the Fra Iacobus song!",1471651200,,298,4.4363636363636365
