8577387,5,B00C59CJEE,"This movie is great! Personally I love independent movies and this one I like very much! This movie has great character development and great back and fourth that some movies these days just can't seem to accomplish. This is a smart, witty, heart warming comedy with real emotion and one really can relate to the characters. This is a fantastic movie and it's a must watch for anyone who loves great movies!!",1378512000,,408,4.680555555555555

8577389,5,B00C59CJEE,"After watching the behind the scenes Featurette, it became apparent that this film was made for the love of the film arts.  The producer, Gustavo Guardado, put a lot of love into this film, he carefully selected his cast and the town he grew up in.  It's a film about one's ""first love"" and everything that goes with it.  I really enjoyed so much about this film and what it represented. There are a lot of messages playing out throughout the film and the idea of knowing that sometimes communication skills among young adults can go wrong at times is evident. The real emotions that they may be feeling for the first time are difficult to understand and as a result poor decisions can happen. Culturally speaking,  I feel so fortunate to have grown up in the diverse culture that thrives in all of California.  This film reminded me of my high school years and what it was like growing up in ""anyplace"" California and getting to know other cultures through my classmates and friends.  This film is sweet and caring and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was most definitely worth the purchase and the time to watch.  I feel that the actors did a superb job.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.",1372636800,3,1195,4.546728971962617
8577390,5,B00C59CJEE,"The love story is usually an overdone cliche. This movie had none of that aftertaste in my mouth. For the most part, all of the supporting characters were artfully lighting the afterburners for Gerry and Melinda's romance. Gerry's mom was a personal favorite character for me. Her, and her role in the plot. A lot of what I saw was magic. The delightfully subtle undertones left me thinking about the movie for a few days afterwards. I absolutely loved the ending.

Buying now!",1372550400,2,477,4.746987951807229
8577391,5,B00C59CJEE,"Love, Concord (Conquered?) is a lot of fun to watch.  Laughter and tears.  Really well written, with attractive characters played by talented performers.  Brought back my high school days.  It's good to see attitudes (especially those of teenage boys toward teenage girls) haven't changed much since my days in high school (more than 50 years ago).  HINT: DO NOT turn DVD player off before the credits have rolled.  All the special features are worth watching, as well.  Good fun!",1372464000,,480,5.0
