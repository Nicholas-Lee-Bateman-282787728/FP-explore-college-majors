2303788,3,B0009NSCSU,"Pros:

The 2 1/2+ hour 'History' of the Steelers is an engaging, top-notch look at both the good and the bad times for the Steelers franchise.  Humorous, introspective, and informative, especially during the pre-dynasty days for the Steelers.

The 'profile' segment on Franco Harris and ""Franco's Italian Army"" is very nostalgic, moving, and makes you remember what was good about 70's.  Thoroughly enjoyable.

The 'profile' on Terry Bradshaw became sappy at times, but still presented a well rounded view of his estrangement and ultimate reunion with the Steeler fans, the city, the team, and Chuck Noll.  It could have better presented his strong playing ability, especially during the end of his career.  This profile also seemed somewhat 'vindictive' showing Terry as still missing the 'T' in cat.  Still a good profile.

Cons:

Certainly falls well short of the 'Complete History of the Steelers.'  I would have liked to have seen at least 10+ more 'profiles' on various players/personalities including Ham, Lambert, Rooney Sr. & Jr., Blount, Mean Joe, Swann, Stallworth, Woodson, many of the pre-70's players, and many many more stars that can be named by you or me.

Only one of the four superbowls are included.  Sounds to me like they are planning on three more 'Complete History' DVDS...Also I would have liked to have had an 'uncut' version of Superbowl XIII, and not just the 'edited' version included here.  This version is more of a 'Highlights' version along with player interviews.  Nice, but where's the uncut original?

As the title of this review says, it's light on total content.  Still well worth buying, but don't expect anything more than ""The Completely Edited History of the Steelers.""  Still, it's a step in the right direction.",1124755200,36,1755,5.076923076923077
2303789,5,B0009NSCSU,I recieved this DVD the day of the pre-season opener.  I am in the Middle east so the game came on at 3 am.  I got home and put the DVD on and could not sit down.  I had planned on taking a nap before the game but this DVD had me so hyped up I just couldn't sleep. A must have for all steelers fans.  The only thing I would have liked more is to have the other 3 superbowls like XIII on disk 1,1124236800,4,393,3.5348837209302326
2303790,5,B0009NSCSU,"The Steelers - The Complete History DVD contains two discs.  On the first disc the audience can discover the history of the Steelers in a rather interesting documentary.  Through this almost two and half-hour long documentary historical facts emerge, as well as what rests behind the winning tradition of the Steelers.

""Here we go, Steelers, here we go!""

Steelers' tradition is built on perseverance, toughness, and unity, which began in the midst of the Great Depression when Arthur Rooney bought his team into the National Football League.  It was back in 1933 when Rooney paid the sum of $2,500 to be a part of the NFL and at that time the team was called the Pirates.  The merger with Rooney's team and the NFL was a struggle, as the team did not achieve a winning season with the name Pirates.  Two years after their name change from Pirates to Steelers in 1940 they harvested their first winning season.  However, the foundation was in position, as they gained the tradition of persevere in a time of great difficulty.

In the 1950 and 60s the Steelers stepped up their game, even though the wins were few, as all opponents knew the team for its brutal toughness.  This toughness truly emerged in the 1970s when the team's defensive line acquired the nickname the Steel Curtain.  The Steel Curtain led by Mean Joe Green helped together with several other defensive players such as Jack Lambert, Ernie Holmes, and Dwight ""Mad Dog"" White to the Steelers first two Superbowl victories.

Some years later still in the 1970s, the NFL decided to change the rules due to the Steelers defensive superiority and the low scoring games.  The change brought a more open field, which made it easier to pass to the wide receivers.  A team with Terry Bradshaw at quarterback and the two deep threat wide receivers Lynn Swan and John Stallworth opened up offense for the Steelers who continued to remain tough on the football field.  They won their last Superbowl in 1980 against the Los Angeles Rams.

Although it might sound that the tough 1970s Steelers won the first two with defense and the second two with offense, it should be known that the teammates of the Steelers have always carried each other through rough and tough times, as Mean Joe Green gave his support to the Bradshaw when the confidence in him was at an all time low.  The unselfish act by Green is a commendable example of the Steelers tradition, which has unified a whole city to stand behind their yellow and black football players through any kind of adversity.  The Steelers traditions and attitudes of perseverance, toughness, and unity are still fostered by current head coach Bill Cowher.

Steelers - The Complete History comes in a stylish packaging that Steelers fans will enjoy.  The material on the two discs is definitely interesting and worth viewing for football fans and enthusiasts.  However, the audience should be aware of the poor quality of the image, which unfortunately stains the quality of the DVD.",1124150400,40,2986,4.815686274509804
2303791,5,B0009NSCSU,"As a lifetime Steelers fan, this title jumped out at me when I saw it.  The contents did not disappoint.  The feature, the NFL films Complete History of the Steelers is a 2 hour, 25 minute film covering all the ups and downs of the Steelers franchise, from the first seasons as the Pirates, to the 15-1 run in 2004, with great coverage of nearly every pivotal point in the franchise's history, both high and low.  Great coverage of the 4 Super Bowl wins and even of the seasons that made us miserable.

It was wonderful to relive games that were defining moments in my own personal sports history...from games that I was at, to games that I vividly remember watching on TV, the coverage, commentary and interviews are fantastic.

The 50 minute condensing of Super Bowl XIII is very well done, and really conveys the excitement of the game.

Add another disc of material on spotlighted players, and you've got a pretty complete package for any fan of the Steelers.",1124150400,4,963,4.60233918128655

It never really gets into a flow. It's kind of hard to imagine a DVD that rambles on and on, but somehow manages to still be vague and sketchy. The bonus features are programs you've already seen on NFL Network. Jerome Bettis ""In Their Own Words"", Bill Cowher ""In Their Own Words"" - you've already seen all that.

And the Super Bowl XIII feature? Guess what. You've already seen that too on ESPN. It's the NFL Films ""NFL's Greatest Games"" program.

You know what would be cool? NFL Films should release the original Super Bowl broadcasts. Put each one on a DVD. Sell all 5 of the Steelers' broadcasts as a package.

But why would NFL films do that? Watch them sell like wildfire? That's a terrible idea.",1148169600,9,785,4.430555555555555

The Super Bowl XIII part runs on ESPN frequently as part of the ""greatest games"" series and is not the complete game as the dvd implies.

Much of the Steeler fan base came from kids growing up in the 70's, and for us diehards like that, the DVD will still show you things you haven't seen before. I didn't know a lot about the Steelers pre-70s, other than they lost a lot of games. The documentary on Disc 1 was excellent in showing everything you need to see from the 30's-70's. Everyone has seen the image of Art Rooney holding the Lombardi trophy while chomping on a cigar. Until now, diehard fan as I am, I can't recall seeing an interview with him or even hear him speak. The DVD has several insightful interviews from Mr. Rooney and others that you will enjoy. I would like the NFL Films productions of the other three three Super Bowl games they were in, instead of just one, but that is the only detraction. A-",1135900800,5,823,4.38562091503268

2304057,4,B0009NSCSU,"I don't know where else to post this, what i'm looking for is Steeler footage by NFL Films with the legendary John Facenda narrating. Remember some of the great stuff he narrated about the Super Bowls or those winning seasons, that we used to see on TV? Can the next reviewer please include info on whether there's any Facenda on this DVD? THANKS. (It's disappointing that there's only one of the Super Bowls on here, but even though i haven't seen it, i know it deserves 5 stars simply because it's about the Steelers. :)",1126310400,2,522,4.505263157894737
2304058,4,B0009NSCSU,"this is a great set and very nice price. my only complaint would be some of the footage I already saw on NFL Network, and would have preferred some new stuff. I reccomend this one!",1126137600,3,180,4.171428571428572
2304059,5,B0009NSCSU,"This DVD set does an outstanding job of capturing the rich history of the Steelers.  It contains a lot of footage from the first 40 years before the franchise won its first playoff game as well as great coverage of the 70s up through last season.  The bonus DVD has great full-length documentaries on Terry Bradshaw, Jerome Bettis and Bill Cowher as well as shorter ones and much more.",1126051200,,385,4.565217391304348
2304060,5,B0009NSCSU,"Outstanding video of the history of the Steelers.  Well done and brings back alot of memories of the glory days of the 1970's. Recommend this DVD for all football fans, you don't have to love the Steelers to enjoy it.",1125964800,,217,4.425
2304061,5,B0009NSCSU,"As a longtime Steelers fan, I found this DVD set to be wonderful.  It brought back plenty of memories in the early days. And of course it spent a lot of time describing the best team ever in NFL History, ""The 1970's Steelers"".  When you look at the members of that team that are in the Hall of Fame, you don't need to explain why they were the best.  The features on Bill Cowher, Jerome Bettis & Terry Bradshaw were awesome.  Super Bowl XIII was a great game.  It stood out among the Steelers four Super Bowl victories.  This DVD will certainly pump up any Steelers fan for many years to come. Hopefully, there will be a few more Lombardi trophies coming in the future.  One last comment on the Bengals' fan that didn't like this DVD. ""Win a Super Bowl before making any ridiculous comments on the Steelers"".  Or at least be a respectable team sometime in the 21st Century.  And I have three final names for Cincinnati fans to savor:  JOe Montana, Jerry Rice & John Taylor.",1125446400,2,973,4.385474860335195
2304062,5,B0009NSCSU,"From the opening sequence of Disc 1, you will be captivated by this DVD set!  Nothing will get you more pumped up for the start of the season like this!  This set has something for everyone.  If you've been a Steeler fan for life, there is no doubt something new to be learned, and if you ""know it all"" than it's a great source of material to reminisce, and if you're newer to the Black and Gold, this may well be the holy grail of Steeler history.  A surprising amount of info and highlights is jammed into disc one, and it never gets boring!

As far as Disc 2, all I can say is, I think you'll be watching it over, and over, and over again.  The segments on Cowher and Bettis are amazing and really get you pumped up.  I can imagine watching the bus segment before every big game.  The whole DVD set references the past and makes allusions to big things to come for the 2005 season.  For instance, Bettis' segment ends with mention of his recent climb up the all-time rushing charts, his pay-cut last year to retire a Steeler, the fact that he's never been to a Super Bowl, and finally, it closes by mentioning that the Super Bowl will be played in his hometown of Detroit this year.  It could finish where it all began for him!  Makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end boys!!!

All I can say is, if your a Steelers fan, you have to buy this set.  What's 20 bucks for something your going to cherish for a long time???  Just don't by a new Steelers hat this season if your a tight wad.  Besides, the official sideline hat is ugly as hell this year anyway!!!  I'd honestly have to say, that if you are a Steelers fan, you should own this.  It's just the way it is.

By the way, I watched this DVD on a Widescreen TV and both Discs are indeed presented in Anamorphic Widescreen as far as I can tell, with a 1:33 aspect ratio (no black boxes at all, takes up whole screen).  The sound is Dolby 5.1 and it sounds Amazing!!!  The overall picture quality is great, but keep in mind that there is a lot of old live footage in there, so that stuff is grainy as usual.",1124928000,,2074,4.1375
