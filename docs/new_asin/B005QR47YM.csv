8483632,4,B005QR47YM,"Some early musicals are so technically primitive or badly performed, they are painful to watch. But many modern Hollywood musicals also suck in their own individual ways, from PAINT YOUR WAGON and FINIAN'S RAINBOW to MAMA MIA and (I would add) LES MIZ. But SUNNY SIDE UP is a period musical that aims low and has few pretensions. Janet Gaynor is a completely charming non-singer who gives her songs the old college try, and (apart from some over-the-top acting of the self-styled comic characters) the thin plot moves along like BEN-HUR compared to higher-aiming duds like ON WITH THE SHOW. But the hidden jewels here are a couple of songs by DeSylva, Henderson and Brown, the most popular and prolific composers of their brief collaboration together. Mrs. Gershwin once famously asked her sons George and Ira why they ""couldn't write more songs like DySylva, Henderson and Brown?"" The print quality is fine.",1363564800,3,908,4.980263157894737
