1199439,4,B00000EZTT,"It's not often I get to see a movie that isn't
1) unbelievably complicated in psychological meaning OR
2) unbelievably complicated in futuristic technology SO
I found it GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, REFRESHING, POSITIVE, AND
most of all CLEAN, HEALTHY FUN!
This is the best I've seen Richard Pryor star in, and
the real life Horatio Alger story is a real force for
success motivation, even though I am a WASP.
Only the jaded and/or mean spirited would turn this one down.",1053648000,2,463,4.8
1199440,5,B00000EZTT,"This is to the person who said this movie is based on a drag racing strip. This is a circle track movie which is not at all based upon a drag race strip. The person who even mentioned this fact should be stripped and whipped of the fact of how far these two racing professionals differ. This movie is based upon NASCAR and moonshine running, which have neither to do with true drag race technology.",1039219200,,398,4.32
1199441,5,B00000EZTT,"This is a movie that is more than a comedy, it is a movie based on the life of Wendell Scott.  It gives you some idea of how difficult it was for minorities to enter a predominately white  sport. Everyone should see it for its entertainment value, and  because it reflects on a part of American history.
Here's some trivia for you!
Did you know that Wendell Scott and Muhammad Ali have family ties?
My Grandfather, James Waddell (now deceased) from Louisville, Kentucky, is Wendell Scott's cousin.  James Waddell married my Grandmother Ms. Eva Clay.  Mrs. Eva(Clay)Waddell is the sister of Muhammad Ali's mother.
In other words, Wendell Scott's cousin married Muhammad Ali's aunt.  That's much easier to understand isn't it?
Now you have some trivia that practically no one was aware of!

1199442,4,B00000EZTT,"While not a great film, ""Greased Lightning"" is an entertaining one and provides some insight into an unsung African-American ""barrier-breaker.""  Pryor, who never got the film roles deserving of his talent, does a credible job as the main character with support given from Beau Bridges and the always-striking Pam Grier.
Also, the film has a special significance for me because I am in the ""crowd"" scenes during one of the pivotal races.  Some of the flick's exteriors were filmed at a drag strip not far from my college.  So some of my classmates and I jumped at the chance to ""star"" in a movie.  You'll have to look fast, but I'm the one with the stupid grin in the crowd.
So much for 15 minutes of fame!",971049600,7,705,4.52755905511811
1199443,4,B00000EZTT,"This man is a definite inspiration to young men that aspire to participate in the sport of automobile racing...He is a part of African- American history ie the Buffalo Soldiers, Tuskege Airmen, Old Negro League and more that is ,often, lost, forgotten or simply not mentioned.
Because of Mr.  Scott #34, and recently meeting Bobby Northfleet, the only driver in the  Craftsman Truck Series of NASCAR, we have started a junior college course  entitled ""Pit Crew Technology"" to train inner- city African-  American and Hispanic youth about the opportunities in the Motorsports  industry, besides driving> The next time you see an auto race, how many  African- American Crew Members did you see?",961027200,6,692,5.133928571428571
1199444,5,B00000EZTT,i feel that Richard Pryor does a great job of telling Wendell Scott's story.this is a film that shows another side of the genius that is Richard Pryor.dealing with the Racism on the Race Car circuit.also Pam Grier gives  a good performance as well.,949104000,3,248,4.636363636363637
1199445,5,B00000EZTT,"Way cool movie. The loosely based true story of ""Wendell Scott, the first gentleman of color to win an autombile race anywhere, anyhow"". Movie begins right after world war 2. Pryor plays a returning vet(Wendell  Scott) who cant get ahead and turns to moonshining. He eventually gets  caught but now has a reputation for hard driving and is bailed out by the  local racetrack promoter. Only problem is the good ol white boys won't let  him race and run him off the track.  Cleavon Little gives a great  performance  as Wendells partner. And Richie Havens as his mechanic. Lots  of good moonshining and racing action.",944006400,2,615,4.79047619047619

1199476,5,B00000EZTT,Loosely based on the true life story of Wendell Scott this is a must see for any NASCAR fan. The acting is wonderful and the authenticity to the period is on point. Don't let the true to life language or the not so true depiction of the Richard Petty based character keep you from enjoying this wonderful piece of Americana.,1377734400,,324,4.416666666666667

1199478,5,B00000EZTT,I rented Greased Lightning as part of a personal film project I was doing with my kids. The goal was to introduce them to films starring African-American actors that they were not familiar with.  This is one film I hadn't seen myself.  It was a great treat and started interesting discussions in the house for days to come.,1351296000,2,323,4.551724137931035
