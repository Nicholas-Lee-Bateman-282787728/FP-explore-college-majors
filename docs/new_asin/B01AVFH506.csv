8748554,4,B01AVFH506,"7-11-17 Four stars because so many of the jokes didn't work....most of them, but dang some made laugh.....so ashamed.  The film's worth viewing as I did at Netflix, but a rental fee would be worth it.  I won't detail the ups or the downs -- both come regularly throughout...including the credits.  I'm not saying there'll be a 2nd viewing on this one -- wanted a lot more A.I. super-bot stuff.  All characters just did not ring ""this is a possible person"" bell.  The characters all failed the real-world-person test.",1499817600,,516,4.752808988764045
8748555,5,B01AVFH506,"The reviews on here and IMDB aren't even close to fair. This movie is hilarious. I wouldn't call it a raunchy comedy but more of a satirical raunch com. It encapsulates gamer humor and nerd culture better than most movies today. (The sex bot finding Jesus slayed me.) It also shows blended and mixed race families in a good light - Turkleton is also a pretty great dad and it's good to see Black dads on TV.

Obviously this isn't a movie for kids, but if you liked American Pie and movies so bad they're good again, this one is for you.",1494979200,,536,4.254901960784314
8748556,4,B01AVFH506,"The bot is definitely hot, at least! From a writers perspective, good writing and directing can be the best testimony to whether or not a film is great or a failure. Though the story line and Actress playing Bardot seems pretty solid relying on the success and expectation of similar stories like Weird science. etc..the script leaves a lot to have to be improvised among the rest in order to make it work. And this would be considered the most interesting challenge for an actor. An example would be the challenge to balance the gritty dialog against the moral of the story. Doing this successfully would make for a better comedy overall as well as drive in its ultimate theme. (As excellently portrayed by the lead female actress.) There is even enough to leave room for growth: HOTBOT 2!

HOTBOT

Synopsis

Senator Biter is holding a dinner at his mansion prior to his
announcement that he's running for president. At his table,
Bardot shows up along with Limus and Leonard who
have been trying to get her back.

EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT. We see a party is going on at the Senators mansion.
Limo's are parked all along the property.

Limus and Leonard sneak onto the property. They walk up the main driveway
and slip into one of the limo's. They then exit from the other side to
the attention of security.

Limus and Leonard walk through the main entrance. Two guys in security
look at them suspiciously as they approach.

Guard 1: (to guard 2) Biter's picking them younger every year.

Guard 2: I'll say.

The guards stop Limus and Leonard in their tracks.

Guard 1: Hold up, poodleboy. Biter said He'd prefer to take his deliveries
....in the rear.

Both guards laugh. Guard 1 points back toward the driveway, winking at Limus.
The other one puckers up.

Limus, catching on to this, very gay like laughs back.

Limus: Oh. Why, thank you boys! In the rear? Of course! Definitely our specialty.

The guards laugh. Leonard looks at Limus surprised.

The other guard licks his lips, showing interest. Leonard pushes Limus onward to
avoid the guards. They wave back at them very femininely as they exit.

Guard 1: What a couple of douche bags!

The guards laugh.

Limus and Leonard head further up into a driveway that leads toward another
private entrance.

Leonard: Why did you have to overdue it?

Limus: It got us in didn't it?

Leonard: Yea, but it almost cost us our virginity.

Limus: Funny Leo! I don't think it counts when you lose yours to a foot!

They see an entrance.

Leonard: Hurry!

They get to a door, open it, and go in. They then make their way toward a hallway.

Limus: Where do you think she could be?

Leonard: Where do you think?

Leonard points upward at the next flight of stairs. As they carefully
make their way toward the stairs, a servant calls out.

Servant: Dinner is now being served, please begin making your way to the
dining room down this hall, gentlemen.

Limus and Leonard are forced to follow the crowd.

CUT TO:

INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bardot is sitting in a chair deactivated. A loud sound from outside
inadvertently causes her to activate. She then comes to life.

Standing up wearing very little, she looks around and hears sounds coming
from the hallway. She goes to the door and opens it.

Walking into the hallway, she follows several who are walking by. One
of the servants pulls her aside.

Maid: Good heavens child! You can't go down there looking like that!

The maid takes her back into her room.

CUT TO:

INT - Dining Room - Night

Biter, from a podium, addresses the crowd of people coming in to take their seats.

Biter: Welcome everybody! Please, please take your seats! First we will start by having a
delicious dinner. Afterwards I will be making a special announcement, but don't
worry it has nothing to do with the cost per plate!

Biter gets a reaction from the crowd with that one.

Biter:...It's on me tonight. Oh, and leave a little at the bottom of your
glasses for the after party celebration!

The crowd laughs.

Limus and Leonard try and enter inconspicuously. They take a seat and begin looking
around.

Limus: Do you see her?

Leonard: She's not going to be down here Doofus! She's his blow up doll!

An elderly woman, sitting nearby looks at him shockingly.

Leonard: I wasn't talking about the Senator.

Limus covers his mouth as they move on through the crowd.

Limus: Quit while your behind Leo! Sorry Ma'am.

Servants assist with the seating. Limus and Leonard attempt to seat themselves in an inconspicuous
location, but are directed to a more central seating arrangement by a servant.

Agents Koontz and Frazier are in the room looking around.

Biter's wife appears at his side as they make their way to a table. She makes a suggestion to sit
at a table where Limus and Leonard are sitting, showing a particular personal interest. She licks
her lips.

Mrs. Biter: Oh look honey. A couple of young, fresh and hungry supporters. Lets sit here.

Biter agrees until he sees that its Limus and Leonard. Biter reacts, pointing toward another table...

Biter: Honey, oh look! The Harrington's! One of our biggest supporters. Why don't we...

He see's Koontz and Frazier and signals them over.

Mrs. Biter: Nonsense!

Biter, Limus and Leonard each realize they are in each others presence. The Biter's take their seats
with them.

Mrs. Biter: Pleased to meet you, gentlemen.

Cut to:

INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bardot has on a dress appropriate for the occasion. She looks at herself in the mirror along with the
servant.

Servant: This looks inconspicuous enough. Come one, I better get you out through one of the side exits before they
see you.

Bardot hesitates.

Bardot: Why? Won't this turn him on?

Servant: Turn him on? it seems lately that anything walking upright that's easily accessible
turns him on. But we've got to get you home, his wife is here!

Bardot: Wife? You think she would be into having a threesome or even group sex maybe?

Servant: Girl, what planet are you from?

8748557,5,B01AVFH506,"Dispite what some people say, I thought this was a rather funny, good movie with heart & lots of nods to Kevin smiths films.....remember, there are much worse shows & movies out there, so just relax and give your brain some time off",1468540800,,232,4.4186046511627906
8748558,1,B01AVFH506,"I hate to give 1 star to a movie with mostly decent actors and a respected director, but Hot Bot is mostly excruciating to sit through.

PROs
 Oh how the mighty have fallen: Angela Kinsey, who most Americans would probably recognize as ""Angela"" from The Office, steals the show when she is onscreen in Hot Bot (which isn't often enough to make the flick worth watching). Most of the cast is well-picked, but when you put poop (the script) into a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fancy-400-food-processor/dp/B005I6ZKCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fancy $400 food processor</a>&nbsp;(the actors), it still comes out as poop.
 For what it's worth, I'd never seen somebody chainsaw their way out of a car trunk...
 Blade Runner reference. One brief scene spoofs the 1982 sci-fi classic... cue Vangelis-like music, and a neo-noir setting... Benny: ""I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Just relax, and answer them as simply as you can."" Bardot: ""Do you mind if I smoke?"" Benny: ""It won't effect the test.""

CONs
 Oh jeez, where to begin? Let's start with the script: it's so godawful in most spots that after the first few minutes you stop cringing and just become exhausted from the soul-crushing banality, tediousness, and [insert here whatever the term is for ""opposite of funny""].
 You could be forgiven for assuming Hot Bot is written for adolescent boys, but as it turns out, that's an insult to most non-autistic boys ages 12 and older. It was written for teens of three decades years ago, and this is problematic for at least a couple of reasons, chief among them: we are not living in 1986! Perhaps the social demographic for this would be ""teen sex comedy"" is 18-year-old young men who've very recently had the opportunity to break away from strict religious communities they were raised in and haven't yet seen movies featuring extremely foul-mouthed youths and an overabundance of inane sex talk.

Pro or Con (it depends on why you're watching): Bardot is played by Cynthia Kirchner, who isn't actually an actress -- but she isn't not hot either.
I realize I've listed more Pros than Cons above, it's just the Cons are so pronounced that it tips the scales irrevocably.

I'll include the most humorous exchange below, which will save you from having to watch Hot Bot:
Upon walking into a room, mother Candy Huffington (Angela Kinsey) sees her son Limus with Bardot.
Candy: ""Oh, you have company. Who do we have here? Does your friend have a name?""
Limus: ""....No..."" [stated almost like a question]
Candy: ""That's a very exotic name! Is it Chinese? What does No mean?""
Bardot: ""No means no.""
Candy: ""I like you already! Limus, do you understand our rule about having girls in your room?""
Limus: ""Mom, please, you're being a cock block.""
You can guess how Candy reacts to this, and to make matters worse, Bardot explains in very technical terms what cock block means. As mentioned before, Angela Kinsey is the one bright spot in Hot Bot, but ultimately only a tease as to what could have been.",1460764800,,3047,4.982283464566929
8748559,2,B01AVFH506,"Hot Bot is an American sex comedy. Which means there's no sex and no comedy.

And that is all that needs to be said about it.",1457740800,3,125,3.8076923076923075
8748560,2,B01AVFH506,"A German company manufactures a sex robot (Cynthia Kirchner) and it is sent to a US senator ( Larry Miller) who doesn't get it. Instead it lands in the hands of two dorky teens (Zack Pearlman, Doug Haley) who try to hold on to her as a dysfunctional FBI comes after them.

There was a lot less sex and nudity that one would expect from the title and DVD cover. One can't help but make comparisons to ""Weird Science"" an 80's  PG-13 classic ""teen sex comedy."" The humor was more juvenile than clever, overusing shocking sexual statements as a source of cheap jokes. We know how these films always end. I felt uncomfortable while the teens sat there and swore at their parents, calling them stupid while using profanity. While I don't mind profanity, especially when the Bot used it, their using it in this scene sucked the humor from it. This may have a lot of teen appeal.

You might want to consider watching ""Weird Science"" again if you're over 30.

Guide: Plenty of swearing, some implied sex, brief Cynthia Kirchner (or body double) nudity. Chasty Ballesteros provides early hot Asian tease nudity.",1457740800,2,1101,4.65979381443299
8748561,2,B01AVFH506,"An actor trying too hard to be like Jonah Hill and his dork friend find themselves in possession of a $500,000 pleasure bot that escaped the transportation of being delivered to it's new owner, whom is a senator. He sends his goons out to find her and track her down. The boys find themselves mixed up a bunch of stuff with the goons and a guy who works in an adult toy store.

Sound pretty thin so far? It is. What seems like it could almost be a plot for Weird Science II or a sequel to National Lampoons Repli-Kate, it fails miserably by not delivering a good enough story, too many confusing moments that make no sense, too much of a push to try and make something funny that falls flat, and a pretty bad choice of lead actors. I guess whomever wrote the script had Jonah Hill in mind, but what they got was someone painful to watch as he impersonated him badly. The other ""Drama"" and ""Love"" stories of the film are pretty bad and unbelievable. You just don't care about the characters.

Even during the end credits I have not seen such fake out-takes since Mr Accident. Nothing they goof up was at all funny to the viewing audience. One particular scene showed the real side of the lead actress playing the Bardot robot, and she seemed pretty arrogant and pig headed and really not wanting to be in the same room as the two poorly cast leading boys.

You might know a few names and faces here, but none of them add any value to the film. Everyone was miscast and misplaced, so I don't recommend checking it out even if you where someone who couldn't get enough of Scrubs, That 70's Show, Anthony Whats-his-name and that bald guy no one knows the name of.

If you have not seen Weird Science, Repli-kate, Short Circuit or even Terminator... don't watch this one, start with the good ones, and then avoid watching this one even if curiosity gets the better of you. It has minor chuckles at the start, but becomes boring and eye rolling by the middle and you wanna punch the main guys in the face by the end and tell them to never try to act ever again.",1457568000,3,2055,4.32987012987013
