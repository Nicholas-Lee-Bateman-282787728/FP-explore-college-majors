Sadly, it was his last feature film. It is still a pure masterpiece from beginning to end.",1514851200,,268,4.0754716981132075

8242861,2,B0011X51Z4,"I haven't been able to play this DVD because it's a region 2 which is Europe and only ""region free"" DVD players or European ones can play region 2. North America is region 1. I don't think the product description made it clear that this was a region 2. I ended up choosing to buy the WC Fields Comedy Collection to get a playable version of ""The Bank Dick,"" because it made more sense to me to spend $35 to get 5 movies as opposed to $20 to get a region 1 version of The Bank Dick (the Criterion Collection version). I'm pretty sure the seller would have taken it back had I tried, but at the point in time this happened I simply didn't have the time to do that. Am holding on to it in case I ever get a region free DVD player (which can be had for around $45).",1330041600,,761,3.980392156862745
