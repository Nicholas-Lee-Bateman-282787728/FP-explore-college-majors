8176888,3,B000NDFI7E,When the actress spits a coin out of her mouth that is code for what the foreigners were doing to China - taking good silver out and trading it for worthless money.,1410652800,,164,4.15625
8176889,4,B000NDFI7E,"This double feature provides an interesting view of the state of filmmaking in China in the 1930s. While Hollywood films were certainly not unknown in China, and indeed were admired and sought-after in urban areas when available, their influence here is slight enough (despite 'Street Angel's' reference to an earlier Borzage film) and these two films reflect a mostly indigenous style.

Both stories proceed on a relatively low key, and may try the patience of viewers who prefer a story line that glides along swiftly. But there's a lot of warmth and humor here, particularly in the scenes in which Zhou and Zhao flirt charmingly with each other from their windows on opposite sides of the street -- with songs, magic tricks, and a trumpet!

The visual and aural quality of the DVD leave a lot to be desired, but with some good performances, and as a record of the time, both films are well worth viewing.",1237334400,3,907,4.770700636942675
8176890,2,B000NDFI7E,"Fans of the film ""Lust Caution"" will recognize the original rendition of ""Wandering Songstress"" sung by Zhou Xuan. She certainly carries this film which portrays the plight of the poor, influenced by silent Hollywood comedies of the era. A placid love story and not too preachy.",1207353600,2,278,5.065217391304348
