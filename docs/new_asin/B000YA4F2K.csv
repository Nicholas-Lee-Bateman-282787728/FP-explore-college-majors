3025643,5,B000YA4F2K,I am about to enter my third trimester and have used these exercise DVDs throughout my first and second.  They have been great so far.  The 20 minute yoga sessions are great for those days when I'm too tired to do the cardio and toning and have helped a lot with back pain I've had.  The cardio and toning is also great and has just the right intensity for my pregnancy.  There is a lot of variety to the routines so it keeps it from being boring.  I also like that there are different DVDs for each stage of my pregnancy as well as after the baby is born.,1256688000,,556,4.064220183486238
3025644,5,B000YA4F2K,"I purchased two workout videos and this is the one that I reach for first.  It is challenging but provides you with alternate moves if you are feeling tired.  The other nice thing is that since the workouts are divided into trimesters, you aren't stuck with the same workout all the way through.  The workout and yoga sessions are seperate, so if you are really beat you can opt for the 20 minute yoga to assure that you are stretching out those tired muscles.  I don't deal well with an over-enthusiastic instructor, and Lindsay is chipper but not annoying.",1245456000,,558,4.606060606060606
3025645,4,B000YA4F2K,"This is a great pregnancy DVD.  I wish it were more intense, but I'm satisfied with my workout when I'm finished.  I thought there were two different workouts with each DVD, but really it's just the same workout with a fast or slow start option.  The yoga is awesome.",1240963200,,267,4.408163265306122
3025646,5,B000YA4F2K,"SO WORTH THE MONEY! I am 15 weeks pregnant with my third baby. With my first two, all I did was walk during pregnancy... these videos are a great option to keep you in awesome shape not only with cardio but also toning. I love that you can use any light or heavy weights that suit your needs. She also has women that are doing modified versions of the exercises if you're too tired that day. I love the Yoga section too! It has kept me very flexible and I'm even finding improvement in my flexibility! These videos are just challenging enough, but not exhausting at all. I never had morning sickness with my first two pregnancies but have experienced all day sickness with this pregnancy. I was shocked to find that if I could just motivate myself to do the 1st trimester video, I felt SO MUCH BETTER! It was amazing! I never thought that exercising would help with feeling sick in the 1st trimester! I love the post-natal bootcamp too. I had amazing success with it after my second baby... actually, better success than I ever imagined having! (getting back to my weight from when I was a freshman in high school!) I will definitely use it again after this baby comes! Great buy and so worth the money! You can't go wrong with any of Lindsay's products. My house is full of them!",1209081600,7,1280,4.427966101694915
3025647,5,B000YA4F2K,"I loved this prenatal/postnatal set. Most prenatal workout videos (I have a lot of them) were too easy for me and I felt like I was not getting anything out of them, but these were safe AND challenging, which was refreshing. Having the workouts broken down by trimester was very helpful, and Lindsay was usually right on with what I was able to do at each point in the pregnancy. The yoga section left a little to be desired for me, so I usually just subbed my own yoga workout for the one on the DVD, but it is probably ok for someone who does not already do yoga regularly and isn't picky.
The postnatal boot camp video is also WONDERFUL. There are tons of different options and workouts to choose from and they are challenging enough to actually help you get back into shape, unlike most other postnatal workouts that I have seen. Although the workouts are challenging, she provides modifications to make things easier for those who still need to work up to the advanced level. This is the best series that I have seen for pregnant women.",1205971200,28,1041,4.484210526315789
3025648,5,B000YA4F2K,I loved doing Lindsay Brin's videos during my pregnancy.  I thought the exercies and moves were easy to follow.  I'm not the most coordinated person (especially when pregnant!) but I was definitely able to do all the moves and exercises.  I liked that she had alternative moves to do when I felt tired or when I couldn't keep up.  The videos are definitely geared for safe exercising during pregnancy and each video was directed and individualized for each trimester.  I also liked that the videos gave me options between two workout programs and 2 yoga programs.  I liked to switch between them so that I didn't get bored.  They really helped with my energy level and helped me keep a positive attitude about myself.  I would definitely recommend these videos to anyone during pregnancy.,1203465600,2,788,4.8283582089552235
3025649,5,B000YA4F2K,Love these workouts especially because there is a disk for each trimester and wishing the video they have a beginner and advanced person to watch so if you have already been working out you still have a challenge,1465776000,,212,4.605263157894737
3025650,2,B000YA4F2K,"Content of video is good, but my first trimester DVD skipped about 75-80% of the time. Made it extremely difficult to continue workout when it was constantly skipping and cutting out. Very annoying.",1465430400,,198,5.03030303030303

3025652,4,B000YA4F2K,"I ran regularly before this pregnancy, so at first I scoffed at the second trimester cardio workout, but by the end of the workout, and especially with the inclusion of the weights, I did notice my breathing was faster and heart rate was elevated, though I did not break a sweat. I like it for the toning.",1463961600,,305,4.368421052631579
3025653,2,B000YA4F2K,"I have to say I agree with many of the reviews. I am currently at the end of my 2nd trimester and I do use the DVDs, however: her instructions are almost off sometimes, and the camera does not zoom in on the movements to show you! The word bun cakes is annoying. The quality of the filming is low. The yoga section is too short. There are many mistakes in the video which make it confusing for you, and hard to follow. I bought the DVDs so I am doing them, but I would not recommend them.",1460246400,2,488,3.989795918367347
3025654,5,B000YA4F2K,LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.,1459123200,,66,5.7
3025655,5,B000YA4F2K,Love this DVD set! Into the 2nd trimester now and I love both workouts so far. Not too hard but not too easy that I don't get a workout from it.,1457740800,,144,3.6774193548387095
3025656,1,B000YA4F2K,I didn't really like this video.  I did the 3rd trimester video.  It was combined cardio and toning.  I have many other non maternity videos that work better with keeping all the moves as low impact and have better music.  Do not recommend.,1456531200,,240,4.511627906976744
3025657,1,B000YA4F2K,"Don't buy this unless you can actually confirm there is yoga!! Each of these discs claim to have a yoga sections but they actually don't. I contacted Moms Into Fitness and they said they are aware of this. The yoga sections were removed to lower the price, but they used the same audio track. So Again and again you hear Lindsay say ""you can always do our yoga section blah blah"" but there isn't a yoga section. This is not and ""complete pregnancy workout"". It even gives you a schedule on the discs, days 1,3,5 cardio and toning, days 2 & 4 yoga and toning...awesome no yoga. I feel scammed!",1451952000,2,592,4.390909090909091
3025658,3,B000YA4F2K,"I'm a very actice person, but as a FTM, I was nervous about what I was ""allowed"" to do. My doctor wanted me to keep it light, so this DVD seemed like a god idea. I bought it really excited for the bootcamp part post-natal. The only issue I really had was the constant freezing of the DVD for both the 1st and 2nd trimester workouts. I haven't done the 3rd trimester yet (almost there!), but I feel the same issue will occur. This has been tested on multiple players with the same result. The weird thing is, the DVDs aren't sratched up at all. I found it difficult to keep with my breathing when the workout would go in and out constantly. If you find the DVDs don't freeze, then this package is really great. This is the only complaint I have.",1448496000,,744,4.20979020979021
3025659,5,B000YA4F2K,"I have done the dvd a few times and I liked it.  I had to hold off for my first trimester by doctors orders, just because we had to monitor an RH negative symptom. Although I am allowed to do the yoga portion using my judgement.  I will probably start up again 2nd trimester once I get the all clear.",1447027200,,300,3.9833333333333334
3025660,3,B000YA4F2K,"I liked the first trimester DVD, but as soon as I got to the 2nd trimester dvd, both the yoga and cardio workouts were freezing/skipping every 1 minute or so which gets very annoying, and it is only that DVD. Its too late to return it, but I am not going to check all the DVDs when I get it, I will watch it when I get to that trimester. super disappointed.",1446508800,,357,3.9722222222222223
3025661,2,B000YA4F2K,"Workout is great, quality not. Skips every 2-4 minutes. Aggravating! Can't return now.",1440201600,,86,5.6923076923076925

3025663,2,B000YA4F2K,"I wasn't too impressed with this DVD set.  To give context, I normally enjoy Jillian Michaels workouts (30 Day shred is in the regular rotation) and I work out five days per week for at least 30 minutes each time.  I found this DVD to be too easy in terms of intensity, just not challenging enough even in pregnancy,  but also a little difficult/complicated to follow as I was working out - the moves didn't seem to be intuitive and the cardio routines transitioned too quickly from move to move to really get into any of them.  I agree with other reviewers that Lindsay herself is a little cloying, but that really wasn't a deal-breaker for me.  I'm sure this would be a fine workout for someone who wasn't working out regularly before, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who was in pretty good shape to begin with.
I also received a DVD copy that was very poorly burned - the picture skipped every few seconds, but the audio seemed intact.  Needless to say, I returned it because it was a defective copy, but I would have returned it anyway - just not for me.",1428278400,,1064,4.403061224489796
3025664,3,B000YA4F2K,Was too much of a workout for me when I was pregnant.,1427587200,,53,3.5
3025665,5,B000YA4F2K,"I'm still on the first trimester so I've only used the first DVD, but I absolutely love this prenatal fitness DVD.  I worked out regularly before pregnancy, and this video is for sure challenging enough for a newly pregnant women.  You will definitely break a sweat.  I actually could see it being a bit hard for those women who didn't workout regularly before pregnancy, but she has easier modified versions for those who find it too difficult.  I was hesitant to order it at first for I saw a couple bad reviews about graphics covering up instructions and her use of the word buncakes, but I believe they are over exaggerated comments.  There are only two quick graphics which she has already showed you the simple moves, so there is absolutely no problems following the DVD.  She says the word buncakes only a few times.  Nothing excessive by anymeans.  I highly recommend this DVD!!!",1423526400,,887,4.714285714285714

3025667,5,B000YA4F2K,"Love this workout.; however she does go through some of the moves too quickly.
Definitely got me sweating
The post natal DVD is amazing! You can mix and match routines",1418774400,,167,4.6
3025668,5,B000YA4F2K,I used this through two pregnancies and to kick-start my weight loss afterward. They're great exercises that are challenging but not overly complicated. I pretty much loved this set.,1418342400,,182,5.310344827586207

3025672,2,B000YA4F2K,"Linsay seems knowledgeable on pregnancy fitness, and has put together a great network of useful information for Moms. This would be a great beginner or moderate DVD. That being said, personally I am used to more high intensity, like Jillian Michaels and Body Combat. Obviously its important to not over do it while pregnant. However I felt I was at about a 3 of Lindsay's recommended 5-8 on a scale of exertion. I will probably keep this set for the postnatal boot camp portion, and with OBs consent maintain my current regimen, modified as needed.",1410393600,,548,4.778947368421052
3025673,5,B000YA4F2K,"Love this DVD. You actually get a good workout, its not too easy. Love how it is broken down into each trimester and it has yoga with each trimester as well. She does a good job explaining what is safe and what isn't when working out during pregnancy. Overall its worth the buy.",1410048000,,278,4.264150943396227
3025674,1,B000YA4F2K,"I read Brin's book and really enjoyed it so I ordered this DVD set on Amazon. I felt really discouraged by it. I am very fit, I biked 6 miles the weekend before my son was born if that tells you anything :o), but I just couldn't follow the routines at all! Part of the problem is that the camera keeps panning away so that you cannot see what the individuals who are leading the exercise program are doing, and then there were rapid transitions, so I was constantly out of step. I am big into cycling and jogging. I also enjoy swimming, yoga and aerobics. If you have a background in cheerleading and dance as Brin does, and maybe need few visual cues to follow a routine, this DVD May be for you. If you are fit, but are need more visual cues you may find it extremely discouraging like I did.

3025675,4,B000YA4F2K,Overall I really like these videos. I must say that Lindsay's constant smiling gets a little bit annoying after you do these videos day after day. But I have definitly seen much more annoying fitness instructors than her. I wish there was more focus on core strengthening but her attention to the upper back muscles has been very beneficial and has noticably helped prevent back pain during my pregnancy. Also her cues for you to activate your back muscles and take the sway out of your back has been a very useful tool in relieving back aches. Good videos all around.,1406160000,,568,4.633663366336633
3025676,5,B000YA4F2K,"The Yoga portion has been a lifesaver for my back and her exercises are structured to prepare your muscles for birth.  I admittedly was not a bit work out queen before getting pregnant, so this is a good pace to keep me toned and stretched as the belly grows.",1401840000,,259,4.285714285714286
3025677,1,B000YA4F2K,"I don't get how this video series gets such great reviews. Lindsay has no rhythm at all, and to consistently get off the beat is just maddening. Her cueing is horrible, and the words she uses for body parts (buncakes?!) is just outright immature and annoying.  I couldn't even make it through a workout before I pushed eject in utter frustration. Don't waste your money.",1401321600,,370,4.6923076923076925
3025678,4,B000YA4F2K,Truly loved this workout! I stayed in great shape entire pregnancy. I am going to keep the DVDs For my next pregnancy. Thanks!,1399420800,,126,4.521739130434782
3025679,4,B000YA4F2K,"....however, I see why she did it. Just in case you want to work out with your kids in the room, they won't pick up the word ""butt"" if you would prefer they use words like ""bottom"" or ""rear"" - you know what I mean. Rear-end would have worked? Anyway, if you can get past ""bun cakes"" this is actually a pretty effective workout. The filming quality is mediocre, and her workout assistants look like two dear caught in headlights, but if you can get past alllll of that, you will sweat! Still looking for that perfect prenatal workout DVD, but until then this will work just fine :)",1397520000,,580,4.330275229357798

3025681,5,B000YA4F2K,"I'm only in my first trimester, so I haven't done all of the DVDs yet, but I really love this workout! Before I got pregnant I use to be pretty active; I was always doing Jillian Michael's workouts.  I wake up sore after I do this workout. Not a bad sore, but a good sore. I still feel fit. I know that this will help keep me fit and not gain excess pregnancy weight gain. I love the yoga and look forward to it. I know you are suppose to add cardio to yoga day, I haven't done that because of time, but once that is implemented it's a worth while program! The word ""bun cakes"" dies not bother me, she really doesn't say it that much. Love thus workout, defiantly would recommend it to anyone!",1395273600,2,693,4.095588235294118
3025682,2,B000YA4F2K,"The workouts are ok and one of the few that actually gets me sweating, but the awful music as well as her talking had me putting this workout to rest stat.  I get that we're all going to be mommies-to-be but it doesn't mean you can't say glutes or seat or something grown up when we're working out instead of ""buncakes"".  It would be one thing if she just said it once, but she says it constantly.  I did the 1st and 2nd trimester (each one maybe twice)  and I just couldn't bear to do it anymore because I thought I might have an aneurysm.",1392336000,,540,4.114285714285714
3025683,5,B000YA4F2K,"Used this series for 2 of my 3 pregnancies and I love them. They make me feel great, use all of the write muscles and help keep my body from totally going to hell. I find if I don't do her workout for a week or so, my back starts aching again.
The only Con- is that if its your only source of exercise ( Like during a bitter winter where you cant leave the house for walks, etc...) then it can get a little boring after several weeks. Change it up a bit with other DVD's or exercise methods to prevent workout boredom.
All in all, this lady is a guru when it comes to pre-natal AND post-natal workouts. Check out her other more recent series too.",1390435200,2,646,4.0546875
3025684,4,B000YA4F2K,"I loved the cardio/toning workouts, but the yoga sessions on this DVD set got me through pregnancy.  After a long day on my feet, these re-energized me and helped me keep a lot of the tone in my arms.

Best of all, the music is not annoying and Lindsay is unbearably cute.  She's not in your face, she's very calming.  And there are modified exercises for those days when you're moving a bit slower.

Note: this will make husbands laugh when they walk in on you doing yoga at 8 months pregnant :)",1389657600,,496,4.290322580645161
3025685,2,B000YA4F2K,"In the beginning of the DVD, Lindsay specifically states that she recommends doing the cardio and yoga on opposite days which to me indicates that there is a separate yoga section.  This is definitely not the case.  I spent several minutes going through each DVD just to make sure.  The ""yoga"" section is simply a few poses at the end of each DVD that went by so quickly, I wasn't even sure that's what it was.  While the cardio did elevate my heart rate, I was disappointed by the seemingly false advertising of the ""yoga"" section indicated here on Amazon and on the DVD's themselves.",1385510400,6,585,4.542857142857143

3025687,1,B000YA4F2K,"I'm really disappointed about this exercise DVD. I was hoping to get an exercise regimen geared for someone who regularly exercises (before and through pregnancy) and this DVD hardly felt like exercise. The cardio portions didn't challenge me at all from a heartrate perspective but the aerobic foot work changed so frequently, it was ineffective, confusing and slightly ridiculous. The toning parts are ok but nothing that most people don't do already (if they use weights). Plus all of the exercises are only completed 1 time. Im currently in my 3rd trimester and wanted to start using pregnancy DVD's to break up my regular routine but this will not be incorporated since it was a total waste of time. I used Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout last week- and though I can tell she may get on my nerves after a while, the workout was much more effective",1381708800,,853,4.809523809523809

Love the workouts and the yoga sections are wonderful for relieving the aches and pains of expanding joints!! Only a few minor complaints about the videos, I wish they continued the end of the yoga section longer so you can really take the time to relax and focus a bit longer, they end quite abruptly. So far I'm only in the 2nd trimester but I look forward to the next section and can hardly wait to start the boot camp once cleared after delivery.",1372464000,,560,4.394230769230769
3025690,4,B000YA4F2K,"I have been doing these DVDs since I first found out I was pregnant (currently halfway through my second trimester) and they have been great. Before pregnancy, I did pretty high-impact workouts like Jillian Michaels, Billy Blanks, and Jackie Warner, so I was concerned with maintaining the same types of workouts, just at a lower intensity. Lindsay's workouts do a good job of challenging me while focusing on each trimester's individual challenges. She gives a lot of commentary on what you may be going through and changes you should be making due to your growing belly, which I like since this is my first pregnancy. She alternates between toning and cardio segments; the toning segments are more challenging to me since the cardio segments are very low-impact and tame. She gives variations to the workouts using her two assistants so if something doesn't feel good to you one day, you can adjust your movements to help rather than harm yourself. Lindsay herself has a very chipper and optimistic personality, and she hasn't gotten on my nerves yet (except for referring to your butt as ""buncakes"") so that's a plus!",1369440000,2,1120,4.931216931216931
3025691,4,B000YA4F2K,First tri had me breathless and worried a bit about going over 140 BPM on heartrate. Second Tri is better as it separates the weight workout from the cardio workout.  So far I dig.,1367971200,,180,4.294117647058823
3025692,2,B000YA4F2K,"I recently purchased this four DVD set.  It clearly states on the box that prenatal yoga is included.  On the ""before you begin"" section on the second trimester DVD Lindsay herself tells you that on days 1,3, and 5 she wants you to do cardio and toning, and days 2 and 4 she wants you to do yoga and cardio.  There is some yoga at the very end of the workout, but she does not say ""Now we're going to do yoga.""  If you aren't familiar with yoga you wouldn't have any idea where the cardio section ends and the yoga section begins.  Also, half of what she is calling yoga is not even yoga.  You HOLD a pose for yoga.  You don't do reps.  That is NOT yoga.  This is blatant false advertising.

I am familiar with yoga so I was able to pick out what she is claiming is yoga, but there are only SIX MINUTES of yoga on each DVD.  Six minutes!  I bought these DVDs for the yoga, and there is pretty much NO YOGA.  Yoga is not just a cool down.  It's a necessary workout during pregnancy to help increase your flexibility and core strength, and prepare you for labor and delivery. I am not just spouting nonsense--I worked for several years as a labor and delivery nurse.

I am complete unsatisfied with this workout set.  I do not recommend it for any pregnant woman.  You'd be better off getting anything else.",1367193600,,1305,4.218623481781377
3025693,5,B000YA4F2K,"These DVD's take you through each trimester offering safe exercises with different moderation levels for each workout. This was important to me as I always worry about doing something I am not supposed to when I am pregnant. I am a worrier.

Each trimester DVD has a cardio/toning component {which I love} and a prenatal yoga component {which I am coming to like more and more as this pregnancy progresses - I am not a big Yoga person}. I prefer the toning cardio workouts first thing in the morning to kick start my day.

The prenatal 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester DVD's keep you moving at a good pace so you do not feel like you have to pause the DVD in order to keep up with the routine, while the Post Natal Boot Camp DVD moves at a faster pace forcing you to push through.

The Post Natal Boot Camp DVD has a ton of variations - keeping the workout constantly fresh! You can create your own combo or follow the program the DVD has set up {I bought this DVD after I had my first child and followed the program. It was the variation and intensity I needed in order to get back in my pre-pregnancy clothing}.

Lindsay herself is a very upbeat energetic character who I enjoy working out with and listening to. It has made working out fun.

The cardio workouts require weights {2 sets -one light and one heavier} but there are modifications for each workout and if it is too much you are encouraged to go to the lighter weights.

I really liked these DVD's and have used the Post Natal Bootcamp DVD after all of my pregnancies to help me get my body back. I am a big fan of this program and if we have a baby #4 I know that I will use it again. It is not too hard and it is not too easy. It is enjoyable and can be tailored to suit your level of intensity.

I was given a copy of this DVD program for the purposes of a blog review on ""Mom Mart"" and enjoyed it so much that I am sharing my thoughts and opinions here as well.",1367193600,,1923,4.13941018766756

I was always going to the gym and doing intense boot camp style classes, so when I found out I was pregnant, I was worried about what was too intense and what was still safe. Having a DVD dedicated to each trimester made the guesswork go away! I thought Lindsay's positive, upbeat attitude made the workouts go quickly.

I definately notice a difference when I do these DVD's at least 2-3 times a week in how I feel--less back pain and more energy. I'm now 37 weeks and still doing them twice a week along with walking. I highly recommend!!",1365638400,2,563,4.413461538461538

3025698,3,B000YA4F2K,"First I will start off by saying that the time length is great, I have a 2 year old and the fact that the works outs are 30 minutes is perfect! Exactly what I was looking for, enough to get a decent work out, but I actually have time to complete it. Second the work out is a decent one and does hit all the major muscle groups. So now the downside, I have to completely agree with a prior review, if she says ""buncakes"" one more time I am going to vomit! Seriously? Ok once it might be cute, but she does this over and over without ever using the correct anatomic terminology. Second, she reminds you of how fat you are getting and that she is not, ""Now on myself you will see this nice hollow out action...(of your stomach)..."" OK, I know I will not see it when I am pregnant! I am doing this video to feel better about myself now, not to remind myself what my stomach looked like before I was pregnant! Anyway these are petty, and over all the work out itself is fine. The Yoga, could be better. It is not as relaxing as I would like in so far as I would like some nice music or peaceful ambiance in the back ground, but she just goes through the poses to regular work out music like going through regular stretches, which is ok for the stretching, but I would like something a little extra for the mental health.

Sometimes the music was bland so all we did was plug in our pandora radio to the surround sound and sweated our a**es off!!!!!!!! I have lost 6 lbs since I have more muscle.

The instructor does get annoying and does say buncake A LOT...but it did turn into a joke to see how many times she will say it. The yoga workout was great and I really enjoyed all the stretching and breathing exercises.

3025709,3,B000YA4F2K,"When I start googling for pregnancy exercise, I stumbled upon Lindsay Brin's website which describes her fitness journey during pregnancy. Lindsay is easy for the eyes, very nice to watch her which is why I decided to purchase this DVD.
The programs were divided by trimester and I started using from the second to the third trimester program. Although I pretty munch enjoy doing these exercise programs, I found the background music is just so terrible. It was just music playing the same melody over and over again which at certain point I find it irritating.",1338595200,,561,4.854166666666667
3025710,1,B000YA4F2K,"This is by far the worst prenatal DVD I've done during my pregnancy because the production quality is low, because Lindsay is an awful instructor, and because the actual exercises are ineffective.

There are two basic camera angles, and oftentimes when she is trying to illustrate something (like a sway back) she and one of the pregnant ladies are facing the camera, so you can't actually see the back. Sometimes they are doing a back exercise but the camera is focused on just their bodies. There are also multiple points at which she is transitioning between exercises, but the camera is focused on the ""modifying"" exerciser rather than the instructor so you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing. In the third trimester video in particular, she frequently looks at and gives instructions to the wrong camera.

Lindsay also sometimes says that she is going to do one thing, like push ups, but then goes into a stretch instead. In the third trimester video, she even forgets to do the side plank on the opposite side. It is a travesty that she didn't include Kegels on the third trimester workout.

I enjoyed some of the toning exercises but did not find the cardio to be useful at all. I did everything like she did, but my heart rate went up less than when I take a brisk walk. Like other reviewers, I found her timing to be off with the music.

The two back-up exercisers frequently are frequently off beat, making it distracting. I find it hilarious that Lindsay attempts to sell you the ill-fitting and ugly workout clothes they are wearing.

This video is not for mamas-to-be who are already in good shape! I much prefer the Perfect Pregnancy Workout.",1337731200,6,1668,4.659863945578231
3025711,1,B000YA4F2K,"When I bought this set of DVDs I was looking for something that would really work me out, but also keep in mind that I was pregnant. I was used to doing Jillian Michaels DVDs and wanted something that would kick my butt like that - after reading reviews and looking at several different ""pregnancy work out"" DVDs I decided to try Lindsay Brin since the reviews were generally great, saying it was good cardio etc. - I have to disagree; I could barely get through 1 workout because I was so bored. She's a darling girl and I loved her personality but I was really hoping for something intense and a much faster pace - I haven't tried the yoga, and will for sure since I've been unable to do my regular yoga due to the expanding belly, but the cardio and toning aren't something I'll do again - I just need a little bit more to feel satisfied in my workouts - but that's just me! I know a lot of others have liked it and get a good workout from it!",1335916800,3,946,4.146739130434782
3025712,5,B000YA4F2K,"I've been using the 1st Trimester DVD+Yoga (about 30 minutes each) together several times per week for about 3 weeks now. Since the first time I did the video, I immediately began to see results in my energy levels, toned appearance, flexibility, posture and overall feeling of well-being. I was already my ideal weight when I started the exercise program, and I am now 7 weeks pregnant. I feel refreshed and energized after the video and yet like I got a good workout in for the day (cardio & toning as well as flexibility) in a reasonable amount of time (during my 12 month old's nap!).

The negative critique has been that Lindsay Brin uses the word ""buncakes"" to refer to the glutes. Yes, she does. But if you can get over that/overlook it (which personally if you're in the middle of a workout concentrating on your body movements should be easy to do!), she is fine. The question is, does the use of a local ""slang"" word negate all of Lindsay Brin's exercise fitness competency? No it doesn't. True, I had never heard of her before, this is not a high budget video and the other two girls in the video are probably her friends, but the bottom line is she...
- Reminds you to breathe
- Correctly explains the posture and positioning for each exercise
- Uses common,  not-overly-complicated moves in comfortable sequencing
- Doesn't talk more than necessary to be distracting
- Provides modifications throughout the entire workout (with one girl actually being pregnant in the video) to provide lesser or greater challenges
- Gives plenty of reminders to keep an activated back, drink water, prompts to switch exercises, flows easily from move to move
- Incorporates many popular, favorite exercises seen in other videos but with pregnancy needs in mind
- And best of all, provides a solid, balanced workout that yields results quickly & easily
- Great for beginners wanting to learn some good moves and the more fit looking for a solid workout (YOU determine how hard you want to work)
- And of course, the fact that it is segmented by trimester goes without saying: Convenient!

Several Exercise Examples from 1st Trimester video:
- Squats
- Lunges
- Bicep Curls
- Tricep Over-head Raises
- Dumbbell Bent-Over Raises
- Plank Position
- 8 count Pushups
- Situps

Note: Beginners would do well to master the FORM of each of these exercises (You must hold your body correctly! if you feel awkward, like you're twisting, ect you are probably not in the correct position or you should drop the weights until you have mastered the move! You will not be disappointed once you can do it correctly however. You can do these moves the rest of your life with results). More advanced exercisers can focus on intensity by adding more weight and more movement.

May I also add that this video will be easy for you to master quickly! Some videos take some time to ""get into the routine"" with the instructor going every which way and you feeling like you're trying hard to follow them around the room or catch up to the move they're on. Not this video! After my first time going through it (granted, I've seen these moves before), I was already in the groove and anticipating the next sequence, especially in the cardio. This is a GOOD thing. The video is not boring, but it moves predictably and comfortably so that within several times you will feel like you've got the video down. I love this because pregnancy is not the time to have to dissect the entire workout just to get it done.

The video I've been doing for 1st Trimester reminds me of TL Webb's Buns of Steel video. If you loved that workout, you will enjoy this one, although this video is less intense and shorter. There are plenty of squats and lunges to provide both lateral and forward/backward movements using your own bodyweight or you can and probably should incorporate hand weights (as you know, with hand weights you can increase the intensity level to your own liking). The focus is on correct body posturing and controlled movements to produce a toning effect. The combination, sequence and speed of the exercises can produce a light cardio effect as well and certainly does for me. You determine how much cardio you get out of it by your own effort. This is what I really enjoy about the video; I am in control of how hard I want to work. If you do the movements haphazardly or sporadically you won't get the intended effect and it will feel ""awkward."" If perform the exercise deliberately concentrating on your muscles and how you are moving and holding yourself up you will get a great workout even without alot of movement. I can't speak to the Yoga segment as I am not familiar with yoga videos, but I do feel energized and relaxed after following up the 30 minute toning section with the 30 minute yoga segment.

My overall sense is that although this video may not be mainstream or highly popular, LB provides a solid, balanced, simplified way to get in a good, regular, prenatal workout at home. The DVD is not overly flashy or updated, but the exercises I believe reflect those that will stand the test of time. Ultimately there are only so many moves out there that produce great results that you can do during pregnancy. This video would be a great addition to your prenatal DVD library or your only program if that is what you choose. I personally am using the LB DVD program as my toning portion of my prenatal exercise, although it can stand complete on its own. For my cardio, I am walking, lightly jogging (I ran a half marathon 3 months before I started this pregnancy) several miles a week, and cycling a few miles a week. But I could easily use LB's DVD's more often and push harder to get the cardio effect as well. I just enjoy the outdoors :) I also have the Summer Sanders DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Sanders-Prenatal-Workout/dp/B001VC995S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout</a>) as a supplement in case I feel like a ""change"" from the LB DVD, which occasionally we all feel like something different.

Overall, I feel great and more fit than when I started this DVD program just 3 weeks ago. I highly recommend it, especially if you have LB's petite, compact, muscular body-type, you will especially enjoy the results!

I've tried a few others that I borrowed from the library/friends, but I've always ended up doing them once and then saying ""nah, I'll go back to Lindsay's instead"".  Here's what I like about it:
~there is a cardio/toning, and a yoga workout.  It's easy to do just one, or to do both.
~timing is perfect - workouts are about 25-30 minutes, which gives me time to do this and something else, like walking.
~there's a separate DVD for each trimester.  I'm only in my second right now so I haven't tried the third, but the first two have both fit very well with what my body feels like it needs and can do.
~Even though Lindsay isn't pregnant in the DVDs, there's two women with her in each DVD that are actually in that trimester.
~lots of modifications: almost all exercises have different intensity levels -- each of the three women in the video will do a different intensity level so you actually can see someone doing whichever method you choose.
~Lindsay focuses a lot of proper form.
~When I skip this video for more than 2 days, I have terrible back pain....but when I'm doing this DVD, I'm back-pain free!  A wonderful thing to discover because back pain has been a big problem for me since early in my pregnancy.  Other DVDs haven't been as successful about making me feel better.

There are a few negatives, but they don't outweigh the positives
~Lindsay can be almost annoyingly upbeat with her comments sometimes (but what DVD workout tape isn't?)
~Once in each workout, there's a time where a text screen is superimposed over the women working out.  You're supposed to keep working out during this time, but without being able to see the people on the screen, it's challenging.
~There's a few spots where the camera will be very zoomed in on a person, and then they change the exercise they're doing.  The camera doesn't zoom out for another minute, so the first couple times you do the video, you're totally lost on what you should be doing.

3025730,3,B000YA4F2K,"If I were rating this DVD set on the cardio and toning alone, I would have given it five stars.  The cardio and toning is great, and very on par with where my energy level is...with some options for the days it's not quite so high.  You do need weights though...which I didn't catch when I ordered so I ordered a cheap set of free weights after I got the DVD.  The YOGA however, is not very relaxing and the music they set it to is actually rather annoying.  I supplemented with element Prenatal and Postnatal Yoga...much better DVD for yoga.",1316563200,,542,4.336633663366337
3025731,1,B000YA4F2K,"I'm going against the grain here, but I really HATE these workouts. I did the first trimester workout a few times, tried the yoga, and just tried the third trimester workout this evening. I find Lindsay really annoying and artificial and got tired of the word ""buncakes"" really quickly. The music is bad, the pregnant moms seem bored and lackluster, and even the workout clothes are ill-fitting and awful.

What is worse though is that my body doesn't feel good when I'm doing the workouts, and I always feel achy (not good post-exercise sore) and bad after I'm done. I don't feel like I've worked particularly hard, but her directions are difficult to follow and some of her workout movements are awkward and have me twisting my knees and hips in strange positions. I stopped using the first trimester workout after I started having contractions after one of them (this probably isn't related, but still, negative associations). After getting a little over halfway through the third trimester workout today, I just had to turn it off. I'm not even sweating, am doing everything she's telling me to do, and now my back is throbbing, a first in this pregnancy. I find her directions counter-intuitive and often perplexing, the the filming doesn't show you what they are doing half of the time so it's hard to follow. Lindsay also keeps kind of a strange tempo that doesn't quite match the tempo of the awful music.

I also tried the yoga once, had to quit that as well. It wasn't so much yoga as a series of stretches. I don't think Lindsay understands what good yoga is, and these sequences seemed like poorly-designed races.

For a prenatal workout DVD, I highly recommend Summer Sander's Prenatal Workout. It works you a little harder, has workouts specific to each trimester, and is paced really well. It has a light-hearted attitude and you will never hear the word ""buncakes,"" thank goodness.

For yoga, I recommend Shiva Rea's Prenatal Practice. The sequences in here are very good and this would be good for beginners to moderate-level yogis. The music and setting are both very relaxing, Shiva's instructions are easy to follow, and you feel like you're both getting a good workout and reducing stress. This practice also focuses on preparing you for labor. I also really like Yoga for Pregnancy with Ann Richmond. Although these are all green-screen workouts, I actually find the lack of a cheaply decorated studio calming and less distracting. Ann provides lots of support and empathy, and this DVD has workouts for each trimester as well as for morning sickness, before bed, and for sciatica/back pain.",1315440000,77,2613,4.878378378378378
3025732,5,B000YA4F2K,"I bought this DVD set when I was at the beginning of my second trimester (now in Third) and it has been wonderful. It has a DVD for each trimester, suited to what you should be doing at that time. On each one is a toning and cardio program (approx 40 mins) and a yoga program (about 25 mins). You can choose to do one or both of the programs to suit your mood, the day or time constraints. The good thing about a DVD per trimester too is that you are not doing the exact same workout for 9 months.

I worked out regularly before I was pregnant and have found the workouts good enough to make me sweat, but also gentle enough that you feel you are not overdoing it. It would be suitable for all fitness levels. I use this DVD about 3 times per week, as I also go to the gym a few times too or go walking. To compliment the toning portion of this program I bought a set of 3 dumbells (3, 5 & 8 lbs) for about $25. I got the Jillian Michaels set at Walmart and it has worked great. You need to have something you can use for weights (one heavier and one lighter set).

I like Lindsay Brinn's manner (i.e. don't find her irritating) so don't mind doing this 3 days a week.

I am looking forward to trying the Bootcamp DVD when I deliver which has lots of 10 mins programs for different things (cardio, abs, toning etc) so you can pick and choose what you do as you may have less time to do anything in one go.

It is so convenient popping in a DVD at home! I highly recommend this DVD. It also arrived quickly so would recommend buying it on Amazon, where I think it was quite a good price.",1314835200,,1586,4.0094936708860756

So for those who are disappointed that this DVD is not intense enough, Brin intended that it be used IN COMBINATION with walking/running/elliptical/etc.  I found that the first trimester workout was a little too short and easy for my taste, by the second trimester workout was just right.  I also enjoyed the fact that she includes a separate yoga practice tailored to each trimester.  The only other criticism that I have is that the set and image quality of the DVDs are a little old-school, but that didn't bother me.",1314662400,,1207,5.908045977011494
3025734,2,B000YA4F2K,"I will continue this review as I go along with the dvds, to make sure I remember everything.

This dvd set has cardio and yoga

Review for the cardio, first trimester dvd:
I am 11 weeks pregnant and just got this today. I work out regularly, running, yoga, fitness.

This dvd is set up in very boring cheap looking background, the music is very very irritating going on and on in short loops with the same fast beat track, I sure hope it changes with the other dvds because I cannot stand listening to it every morning for sure.
I have been doing fitness classes for over 10 years and there is NOTHING new or different in this one, just steps and lifting weight mainly.
Lindsay is not pregnant in this video, there is a pregnant woman Michelle in the background and another girl Lauren. Lauren looks like she is properly bored (don't blame her) but Michelle looks cute and does the moves a pregnant women in first trimester would do. However since Lindsay is the main person in front, not being pregnant - doing exercises you would do if you are not pregnant this does not feel like a dvd for pregnant women (aside from Michelle in the background). Many times Michelle kind of takes a break while Lindsay does harder exercises, which to me does not make sense in a pregnancy dvd.
The only alteration of this cardio making it usable for a pregnant women is the Kegels added to the sit-ups, otherwise this does not differ at all from a regular cardio work out dvd. However I would never follow this if I were not pregnant as it is just way to boring and regular.

To be continued when I do the yoga section tomorrow.
The yoga is not bad, hence the two stars, but I felt it was insufficient as a proper workout on its own. Again poor setup.

Second Trimester:
Cardio 37 minutes
Oh dear, the same very very irritating music, same boooooring workout. Cardio is plain old cardio with step, and choreography that requires you to love step and have a bit coordination. To me this is just way to boring and could have been a video from 10 years ago as there is nothing new. A bit more pregnancy talk though, but I will never ever watch this again as it left me feeling properly bored and irritated.",1313280000,6,2189,4.395061728395062
3025735,5,B000YA4F2K,I have only been doing the first trimester workout so far and love it. I have tried other prenatal workouts and this is the best one out there.

3025736,5,B000YA4F2K,"I wish I had bought this in my first trimester.  I love how there are multiple workouts for each trimester and a bootcamp for after baby.  I know I will use all of them eventually.  When I have baby #2 I will use from beginning.  The instructor is enthusiastic but not spastic like some videos.  The 3rd trimester yoga is very easy in my opinion but probably best for me being in my 8th month.  I'm a runner so it's been hard for me to slow down.  I love that the yoga is only 26 minutes versus the other DVD I had that was 55!  I can do this before or after work and don't sweat (I normally sweat during yoga).  I will give an updated review once I try the other DVDs.  Also, nice that they come in one case so you don't have to search for multiple cases on your shelf.

They are more challenging than other pregnancy DVDs I have tried, and they have modified versions of each exercise in case they are too difficult.  Even though I am in my third trimester, I frequently use the second trimester DVD to get even more of a work-out.  I am not a big fan of yoga (I prefer weight-lifting), but I feel confident knowing all of the video's moves are safe for Baby, and given the health benefits, I make sure to do the third trimester yoga work-out at least once a week.  Even for me, this yoga video isn't imtimidating! I haven't used the fourth DVD yet, but it sounds like it contains varied and effective work-outs aimed at post-pregnancy weight loss.  I highly recommend these videos!",1311379200,,777,4.5285714285714285

3025740,5,B000YA4F2K,"I really enjoy the cardio as well as the yoga. Neither are strenuous or make you feel like your pushing yourself too hard. There are several different impact levels demonstrated during each exercise so if your tired or have more energy you can still follow along at a pace comfortable for you that day. I haven't done any yoga until this pregnancy. I was 23 and in great shape with my first child and now being 38 and still in fairly good shape with my second I can find things to be a bit more challenging, like the sciatic nerve pain I started having early on. As soon as I started doing the yoga the pain subsided and whenever I feel a twinge of it returning I just pop in the yoga portion and it helps so much. The instructor is great! Very informative all through out the videos and cautioning for certain situations in pregnancy. Having the trimester oriented videos is nice too,so your not always doing the same thing. I am very happy with this video set and thanful for all the reviews as well which really help you find what your looking for. :)",1308182400,2,1054,4.355329949238579
3025741,5,B000YA4F2K,I have worked through the 1st trimester cardio/toning and yoga workouts.  They are short enough to make it reasonable and tailored to each trimester.

With my other pregnancies I only walked on my treadmill, but these have toning too!  And afterward, you can actually feel like you got in a good workout.  As with all of Lindsay's videos, there are modifications according to how you feel.  I liked having the yoga section too.  It helped with relaxation as well as flexibility and just overall feeling better while pregnant.  I love the fact that Lindsay has had children so she really understands.  In the video she uses pregnant ladies to do the exercises with her so that makes it nice.  Now at 2.5 mos post-pardum, I'm hitting the boot-camp HARD working to get my body back!  I love the boot-camp 2 dvd and feel like you can workout as hard or easy as you want.  I'm following her 60 day slim down and have lost 7 lbs in 3 weeks (while breastfeeding).  Still have more to go, but with her great DVD's and advice on her blog/website I'm gonna make my goal!  Thanks Lindsay for great DVD's and inspiration.

The yoga was relaxing and the cardio- I liked being able to select the amount of free weights. She also gave great tips on how and why to change certain exercises.

The workouts are right on track -- as soon as I hit the next trimester, the new workout hit all the new areas of my body that needed to be targeted.  After I had my baby, I got right into the Boot Camp video, and it was the perfect way to start building my endurance and strength back.

The cardio and toning segments helped me gain weight in all the right places, while keeping my body toned. The yoga segments were relaxing and helped me maintain my flexibility. I recently had a baby and am now using the bootcamp workout to get back into shape. It is challenging and I think it will do the trick! I would highly recommend this workout series.

Because of that, I wanted the cardio workouts to be a bit more challenging. They are hard, but not as hard as I was used to. I have come to realize that is a good thing, though, because you should not push yourself too hard when you are pregnant. I had to learn that it was ok to tone it down a bit. Lindsay's videos helped  me to realize that. I loved doing the yoga, though again it was not as challenging as I was used to. I still felt the relaxation, which is more important when you are pregnant anyway. I'd heard ""horror stories"" of people having incredibly intense hip pain before their baby came, but I never did, and I believe the yoga was a big part of that. I loved having a good set of workout videos at home, especially after my baby came as I am not OK with leaving my baby at a gym day care while I workout. The postnatal workout is fantastic. I believe the doing the whole program helped me to be back to my normal weight by about 4 or 5 months post-partum. So grateful for Linday's amazing workouts!",1272412800,,1194,4.102564102564102

She's motivating and makes me want to push myself and work hard, and she's always positive and upbeat. I also like that the music is light and not the focus of the DVD. And I like that there are pregnant mothers in different stages throughout the videos.

I love the pregnancy videos that they are split up into trimesters to meet the needs of each stage of pregnancy.(Your body totally changes, so it only makes sense that your workout should too.)

I loved that there was a yoga portion included in this DVD. I like yoga, but was concerned of doing some of the traditional moves in my pregnant state. (I didn't want to injure something:) But these pregnancy specific moves in the second trimester DVD took that worry away.

I also liked that I was able to vary the intensity of the workout based on how I was feeling (some days super, some days not so much:) I was still able to do something, which helped me feel better physically and emotionally.

I recommend these DVD's to all of my pregnant friends, and my copy is currently out on loan to my pregnant running buddy. These videos kept me strong and healthy throughout my last pregnancy, and I look forward to using them again when the time comes.",1270080000,,1370,4.556910569105691

The workout and yoga sessions are seperate, so if you are really beat you can opt for the 20 minute yoga to assure that you are stretching out those tired muscles.

I love the Yoga section too! It has kept me very flexible and I'm even finding improvement in my flexibility! These videos are just challenging enough, but not exhausting at all. I never had morning sickness with my first two pregnancies but have experienced all day sickness with this pregnancy. I was shocked to find that if I could just motivate myself to do the 1st trimester video, I felt SO MUCH BETTER! It was amazing! I never thought that exercising would help with feeling sick in the 1st trimester! I love the post-natal bootcamp too. I had amazing success with it after my second baby... actually, better success than I ever imagined having! (getting back to my weight from when I was a freshman in high school!)

Most prenatal workout videos (I have a lot of them) were too easy for me and I felt like I was not getting anything out of them, but these were safe AND challenging, which was refreshing. Having the workouts broken down by trimester was very helpful, and Lindsay was usually right on with what I was able to do at each point in the pregnancy. The yoga section left a little to be desired for me, so I usually just subbed my own yoga workout for the one on the DVD, but it is probably ok for someone who does not already do yoga regularly and isn't picky.
The postnatal boot camp video is also WONDERFUL. There are tons of different options and workouts to choose from and they are challenging enough to actually help you get back into shape, unlike most other postnatal workouts that I have seen.

I liked that she had alternative moves to do when I felt tired or when I couldn't keep up.  The videos are definitely geared for safe exercising during pregnancy and each video was directed and individualized for each trimester.  I also liked that the videos gave me options between two workout programs and 2 yoga programs.  I liked to switch between them so that I didn't get bored.

To give context, I normally enjoy Jillian Michaels workouts (30 Day shred is in the regular rotation) and I work out five days per week for at least 30 minutes each time.  I found this DVD to be too easy in terms of intensity, just not challenging enough even in pregnancy,  but also a little difficult/complicated to follow as I was working out - the moves didn't seem to be intuitive and the cardio routines transitioned too quickly from move to move to really get into any of them.  I agree with other reviewers that Lindsay herself is a little cloying, but that really wasn't a deal-breaker for me.  I'm sure this would be a fine workout for someone who wasn't working out regularly before, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who was in pretty good shape to begin with.
I also received a DVD copy that was very poorly burned - the picture skipped every few seconds, but the audio seemed intact.  Needless to say, I returned it because it was a defective copy, but I would have returned it anyway - just not for me.",1428278400,,1064,4.403061224489796

I actually could see it being a bit hard for those women who didn't workout regularly before pregnancy, but she has easier modified versions for those who find it too difficult.  I was hesitant to order it at first for I saw a couple bad reviews about graphics covering up instructions and her use of the word buncakes, but I believe they are over exaggerated comments.  There are only two quick graphics which she has already showed you the simple moves, so there is absolutely no problems following the DVD.  She says the word buncakes only a few times.

I am very fit, I biked 6 miles the weekend before my son was born if that tells you anything :o), but I just couldn't follow the routines at all! Part of the problem is that the camera keeps panning away so that you cannot see what the individuals who are leading the exercise program are doing, and then there were rapid transitions, so I was constantly out of step. I am big into cycling and jogging. I also enjoy swimming, yoga and aerobics.

I wish there was more focus on core strengthening but her attention to the upper back muscles has been very beneficial and has noticably helped prevent back pain during my pregnancy. Also her cues for you to activate your back muscles and take the sway out of your back has been a very useful tool in relieving back aches. Good videos all around.,1406160000,,568,4.633663366336633

The only Con- is that if its your only source of exercise ( Like during a bitter winter where you cant leave the house for walks, etc...) then it can get a little boring after several weeks. Change it up a bit with other DVD's or exercise methods to prevent workout boredom.

Best of all, the music is not annoying and Lindsay is unbearably cute.  She's not in your face, she's very calming.  And there are modified exercises for those days when you're moving a bit slower.

The ""yoga"" section is simply a few poses at the end of each DVD that went by so quickly, I wasn't even sure that's what it was.

I was hoping to get an exercise regimen geared for someone who regularly exercises (before and through pregnancy) and this DVD hardly felt like exercise. The cardio portions didn't challenge me at all from a heartrate perspective but the aerobic foot work changed so frequently, it was ineffective, confusing and slightly ridiculous. The toning parts are ok but nothing that most people don't do already (if they use weights). Plus all of the exercises are only completed 1 time. Im currently in my 3rd trimester and wanted to start using pregnancy DVD's to break up my regular routine but this will not be incorporated since it was a total waste of time. I used Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout last week- and though I can tell she may get on my nerves after a while, the workout was much more effective",1381708800,,853,4.809523809523809

Only a few minor complaints about the videos, I wish they continued the end of the yoga section longer so you can really take the time to relax and focus a bit longer, they end quite abruptly. So far I'm only in the 2nd trimester but I look forward to the next section and can hardly wait to start the boot camp once cleared after delivery.",1372464000,,560,4.394230769230769
3260187,4,B000YA4F2K,"I have been doing these DVDs since I first found out I was pregnant (currently halfway through my second trimester) and they have been great. Before pregnancy, I did pretty high-impact workouts like Jillian Michaels, Billy Blanks, and Jackie Warner, so I was concerned with maintaining the same types of workouts, just at a lower intensity. Lindsay's workouts do a good job of challenging me while focusing on each trimester's individual challenges. She gives a lot of commentary on what you may be going through and changes you should be making due to your growing belly, which I like since this is my first pregnancy. She alternates between toning and cardio segments; the toning segments are more challenging to me since the cardio segments are very low-impact and tame. She gives variations to the workouts using her two assistants so if something doesn't feel good to you one day, you can adjust your movements to help rather than harm yourself. Lindsay herself has a very chipper and optimistic personality, and she hasn't gotten on my nerves yet (except for referring to your butt as ""buncakes"") so that's a plus!",1369440000,2,1120,4.931216931216931

3260189,2,B000YA4F2K,"I recently purchased this four DVD set.  It clearly states on the box that prenatal yoga is included.  On the ""before you begin"" section on the second trimester DVD Lindsay herself tells you that on days 1,3, and 5 she wants you to do cardio and toning, and days 2 and 4 she wants you to do yoga and cardio.  There is some yoga at the very end of the workout, but she does not say ""Now we're going to do yoga.""  If you aren't familiar with yoga you wouldn't have any idea where the cardio section ends and the yoga section begins.  Also, half of what she is calling yoga is not even yoga.  You HOLD a pose for yoga.  You don't do reps.  That is NOT yoga.  This is blatant false advertising.

I am familiar with yoga so I was able to pick out what she is claiming is yoga, but there are only SIX MINUTES of yoga on each DVD.  Six minutes!  I bought these DVDs for the yoga, and there is pretty much NO YOGA.  Yoga is not just a cool down.  It's a necessary workout during pregnancy to help increase your flexibility and core strength, and prepare you for labor and delivery. I am not just spouting nonsense--I worked for several years as a labor and delivery nurse.

I am complete unsatisfied with this workout set.  I do not recommend it for any pregnant woman.  You'd be better off getting anything else.",1367193600,,1305,4.218623481781377
3260190,5,B000YA4F2K,"These DVD's take you through each trimester offering safe exercises with different moderation levels for each workout. This was important to me as I always worry about doing something I am not supposed to when I am pregnant. I am a worrier.

Each trimester DVD has a cardio/toning component {which I love} and a prenatal yoga component {which I am coming to like more and more as this pregnancy progresses - I am not a big Yoga person}. I prefer the toning cardio workouts first thing in the morning to kick start my day.

The prenatal 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester DVD's keep you moving at a good pace so you do not feel like you have to pause the DVD in order to keep up with the routine, while the Post Natal Boot Camp DVD moves at a faster pace forcing you to push through.

The Post Natal Boot Camp DVD has a ton of variations - keeping the workout constantly fresh! You can create your own combo or follow the program the DVD has set up {I bought this DVD after I had my first child and followed the program. It was the variation and intensity I needed in order to get back in my pre-pregnancy clothing}.

Lindsay herself is a very upbeat energetic character who I enjoy working out with and listening to. It has made working out fun.

The cardio workouts require weights {2 sets -one light and one heavier} but there are modifications for each workout and if it is too much you are encouraged to go to the lighter weights.

I really liked these DVD's and have used the Post Natal Bootcamp DVD after all of my pregnancies to help me get my body back. I am a big fan of this program and if we have a baby #4 I know that I will use it again. It is not too hard and it is not too easy. It is enjoyable and can be tailored to suit your level of intensity.

I was given a copy of this DVD program for the purposes of a blog review on ""Mom Mart"" and enjoyed it so much that I am sharing my thoughts and opinions here as well.",1367193600,,1923,4.13941018766756

I definately notice a difference when I do these DVD's at least 2-3 times a week in how I feel--less back pain and more energy. I'm now 37 weeks and still doing them twice a week along with walking. I highly recommend!!",1365638400,2,563,4.413461538461538

Exactly what I was looking for, enough to get a decent work out, but I actually have time to complete it. Second the work out is a decent one and does hit all the major muscle groups. So now the downside, I have to completely agree with a prior review, if she says ""buncakes"" one more time I am going to vomit! Seriously? Ok once it might be cute, but she does this over and over without ever using the correct anatomic terminology. Second, she reminds you of how fat you are getting and that she is not, ""Now on myself you will see this nice hollow out action...(of your stomach)..."" OK, I know I will not see it when I am pregnant! I am doing this video to feel better about myself now, not to remind myself what my stomach looked like before I was pregnant! Anyway these are petty, and over all the work out itself is fine. The Yoga, could be better. It is not as relaxing as I would like in so far as I would like some nice music or peaceful ambiance in the back ground, but she just goes through the poses to regular work out music like going through regular stretches, which is ok for the stretching, but I would like something a little extra for the mental health.

Although I pretty munch enjoy doing these exercise programs, I found the background music is just so terrible. It was just music playing the same melody over and over again which at certain point I find it irritating.",1338595200,,561,4.854166666666667
3260207,1,B000YA4F2K,"This is by far the worst prenatal DVD I've done during my pregnancy because the production quality is low, because Lindsay is an awful instructor, and because the actual exercises are ineffective.

There are two basic camera angles, and oftentimes when she is trying to illustrate something (like a sway back) she and one of the pregnant ladies are facing the camera, so you can't actually see the back. Sometimes they are doing a back exercise but the camera is focused on just their bodies. There are also multiple points at which she is transitioning between exercises, but the camera is focused on the ""modifying"" exerciser rather than the instructor so you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing. In the third trimester video in particular, she frequently looks at and gives instructions to the wrong camera.

Lindsay also sometimes says that she is going to do one thing, like push ups, but then goes into a stretch instead. In the third trimester video, she even forgets to do the side plank on the opposite side. It is a travesty that she didn't include Kegels on the third trimester workout.

I enjoyed some of the toning exercises but did not find the cardio to be useful at all. I did everything like she did, but my heart rate went up less than when I take a brisk walk. Like other reviewers, I found her timing to be off with the music.

The two back-up exercisers frequently are frequently off beat, making it distracting. I find it hilarious that Lindsay attempts to sell you the ill-fitting and ugly workout clothes they are wearing.

This video is not for mamas-to-be who are already in good shape! I much prefer the Perfect Pregnancy Workout.",1337731200,6,1668,4.659863945578231
3260208,1,B000YA4F2K,"When I bought this set of DVDs I was looking for something that would really work me out, but also keep in mind that I was pregnant. I was used to doing Jillian Michaels DVDs and wanted something that would kick my butt like that - after reading reviews and looking at several different ""pregnancy work out"" DVDs I decided to try Lindsay Brin since the reviews were generally great, saying it was good cardio etc. - I have to disagree; I could barely get through 1 workout because I was so bored. She's a darling girl and I loved her personality but I was really hoping for something intense and a much faster pace - I haven't tried the yoga, and will for sure since I've been unable to do my regular yoga due to the expanding belly, but the cardio and toning aren't something I'll do again - I just need a little bit more to feel satisfied in my workouts - but that's just me! I know a lot of others have liked it and get a good workout from it!",1335916800,3,946,4.146739130434782
3260209,5,B000YA4F2K,"I've been using the 1st Trimester DVD+Yoga (about 30 minutes each) together several times per week for about 3 weeks now. Since the first time I did the video, I immediately began to see results in my energy levels, toned appearance, flexibility, posture and overall feeling of well-being. I was already my ideal weight when I started the exercise program, and I am now 7 weeks pregnant. I feel refreshed and energized after the video and yet like I got a good workout in for the day (cardio & toning as well as flexibility) in a reasonable amount of time (during my 12 month old's nap!).

The negative critique has been that Lindsay Brin uses the word ""buncakes"" to refer to the glutes. Yes, she does. But if you can get over that/overlook it (which personally if you're in the middle of a workout concentrating on your body movements should be easy to do!), she is fine. The question is, does the use of a local ""slang"" word negate all of Lindsay Brin's exercise fitness competency? No it doesn't. True, I had never heard of her before, this is not a high budget video and the other two girls in the video are probably her friends, but the bottom line is she...
- Reminds you to breathe
- Correctly explains the posture and positioning for each exercise
- Uses common,  not-overly-complicated moves in comfortable sequencing
- Doesn't talk more than necessary to be distracting
- Provides modifications throughout the entire workout (with one girl actually being pregnant in the video) to provide lesser or greater challenges
- Gives plenty of reminders to keep an activated back, drink water, prompts to switch exercises, flows easily from move to move
- Incorporates many popular, favorite exercises seen in other videos but with pregnancy needs in mind
- And best of all, provides a solid, balanced workout that yields results quickly & easily
- Great for beginners wanting to learn some good moves and the more fit looking for a solid workout (YOU determine how hard you want to work)
- And of course, the fact that it is segmented by trimester goes without saying: Convenient!

Several Exercise Examples from 1st Trimester video:
- Squats
- Lunges
- Bicep Curls
- Tricep Over-head Raises
- Dumbbell Bent-Over Raises
- Plank Position
- 8 count Pushups
- Situps

Note: Beginners would do well to master the FORM of each of these exercises (You must hold your body correctly! if you feel awkward, like you're twisting, ect you are probably not in the correct position or you should drop the weights until you have mastered the move! You will not be disappointed once you can do it correctly however. You can do these moves the rest of your life with results). More advanced exercisers can focus on intensity by adding more weight and more movement.

May I also add that this video will be easy for you to master quickly! Some videos take some time to ""get into the routine"" with the instructor going every which way and you feeling like you're trying hard to follow them around the room or catch up to the move they're on. Not this video! After my first time going through it (granted, I've seen these moves before), I was already in the groove and anticipating the next sequence, especially in the cardio. This is a GOOD thing. The video is not boring, but it moves predictably and comfortably so that within several times you will feel like you've got the video down. I love this because pregnancy is not the time to have to dissect the entire workout just to get it done.

The video I've been doing for 1st Trimester reminds me of TL Webb's Buns of Steel video. If you loved that workout, you will enjoy this one, although this video is less intense and shorter. There are plenty of squats and lunges to provide both lateral and forward/backward movements using your own bodyweight or you can and probably should incorporate hand weights (as you know, with hand weights you can increase the intensity level to your own liking). The focus is on correct body posturing and controlled movements to produce a toning effect. The combination, sequence and speed of the exercises can produce a light cardio effect as well and certainly does for me. You determine how much cardio you get out of it by your own effort. This is what I really enjoy about the video; I am in control of how hard I want to work. If you do the movements haphazardly or sporadically you won't get the intended effect and it will feel ""awkward."" If perform the exercise deliberately concentrating on your muscles and how you are moving and holding yourself up you will get a great workout even without alot of movement. I can't speak to the Yoga segment as I am not familiar with yoga videos, but I do feel energized and relaxed after following up the 30 minute toning section with the 30 minute yoga segment.

My overall sense is that although this video may not be mainstream or highly popular, LB provides a solid, balanced, simplified way to get in a good, regular, prenatal workout at home. The DVD is not overly flashy or updated, but the exercises I believe reflect those that will stand the test of time. Ultimately there are only so many moves out there that produce great results that you can do during pregnancy. This video would be a great addition to your prenatal DVD library or your only program if that is what you choose. I personally am using the LB DVD program as my toning portion of my prenatal exercise, although it can stand complete on its own. For my cardio, I am walking, lightly jogging (I ran a half marathon 3 months before I started this pregnancy) several miles a week, and cycling a few miles a week. But I could easily use LB's DVD's more often and push harder to get the cardio effect as well. I just enjoy the outdoors :) I also have the Summer Sanders DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Sanders-Prenatal-Workout/dp/B001VC995S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout</a>) as a supplement in case I feel like a ""change"" from the LB DVD, which occasionally we all feel like something different.

Overall, I feel great and more fit than when I started this DVD program just 3 weeks ago. I highly recommend it, especially if you have LB's petite, compact, muscular body-type, you will especially enjoy the results!

I read all the reviews and wanted something that would really help and this is it.

A small concern of the 1st trimester DVD is it has lots of workout with knee joints. My knees are not strong, so I use lighter danbel rather the heavier one although the DVD suggest to get heavier one for these exercise.

I've tried a few others that I borrowed from the library/friends, but I've always ended up doing them once and then saying ""nah, I'll go back to Lindsay's instead"".  Here's what I like about it:
~there is a cardio/toning, and a yoga workout.  It's easy to do just one, or to do both.
~timing is perfect - workouts are about 25-30 minutes, which gives me time to do this and something else, like walking.
~there's a separate DVD for each trimester.  I'm only in my second right now so I haven't tried the third, but the first two have both fit very well with what my body feels like it needs and can do.
~Even though Lindsay isn't pregnant in the DVDs, there's two women with her in each DVD that are actually in that trimester.
~lots of modifications: almost all exercises have different intensity levels -- each of the three women in the video will do a different intensity level so you actually can see someone doing whichever method you choose.
~Lindsay focuses a lot of proper form.
~When I skip this video for more than 2 days, I have terrible back pain....but when I'm doing this DVD, I'm back-pain free!  A wonderful thing to discover because back pain has been a big problem for me since early in my pregnancy.  Other DVDs haven't been as successful about making me feel better.

There are a few negatives, but they don't outweigh the positives
~Lindsay can be almost annoyingly upbeat with her comments sometimes (but what DVD workout tape isn't?)
~Once in each workout, there's a time where a text screen is superimposed over the women working out.  You're supposed to keep working out during this time, but without being able to see the people on the screen, it's challenging.
~There's a few spots where the camera will be very zoomed in on a person, and then they change the exercise they're doing.  The camera doesn't zoom out for another minute, so the first couple times you do the video, you're totally lost on what you should be doing.

3260228,1,B000YA4F2K,"I'm going against the grain here, but I really HATE these workouts. I did the first trimester workout a few times, tried the yoga, and just tried the third trimester workout this evening. I find Lindsay really annoying and artificial and got tired of the word ""buncakes"" really quickly. The music is bad, the pregnant moms seem bored and lackluster, and even the workout clothes are ill-fitting and awful.

What is worse though is that my body doesn't feel good when I'm doing the workouts, and I always feel achy (not good post-exercise sore) and bad after I'm done. I don't feel like I've worked particularly hard, but her directions are difficult to follow and some of her workout movements are awkward and have me twisting my knees and hips in strange positions. I stopped using the first trimester workout after I started having contractions after one of them (this probably isn't related, but still, negative associations). After getting a little over halfway through the third trimester workout today, I just had to turn it off. I'm not even sweating, am doing everything she's telling me to do, and now my back is throbbing, a first in this pregnancy. I find her directions counter-intuitive and often perplexing, the the filming doesn't show you what they are doing half of the time so it's hard to follow. Lindsay also keeps kind of a strange tempo that doesn't quite match the tempo of the awful music.

I also tried the yoga once, had to quit that as well. It wasn't so much yoga as a series of stretches. I don't think Lindsay understands what good yoga is, and these sequences seemed like poorly-designed races.

For a prenatal workout DVD, I highly recommend Summer Sander's Prenatal Workout. It works you a little harder, has workouts specific to each trimester, and is paced really well. It has a light-hearted attitude and you will never hear the word ""buncakes,"" thank goodness.

For yoga, I recommend Shiva Rea's Prenatal Practice. The sequences in here are very good and this would be good for beginners to moderate-level yogis. The music and setting are both very relaxing, Shiva's instructions are easy to follow, and you feel like you're both getting a good workout and reducing stress. This practice also focuses on preparing you for labor. I also really like Yoga for Pregnancy with Ann Richmond. Although these are all green-screen workouts, I actually find the lack of a cheaply decorated studio calming and less distracting. Ann provides lots of support and empathy, and this DVD has workouts for each trimester as well as for morning sickness, before bed, and for sciatica/back pain.",1315440000,77,2613,4.878378378378378
3260229,5,B000YA4F2K,"I bought this DVD set when I was at the beginning of my second trimester (now in Third) and it has been wonderful. It has a DVD for each trimester, suited to what you should be doing at that time. On each one is a toning and cardio program (approx 40 mins) and a yoga program (about 25 mins). You can choose to do one or both of the programs to suit your mood, the day or time constraints. The good thing about a DVD per trimester too is that you are not doing the exact same workout for 9 months.

I worked out regularly before I was pregnant and have found the workouts good enough to make me sweat, but also gentle enough that you feel you are not overdoing it. It would be suitable for all fitness levels. I use this DVD about 3 times per week, as I also go to the gym a few times too or go walking. To compliment the toning portion of this program I bought a set of 3 dumbells (3, 5 & 8 lbs) for about $25. I got the Jillian Michaels set at Walmart and it has worked great. You need to have something you can use for weights (one heavier and one lighter set).

I like Lindsay Brinn's manner (i.e. don't find her irritating) so don't mind doing this 3 days a week.

I am looking forward to trying the Bootcamp DVD when I deliver which has lots of 10 mins programs for different things (cardio, abs, toning etc) so you can pick and choose what you do as you may have less time to do anything in one go.

3260231,2,B000YA4F2K,"I will continue this review as I go along with the dvds, to make sure I remember everything.

This dvd set has cardio and yoga

Review for the cardio, first trimester dvd:
I am 11 weeks pregnant and just got this today. I work out regularly, running, yoga, fitness.

This dvd is set up in very boring cheap looking background, the music is very very irritating going on and on in short loops with the same fast beat track, I sure hope it changes with the other dvds because I cannot stand listening to it every morning for sure.
I have been doing fitness classes for over 10 years and there is NOTHING new or different in this one, just steps and lifting weight mainly.
Lindsay is not pregnant in this video, there is a pregnant woman Michelle in the background and another girl Lauren. Lauren looks like she is properly bored (don't blame her) but Michelle looks cute and does the moves a pregnant women in first trimester would do. However since Lindsay is the main person in front, not being pregnant - doing exercises you would do if you are not pregnant this does not feel like a dvd for pregnant women (aside from Michelle in the background). Many times Michelle kind of takes a break while Lindsay does harder exercises, which to me does not make sense in a pregnancy dvd.
The only alteration of this cardio making it usable for a pregnant women is the Kegels added to the sit-ups, otherwise this does not differ at all from a regular cardio work out dvd. However I would never follow this if I were not pregnant as it is just way to boring and regular.

To be continued when I do the yoga section tomorrow.
The yoga is not bad, hence the two stars, but I felt it was insufficient as a proper workout on its own. Again poor setup.

Second Trimester:
Cardio 37 minutes
Oh dear, the same very very irritating music, same boooooring workout. Cardio is plain old cardio with step, and choreography that requires you to love step and have a bit coordination. To me this is just way to boring and could have been a video from 10 years ago as there is nothing new. A bit more pregnancy talk though, but I will never ever watch this again as it left me feeling properly bored and irritated.",1313280000,6,2189,4.395061728395062

I know I will use all of them eventually.  When I have baby #2 I will use from beginning.  The instructor is enthusiastic but not spastic like some videos.  The 3rd trimester yoga is very easy in my opinion but probably best for me being in my 8th month.  I'm a runner so it's been hard for me to slow down.  I love that the yoga is only 26 minutes versus the other DVD I had that was 55!  I can do this before or after work and don't sweat (I normally sweat during yoga).

Enjoy! :)",1312416000,,780,3.9741935483870967
3260234,5,B000YA4F2K,"I am in my third trimester, and I use these videos almost daily. They are more challenging than other pregnancy DVDs I have tried, and they have modified versions of each exercise in case they are too difficult.  Even though I am in my third trimester, I frequently use the second trimester DVD to get even more of a work-out.  I am not a big fan of yoga (I prefer weight-lifting), but I feel confident knowing all of the video's moves are safe for Baby, and given the health benefits, I make sure to do the third trimester yoga work-out at least once a week.  Even for me, this yoga video isn't imtimidating! I haven't used the fourth DVD yet, but it sounds like it contains varied and effective work-outs aimed at post-pregnancy weight loss.  I highly recommend these videos!",1311379200,,777,4.5285714285714285
3260235,5,B000YA4F2K,I really enjoy working out to Lindsay Brin's pregnancy workout DVD.  It's fun & it's keeping me fit during pregnancy!  It came in great condition too!,1308787200,,150,4.730769230769231
3260236,5,B000YA4F2K,This set is one of the best workout videos for pregnacy I have found. With each concentrating on each trimester and modifactions to your fitness level you know you will have a safe and healthy workout. The yoga is wonderful too. These workouts prepare you for birth and the bootcamp will help rid you of any baby fat.,1308528000,,317,4.482758620689655
3260237,5,B000YA4F2K,"I really enjoy the cardio as well as the yoga. Neither are strenuous or make you feel like your pushing yourself too hard. There are several different impact levels demonstrated during each exercise so if your tired or have more energy you can still follow along at a pace comfortable for you that day. I haven't done any yoga until this pregnancy. I was 23 and in great shape with my first child and now being 38 and still in fairly good shape with my second I can find things to be a bit more challenging, like the sciatic nerve pain I started having early on. As soon as I started doing the yoga the pain subsided and whenever I feel a twinge of it returning I just pop in the yoga portion and it helps so much. The instructor is great! Very informative all through out the videos and cautioning for certain situations in pregnancy. Having the trimester oriented videos is nice too,so your not always doing the same thing. I am very happy with this video set and thanful for all the reviews as well which really help you find what your looking for. :)",1308182400,2,1054,4.355329949238579
3260238,5,B000YA4F2K,I have worked through the 1st trimester cardio/toning and yoga workouts.  They are short enough to make it reasonable and tailored to each trimester.  I feel energized after doing them.  The 1st Trimester dvd pauses for a second in the middle of the workout but keeps playing.  I'm not sure if this is just my dvd or what... Lindsay Brin is energetic and passionate about mom's getting in shape in a safe manner.,1307923200,,412,4.602739726027397
3260239,5,B000YA4F2K,"I purchased these videos right after finding out I was pregnant w/ #3.  I SOOO wish I would have had them for my other pregnancies.  With my other pregnancies I only walked on my treadmill, but these have toning too!  And afterward, you can actually feel like you got in a good workout.  As with all of Lindsay's videos, there are modifications according to how you feel.  I liked having the yoga section too.  It helped with relaxation as well as flexibility and just overall feeling better while pregnant.  I love the fact that Lindsay has had children so she really understands.  In the video she uses pregnant ladies to do the exercises with her so that makes it nice.  Now at 2.5 mos post-pardum, I'm hitting the boot-camp HARD working to get my body back!  I love the boot-camp 2 dvd and feel like you can workout as hard or easy as you want.  I'm following her 60 day slim down and have lost 7 lbs in 3 weeks (while breastfeeding).  Still have more to go, but with her great DVD's and advice on her blog/website I'm gonna make my goal!  Thanks Lindsay for great DVD's and inspiration.  I own almost all of her DVD's and LOVE them!",1307836800,,1137,4.37799043062201
3260240,5,B000YA4F2K,"With all of the changes in your body, come changes in your workout too. Lindsay is able to keep you motivated to workout on a daily basis during your entire pregnancy. I enjoy working out with DVDs, and this series made it easy to continue with my daily routine. I could choose which workout(s) I wanted for the day- and knew I could get my workout done before work. The yoga was relaxing and the cardio- I liked being able to select the amount of free weights. She also gave great tips on how and why to change certain exercises. Most importantly, the workouts kept my interest- since there were 3 DVDs for the pregnancy...going to begin the post pregnancy workout in the next couple of days- can't wait!",1305417600,,705,4.4728682170542635
3260241,5,B000YA4F2K,"These are the best prenatal workout videos I've found, and I've looked long and hard.  I loved that I could work out, easily, at home, with minimal equipment on my own schedule, AND that each workout was tailored to a specific trimester.  The workouts are right on track -- as soon as I hit the next trimester, the new workout hit all the new areas of my body that needed to be targeted.  After I had my baby, I got right into the Boot Camp video, and it was the perfect way to start building my endurance and strength back.  Plus, when I started the Boot Camp, I could appreciate just how much the prenatal videos had kept me in shape during pregnancy which helped speed the return to my regular clothes much faster than after my first child when I didn't know about Lindsay and these workouts!",1305417600,,795,4.351351351351352
3260242,5,B000YA4F2K,"I absolutely loved these pregnancy workout videos! They were easy to follow, yet they challenged me. They kept me in shape throughout my entire pregnancy. It was nice to not have to worry about what moves were safe to do during each trimester. I was able to rely on Lindsay's expertise to keep me in shape in a fun and safe way. The cardio and toning segments helped me gain weight in all the right places, while keeping my body toned. The yoga segments were relaxing and helped me maintain my flexibility. I recently had a baby and am now using the bootcamp workout to get back into shape. It is challenging and I think it will do the trick! I would highly recommend this workout series. They are very effective and are well worth the time and money. I will definitely be using them again during my next pregnancy.",1305331200,,815,4.44
3260243,5,B000YA4F2K,I used these DVDs daily when I was pregnant!  They are so great and really make you fell great!  I highly recommend this DVD set!,1296518400,,129,4.12
3260244,5,B000YA4F2K,"I used this set with my first preganancy and loved it, and now I am using it again with my second pregnancy. I love to workout and went to the gym everyday before my first baby. Because of that, I wanted the cardio workouts to be a bit more challenging. They are hard, but not as hard as I was used to. I have come to realize that is a good thing, though, because you should not push yourself too hard when you are pregnant. I had to learn that it was ok to tone it down a bit. Lindsay's videos helped  me to realize that. I loved doing the yoga, though again it was not as challenging as I was used to. I still felt the relaxation, which is more important when you are pregnant anyway. I'd heard ""horror stories"" of people having incredibly intense hip pain before their baby came, but I never did, and I believe the yoga was a big part of that. I loved having a good set of workout videos at home, especially after my baby came as I am not OK with leaving my baby at a gym day care while I workout. The postnatal workout is fantastic. I believe the doing the whole program helped me to be back to my normal weight by about 4 or 5 months post-partum. So grateful for Linday's amazing workouts!",1272412800,,1194,4.102564102564102
3260245,5,B000YA4F2K,"I discovered Lindsay's Bootcamp DVD after my first daughter, and was all over her pregnancy DVD's with my second. I really like the tone throughout Lindsay's video's. She's motivating and makes me want to push myself and work hard, and she's always positive and upbeat. I also like that the music is light and not the focus of the DVD. And I like that there are pregnant mothers in different stages throughout the videos.

I love the pregnancy videos that they are split up into trimesters to meet the needs of each stage of pregnancy.(Your body totally changes, so it only makes sense that your workout should too.)

I loved that there was a yoga portion included in this DVD. I like yoga, but was concerned of doing some of the traditional moves in my pregnant state. (I didn't want to injure something:) But these pregnancy specific moves in the second trimester DVD took that worry away.

I also liked that I was able to vary the intensity of the workout based on how I was feeling (some days super, some days not so much:) I was still able to do something, which helped me feel better physically and emotionally.

I recommend these DVD's to all of my pregnant friends, and my copy is currently out on loan to my pregnant running buddy. These videos kept me strong and healthy throughout my last pregnancy, and I look forward to using them again when the time comes.",1270080000,,1370,4.556910569105691
8231731,5,B000YA4F2K,I love this set! The postnatal is great for getting back into the active life and the prenatal workouts are fun! I wish it was more month to month instead of trimesters. My set didn't come with the yoga for whatever reason but I found a giam yoga dvd set that I enjoy. So it all works out.,1517356800,,289,4.0
8231732,1,B000YA4F2K,I wouldn't even give this a one star review. I bought this for my sister who is pregnant and she tried using it and it doesn't work. She was so excited to use them and the DVDs don't even play!!,1486598400,,194,3.875

8231736,3,B000YA4F2K,"Surprisingly unprofessionally done, especially since it seems to come up most frequently for prenatal workouts.
