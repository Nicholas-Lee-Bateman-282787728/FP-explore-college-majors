8201686,3,B000RO8XPS,Good product but would have been great if more about psychology of Dog also had been included in the video set.,1378080000,,111,4.333333333333333
8201687,1,B000RO8XPS,Video just shows the author talking about what he plans to cover - but it's all talk. Better to show a training session to let the customer know if this set is consistent with their own training ideas. Might be a great training video - but you won't know that by watching the trailer...,1293926400,,286,4.314814814814815
8201688,4,B000RO8XPS,"I purchased this dvd set because I wanted some straight forward instructions for basic dog training. This set definitely offers what I was looking for. It is very no-frills, and the video and sound quality could be better, but it's well worth the $24.99 I paid.",1207785600,,261,4.695652173913044
