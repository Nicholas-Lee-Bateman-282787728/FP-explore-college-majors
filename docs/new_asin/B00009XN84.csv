7994033,5,B00009XN84,"I don't believe a skin flick can be like this.  It has a great story and it deals with a great theme of life.  The cinematography is good, and crystal sun,in the title role, is fantastic.  I think the director is not satisfied in this genre, and i will look forward to seeing his name(cary grant)in the mainstream movie.  I highly recomment all of those who interseted in Last Tango in Paris to own this DVD.",1074816000,6,408,4.328947368421052
