Outside the castle walls,Michelle's sister Becky rallies forces to save her sister's soul. Embroiled in this bitter struggle are U.S Embassay Agent Mel Thompson,Lieutenant Marin of the Bucharest Police,and Bob,a CIA agent with a black bag of tricks and a handful silver bullets. With their help,Becky leads the bunch and they all attack the castle.
But when Radu,aided by his grotesque Mummy and the demonic subspecies,Radu turns his love against Becky. The bunch of vampire killers realize that it's not only Michelle's fate that's at stake...but their own. Great cast,music,and story.

7833871,3,6302993245,"Overall a fun watch for fans of the franchise, but it's lost a good bit of the joie de vive that fueled part 2 and made part 1 a breakthrough DTV film.

SIDEBAR:  This was filmed back to back with Subspecies II, which follows in the spirit of the franchise by picking up exactly where this movie ends.

Michelle's sister Becky narrates as this sequel picks up immediately where Subspecies II left off:  After defeating Radu (Anders Hove; Subspecies I-IV, Critters 4), Becky must wait until dark to escape with her vampire sister Michelle (Denice Duff; Subspecies II-IV), who is abducted in the final moments by Radu's ""Mummy"" (Pamela Gordon; Weird Science, Poltergeist II, Subspecies II), a crone-like ghoul akin to an unwrapped mummy.

While not holding a candle to the AMAZING opening scene of Subspecies II, Bloodlust opens with a brief, concerted effort at delivering some gore, wincing wrist slicing and face stabs to get us excited in this sequel's opening.  During this scene, Mummy resurrects Radu and the two of them steal Michelle away because, evidently, Michelle and Radu are to be bound together forever.  That's Radu's idea anyway.

With little contribution from Lt. Marin, Becky and embassy representative Mel continue to try to save Michelle for the entire second act of the movie.  This portion of the story is slow, unexciting, and hardly informative--it just drags.  Meanwhile Mummy whispers poison in Radu's ear in hopes that he'll destroy Michelle instead of weaning her away from her ties to mortality.  Ignoring the classic adage that ""evil witch vampire Mummy knows best,"" Radu teaches Michelle to focus her heightened senses, move through the shadows and hunt human prey.

Normally these vampire tutoring/self-realization scenes are great (e.g., Interview with a Vampire ). But they are just okay and mostly serve to convey Michelle's eventual disgust for this kind of life.

Mummy gets a of screen time and action in this movie--plus a lot of bickering with her son Radu.  Not that I'm not entertained by this, but it made the movie feel less serious and more bonkers, much as the undead Toulon did for Puppet Master II (1991).  To that end, the finale didn't really offer much in the way of action except for Radu's final moments (which was a cool, but brief death).  I find this to be a shame since Subspecies and the first 10 minutes of Subspecies II (in combination) make for a damn fine piece of work making a B+ movie from a B-budget.

As for the story This entire film was about Radu's imaginary romance with Michelle, which was never reciprocated, and Michelle's acclimation to vampirism.  While I understood what the writer/director (Ted Nicolaou) was trying to do, it wasn't done very effectively.  Moreover the subspecies demons, for which this franchise was named, do not even appear until the final few minutes of this film and the bloodstone, for which part 2 was named, played no bigger role in part 2 than in parts 1 or 3.

Part 3 is still overall a fun watch, but it's lost a good bit of the joie de vive that fueled part 2 and made part 1 a breakthrough DTV film.  I'm sorry to say that director Ted Nicolaou (Subspecies I-II, Terror Vision, Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys) lost the inertia that started this franchise so powerfully.",1385856000,,3276,4.824686940966011
7833872,3,6302993245,"Fledgeling vampire Michele has given in to her bloodlust to join Radu in an unholy alliance, but Michele's sister Becky will not allow her to cross over without a fight! BLOODLUST continues the SUBSPECIES vampire saga at its own leisurely pace, retracing many of the same plot points from the previous films but with far less success. It isn't without its moments, however. Michele's first attempt to lure her prey using her new-found powers is highly atmospheric and brilliantly shot using only the most basic editing techniques as effectively as possible. The contrast between Denise Duff's pale beauty and Anders Hove's sinister, rat-like appearance set against their dark surroundings also makes for a number of striking images. Their sexual tension continues to grow as they push and pull away from one another in a game of cat and mouse. Although it takes a step down from the second film, fans of the series are still sure to enjoy this third entry.

7833873,3,6302993245,"Vampires who look like Radu generally aren't very interested in romance, because... well, how many Lestat/Edward fangirls are interested in a guy with a rubber mask face?

But the third Subspecies movie tries pretty hard to whip up a tragic love story subplot for the heretofore-uninterested-in-romance Radu. ""Bloodlust"" does suffer from a rather slow middle section, where nobody seems to be doing much except hanging around spinning their wheels, but it does try to flesh out the characters of Michelle and Radu.

Immediately after the end of the last movie, ""Mummy"" (Pamela Gordon) proves that Michelle (Denise Duff) CAN be useful. Specifically, her blood can resurrect Radu (Anders Hove), bringing him back to life for the second time. Immediately the trio magically flees back to Radu's castle in Transylvania, where Michelle promises to be loyal to Radu if he teaches her the ways of the vampire.

Meanwhile, Becky (Melanie Shatner) freaks out upon discovering that her sister has vanished yet again, and along with the chiseled love interest whose name I have completely forgotten, she begins searching for Michelle's whereabouts. But Michelle is slowly falling into the sway of evil, even as Radu seems to be falling in love with his ""pretty one.""

""Bloodlust"" is mostly composed of Becky and Designated Love Interest sniffing around for Radu, and Radu showing Michelle how to hunt pedestrians, turn into shadows and look longingly at the sunrise. That's it. Not much actually happens in this movie except that, except for brief periods at the beginning and end when things are much, much more more interesting.

Remember how most of Michelle's time in ""Subspecies II: Bloodstone"" was composed of running, crying and standing at clubs? It's sort of like that.

But the slowness is forgivable. Director Ted Nicolaou seems to be focusing more on character development than action. We still have some moments of hilarious B-movie gore (Mummy throws a knife that IMPALES A GUY'S HEAD), but Nicolaou is clearly much more interested in the slow moral slide of the ever-weepy Michelle (""Kill me, Radu"") and Radu's romantic interest in her.

Well, there are some flaws with that. Denise Duff's perpetually weepy acting really doesn't illustrate how Michelle is being tempted to the dark side. And Radu's sudden love for Michelle seems kind of... sudden. However, Anders Hove does an excellent job depicting a monstrous, evil creature who maybe, just maybe, is starting to regret his past actions and feel sad about the emptiness of his life (""Now I have it all... don't I, pretty one?""

""Bloodlust"" is a more character-driven piece than the previous two movies, trying to inject a little depth into Radu's character. Sadly, such cannot be said about ""Subspecies IV""...",1329523200,,2768,5.135555555555555
7833874,5,6302993245,"This series just gets better.  It picks up where SubSpecies 2 left off. Michelle captured once again by Radu and Mummy(his mother.  Her sister  Rebbeca trying her best to free her sister and convince  Sceptics Mel and Merin  that Michelle has fallen pray to a group of Vampires.

Anders Hove,Denice Duff Return  as Radu and Michelle both who give solid performance.

Radu still wanting Michelle has let it be know  he has fallen in love with her and is determined to make her his for all eternity. Michelle still is struggling to fight the vampire part of her and not give into Radu. While her sister fights to free her sister from Radu's grip once and for all.

I highly recmommend this movie if you have not seen the series before then you should get  the first 2 movies before watching this one.

if you like Vampire movies you will like the Subspecies series.",1250553600,,863,4.532467532467533
7833875,5,6302993245,The movie is good. It played really well. For it to be a tape it didn't get foggy of messed up. The price was reasonable but it should have been at least over $3.00. But it was a good buy. I love the subspecies movies.,1246320000,,218,3.8666666666666667
7833876,5,6302993245,"If you are new to the Subspecies series, I strongly suggest that you go back and view the first and second movies before diving into the bloodbath of Bloodlust.  In this third movie, Radu and Michele have already been fleshed out as developed characters, and the beginning of Bloodlust takes off from where Bloodstone left off, allowing for no introduction to the background.
In Bloodstone, we heard Radu tell Michele that ""There is no love between the living and the dead, only hunger.""  Here in Bloodlust, we see that Radu has indeed fallen for the lovely undead Michele, and confesses to love her forever and ever.  Michele, on the other hand, is having a hard time coming to grips with her vampiric self, and though she lustfully drinks from the blood that Radu offers, she vows to hate him forever and ever.
Michele's sister Becky and her new boyfriend Mel have followed the two undead lovebirds back to Radu's castle, where Becky swears to free Michele.  Teamed up with bumbling local detective Marin and Mel's CIA friend who has a bag full of silver bullets and a cheesy beret, they penetrate the castle to rid the town of Radu's evil presence.
What follows is confrontation after confrontation; Radu and Mummy, Radu and Michele, Michele and Becky, until the movie culminates with a wild escape from the castle and the reappearance (briefly) of Radu's miniature gargoyles.
Of all the subspecies movies, Bloodlust is my favorite.  Some secrets are revealed in this installment about Radu's heritage, we see a tender but brief moment with Radu, and there is more humor here than the previous two movies.
Again, if you are a vampire purist and like your vampires nasty, then you are going to love the Subspecies series.  Enjoy!",1089244800,5,1731,4.831081081081081
7833877,5,6302993245,"I went thru alot of trouble to get this video. It has Radu admitting he loves Michelle.(Romance) Radu feeling bad about killing his whole bloodline. (Remorse) Again the music was great and the location shots put you right there in the picture.
The make-up on Radu needs work! Anders Hove (Radu) is a great actor in the vampire role. We need more of this series!",1072483200,,361,4.569230769230769
7833878,4,6302993245,"A must see film from Full Moon Pictures.  This is a story about a Vampire Radu who is trying to take a fledgling vampire named Michelle under his wings while trying to drive the remaining humanity in her out.  All the while Michelle fights to keep her humanity with the aid of her sister Rebecca.  And to ward off Radu.  Along with trying to take the ""Bloodstone"",  which is an ancient relic that gives blood to any vampire who drinks from it so they would be able to live with out taking human life.  This is the 3rd movie in a 4 movie series which is a continuation of the pervious 2 movies and runs through the 4th and final film of the series.  A must see to all people who wish to see a good horror movie and series. But a movie that definately isn't for younger children.",1067385600,,777,4.174496644295302
7833879,3,6302993245,"This third installment in the Subspecies series is one of the better ones.  As in the first two movies, the vampire Radu is trying to seduce his ""fledgling"" Michelle into his world.  At the same time, Michelle's sister enlists the help of the local authorities to try to take Michelle from Radu's home.  The movie is as comic-book like as its predecessors and at the end we once again think Radu has been vanquished as Michelle's sister races away from Radu's castle with her sister safely concealed from the sun in a body bag.  You can move on to Subspecies 4 to see what happens next.  I'd recommend this or any of the Subspecies films for diehard fans only.",1028160000,,660,4.512605042016807
7833880,3,6302993245,"Last time in ""Bloodstone: Subspecies III"" it was a search for Michelle and the bloodstone as good and evil battle for control of a neutral character, Michelle Morgan, bitten by a good vampire Stefan, and an evil vampire Radu, is the central character. Radu now has Michelle inside his castle and he is teaching her the ways of the vampire and meanwhile, Michelle's sister Becky continues her battle for Michelle with the help of the American Embassy Worker and Lietunant Marin. When it comes down to the final showdown, Becky and her friends realize its not just Michelle's fate that is at stake, but their own as well. It all comes down to Michelle's final decesion, go with her sister and try to live a human life although she is a vampire and escape Radu's clutches, or obey what Radu says and let the bloodbath begin and slaughter Becky and her friends, what choice will she make, and what will the consequences be, and what will become of the Bloodstone, the most valuable artifact in the vampire world. The same cast from part II has returned and we pick up right where we left off, Anders Hove is still great as Radu, you'd belive they guy was really a vampire. Still these movies are just fun to watch, not much for scares, just fun movies to watch, the shadow effects are pretty cool in this movie and the blood and gore effects are also quite good, more actual killing in this one then in the last, the last movie was the build up, now, get ready for the blood bath. This was originally going to be the last in the series but there was another sequel made because of the remarkable amount of fan mail, so be sure to go on and view ""Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm.""",1013212800,,1669,4.457516339869281
