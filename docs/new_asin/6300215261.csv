267253,4,6300215261,"Lots of people have already said many things that I agree with. However, I really enjoyed Behrens' acting, singing and total commitment to the role of Tosca. She really pushes herself to the limit vocally, but it adds some real spice to the production. Domingo is great too, however MacNeill is at the end of his career and doesn't sound great. The sets, costumes and direction is superb, in all a fabulous production, except for the clapping by the audience when the curtain rises and also singers make  their entrances.",994032000,4,521,4.788888888888889
267254,4,6300215261,"Unlike some, I wasn't thrilled with the sound quality of this DVD, but it is a solid performance in every way -- outstanding in a few ways.
The outstanding:  Domingo -- in fine voice, and very much looking the part of Cavaradossi; the conducting by Sinopoli -- truly dramatic and intense leadership; the Zeffirelli sets -- deluxe to the nth degree.
The solid:  Behrens as Tosca -- vocally powerful, but dramatically somewhat stiff; MacNeil -- wonderfully oily as Scarpia, a distinctive interpretation, but past his prime and rather weak of voice (esp. by comparison with Domingo & Behrens).
Although the audience was a little clap-happy, applauding even for the singers' entrances (before they'd sung a word), I found myself getting into the performance with the audience.  On the whole, a very good DVD -- your best bet for this opera.",980899200,15,836,4.957142857142857
267255,5,6300215261,"There are three great aspects to this opera: Domingo, who's the best Cavaradossi there can be; Giuseppe Sinopoli, who gives an incredible understanding of the opera and makes you want to cry with his conducting; and Zeffirelli, who makes a richly detailed background as few others.
Its true that Hildegard Behrens and Cornell MacNeil are not the best Tosca and Scarpia there can be, but they do get a great deal out of their characters and are OK.
But even so, this production is great, and the recording is excellent, giving you a shining sound as I have seen on no other DVD yet. A minor drawback is the lack of other DVD features and that there are just english subtitles.
Still, its great, and I highly recommend it.",978480000,9,720,4.589147286821706
267256,2,6300215261,"The main attraction of this DVD is the chance you don't get these days - to see Domingo not on vocal autopilot. Behrens may not be Tebaldi but she was a fine actress and Tosca gave her a chance to shine. The problem is MacNeil's vocally threadbare Scarpia. By this stage his ""singing"" was simply terrible (pitch problems, dry sound, no legato phrasing). Several other baritones would have been a far better choice but, then, most Met ""old timers"" know that backstage politics has far more to do with casting than talent. A better choice is the Kabaivanska/Domingo/Milnes video. Wait for it to come to DVD.",969580800,18,605,4.716981132075472
267257,4,6300215261,"Behrens sings the part and acts the part well enough.  She just doesn't look the part.  For one thing, at this stage of her career she was just too  old to play Tosca; at least, not in a production to be filmed.  From my  cheap seats in the balcony it might not have been so bad, but with all  these close-ups it's very distracting.  That's the only problem with this  marvelous production of my favorite opera, but it's a bad one.  Cornell  MacNeil is a wonderfuly despicable Scarpia, and as with most productions, a  well-played villain is the key. Conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli is masterful,  and Placido's Cavaradossi rivals (I stress rivals) that of Pavarotti in his  youth.  Overall, magnifico, if you can get past a Tosca with cellulite.",967593600,14,742,4.6953125
267258,3,6300215261,"I have to confess to having very mixed feelings about this release, which judging by all the reviews I have read is not the general consensus of opinion.  Still never mind - it would be a boring world indeed if we all  agreed about everything. I have seen this production at Covent Garden (with  the same diva as here - except at the performance I was at she was booed at  her curtain call.  Not by me I hasten to add).  But even at Covent Garden I  felt she wasn't right for Tosca - and here I still feel the same.  I agree  with the reviews that she is a regal Tosca, and acts well, but for me she  doesn't get under the skin of the role.  Watch Callas or Marton and you  will see what I mean.  Now, watch or listen to her singing Elektra or  Brunnhilde and you can see her in a fach totally suited to this great  singing actress - but for me not Tosca. Domingo is great in the role,  totally convincing and giving his usual excellent performance - but I am  afraid that no one can sing Cavarodossi for me like Pavarotti. I saw Sam  Ramey as Scarpia at Covent Garden and he was just perfection personified.  The production is perfect - the attention to detail takes your breath away,  and lets face it, this is an excellent DVD.  But, and for me it is a big  but, it just lacks that final touch.  A shame, but not quite right.  However, before my review influences your decision, just remember everyone  else seems to love it.  How subjective reviews are!",964051200,37,1457,4.207272727272727
267259,4,6300215261,"I don't share other's enthusiasm for MacNeil's Scarpia. He looks like a benevolent Grandpa! Now if you've ever seen Gobbi play this part you know what evil looks like! The star of the show is Franco Zeffirelli. I saw this  production at Covent Garden and the sets are breathtaking, particularly of  Act 1. The video conveys this very well indeed. Domingo is of course superb  and Behrens is in fine voice. I'd be nervous about kissing a girl with  those top teeth though! Her Vissi d'arte is lovely, but, unlike Domingo,  she can't act for toffee. It's a great evening's entertainment and I  recommend it.",939686400,16,605,4.714285714285714

The male singers (Domingo in his prime and MacNeil appropriately sinister) also acquit themselves well.  This a one of the 'epic'  Zefferelli Metropolitan productions, with the accent on spectacle and 'authenticity' which often reduced the scale of the singers during live performances.  On video, however, the use of the close up camera work ameliorates much of that issue.  All in all and enjoyable performance of a favorite.",1359417600,2,515,5.2317073170731705
267343,5,6300215261,"I will admit that I've heard some better Toscas than that sung here by Hildegard Behrens, but I love her passionate acting and the singing is pretty good, if occasionally uneven.  Placido Domingo was in his very long peak of singing ability at this time (1985).  Cornell MacNeil was a wonder as the evil Scarpia.  Add all that to the marvelous production created by Zeffirelli and the exquisite singing/acting by those in small roles, AND the wonderful Met Orchestra, and you have near perfection in this version of Tosca.
  (It was very distressing so see and hear (in person, twice) the more recent production of Tosca at the Met in 2009 and 2010.  The sets were a mess, the stage direction was positively disrespectful to what the composer and librettist had intended.  Ugh.)
  When I recently watched this DVD of the 1985 production with the above wonderful cast, I realized with sadness what the Met has stupidly given up.  But, thankfully, we have it still, on video.  The direction for television, by the way, is also excellent.
  I have watched this performance many, many times.  Puccini's wonderful Tosca does not get any better, when it comes to video productions.",1303948800,3,1175,4.839195979899498
267344,3,6300215261,"I recently watched the tape of the new Met ""Tosca."" For the most part, it was highly criticized due to
the controversial production.  But within minutes of the leading lady's entrance, I was immediately
reminded of the sound of Hildegard Behrens in this staging of Puccini's masterpiece featuring
Franco Zeffirelli's lavish production (which was so much better than the recent Bondy fiasco.) Mattila's
voice, like Behrens', seemed all over the place.  Too many notes seemed fluttery and without a center.
And I love both of these great sopranos!  Mattila, currently one of the world's great sopranos, was
tremendous as the lead in Beethoven's ""Fidelio,"" one of the best Leonores I've ever heard.  (And I
grew up with Christa Ludwig's.)  But she's just not right for Puccini.
  And I'm afraid the same is true with the recently deceased Hildegard Behrens, a soprano that I
adored.  Not endowed with a powerful voice, she nonetheless conquered very difficult roles like
Wagner's Brunnhilde and Strauss' Salome.  I will never forget her Met ""Elektra."" (Which should be
on DVD.)  Unlike most Elektras (including possibly the greatest, Birgit Nilsson) she brought a
likability and femininity to a role that often comes across as a monstrous lunatic.  But vocally
she is just not right for Tosca. The first time I watched this otherwise fine performance, it was
actually painful for me to hear the sound of one of my favorite sopranos.  It is interesting that
sopranos like the two I have written about can thrive in what are considered the heaviest roles
ever written (mostly Wagner) but can't produce the right notes for a part written by a (great) Italian.
Behrens tries very hard here, but I'm afraid it is all in vain.
  Everything else here is fine.  I have the Kabaivanska/Domingo/Milnes ""Tosca"" DVD, which
many consider the best available.  Domingo is fine (but chubby) in this 1976 film but he is even
better here at the Met.  I cannot imagine a better Mario - close to perfection.  Cornell MacNeil
is a complete pro and I like his Scarpia.  Sure he is a veteran past his prime vocally, but I
think he sounds quite good and his acting is excellent.  It is nice to have a performance by the
great bass Italo Tajo preserved, although his Sacristan is a bit of a caricature.  Sinopoli conducts
an idiomatic performance and as usual the Met orchestra is first rate.  And if you like Franco
Zeffirelli, this is one of his most magnificent creations.
  Most of the reviewers here seem to like Behrens' Tosca.  I wish I could.  I hate to say it,
but she ruins this otherwise excellent ""Tosca.""  And she was the most wonderful artist.",1261699200,3,2629,4.823266219239374
267345,5,6300215261,"I have owned this Version for a few years now and play it quite frequently...this Tosca will NEVER be surpassed!  I totally agree with all the praise given it by most of all the other reviewers.  You don't need me to now tell you how fantastic it is.  But I am adding my two cents (for whatever it's worth) now because of that horrendous NEW production which just opened at the MET.  Do modern Directors even bother reading the Composer's Libretto?  Now, I have not seen this new  production yet.  I have read countless reviews of the Opening Night performance, spoken with friends in New York who have seen it and listened to it on the Met Sirius Radio.  I was not impressed with the singing at all.  Obviously I have to go with what the press and friends said about the physical production...the booing for the director and his ""creative"" team was loud and sustained.  It seems that the Met is doing away with all things Zeffirelli for more ""modern"" approaches to its productions.  What a shame!  I'm sure that this new version will eventually come to our PBS stations as a MET HD LIVE performance.  You may want to watch it but have THIS marvelous Domingo, Behrens, MacNeil, Zeffirelli production on hand to see what  the great Puccini really had in mind.  If after I do see it on PBS and have any corrections or new feelings about the new production, I will certainly edit this review.  UPDATE ON JANUARY 20, 2010...I have seen the new production on PBS...what an insulting mess!!!  But I have some good news...the Met has recently announced that it is thinking about REVIVING the Zeffirelli production (it was never destroyed) for the 2010-2011 Season.  It appears that everyone (including the New York Times) is now saying that the new production is a dismal failure.",1254614400,3,1773,4.646302250803859

267347,5,6300215261,"Wonderful!  All this talk of bad acting, poor voices, unintelligent casting is some reviewers' attempt to make themselves feel important.  It's opera, and it's Puccini, so forgiving larger-than-life gestures, scenery, and emotions is not only easy to do, but necessary.  All three leads embody their characters well, and in the opera house, it must have been magnificent.

267348,5,6300215261,"Tosca was the first opera I ever saw, in 1964, from the last row of the topmost balcony of the Rome Opera. I went expecting not to be impressed, feeling a twenty-something surliness toward ""bourgeois"" art. Fortunately, it was a grand production, though I can't remember who sang or conducted, and I've loved opera ferociously ever since. I was living at the time in an apartment just outside the Campo dei Fiori, with a close-up view out my window of the great domed church of San Andrea, where the first act of Tosca unfolds. The opera stage was a near-perfect recreation of that church, where I often sat and thought. I'd never seen such stagecraft before, and the recollection of its impact makes me think that opera should always maintain its tradition of visual magnificence, if only to dazzle the neophyte.
I've kept that apartment for nearly forty years now, and being there for a few days, I watched this Tosca. How could I give it less than five stars, when it seems so true to what I saw first? I have to agree with the review by ""fiordiligi"" that Behrens isn't Tosca, however well she sings. Domingo is almost too forceful for Cavaradossi, that eternal wuss in revolutionary plumage, but who can complain about such vocal command? The character who makes Tosca, however, is Scarpia, a villain so odious one anticipates his destruction gleefully even after seeing the opera many times. It's the villains who make melodrama appealing; the heroes are always mawkish or wispy, and the heroines are never quite fully human. Cornell MacNeil is superb as Scarpia, both vocally and visually. He's not much of a physical actor, I suppose, but the skillful use of camera close-ups reveals his face to be a mobile mask of hatefulness. The cinematography of this DVD is so good that I have to place it on a par with the singing. If you can't afford time-travel to Rome in 1964, I'd say this is at least a fine evening's consolation.",1194393600,12,1931,4.699115044247788
267349,3,6300215261,"If you are female and looking for a production of TOSCA, look no further. Placido Domingo is at his peak here. He looks marvellous, acts beautifully and his singing is beyond superlatives. I am not even going to try. Ladies, after watching this, I went to bed and dreamt of Mario Cavaradossi and how I would NEVER have put him in danger!

Before I get to the opera itself there are two marvellous extras on this DVD - THANK YOU, DEUTSCHE GRAMMAPHON. In one Franco Zeffirelli takes you on a tour of the three Roman locations of the opera and discusses his view on the relationships between the three main characters. The other is an interview with Ms. Behrens, Mr. Domingo (drool) and Mr. Macneil.

I am at a loss to understand complaints that Ms. Behrens looks too old. She is not supposed to be a movie actress but an opera singer. How many very young opera stars are there? Anyway, why can't Cavaradossi fall in love with a woman older than he is?

That said, the perfect Tosca would be perfectly balanced between the three main characters. Here, Mr. Domingo is just so much better than the other two that the production is out of kilter. Mr. Zeffirelli explains that he sees Scarpia as a dangerously attractive man, and that Tosca is attracted despite herself. In killing him, she is striking out at that unwelcome attraction as well.

That sounds great, but neither Mr. Macneil nor Ms. Behrens can bring it off. Scarpia comes off as real nasty, though Mr. Macneil's singing, and his acting in the death scene are tremendous. He is particularly good at the end of Act I, where his positively blasphemous thoughts are expressed against the choral backdrop of the Te Deum. Ms. Behren's voice came across too thin, to me, except in ""vissi d'arte"". She was excellent in Act III.

The sets and staging are gorgeous. That alone makes the opera worth buying.",1189728000,7,1854,4.623100303951368
267390,5,6300215261,"Act I, the chapel scene as designed by Zeffirelli and executed by some very talented artist will never, in my opinion, be matched by other designers.  It is truly a masterpiece, so good, in fact, that at the end of the act, the curtain closes, only to reopen for the most fabulous tableau ever!  While the rest of the sets are grand, this Act I makes this DVD a valuable asset to any designer seeking inspiration, no matter the size of their working stage.",1183766400,3,456,4.416666666666667
267391,5,6300215261,"""Tosca"" is a great introduction to opera, and this DVD is a wonderful introduction to ""Tosca"".

The best features of this particular production are Zeffrelli's staging and camera direction and, of course, the wonderful Cavaradossi that Domingo gives us.

Of course, there are a few problems, too, as has been mentioned by others. Most notable among them, for me, was Hildegard Behrens. Her voice, though not particularly Italianate, was lovely. But a great Tosca needs a great actress and in this role Ms. Behrens' acting was not equal to the task.

Foremost among her problems was that she did not seem to have the slightest bit of chemistry with Domingo. He gave her a passionate, fully committed Mario to play against and yet...she barely looked at him in their scenes. Couldn't someone have reminded her that she is passionately in love with this man? That is essential to the characterization and the plot.

Instead, she played Tosca as somewhat naive, not terribly bright, and lacking in the charisma needed to convey a great star. Naive could have worked, but a great star needs charisma and a great love needs passion. Domingo brings these in spades, but unfortunately got very little from Behrens in response. (On the positive side, at least she doesn't give it the ""silent movie melodrama"" approach.)

On-stage passion is so easy to fake that I'm surprised she seems to be making no effort at all--pulling away from Mario when she should be leaning into him, rarely looking at her lover. A flaw--but with all the other strengths of this production--fortunately not a fatal one.

So...why 5 stars? Because, although Behrens' acting problem prevents it from being definitive, it is still dramatically, vocally, and filmically a wonderful production.",1181433600,6,1757,5.041379310344827
267392,4,6300215261,"It's unfortunate, and really really superficial, but the visual close ups on this DVD have exposed perhaps the greatest weakness in this production of Tosca.. Behrens is simply too over the hill to do this role any justice.. She's got a voice.. that she does.. and from a birds eye view in the bleachers of the Met, this may not make a world of difference.. but on the DVD, it does.. and Behrens is simply not convincing both from an acting standpoint and visual standpoint.. (her costume looks way out of wack and her hair looks pretty bad.. she just looks uncomfortable the entire time up there as if she knows that there's something wrong..)

On the other hand, Domingo is totally a hoot as Cavaradossi giving us one spectacular performance after another.. (he too was in his 40s when this opera went into production but unlike Behrens, Domingo is convincing!)

In the end, once again, it's Domingo's brilliant versatility that shines through.. what an incredible musician..!! (the pit is tight as well.. conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli looks like he worked them to death..)

Although Cornell Macneil (Scarpia) has lost some resonance, his incredible acting really makes up for it!!!

This production is worth getting just to see Domingo (a bit past his prime perhaps but one would never ever know it!!!) He's just a superstar..
there's nothing else to say..",1176076800,2,1357,4.886956521739131
267393,5,6300215261,"I owned this production on VHS and am glad that DG have re-released this with DTS sound. I have always enjoyed watching this DVD, even though it does have a few shortcomings. The most obvious one is the casting of Cornell McNeil as Scarpia, as vocally he falls short, but he makes up for it with his intense acting. Behrens too falls short, but I enjoyed her vocalism and characterisation. There will be too many comparisons to past interpretators of the role, and her voice may not be Italianate enough, but in my books, it works and she is wonderful as the heroine! Domingo is the star of this show! Zefferelli's set is masterfully done and the production is sumptous for the MET stage.",1158710400,2,688,4.556451612903226
267394,4,6300215261,"This was the second time I have seen Tosca and, frankly, the staging was so much better than the movie-version with Gheorgiu and Alagna that I could forgive alot.

Domingo and Behrens sing Cavaradossi and Tosca. There is absolutely no statement fitting to describe Domingo's performance. His ""Amaro sol per te m'era il morire""(I think thats what its called), sung just before Tosca comes to the dungeon, was extremely well-sung and acted. Domingo was by far the best actor of this period, and he shows that fully in his noble performance of Mario.

Pavarotti could probably have sung it ""purer"", but no one could match Domingo's passion and sorrow.

Extremely well-done.

Sinopoli, to my mind was fabulous, although he did get ahead of the singers at times.

Behrens and MacNeil however, were not as good, although defintely tolerable--and even enjoyable. Macneil had an imposing presence as Scarpia, but his voice was tinny and not particularly powerful. Behrens was fabulous in Act 1, but the second part of Act 2 and Act 3, her voice gave out horribly.

However, her acting was amazing. Although she was obviously much older than Floria, she made you believe in her. It was incredible. I had started the opera reluctantly, really only watching it because of Domingo.

I was stunned by how she made you forget her appearance and see the dark-haired actress.

This was a great production, and I will probably be watching it as much as possible.",1156723200,3,1445,4.89344262295082
267395,5,6300215261,"Which Tosca is the greatest will always be a matter of personal taste and or popularity. It seems many simply eat up the 1975 film starring Placido Domingo, Raina Kabaivanska and Sherill Milnes, while for a recording everyone adores the incomparable 1950's record starring none other than Maria Callas, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Titto Gobbi. This 1984 Metropolitan Opera production is not that bad, despite a few flaws that really can be overlooked when you consider the good things about this performance. To get rid of all the negativity that this performance has probably already suffered, let's first discuss the downside of this performance. For a 1984 production, this Tosca does not seem new or fresh,and therefore not powerful enough ultimately but rather a repetition of the classic versions most people are familiar with, though the fault lies in that director Franco Zefferelli, who designed the set and artwork, simply attempted to imitate the lost magic of his first encounter with Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi back in 1964, which marked the last time Callas sang at the Met and the last time she ever sang Tosca. The singers each have their shining moments, but also their unmistakable flaws. A lot has already been said about the miscast Hildegard Behrens in the eponymous role. Of course, a Callas she is not, but nor does she evoke the grand divas of the past that made Tosca a thrilling and great role- Renata Tebaldi, Leontyne Price, Montserrat Caballe, Mirelal Freni, Katia Ricciarelli or Renata Scotto. While these ladies sang with full Italian fire, Behrens is, like one review states, closer to sounding like the Swedish Wagnerian soprano Birgit Nilsson, who also sang Tosca in her own career. Behrens has a light voice despite her attempt to make it seem bigger than it actually is. She is often screaming rather than singing. She fails to impress in the first and last act though her performance in the second act- Scarpia's Farnese Palace..in the infamous scene when she stabs Scarpia after enduring watching her lover Mario being tortured - is absolutely brilliant. No other soprano can match her strength in the lines ""Muori Danato Muuro..Muori! Die Damned One Die! With a particularly strong accent on the last Muori which sends Scarpia to his death! Domingo is in fine shape and there is very little to criticize about his performance. He perfectly captures the character vocally and dramatically. Placido Domingo has had a lot of experience singing the role of Mario both on record and on film. He has sung the role opposite Kabaivanska, Leontyne Price and Mirella Freni, all great performances. Domingo is the equal to Franco Corelli in many ways in that he subdues any macho bravura that Pavoratti or Mario del Monaco may give to the role. He is more the artist/idealist than simply the tenor hero. He does get the role more than any other tenor does. However, I do enjoy Jose Carreras in the role and find him equally as impressive. Cornell McNeill is singing in a very experienced voice, and he oozes evil, and has fine moments, but his performance seems very very rehearsed. However, even despite this, he is still the best Scarpia to my knowledge. Other Scarpias I enjoy on record are Justino Diaz, Ruggero Raimondi and Samuel Ramey. Cornell Mcneil is in his element as Scarpia, from the beginning when he emerges in a dark cape ""Un tal bachiano in Chiesa!"" and when he shouts ""Tosca you make me forget God"" and when he proposes that Tosca sell her body to him in order to save Mario.

The really impressive asepcts of this Tosca is the art direction by none other than film director Franco Zefferelli who has had a life long love affair with opera. In Italian-born man, raised loving opera, once a friend of Callas, director of such films as The Taming of the Shrew with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Romeo and Juliet from 1968, Hamlet with Mel Gibson in 1991 and other fine films, he is experienced in providing a story with as much authenticity as he can muster. On This DVD, a featurette is included that has Zefferelli roaming through Rome in search of the spots that are integral to Tosca -  the Church of the San Andrea De La Valle in Act 1, whose gorgeous interior he recreates in the backdrop (complete with apricot, golden light coming from the arched windows)- the Te Deum scene is of course magnificent. The Palace Farnese is not as pretty as I thought it would be from the inside I must say. It seems that all Zefferelli did was imitate the same set he used for the 60's version with Callas. Poor Zefrelli, it seems all his life he attempted to find a singer most like Callas. If only Teresa Stratas had sung Tosca. She most resembled and sang like Callas but never performed Tosca. Hildegard Behrens is simply inadequate as the definative Tosca. The Castel San Angelo is lovingly recreated. All in all, a fine stage version.",1127088000,8,4879,4.779620853080568
267396,5,6300215261,This dvd is worth buying merely for the beautiful setting of the third act.  Zeffirelli's vision of the third act is so touching with the prison under ground and soldiers walking on the top.  Domingo is very sorrowful and convincing but Behrens is stuck somewhere between verismo and belcanto (as always).  Some believe that she is not good for Wagnerian operas either.  But please bear in mind that after all she is an opera singer and as C.E. Bach once said opera singers know music more than any one else so it is not appropriate for me (or even conductors) to be scrupulous with her.  Met productions are often very beautiful in stage designing and they almost never have any sound technical problems so if you like the cast then you should buy this dvd.,1120608000,5,758,4.5851851851851855
267397,5,6300215261,"I also felt that Behrens was wrong for the part of Tosca, her voice was too heavy, I believe she is a Wagnerian singer (I'm not sure, I hate Wagner); however once I got into the thing I loved her and everything else about this production.  Domingo was breathtaking.  I don't know how I feel about a suave Scarpia, I think I prefer a more brutal one, I think the suavity clashes with what he's saying and planning to do.  The 2nd act which has only one tune in it was for me a little boring as usual, but the drama and excitement were intense (which I guess is a contradiction).  I had a wonderful time watching and listening to this DVD, and except for Behrens' voice would highly recommend it without reservation.  The crowd went wild at everything, even applauding the scenery which was also wonderful and, in this day of the modern approach, a pleasure and a relief.  Only one other quibble, and that was the conductor.  I thought he hammed up his conducting and looked embarrassingly foolish. I wouldn't mention it except it bugged me.",1104278400,2,1039,4.49468085106383
267398,5,6300215261,"Hildegard Behrens was the controversial choice for this Tosca - which delighted, frustrated and infuriated opera goers then - and still does.  Opinions are almost nowhere near the middle on this - you either love this or you HATE it.  I LOVE it.

Behrens sinks her teeth into as sensual a Tosca as one is ever likely to see . . . she's flirty and almost funny in Act 1 and develops a fully integrated character. Her desperation in the rape/murder scene, her earlier revulsions, rage and remorse are palpable.  While the voice is not, admittedly, ""Italianate"" she still has the necessary Italian sense of ""morbidezza"" - and the even the catches in her throat humanize this Tosca.

Zeffirelli picture perfect recreation of Puccini's three acts that is without a doubt one of the best things he's given us.

Domingo is heroic (if not always in best voice) and McNeil's hamminess is effective in an over-the-top (if not particularly sensual) Scarpia.

Sinapoli, despite bad press and some tough times with the Met band, gives a taut, dramatic reading.

Again, Behrens gives her all - her suicide leap is breathtaking - instead of a Tosca jumping off to her death, Behrens's Tosca actually jumps UP - almost as if she expected to meet Scarpia before God right then . . . and then ""swoosh"" down she falls . . . it's chilling!",1098662400,10,1319,4.67965367965368
267459,4,6300215261,"It is dumbfounding that many reviews of this Tosca concentrate on Ms. Behrens' appearance in lieu of the overall production.  Not only is this catty, it smacks of sexism (E.g. I would be surprised if those who commented on her age would make similarly cheap attacks at having to suspend reality and watch a titanic Pavarotti perform an allegedly starving Rodolfo).

That being said, Behrens' Tosca is vocally compelling and dramatically quite appealing.  Domingo's Cavaradossi is the finest on DVD (on par with his filmed performance of the role with Kabaivanska).  MacNeil is good, although a bit of a ham (which is a risk of filming live performances, as gestures intended for a large theatre are exaggerated when seen up-close).

Sinopoli masterly leads the strong Met orchestra.  Although many professional critics dismiss Zeffirielli productions as over-the-top and sentimental, this video attests to why most audiences love his stagings as representing the true spirit of dramatic opera.",1095724800,7,993,5.333333333333333
267460,5,6300215261,"The secret to a successful performance of TOSCA is the dramatic tension linking the three main characters:  the good Floria Tosca, her lover Cavaradossi, and the evil Scarpia.  For the performance to work, the audience must be convinced of the evil nature of Scarpia.
  Cornell MacNeil's Scarpia oozes evil through every pore.  His lewd leers at Tosca, and the ease with which he orders all manner of torture, seeming to enjoy it as much as others are repulsed by it, provides an authentic flavor to his character.
  Placido Domingo's voice is at its very best, and to hear him sing Cavaradossi is, in itself, enough reason to enjoy this production.  Hildegard Behrens is a convincing Tosca, especially in the dramatic ""This is Tosca's kiss!""  She nearly injures her voice as she growls at Scarpia, ""Mori, mori, mori""--""Die, die, die.""  No other Tosca has better dispatched the unbearably monstrous Scarpia.
  The staging, lighting, set, and Sinopoli's conducting are simply marvelous, as is usually the case at the Met.  You can almost smell the incense, as Scarpia struts around inside the church. Of all the available performances of Tosca, this is the most dramatic, with excellent singing, acting, and casting. It will transport you back in history, and you will share the almost delicious pathos of the participants.  This is the very best Tosca.",1056672000,46,1352,5.031531531531532

267462,4,6300215261,"Domingo gets 5 stars in this performance of tosca.  his voice is at its most dark and dramatic stage and it fits the role perfectly.  His aria's are tear jerking and the pathos with which he carries himself is maddeningly exciting.  He commands the stage whenever he is on it and you can see and feel the excitement in his acting.  E lucevan le stelle was the highlight of the Dvd.  There is the occasionally nasal high note but; whatever he was still fabulous!
Behrens does fine.  I do, however, have a few problems with her .  Her voice is drmatic and glorious but there are many suspicious passages where you aren't sure if she is purposly croaking in anger for effect or whether she has lost control of her voice.  Her speaking voice is ghastly when she uses it, hoarse and hard to listen to.  Other than that she is a joy to hear.  Her high notes are full and forceful right to the end of an extremely difficult role.  Her tone is, however, evocative of Wagner and if that bothers you then you won't like her Tosca.  I disagree with the argument that she is not a convincing looking tosca. Part of what I love about opera is that its not about the beauty of thee performer.  She is not a youngster or a knockout, but that didn't keep me from beleiving she was in love with the dramatic painter.

Scarpia was poor.
  His acting was extremely convincing but his singing was poor.  It was hard to listen to his forced sound for several hours.  His vibrato came in, occasionally, but more often it was straight and flat.  When he sings high he appers to be under great strain.  This is too bad because i have hear Macneills Scarpia on records in hbis prime and It is really quite excellent; but not here!  This role was too much for macneils aging voice to handle.

267463,5,6300215261,"I think that this is a GREAT Tosca! Domingo is a really good actor, and his singing is fab. I have a CD of him singing Mario in Tosca, and I like him lots better when he sings live!
Behrens, the soprano that sings the role of Tosca, is an amazing singer and actress! She is not to good in her love scenes, but in the murder scene, she is AMAZING!!!!! And when Mario dies at the end, her acting is again, AMAZING!!!!!!!!
And for all of you people that are giving this Tosca bad reviews, since when do you know anything about singing? I think that the problem that you guys have is that you always look at the bad stuff and not the good stuff.

Tosca is my favorite opera of Puccini's, and this is the only good film I have seen.
I would go out of my way at any time to see Domingo, since he isn't wooden, as is the style in opera today.  His voice soars, and he actually brings something to Cavarodossi.
Behrens is an unforgettable Tosca (although I've often thought Tosca should be a little younger - but this isn't a crack on her.)",1002672000,13,518,4.17

And yet, for reasons I can't quite explain, something is missing in Behrens' Tosca. She really puts herself into the role, yet I just don't see her as Tosca in the way that Domingo is Mario Cavaradossi. This is purely subjective on my part, and if you are a fan of Behrens, her performance will definitely excite you.",998697600,17,484,4.843373493975903
267466,1,6300215261,"As one of the previous reviewers rightfully remarked, this is a thrilling production! It will surely send shivers down your spine. In fact those shivers might remain even after you have finished watching this opera! Why, the mere thought of it will make you shudder!!! It is not only the shallowness of the staging and performance, unimaginative light and set design, horrible acting... I suppose it is the unique combination of all those elements (to name the main ones) that makes this production so remarkable! And those lovely close-ups favored by the director of the video version! Behrens tenderly embracing Domingo's neck - malicious smile on her lips - some rolling of the eyes to show her passion - her grip on Domingo's neck tightening with every higher note she sings - mild surprise expressed on Domingo's face - Behrens getting higher and higher - Domingo getting blue in the face - despair in his eyes - a brief struggle for breath - Behrens doesn't give up easily - Hurray!  Cavaradossi releases Tosca's clutch, gulps some air and starts his aria... Well, the only argument in favor of this production is Placido Domingo's incredible - breathtaking voice! It has become almost a banality to say that Domingo is one of the greatest tenors in history. After hearing this recording I can only say that he really is!!! But believe me, this production is an extremely rocky path to this knowledge! Are you sure you'll make it to the end?? :)",998438400,5,1451,4.804
267467,4,6300215261,"I agree that Behrens just wasn't the fulfillment of Tosca.  She is always committed and gives her best - it just wasn't enough for this role - she does Strauss and Wagner much better!  This is a terrific performance by Domingo.  Not that his others aren't, but I thought he put more into this one than some of the others I've seen on video and in person.  No! Pav can't compare to Domingo in this role!  This ranks 3rd with me of videos featuring Domingo: the old movie, shot in Rome as well, is my favorite; ""The Settings and Times"" Rome, with Mehta and Malfitano, 2nd, and Verona with Marton (her ""Vissi"" was probably the best on video), ties this one for 3rd due to weaker cast members.  I have it on vhs and LD and consider it important to the collection for the production and Domingo alone.  But the casting is not up to par with the others.  I recently saw Malfitano with Leech in LA and they were performing at the top of their game.  She is a terrific Tosca and his voice and acting have improved remarkably.  If you can only have one video of Tosca, get the movie or Rome, however, if you want 3, buy this and enjoy the production and a ""different"" cast.  Above all, Domingo's arias are really very hard to beat in any video version - by any tenor in the last 40 years (including Corelli)!!!  This is one of his very best roles in every way! There are better Scarpias than Cornell; he was menacing but his voice was a bit tattered.  It's also nice to see the consistent performance of Domingo from his 30's through his 50's!

7806888,3,6300215261,"A lavish production this is, by Franco Zeffrelli in the mid-1080s. The picture is resplendent, fully period. At the pit is conductor Sinopoli, making his MET debut.
This performance, however, was not shorn of questions, and viewed some three decades later, the questions still persist to any novel viewer.
The first question is the choice for the titular heroine  the great Wagnerian soprano Hildegard Behrens.
Puccinis Tosca is representative of the Italian verismo style. The drama is intense, and the singers have to act with their voices with the music. However, Ms. Behrens here fought a lonely battle, and unfortunately, lost it. That she did not look overtly Italian is not the biggest problem; nor does the fact that she did not sound overtly Italian: we have the great Jussi Bjorling not sounding Italian either. Behrens portrayal of Flora Tosca was being let down on three fronts  firstly, conductor Sinopoli; secondly, director Franco Zeffrelli, and lastly, her partners MacNeil and Domingo.
Sinopolis overall reading of the score at this particular debut performance was overtly tentative and under-powered. The requisite orchestral support simply was non-existent. The overall music sounded hollow and weak, leaving his singers to solo stands most, if not all, the time. This is rendered even more unfortunate by the fact that Cornell MacNeil, who had the bulk to sing in almost two-thirds of the show, was past his vocal prime. MacNeil did a terrific job to play the role, but he looked and sounded like a hypocrite more than a brute, and a retired debonair more than a dangerous power player. In more or less similar vein is Placido Domingo, looking superbly suave, singing in a mellifluously aristocratic manner. His Cavaradossi is a noble demeanoured, suavely romantic figure rather than a heroic artist. The utterance of Vittoria, Vittoria is reminiscent of a chess players exclamation who has gained the upper hand. He, similarly, was not well supported by the orchestra at the pit.
Then, finally, Zeffrelli, who, too much of the time, only succeeded in filling the space with distracting stage business. When Cornell MacNeil, the Scarpia, steps forward at the end of Act One with his ''Va, Tosca,'' the director fills the stage immediately behind him with so many miming church-going supernumeraries that it becomes impossible to pay attention to the police chief's evil mutterings.
The scenery was sumptuous in the first two acts, remarkable chiefly for its monumentality and almost photographic realism. The final acts scenery, however, interrupts the flow of the opera and effectively destroys one of Puccini's great poetic atmosphere. Beginning with a scene on the ramparts of Castel Sant' Angelo, with the help of the stage elevators we are then transported to a dungeon where Cavaradossi and Tosca plot their escape. After Cavaradossi sings ''E lucevan le stelle'' in these murky surroundings, the dungeon drops and we are again on the ramparts. This is one of the various pointless ingenuity of the director.
Then, back to Tosca herself. Basically, the Italian verismo style has not been fully grasped by Behrens, as evidenced by her failure to negotiate plush legato lines in her singing. In this respect, Domingo is clearly more attuned to Puccinis style, and the Cavaradossi of Domingo has met with more success elsewhere.
A visually (or photographically) beautiful production, but not overtly dramatic nor musically exciting.",1393200000,3,3456,5.225225225225225
7806889,5,6300215261,"I have seen Tosca several times ""live"" on stage, but this version tops them all.  Cornell MacNeil was the perfect
Scarpia, not only with his voice, but with his evil expressions.  This Tosca was very believable in acting and voice.
