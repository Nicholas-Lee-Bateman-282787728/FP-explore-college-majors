7476901,4,B016P0GY76,"What if William Shakespeare had written ""Waiting for Godot"" rather than ""Hamlet""?

We might have gotten something like Tom Stoppard's ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"".

Taking the title characters (played by Gary Oldman and Tim Roth)two minor characters from ""Hamlet"" and focusing on them as they try to make sense of what is occurring around them and TO Hamlet himself, one is often confused for the other although they compliment rather than are the same in terms of personality, temperament, etc. These old friends of Hamlet's look at the goings on around them and conclude that they don't make any sense.

Featuring terrific performances all around including one by Richard Dreyfus (playing another minor character called only the Player) , the film an adaptation of Tom Stoppard's play, was originally to be directed by filmmaker John Boorman. Stoppard ended up directing the film himself and, although it's his own film as a director, he does an admirable job especially when it comes to working with the cast.

The blu-ray has some issues including noticeable video noise at the beginning of the film and while the film retains the look of a film, the grain management is a bit of a problem in this transfer but, on the whole, the film looks pretty good. The film was shot by Peter Biziou and some of the issues with grain is most noticeable in those scenes that are deliberately underlit.

The audio sounds fine although the stereo mix is most effective had conveying ambiance.

The special features are truly where this film shines. We get a nearly one hour interview with Tom Stoppard discussing the history of the play, the transition to film and working with actors as a writer and director.

There are also interviews carried over from the DVD with Stoppard, Dreyfus, Oldman and Roth that run anywhere from 30 minutes to nearly an hour as well. These interviews range from the making of the film to other roles they've played in other projects. These are solid interviews that provide us with some meat to chew on about the project and the approach these actors took to the film.

Although the image quality varies a bit, the presentation is solid over all although a bit better grain management would have been nice and eliminating of the video noise at the beginning would have been a nice touch as well.

The audio is solid  and we get subtitles in English. The bit rate for the transfer is pretty good as well. While this might not be the perfect release many have hoped for, the depth and detail have been improved over the DVD.

 I would give three stars for the video transfer, four stars for the  audio and special features to bring this release to three and one half stars overall.",1453680000,7,2710,4.752665245202559

7476903,2,B016P0GY76,"I love this movie and was very excited to see it come to Blu-Ray finally, unfortunately the picture quality is extremely poor. Apart from some dirt and scratch removal this appears to be the exact same transfer as the DVD from 2005, I have both and compared. It's extremely grainy, has poor color and contrast and in the grain there is digital noise, they clearly reused an existing substandard transfer of the film and slapped in on a Blu-Ray. It's so bad that it makes the movie look like it was shot on Super 8 (it was shot on 35mm) and is only a very slight improvement over viewing the 10 year old DVD up-scaled to 1080P but all it really makes clearer is the excessive grain in the transfer.

The only plus is there's a new 55 minute interview with Tom Stoppard from September of 2015, but that doesn't justify the purchase as that will likely be uploaded to YouTube at some point anyway.",1452556800,24,894,4.418181818181818

7476927,4,B016P0GY76,"The movie itself deserves five stars, but it loses a star for this particular version of the DVD.

Even though the back cover of this DVD clearly says ""Closed Captioned for the Hearing Impaired,"" there are no set-up options at all on the DVD itself. Also, if you try to use the closed captioning through your TV, it doesn't work. There are no language options available.

So if you need captioning, do not buy this particular DVD.",1475193600,2,430,4.571428571428571

8736966,3,B016P0GY76,"Finally ordered the Blu-ray! One of my favorite films, had it on DVD forever and a day. Is it a prestine transfer? No, but it is better than the DVD I can tell that. I also own the older DVD version without all the interviews so it was an easy upgrade... And I'll most certainly gladly buy it again with a Remastering for Criterion or the 4K format. The film is most definetly worth debuting as many times as necessary for an ever increasing upgrade in quality.
This first Blu-Ray edittion is very watchable and enjoyable even though it's definetly not reference quality but works on my 4K Curved Samsung well enough despite whatever obvious grain there is in the picture. Its clear enough for enjoyment and the new interviews are wonderful. Especially with Richard Dreyfuss. So, for only $15.00 most definetly worth it. I've seen worse Blu-Rays...",1522195200,,848,4.736486486486487

It's so bad it reminds me of the days when we had to add foil to our rabbit ears to get a picture on an old TV.  I have a part of the movie on my DVR, and the picture quality through my satellite provider was much better.  This Blu-Ray was a huge disappointment.  I guess I'll see if I can record it next time it's on cable.  Save your money.",1505174400,3,508,3.8737864077669903
