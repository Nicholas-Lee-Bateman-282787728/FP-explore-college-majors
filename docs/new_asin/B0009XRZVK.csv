8069863,4,B0009XRZVK,"This video was ok in my book.  I have watched several football documentaries and this one was middle of the road.  It wasn't as solid as it could have been.  I enjoyed it, but there wasn't that one thing that made this team special or stick out from the rest.  The coverage of the games, interviews with players + coaches, and the whole Texas high school football environment was nice, but the video kind of drug on and left me wanting to skip to the end to simply see if this particular team would end up winning it all.",1273104000,,521,4.232323232323233
8069864,4,B0009XRZVK,"Celina, Texas (30 miles north of Dallas) is a small community of about 2,000 people with a big reputation for its high school football program. They were riding the crest of 57 straight victories and 4 state championships in their division, 2A and then lightning struck during the summer before the 2002 season. Their legendary coach, G.A. Moore, resigned, seemingly for no reason, and moved down the road to their biggest rival, Pilot Point, along with 3 of the nine coaches. Their enrollment for the coming school year also put them over the 2A limit by three students and they were bumped up to 3A where they would compete as the smallest school in the division. Can they continue their streak under new coach Butch Ford, who coached under Moore for 25 seasons but had never been a head coach and handle the bigger schools? Narrated by NFL great Pat Summerall, the documentary takes you behind the scenes with the players, coaches, parents and fans as well as highlights from the season. In Texas, football is life, whether the NFL or the smallest communities. As one of the former players summed it up, 'the season lasts about eleven and half months in Celina"". If you love football, high school sports and small town America, this is for you. It is fun, lots of good football action and a look behind the scenes at the winningest football program in Texas history. Hollywood could not have crafted a better ending to a film. Enjoy!!",1248566400,3,1437,4.7063492063492065
8069865,5,B0009XRZVK,"This is a documentary about a true story of a winning high school football team.  The people who made the movie couldn't have known how it would turn out, and there were some inspiring moments.
If you are a coach or have a son who plays football, you should get this DVD. It's not a Hollywood production, but it's real.

8069866,3,B0009XRZVK,"This film truly is not all it was hyped up to be.  The only thing I truly enjoyed was game footage and the realism.  Better than ""Go Tigers"", but far from ""The Last Game.""",1182124800,2,171,4.0
8069867,5,B0009XRZVK,"Step aside Hollywood with your Friday Night Lights and take a lesson from the REAL players of Texas foobtall!!  PPG arrests your attention from the comments of the opening scene, as you fasten your seat belt and ride the season with the Celina Bobcats.  In one breath, you find yourself cheering on the Bobcats to victory, and in the next, you find yourself in awe of these young men with such a sense of character and community.  This is a film in our family's library that will be watched year after year, for the lessons about sportsmanship, respect and commitment are taught in such an honest and real way.  If you are purchasing a film any time soon, PPG MUST find its way into your cart!

8069868,4,B0009XRZVK,"Ken Heckmann's gritty documentary is Friday Night Lights without the Hollywood burnish -- the true story of small-town Texas highschool football, unrehearsed, unscripted, unglamorized.  The real thing, told with unflinching honesty and spiraling suspense by director Heckmann, whose fearless camera takes us right to the core of this American phenomenon.",1124928000,3,354,6.08
8069869,5,B0009XRZVK,"As a mother of two young boys I really do appreciate this movie.  It portrays TX high school football in such a positive light, there are no cuss words, sex or unnecessary violence -- it truly is a family film. The support that the entire community has for these players and the team is so remarkable-and what an ending!!!  More people need to see this great football movie.",1124409600,3,374,4.485294117647059
8069870,5,B0009XRZVK,"Friday Night Lights was a fun Hollywood view of H.S. football but the Power Passion & Glory is real.  It puts you on the field and in the locker room, pep rallys, and homes of the players who make up this documentary.  Terrific football action, suspense and emotion.  I played High School football and I just wish I had half of the quality coaching these kids got. My wife hates football but loved the emotion and excitement of this film.",1123804800,3,438,4.45
