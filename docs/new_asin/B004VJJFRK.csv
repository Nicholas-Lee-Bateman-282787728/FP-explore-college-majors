4482689,3,B004VJJFRK,"I was so excited when I saw that there was a Dogs 101 book.  My boyfriend and I watched the show religiously when we were researching which breed to adopt (we went for a herding breed).  The show is full of valuable information and I recommend it to all new dog owners and people considering a dog.

When I saw the book, I expected the perfect breed book, but what came in the mail was a book the size of a magazine that just mention a handful of breeds.  Quite the disappointment for me, but I'm a pet blogger (Keep the Tail Wagging - shameless plug) so I may not be the target audience.

I gave it 3 stars, because I think this could be a fun book for a kid who wants a dog; a book to start the discussion about what breed is best, responsible dog ownership, and the work that goes in to bringing a dog into a family.

4482690,3,B004VJJFRK,"I found this to be rather misleading.  I ordered this as I am a big fan of the show, but when I
received it, there was only 1/2 of a season on it.  It never really tells you what you will be getting.
I was hoping/assuming this would be the full season 1 (though admittedly it never says it is, but never says really what it is regardless).  What you will receive will be the first 5 episodes of season 1, which doesn't really seem worth it for the price.

I would have rated it lower even, but I do like the program, and it is a good quality video of the 5 episodes it does show.
You can either watch individual dog breeds, or the whole normal episode.

Hopefully this review will help someone else know what exactly they're getting.",1322784000,29,733,4.170212765957447
