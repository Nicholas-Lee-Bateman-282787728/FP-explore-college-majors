8336477,5,B001QUL6UQ,"Beautiful opera. Nice to have this recording with the late soprano, Daniella Dessi, and her partner.",1481241600,,100,5.3125
8336478,3,B001QUL6UQ,"Good sound, nice picture and very very pleasant voices. Dessi and Armiliato are just excellent - voicewise.
Ditto for Mastromarino, who sings the role of Gianciotto Malatesta.
But here the good impression stops.
Fabio Armiliato, an excellent, anorexic looking tenor, can act only himself. No smile, only perennial sour face, as if he's having a slice of lemon in his mouth. Moreover, and I must say it hesitantly, he is anything but handsome- and that's an understatement!! In the opera, Gianciotto, the bridegroom who is ugly and deformed, knowing that Francesca might refuse to marry him, sends his brother Paolo the handsome as his proxy. If they could not ""beautify"" the poor Armiliato, they should have dropped him. Francesca , and most women I know, would have opted for Mastromarino!
Daniella Dessi is a very good soprano, who could not act her way out a handbag.
Should have been issued as a CD , not a DVD.
The old DVD from 1984 with Scotto, Domingo, McNeil and Levine is still the best DVD.",1274918400,11,1000,4.786127167630058
8336479,4,B001QUL6UQ,"What a luxury--to have two videos of FRANCESCA DA RIMINI! This one is quite good, both Dessi and Armiliato are in good voice, the sets are striking and well done. If this were the only Francesca available, I'd be very pleased. But the competition is the classic Domingo-Scotto-MacNeill, which is hard to beat.  Still, I'm delighted to have this one, as well.",1242172800,22,358,4.774193548387097
