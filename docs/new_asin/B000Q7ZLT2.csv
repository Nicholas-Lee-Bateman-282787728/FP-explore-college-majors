its about  Kazuya Saotome is a nerdy second-year engineering student. His lifelong dream is to build a Doraemon (robot), and is trying to develop an artificial intelligence robot that happens to look like a toy squid. when Kazuya's wealthy rival, Kotaro Nanbara, gives him a computer program that supposedly will provide valuable information to help with Kazuyas research and development but is a virus that Nanbara created in order to infect Kazuyas computer and destroy his work. While attempting to fix his infected computer, Kazuya accidentally orders a ""Cyberdoll"" from the Cyberdyne Corporation website. A woman appears at Kazuya's door with a small package containing a cyberdoll named Hand Maid May. May is a palm-sized robotic doll who is very sensitive and sympathetic to Kazuya's feelings, likes, and needs. The early part of the storyline focuses on Nanbara trying to get May taken away from Kazuya due to his inability to pay for her. Nanbara enlists the help of several other cyberdolls to attempt to take May away from Kazuya, but all of them end up falling for Kazuya and failing to retrieve May.",1358121600,2,1176,4.9393939393939394
8293500,5,B000Q7ZLT2,"This is one of the first anime I fell in love with. A sleeper, it probably gets little respect because there are some panty shots. Apart from that, it is a straightforward story with your normal guy (though secretly very talented engineer) and one of each kind of your favorite anime girl types: ditzy cute, tsudere girl next door, little sister, sexy big sister, mother, glasses wearing bookworm, etc.

I can't help it, its a fun and touching story and I still like it a lot!",1217548800,3,476,4.534883720930233
