8250455,1,B0013EH71W,"This was a HUGE disappointment! Mr. Nongard could benefit from a speech coach or Toastmasters group as his delivery is spot on but his speaking ticks made it near impossible to stay plugged in. The information is basic as he states and I suggest you save your money as everything he goes over you can see for FREE on Youtube (plug in a search for NLP). There's also coughing in the background from someone off screen that is annoying and distracting. This was the BIGGEST waste of money I have ever spent on Amazon, don't make my mistake.

8250456,1,B0013EH71W,"The authors statement ""How to use cutting edge language patterns to influence people"" shows that he is truly ignorant to the basic concept of NLP. The quality of this material reflects the same attitude. Anybody that works with NLP concepts will figure out quickly that it can be used to change yourself and to help others willing to change themselves. Nobody has the power to influence someone that does not wish to be influenced. IMHO the author is not serious about the topic and yet another reason why NLP has such a bad reputation in the public eye.",1232582400,2,554,4.663265306122449
8250457,2,B0013EH71W,"I only give this two stars because although most of the content was good, it's presentation was at best, amatuerish.
Norgard continually uses the ""words"" umm, ahh, or stutters as he tries to figure out what he's going to say next. There are even frequent silences as he contemplates his next words. This happens so often that I found it distracting from trying to take in the information he was offering. (Couldn't they have edited that out?)
To add more, his voice echoed as if they were recording from a restroom stall. (Of course they weren't, it appeared to be done at a home office or something of the like.) Again, this distracted me from the actual content being presented.
I've seen high school kids' videos that were done MUCH better than this. It's worth about 20 bucks, not the near $90 it's going for.
Again for the most part, the content itself is good. Communicating that content was done poorly though.",1208822400,10,917,4.666666666666667
8250458,4,B0013EH71W,"There are some interesting reviews on this product.  I'll give you my two cents and hopefully it will prove helpful.

The low rating first...well, he is correct on basic production values.  I do think this is not that all important.  What is important is can I learn from this and if so, what?  Still, that is just my opinion.  If you can't stand a DVD without it being polished and flashy then this may be an issue in this DVD.

Second he talks about being able to use this to train business people.  I can see where he might get the impression this could be used for that.  On the back cover of the DVD it does talk about using NLP in business situations.  It doesn't claim you can use this DVD as a training DVD but I can see where one might get that.

Finally he talks about not liking the presentation and it being basic material.

Everyone isn't for everyone...Bandler had a pretty rough approach at times.  Again, if you are looking for polish and bells and whistles this isn't the product you are looking for.

So what about the material?

It is basic in many areas with some very nice specific applications.  I'll let others argue about how advanced this material may or may not be.  There are many large ego's strutting around the NLP world...I just don't want to go there.

What I would like to emphasize is the teaching medium.  When I first got exposed to this stuff it was some old Bandler with Frogs into Princes.  That was a book and I learned much from it.  Next followed a Nightingale-Conant cassette set of Anthony Robbin's ""Unlimited Power"".  I got much from this and found the audio presentation to be much better for me than book form.

Now it is just one step away from talking in person.  I very much like the conversational approach...it is very easy to learn from.

So, should you get this?

One bad review but he makes some points...it isn't flashy and it isn't the hottest, cutting edge stuff out there for the big guns in NLP.

For normal humans like me though it was a very nice way to learn things in a vastly improved format.  I did learn things on this set that will make my life happier.

I would like to give this four and a half stars (a half point off for production values, if you care about that thing).  It won't let me do a half star so...

four stars.",1208217600,11,2293,4.324705882352941
8250459,5,B0013EH71W,"This DVD set is chock full of information, presented in clear and direct fashon, which would lead anyone watching it to a greater understanding of NLP techniques and applicable methods for every day use.
It is shot and taught like a hotel based seminar, as Richard once again clearly brings a vast resource and wealth of knowledge about the subject home in clear and easy to understand terms, at an economical price point on this engrossing subject.",1205884800,4,449,4.8441558441558445
8250460,5,B0013EH71W,"I was happy with the DVD, it finally explained what NLP is and how to use it.  The examples were very helpful to me in changing some limiting beliefs.  The lecture is interesting, uses good examples and really taught me some new things.  Learning eye cues was helpful and the downloadable notes were helpful. I liked how the material could be adapted to a lot of different life situations rather than just sales or hypnosis.",1205884800,5,424,4.626666666666667
8250461,2,B0013EH71W,"The material is a basic overview of NLP, and was a little less than what the promotional material lead me to expect.  I really expected that this was something that I could use as training material for sales people and those interested in applying NLP, an expectation supported by the very high price.  What I received instead was essentially a home video that looks like it was filmed in a cheap office with poor lighting, including a set of plastic plants, and loud coughs from the sound crew.  There was obviously no script - he just stands up and wings it; consequently, the video lacks the conciseness that a training video should employ.  His examples more often than not miss the mark entirely, convoluting what he is trying to cover, probably because he didn't take the time to write a script.  His frequent references to ""speed seduction"" makes this video not only inappropriate for viewing in an office environment, but would prevent me from being able to recommend to an employee at all.  The video was also very self-promoting.  For a guy who has ""no pages left on his passport,"" wears ""nothing but Swiss time pieces like Rolex,"" and ""looks the part for consulting with $10 million clients,"" his low production quality screams, ""I made this video in an afternoon with almost no planning and duped you into paying way too much for it!""  He couldn't even afford to use powerpoint sides, instead relying on a flipchart!  By the way, the other review is a company owned by the maker of the DVD.",1205539200,18,1502,4.680608365019012
