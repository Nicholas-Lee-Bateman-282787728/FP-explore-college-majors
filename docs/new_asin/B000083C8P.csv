1823693,2,B000083C8P,"I just spotted the name of Teri Hatcher (recently memorable in ""Spy Kids"") on the cover of this actioner.  That sounds all the more interesting when you hear that one of the producer is Joel Silver, famous Hollywood player behind ""Matrix.""  But the result is just exactly what reminded me of its made-for-TV origin -- no imagination, no originality -- despite the decent acting from Ms. Hatcher.
It starts very promising.  Teri Hatcher's character Jane Doe is desperately trying to follow the orders given over phone, to retrieve her kidnapped boy Michael.  The film plunges into thriller ala the third ""Die Hard"" flick, and Jane is ready to break the law if she had to.  And she does, but it's too late to know that the kidnapping story is just the beginning of a long day.
It sounds good at first, but very soon the whole thing stops being interesting, with too many plot twists which you might find in ""Swordfish"" (yes, another Joel Silver production).  But ""Jane Doe"" is clearly meant to outdo the labyrinthine plotting of John Travolta's villan, for there is some DIA (not DEA), there is Rob Lowe appearing and vanishing, there is conspiracy theory (and more than one) and so on and on.  Frankly, I stopped to care in the middle of the story, being too confused.
As to its actions, don't expect much.  As I said before, it's made for TV flick, and you know that soon enough, watching not-so-exciting car-crash or gun-shooting.  At least, actioners like ""Fair Game"" had much explosions; here almost none.  And about its corny  dialogues, I have nothing to say except that the director is the writer of ""Iron Eagle"" series made in the 90s.
It is good to see Rob Lowe and Teri Hatcher still handsome and beautiful.  That makes me feel inevitably that they deserve much better than this average action flick.",1064620800,3,1809,4.707936507936508
1823694,1,B000083C8P,"This is an amazingly bad movie.  No plot, bad acting, poor production.  Warner Bros says it's 16X9 enchanced widescreen on the box, but they lied, probably to hype sales of this dog.  It's 4:3, either P&S or full frame, I can't tell which.  It's definately non-anamorphic.  Shame on you WB.",1044316800,5,290,4.72

1823719,4,B000083C8P,"As the first reviewer has correctly stated, the description/poster displayed for ""Jane Doe"" has NOTHING TO DO with the actual movie which it's connected with on this site... The actual movie which I just watched is titled ""Pictures of Baby Jane Doe"" and stars Calista Flockhart!!! I quite enjoyed THAT movie. It's a hip and touching portrait of a nutty bi-polar young woman who hooks up with a sensitive guy who writes for pulp detective magazines. As their love story unfolds in New York and Atlantic City, it becomes clear that she has major substance abuse problems. There are nice touches of dialogue concerning randomness and chaos theory and it's a story that will have a ring of authenticity for many people who have touched upon that path. Flockhart gives a really good performance, fluttering between lightness and darkness with a lot of insight and acting chops. It moved me.",1411430400,2,885,4.906666666666666
1823720,3,B000083C8P,"This movie has nothing to do with the description of the video. That was disappointing. Good pre-Ally McBeal movie of Calista Flockhart, though.",1410480000,3,144,5.304347826086956
1823721,5,B000083C8P,"I thought that this would be a drab plot, but Terri can really act. Precedes  her appearance in Desperate Housewives. She's a bit younger here, and looks and acts great.  A sleeper of a drama. good buy.",1365379200,,202,4.4324324324324325
1823722,5,B000083C8P,This was an okay movie. Good acting but the plot was very see through. It was an okay movie. I'm still glad I had seen it and not I have it to re-gift it for someone's bday.,1341360000,,173,3.7027027027027026
1823723,2,B000083C8P,"""Jane Doe"", for a made-for-television film, actually does have rather decent production values and the direction is overall pretty solid. Predictably, the film falters with uninteresting characters and a derivative plotline. Further, though Teri Hatcher is impressively attractive, she is unquestionably out of her element here. I found myself laughing at her repeated wails of ""Sick freak!"" mere moments into the film. High drama isn't her strong suit and she's better relegated to pedestrian fare like ""Desperate Housewives"" (where hammy performances are par for the course).

Ridiculously, her character's name is actually Jane Doe and not an alias, as mentioned in the film. I'm not entirely certain what the scriptwriter felt this added to the story, and yes, Rob Lowe plays her ex-husband ""David Doe"". Their son, Michael, is unbearably obnoxious and his incessant whining is heard throughout the film. As irritating at the character is, things only get worse after it's revealed that this puerile brat is an ""operative for the DIA"" along with his father. After the first fifteen minutes I was left hoping he had died at the beginning.

Sometimes the film brings to mind the old ""Batman"" series, in which the villans would contrive bizarre contraptions to kill the protagonists rather than a more direct, effective manner. At one point in ""Jane Doe"", Hatcher and her son are riding in the back of a cargo van. After the vehicle very obviously pulls to the side of the road, the son helpfully offers ""We're stopping!"". Within a moment the van takes off again, but the driver has bailed, leaving behind a strange rope system across the steering wheel. The kid looks through the glass window into the cab and - you guessed it - they're able to avoid certain disaster.

Oh, don't worry about me spoiling the plot, you've heard it all before in better films like ""Eagle Eye"" and ""Enemy of the State"". Who knows, in another time ""Jane Doe"" may have ended up in theatres. It's not much of a stretch considering soulless, like-minded films like ""Cellular"" and ""Paparazzi"" actually did inhabit theatres at one point.

The bottom line: only watch ""Jane Doe"" if you consistently ask very little from your entertainment time. There are a multitude of superior films that provide a similar action plot with much more imagination. This is only of interest to devoted Hatcher or Lowe fans. I give ""Jane Doe"" a generous two stars only because I've seen far worse films than this before.",1244332800,,2475,4.971014492753623
1823724,3,B000083C8P,"The film is hard to beat. From the first shot you are forced to experience the suspense taste: Terri Hachter due a phone call is forced to follow strictly every little indication for her son's life. A voice in off in the other side of the line orders her , the kinetic and frenetic rhythm will lead us finally to a brief climax though we suspect is not but the peak of the iceberg. There is much more; since she has been fired from her previous job, certain dark forces will work out on her and suddenly she will be blamed of a murder she didn't commit. The rest of the story will involve to her ex -husband, who is seriously implied in all that huge enigma.

Despite there are some lagoons in the script such that obvious sequence in which Terri enters to her previous job without any kind of problem - and since we know she is chased for FBI, police and the Security Personal which you and me assume slept or perhaps in Holidays, but I guess it was July Fourth or The First Day of the Year- or the extremely expected and more than obvious sequence of the ambush near the helicopter, the film keeps to maintain the interest through the way and entertains, without extreme intellectual effort from the spectator.",1113091200,2,1212,4.386666666666667

7978533,2,B000083C8P,"I wanted to rate this movie more like 1.5 stars. This could have been good, but the writer dropped the ball....multiple times. In the very beginning of this movie the plot starts off okay. Then it goes into a terrible spiral downward from the 20 min mark forward.  It really makes no sense after awhile. This is a made for tv action movie too, so expect subpar special effects. I'm glad I got this movie for very cheap as a video store was going out of business. I paid like one buck.....therefore, I'm not at a total loss.",1470528000,,523,4.336734693877551
