8339399,5,B001S2RDFO,"Great material: Grierson's classic ""Night Mail"" plus four others of about equal length that are closely related from various later years. Especially recommended for train buffs, postal buffs, and film buffs (and if you're more than one of those even better). Whatever ""digitally remastered"" really means, both video and sound quality of all five films is very good (pleasing contrast and color balance, neither washed out nor too dark to see, no scratches or tics, no hissing) - obviously they had the real originals, not copies of copies of copies. The accompanying booklet includes some essays, some diary excerpts, and some poetry. An official BFI release. Of course your equipment needs to handle REGION 2 PAL, so it's not for everybody in the states. For many more reviews (and better prices:-) go directly to amazon.co.uk yourself.",1365206400,,837,5.161764705882353
