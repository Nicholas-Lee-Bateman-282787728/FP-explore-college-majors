8613749,2,B00FAALXAQ,"I seem to be the only one who does not like this dvd. I find it painfully slow and hard to follow. For many of the exercises, the camera focuses on her pelvis and not the exercise. Thus, it's hard to follow exactly what she is doing. It is hard for me to get thru the entire hour program (long program). There is more instruction on the breathing system where it's 5 counts in and 5 counts out. I wanted to sell this dvd on Amazon but selling is restricted which does not make me happy after spending $34.95 plus sales tax on this dvd. On the pro side, the instructor seems to care and gives very detailed explanations and instructions. I have made 3 attempts and can't make it thru the program due to boredom. I find it tedious. As I mentioned, the camera focuses primarily on her pelvis and I find it hard to follow. This dvd does seem to work for the other 6 reviewers who love this dvd but not everyone likes the same dvd's. I found it to be an expensive mistake in purchasing it.",1446854400,8,984,4.184210526315789
8613750,5,B00FAALXAQ,This video really helps you know how to do the exercises and helps with the muscles you need help with.  Wish there was an intermediate level video.,1446422400,4,148,4.481481481481482
8613751,5,B00FAALXAQ,This is an excellent dvd for those who are trying to maintain their curvature .  You feel very good after following the breathing exercise and the stretches.  I would highly recommend this expecially if you do not want to have scoloiosis surgery.  I wish I new about this type of exercise before my curve got worse.  This helps with maintaining the flexibility in your back and teaches you how to breathe deeper.,1431388800,7,412,4.680555555555555
8613752,5,B00FAALXAQ,"I highly recommend The Cerny System for anyone, any age, who has scoliosis.  I was diagnosed with scoliosis in my early teens and wore a brace for about a year.  I always had back discomfort which turned to pain in my twenties.  I tried many things with little success until I met Jana (this was over ten years ago).  To my surprise and delight, after working with her for a very short time, my back pain disappeared!

A few years after meeting Jana, I moved across the country...and she gave me a series of stretches and core work to do on my own.  I did these diligently, and have continued to do these the last 7 years, because they help me stay in touch with my spine, and remain limber and pain free. After watching the DVD, many of the stretches and core exercises I have been doing are on the DVD!  This is great because I am getting more information and understanding, and Jana is so clear that it is like having a session with her in person!

Even though the DVD is new, Jana has been refining this system for years. I am one of her many success stories.  I have often talked about how it would have been life changing to have this information and support when I was first diagnosed.  So if you have scoliosis yourself or know someone who does (friend, daughter, son, parents, etc.) I would highly recommend this.  It is worth a try and could very well set you on your own healing journey!",1387152000,23,1398,4.318007662835249
8613753,5,B00FAALXAQ,"Wow!  What a wonderful, clear and gentle guide to Pilates.  While she has special focus on Scoliosis, it clearly applies to anyone with back problems (like me) - and really anyone at all.  I found this to be very easy to follow and her voice and manner soothing and the movements challenging but very do-able - well within my range.

With a nice trio of short, medium and long sessions to choose from, this DVD is a great tool for home Pilates workouts - a must have for maintaining my core strength to help both correct and support my spine!",1386460800,7,542,4.39
8613754,5,B00FAALXAQ,"Jana's detailed explanations and helpful tips keep me in my best pilates form. I used the videos when I have a little more time than usual for my daily routine, and every time I use them I am reminded of areas where I have room for improvement but also areas where I myself have improved.  The difference I feel in my body when I first unroll my mat to when I roll it up to put it away never grows old, and I'm indebted to Jana for empowering me to take better care of my body and my self.",1386460800,7,489,3.9393939393939394
8613755,5,B00FAALXAQ,Jana is a brilliant body worker. Guided by her keen intuition she has helped me realize spaces in my body I didn't know existed. I am glad to have this DVD to help me follow a home practice.,1386201600,8,190,4.026315789473684
