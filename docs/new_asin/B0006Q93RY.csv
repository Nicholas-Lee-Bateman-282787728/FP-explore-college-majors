8042359,5,B0006Q93RY,"Packer legendary quarterback Brett Favre allows LeRoy Butler, with whom he played with the Green bay packers, to come into his home and interview Brett, Deanna, and see his daughters. The guys spend some time on the golf course and other leisure. It is a wonderful insight into how Brett Favre and his wife live day to day like any other family. The puzzling part is to see LeRoy Butler as a Favre insider when we hear in 2009 that Butler maliciously shreds Favre's reputation for playing for the Minnesota Vikings after the Packers let him go. Any trust in Butler was misplaced. If you can keep that out of your mind you will really enjoy this relaxed look at Brett Favre.",1266796800,3,673,4.524590163934426
