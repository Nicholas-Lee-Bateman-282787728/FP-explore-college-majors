4530466,5,B0052P61WO,"really good.  I particularly liked the MRI research used to 3D model the metamorphosis.  That is good science.  Hard reliable facts.  And it also points to Intelligent Design.

While an atheist, I never knew such evidence existed for the theory of intelligent design.  I was just fed evolution and long ages until I preached it myself.  The change all started when a sweet Christian fellow college student kept coming to my door talking to me and praying for me in secret... then long ages later... after conversion and after researching the science for myself... I preach the alternative view

4530471,1,B0052P61WO,"Yes, the Metamorphosis video is a bait and switch, one of the many marketing tactics the Discovery Institute uses to promote its pseudoscience to the non-scientific public. Its duplicitous and bizarre goal is to confuse and mislead the public--most of whom don't understand the scientific concepts and details--in order to support the religious beliefs of DI Fellows. Why they feel compelled to do this is beyond comprehension; perhaps they think they are getting brownie points in heaven that will improve their situation when they get there.

Insect metamorphosis is a complex biological process whose cellular, biochemical, and genetic aspects are understood by developmental biologists. Not every genetic and evolutionary pathway is known in detail, but that is not necessary to know to understand the basic biological history and processes involved. Most importantly, there is no reason from the knowledge that developmental biologists have to suggest that non-material, supernatural processes are involved. Modern biological evolution by natural selection is sufficient to explain metamorphosis without resort to Intelligent Design Creationism. Claiming that metamorphosis is too complex to explain using natural biological processes, therefore a supernatural process must be invoked, is an argument from ignorance--a bogus, illogical argument that stops investigation and stifles knowledge. Evolution is a historical process so there is no scientific justification for demanding that intermediate steps in adaptations governing metamorphosis must have all happened at the same time--they didn't. Developmental biologists have demonstrated that intermediate adaptations in development were stable and had their own selective advantage long before the final complexity appeared that we see today. We know this because many organisms are known that remain at those intermediate stages, having never evolved more complex developmental processes. These less complex species live quite well.

The purpose of the video is not to educate the public but to confuse and mislead viewers. Potential viewers of this video should think twice about buying it or showing it to school children. The video's true purpose is to mischievously persuade the viewer that insect metamorphosis is too complex to be explained by modern biology, but that claim is a deception. Potential viewers should beware watching a video whose purpose is to persuade viewers by deliberately deceiving them. This is not a new idea. I am old enough to remember watching films in my public school high school biology class produced by the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Each film would correctly and scientifically describe what is known about some aspect of biology, such as organ function in the human body or societies of social insects such as bees, and at the end of each film a student would be presented a few minutes of the ""message"": a description of how the just-presented biological phenomena could only exist because they were created by God as stated in the Bible. Coincidentally, Biola University, where Paul Nelson resides, was founded as the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. The Institute offered a diploma after completion of a two-year curriculum. This model was based largely on the Moody Bible Institute. The Metamorphosis video is just an updated version of a typical Moody Bible Institute film with a ""message"" at the end, in this case updated from Biblical Creationism to Intelligent Design Creationism. Some things just never change!",1442188800,6,3524,5.536178107606679

this may well be the THE butterfly documentary of all time. I loved the details of these beautiful creatures featured in the film and the information provided about their transitions. It is an extremely informative and educational documentary that the whole family can enjoy together. I actually had no idea that butterflies came in so many different design. No school should be without this DVD in their library.",1421971200,3,560,4.77319587628866
4530489,5,B0052P61WO,"I've only watched the trailer and the short pre-views of this DVD. It seems to be a well-produced documentary about butterflies in general and Monarchs in particular, arguing the case for so-called Intelligent Design. The metamorphosis of the caterpillar into an actual butterfly is said to be a problem for Darwin's theory of evolution. Paul Nelson from Biola University and the Discovery Institute is prominently featured.

I don't believe in intelligent design in the creationist sense of that term, but I admit that the sneak peeks were a real guilty pleasure. Get real, guys, complete metamorphosis of the butterfly kind *is* difficult to explain on the basis of pure, reductionist, blind materialism! Of course, you're not allowed to actually *say* so, but since I'm pseudonymous, I might as well take my chances

However (a big however), there are problems with creationist intelligent design, too. The strict dualism between Mind and Dead Matter doesn't seem to make much sense. Since everything points to the universe being very old, it's difficult to see why a supposedly omnipotent deity waited millions of years before creating the first butterflies out of nothing (or out of a pre-butterfly by an enforced macro-mutation). Why couldn't the deity rig the process in advance of the Big Bang? Or why can't the universe be a creative, ever-evolving emanation from a pan-en-theistic deity? Or a fallen emanation? This kind of soft teleology, with evolution based on some kind of pre-existent information matrix, makes most sense of the facts.

So yes, Virginia, butterflies really did evolve. So did moths, bombardier beetles and, cough cough, creationists. And no, the process wasn't strictly materialist or blind. Intelligence, consciousness and goal-directedness are parts of the deep structures of the universe. The butterflies are a particularly beautiful manifestion of these structures. Humans arewell, perhaps a more ugly (and blind) one. And yes, after spewing all this rank mysticism, I presumably have to go back to the 19th century, where I clearly belong!",1420502400,,2076,5.323170731707317

4530495,3,B0052P61WO,"I'd recommend watching this right up until everyone involved starts spouting religious nonsense. The butterflies are beautiful, and nature is amazing, but butterflies are no more proof of God than cats or bees or Hitler. And it is a shame the way they lure you in with a first half that is honestly about science and nature before all the talking heads spin it into alleged proof that evolution doesn't exist and the only conceivable reason for butterflies being pretty is because God wanted us to enjoy them. Forget the fact that beauty is a man-made concept and does not exist beyond the eye of the beholder. I am not anti-God or anti-Darwin, nor do I think either concept nullifies the other, but I am anti-religious-propaganda-masquerading-as-a-nature-show. Still, the first part of this focuses on real caterpillar and butterfly facts and footage, before leaping to crazy conclusions. So I recommend a little over half of this---it isn't surprising that more than half focuses on fact; it doesn't take nearly as long to say ""butterflies are pretty, so God musta made 'em!

4530507,4,B0052P61WO,"My family has been on a butterfly kick for well over a year now. We currently have two monarchs in waiting (chrysalis stage). I imagine the content of this documentary is geared more toward junior high and upward, but my 6 year old was able to connect some dots, which I found surprising.

Some criticize the documentary for being Intelligent Design (ID) propaganda, to those I would point out that this documentary was marketed as being ID. If you find ID offensive and you struggle giving attention to a different view without getting the vapors, you have issues.

The ID-emphasis was very subtle until the conclusion of the documentary, even there, it didn't come across as forced. They presented all kinds of facts about the uniqueness of each stage of the butterfly from the placement of the egg on very particular plants, the caterpillar, cellular structures (two blue prints), metamorphosis, and diversity make this creature stand out from all others. After expounding on these undeniable facts, ID is introduced...basically a foregone conclusion based on facts presented. I do think it would have been more helpful to have contrasted the butterfly with naturalistic assumptions earlier on in the documentary. If naturalistic evolution is true, and all things instinctively direct themselves merely toward survival/propagation...then why is it that reproductive organs are not present until after the metamorphosis to butterfly? Why would a butterfly commit itself to one plant for its offspring to feed off of when ultimately it forms a totally different digestive system for processing nectar (this has proven to be disastrous for the monarch)? Why would a caterpillar expose itself to so much danger by hanging motionless from a button of silk (completely exposed) for over a day, then continue in an equally precarious state for 2 weeks in a chrysalis?

Granted, I think the thoughtful viewer would ponder many of these questions, but that likely gives too many viewers too much credit. I would have liked to hear more comparison and contrast, especially with regard to the two blue prints embedded in the caterpillar. A number of times it was mentioned that this shows the end state was in view from the beginning, meaning it couldn't have simply occurred over time through genetic mutation. If any one thing goes wrong, the caterpillar dies, and having no reproductive organs makes it difficult to propagate another generation to give genetic mutation another go.

I'm probably nit picking on these points, but this could have made for an even more compelling film. The documentary is well worth watching. The butterfly is a truly amazing creature, and a marvel at each stage of its life cycle. This is something the documentary communicates so well. Most documentaries take away any sense of wonder - this is filled with it, to the point of being doxological. Wonderful!",1404691200,,2884,5.103813559322034

4530509,5,B0052P61WO,This is one of my favourite Illustra Media DVD's.

4530512,1,B0052P61WO,"The title of this DVD should really be ""How to Get Intelligent Design into the Classroom"". I hope my review helps at least one teacher make a more informed decision.

I saw this DVD at the library. Beautiful cover. Professional looking. Intriguing subject. 5 star average review. Seemed like a great choice. Up to the very end of this DVD, it seemed like a typical nature documentary, professionally produced, full of the wonder, beauty and mystery of life. I was a little suspicious of the low quality of the ""experts"", it was apparent these were not reputable scientists, but it was not a big deal, what do you expect from a nature DVD?

Then, close to the end, out of the blue, the DVD totally shifts gears, as a very heavy-handed intelligent design message is thrust on the viewer. The message is that butterfly metamorphosis is way, way too complex to have happened by natural selection, as the intermediate steps would be impossible to all happen at one time, and because the gap is too big to bridge, so there must have been an ""intelligent designer"". Who or what that ""intelligent designer"" might be is conveniently not mentioned or even speculated on.

This DVD is definitely a ""sucker punch"", a classical bait and switch, rather devious. I admit that the fine print on the back says ""were they designed for a purpose by an intelligence""? So it's not exactly false advertising. But who reads the fine print? Face it, the title could have been something honest like ""Metamorphosis: The Case for Intelligent Design"". But that wouldn't serve the underhanded purpose.

Instead, the DVD is cleverly designed to suck in the unsuspecting (like me) to give the impression of a genuine science-based nature DVD (hopefully to show in a science class), when in reality it's just a propaganda effort by the professional and dedicated staff at the deceptively named anti-science ""Discovery Institute"". (Why don't they just be honest and say ""Intelligent Design Institute""?) The intelligent design message is not an aside of the DVD, it's the whole purpose. The rest of the DVD is cleverly designed to prepare the viewer for the final message.

In the past, intelligent design advocates have argued that the the eye, the bacterial flagellum, the first land vertebrate, complex enzyme sequences, etc. could not conceivably arise from natural selection, because the intermediate steps would have no functionality, so it would take an intelligent designer to see the end result that would justify the intermediate steps. In other words, a half-built eye or fish with legs or incomplete enzyme pathway would have no purpose.

It's a classic straw man argument. The eye (or metamorphosis) could not have evolved in one (apparently miraculous) step, so obviously an ""intelligent designer"" did it. Well, as the result of real science research, it has been shown how the incredibly complex vertebrate eye evolved step-by-step, each intermediate step being functional. The same for enzyme sequences, the bacterial flagellum, and the recently discovered fossils that clearly show how fish evolved to eventually walk on land as the first amphibians.

The key is that the intermediate steps DO have function. Just like it appears miraculous that a dome can exist when the scaffolding is gone, it appears miraculous how complex biology evolved, if you ignore the intermediate steps. There are many, many simpler kinds of metamorphoses, just like there are many simpler kinds of eyes. Just like the eye developed small step by small step, so did metamorphosis. First there was a primitive eye that just sensed light and dark, just like there was a primitive metamorphosis that just made small changes in body form.

When the facts become too hard to ignore, some creation scientists eventually acknowledge the previous ""missing link"" is filled in. But they just move on to the next ""gap"", in this case incredibly complex butterfly metamorphosis. Ignoring the work of real scientists in the field, they throw up their hands and say ""We don't understand how this gigantic leap developed in one step by natural selection, so it must have been designed"". ""And by the way, we have no idea who the designer was, not even a clue"". ""Oh, but just maybe, slightly possibly, it might have been God"". Because their purpose is not to do science. Their purpose is to get ""creation science"" into the science classroom, as an ""alternative theory"".

They ignore the realities of the wide variety of simpler metamorphoses throughout nature which gives clues how metamorphosis developed step by step over many millions of generations over vast periods of time. Of I forgot, almost half of Americans think humans were created by God within the last 10,000 years or so. And about 5% of Americans think the moon landing was staged, that we never landed on the moon. There is a lot of nonsensical beliefs, and unfortunately this DVD  supports anti-scientific thinking with its strong intelligent design message.

This DVD goes way out on a limb when it suggests that the ""intelligent designer"" made butterflies for their beauty, that is for us humans to appreciate. Sorry, folks, but those butterflies have been around for many millions of years before humans ever appeared on earth. And supposing butterflies were specially created as beauty objects for us to appreciate, does that mean the ""intelligent designer"" specially created mosquitoes to suck our blood and spread disease, parasitic worms to burrow through our insides, lice to infest and sicken us as they universally did until modern hygiene, cockroaches to infest our dwelling places, etc. The intelligent design argument is full of contradiction and convenient excuses. It never makes a testable assertion. It is more a philosophy and belief system than a scientific argument.

Look at the ""experts"" in this DVD:

- Ann Gauger at the deceptively named ""Biologic Institute"" in Redmond, WA, whose motto is ""The more we learn about life, the more clearly it reveals design"". Their website says ""Most of our funding has been in the form of grants from Discovery Institute"". This is just an arm of the Discovery Institute.

- Paul Nelson at Biola University, whose motto is ""Biblically Centered Education"". Biblically centered eduation is not science. It's totally the opposite. Wouldn't it be OK to keep ""biblically centered education"" in churches?

- Richard Stringer at Harrisburg Community College. One publication. I have nothing against community colleges, they serve a great education mission. But the reality is no reputable scientists contributed to this DVD. The Discovery Institute has a network of scientists, almost all of strong religious bent, who receive stipends and other support to support a basically anti-science mission.

As an aside, the notion that there is a conspiracy, even unspoken, among scientists to suppress intelligent design research is nonsense. Sure more than a few dogmatic scientists are resistant to the new. And sometimes it takes a new generation to have an idea accepted. But this kind of conspiracy thinking shows a misunderstanding of how most scientists work. Admittedly, most are not religious, it is rather different from their logical, methodical, experiment-driven way of thinking, but most are not ""against"" religion. You might say their ""religion"" is to find the truth, obsessively plodding away in their labs with their fancy equipment. Many scientists are happy to totally upset the apple cart with a revolutionary new discovery, whether cold fusion, how DNA works, plate tectonics, evolution theory, parallel universes, intelligent design, X rays, N particles, expanding universe, nuclear fission, atomic theory, quantum theory, arsenic-based DNA, relativity, cell theory, countless others eureka moments. That is how they get their Nobel prize! Plus a kind of guaranteed immortality. Many scientists (including myself) would jump at the chance to publish a paper in support of intelligent design if they found good evidence. The discoverer would be one of the most famous of all time, because solid evidence for intelligent design would be so radical and paradigm-shattering, would totally turn science on its head, would have everyone in a lather for a while (and then we would adapt). And scientists know from experience that if they find something new, someone else will soon find it. It has happened countless times, so they rush to publish first. Scientists love to demolish other's research found to be irreproducible, sloppy, etc., that's part of their job, that's how science usually works. So when scientists lambast intelligent design results, it's nothing personal against intelligent design, it's just that the research results (to date) are so shoddy and flimsy, and seem so obviously politically motivated, totally against the apolitical bent of science in general.

As another aside, be careful what we ask for, you might get it. Consider what might happen if intelligent design was proven by the scientists to be real, and it turned out the intelligent designer was God. Do we really want scientists ""studying"" and doing experiments on God? Where would that leave religion? If there is an intelligent designer, you can count on scientists figuring it out. If it can be discovered, it likely will be, they need no encouragement, all of life and biology is right in front of them, subject to their study. Will we never cease our arrogance trying to put ourselves on a level with God? What would be next? Send spaceships to find and study heaven? Catch the intelligent designer in the act? Carry out experiments to quantify the soul?

Religion is a beautiful thing, based on faith, that gives hope and meaning to humanity in the face of the adversities of life. Science is a rational process for asking and answering common-sense questions, hopefully to improve our lot, for example by eradicating diseases. Everyone except the sociopath appreciates the beauty and wonder of butterflies, including everyone associated with the DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD uses those emotions as part of professionally designed propaganda in an attempt to get intelligent design (creation science) into the classroom. Why can't we just appreciate the beauty of the butterfly, better understand it's biology, figure out why the rapid population decline (which the video totally does not mention), take steps to prevent it's demise, and not use the butterfly as a smokescreen to get anti-science ""intelligent design"" into the classroom?",1398038400,24,10500,5.166470588235294
4530513,5,B0052P61WO,This is sooo fantastic.  I had no idea butterflies were so complicated.  To think they came about by chance instead of by our wonderful Master Designer God you would have to turn your mind off.  Butterflies are amazing and we love this DVD.,1395964800,,240,4.534883720930233
4530514,5,B0052P61WO,I found this to be a refreshing and clearly documented argument for intelligent design.  Those who promote evolution as described and shown the new Cosmos series are living in a fantasy world.  Natural law takes complex things apart to simple things not the reverse as they would promote.  They show a mutation in the DNA causes eyes to appear in worms.  The question to ask is where the DNA came from?  Metamorphosis reveals the DNA had been programmed from the beginning to allow a simple structure to create a complex structure in just a matter of days.

You'll never forget about the process a caterpillar goes through in forming a crysalis, digesting most of its insides, reforming them into an entirely new creature, and emerging as a butterfly.

Of particular note is how the caterpillar largely disintegrates itself in order to form a butterfly.  It is interesting how you think is so simple really is far more complex and intricate when you begin to really examine it and I'm sure that the film only scratches the surface.

4530571,5,B0052P61WO,"This is a truly excellent production!  Absolutely beautifully arranged, magnificent cinematography, and intelligently presented.  My wife and I sat there marveling at how amazing the butterfly is.  While it's understood that this movie is made by Christian producers, what I most appreciated is that it is not at all preachy (nor does it need to be).  Creation is itself a marvelous testimony of the reality of a Creator and I think this film inspires that sense of awe and realization.  Yes, it is clearly derogatory of any alleged evolutionary process, but not in a smug way.  Rather, as the science is presented, it becomes so apparent that evolution just pales in any ability to manufacture a reasonable explanation for the beauty and marvel of design that is represented in the butterfly.  It shouldn't be a surprise to those that believe in Evolution that a video presented by those that believe in Intelligent Design would seek to highlight their view.  What I find to be so great about this video is that it effectively and honestly presents the view with exceptionally scientific and logical reason based on clearly observable processes of nature (not manipulated arguments).  Whether you agree with the concept of Intelligent Design or not, this video presents a reasonable argument and it is clear to see why many are led to a conclusion of Intelligent Design simply because of the design that is absolutely physically apparent in the metamorphosis phenomenon of the butterfly.  This ""miracle"" doesn't need anyone to manipulate a convoluted argument to make a simple point; that it clearly appears to be the product of absolutely intelligent design.  Some may not like that conclusion, but they shouldn't be offended merely at the likelihood that many will come to this opinion by observing the evidence. Wonderful production!  Fascinating no matter what your ""faith"" position may be.

As a Jesus-follower myself, I actually tend to be exceptionally critical of most of the production put out by the mainstream Christian media.  Sadly, so much of it tends to be badly produced, poorly acted, and embarrassing to behold.  I get annoyed at the typical religious patterns that most Christian movie makers tend to fall into; where everything has to exist in this perfect little bubble view of humanity and every story has a perfect, happy ending with no questions left unanswered in convenient little cookie cutter design... not to mention that every production, no matter the subject, has to have the typical evangelistic appeal at the end, complete with some portrayal of the sinner's prayer, etc.  It's so pattern and so un-real and so un-interesting.  Where are the great storytellers like C.S. Lewis and J.R. Tolken who were able to fascinate an audience, stir minds, grip hearts, and -yes- not be afraid to allow their faith influence their art, but didn't fit into a convenient and predictable mold?  Why can't we also have scientific exploration documentaries that, sure, are produced by those who are inspired by genuine faith, but presented honestly and without a big propaganda push  behind everything.  That's what I love about this video.  Some will certainly accuse them of propaganda, but I would propose this alternate argument...  Why can't a group that is fascinated and inspired by scientific research, especially when it effectively illustrates their conviction of faith in a Creator, share that excitement with others.  Why does that only have to be thought of as ""propaganda""?  If I believe in something, my tendency is to share what I believe with others because I find it exciting.  In my opinion, this video fits in that paradigm.

From the crucial task of finding just the right species of leaf on which to attach her egg, the virtual dissolution of the caterpillar into a watery grave, its eventual resurrection into a completely different mode of life for which it is perfectly suited, and annual migrations dependent on the Methuselah generation for survival, the evidence for a Designer is on display in this small creature, in its hundreds/thousands of species. Marvelous photography and informative CGI.

Viewers should get the free companion PDF from Discovery-org, which relates how Nabokov (yes, that one), an expert on butterflies, rejected Darwinian explanation for several reasons based on his expertise, especially regarding the absurd perfections of mimicry.

The argument for design is given briefly at the end. How could such a life cycle have evolved? Without an overarching plan for ""resurrection"", how could the cell death of virtually the entire caterpillar have ever been selected for? How could two entirely different modes of life, requiring entirely different, specialized organs (eyes, proboscis, wings, etc.) have developed gradually?

In this minute creature, Darwinism is faced with another seemingly insurmountable problem. And as we discover the molecular workings of life, the macro view of ""something that looks like a fish became something that looks like a fish with legs"" becomes more and more vacuous to the thoughtful observer.",1347580800,2,1568,5.525

Still, the grand mystery remains, how such a miraculous change is genetically programmed, and scientists are still exploring those processes.

This beauty and splendour of the objects around us, it is ever to be remembered, is not necessary to their existence, nor to what we commonly intend by their usefulness. It is therefore to be regarded as a source of pleasure, gratuitously superinduced upon the general nature of the objects themselves, and in this light, a testimony of the divine goodness, peculiarly affecting.""

4530582,5,B0052P61WO,"This film is beautifully shot and narrated, and is a fascinating look at the amazing life cycle and migration of butterflies. My family and I really enjoyed viewing it. I came home one day and found my kids watching it on their own. The movie also explores the implications for intelligent design as an explanation for the caterpillar/butterfly development.

Francis Crick said in ""What Mad Pursuit"" that biologists must ""constantly keep in mind that what they see is not designed, but rather evolved."" Other evolutionary biologists have made similar statements. Design itself, or at least the appearance of design, doesn't really seem to be debatable. It is the *mechanism* of that design that is currently causing argument and controversy. Prior to Darwin, there was a general belief that there was a designer, going all the way back to Greek philosophy of ""matter"" and ""forms."" What Darwin brought to the table was a purely materialistic explanation for the design we observe, through the mechanism of natural selection. In order for natural selection to ""design"" life, potential biological advantages (via mutations) must be passed on to their offspring through reproduction. The organism must *reproduce* to explain the evolution of ""designed"" creature. It is essential for the objective reviewer of this film to keep this in the forefront of their mind.

Why? A caterpillar is a fully functional organism that *doesn't reproduce* in its caterpillar form. The only way for this species to reproduce and pass on its genome is to form the chrysalis, trigger the activation of isolated dormant genes, digest the flesh of the caterpillar, and form the highly advanced butterfly structures. Essentially, one insect dies to becomes a totally different and sophisticated insect! For evolution to be true, with respect to natural selection, all of the genes for a butterfly *must be* present, functional and regulated in order for the caterpillar/butterfly to reproduce--in the first generation.

4530583,5,B0052P61WO,"We have all seen and marveled at the colorful designs of various butterfly species in our backyards, or along a path in nature [My son Jeremy has an entire collection of butterflies of various sizes and many colors he brought back from our stay in West Africa]. But seldom, if ever, have we stopped, and asked questions like these, a) Where do they come from? b) How do they sustain themselves? c) How do they reproduce? d) How and where do they spend the cold months of winter? And e) How do they die?

 This DVD offers a rare insight into the lifecycle (i.e. the development) of a butterfly from an egg, laid by its female parent on the underside of a leave, hatching into a voracious leaf-eating caterpillar, to suddenly stop growing and transforming itself into a chrysalis, from which it emerges as a full-grown butterfly, able to fly from flower to flower and find its nourishment no longer from leaves, but from the nectar of flowers, which he forages with his specially-designed proboscis.

 Most amazing in this lifecycle is the spectacular migration of the Monarch butterflies before the winter from Northern USA and Canada to Mexico's Transvolcanic Mountains, and their return in the spring to the same location as their parents, laying their eggs in the very place the new generation of butterflies has never seen nor visited.

 What accounts for this precisely programmed migration, as well as the precisely programmed mutation from a caterpillar to an adult Monarch butterfly, with no visible blueprint for its intercontinental migration.

 Before ending this review, a special mention must be made for the superior excellence in cinematographic, photographic, microscopic, and computer animated representaton combined with magnetic resonance imaging documentation displayed all along in this fascinating and spectacular movie. The narrative is supportive of, and parallel with, the visual documentation, without ever becoming intrusive.

 Thanks to these advanced, hitherto unavailable, technological tools, scientists and biologists and entomologists are now able to examine the butterfly's ""superbly engineered body, its compound eyes made of thousands of individual lenses, its colourful wings covered with microscopic solar panels that warm the insect's muscles for flight, and navigational systems that unerringly guide Monarch butterflies on their annual migration from Canada to Mexico.""

 In the last part, as would any decent observer, the producers raise the question of how this came all about; they are not shy, and nor should they be, of raising the distinct possibility of an intelligent design (implying a Designer), rather than attributing this extraordinary and incredible biological transformation and amazing intercontinental migration to a random process of chance and natural selection.

 Some reviewers have critiqued, if not criticized, the producers' perspective on intelligent design vs. a process of natural selection by random evolution.

 It just escapes my feeble mind how such would be possible, not over millions and billions of years, but well night within the span of a couple of days and weeks. And if this transformation can be defined as `evolution,' then this evolution is very well `designed,' indeed.

 After watching this amazing video, you will never be able to look at nature around you OR see the world around you with the same eyes, and much less with the same worldview. This DVD will provide you, indeed, with a life- and worldview-changing experience. If only for that, it is worth paying the price for it, including the shipping

4530584,3,B0052P61WO,"I just bought (and watched) a new movie called Metamorphosis: The Beauty And Design Of Butterflies and thought I'd provide a little review.

This is one of the best Butterfly movies I have seen.  The incredible detail in the video is fantastic!  It is also very educational.  One of the main reasons I purchased this movie is because I had read where they do an MRI on a Monarch Chrysalis.  It was for that reason alone that I purchased it.

Where I have a major criticism of this movie is when it gets into evolution versus intelligent design.  I'm assuming most folks know about evolution, but maybe not so much on intelligent design.  Here's a link to the Wikipedia definition so you can read about it yourself.  What I wish they would have done is just present the science and factual parts about the Butterfly and not become involved in the whole evolution versus intelligent design argument.  To me that detracts from the actual beauty and incredible photography of the video and of Butterflies in general. I didn't buy the video to become convinced of evolution or intelligent design, I bought it to learn about Butterflies and I found it unfortunate that towards the end of the movie it tries to make an argument in one particular direction (I won't spoil it for you).

So, I'd give this movie 4 out of 5 Butterfly wings for the cinematography and factual information.  It loses a Butterfly wing (or two) for introducing intelligent design version evolution.

** Sorry I need to say a little more on this movie.  I feel like I was politically sucker-punched.  There was no reason to introduce these different agendas for folks who were simply hoping to come see an educational movie about butterflies.  Suggesting the butterfly wings are beautiful not for evolutionary reasons so it must be some intelligent entity design is attempting to enforce a political agenda. which I found quite unfortunate that they decided to go that route.",1325980800,10,1942,4.786786786786787

4530590,5,B0052P61WO,"Metamorphosis: The Beauty and Design of Butterflies is Illustra's latest offering in a growing collection of documentaries. I am a dad of two boys, ages 4 and 2, and having seen it with me, now they beg me to watch it over and over with them. ""Butterflies, daddy!""

I think that is a major testament of how aesthetically pleasing and approachable this movie is among Illustra's other excellent documentaries.

The cinematography is breathtaking. More than just that, the producers do an excellent job of piling layer upon layer of the complexity and intricacy that goes into the design of the life of a butterfly. The case for design becomes intuitively stronger as the documentary goes on, but the philosophical/theological points aren't made until the last few minutes of the film. Meanwhile, you learn and see all sort of interesting things about the life of a butterfly. You get to see the architecture of the egg from under a microscope. You get to see an up close of the chubby little caterpillars molt and become larger and larger chomping machines. There is step-by-step computer imagery that takes you inside the transformation that goes inside the chrysalis. Defying the logic of natural selection, you see the caterpillar self-destruct only to rebuild  itself from well... goo. The producers illustrate this by a Model T driving down the road, suddenly unfolding a garage over itself, collapsing, and then out of the rubble emerges a helicopter.

The producers also explore the journey of millions of Monarch butterflies who make the improbable migration from North American to a Mexican mountain range every year. The butterflies have an internal navigation which is sensitive to magnetic fields that guides them where they need to go. This migration is especially odd; most Monarchs live only 2-4 weeks. But during migration time, the Monarch lives up to 9 months to make this journey south for the winter to lay eggs.

As I said, the philosophical argument comes towards the end of the film. The viewer has already seen the complex step-by-step process of the metamorphosis of the butterfly. Each process must go perfectly to make sure for survival, there is no room for the tinkering of the slow, step-by-step process of natural selection. It all has to work perfectly on the first go, or there is no butterfly, if I understand the argument correctly. If this is so, then a purposeful and intelligent mind makes more sense in explaining this process working over the unguided process of neo-Darwinian evolution. This isn't a quote from the movie, but mathematician Granville Sewell makes basically the same point that Paul Nelson and the other scholars on the film make when he says:

  ""The process of transforming a caterpillar into a butterfly is surely far more complex than anything ever accomplished by man. The information needed to control this process, stored somewhere in the caterpillar's cells, must be far greater than that stored in any man-made computer program. And explaining how this enormous program arose through many ""5 or 6 character"" improvements is even more challenging here, because now the intermediate stages are not just useless, they are fatal. Metamorphosis involves the destruction of the caterpillar: the butterfly, with an almost completely new body plan, is constructed from dissolved and recycled tissues and cells of the caterpillar. Now we are not talking about climbing Mount Improbable, we are talking about building a bridge across an enormous chasm, between caterpillar and butterfly.

  Until construction of this extremely long and complicated bridge is almost complete, it is a bridge to nowhere. Unless a butterfly (or another organism capable of reproduction) comes out at the end, the chrysalis only serves as a casket for the caterpillar, which cannot reproduce. Now we do not have to simply imagine uses for not-quite-watertight vacuum chamber traps, we have to imagine a selective advantage for committing suicide before you are able to reproduce, and that is a more difficult challenge!""

There is also sheer gratuitous beauty of butterflies that seems to defy just blind, natural forces at work. The design and beauty seem to be more at home in a theistic worldview than on a purely naturalistic worldview. Over all, this is probably the video I would start with in introducing anyone to intelligent design. It's very accessible, visually appealing and you learn a lot about the life of a butterflies from the first two parts of the movie. The inference to intelligent design is made poignantly at the finish, but it's made without overstatement.  It's a great blend of art, philosophy and science all rolled into one that people of all ages could appreciate. I have definitely come away with a greater appreciation for the flair and imagination of the Creator from watching this film.",1321833600,6,4853,5.089308176100629

The one example I use all the time is the metamorphosis of the butterfly. To come into the world a crawling catepillar and become a cacoon and end up 10 days later into a beautiful flying machine is something else. Also the catapiller born in Canada flying 2500 milles every year to the interior of Mexico without a roadmap is pointing to an Inteligent Being behind all this.

4530593,5,B0052P61WO,"As a scientist, inventor, teacher, and Daddy, I appreciated the REMARKABLE quality of this film on several levels.

As a Daddy, to hear my 9yr son exclaim on several occasions, ""That is SOOOOOO cool."" during a movie where there are no explosions or spaceships is really an accomplishment.

The photography was truly remarkable. I won't spoil it with words. You simply must see it.

The science was cool...I had already been using the recent discoveries (2009) of the Monarch migration and circadian clock in my science classes as a fabulous illustration of employing proper controls in a scientific study. The 3-D MRI imaging of the metamorphosis during chrysalis stage is also stunning.

As a science teacher, I am always looking for ways to capture the students' imagination...science is a PROCESS, not a collection of facts. Even something as apparently mundane as the butterfly you saw just this afternoon crossing the parking lot is barely understood. There is plenty of science left for everyone to discover; one just has to get really curious about something and then devote some of your life to study it and to illuminate it.

(btw, for you homeschooling families, there is an excellent question and answer portion in the Bonus Features that focuses on the scientific details. Very useful for review.)

At the end of the film, my middle son (11 yr) said, ""Dad, every school should use this in their science classes."" Of course, I agreed. But I said, ""But son, the film is 'loaded'...since it has an ID message you probably won't see it in public schools."" ""But that is just at the end!"" He replied. ""They could just show the first hour or so.""

OK. He is young. But you know, he is more right and more wrong than he knows. Anyone watching the film simply must be struck by the awesome spectacle and complexity of this SINGLE example of metamorphosis (all insects undergo it!) If I were a NeoDarwinist, I'd be terrified to show ANY part of the film. Most people will simply be overwhelmed by the sheer beauty and wonder of nature...which of course leads to some uncomfortable questions for them...

Congratulations to Illustra Media for a dazzling, and I mean truly DAZZLING film. And thank you, also, for inspiring my children. I will buy several more copies as gifts to show my gratitude.

My boys, ages 7 and 10 said this:  ""I really liked it. It was scientific. And I got to see butterflies I've never seen before. I liked learning that butterflies have 'flakes' on their wings."" The flakes are the microscopic images of the wings. I too really enjoyed the 3D imaging of what occurs inside the chrysalis. It is a true mystery of life that this film has captured using the latest technology. I learned a great deal, and I am a butterfly enthusiast. The makers of this film were clearly inspired, and now so am I. And I hope that my boys will ALWAYS remember this clear proof of intelligent design. I could tell them until I was blue in the face. But for them to see it for themselves...the microscopic egg that becomes a winged masterpiece...is priceless. We recently hatched our own butterflies, but it just was not the same. Even though we had six caterpillars become butterflies...no matter how hard we tried, we missed every one of them come out of the chrysalis.

My only complaint is that the section at the end on metamorphosis pointing to Intelligent Design was a bit too short.  I think they needed about 10-15 more minutes to make their case and let other ID leaning biologists weigh in (and yes, while in the minority, there are still plenty of ID leaning biologists).  I guess they were just trying to let the evidence speak for itself, which, of course, it does quite well.

That said, I was very pleased with this documentary overall and suspect it will appeal to a wide range of audiences.  Also, the DVD has some good extras (like a video Q&A, the music from the movie, butterfly resources, and so forth).",1311724800,14,1033,4.586956521739131
4530602,5,B0052P61WO,"This DVD is a must for biology classes. Many kinds of butterflies are featured, but the main attention is devoted to the monarch butterfly. The monarch egg is shown as a tiny, striated igloo. Fascinating facts are presented to complement the photography. For instance, was a human baby to increase in mass as many fold as a newly hatched monarch caterpillar does between hatching and pupation, it would weigh twelve tons! [Not mentioned is the fact that this is the weight of 2-3 large male elephants.]

The annual migration of monarchs to Mexico is featured. They travel thousands of miles south-southwest, some even from Canada. In what perhaps is the most stunning photography of all, the overwintering site is shown. Literally hundreds of millions of monarchs are crowded into a relatively small area. Monarchs literally fill the air. They cover branches of trees in several layers. (This helps prevent them from getting too cold during winter.)

The process of metamorphosis is described. While a pupa, the erstwhile caterpillar is not merely refurbished or completed to become a butterfly. Instead, it is largely ""taken apart"" before being reassembled as a butterfly. Much precisely timed cell death is involved.

Evolution does not have foresight, and it works by whatever favors the immediate survival of the organism and the passing on of its genes to its offspring. This is inconsistent with the emergence of metamorphosis in insects as a biological phenomenon. It could not have evolved incrementally, because there is no selective advantage whatsoever to a partially successful process. The entire complex process must work perfectly or the life of the caterpillar will not be rewarded with offspring--an instant evolutionary dead-end.

The caterpillar, in effect, commits suicide, and ends up a butterfly. Since evolution does not have foresight, how about a Designer who does have foresight, and who made the butterfly and its metamorphosis process?  The authors of this DVD are open to this possibility. Hopefully, the viewer will be also.",1310256000,6,2054,5.25

So exactly how can that contribute to its success as a species, while it waits untold years for further mutations to come along and enable it to recreate itself into a butterfly? Since caterpillars can't reproduce?
Illustra animated a set of MRI scans of the complete cycle of metamorphosis in a Monarch to create a three-dimensional depiction of the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. The amount of work that went into that effort and into the rest of the research for this report is really impressive.
Metamorphosis is a beautiful, well-researched documentary suitable for encouraging people of faith and for offering a provocative challenge to the skeptical and dismissive.",1309996800,11,938,5.431506849315069
4530604,5,B0052P61WO,"Absolutely phenomenol movie from a scientific as well as artistic perspective.  A must see for every adult and child covering the basics on one of the planets most interesting species, the butterfly.  We are all mesmorized by butterflies from an early age, by their colors, flight patterns and the wonder of how a butterfly originate and emerges from a cocoon.  The authors of this movie provide the scientific information of what transpires from the initial egg planted on a leaf to the birth of the caterpillar and the metamorphosis to a butterfly.  One amazing fact is that each specie of butterfly seeks out only one specific plant leaf for its eggs.  Another amazing fact is that the caterpillar has no sex organs yet tranforms itself into a specie that can reproduce.  The story of the 2nd or 3rd generation of the Monarch butterfly specie's migration over 2500 miles each year to pursue the new crop of milkweed as it arrives each spring is astounding.

Opening my mind and eyes and providing an awareness of something I took for granted for so many years was wonderful.  Understanding the mystery and awe of what truly transpires has left me clearly believing that a creator had a hand in this process was clearly designed and didn't just ""happen"".",1309046400,10,1256,4.809302325581395
4530605,5,B0052P61WO,"The subject of METAMORPHOSIS, butterflies, is in itself visually ravishing; the science behind their formation, clean and fascinating; the implications for the philosophy of straight, Darwinian theory, challenging. The film, slowly and steadily transports us into mystery, into the death, reorganization, and resurrection of life within the chrysalis, and we see engineering in its most marvelous and mysterious form. The film company, Illustra, obviously has as its purpose, to foster our appreciation for a universe created and intelligently designed, but in highlighting the caterpillar-to-butterfly transformation, in all of its marvel, intricacy, and spectacularly sophisticated, super-restructuring, one is pressed to admit that such transformation by Darwinian evolution, by unordered, accidental, error-based, mutational means, seems far-fetched to the point of ridiculous. As one of the scientists featured within the film signals, this kind of magnificent orchestration requires composer and conductor. It is really that simple. And in this simple, powerful rendering of mystery, from metamorphosis, to the unimaginable life-journey of the monarch, we not only experience intimations of truth, but the alluring whispers of astounding beauty.

 The photography stuns; the science instructs; the conclusions inspire. The thrust of the work strikes the ball directly into the court of the Darwinians, and the intelligent designers have come to the net. The return stroke, if there is one, promises to be fascinating. Occam's razor, the principle of selecting from competing theories, the simpler and more pristine theory, the hypothesis which makes the fewest, wild assumptions, is put quietly, but unmistakably on display in this film. A high school orchestra teacher could listen in on the undirected, instrument tuning of 50 students for a billion years and never hear Beethoven's 9th.

 If you've never truly loved butterflies before, you'll love them now. And even more, you will appreciate, more than ever, astoundingly more than ever, the beauty, mystery, and creative ingenuity of life, in all its forms. The film, truly, sings and dances. It is a work of art about a work of art.",1308268800,56,2195,5.6626139817629175
4530606,5,B0052P61WO,"Metamorphosis by Illustra Media is an educational nature film of exceptional quality about the brief life cycle of the butterfly. The film uses staggering visual footage, computer animation, magnetic resonance imaging, and succinct storytelling to bring the viewer along for an enlightening journey into one of nature's little understood but ongoing events in the insect world. This documentary film promises to provide an up-to-date understanding of what is known about the life cycle stages of the butterfly and clearly it delivers on this core point.

Included in the life cycle of the butterfly is a focus on the Monarch butterfly's annual migration from Canada to Mexico and the rain forests of Ecuador.  The ability to make this mind boggling trip by an insect that has never been to its ultimate destination is presented with viable suggestions on how it is accomplished ranging from the angle of the sun to magnetic properties of a certain volcanic mountain range.  However, it remains a mystery but an enjoyable one to ponder.  What events transpire once the Monarchs arrive are testaments to the flexibility and resiliency of this species to survive the winter in order to give life to the next generation.  The awakening of these orange and yellow hued winged beauties for their mating season in the spring seems to be more than the camera lens can take into its frame in order to do the awe-inspiring scene justice.

The computer animation is necessary in order to make corresponding visual evidence to the oral information being provided.  Furthermore, the magnetic resonance imaging and the compelling musical soundtrack add immensely to the production quality of the film.

The film's conclusion makes the case for intelligent design.  Coming to grasp with this position makes some people immediately dismiss the notion as not being worthy of consideration, makes others uncomfortable, makes others stronger in their deeply held beliefs and causes many others to consider this dilemma, which may have evaded their personal involvement in constructing their own solutions until this particular moment in their lives. Whether one is open or not open to the ""grand scheme of things"" questions swirling within Metamorphosis' portrayal of the butterfly's life cycle being either left to chance or not will probably determine one's reaction to the documentary.

Regardless of a particular viewer's stance on intelligent design, this documentary film is certainly worth the investment of one's time to watch it.  Watching the documentary will be an unforgettable experience -- one of amazement and appreciation for what this planet provides to each and every one of us to enjoy!",1308268800,36,2686,5.252336448598131
4530607,5,B0052P61WO,"Stunning! No word better describes this film than stunning.  I really enjoy the former films by this talented production company, but this one might just be the magnum opus for these guys.

Right away the film immerses the viewer into jaw dropping scenery depicting the utter grandeur and beauty of our planet.  This is accompanied with a booming and poignant soundtrack that combine to bring an expectancy of a magnificent adventure of discovery.  And the film delivers on this tacit promise.

The visual safari had us tracking the migration of monarchs numbering in the billions beginning in Canada to then land in a South American Forests where we are privileged to witness enormous trees dripping in a deluge of orange from this annual gathering.  Only the language of amazement can properly describe just how miraculous this annual event is.  To then further confounding the mind the trek takes us deep inside the chrysalis to witness the greatest miracle of all, a re-birth so to speak.  We watch as a caterpillar  utterly destroys itself only to then rebuild itself from a biological soup.  Here we see one of nature's most intriguing species empirically demonstrate a feat of remarkable self re-engineering that utterly confounds any Neo-Darwinian mechanistic hypothesis for evolution.  We could not be more amazed than if we was a car transform itself into a F15 fighter jet.

And while the butterfly depicts an intelligent origin that is intuitively obvious, it also portrays a designer who possesses unparalleled creative abilities and who chooses to paint our world with brilliance of colors to dazzle our senses for what must be one primary reason, to spoil us with gratuitous beauty to enjoy for all our days. How marvelous! The fingerprints of design are all over if we are willing to see it. I can not see how after watching this anyone will be able to deny that an intelligence was involved in making everything we see.  Thanks for making this film.",1308096000,72,1966,4.9573170731707314

Well presented (if overly dramatic - overblown music and repetitive and distracting visuals) and it answered many of my questions about the life cycle of butterflies. Then the last quarter  blindsided me with a ridiculous attack on ""Darwin"" (oversimplified and misrepresented, followed by one logical fallacy after another). It seems that the whole thing was a setup, to draw you in and then to use your sense of wonder to sneak in an attack on real science. Ah - now, I look up the director, and see he is also responsible for an end-time religious film. If you buy into the anti-Darwin meme you'll find no problem with this. But look, just because you don't understand how something works, that doesn't mean there can be no reasonable explanation for it. This is a poor excuse for a ""science"" documentary. There must be better ones out there. (And don't bother to flame me. I won't read your hateful comments.)",1504051200,,1051,4.774725274725275

8454105,5,B0052P61WO,"I've watched this video several times and show it to the residents at the Gospel Rescue Mission. The process of metamorphosis is one of those catch-22/chicken or the egg scenarios for Darwinism, just as is the origin of life via RNA World. World class prebiotic chemists, such as the late Leslie Orgel, understand the problems with the RNA World hypothesis, but press on with it anyway. Getting nucleotides to form RNA chains in water, including hydrothermal vents, is a complete bust, which is why the late Robert Shapiro in a Scientific American essay (Feb 07) suggested that energy-driven networks of small molecules gave better odds of developing into an RNA World--a little razzle-dazzle for the masses.

Metamorphosis beautifully shows the process of the butterfly lifecycle from egg to butterfly. The caterpillar stage is a completely different kind of animal than the butterfly. It is impossible to imagine how an organism evolved from a butterfly to a caterpillar stage or vice versa by a nearly infinite series of small modifications. The mature caterpillar goes into the chrysalis stage in which most of its body parts are broken down and recycled to form the butterfly. Caterpillar mouthparts, legs, digestive system, eyes, etc. transform into completely different systems to produce the butterfly. How this would've happened through a stepwise Darwinian process is a mystery, and is one of many reasons why people do not accept evolution as a viable theory.",1491609600,3,1470,5.2025316455696204
