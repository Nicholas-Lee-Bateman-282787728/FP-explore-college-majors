8064087,1,B0009OBHOK,I was very disappointed to find that Vol. 3 did not mean third in the series and was just a repackaging of the same episodes on the first DVD entitled Medic Vol. 1.  It would have been helpful to be able to access the episode information prior to purchase to avoid this type of problem.,1208217600,6,286,4.2
