As a musician who has played dances for decades but never had the opportunity to get onto the dance floor, I found I could actually begin to dance following the instruction by Nick Felix.  He starts at the beginning, and even the biggest klutz can follow him.  Each segment of specific instruction in a movement is followed by a demonstration of the step by Felix and his wife, with running commentary and repeated, then again with music, and finally demonstrated by a wedding couple in their tux and wedding dress, set to music.  This sequence for each new movement lets the learner see where each part is going: first the individual foot, arm and body movement; then the whole movement of each partner; then partners together, all with commentary to this point; then partners with music; and finally the demonstration with the wedding couple.  We viewed several videos for beginners, and this one in our opinion is the easiest to follow.  We started literally from scratch, with no experience; in one week's time, following the tape instruction and practicing every day for no more than one hour, we feel comfortable that we will be able to get out on the dance floor and not make fools of ourselves!

This video also will encourage the beginner to do more--to practice and learn new dance moves.  Nick Felix has a series of VHS tapes, and if the others are anywhere near as effective they will be terrific.",1157068800,,1447,4.714285714285714
