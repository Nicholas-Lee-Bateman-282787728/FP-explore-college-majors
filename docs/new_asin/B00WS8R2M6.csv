7151881,5,B00WS8R2M6,"The set this review was written for is the UK release of Downton Series 1-5. This is in Region 2 format and you will need a Region Free or Region 2 DVD player to play it. Also, it does not include the Christmas Special 2014 episode. The US version of this set, when it is released, will be Region 1 (USA) and will include the 2014 Christmas Special. You may well find this review attached to the US set, as that is what Amazon tend to do!

Series 5 of Downton Abbey follows the established tradition by being closely followed by the DVD set covering all the episodes to date. This includes the 42 episodes so far. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each of the others, plus the 2011 - 2013 Christmas specials of which the first was a dramatic masterpiece, but the others have struggled to reach the same heights. It was a hard act to follow! We have yet to see the 2014 Special in the UK, which is the last episode in Series 5, so regrettably it is not included in this set which has been issued before it is aired to get the Christmas sales.

The five series so far have taken us from 1912 to 1924 and an exciting ride it has been. Series 1 started just after the sinking of the Titanic and a major feature was domestic concerns such as finding suitable partners for the Downton daughters, whilst the second series took us into quite different territory as Downton was converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. This series took us on to the end of the World War in 1918. We then enjoyed the first Christmas Special Edition which was probably the strongest single episode, and featured a very dramatic trial.

Series 3 went from 1918 to 1920 as the family adjusted after the war and life returned to more as it was in Series 1. However, there were financial pressures on the estate and it was clear that it needed to adapt to survive. Some members of the family embraced change more than others. The following Christmas episode saw the Crawley family in Scotland but finished in an unexpected tragedy which cast something of a pall over Christmas Day for those in the United Kingdom who saw it on the day.

Series 4 takes us further into the 1920s and it is clear that there has been some adjustment to the boundaries between those above and below stairs in terms of the rigid division which was clear in Series 1. The Christmas Special concerns the `coming out' of Lady Rose which is a quaint English customs by which young aristocratic ladies are introduced to society. Finally Series 5 is set in 1924 just after the election of the first socialist government in the UK. Romance is very much in the air, and in rather unexpected places!

To my mind Maggie Smith as the family matriarch has been the outstanding performer throughout with her witty and caustic comments although there have been many strong performances. Hugh Bonneville (Earl Grantham), Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary) and Jim Carter (Carson) spring to mind, but to single these out is to do injustice to many others. The extra features on the individual DVDs of the individual series are also included here so there are several hours of these in addition to the screened episodes.

If you have been an avid follower of Downton Abbey since the beginning then four years on it is probably an excellent time to revisit the earlier episodes as we are currently doing. However, if you are not acquainted with the series then you really should get hold of this set. You don't know what you are missing!",1434758400,10,3497,4.5340729001584785

7151896,5,B00WS8R2M6,"My wife and I fell in love with this series during Season Five and bought this collection in order to enjoy the series from the beginning.  Having lived eight years in South Asia which had been part of the British Raj and having had household staffs, we could relate to much of the interaction with and between the staff.
Alas, the series had several defective disks.  Two defective disks in various seasons caused the video to be jerky and breaking up.  The third disk in Season Five could not be read by my DVD player.  Mercifully, through Amazon Prime and my iPad, we were able to watch episodes eight and nine.
When I contacted the seller, they quickly agreed to replace the defective disk.  I more than a little surprised when a brand new complete set arrived in the mail yesterday.  I stand in awe of this seller.",1494288000,,819,4.5

7151987,5,B00WS8R2M6,"I admit to being late to the Downton Abbey phenomenon having watched the finale but none of the prior episodes. I wanted to get an entire 6 seasons series but had to get this set and then the final season separate. I was a little reluctant to purchase this due to reviews citing missing or defective disks. I have to say that my set has proven to be intact and in good condition.

Regarding the quality of the show itself, I must say that the hype was not hyperbole. It is simply one of the best television dramas I've ever viewed. I have always been interested in period dramas whether it be Pride and Prejudice (1995 version), The Tudors, or Downton Abbey. This series was excellent regarding the drama of the family and servants featured in the series but the thing that struck me is how it left me nostalgic for a time in which I never lived. I came away thinking how nice it might be to live in that age....if you were aristocratic or at least affluent. The less fortunate did not live lives of luxury but in this show where the family is quite benevolent toward its servants and tenants they work quite hard but this family at least treat them with respect and dignity. The family as well as servants are show navigating a rapidly changing world where technology, medicine, economics, politics and social traditions and customs are all changing.....so rapidly that it must have made the people's heads spin. As the Countess says, ""we all hate change but we must learn to live with it.""  But it also was a time where manners were still important which is sadly missing in our world today. It also was a time when village life was common although many trips to the big city are featured. But the village life is as appealing as is the lifestyle and traditions of the day. I was very happy with this purchase and will re-watch it many times.",1466726400,2,1844,4.468842729970326
7151988,5,B00WS8R2M6,"I bought this as a gift for my parents because they had watched a good portion of the show but hadn't been able to see every episode

I'm quite happy with the fact that they saw nothing with a price on it, and that it arrived the next day instead of in 2! also I like the fact that it is a boxed set

7151993,5,B00WS8R2M6,"For anyone who enjoys watching upper and lower class British folk, from the early part of the last century, interact with each other in a very nice and probably totally inaccurate type of way, then this is right up your street. Unless, of course, you don't live in a street. You may live on a road or an avenue or possibly even a boulevard, but then you'd probably be French and may not want to watch a TV show about British people, in which case this may not be for you, but I think it probably is.

It's impossible not to like this show, there are actually laws against disliking it in several states across America, even LeBron James says he rushes home to see it, so he doesn't feel left out in the locker room next day when all the guys are talking about it. How much more of an endorsement do you need? The fact that the whole idea is ripped off from an earlier 70's British show called 'Upstairs Downstairs' shouldn't even enter your mind. Don't even think about it. Forget it, forget it now. If you can't forget it go and have your mind erased with a big scrubbing brush. This show is a delight to watch, and is quite possibly the edgiest, most cutting edge drama ever to appear on American television since 'Three's Company'. Though there are a lot more characters than 'Three's Company'. There's like, a thousand different characters or something. It makes Game Of Thrones look like a one-man show.

Anyway, buy this, watch it, and let yourself escape into a more simpler time. A time before suicide bombers, global warming and world recession; when the only things you had to worry about were the First World War, freezing to death in winter and the Wall Street Crash.",1465603200,,1679,4.483660130718954

The series had great acting, an amazing scrip with a great cast. We look forward to watching this series again. No need to wait for viewing on PBS or whatever streaming service may include this in it's archive. It's good enough to watch multiple times. The blue ray version looks very good. and I recommend it over the regular version which won't look as good if you have a newer LCD or 4K TV.. .",1464048000,,765,4.425531914893617

If you're smart (unlike us), you'll watch the whole series within the 30 days, and then return it for a full refund and voila! You're able to watch the first 5 seasons for free! Suck it, shoddy editing and craftsmanship! Unfortunately, we missed our window, and are now required to take turns doing dramatic readings of the last episode on Wikipedia before moving on to Season 6...which we purchased separately from a reputable provider.

P.S. TO THE PEOPLE REVIEWING ""Downton Abbey"" and not this boxed set exclusively: Go home. You're drunk and embarrassing yourself.

This series was going GREAT until 7 minutes into the very last disc, Season 5. Holy Lord, the entire thing is clip after clip of mish-mashed scenes. It's insanity. Like, every scene is there, but they're constructed together in short 30-second clips of each, in random succession.

It's borderline hilarious, if it wasn't so infuriating.

If you enjoyed the movie Memento, or any similar try-to-figure-out-where-in-which-plot-or-parallel-universe-you-are-THIS-time film, then you'll LOVE it!

If not, go elsewhere or get wasted before you get to this disc. If you can't think straight due to inebriation, the sequence might actually make sense to you.",1463097600,3,1400,5.227678571428571

It was a very well thought out series and come the new year of introducing the shorter dress as they stepped out of the long dresses. and  allowing the car to come into view what a time. Everyone felt as I did that It was terrible what happened to Matthew but by the time the end came Mary was happier than she had been in such a long time and the new husband showed her how to be happy and it's o.k. to let it be shown.

7152138,5,B00WS8R2M6,"I am not usually a person for period pieces from this era but I had heard so much about Downton Abbey that just before Season three started in USA, I watched the first three episodes of Season one on Amazon Prime.  I was hooked.  When my wife got home, I showed her the first three episodes too and she was hooked as well.  We finished the first season on Prime, then bought the Digital version of Season two and finished it the day before Season three aired.  We have eagerly awaited each season since.
I know this is a series we will watch again and again so I ordered the Season six Blu-Ray and I saw this boxed set as a suggested purchase for just $58!  PBS was selling them earlier this year for $200, so I couldn't wait.
Never have I liked a series as much as this.  The English aristocracy has always intrigued me so I have learned as well as enjoying the show.  It is a series well worth watching and as soon as the back-ordered set arrives, I will start from the beginning again to watch all the way through.  Until then however, I will the last two episodes of this season and see if I am pleased with the way the storylines are tidied up.",1456358400,2,1149,4.1909090909090905

7152148,3,B00WS8R2M6,"The problem with this set is that at least three episodes have been mis-edited for the set.  For example, in the episode where the Dowager Countess goes to visit the Russian prince, the scene has been blocked out backwards.  First we see the conversation, then we see her arriving at his rooms with her Lady's Maid, then we see her searching for his rooms.  This mistake is repeated in three other episodes and although you can make sense out of it...especially for those of us who have seen it...it's not easy.  The quality of the discs is wonderful and I believe the price very reasonable, but the editing mistakes are terribly obvious and serve to pull one out of the story at the worst possible moments.",1456012800,38,707,4.587301587301587

7152171,5,B00WS8R2M6,"What is there to say??  Downton Abbey is one of the best television series in the history of television, or even movies!

Over time we had purchased each season, and finally we gave them to our daughter who lives in Puerto Rico. So with Season 6 coming out and being the last season of the series, we purchased this set, which is seasons 1 through 5.

We purchased them the beginning of November of 2015, planning to wait until the middle of January to start watching them all over from the beginning, in preparation for watching Season six at the end.  We received season 6 the first week of February.

Two days ago, as we were watching Season 4, we realized the 3rd disc of season 4 would not play. As you can see from the photos, the disc looks perfect from the front. We flipped it over and realized it had a one inch crack all the way through which we did not see looking at it from the front.

So what do you do? We contacted Amazon who is always so excellent about replacing damaged or defective products, and they have excellent customer service. But because we held this set and waited until the middle of January to begin watching it, we passed the window of opportunity to return this set and get a replacement set.

They asked me to call them which I did, and they told me that they could not replace it because the opportunity to do so had passed.

I do understand where they are coming from, and I had provided them with these two photos that I've attached to this review, and explained why we didn't begin watching them until the middle of January, but it did not matter, and they did not replace this set.

So we had to purchase Season 4 again just replace that one disc, because this series is collectable for us. There are only a few series or movies that we actually collect, and Downton Abbey is definitely one of those.

In regards to the set itself, let me say that the picture and sound is incredible and we have thoroughly enjoyed watching these again. In a year or a year and a half from now, no doubt we will watch it again from beginning to end just a savor and enjoy this incredible series. (But I am highly disappointed in Amazon's unwillingness to replace the set because of that one cracked DVD. We did not crack it. It just came that way). But if you're looking for seasons 1 through 5, this is a beautiful set to own. (We went to the library and took out Season 4 just to watch the two episodes on disc 3, and were able to return that, and continue on to season 5 and then 6).

I highly recommend this set.",1455148800,18,2539,4.26875

7152314,5,B00WS8R2M6,"This British drama is about a fictional aristocratic family, the Crawleys, their fictional estate, Downton Abbey, and their servants in Edwardian England in the early 20th Century.  The show begins with the household awakening on a beautiful April morning in 1912, to the tragic news of the sinking of the Titanic.  The first five seasons take us through the next dozen years of life at the estate, with season 5 ending in 1924.  Like the show itself, this Blu-ray set is exceptional.
I can't recall the last time, if ever, that I've been so impressed with a television show.  The only negative is that the seasons contain less than 10 episodes each, just leaving you thirsting for more.  Not to mention, the 6th season will be the last.
Everything about this show is absolutely first rate and is, without a doubt, the finest television show I've ever seen.  The writing, the directing, the set designs, the costume designs, and most of all, the acting, are all exceptional.  Hats off to the creator and writer, Julian Fellowes, and of course, the wonderful job done by the historical advisor, Alastair Bruce.  I cannot think of another television show that has such a large cast of primary characters.  While many of the actors may be familiar to British audiences, the only ones I am familiar with are Maggie Smith and Elizabeth McGovern, yet every single one of them give tremendous, believable performances, bringing their respective characters to life, no matter how big or small the role.  The acting is done with absolute precision, making their characters feel genuinely alive.
I've enjoyed this drama so much that I've actually watched the entire five seasons, from beginning to end, three times.  While I eagerly await the release of the 6th season in January, 2016, it is also with a heavy heart because I know it will be the final season.  It just leaves me hungry for more of the trials and tribulations of these fictional characters.  It's just a shame that a quality show such as this will come to an end after 6 short seasons, while much more shallow shows run for 15 to 20 seasons.
This is fictional television at its absolute finest.  I would rate this show 10 stars, if that were possible.",1447286400,91,2208,4.761154855643045
