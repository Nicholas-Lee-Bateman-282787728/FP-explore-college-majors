8387283,3,B0031XYLW6,"I bought this movie after watching Mantan Moreland in a few Charlie Chan movies.  I really enjoyed his humor and how he added such a huge element to those movies.  This was an ok movie,  but really enjoyable.
It did have a few draw backs.  First the quality was not the greatest.  Could have been remastered for better quality.  Secondly,  while Mantan is in the movie,  i didn't feel that he played a major role in the film
Overall it was a good movie,  and well worth the price",1504483200,,479,4.292134831460674

8387288,4,B0031XYLW6,"This was a good, old-fashioned movie. I only purchased this because I love Mantan Moreland. He is up to his usual big-eyed, knee quivering antics in this film. I recommend it.",1371686400,3,175,4.67741935483871
8387289,4,B0031XYLW6,"I was introduced to Mantan Moreland while watching Charlie Chan movies. Love his brand of humor. He easily steals the scenes that he's in. This movie was no exception. I'd never heard of it before, but really enjoyed watching it. Now I'm looking for more with him in them.",1355184000,6,272,4.571428571428571
8387290,4,B0031XYLW6,"This mystery-comedy from 1940 featuring B-movie star Frankie Darro and the popeyed wonder Mantan Moreland was unseen for 70 years. Recently rediscovered, it is not exactly a classic, but a pleasant way to pass an hour.

Frankie in this film is a soda hop at a local drugstore who witnesses two murders with his pal Mantan. This leads to a lot of media attention to their small town and Frankie and Mantan try to find the real killer. Sound simplistic? Trust me, the film is far better than it sounds.

The film works with likeable characters (including the druggist, Frankie's mother, and his girlfriend played by Mary Kornman,the resident cutie pie of the Our Gang silents) and moments of genuine suspense, especially when Frankie and Mantan try to set up a sting operation. The ending (which I won't reveal here) is truly a surprise.

The relationship between Frankie and Mantan is interesting and advanced for its time. True, modern viewers may wince at one character referring to the then-thirtysomething Mantan as a ""colored boy"" and Mantan calling the clearly younger Darro ""Mr. Frankie"" when he does not work for him (such were the times). But this aisde, Mantan does not come off as a subhuman buffoon as Black characters were often portrayed at the time and a mutual respect is clearly seen between the two characters. He of the golf-ball peepers does lighten things up occasionally with his usual bug-eyed fright routines, but he plays it surprisingly straight during a good deal of the proceedings, relying more on character-based situation comedy.

This recently recovered film is not of great picture quality, but those accustomed to old Black and white films will not find it difficult to make out what's going on. Gone With the Wind it ain't, but it's good for low-budget amusement.

Most modern viewers will want to see this because of it's long lost status and Mantan Moreland's cult-popularity among fans of old films, and it doesn't disappoint on that level. However, this whets the appetite for more of Mantan's legion of now-lost films such as ""Mantan Messes Up, Professor Creeps, Mantan For Mayor, Mr. Washington Comes to Town, Up Jumped the Devil,"" etc. to be found. Film sleuths, get busy!",1270684800,23,2213,4.92225201072386
