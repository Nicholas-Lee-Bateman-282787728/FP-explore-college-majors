7364271,4,B013GCK51M,Tongue and cheek take on the zombie craze except the only infected are pre puberty kids. The special effects were pretty good with lots of gore and I don't think I will be eating any chicken nuggets soon. For those looking for a serious Zombie movie this isn't it but those that want to be entertained with humor and horror I recommend.,1442534400,,336,4.435483870967742

7364293,4,B013GCK51M,"Not for the overly sensitive types. This is a comedy horror flick where teachers get attacked by infected students and killing ensues. It is gory and completely hilarious the entire time. Rain Wilson is so incredibly funny. Other than Rainn and Elijah they didn't utilize the other actors as much even though they did have some memorable lines. There is gore, violence, and bad language.

I couldn't find information about this anywhere prior to purchase. I don't use UV, only iTunes, and to me it is misleading to advertise a ""Digital HD"" copy if it's only UV, in large part because UV movies are not actually copies at all but access to a streaming service version of the movie. I just get very annoyed when a movie advertises that it includes a ""Digital HD"" copy and doesn't specify that it's only UV. I would have liked to actually have a Digital HD copy of this movie via iTunes, and it was very annoying to see that it wasn't a ""Digital HD on whichever major service/format you use"" but UV-only. When the digital copy is specific to a single service/format, I think it should say that clearly on the packaging/description.",1496102400,,888,4.521739130434782

7364313,5,B013GCK51M,Other than lord of the rings Elijah woods makes fun exciting movies and shows And this is one of them. The thing that makes this film amazing is there's about 3 characters that are extremely unique and  Hilarious. Especially the gym teacher. And is there another movie that children get hit and people aren't crying. As long as your not super sensitive and are looking for somthing that really is different this film will be very enjoyable for you as well. This movies also enjoyable for all ages. As long as your not parents aren't total snobs.,1492905600,2,545,4.618556701030927
7364314,5,B013GCK51M,"What to say about Cooties? It's probably one of the most funniest horror comedies i ever seen. The movie somewhat appalled me at first because of certain scenes at the beginning where children are cussing towards adults which i find extremely disrespectful but i still think the movie is very creative for it's concept of zombified kids being bad guys and teachers being good guys. At times,the film can be really meta for referencing every movie imaginable and it can be gross at times with the beginning almost made me lose my appetite for chicken nuggets. With all that said, Cooties is still a unique take on the zombie genre.",1492560000,3,630,4.736363636363636

This version of Zombies isn't my fav..It is the cheaper way to go..but the story is fun and actors did a good job..I forgot how much I didn't like the tar mouth zombie effect. It took seconds of the story to come in..I am like..well I can deal with this..and I glad I kept going..because I enjoyed the movie past the cheap effects..and liked it allot.

The only real criticism that I have is that they severely underused Jack McBrayer's character. He is in the whole film, but has maybe 5 lines that aren't just transition speech.

The acting is good.  The writing is poor.  But there are a few funny moments.  The characters are silly enough to entertain.  And the child zombies are REALLY creepy.  I'd say the kids out-performed the adult cast.

Please do not buy this--like I did.  Biggest mistake.  I wish I could have that money back and buy a hamburger or a pizza.  Or just throw it into a fire.

It's also great when you find a movie with several well known or big name actors and it's clear they just did the movie for fun.  It seems like it's a somewhat low budget movie and was never meant to be a blockbuster, which is another reason I really appreciate it.  Great spin on the zombie genre.  Highly Recommend!

It's goofy, it's silly, the acting is bad, the special effects are lame and the zombies look like they had about 5 minutes of effort put into making them.

7364447,3,B013GCK51M,"I can see why people like this film. While it started off seemingly bad (see my first con), it got good. I'd sum it up as a fresh take on zombies that tried to overdo the tropes and choked on some of them.

Pros:
>Awesome child zombies. They're smart, macabre, and just plain twisted.
>Very good setup for the endgame deus ex machina that actually makes it smarter instead of cheesier. I honestly didn't see it coming, then suddenly realized how I should've seconds after it started.

Cons:
>When first introduced, I disliked Elijah Wood's character more than the P.E. coach. Ouch. Luckily, he pulled himself together into something resembling likable by the end; I'll blame the writer (oh wow that pun was not intended but works so well that I have to leave it).
>Morgan Lily's character isn't seen, at all, till nearly 40 minutes in. As she plays a random student survivor, this is ridiculous; she should've been seen in the background or something if not introduced earlier. Also, no pubescent girl would do the ""circle circle dot dot"" as anything other than a joke unless she was hysterical; besides, she wasn't even around when the infection was referred to as ""cooties"" anyways. They had plenty of opportunity to make her hysterical, but they didn't do so; in fact, they made her so level-headed I was shocked they didn't arm her during their (lampshaded) suit-up montage.
>The diabetic kid. What? Where did that come from? If that kid being diabetic was supposed to be a plot point, it should've been mentioned before the outbreak, like in the teacher's lounge. It wasn't; it just came out of left field and Allison Pill's character knew about it, magically. Whatever...
>The janitor's late appearance was barely saved by the fact that he was the janitor, making his late appearance an understandable trope, albeit mixing him with the stereotypical asian didn't help in my opinion.",1462838400,,1888,4.842105263157895
7364448,5,B013GCK51M,"Horror comedies can be hit or miss.  Some fall prey to forced slapstick trying too hard comedy, while others can sometimes choose to become strict horror halfway through.  It is a tough line to walk because of the unique nature of the genre.  I believe this film certainly hits in almost all the right places.

Much like the so often lauded Shaun of the Dead or the somewhat more recent Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, the success of a horror comedy depends on creating characters that are interesting/funny on their own.  In this case, our main character Clint (Elijah Wood) is sort of the straight man for the other characters exaggerated personalities.  In my opinion, Leigh Whannel's performance as a truly eccentric teacher stole the show and had me laughing at his every scene.

The horror elements are there - though I will admit the effects in a few places could have been a bit better or at least better executed.  Infected (read: zombified) children are running amok with devious delight and there are some well done sequences of chase and attack.  We don't entirely learn what is happening all that clearly but the origin of the infection reminds this viewer of the absurd Troma classic Poultrygeist.

If I had a complaint about the film, it would be that the ending left me wanting more.  It felt rather abrupt when the credits started rolling as I felt there was another 10 minutes to go in this story.  It wasn't a bad ending necessarily or a cheap ending but just didn't provide the kind of closure one would want - which can be the dark every dies variety or the infection is cured happy ending - but I understand they didn't want to necessarily have such resolution.

Regardless, this is a fun film made better by watching it with a group.  The humor is subtle in many cases which I appreciate because they didn't go for the broad stuff the whole time.  The plot moves along quickly and there is little downtime between horror and funny exchanges.  I am saddened that this film didn't get more exposure or good reviews upon release because it is obvious that all involved put their hearts in it and had fun making it.  I hope that will not stop them (SpectreVision) from making more quality films in the future.",1462752000,,2220,4.593908629441624

7364540,3,B013GCK51M,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

From the start I thought this movie looked interesting. The combination of various film and TV stars looking disheveled in a comedy/horror film seemed interesting to me. When I found out it involved zombies I was curious to see if they could add anything to an already overflowing genre that is near the point of running its course. It succeeds in part but not in whole.

Elijah Wood stars as Clint, a wannabe author who has left New York to return home living with his mother. Unpublished and still trying to find that great American novel in himself, he takes on a job as a teacher to support himself. This is his first day teaching in a grade school where he grew up and things start out bad as hes blocked into his parking space by an overcompensating sized pickup. Clint meets the rest of the teachers in their breakroom and finds a familiar face in Lucy (Alison Pill) who he knew back from his own school days. Lucy is currently involved with Wade (Rainn Wilson), the stereotypical jock/coach who is terrible not only at teaching but sports. It was Wades truck that blocked in Clint.

As the day progresses something happens with the kids. An infected chicken nugget (which we saw processed in a most gruesome way) has been eaten by one of the kids who then becomes a zombie from whatever ooze was leaked onto the nugget. Pandemonium ensues on the playground as first one child is bitten which begets another and another and so on. Since the outbreak only seems to infect children they adults don't change but they do have to try and stay off the kids menu. Trying to corral the children and save them the teachers fail with one exception as they barricade themselves in the school.

The film slows here as the next segment of the film deals with the teachers dealing with their own issues and those among one another. First and foremost is Wades jealousy thinking that Clint talking to Lucy is more than just a casual conversation. It could be but there hasn't been time for that to happen and it shows more of who Wade and Lucy are than Clint. When the film finally starts to move along again its because we find out not all of the children were outside.

Now the teachers must try and do two things. First is to try and save any of the parents who come to pick up their children. The second is to find a way to get out of the school and to any of their vehicles with the hope of getting the word out about whats happened. With the phone lines gone, pulled by one of the infected children, they must band together to survive.

On the whole the movie does nothing astonishing to single it out from most low budget horror films or any of the myriad of zombie films that have come out recently. If more movies like this are what we can expect then the genre will die out faster than expected. That was my thoughts while watching the film. And then something else happened.

Once the film was over and I was thinking it had had its moments (the kids on the playground scene involving gore was actually pretty inventive) but not many I began to think about the terrifying implications of this concept. As a parent and uncle I know how deeply rooted my feelings are for children. They seem so innocent. We want whats best for them. We want to protect them. And yet here we have those objects of affection, those innocents we want to protect, being the one thing that will kill us. To prevent the zombie apocalypse we need to kill the children. How horrifying is that?

In the end this wasn't a bad film but not likely one to watch repeatedly. It is worth a rental though and one that fans of zombie films will want to add to their collection.",1453334400,,3700,4.414956011730205
7364541,3,B013GCK51M,"I liked it, it's funny, and the production level is high. The acting is good, better than most ""adult"" zombie films. I think the idea of ""cooties"" was totally wasted. The boy vs girl cootie idea in grade school has been around forever and having the cooties real and fatal would have been great, but they never really develop this idea. The reason for the three stars? This movie has way too much graphic violence against kids. When the action gets really brutal it is hard to justify, even against zombie children. Seeing teachers relish in the murder of their students is just wrong. Sorry but I have a daughter and this movie was too much for me.",1453334400,,649,4.508474576271187

1.) It has made sure I will never-ever-ever eat chicken nuggets again.

2.) If you're triggered at all by violence to children, you shouldnt watch this movie. Its not a particular trigger for me, but I winced and thought Okay, little too far during some of the scenes (like where a kid is *shown* taking a hit to the head from a fire extinguisher.)

Pokes fun at Woods Hobbit role, creationism versus evolution, self-published writers,  and a couple unsubtle jibes at stereo-typed Asian behavior (Martial arts, wise words.). The lady bashing head with Cymbals was pretty epic. Not the, uh, musical instrument you were expecting to be used as a death machine.

There was only one scene that provoked a laugh out loud reaction from me, but Im a fairly choosy comedy person.

Overall, minus the random instances of them pushing the bar just a little too far, Cooties was an amusing way to spend 88 minutes, and well worth the RedBox / Amazon rental.",1451779200,,1125,4.685279187817259

I'm a big fan of horror movies and comedy movies and when the two come together it can be magical. Something like Shaun of the Dead is fantastic. I could watch it over and over again. Cooties, not so much.

The movie is made well enough and the actors do a decent enough job with what they're given. The premise, too, has potential. A zombie movie where kids are the zombies. Sure. That could work. But somewhere it all falls off the rails. Like so many movies, the trailer spoils the funniest parts. With those being taken out, the movie is forced to rely on its horror and it's simply not all that scary.

The worst thing, however, is the ending. Because there isn't one. Some stuff happens and then the credits roll, seemingly out of nowhere. This isn't a matter of leaving things open ended. Instead, it feels like a Kickstarter movie where they didn't get enough money to film the whole thing so they just made what they could, stopping 80% of the way through. I already wasn't a fan, but when you don't give me any closure at all? No thanks.

Watch Shaun of the Dead or Return of the Living Dead instead. You'll be happier.",1451433600,3,1166,4.460093896713615

7364577,5,B013GCK51M,"PLOT...
COOTIES is a horror comedy with unexpected laughs and unapologetic thrills. When a cafeteria food virus turns elementary school children into killer zombies, a group of misfit teachers must band together to escape the playground carnage and fight to survive the mayhem on the worst Monday of their lives.

This is a very surprising hit comical horror that came out of no where here in the UK, its good to see it actually got a Blu-ray release, the movie has a crazy bonkers story about a virus that infects the chicken served at the school and anyone who hasn't reached puberty yet becomes a crazy zombie freak with a taste for human flesh, thus giving us a cool and original idea for a movie, zombie children! The movie has great pace and soon gets into the action after the fun open sequence, there's plenty of bloody gory violence all done on a great looking budget, there's plenty of slapstick violence of course with the teachers defending themselves against the children, its really great fun, plenty of great gags in the right places! The cast is perfect all round, everyone adds something to the movie so its not just one character driven, even though some stars are more well known than others its a group effort, this is really worth checking out, its hip and fresh and so much more fun than you expect, one of the best horror comedies in a while!

7364581,4,B013GCK51M,Must say I liked this movie quiet a bit. If you think your getting a real serious movie then your in the wrong place. The movie is after all called Cooties that should give you a clue. It's a fun silly movie that when my son was a few years younger I could definitely see us watching together and laughing at the silliness. It does have some raw language so if you don;t like letting your kids hear that it may not be something to watch however most they have heard on cable or online. I would say watch it - it's not at all serious but how could a movie called Cooties be.....It does have some gory sense so not for the very young. Will watch again,1450828800,,649,4.078125
7364582,3,B013GCK51M,"Cooties was a brilliant idea, where after a contaminated nugget is eaten by a young school girl, she becomes infected and bites her class bully, with the desire to eat the flesh of the uninfected quickly spreading through the student body, leaving their teachers fleeing and fighting for their lives.  I'd been looking forward to seeing this one for a long time but unfortunately the idea was better than the end product.  I wasn't expecting Cooties to be so low budget in makeup and special effects in regards to the infected and killing.  One scene a kid is bludgeoned to death with a fire extinguisher but we don't even see a thing. Later we see his brain and it is totally intact as well that makes no sense. The script writing overall is pretty poor, meaning Elijah Wood and the other actors who are known for supporting roles in TV shows, come across as pretty mediocre acting.  This is also one of those films where the writers didn't really seem to know how to end it, so it just ends and credits starts to suddenly roll.

This should have been really good, unfortunately it wasn't, but like Sharknado, it might well become a must see just to see how bad it is.  It still has enough to enter you for the hour and half but nothing that's going to compel you to watch it over and over again.",1450742400,,1297,4.428571428571429

7364610,2,B013GCK51M,"It was so nice to see Elijah Wood branching out as a producer/actor in this production called ""COOTIES"". It 's a parody of the zombie genre, education system, medicated kids, food preservatives/processing as well as stereotypes of every annoying character thats in horror movies. Every aspect of the story, characters is OTT (over the top) and dumbed down. This formula is great when it works, but not so much here. I am in the minor minority that didn't really like this movie. Maybe its my age or that I am not a huge fan of this comedic formula, but if I laugh at something then its working, but I was mostly bored with the preformances and the story in general. I liked the concept a lot, but not the execution. It reminds me of the newer National Lampoon movies that are so bad.
There is a growing segment of movies that ""are so bad their good"" and I guess that this is one of them?
I didn't even chuckle when they started to fight back against the kids (big taboo) that most movies avoid at all costs. It did have a few sort of modestly humorous scenes, but not enough to make up for the rest of the time. Oh, what about that ending? was that great or what? NOT!!!
It has its fair share of cursing including ( adults and kids) the F...word and a few good scenes of blood and gore, but no nudity or sex scenes.",1449014400,,1315,4.285140562248996

Think of the dark humor of The Young Poisoner's Handbook, but in a movie that barely makes sense. I spent a lot of time saying ""what"" and ""why"". But I was never bored.

7364612,5,B013GCK51M,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I first read the plot synopsis for COOTIES, I chuckled out loud.  The title alone was enough to earn my interest, but the story sounded humorous and therefore made it a must-see.  The idea of infected kids terrorizing a group of teachers could be comedy gold if done right.  And thankfully, filmmakers Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion nail the concept squarely on the head.  COOTIES is a hilarious and unapologetic film that will having you laughing hysterically while fighting the urge to cringe.

I admit the cast of the film was a large draw for me.  Ive enjoyed Elijah Woods films for a long time, so he was a big plus.  But throwing in Rainn Wilson, Jack McBrayer, and Leigh Whannell made my funny-bone tingle.  I expected to be in for a good time, and I was not disappointed.

COOTIES is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  I had the pleasure of watching the film on Blu-ray, and the HD picture is vivid and great.

The acting, as mentioned above, is top notch with an all-star cast headlining the film.  I particularly enjoyed Jack McBrayer and Leigh Whannell in their performances.  McBrayer plays a weenie who can barely keep his wits about him, while Whannell portrays an extremely socially awkward teacher who focuses more on fitting in (even though he fails epically) than surviving.  These two are just fractions of the whole in this riotous, laugh-out-loud horror comedy.

The special effects in COOTIES look good, however they are few and far between.  The children mostly look like agitated, over-caffeinated youngsters with dirty faces.  But this is not a bad thing at allif anything, it helps elevate the humor level by making them less zombie-like and more realistic.

And speaking of humor, this film is crammed full of it.  Each character handles the chaos in a unique and laugh-inducing way, which allows the one-liners to fly.  And when things go from bad to worse, the dialogue gets funnier.  But theres plenty of tension here, too.  And when the final credits roll, youll be praying for a sequel (I know I was!).

COOTIES is a great flick, and I highly recommend it.  Brutally funny with plenty of non-politically correct humor, this film will make you look at your own kids in a different light.  And the opening credits sequence will convince you to NEVER eat another chicken nugget again.

The movie is gory but not over the top and this is the type of movie that makes you laugh at things you feel you really shouldnt be.

Hello again my obedient slaves, you are here again as commanded. In my never ending mission to give you more than you deserve I watched Cooties for you. Only these cooties don't make you itch, they make you kill. And they are spread from eating chicken nuggets, the official snack of the midwest/hell.

This is the latest and only feature film from the directing duo Jonathan Millot and Cary Murnion. Rumors persist that they may or may not be dynamic, only time will tell. They own and operate an extremely innovative media company called ""Honest"" that ""creates unconventional content in all forms"". While I deplore the name, they have a very impressive catalog of media that they have created for a wide variety of media campaigns. Yadda yadda, I'll see them in hell with the rest of you. They just filmed it, they didn't write it. And since you always need more writers than directors and more gospels than gods, there were three writers for this movie. Called Cooties. About kids that ate bad chicken nuggets. Three.

Not Murnion and Millot. But remember the early 2000s?!!

 The first of this unholy trinity is Leigh Whannel. Whannel is the brains behind Saw and Insidious. He is also the spleen behind Dead Silence and one of three suspects of the source of a foul smell in my trunk. He likes to take major rolls in his films, including this one.  He sometimes dies, which is a shame since he is one of the better horror producers/writers on the planet. The second writer is  Ian Brennan, who gave us Glee. He also has a role in this film. Don't worry, he dies early. And this one-Josh C. Waller. He produced ""A Woman Walks Home Alone At Night"" and directed one of the many short films (The Collector) in the compilation film ""Fun Size Horror"", which is available on Hulu. He also appeared in Nightmare Factory, which is a documentary. In some circles ""Nightmare Factory"" is an affectionate name given to my colon. So, two directors, three writers...onto the cast...which is just a fuckload of  talented people.

Elijah Wood- He and Waller produced this movie through ""SpectreVision"" . He plays a substitute teacher.

Rainn Wilson- all around great guy and actor, hilarious, carried the movie, go watch ""Super"".  He plays a gym teacher- do you really need to know any more? Sure you do so there's this:

Allison Pill- You might remember her from ""The Last Don part 2"". Also ""Scott Pilgrim"", which I hated, and co-produced. Because I'm from hell....but even I have to draw the line somewhere. Getting hipsters to love something terrible is no longer amusing to me..and I don't want any more of them in hell. They keep gentrifying the River Styx area.

And the rest, all comedic actors you might recognize from films and tv shows that don't suck. But they are all ultimately fodder for the conventions of this movie. The plot revolves around Wood, as an aspiring writer, Pill, as his immediate new love interest for some reason, and Wilson, who is Pill's long term boyfriend. And an entire population of prepubescent children bent on eating their flesh.

No, this is the OTHER Elijah Wood Movie where a school gets taken over
 and the non infected have to kill everyone.

So, onto the actual movie. The movie is a heavy hitting satire of the American Education System, annoying parents and their annoying children, and Food Inc. type food. It overtly mocked schooling and educators. It was clearly written and directed by people who have deep underlying neurosis and anxiety about school, and thus, it was fantastic. It was funny, and at the same time, immensely satisfying. An entire elementary school population morphs into flesh eating zombies after eating contaminated chicken nuggets. The virus only effects people who have not been through puberty- which makes the movie a perfect ""us against them"", children vs. teachers film. You get to watch kids die and you get to watch teachers and parents die. It was like a symphony of every fantasy I had when I was a young larva child. The plot device of only letting pre-puberty people be effected by the disease/plague/blessing-in-disguise was a fresh touch.

 Also, SPOILER, there is no scene where they pump the kids full of steroids and antibiotics to jump start puberty. There should of been, except this is not a movie about happy endings (how could it be, they haven't hit puberty), it's a movie about kids killing adults killing kids. Also it's funny. And not just because they kill kids, it has other jokes too!

The movie is worth renting. It won't scare you but it is entertaining. Sort of like an extended video of ""Another brick in the wall"" with a touch of zombie.

7364652,4,B013GCK51M,Good light hearted Zombie flick. It does not take itself too serious and that is its saving grace.,1445644800,,98,4.5
7364653,2,B013GCK51M,"Wow, what a movie - it has all the wrong stuff. A weak plot, weak acting, and even moments where the video when out of focus. The whole thing was out of focus I think.

So, just to let you know my preferences. Better zombie movie - Gangsters Guns & Zombies, it never went where you thought it would. Better filmed zombie movie - I Survived a Zombie Holocaust.  Funnier Zombie Movies - Sean of the Dead, and Night of the Comet. Better zombie outbreak movie with school kids - High School of the Dead.
If you don't like those movies, maybe you'll like this one.  If you liked any of those, this one won't compare.

It was about as well-crafted as a made for DisneyTV Movie. And, just like on DisneyTV, the kids are better actors than the adults. They at least really did come off as creepy. Too bad the adult actors were not as good.

So, I get it - Zombie Movies are have some social commentary, and also that the education system is ripe for parody. Yeah, sure, teachers are running scared from the little brats. But, just pushing your face in it is not that funny.  Either play it straight, or for laughs this one just didn't know what it was doing.  The adults were all just caricatures, but that is all they were.  They had all the sparking chemistry of a bottle of water. The milquetoast substitute teacher who really wants to be a writer. The ex-jock phys ed teacher. The supportive teacher, dating the jerk. The strident bitch (until things go bad, and she loses all character). The really obviously closeted gay guy.  Good for a 20 minute sketch, but to hold up a movie... not so good. Eventually he confessed that he was gay and, so what? It didn't make a difference to anything he did in the move. No one really cared, not even the macho man teacher. And, neither did I. Was that shocking turn supposed to get a chuckle in this day and age?  Better writing would have had him acting like a clich, but for it to turn out he really wasn't gay. Raj from Big Bang Theory does that so well. Much better acting, much better writing.

I can't believe Woods could not deliver in this movie! There is a scene where they are arguing about what to do, and he stops to write down an idea for his book - right in the middle or the argument. It came off so badly. Bland body language, bland facial expression, perfectly wrong for a bland joke.
And, the bit where the science teacher asked for quiet when no one was talking. Really stupid joke.
Followed by a bit where he reported that he had examined the body fluids of the teacher who had been bitten , and added don't worry, I was wearing gloves, and held up crap-covered hands. They responded with No you werent."" I responded with, ""that was stupid.""

The camera didn't vary any more than the teachers tone.  It was like watching a documentary, not a comedy or a thriller.

Highest level of funny in the move? When the tough guy sets the building on fire, and says, ""Nap time"" to the zombie kids.
Funniest thing I heard about zombies in school was when my 12 year old said, with all seriousness, ""If there was a zombie outbreak, I would run to the security desk, and look for a weapon, like a knife, or a sub-machine gun.... it's a middle school you know."" This movie is nowhere near as smart, or funny.

If you feel like just veggin' out, eating a snack and laughing at all the vicious little 4th grade monsters finally getting what's coming to them (a dream probably every elementary teacher has had once or twice before in their careers) then this movie is a good time.

7364712,5,B013GCK51M,"Within minutes of hitting play I already love this film. Its well-scored, much like some dark childrens fantasy in fact, and visually visceral for reasons having nothing to do with conventional gore. During the playfully-fonted opening credits we enjoy a serious sequence depicting a chicken factory of sorts complete with neck-breaking, rich bright colors as a fly defecates on the chicken carcass (hinted as the cooties virus introduction), limbs being clipped with sheers and separating organs while music reminiscent of child-like discovery plays in the background. From the slaughterhouse and factory, to the fryer and the elementary school cafeteria we are welcomed to Cooties with a sense of jovial adventure.
When we meet Clint (Elijah Wood; Maniac, The Faculty) and his mother (Kate Flannery), they instantly resurrect an almost resentfully nostalgic and entertaining dynamic. Poor Clint is a good-intentioned, likable loser substitute-teaching at his elementary alma mater which is now overrun with over-entitled, legally empowered kids with profanely bad attitudes. These kids are heinous and say some truly awful things (that made me laugh out loud).

A sort of viral, flesh-eating zombie outbreak ensues when a pig-tailed patient zero eats a contaminated chicken nugget and bites off a 10-yr old douchebags cheek. After opening with loads of awkward humor, the film now builds comedic inertia in the form of the most forgivably zany mayhem of violence against children accompanied by a storm of snippy quips which will draw smiles until the movies end. Why is this violence against children so acceptable? Because its completely cartoonish.

Wonderfully written by Leigh Whannell (Saw 1-3, Dead Silence, Insidious 1-3) and directed by a pair of newcomers, Cooties is as fresh as the flesh it infects. Everything about this movie is done well: the camera-work, the writing, the characters and the decisions they make, the story, the humor, the gore and the acting. I rarely get to say this about horror, but I just loved these characters. Jorge Garcia (Lost) is a joy as the drug-using crossing guard; Leigh Whannell is delightfully awkward as a socially disconnected science teacher; Alison Pill (Snowpiercer) is the sweet, unavailable love interest; and Rainn Wilson (Six Feet Under, Super) and his handlebar mustache dominate the screen as the jockish gym teacher.
Everyone had something valuable to offer! This goes doubly for the filmmakers on the other side of the camera of this film which knows exactly what it is in all the best ways. Deviating from recent horror comedies like Zombeavers (2014) or Love in the Time of Monsters (2015), Cooties delivers a high quality product whose re-watchability does not rely on alcohol; rising far above the likes of fun B-movies.

This is more than a B-movie, but falls shy of the theatrical greatness of Shaun of the Dead. We have a disembowelment-dismemberment scene that tips its hat to Dawn of the Dead (1978), Rainn Wilson goes all-state football (complete with spins, fakes, clotheslines and spins) through a horde of children, and a guy dies right after saying Follow me, I do CrossFit! The humor is sharp and abundant, right up until Rainn goes Rambo, the janitor turns out to be a Japanese martial arts master, and they medicate the ravenous kids with Ritalin and Adderall.

Its surprisingly satisfying seeing teachers kick the crap out of these kids and, just as wed want it, Rainn Wilson gets all of the most dramatic scenes. He may hog them, but he owns them. We even enjoy some jabs at the state of overly regulated workplaces, political control over teaching material, and contemporary views on cellphones in schools.

Fresh, hilarious and smartly scripted, this film was a joy. The gore, humor and story fall shy of Shaun of the Dead, but this horror comedy remains something very impressive. I was impressed. Everyone should see and enjoy this movie. Think of it as Shaun of the Deads younger brother; he shows loads of promise but hasn't fully grown up yetbut just wait until he does.",1443657600,,4060,5.117647058823529
7364713,4,B013GCK51M,"There are very few horror comedies out there that I would consider good, but Cooties somehow made its way onto that list. Unlike similar movies that may rely on physical gags, a majority of the comedy here came from the witty dialogue written by co-scribes Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious) and Ian Brennan (Glee, Scream Queens), both of whom apparently make a great team when it comes to mixing comedy and horror together.

The film revolves around a group of teachers in an elementary school, specifically Elijah Wood's character as the new substitute. It looks like he picked the wrong day to start subbing, because some tainted chicken nuggets causes an outbreak among the students, turning the spoiled brats into feral savages bent on killing off the entire teaching staff. Now they must band together and hope to discover a way out of the school without getting torn to bits. So Cooties is basically a clever take on a common theme with some comedy thrown in, and it actually works!

There was a time when killing kids was pretty taboo and though some genre pics have ventured into that territory over the years, it's still not something you see very often. While it can still be considered a little controversial to some, I think moviegoers now have grown a bit more lenient towards the theme, especially if they're zombie-esque little troublemakers like in this movie. And on that note, there's a decent amount of practical makeup and gore with very little CGI used, which is a sigh of relief, because too many horror flicks go the quick CG route nowadays.

What really stood out for me were the quirky cast of characters, each one offering something unique and funny to the table, like Rainn Wilson as the overbearing gym teacher that's not afraid to take charge and get things done or the badass Japanese janitor that takes on multiple infected kids at once with garden sheers; it's just a full set of entertaining characters that you want to make it out alive. It all works together with the hilarious dialogue, making it a pretty fun and well paced movie overall. But of course, comedy is subjective, so some may not find it as funny as I did. Also, as much as I did like the film, I just wished it wasn't all mostly taken place in the school and the ending was a bit open-ended, which I guess is fine since there are really only so many ways to end a movie like this, but it didn't really offer any closure, which would've been nice.

Overall, Cooties isn't the most original of films to come out in the genre as of late, but it sure is a lot of fun! The characters were lively and interesting, there was a decent amount of practical gore, and the dialogue was even hilarious at times. Though the ending was a little lacking and some may not find it as funny as I did, it's at least a pretty entertaining flick.",1443571200,,2822,4.571146245059288
7364714,4,B013GCK51M,"The opener of Cooties is second to one: Lord of War.  LW takes us through all the steps of making a bullet from raw metals to finished form to shipping to transportation to a battle zone, to being loaded into a rifle and fired through the skull of a young boy in Africa.  Cooties  takes us through the disgusting process of making zombie inducing chicken tenders to when it leaks a bit of green splooge when a young girl bites it.

From there on it is non-stop over the top dialogue and a plot that works perfectly and never flags for a moment.

An idiot runs the school, the teaching staff is made up of zanies; the students are the more foul-mouthed than the kids on South Park.  The plot begins at weird and ascends to crazy and beyond.

The cast is brilliant.  Its principles are pitch perfect and create comic characters who are actually nuanced. The kids are great at doing the unthinkable with a zombies glee:  using guts as a jump rope or shooting marbles with eyeballs.

All truly is not well in Fort Chicken, the home of The Fighting Chickens, but all is great for us in this refreshing take on a zombie apocalypse.

SPOILERS!

Kids using adult language, especially the 'F' word in movies, is getting really old, but COOTIES takes that a step further by requiring a 9 year-old to say the 'C' word in a classroom sequence. I'm no prude, but that is just not funny, nor is it necessary.
So I absolutely despise this kid and his sidekick from the get-go. In fact all the kids, before they become zombies, are about as endearing as pus.

A much smarter movie would have had the kids in a Mayberry-type mode, where they are mannerly little cherubs. So when they become flesh-munching zombies, the contrast of what was 'then' and what is 'now' would have been really effective.

But ""Cooties"" is not a smart movie. It is a gory mess that runs out of ideas so fast that it doesn't know what to do with itself a half-hour into it. To fill in the gaps, we have squabbles and romance among the adults and long seriously stupid sequences, like the removal of a little zombie boys brain to see what made him tick. The scene is supposed to be shocking and funny. It's neither. It is just boring.

In fact 'boring' is a great way to sum up this movie, and I was extremely bored before the first third of the film was completed. In fairness the final ten minutes does pick up the pace, and just when you think ""Cooties"" might be headed in the right direction, it implodes with a disastrously idiotic finale

""Cooties"" is one of the very worst films of the year; not to mention a slam to the talents of Elijah Wood and Rainn Wilson",1442880000,,1740,4.354938271604938

Ordinarily I HATE it when bad things happen to kids in movies, but in this case, it's so cartoonish and over-the-top, and most of the kids so deserving of the mayhem, that it was impossible not to laugh.

7364743,3,B013GCK51M,"In COOTIES, Elijah Wood plays a wannabe-writer from New York named Clint. Forced by failure to move back in with his mom (THE OFFICE's Kate Flannery in a criminally-underused cameo) in his hometown of Fort Chicken, Clint turns to substitute teaching to pick up the slack until he can finish (and hopefully sell) his horror novel about a demonic boat. On his first day on the job, he meets a bevy of kooky coworkers as well as a school full of obnoxious kids who get even more unmanageable once they eat some tainted chicken nuggets and start turning into blood-thirsty zombies.

Penned by horror-vet Leigh Wannell (SAW, INSIDIOUS), this film relies pretty heavily on its central image -- fed-up teachers clobbering pre-teens with savage abandon -- for both its horror and its comedy. It works well at the start, but when the second and third acts fail to build on the premise in any interesting way, the movie starts to drag. There are a few plot points that suggest the movie wants to be more than just a slaughterfest, including a love triangle, a microscopic subplot about how kids are over-medicated, and lots of talk about how the nugget virus works and can be stopped, but nothing comes of this. There are a few hurdles for the teachers to overcome here and there, including finding cell phones and food for a character with diabetes, but these obstacles feel like half-hearted attempts to disguise the fact that the movie doesn't know where it wants to go with itself. In fact, a conclusion never really gels, and the movie seems to end before the story does.

This is most evident in our characters, none of whom really change or grow, existing mostly as uninspired stereotypes. This is a shame, since the cast list is pretty impressive, including Rainn Wilson as a Dwight Schrute-ish gym teacher, Jack McBrayer as Jack McBrayer, Jorge Garcia as a shroom-loving security guard, and Matt Jones as an unfortunate police officer. Because none of them are asked to move the plot forward, the characters are basically one-note jokes that get repeated over and over, including Clint's pretentious obsession with his writing (in lieu of teaching his kids, he has them read his book aloud and give him notes), Jack's possible homosexuality (his lines exist primarily as double entendres), and Jorge's movie-long shroom trip. Even the love triangle that builds through the second act is quickly abandoned in favor of moving the film to a new location, not so that the story can build, but simply so we can watch the characters battle zombie kids in a new, creepier location.

It's a shame that so little work went into the writing, because so much more work clearly went into everything else. Our set pieces are pretty great, as is the music. And the cinematography is A+ quality, starting from the opening credits sequence which films chicken nuggets being made with a gorgeous sumptuousness that is at odds with its glistening nastiness. The gore, also, is plentiful and effective, even more so when you consider that much of it is sold by child actors. Unfortunately, like the bulk of its cast, the tale itself feels underfed and like it wasn't given the chance to mature into a story that's worth telling. Any opportunity to give the flick more backbone -- whether by making a point about kids and Ritalin and teachers' poor wages, or by amping the stakes with the death of a central character -- is squandered in favor of showing more bloody battles with the kids. These turn out to be decently entertaining, but -- without clear stakes or the driving tension of a good story -- they fail to be terribly interesting or memorable.",1442620800,,3633,4.791068580542265

A bit surprising that a line like that [referencing the actor's role in an outside movie] made it into the final cut of Cooties; if nothing else, you have the look on Elijah Wood's face (after hearing the word ""hobbit"") to look forward to.

Points To Consider:
 Kids running roughshod over adults makes for good entertainment.
 An appealing collection of actors. Aside from those two mentioned above, you may recognize Jorge Garcia (Hugo 'Hurley' Reyes of LOST) and Jack McBrayer (Kenneth of 30 Rock), among others. Rainn Wilson practically reverts back to his typecast (Dwight Schrute) in this role.
 The cinematography is excellent for a comedy. The title sequence alone is masterful in its grotesquery: if you eat chicken nuggets, you'll think twice after watching Cooties.
 You know how annoying those dollar slots are in vending machines? Turns out they are exponentially more annoying during a pediatric zombie apocalypse.
 Teachers are likely to appreciate Cooties on more than one level.
 Not surprisingly, Cooties capitalizes on as many horror tropes as they were able to squeeze in, including jump scares.

7364750,5,B013GCK51M,"Where to begin? Perhaps with the disclaimer that this movie might not be for everyone. The same way Wet Hot American Summer received pretty negative reviews right out of the gate from people who just ""didn't get it"", despite people like me being absolutely entertained by it, may prove to be particularly true for Cooties as well. With it's absolutely insane characters and looney toon energy regarding violence committed by and committed at children, it's a hilarious watch for anybody into absurdist comedy, though I'm not sure if it has solid mainstream appeal (which it should, but historically, I use ""mainstream"" as a kinder synonym for ""bland"" and ""uninteresting to me"").

I won't go into exact scene details, since absurdist comedy, possibly more than other types of comedy, relies on that surprise factor to keep your reaction honest and novel. Generally speaking, I found the writing to be suitably bonkers, given the ridiculous premise of a zombie outbreak where only children are affected. What starts off as a creepy, quiet movie, where awkwardness is the main driver for humor, quickly grows in energy and escalating surrealism to match the ridiculous premise until characters are basically mugging inappropriate one-liners like 80's action stars while beating up mobs of children. The movie does suffer a little due to some ""bigger picture"" stuff (which I'll talk about below). While I feel those parts can resonate with people, it does derail the ""escalation train"" a little bit and can be a tad slow at times.

The cast does an amazing job at committing to the joke whole-heartedly, despite playing characters that, with the wrong treatment, could remind you of the most cringe-worthy of Mad TV characters. Although I usually expect Elijah Wood and Rain Wilson to put in good efforts, my favorite performance was from Leigh Whannell (someone relatively unknown to me before this film) as Doug, the creepy science teacher with a few screws loose, who has several pieces of dialogue that I'm sure I'll be quoting with friends quite a bit into the future.

It's not all slapstick and horror, though. There's nice subversive through-line about how adults stereo-type ""kids these days"". The film opens as fully invested into this type of thinking, with kids swearing at their parents/teachers and being glued to their cell phones. However, once they turn psychopathic zombie, they actually begin adopting many ""old-timey"" kid habits, albeit viewed through a distorted lens. Playing marbles, putting clackers on bike tires, and playing with dollies all become horrific symbolism that maybe flat-out regression back to the ""good ol' days"" might not be what we should actually want for our kids.

Also on the more serious side, is the topic of how teachers are treated relatively poorly by society at large as being sort of a default position for those who fail elsewhere (despite how noble the endeavor of teaching children truly is). The protagonist's through-line regarding the cost of adult living and sacrificing time for their dreams just to get by (and thus having envy towards children who haven't had their's crushed yet) feels very relevant to the lives of post-college people in their late 20's and 30's, and something that I identified with very much.

In short, I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it whole-heartedly, though I acknowledge that it's not perfect and may not be to everyone's taste.",1442534400,23,3419,5.098214285714286
