2894992,5,B000T61R3Y,"I agree that polygamy is an evil and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Laurie Allen documented the life in Colorado City, Arizona about the Fundamentalist Lattery Day Saints which broke off of Mormon Church in 1890s and formed their own church which supported polygamist lifestyles. This insular locked community has the women dressed like Laura Ingalls Wilder. The women are not educated or allowed to choose their husbands. The women at an early age are forced to marry under the Prophet's orders without choice. They are never educated in the public school sense or exposed to the outside world where they are insistent that we, the gentiles, because we are not members of the FLDS church even Mormons are evil outsiders threatening their community, their family life, etc. But in reality, the men of this community should take the blame for impregnating young girls and forcing the women and children to maintain the land and do chores. The children especially the babies are held down under water when they are crying. Women are ritually abused, battered, and raped. We must put an end to polygamy in our country before we go overseas to say that women are not being treated fairly. These women are clueless to the outside world because the men have subjected them to their brainwashing. I just pray that it doesn't end like in Jonestown massacre.",1209254400,18,1373,4.871794871794871
2894993,5,B000T61R3Y,"This is a very well done, seemingly unbiased presentation of the FLSD community.  It certainly raises many issues: women's rights, child abuse, state law vs. relious belief, and the ever popular -- American Way -- aka milking the system at the expense of others.

AFter watching it twice now, I'm going to donate it to my local library in the hopes that the tragedy occurring in the FLDS camps might end and women and children will not be subjected to torture that they've been told is divine love.  The saddest part is that the generations raised in the FLDS community -- under such tight restrictions -- have no idea it seems (for the most part, except for Ruth) that they are being abused, manipulated and used.  They only know what they were born into and are told from a very young age that if you're LUCKY, you'll be chosen to be assigned to marriage, and if you're really LUCKY, it'll be to one of the honorable men in the hierarchy and if you're LUCKY, you'll have thousands of babies because that's the ticket into heaven.  If this is all you know, why wouldn't you want that?

People will obvisously do anything to get to heaven.  It's also interesting to note that many of the things that go on in the FLDS community also exist in the modern, civilized world.  (Women having babies to milk the welfare system, immigrants crossing the boarder to give bith to their ""anchor"" babies and then milking the system, healthy middle-class, able-bodied workers collecting permanent disability and milking the system.  It seems that American is the land of opportunity to milk the system.  THe American dream has become ""milk the system.""  Every young girl in a poor urban neighborhood knows that the welfare check grows with each baby.  THe illegal immigrant day workers have a great deal -- $10/hour, a ride to and from work, no need to speak the language, no performance measurements and they get a hot lunch to boot.

So it was most interesting that what started out for me as a real sorrow for the women and children (and even the men who are coerced and brainwashed like cattle), it turned into more of a political issue for me to observe this as yet another example of people milking the system.  Unfortunately, (and this is the same everywhere) the small handful of ""leaders"" enjoy the benefits brought on the backs of the masses of people who are subjugated.

I hope to see those people break away and free themselves.  HOpefully the situation at the Zion ranch will give the FLDS followers some time in the real world and realize the devil has been taking their money all these generations.",1209254400,17,2600,4.656455142231947
2894994,5,B000T61R3Y,"This film takes the viewer into Colorado City, where the largest known Polygramy group in America reside.

The photrographer was amazing in filming the area that is closed to outsiders, and shows viewers a town that is owned by the FLDS where women are treated like breeding cattle and children are denied basic education, food and clothing.

While the FLDS ""religious"" group becomes richer and richer, the women and children are forced to live under barbaric rules and regulations while surviving on government issued food stamps and disability payments.  Women and children are taught that outsiders are evil, and cannot be trusted under any circumstances.  The only education that takes place within this city is what the Profit and leaders allow, which is their way of brainwashing.

Girls are traded, sold and forced to marry whomever their fathers and/or church leaders tell them to.  They are married as young as 12, and often to very old men who rule with an iron fist.  Every visitor is watched and followed by the police force which is part of the leadership.  The producer was able to film being stopped several times by their ""police,"" and showed actual women who were brave enough speak out on camera.

In addition to the women, the sad story of boys who are killed or kicked out for minor offenses and sent into a world they are not ready for is mentioned, and groups to help those who escape are mentioned and shown.",1199923200,51,1431,4.784552845528455
2894995,5,B000T61R3Y,"This is an eye opening documentary.  It goes into detail of the abuse that women and children go through who are stuck living in the life of polygamy.  It includes interviews with escapees, including Carolyn Jessop.  It also uncovers a truth that many outsiders are unaware of, ""Bleeding the Beast"".  The men in FLDS believe in robbing American taxpayers because they are considered evil.  America spends $300,000,000 a year supporting the polygamist sect in Colorado City AZ.  The women are considered unwed, so they receive welfare, food stamps, etc.  They are forced to turn the money over to their husbands.  The husbands turn the money over to the prophet while their multiple wives and children starve and are deprived of basic necessities.  As if the physical and mental abuse that they are forced to endure wasn't enough!  This is a must-see DVD.  The United States government needs to take a stand and put an end to this horrible way of life!",1198281600,84,951,4.84472049689441
2894996,5,B000T61R3Y,"In North America, the widely-held impression of the Third World includes the idea that women's rights are non-existent and the treatment of women and children are abhorrent.  Well, this film repatriates those notions, and shows that women's rights are not always so assured in Canada or the US.

The film is a wake-up call, and also a celebration of several heroines in the struggle for the recognition and equality of women throughout our society.  The film may bring you to tears, but it leaves you with a profound sense of hope.",1194912000,20,531,4.813186813186813
2894997,5,B000T61R3Y,"Having been born five miles south of Colorado City and living here on and off most of my life, I must say that the realism and truth of the town that is reflected in this film is quite amazing.  These people have ever been the most close-mouthed and anti-social that I have EVER seen.  Under orders, they have never been allowed to speak to outsiders.  I never thought I would actually see this town exposed, but this film did a darned good job of it!!!",1194220800,47,453,4.305882352941176
2894998,5,B000T61R3Y,"This is a real documentary from someone who has lived it. It's a very rare glimpse into the secretive world that few experience.  Laurie Alan is a surviver and her film BANKING ON HEAVEN is a testimant to what she herself has lived and escaped. Polyamy is still alive throughout the new west today and this film shows the harsh truth of what happens on the inside.  It is an honest and eye opening work, and an inspiring piece of filmmaking.",1194220800,21,441,4.432098765432099
2894999,5,B000T61R3Y,"Finally, the real story about the polygamists in Colorado City, AZ. This new documentary, the only film to get inside the cult, features, among others, Carolyn Jessop. Carolyn's book, ""Escape"", just hit the NYT Bestseller list. ""Banking on Heaven"" reinforces the horrors Ms. Jessop so clearly describes.

""Banking on Heaven"" [...] will shock and sicken the viewer. How can it be possible to have the Taliban in our own back yard?",1194220800,30,429,5.042253521126761

2895001,4,B000T61R3Y,"Very good video exposing the truth about the FLDS.  The material was stretched just a bit - could have been a few minutes shorter.  Except for that - well done.  This is not an issue about religious freedom but the abuse of children in general, the sexual abuse of girls and brain washing by a charismatic leader.",1216252800,4,313,4.456140350877193
2895002,5,B000T61R3Y,"This Documentary was a little short, arount 47 minutes I believe, but was well done. The interviewer was a former FLDS member and knew her way around the town. It represented for me how controlling and isolated this town as a whole functioned. The interviews with Ruth were frightening but an eye opener.",1214784000,3,304,4.754716981132075
2895003,4,B000T61R3Y,Although it is not the most well made film (looks like something maybe a film school student would have put together) the content is very accurate and gives you a good view of what life is like with in the FLDS.,1214179200,4,211,4.170731707317073
2895004,4,B000T61R3Y,"This is not a polished publication.  Much of the film has an amateur feel to it.  There are a handful of scenes and images that are used over and over again whenever the narrator is talking about something for which they don't have specific footage.  However, this wasn't meant to be an entertaining movie so I, personally, had no problem with the quality of the footage.

There is one woman in particular who lives on the outskirts of the community in hopes of keeping track of her daughter.  Her story was particularly moving.  It is obvious from her speech that she has very little education.  If you look past that you begin to see a practical, intelligent and strong woman who had no chance to flourish.

Another interesting figure in the documentary is Carolyn Jessop.  It was interesting to hear her take on various different things that occurred before she left the community.  (I highly recommend her recently published book.  She's been actively working to provide information and support for those who choose to leave the FLDS organization.)

I recommend this particularly to those who are interested in learning about the challenges faced by those who are or have been members of the FLDS organization.  (So many people don't realize how many young men are chased out in their early teens with no understanding of the outside world!)  It is a good starting point towards gaining and understanding.",1212883200,7,1409,4.8655462184873945
2895005,4,B000T61R3Y,"This is a good start to understanding the polygamy sects and the problems they breed (pun intended).  It centers on the Warren Jeffs/Colorado City area, where the Waiting for Zion sect in Texas originated.  Great footage of real people living in the area, decent coverage of the issues, and amazing personal interviews with both men and women who have left (and one who hasn't yet).  You can really feel the very real fear and sickness that eminates from this way of life, especially as it exists today.  The financial burden on society is explored.  But there is also explanation of the huge social drain that would ensue if these sects were broken up, and the role of the current Mormon church (and their very powerful members) in protecting these sects' existance.  None of the issues are explained in depth, but it's a good overview, and I loved how the video of modern people living this way really made it real.",1211155200,5,917,4.7
2895006,5,B000T61R3Y,"Banking On Heaven is a must see introduction to the problems with the FLDS and the horrors perpetrated on women and children who are trapped in the cult.  Yes, it is a cult, as bad as the extreme Taliban and other extreme Islamic sects.

This documentary and the book by John Krakauer, ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" are excellent looks into the extreme Mormon cultists.

Since the FLDS and the Yearning For Zion compound have been in the news, and the news media have NOT been covering the cult in necessary detail, I suggest people educate themselves by purchasing this film and reading the books by Krakauer and the harrowing book by Carolyn Jessop who is featured in the documentary.

Here's an interesting tid-bit.  The sister of Warren Jeffs has a lot to say in this film.",1210723200,7,776,4.635036496350365
2895007,3,B000T61R3Y,This was a very interesting DVD. What it lacked in polish was made up for in content. I have read extensively on this topic and still learned some things. I will share it with others.,1210723200,5,183,4.257142857142857
2895008,1,B000T61R3Y,"The film's goal is to get the word out on polygamy.  Structurally, it fails to deliver.  The film is all over the place.  The through-line of the film is not clear and we don't get the basic information at the start of the film--this is necessary to get the point across.  Without a clear foundation to build on, the film does not deliver.  Footage is scarce (understandable, given the circumstances), but when used, it does not seem to correlate to what's being talked about.  It's thrown in left and right to patch interviews together and doesn't contribute visually.

If re-shot and re-edited, this film can have the intended impact.  As it stands now, the film looks to be more of a ""rough cut"" than a finished film.",1210204800,15,720,4.6141732283464565

8207954,3,B000T61R3Y,"This documentary does expose some of the horrific lives that have been imposed on individuals by the FLDS church.  Throughout the film, I kept wanting them the delve a little deeper.  I felt like there just wasn't enough first-hand views or insider access of the compound.  I do comprehend the danger and legality associated with attempting to get this information documented, however the crime in Johannesburg was filmed first hand.  I feel the film makers just didn't want to assume the risk associated with making a really great documentary.",1315785600,,544,5.078651685393258
8207955,5,B000T61R3Y,"This is a MUST SEE.  Hear the stories as told by victims of FLDS....what really went on, and still goes on today.  Warren Jeff's trial  in Texas (8/2011), is not about religious persecution, and don't let people fool you into believing that BS.  It's about prosecuting a pedophile who gets off raping his young 12 & 14 year old brides.  Don't get me started.....it's also about welfare fraud, not educating children , casting off young boys  from the compound (ages 14&15) due to competition for young girls and lastly, marrying off young girls (12&14) to either 1st cousins or 80+year old men !!!  Utah, Colorado and Arizona have let this go on far too long.",1312761600,5,659,4.678260869565217
8207956,4,B000T61R3Y,"This is an ongoing scandal that everyone in America should know about.  Six women and two men tell their first-hand stories of life in Colorado City and Hildale, the twin towns in Arizona (pop. 10,000).  There, for many generations, isolation, fundamentalist religion, polygamy, forced teen and pre-teen marriages, child and spousal rape and other abuse, inbreeding and birth defects (an estimated 80% of the community are descended from two men), ignorance, enforced poverty--even starvation--and welfare fraud have reigned supreme and unchallenged. Three government representatives and a journalist tell how frustrating it is to try to get a handle on the situation: Few or none in the community will speak against their abusers (no one is supposed to have contact with people from the outside), and the only successful convictions have been for welfare fraud. A crowd of ""lost boys,"" kicked out of the community in their early teens and left on city streets to survive however they can, meet to share their experiences, encourage each other, and find informal ""dads."" Author and researcher Jon Krakauer vouches for their stories. The filmmaker, herself an escapee from the virtual prison of the twin towns, asks: America spends billions trying to free Afghani women from the grip of the Taliban. But, here are the American Taliban, right in Arizona. Who will come to the defense of these innocent people? Who will save the women and children of Colorado City and Hildale?
I give the documentary one star less than perfect because the musical score is distracting and too much use is made of the same footage. (This is understandable, because it had to be filmed in secret, very quickly.  CC/H is a dangerous place to be an outsider.) However, the message is so strong and so valuable that I'd still recommend the film to everybody in this country.",1235433600,4,1850,5.059016393442623

I have just watched Dot Reidelbach's and Laurie Allen's documentary on the FLDS sect in Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah with shock and outrage. I thought I had seen everything when I read Jon Krakauer's ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" and Carolyn Jessop's ""Escape"", but they pale in comparison to the cruelty and abuse women right here in America are enduring at the hands of misguided and, in cases, perverted men.

Interviews with escapees, exiles, lost boys, women who have been victims of incest, who have lost their children and have endured tragedy at which we recoil in horror, makes this must viewing. Here you will discover abuse in the name of religion, elected officials turning their backs on these women's cries for help, the Mormon Church profiting from payoffs by the very well-heeled FLDS sect.

Film footage takes the viewer on a journey to northern Arizona where polygamist men live like potentates in houses worth millions, but whose wives and children lack the bare necessities of life and who are made to go on welfare at the taxpayers' expense. Here, young teenage boys are thrust out into the world to fend for themselves with only the clothes on their backs. Why? Because there are not enough young women to go around for the older men who have been taught they need a minimum of three wives to attain heaven.

Banking on Heaven reveals the corruption in the FLDS, a corruption that extends to a polygamous law enforcement and higher.

This film will anger you, disturb you, maybe make you cry, but it should be required viewing so more people can see a tragedy occurring right here in the United States.",1221177600,6,1786,5.1875
