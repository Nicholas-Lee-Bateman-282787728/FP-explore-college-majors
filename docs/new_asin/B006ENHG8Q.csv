4984546,3,B006ENHG8Q,"This DVD looks interesting but I am a bit hard of hearing. It would be helpful if Amazon had put that information in the description area of the DVD, and would let me and others who are also hard of hearing, know whether to buy this DVD or not but I don't see any information about close captioning or not in the description. If it does not have close captions, I won't buy it. Thank you to anyone who is willing to give me this information so I can decide to buy or not. Sorry I don't have a review, but if the DVD set has close captions I would buy it and do a review after I see the DVD.",1355270400,2,590,3.884297520661157
4984547,5,B006ENHG8Q,"Anyone who is fascinated with the Titanic disaster will want to own this
DVD package.  While it may not be the ""complete"" story, it is really a valuable
documentary.  It has been re-issued in 2011 by A&E as a 2 disc DVD collection.

Basically you have at least three documentaries in one package here.  The first
begins with the history of the White Star line and the shipbuilders who
constructed the Titanic and her two sister ships.  This is a lot of great
background information.  Next comes a lengthy exposition on the formation
and migration of icebergs, focused on why they traveled so far south that year,
and why the Titanic wasn't expecting trouble.

The third documentary begins with a detailed analysis of some structural problems
that existed with the Titanic and her sister ships--some of which the builders
recognized and tried to correct; others were not corrected, either because the
degree of risk wasn't properly appreciated at the time, or the decision was made
financially that the risk-benefit ratio of re-doing the ship's design would not
be economical or practical.  It must be kept in mind, as the documentary points out,
that a ship of this size had never been built before, so even though these were
master shipbuilders, certain technical problems arose that they had not encountered before.
National Geographic mounted an expedition in the Mediterranean to examine the wreck
of the third of the sister ships, the Brittania, just to see if her construction may have
corrected at least one of the flaws that remained in the Titanic, in light of its sinking
(the Brittania was still in construction at that time, so there was still time to make a
modification which might have significantly lengthened the ship's lifespan, if she were
maimed in the way the Titanic was).  Unfortunately, that documentary ends without the divers
being able to answer the question.

Overall the best parts of the documentary were the details about the White Star Line
and the shipbuilders, and a number of interviews with survivors (all deceased now,
so there will be no further interviews with them).  Portions of these interviews
you may have seen elsewhere, but longer excerpts are preserved in these documentaries.

The film ""A Night to Remember"", though only semi-documentary in nature (it is a
re-enactment of the tragedy, done in black and white) is the best movie ever
done about the Titanic disaster.  In addition to being quite accurate in almost all
respects, it has a wonderful commeentary track by 3 commentators who really DO
seem to know EVERYTHING there is to know about all things Titanic.  If you have
the Criterion Collection version of ""A Night to Remember"" and you have
""Titanic: The Complete Story"", you should have a very comprehensive video collection
indeed, about this historic event that still resonates today.  As one commentator put it,
it was perhaps the sinking of the Titanic that truly brought the end of an era (not
the outbreak of World War I a few years later)--the end of an era of naive hubris, of
the belief that our science and our technology could overcome any problems with which
mankind might be faced...",1347235200,23,3152,4.920754716981132

4984550,5,B006ENHG8Q,This is a great DVD. Saw it many years ago and never forgotten how detailed it was. True Titanic enthusiasts should appreciate this version. DVD was delivered promptly and in great condition.,1344297600,,191,5.0
4984551,5,B006ENHG8Q,"I've seen numerous programs on the Titanic. Yet, each time I'm still struck by the enormity of the tragedy, hoping it doesn't sink, and regretting the many decisions that led to the ultimate loss of about 1,500 lives.

Regardless, this DVD program's first disc is one of the best I've seen. I didn't know that J.P. Morgan owned the White Star Line - lucky for him he missed the first voyage. The net worth of its passengers was $500 million, and the best first-class suites cost $4,300 - about $100,000 today. About 14,000 workers toiled to build both the Titanic and Olympia at Belfast. The Titanic had 29 boilers and carried 660 tons of coal - think of all the hard work involved in keeping it steaming!

Had the Titanic simply run straight into the berg (only damage for first two compartments, maybe three - still float), or at least not tried to slow down (would have turned faster), experts believe it would have been saved. It took Captain Smith about 30 minutes to send an SOS, even longer to fire the distress rockets. Seems like most of the top officers didn't really believe the ship would sink, even after hitting the iceberg. Captain Smith, despite his 40 years of seafaring experience, had no prior experience with hitting an iceberg or abandoning ship - this slowed his reactions; he seemed 'shell-shocked.'

The first boats were only 1/3 full; testimony was that they had been tested with 60 men in Belfast and could have carried even more - especially lighter women and children. Yet, on average, they carried less than 40 each - very poor leadership on Captain Smith's part. (Also his sailing near full speed in an ice field - the flat sea also prevented waves from forming at the iceberg's base, making them more visible.) The 'Californian' was an estimated 10 miles away, an hour at most, yet never responded until the following morning. It's radio operator had gone to bed. Horribly, the third-class were largely locked below or held back by stewards.

There were innumerable examples of heroism - the Titanic's band playing on to the end, the ship's officers, those working below decks to keep the generators operating, Mrs. Strauss' leaving the lifeboat to remain with her husband, etc.

Those in New York didn't believe what had happened at first; 30,000 waited on the dock for the Carpathia. One scene - Titanic's berth, was especially sad, showing instead its 20 lifeboats brought back by the Carpathia. South Hampton, where most of the crew had been hired, lost 549 men.

It took until 1985 for the Titanic to be located. The 'good news' is that the Titanic's sinking immediately led to all ships carrying enough lifeboats for everyone on board, and regulations requiring full-time Marconi operation.

The second disc, unfortunately, was a major disappointment. Repetitive to the point of aggravation, it should have been summarized in 15 minutes instead of taking 1.5 hours. A firm did a computer analysis of stresses on the Titanic as if rose in the air - I don't know what that proved, absent analysis of design/material strength. They also found the expansion join design on the Titanic was problematic, and changed on the actual Britannic sister ship. However, there were two other important changes not mentioned in the program - a double hull along the engine and boiler rooms, and raising six of the watertight bulkheads up to B Deck. It sank in 1916 after hitting a mine.",1339977600,19,3407,4.8136752136752134

4984560,5,B006ENHG8Q,"As of this writing, I have only seen the first two in this set: Death of a Dream and The Legend Lives On, but these alone are the best documentaries on the subject of Titanic that I've ever seen.  Most of the others I've viewed, usually on TV while growing up in the '70s and '80s, give the basic outline of the tragedy but treat the subject like a history book- telling the story at arm's length.  Just enough to get the point across but leaving out most of the emotional aspects of the disaster.  Not so with these.

It puts you right into it.  You are there, in 1912 witnessing the elation of the passengers and the public as she sets sail into eternity.  You learn the names of many who were on board, both passengers and crew, survivors and victims.  You learn of some of their backgrounds and hopes and dreams.  And you learn of the gut-wrenching decisions that had to be made as to who would and who wouldn't be allowed into a lifeboat.  It also puts you right there, witnessing the sinking through the eyes of those who survived...and didn't.  And the aftermath, the false hopes and reports that loved ones were safe, the public demanding answers from newspapers and White Star.

I don't often get moved to tears watching documentaries, but I did with these.  It really hits home and makes you realize the enormous impact this tragedy had on society at the time, and the emotional aspect stayed with me long after I finished watching.  The musical soundtrack of these is also moving...very haunting and beautiful.",1462320000,,1521,4.547794117647059

4984584,4,B006ENHG8Q,"I wasn't sure what to expect on this two disc set, but was pleasantly  surprised with the programs.  The first disc is in the 4 x 3 format
but the picture quality was excellent; even the vintage films looked good.  The first disc I believe was made back in the 1990s and
deals mainly with interviews with the surviving travelers plus a good long look at the events that led up to the sinking.  The second
disc deals more with the ship itself and possibly faults in its design and construction.  Happy to say the conclusions was though
there may have been a weakness in the expansion joint designs (improved greatly on the Britannic) that apparently had little to do
with the accident.  It seems that an unfortunate series of incidents happening at the wrong times probably caused the sinking.  The
producers said in conclusion that the ship was sound and should have survived but for a few oddly timed events.  Anyhow,
for the time the ship was quite well made.  I wonder if welding, which was still in its primitive state, would made a difference if the
plates were welded along with the rivets.  The film said at the time there were some ships that were welded together but split
apart horribly; I think perhaps discouraging the weld method for the time being.  The second disc was in the 16 & 9 format and
I watched it on my HD computer monitor but could not expand the frame to fit the 16 & 9 monitor screen.  But the picture was
beautiful and very enjoyable.  For those interested in Titanicology, I recommend watching A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, dated from
the late 1950s but surprisingly accurate and with believable sets closely based on the Titanic's interior.  The FOX version TITANIC
made a few years ago is worth watching only if you want to  see a very accurate view of the ships interior and exterior.  Otherwise
don't bother; I thought the story, especially about the idiotic jewel, was awful.  The mush story was ok, but not historical. Anyhow,
I thought this set of DVDs was excellent and well worth the price.  I got this and some other Titanic stuff from Amazon.  And no
Dr Sweets in any of the programs...Thank goodness!!  Enjoy.",1410220800,3,2142,4.586842105263158

4984605,3,B006ENHG8Q,"Titanic The Complete Story, 2012 film

The newly launched `Titanic' was hit a glancing blow by an iceberg in April 1912 and soon sank. The steel plates were loosened so water leaked into her hull. It had been advertised as ""unsinkable"". Over 1,500 souls were lost because the ship did not have enough lifeboats. These two DVDs have three programs with about 5 hours of playing time.

Death of a Dream. This uses old newsreels, interviews with survivors, and old pictures to tell the story. The 19th century scientific opinion of constant progress was shown to be an assumption. JP Morgan created the ""International Mercantile Marine"" trust which consolidated several shipping lines. There was competition for transporting passengers from Britain to America. The White Star line wanted larger, more spacious ships for this traffic. Big ships needed new equipment for their construction. Some docks weren't big enough for them. This ship was designed with compartments that could be blocked off in case of leaks. A lot of the crew were new and not used to this new big ship. Steerage contained immigrants bound for a new land. Hazardous ice flows were seen. Were they going too fast for conditions? Complacency? Another ship halted due to the ice. The rents in the hull let in water that did more damage than the design allowed for! The radio sent a call for help. They started to place women and children in the lifeboats. Some boats allowed men. Distress rockets were fired. The ship settled in the water, the bow beneath and the stern above water.

The Legend Lives On. Distress calls were sent by radio. The `Carpathian' steered towards the `Titanic'. First reports in the press said all were saved; this was soon corrected. The survivors described the sinking. Those in the water called for help, the cold water killed them. There was some space in the lifeboats, a few were saved by the overturned collapsible boats. The `Carpathian' arrived in the morning to rescue the survivors then returned to New York city. The deaths of fathers left families destitute. One of the survivors was vilified. The `Californian' was blamed for not coming sooner. Later a ship went to pick up the hundreds of bodies floating at sea. Other ships soon increased their lifeboats and life-rafts for every person on board. The US Senate held hearings on this disaster. No negligence was found. Ships would carry wireless sets all the time, working 24 hours a day. There were other changes. In 1985 they found the site of the `Titanic'. Debris surrounded the wreck. Some artifacts have been recoverd.

Titanic's Achilles Heel. This story investigates the flaws in the Titanic's design. [No mention about construction.] Was there a cover-up? What caused the sinking ship to break in half? The `Britannic' was its sister ship, sunk in 1916. Was the steel hull strong enough? They sent an expedition to the `Britannic' in the Aegean Sea to inspect her expansion joints. Was there a difference? Yes, one to prevent a crack in the notch. They calculated that the extra stress may have caused the ship to break in half. There was cracking in the `Olympic' after years of service. Any new design can have unknown flaws.

Watching these movies reminds me how a book can better document many of the events shown here.",1355616000,3,3289,4.887096774193548

8496874,5,B006ENHG8Q,This is a wonderful story of the ill-fated ship. It starts at its birth and culminates with the history of the after effects and the finding of the wreckage. A great documentary. I highly recommend it,1496707200,,200,4.583333333333333
8496875,5,B006ENHG8Q,"Saw this on the A&E network 20 years ago and loved it! So glad I found it here! This show is old enough that all the new data regarding the wreck isn't in there, but also old enough that they had interviews with actual survivors, instead of voice overs. A lot of neat stuff for anyone that is interested in the story of Titanic.",1494460800,2,328,4.140625
8496876,5,B006ENHG8Q,"Oh I loved this set. It does compliment my original THX DVD set of TITANIC (1997). The stories here are very informative and I liked the narrator from the History Channel that does this program. He has a wonderful voice to do these documentaries. There are 3 good documentaries here in this set on 2 DVDs. The product descriptions/editorial reviews above on the DVD are pretty specific, but the times are longer.

If you are a fan of the movie and it's many versions before the 1997 James Cameron one, I think you owe it to yourself to get this set. It is well done and the quality is quite good. I have many History Channel DVDs and all of them are wonderful in quality. They will look good on the UHD TVs. I have a 55"" UHD 4K and it looks great. No problems with sound, either. So, find a good deal where you can, you may want to try a good used Book and DVD place before buying online. Just a suggestion. You may save a few bucks.
