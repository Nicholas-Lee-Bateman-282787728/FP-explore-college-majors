8365660,1,B002DP0J56,These cd's were too boring for my 4 yr old grandson.  Too much talking and not enough action.  He compared all that I bought with his crunch/tear cd from mighty machines and they didn't even come close to action watching.,1401494400,,221,4.5
8365661,4,B002DP0J56,"If you have a little boy (or girl) that loves machinery and construction equipment, these are movies for them! We own a couple other of the Mighty Machine DVDs and my 2 year old loves them.  Lots of live action shots of actual equipment at work and cute little voice overs for the machines themselves.",1303430400,,301,4.472727272727273
