985117,5,6305171769,This is the best horror movie ever made and Michael Myers delivers his best and so does Jamie lee curtis. This halloween is the best than all of the others!,914889600,,156,4.233333333333333
985118,4,6305171769,"Jamie Lee Curtis is a MOVIE QUEEN. She truly shows Michael who is boss. I have never seen any of the previous Halloween movies - but I will after seeing this one! A Must SEE!!! ALTHOUGH, it took a while for the movie to  get going...and once it did - it went too fast!!!",914716800,,270,4.0
985119,4,6305171769,"Halloween H20 is the first Halloween film since the first to include Jamie Lee  Curtis and her character of Laurie Strode. This extra addition to the film, adding emotional touches to the plot, automatically makes it an  above-average film.  Yet what I liked about H20 was the way in which it was  not trying to be as clever or as funny as Scream, but rather merely  attempted to bring the old, classic style of horror back to the  movies.....no sophistication necessary. What results is a very scary film  with more jumps than  in any other horror film, and a Michael Myers that  seems much more realistic and less ""robotic"" than in Halloween  parts 4, 5 and 6. Michael Myers kicks serious arse, while violence is by no  means tame.  In fact, numerous horror references also show a degree of  intelligence to this film.",912643200,,820,4.65034965034965

985194,1,6305171769,"I'll make it simple.  This is supposed to be a horror film, yet it lacks the most important component in any good horror flick:  An eerie atmosphere.  Bad acting, bad script, bad setting and a bad story.  No suspense to speak of.  I enjoy good camp.  I loved the first SIX.. yes that's right SIX Friday the 13th films.  They had bad acting but were campy fun and Jason was a great villain.  Well... Mikey Myers was good in parts 1,2 & 4..  I enjoyed part three quite a bit even though it had nothing to do with Myers.  This movie?  This movie is a complete waste of time.  Even ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was better.  That about says it all.  Trash.",1509062400,,656,4.144
985195,5,6305171769,"Classic! Recall watching this as a teenager for the first time at a drive-in theater, lying on the top of my parents station-wagon.

985197,5,6305171769,"Halloween, Laurie Strode and Micheal Myers.  What's not to love?  The only thing that annoys me, and that's not just with this movie but with many of them, is that the protagonist is on the highest possible alert, well armed and looking in every direction and somehow either the antagonist or someone harmless manages to approach them so closely that they could literally lick them and they don't see them.  That's just a personal pet peeve with pretty much any horror movie.  Other than that, this is as good as any movie.  The acting is well done and it's not too dark to see the bad guy and/or what's happening.",1508198400,2,614,4.545454545454546
985198,4,6305171769,"Another great Halloween movie but, the end kinda sucked. Too abrupt and she should have said something else like, "" It stops here Michael"". Or something like that. Still a good movie. Jamie Lee is great.",1508112000,2,203,4.666666666666667

985201,1,6305171769,"I never liked the first Halloween and this one was not believable. If it's horror, then I can understand all the victims and gore. But no human is tough enough to take so many blows, knife cuts and survive to go on a killing rampage, again. I suppose one star is for Jamie Curtis' acting, because she can scream really well.",1507680000,,324,4.327868852459017
985202,4,6305171769,"An updated take on Halloween that retcons the cult nonsense of the prior two films and puts the focus back on the Myers family, where it belongs. It's unfortunate that part 4 also got retconned, as that was a pretty good film, but 5 and 6 made it necessary. Lots of nice callbacks to the original film, the kills are much more graphic and in tune with a more modern audience, and Curtis shines. It isn't the classic that the original film was, it doesn't break any new ground, but it's good for what it is- an old school slasher film set in the 90s.",1507507200,2,549,4.238095238095238

985227,3,6305171769,"Not as good as I remember back in 1998. It's very short with absolutely no story or surprises (except maybe the last shot). Also, I never noticed how awful Myers mask is and that it's actually CGI'd in one shot. What? This movie has so much potential but blew it in my opinion.",1507161600,,277,4.245283018867925

985298,5,6305171769,"I don't give a crap about aspect ratios or none of that technical stuff, that's for the guys that sit there and measure every pixel like it matters.
For me, H20 was all about the movie and the return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the part that made her famous.
I think they could've ended the franchise right here and it would've been okay with me, as decapitation was the sure way to end Michael's reign of terror.
Resurrection was a bit of a disappointment as they turned Michael's death into some insane plot twist about him attacking a paramedic and crushing his larynx so he couldn't talk and switched clothes with him so inevitably, Jamie ends up being charged......
But that's a review for THAT movie.
If they had ended Halloween after ][ and then made this one 20 years later, it would've worked GREAT but such as it was, it couldn't be that way.
All in all, this is an essential film to the franchise and not to be missed.",1478476800,,924,4.377906976744186

985478,4,6305171769,"Twenty years later, having completely ignored every Halloween following number two, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now one of the undead, having miraculously survived a killer car crash and the lost of a daughter never mentioned again!!!  In this alternate universe, Strode is the headmistress of Hillcrest Academy.  She is the mother of a snotty son (Josh Hartnett as John).  She drinks too much and pops too many pills and jumps at stray reflections that remind her of brother Michael.  Naturally, Michael conveniently tracks her down and with relative ease, gains access to the school she works at.  What follows is a perfunctory killing spree, leaving just a few bodies in his wake.  He's old, he's slowing down.

Short and to the point, having the novelty of Laurie Strode return is almost enough to elevate this above the subsequent movies that were abruptly made null and void with this entry.  Almost.",1445558400,,914,4.967105263157895

You don't even mind when some die because you have no attachment to anyone. Not even Curtis' character. It's not even a movie like The Faculty, which is dumb, but fun, dumb entertainment.

985697,4,6305171769,"Maybe it was or maybe it wasn't a good idea to ignore the events in 4-6. Things started off promising and then went downhill after part 5. Part 4 ended with Jamie Lloyd killing leading us to believe that she was going to be like Michael Myers but instead she has some psychic link with her uncle and practically a mute throughout the film. Having Michael cry in one scene sort of made the character weak and the two idiot cops with the silly music playing made it worse. Then part 6 took years to come out because of the studio re doing the film, re writing the script, and not have Danielle Harris to return as Jamie Lloyd as well as killing off the character instead of leaving her as the star like the other films. The producer's cut of the film was better than that mess made on the theatrical version which pretty much hurt the franchise until it started off fresh with H20. I admit 4-6 made Michael into Jason Vorhees like crushing skulls with his bare hands and using whatever weapon he could find. He was better off as John Carpenter called him an unstoppable force of nature rather than a killing machine being controlled by a cult. People could label the Halloween series as a trilogy with part 1, 2, and H20 which makes some sense and the way the film ended should have been it. We can all ignore Resurrection due to the fact it was ridiculous having Michael in some reality show and a paramedic having his head chopped off instead of Myers was dumb to begin with. Still H20 is good and suspenseful with a few elements from the first two films connecting all three nicely. I wish there was an extended cut of the film with the extra footage that's shown only on FX.",1417651200,2,1676,4.357827476038339

985817,3,6305171769,"I must admit, when I saw this movie in
theaters for the first tme back in 1998, I was very confused.  Upon viewing it, I did
not realize there was a deliberate move to
completely ignore and disclude all the events of Halloween 4-6.  I realize some hardcore Halloween fans appreciated this decision; however, I remain torn.

While I was dissappointed with the final product of Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, I am a very big fan of the Jamie Lloyd character from parts 4 & 5 (portrayed by Danielle Harris).  After I discovered that Jamie's character, the young surviving daughter of Laurie Strode, was essentially wiped out of existence for the purposes of this next installment, this movie and new story did not gain any points with me.  Later on, I found out that there were initial attempts during the earlier script writing phases to try and
connect the events of 4-6 and to also acknowledge the Jamie Lloyd character inside this movie.  However, Jamie Lee Curtis herself was actually an advocate
against it as she thought it would cast her character in a bad light.  I guess I do see her point on that.  After all, what good mother would leave one child behind but keep the other one with her?  However, with that said, if we are able to suspend some disbelief that a form of Michael is alive and well to stalk his sister once again after a ravaging fire consummed his entire body in pt. 2 (and in the absence of a Thorn-Druid cult plot, which the seeds for pt. 6 came from pt. 2, to explain his evil and immortality), then there is a way to suspend some disbelief for an explanation in which Laurie believed her daughter to have been dead before she went into hiding.  H2O already establishes a car accident and then going into hiding right after it.  This could have been an actual accident where she believed her daughter to have died and then she fled with whom ever from her family was left.  Granted, motivation would have been key, so reference to the cult aspects would need to remain intact as a reason for Jamie's
survival being kept hidden from her mother.  We already know that the Thorn cult wanted and needed her for its purposes as alluded to in pt. 6.  These people could have been anybody in Haddonfield so it works as a possible & passable explanation.  I do realize, though, therein lies a problem for the fans who were turned off to the Thorn roots from the previous sequels.  But I could have lived with it if it kept Jamie's existence connected to this installment and my main point here was to demonstrate that the absence of Laurie's daughter in H2O did not have to be because of intentional abandonment.

Personally, I think what I found the most appealing about this movie was the return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.  Without that draw, I likely would not have bothered beyond one viewing.  I thought this movie gave us realistic insight into what became of Laurie and her life following the traumatic events of her brother trying to kill her all those years ago. Her alcoholism, her overprotective nature concerning her son (which I feel would have made even more sense if they kept the Jamie connection in and Laurie eventually found out her real fate), and even her skittish or avoidance tendencies surrounding Halloween are all highlights of what became of this character 20 years down the line.  I also liked the build up to
the moment when she and Michael finally come face to face again.  The one on one confrontations towards the end where she finally decides to face her monster and take him on were also good.

There are some who say that this movie's ending could have served as a fitting ending to the overall series.  I actually agree with that opinion.  I liked the parallel between the ending scene with Michael reaching out to Laurie to the scene of Jamie reaching out for Michael in pt. 5.  There was a brief glimpse of the humanity aspect both times.  The main difference being where the the climax to Jamie running again is inevitable, the climax with Laurie is her finally putting an end to it.

What turned me off in the movie was definitely the SCREAM movie style and its overtones.  I liked SCREAM for what it was at its time but I did not need to feel any homage being paid to it while watching a
Halloween movie.

Also, while Halloween 6 is one of my least favorite sequels (mainly from how they brought closure to the Jamie character and how they hacked up the story between the producer's cut to the final
cut), I have to honestly say I can buy that
time gap of 3 years between 1995-1998 when it comes to H2O.  But with pts. 4-6 disconnected to this movie, we are now talking about a 20 year time gap that Michael was doing what exactly before coming to the conclusion out of a clear
blue sky that his sister was still alive somewhere?  At least if the other parts had been connected to H2O, I could buy he was pre-occupied most of that in his coma before time tracking Jamie down
and being with the cult.  Then in the lapsing 3 years maybe trying to track the baby down with no luck.

I did like the cameo for the nurse, Marianne Chambers, but definitely felt the absence of Dr. Loomis (aka. Donald Pleasence RIP).

I was also not a fan of the Michael Myers mask for this movie and I thought the actor portraying him was a bit small as well.

The teenaged characters were okay but their overall involvement was for when Michael was ready to strike and kill.  Not much character build up in the way for most of them.

Overall, if you are a fan of the Laurie Strode character, and story, this movie is worth checking out.  I find it better than pt. 6 and Halloween: Resurrection, by far, but the first two movies and pts. 4 & 5 still remain my favorites.  In addition to Jamie, Laurie, and Dr. Loomis being my favorite protagonist characters of the series, these movies just have the setting that make me feel like it is actually Halloween.  So I like to pretend that the Thorn trilogy, as it is referred to, connects with this installment to the franchise.  Although, I would not mind pretending pt. 6 never happened and events in Haddonfield ended with pt. 5.

In the end, to each his or her own.  In conclusion, I think there are elements to this movie to be enjoyed whether you are a fan that considers this pt. 3 to the first two or even if you are a fan, like me, who prefers to watch like all the sequels happened before this one.

I disregard mentioning Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, as that installment is
truly a stand alone movie with its own plotand all story that is void of Michael
Myers.

While I was

disappointed with the final product of

So when I came to find out that her existence was pretty much wiped out for the purposes of this new film, the new story did not score any points with me there.  However, later on, I did come to find out that there were attempts earlier on in the script writing phase to include connections to 4-6 and to acknowledge the Jamie character. It was apparently Jamie Lee Curtis herself who was a strong advocate against any inclusion of those previous sequels and the daughter character, as it would stand to cast her own character in a bad light.  Which, I guess I can understand her point there on that one, what good mother would leave one child behind but keep the other one with her?  Still, I say that if we can suspend disbelief that there is still a body walking around in the form of Michael Myers after that ravaging fire in part 2 virtually consummed his body (and in the absence of a Thorn-Drui cult
storyline, hich part 2 actually laid those seeds for part 6, explaining the evil &
immortality of Michael), I think we could
have suspended some disbelief for a
passing story in which Laurie truly
believed her daughter to have been dead
as a result of a real car accident they
experienced.  Then, Laurie could have
gone right into hiding after it with whom
ever was left of her family. The car
accident and faking her death is already addressed in this movie.

985821,4,6305171769,"When it comes to horror cinema, Hollywood keeps on flogging that dead horse like nobody's business, churning out sad sequels often with diminishing results. Only, once in a while, a horror sequel unexpectedly strikes a chord with the audience and dents the box office. Such was so with 1998's Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. This one had some things going for it. As a nod to its 20th anniversary, it brought back its original protagonist, scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis. In the wake of the subversive Scream films, it stepped up its game by injecting a sense of self-awareness, though it had nothing on the meta mojo delivered by the Scream films or even by 1994's Freddy's New Nightmare, a sequel that also returned its original protagonist, Heather Langenkamp (who plays herself), to the fold. But I liked H20 very much.

Maybe a few SPOILERS now.

Taking a page from Scream, H20 gives us a pre-credit sequence that gets our juices flowing. Not sure why Michael Myers waited twenty years to pick up his sister's trail. Maybe he's got this overblown flair for the dramatic? But you wonder what he'd been up to all this time. (My guess: chef at Benihana's or door-to-door cutlery salesman.) The film opens up in Langdon, Illinois as dead Dr. Loomis's former nurse arrives at her burgled home. Confoundinng our expectations, she does everything right. She gets the ef out of there. She calls the cops. She makes sure she's not alone. She waits outside with someone while someone else checks out her home. None of that does any good. And the Shape has got what he's sought: his sister's address.

In Summer Glen, northern California, Laurie Strode (Curtis) is divorced and raising a 17-year-old son on her own. As resilient as ever, Laurie as lived a life. Years ago, she'd faked her death and changed her identity. As ""Keri Tate"" she's the headmistress of a secluded private school. Oh, but the little things. She's overprotective of her son, John (Josh Hartnett, making his debut). She drinks and pops pills and frets a lot and still looks over her shoulder. But, today, not even the solace offered by her school counselor beau (Adam Arkin) can lower her stress. It's Halloween today.

She and John are feuding. John's had it with her stranglehold on him. He's the only one who knows her true past, but he thinks she's tweaking too much. His argument is that if his deranged uncle hadn't come for them in twenty years, what makes today different? She just refuses to give him permission to go on the school's camping trip to Yosemite. But then John realizes that a near deserted campus is the ideal venue for some alone time with his girl (Michelle Williams) and a few friends. Oh, you poor dumb kids.

It's still mostly standard slasher flick fare. It still honors plenty of slasher tropes. But it's made really watchable by Jamie Lee Curtis's presence. Her character just resonates, man. She's like Ripley in the Alien franchise, that one strong connective tissue. More on her later. I thought LL Cool J was good in his bit part as a campus security guard with aspirations to writing trashy romance novels. He not only shows off his likable side but he upends that clich about the black guy in horror films. I don't know that the kids added anything noteworthy to the movie; they did provide us with a few gruesome kill scenes (that dumbwaiter scene, oy!). Adam Arkin's school counselor is the calming voice of reason, but I bet he would've traded that for Dr. Loomis's expertise on deviant psychology.

I dig the wink-of-the-eye vibe. There are these touches of irony. I love the bit where a cameoing Janet Leigh - star of Psycho and Curtis's real-life mom - drives away in a Ford cruiser, the same car that Marion Crane drove in Psycho five decades ago! It's a nice balancing act, because these sly nudges aren't so prevalent that they undermine the impact of the horror elements. The Shape himself, and never mind that he still has that William Shatner mask, remains an utterly terrifying, unstoppable force of nature. Which makes Laurie Strode's final stand against him so meaningful. Watching the amazing final 15 minutes, a showdown that is savagely gratifying, I think those parallels between this scene and Ripley's face-off with the alien queen are on point. Laurie Strode is just as badass.

Closing points of frustration (and maybe SPOILERS):

- LL Cool J's preventing Laurie from finishing off Michael; LL thought he was doing the right thing, but, still, I couldn't help yelling at the screen
- This one really bugged me: While fleeing from Michael, Laurie stupidly heaves a drawer of kitchen knives to the floor and then gets on her knees and, from that position, picks up the knives scattered on the floor and throws them at Michael. WTF?",1413676800,,4754,4.767922235722965

985854,1,6305171769,"Where to start. Despite my fondness for Jamie Lee Curtis...this movie is just plain weak. First off this film completely ignores the plot lines established in Halloween 4,5, & 6. I grew up with the Halloween films, and I loved them, but to write off 3 films because Jamie Lee decided to return (presumably for a hefty paycheck) was asinine. Secondly, much of the film is shot during the day, including some of the kill scenes with Michael. Not a good idea. Also, though it may seem like a moot point, Michael's mask is horridly bad and ends up just looking weird rather than chilling. The saddest part of this whole affair is that H2O could have been brilliant. Imagine Laurie having to deal with the fact that Myers had killed her daughter (pt 6) that she abandoned (in a sense). This could have made for one hell of a study in psychological guilt and depression. Instead H2O ends up falling woefully short of expectations. I've always wondered what I would say if I met Jamie Lee Curtis and she asked my thoughts on H2O (yes I'm aware this will never happen). I would try to be polite, but I would absolutely say it was a mistake to ignore the 3 other Myers films that had continued the Strode family plot line. A big mistake. Not to mention the other aforementioned flaws in the film. H2O is a terrible attempt to recreate magic. The worst part is it could have been a triumph if done properly. A wonderful example of how bringing back your marquee star for a film series of this type can exceed expectations is Wes Craven's ""A New Nightmare"". Proof positive that this sort of thing can be done. Sadly H2O fails on this front, and it fails badly.",1407888000,2,1649,4.4635761589403975

985965,3,6305171769,"""Halloween H20"" is a fun entry into the series, and goes a long way in making Michael scary again. Over the previous 3 sequels, Michael lost his stalking menace, and where ""Halloween"" kind of laid out the blueprint for slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" to follow, ""Halloween 4, 5, & 6"" seems to throw what made the original such a classic and began copying the imitators the original story spawned. Michael became more like a Jason Voorhees type killer (which isn't a bad thing), but lost what made him so original.

As ""H20"" opens we meet Dr. Loomis' old nurse last seen in ""Halloween II"". She arrives home one evening to find someone has broken into her home and searched through some old files Dr. Loomis kept regarding Laurie Strode. We soon learn that Laurie faked her death hoping to escape from Michael and has moved to California...and that Michael now knows this as well.

Laurie Strode, now living under an alias, and working as a headmistress of a private school is trying to piece together a normal life. With a 17-year old son, she is beginning to unravel as Halloween approaches. She's seeing her murderous brother in mirrors, and through windows and is convinced Michael is coming back for her. Her son and his friends decide to have a Halloween bash on school grounds when most of the students will be leaving for a camping trip. Hiding away from his mom and the security guard, the foursome soon light every candle available, and proceed to party like it's 1999...(er..1998?). It's not long before Uncle Mike shows up and the blood begins to flow.

""H20"" does a really good job of building suspense, much like the first two films in this series. If you're looking for a high body cound, this isn't the entry for you. Like the original film, the scares are all about the build and Michael's appearance towards the end of the film.

If you are hoping to learn more about the Thorn cult, Jamie's baby or any of the elements featured in the previous three sequels, forget it. This is the 3rd time they decided to hit the re-set button on this series and there is no reference to the events of the previous three films.....which is kind of a good thing.

""H20"" has some really good perfomances, and the cast consists of known actors unlike the previous films. I really liked that Janet Leigh get a prolonged cameo, and the references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-1960/dp/B000ICXQXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (1960)</a>&nbsp;are scattered throughout the film.

The big issue I had with ""H20"" is that by relocating the series to California, we lose that Halloween season vibe. No trick or treaters or jack-o-latern's on porches. This film could be taking place in April or June, and I miss Haddonfield.

Definately worth a rental, even if you checked out of this series after part 2, this was a really good attempt to get the series back on track.",1382659200,,2924,4.871227364185111

986019,2,6305171769,"Halloween severly now went downhill (past redemption?) when they had the lame brained idea to create THIS movie.

 Let us count the ways this movie reeked:

 One was the teen bopper cast -- Some could actually act but that wasn't the point. It pisses me off when horror film producers cast teen idols just to rake in the dough and teen audiences. All characters portrayed were stereotypical, senseless splatter fodder we care NOTHING about. Most moves they do are either stupid or may as well been read out loud in a rule book. Obvious moves = less suspense.

 Jamie Lee Curtis was a saving role. It was great to see her again but her personality was a bit ho-hum. Thankfully she acts convincingly even if her character is a little flaky. The relationship she had with her son Josh was realistic, and the tension they had flying on screen could be felt in the air. LL Cool J Makes a debut as the funny security guard -- he can act but should have kept his ass out of this movie. I don't have any wish to see humurous side characters inserted into a film JUST to make people laugh. At least Janet Leigh had a small cameo.

 The setting is a school where Laurie (with her name change of course) is a teacher. That did make sense because of how she was in High School. Apparently she had faked her own death certificate. How the hell did ol' Mike find her?? We are never given an explanation.

 Michael also seems to be getting his ass majorly kicked lately. The ending is a cool enough confrontation but nothing dynamic was blended in. All females seem to be there for the male eyes, and the males for the quick and easy kills.

 John Carpenters score was heard very briefly but the main music from Marco Beltrami is too close to the ""scream"" score for comfort.

 Kevin Williamson was asked to write the script and did an outline. But the end result was croped up by Robert Cappia and Matt Greenberg. So any blame cannot fall on just Williamson, as I have seen it commonly done. Some of his ideas that were tossed out of the window actually were good. Producer is none other than Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2, 3, House)

 Thankfully some thrills were suspensful but they quickly fell flat and the gore was watered. It seemed the movie was chocked full of shocks designed simply to obtain oohs and aahs from the audience in a theatre. Not my idea of horror.

 In the end it seems Myers has been cheapened and possibly castrated.",1379635200,,2427,4.427927927927928
986020,4,6305171769,"Halloween H2O is a good movie, not just because Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, but because it has a believable story, good setting, and solid acting. In this movie, Laurie is haunted by memories of Michael Myers, and is fearful that he may return to kill her. Laurie shows her vulnerability by becoming an alcoholic while trying to cope with her demons. She has since moved far away (northern California) but that doesn't stop Michael from finding and stalking her. This movie still has the same brand of suspense, chills, and fright that the first movie became known for.

This movie pretends like none of the other sequels existed, and brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode.  It is revealed she faked her death after Halloween II and has been living in hiding ever since.  She is the Head Mistress at a private school and has a 17 year old son.  Michael discovers her location by tracking down the nurse from Halloween I and II (in a cameo role that likely would have gone to Donald Pleasence had he not passed away), and tries to finish the job he started 20 years ago.

The things I like about the movie is that they made the character of Laurie a strong heroine figure.  She never bought that he was dead.  While she did still drop the knife a couple times she did end up picking up an axe. The entire set up to their coming face to face (in a great scene) was her realizing she would have to confront him and not just run away.  The movie also paid nice homage to the late Donald Pleasence in the beginning even having a voice over from the original movie.  You really can look at this movie as creating a Halloween Trilogy.  While I did not dislike Halloween IV and V, and would had been fine if they incorporated some of that story in as well, Halloween VI and VIII are better left ignored.

986090,4,6305171769,"""Halloween: H20"" is an almost perfect ""end"" to the Halloween Saga. I'll state why it is almost perfect at the conclusion of my review.
  Apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis had the idea to do a 20th Anniversary Halloween film because she wanted resolution for her character, original ""Halloween"" heroine Laurie Strode.  That is an inspired idea.  ""H20"" sensibly ignores/disregards the events of ""Halloween  IV, V, and VI""  (Great-- because I never bothered with those sequels, anyway). ""H20"" brings everything back full-circle by bringing everything back to Laurie.  The original working title of this film was ""Halloween 7: The Revenge Of Laurie Strode.""  Laurie may have survived the original murder massacre of her ""brother"" Michael Myers (which comprise the original ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II""), but she is, in many ways, a psychological and physical mess. In order to escape the terror of Michael Myers, Laurie faked her own death. Living under the new name of Keri Tate, she had a son named John (Josh Hartnett) and became a teacher at the exclusive and private Hillcrest Academy in California. She is also a ""functional alcoholic"", using several medications to help with her re-occurring nightmares of Michael Myers. As a mother, she is overprotective and paranoid, and John is growing tired of acting as his ""mother's keeper."" To be whole and free again, Laurie must battle Michael Myers on Halloween, 1998-- exactly 20 years after the original nightmare began.
  ""H20"" functions successfully as a homage to other films; most specifically the original ""Halloween"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960), the classic horror film that inspired IT. A classmate tells John that if he remains so attached to his mother, he will end up running a deserted hotel off some deserted highway-- a direct reference to ""Psycho."" Janet Leigh, mother of Jamie Lee Curtis and star of ""Psycho"", has a small role as Laurie's secretary. We even see Leigh with the original car she famously drove in ""Psycho."" Recalling the original ""Halloween"", it is especially nice to see  Nancy Stephens briefly reprise her role as nurse Marion Chambers from ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II."" It is mentioned that Chambers was the devoted assistant and care-taker to Dr. Sam Loomis ( the late Donald Plesence) who pursued Michael Myers throughout ""Halloween I, II, IV, V, and VI."" Chambers' discovery that Michael Myers has broken into her home and stolen the private file on Laurie Strode sets the plot of ""H20"" in motion. When John's girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams) asks why his family does not celebrate Halloween, he casually answers, ""We have a serial killer in our family who kills people on Halloween."" Of course, Michael Myers does show up at Hillcreast Academy for some 20th Anniversary murders. But, like the original ""Halloween"", the emphasis in ""H20"" is on suspense instead of graphic murders, so the body count is surprisingly low.
  The climax/resolution between Laurie and Michael Myers is enormously satisfying; both dramatically and psychologically. It is an almost perfect ""end"" to the ""Halloween Saga""; meaning that THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ""THE END."" But somebody came up with ""Halloween: Resurrection"", which negates everything in ""H20"". But, as ""H20"" ignores/disregards ""Halloween IV, V, and V"", simply ignore the ""Resurrection"" and let ""H20"" be the perfect end to the Halloween series.
  The Dimension Collector's Series DVD features a Behind The Scenes Featurette, a ""Halloween Trivia Game"", and a Music Video.",1354060800,6,3505,5.2450805008944545

986092,3,6305171769,"This review is for the Echo Bridge single-feature DVD release of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.

First off, I strongly prefer H20 to all of the other sequels - so much so that I actually only really like three films in the series - Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H20. The beauty of H20 is that it ignores the increasingly bizarre and unbelievable events of Halloween 3-6 and brings the focus back to the series' original protagonist, Laurie Strode, played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis. Smart, modern (even today), and full of plenty of shocks and surprises, Jamie Lee proves why she is the ultimate Final Girl of the horror genre.

When Disney and Miramax parted ways, home video distribution of their film titles became very scattered. Most of the studio's prestige titles like the original Scream trilogy, The Others, Chicago, and others are handled by Lionsgate entertainment, and the content of the home video re-releases generally remains the same as their original releases from Disney. Anchor Bay has released some titles too, including Scream 4. A good amount of titles, however, have been licensed to budget company Echo Bridge, which has been a well-known company among the $5 WalMart bin and $1 DVD rack aficionados for a long time now. These days, Echo Bridge and Mill Creek are branching out beyond the public domain fare and licensing more titles from major studios to varying results.

I had actually bought a 4-movie set called Masters Of Terror from Echo Bridge featuring four horror sequels from Dimension Films that included H20 for $5 at a local grocery store that was packaged with Echo Bridge's DVD of From Dusk Till Dawn. All four films, as is typical for the company, are squeezed onto a single dual-layer disc. Despite compression, most films in the set are watchable, but H20 had a very choppy laggy feel during motion. Felt like a badly encoded AVI file one would have downloaded off a torrent. Not to mention each film only has four chapters.

When I came on here and saw that the standalone DVD was $2, I figured it might be worth it, and hoped it'd be better, and it was. The motion is definitely smoother on this disc, and Echo Bridge is far more generous with the chapter stops, giving the film 15 of them this time. Other issues remain, such as dirt, specks, DNR, MPEG2 general issues, etc. And yes, it's not the theatrical aspect ratio - it's been opened up (NOT cropped) to 16:9. While I'd rather have the original 2.35:1 composition, I'm ok with this as no information is lost AND it's anamorphic, which is the one advantage this disc has over the original disc from Disney. Audio is 2.0, but I only have a 2-speaker setup so I'm ok with this, but since the film IS mixed in 5.1, it'd only make sense for them to use that. And one does wish subtitles were available, as well as the bonus materials from the previous DVD.

I'd recommend spending $4-$5 at the most for this DVD, which has a list price of $6.99. The film could stand a better disc, both SD and HD, from a bigger company like Lionsgate, which would have at the least retained previous bonus materials, the 5.1 audio mix, 2.35:1 composition, and offered subtitles. But for a few bucks, it's not a bad purchase. For $2, I'm happy with this disc.",1353196800,,3252,4.648695652173913
986093,4,6305171769,"Halloween H20 is a decent slasher flick, and the seventh in the Halloween series overall.  It's intended to be a direct sequel to ""Halloween II."" It is an effective capstone to a makeshift trilogy of films focusing on Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie Strode.  Slasher fans might be annoyed that it ignores parts 4 - 6 of this series, but if they are willing to take the film on its own merits it still has a lot to offer.  The story pays loving tribute to the original film, casting and performances are well above average for the genre, and the emphasis is on suspense rather than gore.  The film has a few drawbacks, though - it is far too short, the musical score is borderline terrible, and The Shape's mask seems to change from shot to shot throughout the film.

Amazon.com's HD presentation (viewed on Halloween 2012) is very good.  Unlike the blu-ray issued by Echo Bridge, the picture is presented at its proper aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and detail is much improved.  The image is still a little dark, and some specks of debris are visible on the print.  Overall, though, its a satisfying presentation.  I didn't have any problems with the audio - dialogue was clear and the soundtrack was not overbearing.  Hopefully, this HD presentation will become the basis for a new blu ray issue.",1352160000,2,1294,4.635964912280702

Now the headmistress of a private school, Laurie Strode (Curtis) is still struggling with the horrifying, 20-year-old memories of the maniacal killer Michael Myers...when he suddenly reappears with a vengeance.

Laurie's rebellious son (Josh Hartnett, 30 Days of Night), his girlfriend (Michelle Williams)and the school security guard (LL Cool J, TVs NCIS: Los Angeles) will become Michael's newest victims unless Laurie can conquer her greatest fears and put evil in its place once and for all.

The time has come again for you to experience the frightening fun of Halloween the motion picture series that totally redefined terror.

This 7th installment of the HALLOWEEN film series is set in an alternative timeline in which the events of HALLOWEEN 4-THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS, HALLOWEEN 5-THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS, and HALLOWEEN 6-THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS never occured and continues directly from HALLOWEEN I and 2.

HALLOWEEN H20 is set 20 years later after the horrific events in the original HALLOWEEN centering on a post-traumatic Laurie living in fear of her ghoulish mass murdering hellbent brother Michael Myers who maliciously murdered 16 people on Halloween night of 1978 attempting to kill her all those years, but when Michael eventually appears on Halloween night of 1998, Laurie is forced to face evil one last time whilst the life of her teenage son John Tate(Josh Hartnett) hangs in the balance.

Meanwhile back in the fictional midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween Eve of 1998; the now deceased Dr. Loomis's colleague Marion Chambers(Nancy Stephens)gets killed off after a brief confrontation with Michael Myers(Christopher Durand) when she discovers she's been burglarized and ransacked in search for Laurie's file and discovers that Laurie is still alive and has relocated to a small fictional town in Northern California called Summer Glen to start a new life with a new identity.

Then on Halloween Day of 1998; this flick reveals to us that Laurie had faked her death and is now living under the alias of Keri Tate who seemingly had a perfect life with a son, a boyfriend named Will(Adam Arkin), and a great career as headmistress at a private boarding school called Hillcrest Academy High School, but the tragic ordeal from 20 years ago still continue to haunt her & adversely affect her parental capabilities, yet to everyone else including her school secretary Norma Watson(Janet Leigh), it's just another Halloween day, but Laurie still continues to live in constant fear from the attacks back in the Fall of 1978 & partially believes Michael is still alive & will eventually return and finally find her one day while Michael is already stalking the school grounds & eventually Michael & Laurie come face-to-face again for the first time since their last encounter 20 years ago, except this time they have a fight to the finish on Halloween night of 1998.

HALLOWEEN H20 was also the last film to have Jamie Lee Curtis co-star with her late great mother(Janet Leigh)too along with the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis & Janet Leigh had previously co-starred together in John Carpenter's THE FOG back in the Winter of 1980 too.

Something else I found intriguing was John Carpenter(Director of HALLOWEEN I)was originally in the running to be the director for HALLOWEEN H20 since Curtis wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original HALLOWEEN to have more active involvement in it, but since Carpenter's starting fee was $10 million dollars, the job was given to Steve Miner from the director of HOUSE, FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2, and FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 instead.",1341878400,2,3778,5.07085346215781

986142,3,6305171769,"John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a solid and creative classic that stole many ideas and techniques (such as camera angle = killers' point of view) from Bob Clark's masterpiece, ""Black Christmas"".  Halloween 2 was a barely decent movie followed by lousy sequels (that weren't really sequels at all).  Halloween H20 received positive and strong reviews seemingly because fans were so grateful and relieved that after 20 years . . . there was finally a ""Halloween"" titled flick that had some resemblance to the original.  H20 is a slightly above average horror movie with an interesting premise and a some humor mostly by casting Janet Leigh.  No doubt H20 would have been greatly enhanced if John Carpenter had directed.  Here's some of why this film didn't cut the mustard:

The absence of logic is insulting to the intelligent viewer:  Laurie Strode supposedly faked her death 20 years ago and has now assumed the alias of Keri Tate in order to hide herself from her brother.  This makes for a fairly implausible script.

Characters are (extremely) much less interesting than the original.

Suspense scenes do not build enough and are therefore less than stellar.

Some scenes such as when the keys dropped were downright silly and annoying.

Decapitation scene simply didn't look real.

The soundtrack is disappointing and doesn't really help the movie.

Michael's mask and eyes were less scary than earlier movies.

Michael could have been killed by repeatedly bashing in his head with a rock.  Instead the young lady just gives him one quick crack to the noggin and runs.",1319673600,,1573,5.015444015444015

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a teacher at a private school and has a son! But every night she is relived by the haunting memory of the Halloween night twenty years ago and now that her nightmare has returned she must make a choice... run, or fight back!

Review: With its $17 million budget Steve Miner (Director of Lake Placid/Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3D/Day of the Dead (2008)/ and This Movie), Robert Zappia (Writer for this Movie) and Matt Greenberg (Also a Writer for this movie) came up with a story that does the original justice and creates a great balance between hostility and hospitality! Although I do wish they explored Laurie Strode's foster family let alone her real family in the movies before creating this one... although I do appreciate Part 6 for revisiting Laurie Strode's foster family! A big flaw I found in this one though was the scene with Michael starring at the kid and it shows his ""Eye"" but in part two you see both his eyes shot and the eye in part seven looks totally intact! It was a superb addition to the Halloween franchise though and I don't think they could get any better than this except none of the sequels have anything on the original and can never measure up!

Acting: It's got solid actors, LL Cool J, Jamie Lee Curtis and many more and everyone did great in with there acting skills! I never felt like it had bad moments of dialogue either! Everything is in order about this movie and I love that!

Gore: multiple stabbings, a gross broken leg, two slit throats, a cleat to the face, and an infamous decapitation! it had its moments and when they came they were violent!

Bottom Line: $76 million was made from this movie (Including rentals) and it is one of the most successful Halloween movies of the series! It had great acting, some good blood and gore scenes, a great idea for a plot, and I adore the fact that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is so bad-ass in this one... even more than Michael Myers!

Rated: R for terror violence/gore, and language

Now living under a pseudonym and with a teenage son, nightmares continue to haunt her. Unbeknownst to Laurie, Michael is on his way to first what he started twenty years ago.
Halloween: H20 is presented in a less than stellar video presentation. First up the video is presented in 1.78:1 aspect ratio instead of the film's original 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  This does not necessarily mean that we see less of the film as the film is presented in open matte format. The definition is better than DVD technology and upscale technology, but Echo Bridge could have done a better job with the transfer. Overall the video is lacking, but not totally disappointing. Nothing stands out when you watch this film. The blue on Janet Leigh's car is acceptable as all greens in the shrubbery surrounding the school. Once again no blu-ray or blu ray that I have seen is inferior to the DVD. Overall H20 scores 3 and half pumpkins out of 5.
The audio is another tricky feature of this blu-ray release.  Halloween: H20 sports a DTS-HD MA 2.0 lossless soundtrack. This is not most dynamic soundtrack out there, but not the worse. In no means am I defending this choice of soundtrack. The film stays mainly on the center position and for a movie like H20, which is not the worst thing in the world. I would be more visibly upset if this was Die Hard or Jurassic Park. Overall H20 scores two pumpkins out of five.
There are no special features so I have no choice but score this section a zero.  Halloween: H20 is the second best sequel in the original Halloween series. The movie is a well paced horror movie that horror fans and fans of this series will thoroughly enjoy. The acting is sound, the suspense and horror is on target, and direction is sound.

986253,3,6305171769,"About the Blu-Ray release:

Echo Bridge Home Entertainment acquired a number of Miramax titles in the sale (they were split between them and Lionsgate), which I was excited about. We would be getting forgotten genre pictures like this on Blu-Ray at reasonable prices. I for one like ""Halloween: H20 - 20 Years Later"" and was looking forward to the release. What I am confused about is, like everyone else, the way Echo Bridge is treating the films they are releasing. The picture quality isn't horrible on this release. In fact it's the best the film has ever looked on home video. Moreover this is the first anamorphic transfer the film has seen, which is great. BUT for a reason I can't even fathom Echo Bridge has decided to crop the sides of the frame (harkening back to the nightmare that was Pan & Scan) and force the film (which was shot in 2.35:1) into the new HDTV 'fullscreen' aspect ratio (1.78:1). This is totally uncalled for, especially in todays day and age. Things like this shouldn't even be happening. BUT the release is a catch 22 when it comes to the picture quality. Like I said, the image we do get is rather crisp, so you will get a nice (not excellent, mind you) transfer if you do purchase it. Unfortunately, you will be loosing picture due to the cropping. Plus, if you are stuck with the old Miramax DVD, watching it on your HDTV is going to be horrible, since it's a non-anamorphic transfer. Still, you will still want to hang onto that DVD if you are a fan of the film because none of that Collector's Edition's special features are ported over to the Blu-Ray. I am going to go ahead and recommend this release only if you are a die hard fan of the ""Halloween"" series, because in that case, you will get nice picture quality. If you are a stickler for the technical presentation as a whole, stay far, far away from these Echo Bridge releases.

About the film:

""Halloween: H20 - 20 Years Later"" is the true part 3 to the Michael Myers saga. The many films to feature the character (they number 10 in total) are mostly nonsense, but at least this picture actually tries to accomplish something. Brining back Laurie (a good Jamie Lee Curtis) into the mix was the correct thing to do. In fact, they even make the character believable. I like everything they did with the story here but unfortunately it's far too little. The film barely runs 80 minutes rendering the interesting aspects of the story vague. But against it's own sabotage it strangely succeeds. It may not be deep but it's brisk and fun and it's nice to see a conclusion to the Michael and Laurie story. (Ignore every wretched sequel besides this one.)

3. The audio is pathetic. You don't even get surround sound. You get a pitiful DTS 2.0 Stereo track. The DVD at least offered us a 5.1 mix. I thought Blu-ray Disc was supposed to be an upgrade from DVD?

986256,4,6305171769,"After the huge success of Halloween (1978), John Carpenter and Debra Hill didn't want to make a sequel that had Michael Myers in it.  The first Halloween movie was supposed to be the end of Michael Myers appearing in Halloween movies.  But......they were pressured into making a sequel that had Michael Myers in it.  So, they reluctantly gave us Halloween II (1981).

After Michael Myers burned to death in Halloween II, it was meant to signal the end of the Michael Myers saga for good.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill decided they wanted to take the Halloween franchise into a new direction by making a Halloween-themed movie every year, each with a completely different storyline.  So, they gave us the refreshing and severely underrated Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982).  This movie didn't have Michael Myers in it (I'm so glad).  Well, all the Michael Myers fanatics freaked out when he wasn't in Halloween III.  They gave the movie poor ratings.  Carpenter and Hill then decided to abandon the franchise altogether.  That is a shame, because it would have been a great thing to see them make a new Halloween-themed movie every year, each with a different story and no Michael Myers.  Fast forward to 1988.  Time to cash in on Michael Myers for many reasons (see my review of Halloween III - Season Of The Witch).  We got Halloween IV.  Then Halloween V.  Then Halloween VI.  Then Halloween VII.  Oops - I mean Halloween H2O - the movie that is supposed to be the true sequel to Halloween II.

Yes, you can view it as the sequel to Halloween II.  Therefore, some people say H2O really is considered Halloween III.  But if you ask me, there's only one Halloween III, and that movie came out in 1982 while there was still hope for the franchise to feature a different storyline each year.  But...instead we have a screwed up series of movies where Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H2O are related/connected to each other, while Halloween III is its own separate story and IV, V, and VI are satellites of Halloween and Halloween II with drastically altered stories with only a vague connection to the first two movies.  Then we have Halloween VIII (Halloween Resurrection), which is related to H2O for only the first few minutes of the movie when Laurie Strode is killed off by Michael Myers, then it turns into a completely different and separate movie.  Confused yet?

So, what about H2O?  We have Jamie Lee Curtis returning after 17 years of Halloween sequels to tie the first two movies and this one together.  The acting is OK, the killings are pretty cool, and the suspense is pretty good (though very predictable a lot of the time).  LL Cool J appears in the movie as a security guard.  Jamie Lee's mother, Janet Leigh, makes a cameo appearance.  Then there's Michael Myers, played by Chris Durand.  Same old Michael Myers.  Stalks and doesn't say a word.  Stabs people.

I think we did need this franchise to go in a different direction starting in 1982.",1291852800,,2979,4.69825918762089
986257,4,6305171769,"""Halloween H20"" is the 7th film in the Halloween franchise, and the sixth to tell a story of the relentless killer, Michael Myers. The H20 in the title makes reference to the 20th anniversary of the original film, and this also means the film is set 20 years after the original. However, this film ignores all the previous Halloween sequels, creating its own new continuity. That's actually a pet-peeve of mine, but it's hard to complain about it when they finally get back the original star, Jamie Lee Curtis, to continue the story of Laurie Strode. In fact, the bonus features on this DVD imply that this was a pet project of Jamie's.

So, 20 years after Laurie Strode was traumatically stalked by her brother, Michael, in the first two Halloween films, we pick up with her life as a private school headmistress using the false name of ""Keri Tate"" to prevent her brother from finding her once again. Laurie has seriously been disturbed by her past though, and she is now an alcoholic with a dependency on medications as well, struggling to go on and raise her teenage son who feels she is overbearing and overprotective. Laurie is also trying to have a romantic relationship with a school counselor who seems quite perfect for her, but ultimately, things are going to fall apart, because you know Michael Myers has finally picked up her trail, and Laurie is finally going to have to face off with her monster once and for all.

""Halloween H20"", should have been the dream sequel for hardcore fans of the original two films. Unfortunately, I often only hear negatives about it. Personally, I feel people are determined to judge these nostalgia sequels extra harshly. This isn't a bad film, it's just got some issues that are instant turn-offs for many. Probably the biggest problem is that it screams 90's horror. Watching this, you could easily be convinced you were watching a Scream, Urban Legend, or I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel. Now, I like those movies myself. Most are not as good as seventies and early eighties horror, and they're more dated too, but the best of them, like the original Scream, are very good. Much better than later ones, like the Black Christmas or Prom Night remakes. However, it admittedly is a little weird to see a Halloween film that looks so much like a Scream film. I think a lot of people just have a real problem with that, as a lot of horror fans just hate 90's horror stylings. Frankly, probably the biggest problem for me was the poor comic relief in the form of LL Cool J's phone conversations with his cartoonish-sounding wife (yeah, LL Cool J is in this as a school security officer). That and the fact that you never warm up all that much to the teen characters, who are late 90's uber cool and don't really grow on you, not even Laurie's son, played by Josh Hartnett (who is always kinda hard to like). But, overall, this Halloween installment/reboot (which I remember feeling very short when I saw it in the theater) is actually pretty good, I feel, if you can get past all the 90's stuff. The point of this story is Laurie Strode dealing with her demons, and I think the ending would have been a better ending for this run of Myers all together before the later reboot. What a shame they felt they had to make one more. Anyway, I can understand how there are many reasons to not love this film, but it still is pretty enjoyable and it's great to catch up with Laurie Strode again. Definitely a must have for fans of the original two films. Well, a must-see at least. The DVD holds a behind the scenes featurette, a trivia game, and a music video. Kind of light for a ""Collector's Series Deluxe Edition"". Oh well.",1290384000,3,3669,4.566009104704097

Halloween III was a failed effort to turn the series into The Twilight Zone, while Halloween 4, 5, and 6 featured Michael stalking a new familial target while killing more teenagers along the way, and they even dared to give some kind of mystical explanation to Michael's immortality. It seemed like the series had hit rock bottom.

But then Jamie Lee Curtis, the original ""Scream Queen"", decided to return for a 20th anniversary film, hence the title ""Halloween H20"" (though some thought the title implied that Michael Myers would be stalking people underwater or on a cruise ship). Jamie thought it would be interesting to get everyone back together for one more hurrah. However, Donald Pleasence, who had lived in the role of Dr. Loomis for years, had passed away after the completion of Halloween 6, and John Carpenter declined to be involved, having washed his hands of the series long ago. Director Steve Miner, helmer of Friday the 13th Part 2, was tapped to direct instead.

As eariler stated, Halloween H20 takes place in 1998, 20 years after Michael Myers first tried to kill his sister Laurie Strode, and the film acts as if all the sequels after Halloween II never happened, effectively becoming ""Halloween III"" in a sense. To avoid future attacks from her unkillable brother, Laurie changed her named and moved out to California, where she started a new life. Headmistress of a private school and the overprotective mother of a teenage son John (Josh Hartnett), Laurie is still haunted by nightmares and hallucinations of Michael. But her nightmares come true, as Michael returns once again, and Laurie must not only find the courage to protect her son, but find the strength to confront her demons and face her brother once and for all in a fight to the death.

I was disappointed that the film doesn't take place in Haddonfield, Illinois, but in the very summery, un-Halloween location of the Northern California hills instead, but it makes a lot more sense that Laurie would flee to the other side of the country to hide from Michael. And I would move out of Haddonfield too, especially before late October rolls around, since lots of people tend to die there around that time.

Jamie Lee Curtis elevates this film, giving us a protagonist not often seen in slasher films of this kind, mostly because few protagonists ever survive long enough to reach Laurie Strode's level of psychological damage and world weariness. Though I still miss the late, great Donald Pleasence in this film, Laurie Strode no longer needs Dr. Loomis' protection. Rather than telling the story of a timid young woman facing a threat she doesn't understand, Halloween H20 is the story of the survivor struggling with the aftermath, and a mature woman who knows exactly what she's up against and must summon the will to see the situation to its unavoidable end, for the good or the bad. It's the best possible resolution for one of horror's quintessential survivors.

Being the seventh (!) installment in the franchise, it isn't without its homages. Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' mother, a horror icon in her own right, famous for her shower death scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho) plays a rather motherly supporting role, and drives away in the same car she drove in Hitchcock's classic. One character is killed the exact same way one of the nurses is killed in Halloween II, and the film's finale is reminiscent of the finale of Halloween 4.

This should have been the end of the franchise, a fitting swan song for an iconic movie monster who terrorized audiences for two decades and the cap to a story of one of cinema's most memorable protagonists coming full circle and finally getting the revenge and closure she deserves. Hollywood seems allergic to finality, always leaving room for the next sequel to make money off of. Halloween looked to be one of the rare exceptions when H20 was released, knowing that it had run its course and that it had an opportunity few of its contemporaries ever get - to say goodbye the right way. But like Michael Myers himself, the franchise never seems to die, no matter how many beatings it takes. H20 would be followed up with Halloween: Resurrection and later with Rob Zombie's own retread of the Halloween story, once again plunging the series into the gutter H20 had salvaged it from.

TRIVIA: Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you if you think Michael Myers' signature white mask keeps changing throughout the course of the film. Apparently during production, Dimension Films never seemed satsified with the look of the mask, so it was repeatedly redesigned. Effects companies KNB and Stan WInston both worked on the mask, and even George Lucas' Indusrial Light & Magic had to be brought in to digitally correct the mask with a ""CGI mask"" during scenes that couldn't be reshot.",1281225600,,5175,4.9006849315068495
986312,4,6305171769,"Well, its been twenty years since the first Halloween, and ten years since Part 4.

Now since the terrible Halloween 6, I was really not giving this one hope at all. But, I watched it all way through, and was amazed. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode (this time with her son played by Josh Harnett). Laurie is a school teacher know, and its around that time of year......you guessed it, Halloween! Well Laurie has put most of her past with Michael Myers aside, and lives a nice life now. But.....Michael Myers is back, wanting revenge (wow, hasn't this guy gotten weak in 20 years?!)

Michael tracks her down and just starts killing all of the people that work with her, not mich can be said, alot of the film is probably Laurie with her son or boyfriend.

But the main scene of the film, and what made me like this film, was the ""fight scene"", where Laurie comfronts Michael at the school, where the roles are switched, and Laurie is hunting Michael, after an evil game of hide and seek in the school, Laurie finds him, and pushes him off a high floor of the building, just like at the end of the first movie. To double check Michael is dead, she decapitates Michael, to the films end, which Would've been a great ending to the series, but sadly, they ruined it.......with a resurrection.

But theres one more thing I should talk about before I go, at a horror convention, I picked up:

""Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode"" (aka the workprint of H20). In my opnion, the films are ALMOST the same, the workprint just shows some minor added scenes and a slight alternate ending, but in this case, I'm still rooting for the actual theatrical version, H20!",1278374400,,1673,4.5049504950495045
986313,4,6305171769,"The last decade or so has not been the highlight of the Halloween series. Resurrection was a disaster, and so were Rob Zombie's interpretations of the first 2 films. They were all cluttered with typical, unimaginative slash-em-up fanfare with no creativity behind them. Considering Michael has been terrorizing Haddonfield since 1978, it's not surprising that the series is losing steam by now. However, H20 is by far the best of the recent Halloween flicks, and one of the best in the series.

The plot is simple: Laurie Strode is 20 years older, has a successful career, a son, and a love interest. But there's just one problem--the memories of her uncle on that fateful night (which spanned 1 and 2) still haunt her. She has resorted to an alcohol problem and pigeonholing her 17-year-old son, latching onto the hope that it would help her cope. Everyone around her tells her to move on, but lo and behold, Myers is back! After stealing information on the whereabouts of his niece, he's goes on the prowl to finish what he started 20 years ago. John Carpenter creates his vision of the Myers trilogy very well. The ""Thorn"" trilogy, as it's called, is ignored with H20; Carpenter wasn't too happy with how Myers was portrayed in 4-6 (4, in my opinion and many others', is the best sequel of the series, actually. 5 is pretty good and underrated, but I'll side with Carpenter on Part 6!). It brings everything full circle, and the head-on collision between Myers and Laurie is very intense and enjoyable. Watching them wage a battle on each other alone throughout the school contains some of the most memorable moments the series has to offer. The cast is great. Jamie Lee Curtis does as great of a job as ever. She continues the story of Laurie in a way that is logical and fits within her characterization. LL Cool J plays the lovable security guard who is an aspiring romantic writer. The teen actors and actresses are all perfectly likable, and behave how teens do in this day and age. This is also the only movie of the series to provide a sense of closure. Some fans will hate it, some will love it.

But not everything is perfect. The movie lacks suspense where it otherwise could have had it. The epic orchestration is fitting in some parts of the movie, but totally unnecessary in others. Had it been cut out in some scenes, there could have been much more tension and more of a horror vibe. It almost pains me because it truly does ruin some scenes. Michael's mask shows too much of the skin around his eyes, making him appear more human, which further lessens the tension. The mask in the early films was far more effective. Also, H20 takes awhile to get the ball rolling. I understand the need to develop the characters, but there's a noticeable lack of Michael in the first segment of the film, and it makes the film drag. I liked the ending, and I applaud Carpenter's attempt to conjure a sense of resolution, but it feels somewhat anti-climactic. It's not quite as earth-shattering as it should have and had the right to have been. It's quite unexpected, and there's a good chance that it might make you jump, but more could have been done with such a monumental moment.

As far as sequels go, however, H20 works pretty damn well, and provides a highly entertaining experience. Carpenter is one of horror's finest directors, and H20 is almost worthy of joining the ranks of his trilogy masterpiece (Halloween, The Fog, The Thing). There is only so much one can do with an idea that's been used over and over for 20 years (32 as of writing this review), but Carpenter makes us of all of it and more to create one of the best installments in the Halloween saga.",1276300800,4,3675,4.599085365853658

H20 was actually my introduction to the Halloween series and probably the reason it took me a while to follow up by seeing the original films. The reason being that the film is a fairly generic mid-90's slasher aside from the brother vs. sister angle. The final fight and aftermath is great, but the other kills (especially the opener) are fairly boring.

The Michael Myers character and performance are great, the only problem being that they allowed us to see his eyes and they were far from ""the blackest eyes...the devil's eyes"".

Personally, I would have preferred a follow up to Halloween 4 that brought Jamie in contact with Laurie (friendly or otherwise) then Michael appearing to attack them both.

986317,4,6305171769,"Following the original ""Halloween"" from director John Carpenter in 1978, this franchise had for all intents and purposes succumbed to the very same pratfalls that have befallen virtually every other horror franchise in existence. What this means is that the series that birthed the very sub-genre it exists within had become nothing more than another lame slasher franchise cranking out useless sequel after sequel, paying little attention to the fact that the stories were fast becoming old and tired.

In 1995, after the sixth film in the series massively disappointed audiences, the future for the franchise no doubt lay in question. Not to mention, the impending twentieth anniversary of the original ""Halloween"" loomed on the horizon, and it was looking as if the date would be remembered with little to no fanfare. However, all of that changed in the summer of 1998, when original star Jamie Lee Curtis reprised her role of Laurie Strode for the seventh installment in the series, ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"".

""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" is essentially summed up by the title. Basically, 20 years after the terrible events that victimized Laurie Strode, she continues to live in fear of the possibility that one day her killer brother may finally find her. Living under assumed names, Laurie and her 17-year-old son (Josh Hartnett) are doing their best to keep their dark family secret buried, while carrying on with some semblance of a normal life. However, some secrets are too powerful to be kept hidden forever, and Michael is determined to finish what he started all those years ago.

Over the course of the 17 year gap that separates ""Halloween 2"" and ""Halloween H20"" there was numerous other installments released as a part of the franchise. With the release of ""H20"" all of the sequels beyond the second movie have been omitted from the series' accepted continuity. For those who are curious, the reason is that movies 3 through 6 did not feature Jamie Lee Curtis or her character Laurie Strode; instead, the focus shifted to Laurie's orphaned daughter (apparently Laurie died in a car wreck or something like that) who is now being hunted by her dear old Uncle Michael. Even though some plot threads from those previous films were somewhat promising; in the end, it was easier to disregard them for the story in ""H20"" rather than to rewrite some of the history. While all of this was not incredibly important, I did feel that some exposition was needed for those who may not be aware of why the plots from movies 3 through 6 are never even touched upon, and in fact, most are contradicted by events in ""Halloween H20"". Anyways, that's a basic rundown on the history of the ""Halloween"" franchise.

If you ever watched any of the previous sequels, then you undoubtedly noticed that the quality of writing took a serious nose-dive from where the series began (which in itself wasn't exactly brilliant from start to finish). Along with the massive slate cleaning that ""H20"" brought to the series, the writing for this sequel was much stronger than all of the previous installments thanks to screenwriters Robert Zappia (""Five Days to Midnight"") and Matt Greenberg (""Reign of Fire""), along with some re-writes by Kevin Williamson (""Scream"").

The overall plot for the film is relatively solid, albeit with a few head scratching moments as most horror movies tend to have, but more on that later. The story took a mature approach to the ramifications of that horrific Halloween night and how even after all this time Laurie still lives in fear of her brother's possible return. Even though at first glance the premise that Michael has supposedly been waiting all this time to come after his sister once again seems a bit far-fetched; the manner in which that plot point was handled was surprisingly effective. I also appreciated the attempt to bring a potential resolution to the conflict set up so long ago between Laurie and Michael. If for no other reason, that portion of the story alone is worth watching for longtime fans of the original who have always wanted to see brother and sister come face-to-face once more.

It has become quite clear that the success of horror hits such as ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" made an impact on the characters' interactions in this film and almost any other horror films that have followed them. The banter, especially between the teenagers, is fast-paced and loaded with innuendo and pop culture references (as are most teenage conversations). I also noticed that when the adult characters were on the screen the slick, fairly well-written dialogue didn't just disappear or become stale, as is so often the case; instead, it matured (without being too heavy-handed) to tackle the bigger issues that the adult characters, most notably Laurie, were facing throughout the movie.

Now, as I alluded to a moment ago, there were some weak spots in the story though. The biggest weakness this film had was with some of the characters. It seems that ever since ""Halloween"" started this sub-genre of horror that every other film of this kind must feature the same basic cast of characters in some form or another. You've got the rebellious guy, the smart girl, and the horny guy and his female equal, and so on and so forth. While this cast is smaller than many other horror films, it still fills most of the roles with standard stock characters. The only difference here is that in the case of Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams, they actually appeared to be trying to bring some depth and realism to their characters; thus, serving to elevate their status above all the others in the pantheon of unoriginal character archetypes in horror films. But beyond those two, the rest of the teenaged characters were typical carbon copies left over from previous horror movies.

Another couple of issues with this film revolved around the improbability of how Michael either knows to be in certain places to kill someone or somehow catches up to a person running, despite the fact that he's walking as slowly and methodically as possible. Those two faults are not exclusive to this series rather they are common issues in almost every single horror franchise in existence. It does not matter what horror franchise you look at, this is a problem area that is universal and has always irritated me. What I want to know is, ""Why most directors choose to go along with this obvious absurdity?"" And lastly, the pacing early on in the story was a little on the slow side. I enjoyed the opening moments of the film that served as a set-up for the remainder of the movie, but the 15 to 20 minutes that followed struggled to keep things going strong. Note to the writers of horror films, the key is to always keep the audience on edge, it worked for John Carpenter in 1978, and I'm willing to bet it still does even now.

As for the performances in this movie, let us begin by discussing the return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the role that made her into a household name. Jamie's performance as Laurie is much more mature and refined here than it was in the original film, and let's just forget about the colossal waste of time that summed up her appearance in the initial sequel. Jamie skillfully portrays the radical change in her character from a woman who continues to be victimized by her memories to a woman ready for a final showdown with her tormentor. From the quieter moments between mother and son, to her soul-bearing confession as to who she really is, to her inevitable moment of truth; Jamie Lee excels in every respect and the movie definitely benefits from her terrific return to the series.

In the supporting roles are mostly up-and-coming talents, although some of these talents are obviously stronger than others. Leading the way for the supporting cast members, as I noted earlier, are Josh Hartnett (""Pearl Harbor"") and Michelle Williams (""Brokeback Mountain""). Both appeared to be committed to their roles, not willing to sit idly by and just speak the lines and hit their marks in as uninspired a fashion as possible; instead, they opted to let their characters emotions and motivations shine through naturally. Plus, their characters' onscreen chemistry seemed more genuine than most in horror franchises, resulting in their romantic relationship becoming more believable than one would expect.

Next, we have LL Cool J (TV's ""NCIS: Los Angeles"") as a mediocre security guard with lofty aspirations. LL has proven in several other projects since his role in this movie that he clearly has acting talent; however, in this role he is merely average. At times his portrayal seemed a little shaky as if he couldn't quite get a handle on the character; however, this problem could be more a fault of the script than the actor in the role. Still, despite a potentially weak character arc, LL should have been able to do more with the role; instead, he seemed to rest on his laurels causing his performance to suffer as a result.

Bringing up the rear in the performance category are Jodi Lyn O'Keefe (""The Crow: Salvation"") and Adam Hann-Byrd (""Jumanji"") in the heavily clichd roles of the sex-crazed teenagers in the movie. Both roles are only included in the movie to fulfill some prerequisite that apparently stipulates that every horror film have at least one promiscuous couple within the cast. While almost every movie has one or two meaningless roles in their lineup, horror films always seem to make sure those roles are the most irritating to audiences; all the while, finding their way into more scenes than they deserve within the movie. I will admit that at least the writers seemed to attempt to flesh out Jodi and Adam's characters. Yet an over-reliance on sexual puns and unoriginality within the roles overshadowed all efforts to elevate the characters above being anything more than typical throwaway horny teenagers.

""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" is the first sequel in the franchise to even come close to rivaling the original in any respect. While the film is stronger in some areas than the first ""Halloween"", it still never manages to recapture the atmosphere and style that was so integral to that one's success. Until someone can either channel John Carpenter's directing choices and abilities into another one of these installments or coax Carpenter into returning for another round, I doubt we'll ever see a movie in this franchise reach the level of the first one.

Better yet, write them off as being one long dream like the viewers had to do when Bobby Ewing was killed by Catherine Wentworth's car on ""Dallas.""

However, Nancy Stephens has returned to reprise her role as nurse Marion Chambers Whittington, the one who was with Dr. Loomis the night Michael Myers escaped from the sanitarium on Halloween eve of 1978.  Michael breaks into her home office and learns where Laurie is hiding.  Naturally, his goal is to kill her and anyone else within easy reach.  He still has an insatiable appetite for bloody carnage and the ability to withstand multiple gunshot wounds.

  Jamie Lee Curtis has aged well; her character is stronger, quicker, and wiser than twenty years ago.  She does an excellent job of hiding from and outsmarting her brother.  It was a treat to see Curtis with her real life mom, Janet Leigh of ""Psycho,"" who is one of the teachers.  She should've fallen prey to Michael, but she leaves school before the murders begin.  The last time I recall Curtis and Leigh together was in ""The Fog.""  Also rounding out a cast of stars is LL Cool J (""Deep Blue Sea"" and ""Rollerball"") as the security guard, Josh Harnett (""Faculty"" and ""30 Days of Night"") as John Tate, Michele Williams (""Species"" and ""Dawson's Creek""), and Alan Arkin (""Knots Landing"" and ""Northern Exposure"") as the guidance counselor who is secretly dating Laurie though he doesn`t know her true identity.

  A higher body count would've made this film more fun.  The school is practically deserted because of a fieldtrip to Yosemite Park.  I would've had about one hundred students in the school; at least a dozen are massacred before the alarms are sounded; and mayhem ensues as the school is evacuated on a cold, stormy night.  Think ""Halloween"" meets ""Terror Train.""

  The secluded mountain school provides a chilling atmosphere for this holiday slasher.

986410,1,6305171769,"This was a strange move by Dimension, who had picked up the ""Halloween"" franchise. The first Dimension ""Halloween"", part 6 ""The Curse Of Michael Myers"", was a great film - before the last third was reshot due to the postfilming death of Donald Pleasance. In order to keep the series going, they needed a new ending, which almost destroyed the movie. Then they came out with this one, which bizarrely ignores everything that had happened in parts 4, 5 and their own 6 (in fact I believe ""H20"" also pretty much threw out part 2, but I'm not certain about it). And...why? To...accomplish what? I have no idea why Dimension, usually a first-rate company, would just give the middle finger to not only ""Halloween"" fans but also the artists who contributed to the series. Makes no sense.
Well, it may have been forgivable had ""H20"" been a great film. But it wasn't even a good film, and the much hyped return of Jamie Lee Curtis didn't amount to anything more than that, hype. ""H20"" is a mess of a movie, a standard glossy Hollywood shocker in that already dated ""Scream"" mold. There's a bunch of young actors and actresses doing absolutely nothing, and there's so many of those ""fake scares"" - I believe about 287 of 'em - that it simply becomes annoying in the extreme. ""H20"" is not only not scary, it's boring and irritating.
Most of the longtime ""Halloween"" fans don't consider ""H20"" or it's equally crappy followup ""Halloween: Resurrection"" to be canonical entries in the series; by ignoring the Myers mythology, what other conclusion can be drawn? And say what you will about Zombie's remake; at least it is a good, disturbing little flick. But ""H20"" and ""Resurrection"" are just terrible commercial products designed to make a quick buck.

I saw the original when I was about 8-9 may be a little older perhaps 10-11, but I never forgot that white mask or the eerie music cue that signaled The Shape was close by. Towards the end of the 90's I found out there was going to be another Halloween movie released (not knowing there were about 6 other films out there, I assumed this was the sequel at the time). H20 automatically became a favorite after I saw it in the theater, and now at long last I own the DVD (which makes me extremely happy). I had forgotten all about this movie which I consider as I think most/some of the fans do THE END of the Halloween story. I've always counted this as the final chapter since it had a pretty clear cut ending if you'll forgive the pun and even though I don't like to see that certain someone die, I thought this was the right way to go with it. This film is one of the ""must see"" ones for any fan of Halloween, I highly recommend it!

I have seen 1 and 2, then this film, resurrection and the Rob Zombie remake and of these I would rate this one as he best- great suspense- however for its time I am sure that 1 and 2 were spectacular.

As for the Halloween cycle in general: Spoilers included-
In this film I loved that Laurie killed Michael but then he returns for Resurrection where she is killed? Thats where the problem lies for me. I feel this movie needs closure (if the remake of the whole series is going to get done- after seeing the remake of the original I doubt that I will be interested) and the way to get closure is to kill Michael- if Laurie is really dead (after all the torture she should have the right to kill him) then her son should be the one to kill him. But we need atleast one more original Halloween for closure- and to end the series Michael needs to die (though up to the remake I have always rooted for him and Laurie- wishing neither character death.)",1201046400,,1039,4.350515463917525

986417,4,6305171769,"At long last, here's a ""Halloween"" movie sequel that's worth talking about. ""Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later"" (the seventh film in the series) goes back to its roots by bringing back a character that's been sorely missed in the last four films of the series. As a matter of fact, this film was made as if the last four films didn't even exist. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphant return to the role that made her a star. She also suggested this project. Kevin Williamson, who was the writer of the first two ""Scream"" movies (which was inspired by ""Halloween""), was an executive producer of ""Halloween H2O"", and along with director Steve Miner (who got his start by directing the second and third ""Friday the 13th"" movies) they made a very good horror movie. ""Halloween H2O"" takes place in 1998, 20 years after the original film with Michael Myers continuing his pursuit of long lost sister Laurie Strode. But finding her has been very hard to come by for Michael, because Laurie faked her death shortly after what happened in 1978, and 20 years later has been living a different life in California under the name of Keri Tate. But the memories of Halloween night 1978 continue to haunt her, which has become too much to handle for her teenage son John. She's the headmistress of a private school in Summer Glen, California that John attends. John has a nice girlfriend, Molly, while Laurie/Keri has a love interest in Will, a fellow staff member of the school. Things aren't exactly perfect for Laurie/Keri as the film starts, and things eventually get worse when Michael Myers finally tracks her down. ""Halloween H2O"" is easily the best sequel of the series. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a powerful performance here, and her presence in this film gives the ""Halloween"" series a much needed jolt of adrenaline. Adam Arkin is very good as Will, a person that Laurie/Keri feels comfortable with telling about her dark past. Michelle Williams (who was starring on the hit series ""Dawson's Creek"" at the time, and years before receiving an Oscar nomination for ""Brokeback Mountain"") has a good part as Molly, and Josh Hartnett (in his film debut) is terrific as John. LL Cool J provides the film's comic relief as the school security guard, and Curtis' real life mother, ""Psycho"" star Janet Leigh, has a nice cameo as Laurie's/Keri's school secretary (I like the ""Psycho"" reference in one of Leigh's scenes). The main reason why ""Halloween H2O"" works is because it's more closer to the original film than the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ""Halloween"" films. And director Steve Miner and his writing team came up with a good story by taking Michael Myers out of Haddonfield and putting him in a small town in California. It was getting boring with each ""Halloween"" movie going back to Haddonfield for more mayhem. A new location I thought was a very good idea. The film is pretty violent at times, though it's the least violent ""Halloween"" movie since the original film. ""Halloween H2O"" of course isn't up there with the first film, but it comes the closest of any film in the series. The ""Halloween"" movies that are worth seeing are the first, second, and seventh films. The rest are either so-so (like ""Halloween 4"") or dreadful (like ""Halloween 5""). ""Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later"" is a very good sequel to the best slasher film of all time. Plus, it was a big hit at the box-office, grossing $55 million domestically.",1193788800,3,3410,4.771573604060913
986418,5,6305171769,"Of course, the original ""Halloween"" can never be topped.  Except maybe by ""Psycho"", which can never be topped.  Anyway, who'd have thought the SIXTH sequel would be this scary, witty, and well-cast, with bells and whistles galore?  H20 is all that.

Our sequel begins with Michael breaking into the late Dr. Loomis' house and terrorizing Nurse Marian (a character from the first movie) and two teenagers.  He steals a file kept on Laurie Strode, which revealed that she faked her death and assumed a new identity as headmistress of a ""very posh, secluded private school in Northern California.""  He manages to get from Illinois to Cali in two days (in two really old cars--everything works out for him!), and hijinks ensue.

I love you, Jamie Lee Curtis.  She's one of my all-time favorites.  All her (acting) akills are on display here.  She's smart, funny, vulnerable, strong, neurotic, and controlling, all at the same time.  Without her intelligence, the script's unique efforts to show Laurie's psychic torment over 20 years could easily have come off as unsympathetic psychobabble.  Laurie's had lots of therapy, is highly-medicated, sneaks drinks (not all her self-help efforts are doctor-approved), and won't let her son (far) out of her sight.  Mom and son argue (realistically!) about her ""irrational"" fears ruining both their lives.  Most importantly, in the movie's biggest turning point, Laurie passes up the chance to escape and chooses to confront Michael.  Her ""empowerment"" is pure edge-of-your-seat entertainment.

The supporting cast is fantastic.  I can't believe some of these other reviews dis the acting.  Yup, no way Josh Hartnett or Michelle Williams are gonna have a future in the business.  The kids playing their friends (Adam Hann-Byrd and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), too far down the supporting cast for safety, actually outplay their now-more-famous costars here.  And, that's none other than LL Cool J as a thoroughly unsuccessful security guard for the school.  His phone conversations with his wife, who is only heard on the other end of the line, are perfect comic relief.  Adam Arkin has the worst line in the movie (""That's sucky""?! when JLC confides that her brother killed her sister!!!???)  He goes on to make an even bigger blunder before...well, never mind...

A scene with Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's real-life mom and ultra-victim in ""Psycho,"" actually includes the notorious car from that all-time classic.  Later, ""Scream 2"" is playing on a dorm room TV.  And the most soothing oldie one can hear before being brutally slain, the Chordettes' ""Mister Sandman,"" again features on the ""Halloween"" playlist.

A DVD extra has Curtis, Arkin, director Steve Miner, John Carpenter, and other behind-the-scenes folks discussing H20 and the ""Halloween"" phenomenon in general.

This is probably the best entry since ""Halloween II"", in terms of performances and the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is back as terrorised Laurie Strode.  To properly enjoy this film, you have to disregard the 4th and 5th films which featured Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd.  There is no daughter here, instead we have Laurie's son John (played by Josh Hartnett).

The film picks up 20 years to the day of the original Haddonfield slayings.

Sadistic, unstoppable Michael Myers has tracked down her records and decides a little family reunion is needed, but this time, Laurie vows to ensure it will be the final showdown...

Jamie Lee Curtis perfectly slips back into the role of Laurie, and the rest of the cast is equally fine, including Jamie's legendary mother (Janet Leigh, ""Psycho"") in a fun cameo as the school receptionist, Josh Hartnett as her son, and Adam Arkin as her boyfriend.

This is the entry, the sequel everyone was looking forward to, the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and when Laurie and Michael see each other again.

Laurie has a 17 year old son and she is the headmistress of a secluded private boarding school.  20 years after he first attacked her he came back, she thinks her son is the one in danger, he is, but she has more to fear than her son's life.  Laurie stops running and faces her fear in the most amazing ending the series has ever seen.

Note that this movie completely ignores parts 3-6 so continuity for this entry as part of the series is completely screwed up.  The acting is extra ordinary in this entry, the best acting in the entire series comes from this entry.  Jamie gives her strongest performance as Lauries in this entry.  And unlike the previous two entries Michael is top notch in this entry, Michael is really scary.

This entry doesn't suffer from much asside from giving LL Cool J a role this entry soars on all levels.  The ending where she attempts to grab his hand is the most emotional part of the series.

The bonus feature ""Unmasking the Horror"" is very informative, but again, Jamie sounds like an idiot in her interviews and everyone else sounds smarter than her which is the exact opposite as on film where she appears to be the smartest person on screen.

The film's vibe succeeds without too much gratutious sex and gore, and keeps you on the edge until the end.

986520,2,6305171769,"I remember when I was in fifth grade, I snuck downstairs late at night to sneak a peek at the original Halloween when it was on HBO. I was mesmerized and scared to death at the same time. ""The Shape,"" aka Michael Myers, was a chilling and oddly fascinating character. The sight of his shadow on the side of a building sent shivers up my spine.

I remember a scene that showed his silhouette against a house for a few seconds and the camera cut away as someone caught a glimpse of him. When the camera returned, he was gone. Little things like that scared me more than what little blood there was. Halloween sparked a number of imitators that added buckets of blood, but none of them had those little scary touches like the scene of ""The Shape"" against the wall.

So when Halloween: H20 was announced, I was at once a little skeptical but excited. Jamie Lee Curtis would reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the survivor of the first and second Halloween movies. H20 would be ignoring those sequels from 1982 to 1996, that had basically turned the storyline into another slasher epic, with the addition of psychic powers, strange secondary characters and a complete loss of focus on the true nature of what had made the original so powerful. With a lot to live up to, Halloween: H20 had the potential to disappoint as easily as it could return the series to greatness.

Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to the original. It barely matches up to 1981's unnecessary Halloween II. It tries very hard to be better than those other, now ignored, sequels, but it doesn't quite make it.

It's now 1998 and Laurie Strode has moved to Northern California to take a job as the head of a private school. She has a 17-year old son named John (Josh Harnett), who attends the school. Laurie and John have been battling the demons inside Laurie's head in different ways. Laurie copes through alcohol and John tries to keep her straight. It's beginning to take a huge toll on both of them, and something's got to give. A visit from Michael Myers, however, is not quite what they need -- but it's what they get.

I'll leave what little plot is left to the movie. If you decide to see it, you won't need to take notes to keep anything straight. It's as simple as slasher movie plots get, with plenty of false scares and predictable dialogue. The movie tries hard to be unique, even including appearances from L.L. Cool J, Adam Arkin and Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' real life mom and Psycho star.)

However, director Steve Miner, who directed Friday the 13th Part II and Friday the 13th Part III, attempts to pay homage to the original by aping some of its best scenes. Only one, involving a closet, pays off. The rest are so blatantly lifted from the 1978 original, it gives the movie a by-the-numbers appearance, as if Miner expected to regain the greatest of the original by taking the best scenes from it. That's like attempting to retain a painting's originality by simply taking a picture of it. It may look good from far away, but up close it's going to be missing more than a few key elements.

If nothing else, Halloween H20 serves as an adequate final chapter in the splintered timeline of the Halloween series. That's about it.",1144368000,2,3227,4.5438898450946645

Salutes and tributes to horror were all over the film with scenes referencing scenes from the original film (the sightings out the window in the middle of class) to icon cameos (Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis's mother/Psycho star) and the return of I&II's chain smoking nurse) to an opening tribute to Donald Pleasance via a voice over of classic lines from Halloween I.

Also good casting which became few are far between at the sequel attempts after Halloween II (Josh Harnett became a super heartthrob and Michelle Williams recently garnered an Academy Award nonination).

Yes it was Micheal Myers' head that was chopped off and not a paramedic with a crushed larynx. The proof it is Michael is that he assaulted Laurie in the van, if his larynx is crushed he could not breathe so he would have died before he was decapitated, he was hit with a one ton (I think) coroner truck so therefore if that was not Michael he would have been killed, he had Chris Durrand's eyes (the one who plays Michael in H20) and if you were there and you were not Michael wouldn't you take off the mask and show that you are not him.

986570,4,6305171769,"After Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers, and Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween H20 was a much needed installment for the series. With the last two films the series had started to take a slow decline, and H20 attempts to correct the mistakes the last films made, while taking Myers effectively into the new decade. It's been said before, but this is truly the best sequel in the series since Halloween II. It definitely has the classic feel that made the first two movies genuienly creepy, as well as great direction. That's the key, where as the last two films tended to focus on excessive (and sometime ridiculously stupid) violence, and completely confusing stories, Halloween H20 takes the series back to its basics and returns to what made the films scary in the first place; suspense. While it's not the best the series has ever offered (that honor of course belongs to the original) Halloween H20 is miles ahead of anything that was attempted in Halloween 4-6, and will definitely restore faith in anyone who thought the series was dying off slow and painfully.

Finally the story in a Halloween movie is clear. Forget anything that took place in Halloween 4-6. Halloween H20 completely erases those events (which I don't necessarily agree with, but hey it works) and picks up twenty years after the end of the second film. Apparently Michael Myers' body was never found at the scene of the accident in the last movie, which lead Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to fake her death and change her name and location to attempt to allude her brother, whom she believes is still alive. However after the death of Dr. Loomis, Myers has aquired papers from Loomis' home explaining exactly what his sister has been up to in the last twenty years. With that in hand he travels to California where Laurie is now the head of a secluded private school, and working under the name Keri Tate. And from there the fun insues. There are a couple of strange moments in the plot, mainly that the story leads you to believe at first that Myers true target is Laurie's son John (Josh Hartnett), although he quickly disappears before the movie is over. For the most part the scenes are extremely suspenseful (especially when Myers is trying to get into the gate when John and his girlfriend are outside Laurie's house), and the direction really creates some great moments throughout the film. The acting is better than anything seen in the last three movies, mainly because of Jamie Lee Curtis' return, although her performance isn't nearly as powerful as the original (but it can be forgiven). Cleaning up the story as well made the film a lot better, because there's no confusion about what's going on; Michael is there to kill Laurie Strode, and anyone else who gets in his way. The cast plays their parts especially well, including Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams, and even LL Cool J (although his character is ridiculously stupid in this movie). The real star of the show is Jamie Lee Curtis though. She definitely adds a whole new dimension to the film because her acting is one of a kind, and having her return to do this film makes it feel more like the original.

While it's not the best the series has seen, and it definitely has it's flaws, Halloween H20 is way ahead of anything that 4-6 tried to do. I was glad to see the series get back on track with this one. If you were a fan of the original Halloween or any of the later sequels, I think you'll find yourself pleasently surprised by this one. My expectations for this film were pretty low considering what I had to go on off of Halloween 5 and 6, but it went above and beyond anything I believed it could have. Too bad Halloween: Resurrection effectively killed everything this movie accomplished, but no matter. Even without Resurrection this film stands on its own as a great addition to the Halloween family.",1131408000,2,3892,4.663755458515284
986571,4,6305171769,"Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode in this fast-paced sequel.

This movie basically is about Laurie Strode and what she has done with her life since 1978, now living in California with her son John played by Josh Hartnett. She has changed her name to Keri Tate and has a new boyfriend Will Brennan play by Adam Arkin. While she deals with her haunted past, she has to deal with her teenage son who is going through a life of his own, with his girlfriend Molly played by Michelle Williams, and his two other friends Sarah and Charles (two characters who are only in the movie to die) played by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Adam Hann-Byrd.

There is a great cameo by Janet Leigh, not only Jamie Lee Curtis's mother but also the star of the classic movie Psycho. LL Cool J also makes a good appearance, i was going to call him the worst actor alive, but i like his performance a lot better then i like Busta Rhymes in Halloween: Resurrection. Also a great appearance is Nancy Stephens, who was in the first and second Halloween, great to see her again.

This story eliminates Halloween 4-6, which i don't mind at all. However, i didn't like the way Michael Myers was portrayed. I felt his character should have been made stronger, because even in the first and second Halloweens, he had almost unlimited strength, and in H20, they don't display that. But the one good thing is that Michael finally walks like a human again, because in the last three sequels he was kind of like a robot. The mask changing in some scenes didn't bother me, i'm just glad they later told us why that happened.

I was proud of the opening credits, because just hearing the Halloween theme on strings and back to piano instead of the keyboard and guitar they did on Halloweens 4-6 really amazed me and sounded wonderful. Also, i liked hearing that speech from Halloween 1, and even though it wasn't really Donald Pleasance really doing that speech for H20, it gave the opening credits flare and a lot of power.

It is hard to watch this movie and not remember Donald Pleasance, because even though this was a good movie, that was the thing that was missing, i can only imagine how much better this sequel would of been if Donald Pleasance was in it, instead of 4 stars, it would have got a perfect 5.

My Favorite Scene(s)- Laurie and Michael in the Cafeteria, where Michael is flipping over the tables, one of the only scenes that shows his strength and i thought it was a good scene. Another scene, was the scene before the cafeteria, when Laurie stabs Michael with an Axe, even though a short scene, i loved it, it shows John Carpenters original story behind the Michael Myers character, where he is human but he is force that can't be stopped (quoted from the Halloween 25th anniversary DVD).

Best Kill(s)- Sarah's death, leg gets smashed, and she is hung on a light, for some reason, i liked that scene. Another great death was Will's death, bringing back a murder from Halloween 2 where Michael stabs a person in the back and lifts them off the ground, but H20 really made it look more realistic.

Overall- a great sequel, with its flaws of course, but a 4 out of 5.

DVD Extras- They are alright, not exactly what i was expecting, just basically a brief on the making of this movie and future plans for the series, and a few other small things like trailers.",1131235200,2,3340,4.480263157894737
986631,4,6305171769,"Welcome to Halloween III: H20. Lots of blood and suspense and a great storyline that stays true to the first two movies in the series. Michael is p***ed off! You would be too if you spent most of your life just waiting to off the rest of your family.

Let me try to clear up two concerns I've seen mentioned in other reviews:

1. LL Cool J's security guard character isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. This is probably intentional, rather than just a plot device. Have you ever seen some of the security guards who work for private companies?

2. After watching Resurrection, I couldn't seem to remember any of the pivotal scene that explains Michael's return. That is because NONE of that sequence is shown in H20. OK, so maybe we were cheated a little in this movie. But from our heroine's point of view, which is where the drama and suspense come from, she was not aware of what had happened inside after her confrontation with Michael. And if you watch carefully, he does not try to attack her during the ambulance sequences. Additionally, he does not move like the shape - this can be seen by his reactions when he sits up on the road and when he sees the ambulance rolling down the hill towards him. Anyway, I can see how the writers did this intentionally and I give them credit for it.

My only gripe is the lack of more bonus material on the DVD. I guess I'll have to pick up the special 25 year edition of the original Halloween now...",1130630400,2,1447,4.368029739776952
986632,4,6305171769,"I've never been a big fan of slasher flicks, but of all of the Jasons and Freddies out there, Michael Myers stands out.  The first two films were well above average as far as slasher flicks go.  The rest of the sequels ranged from ho-hum to absurd, but ""H2O"" makes up for all of that.  With a wonderful cast that includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, and Jodie Lynn O'Keefe, this tale is the best sequel of the bunch.  No matter that it follows any type of logic or dogma built up by the other sequels.  Think of it as the ""Batman Begins"" of slasher flicks.  It took everything good about the original film and made a solid second helping by ignoring everything that was bad in between.

As stated before, the cast is strong.  Granted, the characters are all pretty standard teen slasher characters, but they are performed in an excellent manner.  Even Michelle Williams turns in a good performance.  LL Cool J is fun to watch as a bumbling security guard and, much like his performance in ""Deep Blue Sea,"" he plays the role with flair and humorous style.

The premise is simple:  Myers is back to finish the job he started.  He wants his sis dead, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish that.

The story moves at a very good pace, and it's the first slasher to give me the willies since the original ""Halloween.""  Though the story is basically the same as every other teen hacker out there, it's one of the best.  Highly recommended to fans of modern horror flicks.  Jason might be a goalie from Hades and Freddy may rule your dreams, but Michael Myers just wants to cut people, and you've gotta love that!",1130544000,,1612,4.465753424657534

986635,4,6305171769,"When it comes right down to it, like it or not, this is the true Halloween 3.  We all know that the original Halloween 3 had nothing at all to do with the first two films.  The other sequels 4 - 6, began branching off the main characters as extended family of the Laurie Strode character who was supposed to be dead.  With Halloween H20, the sequels 4 to 6 are basically tossed out the window and erased from accepted Halloween Canon.  The good news is that none of those films were particularly great and other than the inclusion of Donald Pleasance as the avenging Dr. Loomis, they are most forgettable.

Not that this film is perfect mind you..it takes some awfully big leaps in logic.  It's supposed to be 20 years later and Laurie Strode is now the head-master of an exclusive private school.  Years ago she faked her death and took on the alias of Keri Tate in order to hide herself from her brother Michael.  But when papers of Dr. Loomis that reveal her true identity come up missing, the Shape is once again on her trail, bent on finishing the job he started 20 years earlier.

Josh Hartnett plays Strode's son John who is supposed to leave with most of the rest of the kids on a trip, but instead stays in the almost emply school grounds with his girlfriend and several other kids to have their own private party free from adults.  Naturally they are the first to encounter Michael Myers who manages to slip past the worlds worst security guard played by L.L. Cool J.

Despites some of the implausibilites of the script, it's the most effective thriller in the series since Halloween II.  The scene where Laurie manages to lock a door before michael can get her, but they still come face to face due to a window is a genuinely creepy scene.  Add to that is the fact that H20 Director Steve Minor was a far more experienced and accomplished director than the three guys who did the previous sequels and you have a far more effective film.

All in all, when if comes right down to it, this is the true Halloween 3!",1129680000,19,2022,4.400537634408602

986637,5,6305171769,"I loved Halloween H2O. The whole movie is scary from beginning to end and Michael looks spooky as ever with his haunting white mask. It is now 20 years later after Laurie Strode confronted Michael for the first time since back in 1978. I was so glad that Jamie Lee Curtis character came back to confront Michael again. She does a brilliant job at playing the powerful yet paranoid ""Laurie"".

The movie beginns with Nurse Marion Chambers who I thought was great to bring back into the Halloween movie franchise. She is an important character and I wish the directors would have given her more character development in the movie. Nurse Marion is from Halloween 1 and shows up near the of Halloween 2. She has been nursing Dr. Sam Loomis. It is now October 30th, 1998.  She comes home and notices that someone has broken into her home and has gone through some important files.  She lets 2 teens check her house out and we soon learn that Michael back. The opening credits show the movie title then 20 years later.  The Halloween music is back and you hear thunder in the background as the movie starts. You also  hear Dr. Sam Loomis's voice and he talks about Michael from 1978 during the credits.  Dr. Loomis's  room if full of newspaper archives from 1978 and 1980 regarding Laurie and the bloodbath that happened that Halloween night.  I thought this was a clever way to introduce the movie as we are all wondering where Laurie is.

Laurie is now grown up teaches at a secluded prestigious private school in Northern California and has changed her name to Keri Tate. She also has a 17 year old son John Tate played by Josh Harnett whom she has some problems with. ""Laurie""  still trying to move on from the past sees Michael in her imagination and dreams. She uses alcohol to try to numb the pain she indured 20 years ago. She also tries to confide in her boyfriend played by Adam Arkin but still has a difficult time talking about it.  Michael eventually finds "" Laurie"". What makes the movie more scarey is that Laurie and a few others are left all alone after all the kids from the school go to the Yosemite National Park for a weekend trip.  Everything is dark and quite now. Michael conventiantly gets past the security guard played by L.L. Cool Jay. The death scenes for the most part beginn here and they are all pretty intense as Michael goes from one victim to another. ""Laurie""  is finally forced to confront Michael but in order for her to face her fears she finally decides to turn the table on Michael and goes after him. She will do anything to save her son and his girlfrind Molly played by Michelle Williams.  She also knows that Michael can not be easily killed. The ending is mind blowing  and it will leave you with many questions. There are also 2 scenes in this movie which mimic Halloween 1 and there is a cameo by the late Janet Leah.  I really enjoyed this film it was highly entertaining to watch. The DVD also includes extras with interviews with Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Harnett, a quiz on how well you know the Halloween films and a rock video made for the movie. There is also an interesting interview with Moustapha Akkad where he talks about the Halloween film franchise and why Donald Pleasance wanted to do so more of them.",1125360000,,3255,4.491525423728813

986821,5,6305171769,"I avoided seeing this movie for years, appalled at the unpecedented way it just acted like nothing from ""Halloween II"" onward ever happened.  It's certainly not without precedent for a series to get its continuity mixed up after a number of sequels, but to actually try and delete several whole movies from the timeline?!?  It was only that trailers for ""Halloween Resurrection"" looked so good that I finally had to capitulate and take up the series again, finding to my shock that ""H20"" is actually one of the best chapters in the entire run, and, ironically, better than ""Resurrection"" would turn out to be.

I was never against Jamie Lee Curtis returning to the series as Laurie Strode, but I don't think it was necesary to skip over the several preceding entries.  As it is, there are now two seperate Halloween continuities - well, actually three because ""Season Of The Witch"" is out there on its own with no real connection to any of the others (it's kind of a shame they even called it ""Halloween III""; it was a great movie on its own that probably would have been much more appreciated if everybody hadn't been understandably befuddled about the abscence of Michael Myers et al.).  There's Halloween 1 & 2 plus 4 through 6 (released as ""The Curse Of The Michael Myers"" without a ""Part Six"" marker) and then we have a second timeline, again starting with Halloween Parts 1 & 2 but not picking up until H20 and those that follow it.  If anybody ever manages to stitch this all back together into a coherent single line God bless them.  To be fair, the H20 makers do make a bit of an acknowledgement to the 'skipped-over' installments - Laurie Strode faked her death in a car accident in this new continuity.  Those who remember the old continuity will recall that in Part 4 (which I believe may be my personal favorite) it was revealed in the opening minutes that Laurie was absent because she died in a car crash.  Couldn't they have gone one step further, made some referrence to Michael Myers copycat killers over the years between Part II and H20 and left us with the impression that the Thorn Cult arranged for things to be covered up so that everybody would believe Michael was dead and his appearances in 4-6 were somebody else (viewers would know better of course)?  But then that would have left the question of why Laurie left her daughter behind when she took up a new identity and life.  Maybe they just really had to go this way to tell this particular story that they wanted to tell.

And that story picks up twenty years after the night on which both Halloween and Halloween II took place, with Laurie, under her new name, well settled into a new life, with a teenage son and a job at a college, but still haunted by the irrational fear that someday Michael is going to return and track her down despite neither hide nor hair (nor Part 4, 5 or 6; but I guess I'm beating that point to death now) of him having been seen in two decades.  And after all those years, he does indeed once again Come Back.  Removed from most of the previous sequels, they've gone back to a Michael Myers not significantly more powerful than he was on the original Night, stronger and more unstoppable than any human should be but not to the extent he'd achieve in the later sequels; this plays well - in both H20 and Resurrection if he was still the force he was by Chapter 6 he'd carve through anything in his path like a hot knife through butter, both movies taking place (especially Resurrection) in a more confined envirornment.  Here that envirornment is an almost deserted college campus when just about everyone is off on an extended break, and because of his still formidable but much lesser power level the other side actually has a realistic fighting chance against him.

Fine cast and fine cast of characters: Jodi Lyn O'Keefe in particular stood out for me.  (While I'm on the subject of O'Keefe, one of horror's best actresses, can some distributor out there PLEASE release ""Red Rover"", which stars her,William Baldwin, Brenda James (aka Brenda Lynn Klemme of ""Cutting Class"" and ""The Channeller""!) and Charlie Rhindress either theatrically or on DVD?  It debuted in 2003 at film festivals, apparantly impressed both horror fans and non-horror fans, and it's still without wide distribution?  Don't let this be another Sector 13, which we're Still waiting for, after all these years...If Sector 13's copyright holder is listening?....still waiting, it's not too late.....still waiting......waiting....) Back to H20, the characters are all Likable, and all add to the movie with their own personalities.

H20 and all that follows are not a replacement for Halloween Parts 4-6; they exist In Addition to them and I've realized you don't have to choose one or the other.  Anybody still holding off on seeing this because of the continuity issue, don't keep making the mistake I made - this is a great movie no matter what the continuity.  And any newer fans who've Only seen 1 & 2 plus H20 and Resurrection, skipping the others because they're not part of the current timeline, you might want to consider going back and checking them out.  There's not a clunker among them, whether or not they ever end up linked back into the newer movies.  Same for Part III - a great movie that deserves to be judged on its own merits and not summarily dismissed because it's unconnected to the rest.",1121558400,,5395,4.666666666666667

The third film was a complete and utter waste of time that had absolutly NOTHING to do with Michael Myers, and parts 4,5, and 6 were all fair follow ups...However, with this addition, It only left me baffled and incredibly irritated that the writers have CONTINUED to mix the story lines up even more. What happened to Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode's character?? There were 3 films that involved her character and now those 3 films are supposed to basically just be null and void???

I hated that they just left those three films in the dust and had no reference or mention to whatever happened to Jamie Lloyd, and why all of a sudden her character has never existed after we invested 3 movies into her (she did die in the 6th film though, so that was a bummer)...Also, this movie was just boring. There is something entirely cheesy about this movie that I can't seem to put my finger on. The directing is far too over the top and glossy looking. Horror movies of today seem to lack what slasher films of the 70's and 80's had in grainy and eerie lighting and camera work. The crisp pictures and smooth camera movements seem to take away that extra BAM! of horror. The writing for this movie is awful and the characters are hard to connect to. Jamie Lee Curtis is even hard to connect to. That is probably due to the fact that she has become a hardened, oppresive, and dull LUSH with a bevy of emotional issues (no thanks to her immortal psycho killing machine brother). Even worse than this film though is the follow up-Halloween Resurrection, which is barely even tolerable to sit through once. I hope that part 9 is at least somewhat decent...although I don't have any idea where they are going to venture with the story line.",1119312000,3,1848,4.486646884272997
986823,4,6305171769,"We have enjoyed the first six installments to the most popular film in horror history: HALLOWEEN. Now, it is time that we watch HALLOWEEN: H20-TWENTY YEARS LATER, the seventh installment to this terrifying series.

  It is now October 29, 1998, twenty years since the events of the Haddonfield's nightmare. In Langen, Illinois, NURSE MARION CHAMBERS-WINNINGTON (again played by Nancy Stephens), who had accompanied the late Dr. Loomis in the first two films, is residing happily. She comes home from work to find that her house was just broken into. She walks next door and runs into her 15-year-old neighbor, JIMMY HOWELL (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and his friend, TONY ALLEGRE (played by Brandon Williams). He has her stay at his house, while he calls the police. But Jimmy has no patience in waiting for the police to show up. He enters Marion's house and decides to look around, making sure everything is in order and that whoever had broken in is now gone. While on the search, Jimmy steals two beers.

  He exits the house and claims that everything is A-OKAY. Jimmy and Tony head over to Jimmy's house, as Marion enters hers. The lights are not working, forcing Marion to get a flashlight. With the flashlight in hand, she enters her office, in which Jimmy said was ransacked like you wouldn't believe. There is a file folder on Marion's desk that reads LAURIE STRODE. She opens the folder and sees that the file on Laurie is gone. That is when MICHAEL MYERS (played by Chris Durand) appears behind her. She runs next door to find Jimmy and Tony dead. Michael appears in the house and begins chasing Marion all over. That is when the cops arrive. She tries beating Michael with a poker, but that doesn't work, for he slashes Marion's throat.

  Waking up from a nightmare is...LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Laurie had faked her death and had gone into hiding, with a new identity and a new name: KERI TATE. Lives with her son JOHN (played by Josh Hartnett). The next morning, HALLOWEEN, where Laurie and John reside in Summer Glen, CA, with John attending a HILCREST ACADEMY PRIVATE SCHOOL, with Laurie as the headmistress, they discuss John wanting to go on the school camping trip, but Laurie does not want him to go.

  John meets up with his friend, CHARLIE DEVERAUX (played by Adam Hann-Byrd), Charlie's girlfriend SARAH WAINTHROPE (played by Jodi Lynn O'Keefe), and John's girlfriend, MOLLY CARTWELL (played by Michelle Williams). Charlie and Sarah are refusing to go the camping trip, while Molly and John are trying to go, but they all decide to stay behind and have a Halloween party.

  Laurie heads over to her office with WILL BRENNAN (played by Adam Arkin), the school's counselor, and Laurie's lover. They pass Laurie's secretary, NORMA WATSON (played by Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's mother) and head into Laurie's office, where they confirm their lunch at 1:00.

  Laurie and Will have their lunch, where we see that Laurie has become an alcoholic. Everything she has tried to rid herself of the memories does not work, except for drinking. As she leaves to get back to the school, she runs into John and Charlie. She yells at John, forcing him to yell back, in saying that her not handling the 20-year old memories is driving him insane. They head back to the school, where Laurie, feeling some sympathy, let's RONNIE JONES (played by LL Cool J), the school gatekeeper, off the hook for letting the guys loose.

  As Molly and John talk, Laurie gives John the permission to go on the trip, but John throws away the permission slip and goes on with his friends plan to have their Halloween party.

  Laurie is closing up for the night and heading home, where she again sees another apparition of Michael. She continues to erase the image, but he just won't disappear until Will surprises her. He asks to drop by for the evening, wanting to keep Laurie company for the night.

  John, Molly, Sarah, and Charlie arrive at the school for their party. Charlie goes off to find a corkscrew. Sarah goes off to find him and see what is taking so long. They talk briefly as Charlie goes upstairs and meets Michael. Sarah finds Charlie's dead body and runs away from Michael, but he catches her and kills her. John and Molly find their friends dead bodies and they run from Michael.

  Laurie, Will, and Ronnie are checking out the school, when Will and Laurie hear Molly and John screaming for someone to let them in. Will sees someone walking up the stairs. Thinking its Michael, he shoots at him, but it turns out to be Ronnie. At that moment, Michael appears and kills Will. Laurie hits Michael in the head with fire extinguisher, grabs the kids and runs out. They get into Laurie's car and drive over to the school gate. Laurie has Molly and John drive down a mile, call the police for help, while she locks herself in and fights her brother one final time.

  They have a brief battle, where Michael slices Laurie's left arm in the same spot he did twenty years ago. She grabs two knifes and stabs the sh*t out of him until he is unconscious, but seemingly dead. She tries to stab him one final time, but Ronnie comes and stops her. The bullet only grazed Ronnie's head, so fortunately, Ronnie is fine.

  Laurie drives off with Michael, where they end up on the side of a hill. Trying to reach out to his little sister, Laurie grabs an axe and decapitates her brother, killing him once and for all.

  I was a little disappointed with this, since the late Dr. Loomis, is nowhere to be found, as well as this one being set in California, instead of Haddonfield, Illinois. The film is not scary as I hoped, but it is a worthy sequel.",1117584000,2,5674,4.647294589178356

Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin, LL Cool J, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Michelle Williams, Adam Hann-Byrd, Lyn O'Keefe.

Rated R for graphic violence, language, minor sexual situations and gore.

Running Time:  90 minutes.

Director Steve Miner (""Friday the 13th, Part III"", ""Forever Young"") uses his similar, stylish tactics of his early 1980's ""Friday the 13th"" thrillers in this exceptional sequel. Now twenty years after the original Halloweens took place (basically forgetting sequels 3-6, thank God), Michael Myers returns to inflict even more terror on Laurie (reprised by scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in a fine performance).  Laurie struggles to put the fear of Michael away, even after two decades have passes since that dreadful night her deranged brother returned to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill her.

An alcoholic headmistress of her graduating son's (played by Josh Hartnett) private school, Laurie dreads the upcoming infamous fall holiday.  With the support from love interest Arkin (""Chicago Hope""), Laurie is coerced to believe that nothing bad is going to happen--until the dead bodies start to pile up.  As Laurie attempts to save her son from the horrific monster that is Myers, school security guard LL Cool J comes to the rescue.  The battle between good and evil leads to an exceptional climax in which Laurie takes on Michael herself in order to end the mayhem once and for all.

While not up to the caliber of the original, ""Halloween: H20"" makes up for the unfortunate loss of Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance, who passed away after during filming of the previous sequel) with excellent supporting roles from the charismatic LL Cool J and the underrated Arkin.  Full of chills and thrills, Steve Miner does a fine job setting up the shocks with his deliberate use of camera angles and a frightening musical score.  The opening scene is perhaps one of the most terrifying of all time.  One of the better slasher films of the ""Scream"" era.",1115856000,,2008,5.09480122324159

986861,4,6305171769,"Halloween H20 is the seventh movie of the Halloween series and is in my opionion the best since the first one mainly due to the return of Jamie Lee Curtis. The only down side is that there is no Dr Sam Loomis due to the unfortunete passing of Donald Plescense. In case of confusion, H20 is not really linked to H4, H5 and H6 and is more linked to John Carpender's opening two Halloween movies.

The story is based of Laurie Strode, now named Keri Tate having faked her death. She is now head mistress of a high school in Summer Glen, California. She is still suffering the trauma of her ordeal in 1978 and as Halloween approaches is having nightmares and seing reflections of her maniac brother Michael Myers. But of course, Myers tracks her down and Strode is now in a desperate situation to save herself and her son John.

This is a good movie, without being overly good. It's well acted and well script and the story line is excellent. I would not recommend this film for anyone who hasn't seen the first two movies. I also like the fact that the movie goes back to basics like the first two movies rather than all the rubbish about the 'thorn' constellation in the last movie.",1108944000,3,1180,4.408256880733945

986863,4,6305171769,"A very ""tight"" movie - can't recall a single bit of ""fluff"" - action/story moved right along.

They could have made this longer - even by adding ""fluff"" - without hurting the over all quality.

A good scary movie - and one where you don't feel exhausted after watching it.

I especially like how Laurie Strode sees her brother stalking her in reflective surfaces or even broad daylight; She closes her eyes and takes a breath (or several) to make the hallucination go away - the viewer keeps watching wondering when she's going to try this and find out that he's really finally tracked her down!!

I give this only 4 of 5 stars for the following reasons:
* They briefly teased us into thinking JLC's boyfriend was posing as MM to mess with her mind and then stopped. Would have been awesome if they could have developed this area more and kept us guessing longer.
* LL COOL J played the security guard - what a waste of a good story character. They could have had any 'unknown' take this part and make something good of it - he just created a distraction to the point where I was glad someone shot him.

Wonderful detail and references to other horror movies woven into the fabric of this film - watch the Bonus material!

Michael Myers is back with 2 things on his mind, killing his sister Laurie and killing everyone that gets in his path.  Laurie has many flashbacks of her brother in the beginning of the film until, she is face to face with him in a window of a door.  Josh Hartnett plays Laurie's son John and does a pretty good job as a newcomer to the big screen.  This movie I thought was a very good one and tries to stick with the original formula of the first one.  However, very inferior to the one that started it all.  IMO, absolutely no horror movie will ever surpass Halloween, period!  If you are new to the Halloween series I would STRONGLY suggest watching the first and second ones before this.

986867,5,6305171769,"The series has gone through many blows, and although I liked 4 & 5, many fans will state that the franchise was dead by part 2...until now.  I think after the HUGE failure of Halloween 6, both with fans and normal viewers, Mustapha Akkad decided to go back to the basics to make a decent film.  This new installment brings back what we loved from the first film and updates it with its own ""style"" which ulitimately makes it a great sequel.

As it turns out, Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) isn't dead, she's actually a dean in California!  What's more, she's now got a son, John (Josh Hartnett) to go along with her life!  After an old counselor of Strode's is killed, Michael discovers that his sister isn't dead and exactly where she lives.  On the weekend that Michael arrives, the school Laurie works for is on a class trip and the only remaining people are her, John, and some of his friends and staff which makes a classic setting for a refresher in becoming the scared babysitter all over again!  When Laurie first comes face to face with Michael she almost thinks it's her mind playing tricks on her, but it quickly becomes much more real and horrifying from the moment she finds that he is no delusion!

This movie re-vamped the ""formula"" to making a successful slasher film and even brought back some aspects of a successful Halloween film and the result was incredible.  The storyline is tight, no holes, and simple, which keeps it very close to the original.  The use of music and shadows also bring back a sense of boogeyman in Michael and having the hole campus empty gave plenty of room to be realistic!  The body count is quite low, but again that's what made this movie better!  Jamie Lee Curtis comes back after 20 years and proves that she's still got what it takes to be crowned the ""scream queen"" of horror.  Additional cast members also help bring this movie to life with modern idols like Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams, and my personal favorite: L.L. Cool J!  This movie took what they'd done in the past, updated it, and made a sequel that is worthy of being compared to the original.

The DVD is a decent collector's edition, but we've been spoiled in the past by films that we knew little about, and unfortunately H20 got plenty of press coverage.  It's got a fun featurette, but nothing that compares to the behind the scenes work for the original or parts 4 & 5.  The movie itself is presented in widescreen with surround sound which preserves that cold chill I felt in the theatre when I went to see it (and I'm not talking about the air conditioning)!  Fans of the series don't need to be told at this point to pick this up and horror fans can honestly get away with this and the original for your collection.  All around movie fans may want to rent first as this is still a ""slasher"" film.",1093392000,,2824,4.4911937377690805
986868,4,6305171769,"I am a die-hard Halloween fan, but not a die-hard fan of the franchise.  As far as I'm concerned Halloween does not need any sequels and I can do just fine without them, but Halloween II unravels the mystery posed in Halloween (though John Caprenter never originally intended any sequels or plot twists), and Halloween H20 throws in a nice alternative ending to the one we were offered in Halloween II with the supposed demise of Dr. Sam Loomis and Michael Audrey Myers (the Shape).

But H20 has some annoying flaws:
1.  The sound track is awful; it completely lacks ""atmosphere"" and is a mix of Psycho, Halloween and Scream, and an odd assortment of orchestral noises and Rock/Hip-Hop that do not mesh well together.  Halloween 1-4 all had excellent soundtracks though Halloween III was more ""synthetic"" than any of them.
2.  Unlike Halloween and Halloween II Michael Myers needlessly murders a few people, most of them in the opening sequence.  If you recall the first two films, he killed out of necessity; to eliminate obstacles or to create lures (except in the case of the one girl he killed at the beginning of Halloween II.  He must have been just a little irritated for having been shot by Dr. Loomis).  But as with every Myers sequel since then he just sort of kills for the sake of killing.
3.  The opening scenes had all of the look and feel of the original Halloween, especially with the opening theme of Mr. Sandman.  It was saturated with ""atmosphere.""  Unfortunatley it faded quickly and never returned as the story shifts from Illinois to California.  Halloween and all the other sequels made much better use of shadows and lighting than this one, probably because of light filters or the lack of.  Halloween had a lot of blue effect and made use of a dimmer switch in the scene where Michael seems to materialize out of the darkness behind Laurie.  The same dimmer switch lighting technique was used in Halloween II when Michael faded in out of nowhere and grabbed Janet.  H20 did not make the best possible use of ""atmosphere"" though it was an admirable attempt.
4.  There were a few annoying plot holes.  Where has Michael been all these years?  How did he drive from Illinois to California in a day and a half--with a stolen car--without drawing the attention of every law enforcement agency in the region?  A photo and newspaper clipping about Laurie's daughter, Jamie, is on Dr. Loomis' wall at the beginning of the movie but no mention is made of her in the story.  What happened to that family history?  It does not line up with the previous three sequels although it does not entirely ignore them either.
5.  There is too much graphic violence of a silly nature (like an ice skate through the head and the girl who is strung up from the ceiling with a light bulb in her carcass).
6.  Michael Myers was not quite so menacing as in the first two movies.  Part of the problem is that the mask lacks character.  The features are much more ""pale"" and muted, more like Star Trek's Commander Data than William Shatner.  The wild hair didn't help either.  Also we see Michael's eyes all the time; a minor but important detail.  His eyes were rarely seen in Halloween and Halloween II, thus adding immensely to the concept of personified evil.  Michael's breathing cannot be heard and he does not make the obscure grunting noises he made in Halloween when he was struggling to kill someone.  Halloween II lacked this small but important detail as well.  Although I did not expect a repeat of the first two films, I do think a lot of the details that helped make the first film a huge success and the second one stand up fairly well are consistently overlooked in the other installments of this series.

Here are some of the high points of H20:
1.  We revisit an old character, Nurse Marion, who was in Halloween (the rainy station wagon ride with Dr. Sam Loomis) and also in Halloween II (the ride in the Federal Marshall's car).
2.  The writers put a lot more effort into making a serious horror film.  The filmography is outstanding and the acting is top notch; true cinema, not a cheap cheesy horror rip-off.
3.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the central character once again, and this time she faces Michael head-on and on purpose.

H20 is certainly worth owning and a worthy addition to the Halloween series.  It is the closest return attempt to the original plot and seriousness since Halloween II.  It just lacks the element of creepiness that the old team of Carpenter, Hill, and Cundey were able to create, primarily because the original team had real eyes and ears for effective detail.  The latter teams have just written and filmed stories with very little regard to what puts the creepy in Halloween.

The H20 disk is certainly a fine quality product.  The imagery is sharp, the sound is crystal clear, and the interview with Jamie Lee Curtis, Moustapha Akkaad, and John Carpenter is entertaining enough though not really anything new informationally.  Take H20 or leave it...it really does not matter though it is a fine film.

My actual rating of H20 would be 3 1/2 stars.  Halloween II was much better and offered a completely acceptable end to the series.",1092700800,,5179,4.649064906490649

986925,4,6305171769,"I've always enjoyed the Halloween movies, but in the past there have been mistakes. However, H20 tries to fix that, by offering a good dose of horror. The beginning is somewhat weak, and seems like the director added it in to up the body count, but still you have to start somewhere. After the first two murders occur[ one being very gruesome, in which a character gets an ice skate shoved through his face]. The cops flock to the murder scene, and discover that Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse has been murdered, and that the file on Laurie Strode has been stolen. We then go to a prep school in California, where it is one day before Halloween, and Miss Strode is having quite a hard time recovering over what happened 20 years ago. She is the headmistress of a private school, and we meet her son Josh. Josh is very annoyed by her mother's overprotectivness. It doesn't help that it is one day before Halloween. Josh wants to go on a camping trip, but can't seem to persuade his mother to let him go. So, him and his friends decide to arrange a gettogether at the prep school after everyone else leaves, but Josh's mom decides to let him go to the camping trip, so he takes the slip but doesn't leave. Laurie then discovers that Halloween night that her sons camping items are still in the house and comes to the realization that Josh is in trouble, and her brother is coming back to get him. It is at this point that what we have all been waiting for happens. Michael shows up at the school. In this movie, Laurie finally conquers her fears and faces her maniac brother. Good acting, good writing, and all in all a good movie. I had to give it 4 stars because the middle is a little slow in some parts, and the movie entirely ignores 4, 5, and Curse, but some people may enjoy that.

986927,4,6305171769,"In 1978, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" became one of the largest and the most successful independant motion picture of all time. It was scary, clever, well acted, and entertaining. While several slasher sequels followed (""Halloween II"" (1981), ""Halloween III: Season on the Witch"" (1983), ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" (1988), ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" (1989), and ""Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers"" (1995)) none were as good, nor scary as the original. ""Halloween H20"" is not as good or scary as the original, but it comes darn close. Being often discriminated, ""H20"" is an entertaining movie with some good points including a good cast and some great thrills, but the only problem is its inconsistansies with the rest of the ""Halloween"" series. If you're scared and want a treat on Halloween night, then rent a ""Halloween"" movie, and you might find ""H20"" the one you like.
First of all, the cast of ""Halloween H20"" is amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis steals the show in an unstoppable fashion. She has flipped the character of Lourie Strode around so much from the original's shy geeky Lourie to ""H20's"" tough and serious Lourie. Now an alchaholic head mistress at a private school in California (the only ""Halloween"" not in Haddonfield!). She has a son named John (Josh Hartnet) who is dating a blonde babe named Molly (Michelle Williams) and whose two friends are Sarah (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd). Laurie also is seeing someone (since her husband, who I believe may have been Jimmy from ""Halloween II"", and her are now seperated). The guy she is seeing is the school guidance councelor Will (Adam Arkin). Michael Myers is played by Chris Durand. Also in the cast are LL Cool J as Ronny the school security guard and Marion Whittington (Nancy Stevens) who appeared in both ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"". Although all the actors are good at their roles, Jamie Lee Curtis steal the show. She is the new Dr. Loomis- the hero of the story. Her final confrontation with Michael Myers is legendary. Curtis has also done a great job with every role, and it is visible in this movie how she has matured as an actress from the orignal ""Halloween"" to now. It is a common fact that most horror films have bad actors, but this movie doesn't- it has a great cast.
Secondly, this movie has an assortment of good thrills, chills, and scares. Not as scary as the first, but still a jumpy thriller, ""H20"" makes its mark in the horror industry. The beginning is the scariest part of the movie, and all throughout the movie you keep expecting Michael Myers to pop up out of no where and kill someone. For instance, Lourie is having visions and nightmares where she sees Michael coming. But how does she know if its really him or not. Another good scare would be when Michael is stalking John, Molly, Sarah, and Charlie while they all are at the school when it is closed down. ""Halloween H20"" is scary and jittery, but is fun to watch, and will not give you nightmares.
Finally, even with a great cast and some good scares, ""Halloween H20"" has a major flaw. It totally forgets about ""Halloween 4"", ""Halloween 5"", and ""Halloween 6"". ""H20"" makes it seem as if Michael has been anonymous for the last 20 years ever since ""Halloween II"" ended. Of course there would be no mention of ""Halloween III"" since it had nothing to do with Michael Myers. This is not good because yes, ""Halloween 5"" and ""Halloween 6"" were somewhat weak, but ""Halloween 4"" was a good movie, even better than ""H20"". And even if the sequels were all bad, they are still apart of the series, and therefore must not be forgotten. For instance, Lourie's daughter Jamie from ""Halloween 4"" was not mentioned at all in this movie, and with the introduction of John, Jamie's story is a little confusing. Another bad connection would be that Michael Myers had no burns on him, which is strange considering that in ""Halloween II"" he was nearly burned to death. The character of Dr. Loomis is only mentioned once, and his death is made unclear, saying he 'died' a few years ago, while in fact, he was murdered by Michael Myers in 1995. There are several other noticable flaws connecting this movie with the rest of the series, and that alone somewhat ruins the movie for any real ""Halloween"" fan.
To conclude, this movie is awesome with its good cast and thrilling writing, but it lacks as a part of the ""Halloween"" 'series'. This is, however, a great movie to watch. It is very entertaining, and if you can put its flaws behind, then you should enjoy it almost as much as the original. Jamie Lee Curtis and her supporting cast are great, there are some suspenseful and jumpy parts, and this movie is overall a typical slasher flick of the 90's. The film also just goes to show that even 20 years later, the ""Halloween"" series is still making a killing in the horror industry, which is more than can be said for ""Friday the 13th"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Get scared today, and buy ""Halloween H20"" to complete your ""Halloween"" collection.",1088035200,,5036,4.6851015801354405
986928,2,6305171769,"It seems that the only reason people say that this is the best Halloween sequel, and that it matches the style of the original, yadda, yadda, yadda, is because Jaime Lee Curtis revives her role as Laurie Strode. It is WAY overrated, and it truly boggels me why so many people give it *** stars and up. It's not scary AT ALL, and it doesn't even LOOK like it's taking place on Halloween. And it's just BORING. But I really can't give it under two stars. It's just not THAT bad. I wouldint reccomend it unless you feel you must watch every Halloween movie.",1087603200,5,554,4.336538461538462
986929,4,6305171769,"Firstly, for all of you who keep referencing all of the halloween sequels to the first, please stop. As we all know, there will never be another halloween as good as the first(as long as they keep making them), so please don't be dissapointed when the sequels aren't as good as the original. Ok, now with that said, i believe this is one of the better sequels (notice i didn't compare it to the first) in the halloween series. In this one, the actor who plays Michael(the shape), seems to have studied Michaels moves and bodily expressions from previous films and, in my opinion, improved on them. This actor was by far my favorite to have played Michael. It was somewhat a standalone movie from the previous sequels that really held it's own. I thought the acting was very good(even for the not so well known actors/actresses) and of course Jaime Lee always does a great job. The only complaint i have is that no one (the director or the writers) made any mention of Laurie's other child(the one from sequels 4,5,&6) but, maybe for good reason. I liked halloween 4,5,&6 but, this one put the series back in the spotlight as far as i'm concerned. We have finally had a horror icon(Freddy) vs. horror icon(Jason) but, now let's have a horror legend(Michael) vs. horror icon(Jason). Just thought i would add that for all of you horror fans out there who would like to see that one. Well anyway, i would definitely recommend this one to any halloween fan.

986931,4,6305171769,"It took almost 20 years for Jamie Lee Curtis to return to the role that made her famous, but it was worth the wait. ""Halloween: H20"" is a great suspense film but doesn't have the psyhcological grip that the original has.
For Laurie Strode, life has been a rough road since 10/31/78. The head mistress of a private school in California and the mother of a teenage son, Laurie drinks her life away as a closet alcoholic trying to forget that awful Halloween night of long ago. She better get a grip though, because the past is about to rear its ugly head in the form of Michael Myers, who wants to meet his nephew, and get a little payback.
Steve Miner, who directed and created the ""Friday the 13th"" films, directs ""H20"" after John Carpenter declined (he once said ""How can you make a sequel to a film that doesn't need one?""). The cast is great and is one of the best slasher casts I've seen since ""Scream"" (especially, Janet Leigh who stars as Curtis' secretary in the film, complete with the style car she drove in ""Psycho""). Josh Hartnett makes his film debut here as Michael's nephew and Michelle Williams plays his girlfriend.",1078444800,,1131,4.521951219512195

Even if your a Jason fan you'll hate this movie. The next one is much better. Okay, the so called story is Larie( Jamie Lee Curts) FAKED her death in a car crash that was in Halloween 4. She then moved to Californea. But Michael Myers gets a profile and goes to Californea in one day! O yeah, if you want to see this film because Jamie Lee Curtis is in it, let warn you that her charator is COMPLTELY diffrent then her charactor in Halloween 1-2. Anyway, after about an hour of nothing happing, michael Finally kills someone. From that point on they steal most of the seancens frome the fourth film.

986977,4,6305171769,I hadn't seen any other Halloween besides 1 and 2 when I saw this and if my review had happened a month ago I would have a different opinion. Laurie Strode acts as if she only had one child. For some of us who have seen the middle ones know that she had a daughter Jamie who died in the 6th film. I feel that there should have been more regard to the middle films instead of a 3 minute insult to Dr. Loomis. And Laurie must be some kind of pyscho to get out of that car to go fight Michael and even then she runs away. If anybody noticed when she told her son and his girlfriend to go to that persons house down the road that was excaltly like when she told the boy and girl she was babysitting to run down the street in the first one. I thought that was kind of cool. Anyway this movie was good and the 5th best in the series,1075161600,,826,3.864705882352941

HALLOWEEN H20 is a roller-coaster ride and had me on the edge of my seat, even during the opening credits. Jamie Lee Curtis, who suggested this project, turns in an excellent performance, as does the supporting cast. The music score adds to the incredible tension of this sequel which is actually better than HALLOWEEN II, but of course, not as good as the first. The script is written for maximum suspense, though it does seem that it relies a little too heavily on false alarms. Otherwise, this is an amazing movie. Well crafted, well scripted, well acted, well scored, well shot and well directed. It's an excellent movie.

Very highly recommended!",1068249600,,286,5.173913043478261
986981,5,6305171769,"Too often, producers create a movie that has mass appeal, and so sequels are produced, often compromising quality of material for speed of release.  The Halloween franchise, created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, met with this fate.  The original Halloween, a stylized slasher film that changed the horror genre forever, became a marketing tool for a series of sequels that attempted to cash in on the first film's success.  The storyline was re-tooled again and again, and with each effort, the Halloween series fell apart, becoming more ridiculous with each film that was released.
Halloween H20, the seventh sequel in the series, might have met with much the same fate as its predecessors, but that due to a recent resurgance of popularity in the horror genre with movies like ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", Hollywood focused its attention on creating a sequel that would have the same slick feel as these other films, while remaining true to the Halloween storyline that Carpenter created 20 years before.
They succeeded.
Halloween H20, with help from veteran screen writer Kevin Williamson (Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer), and starring a young, fresh cast of rising talent; Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), L.L. Cool J, Michelle Williams (Dawson's Creek) & Adam Arkin (Chicago Hope) gave the film a fresh look that made it marketable to a new audience of moviegoers.  The greatest success of the movie though, was that it re-introduced us to the original heroine of the film, Laurie Strode, by bringing back veteran actress Jamie Lee Curtis to reprise the role that made her famous.
The storyline, which largely ignored most of the story developed in sequels 3-6, continued the narrative of Strode, who went into hiding by changing her identity to Keri Tate.  Now the headmaster of a private school in California, a mother to John Tate (Hartnett) and a functioning alcoholic, Laurie struggles to overcome the experiences that changed her life when Michael Myers came after her in Haddonfield 20 years earlier.  Her paranoia often gets the better of her, and she sees Michael everywhere-in her mirror, out her window, in her dreams.
When John asks permission to go on a school field trip during the weekend of Halloween, Strode is unwilling to let him go.  Frustrated and angered, John confronts her, insisting that her paranoia is inhibiting his growth.  Strode insists that she is only being cautious, but John lashes out, leaving in anger.  Later he learns that his girlfriend and other close friends are going to remain behind as well, and so they instead decide to have a small party of their own on campus.
But Michael is coming.  Having learned of Laurie's whereabouts after breaking into the home of Marion Whittington, (Nancy Stephens (who was featured in the original Halloween films)), Dr. Loomis's nurse, and stealing the file on Laurie Strode, he heads out to where she has been hiding for the past 20 years.
The movie works because it is fresh, hip, and fast-paced.  It doesn't meander with long, drawn out, dis-jointed murder scenes like some of the earlier films, but instead deals with the characters, providing a level of depth and understanding that makes the audience sympathetic to their plight.  Of course, the audience of these films are clamoring for Michael Myers, and they won't be disappointed.  Though the body count in this film is far less than its predecessors, the murder sequences are intenese and genuinely frightening.
H20 really delivers the goods and is a satisfying continuation of the story that Carpenter created with the original Halloween.  Featuring a cameo by Janet Leigh, Curtis's mother and star of the original ""Psycho"", this movie is fun, clever with its tongue-in-cheek dialogue between Curtis and Leigh, and down-right frightening, giving audiences a return to Halloween that might keep the franchise alive another 20 years.",1067904000,,3915,5.040247678018575

Laurie has a family now and teahces at a prep school, and Michael finds her. As claas trip over the weekend leaves 4 kids alone in the dorms ( Lauries Son included ), so there aren't a lot of deaths, but the ones that do occure are done brillantly. After her sons life is threatened, Lauries decides to face her fears and fights her brother.

987028,4,6305171769,"Okay I am a big fan of the Halloween films, and I will have to give you a little history of the Halloween films, before I will give you my input on H20. Okay the first Halloween was a classic, when we are introdcued to the boogeyman Michael Myers who escapes from a mental instution and goes on a killing spree in Haddonfield and almost tries to kill his sister Lauire Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). The second film, Halloween II is a contuation of the first. We see that Michael Myers was not killed in the first film and tracks Laurie Strode all the way to the hospital where he tries to ensue his finally move. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) tries to warn everyone about how evil he is. Michael Myers is burned. Okay lets skip ahead a year or two later, and for some stupid reason we have Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, which has nothing to do with Michael Myers. Now lets go even further to the late 80's where the next real Halloween film is released, HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERs. Kind of a soggy campy film with no taste and can't live up to the orignial. Michael Myers apparently has been in acoma for 10 years since his crispy escapid in II. He awakens on a killing spree of teens looking for his seven year old niece - Jamie Llyod. Of course, Dr. Loomis returns to Haddonfield after a 10 year absence to find Michael Myers once again. The film ends with a fiery show down and Michael is buried. But his niece is haunted by the unspeakable evil her uncle has, and stabs her Mom with a pair of siccors. Okay lets skip one year later, to Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. This is even more dumb then 4.  Jamie Llyod is placed in Haddonfield's Children's Hopsital, after attacking her mother with a pair of siccors. Jamie is being treated by Dr. Loomis along with her foster sister Rachel and her friend Tina, until Michael Myers come back once again, after a year in acoma after 4. Dr. Loomis decides the only way to end all of this is to lure Michael to the Myers house with Jamie. But a man in black has arrived in town with a startling connection to Michael. Lets skip ahead 7 years later, with the scariest Halloween film of all - Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. It's now six years since the last Halloween celebration in Haddonfield. Michael Myers, his niece Jamie, and the mysterious Man in Black all disappeared after the explosive end of Part 5. Everyone assumes them all to be dead...but actually, Jamie has been captured by the Man In Black, who has her impregnated her. A now grown up Jamie delievers the baby on Halloween eve. But Michael is back, and is looking for her and her baby. Jamie dies, and a hunt goes on to protect the baby with the help of Dr. Loomis. The Man in Black is a good old friend to Dr. Loomis who holds a cult of unspeakable evil that Myers can't escape. Okay let's skip two more years later, where we finally have Halloween 7, offically titled Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later. We are introduced back to Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curits) who teaches at a private school, and stays safetly seculded, under the name of Keri Tate. Just as she is getting back to her old self, Michael once again reappears in her life wanting to finish off what he did in the beginning. Michael at first ransacks Dr. Loomis office in Haddonfield which he has passed away between the Curse of Michael Myers and H20. (And in real life, RIP Donald Pleasence) The film ends as Michael butchers a bunch of teens leaving a conclusion that Laruie chops his head off and finally puts her past away - FOR THE MOMENT. Halloween H20 was probably the best Halloween sequel with the best story, but it's not the scariest. Miramax should have ended the sereis with H20 and the franchise wouldn't have spoiled. Instead they made the stupid, Halloween 8: Resurrection. Which is really dumb. Supposidly, that wasn't Michael who she killed in H20. Of course Laurie finally kills herself before Michael can get to her and a bunch of people are murdered in a Halloween party. Then Miramax is planning a Halloween 9.

The film complete forgets the fact that Lorrie had a Daughter who featured in the Halloweens 4 through 6 and instead gives her a son (Josh Hartnett) who secretly stays at a bording school when his mother thinks he has gone on a school trip.

Nevertheless, I persisted through the series, and while the Michael Myers movies were, in all, not bad, nor do I feel they are anything out of the ordinary. I mean, honestly - psycho stalks victims, victims run around screaming, victims die horribly, last remaining victim manages to turn tables on psycho and kill him, usually by pure fluke, and never permanently.
Then Halloween H20 came along, and boy, do I wish I had gone to see this one in the cinema.
Other reviewers have varying opinions, especially where the middle slew of films is concerned. It is a big complaint that H20 basically ignores the existence of film sequels #3 through #6. I admit that I particularly enjoyed sequels #4 & #5, with the introduction of Laurie's niece, Jamie, and her psychic connection to the infamous Michael. But I don't think it detracts at all from H20 to pass over those middle films. (especially #3, which does not even have Michael in it!)
H20 begins in an unspecified town, at the home of the nurse who was Dr Loomis' carer until his death. Although it indicates that Laurie Strode was killed in an accident years ago, Michael Myers clearly believes otherwise. In a nicely chilling opening scene, Michael brutally murders two teenage boys and the nurse after raiding Loomis' old files. No three guesses who he's looking for...
There is plenty to enjoy in this film. We are reintroduced to Laurie 20 years on from her terrifying Halloween night experiences with her psychotic brother, now with a new identity and enough emotional trauma to to put any psychotherapist on the back foot.
She is a single mum and a closet alcoholic, who suffers severe nightmares, and frequent moments of hallucination, seeing images of her brother everywhere.
The premise is simple enough. The school of which she is headmistress is all but empty as 95% of the students head off on a school trip. There are only 7 people in total left in the grounds - Laurie, her boyfriend, school guard LL Cool J, and the four students who didn't go on the camp.
Steve Miner does an excellent job of setting the scene, and manages to pull off a film in the end that is not simply another standard slash & hack.
Somewhere in the middle of her own neuroses, Laurie finds the courage to use what she knows about Michael to try and turn the tables on him. And in all honesty, it gives me chills every time to watch her striding up the driveway, axe in hand, yelling her brother's name.
It's about time we were given a victim who refused to be a victim.
The final scene between the two main (and original) characters was almost touching, although it's a fair bet that had Laurie actually taken Michael's hand, he probably would have dragged her in and broken her neck.
Shame on them for doing what they did in the next film, and devaluing Laurie's brave actions so much. They should have left well enough alone, and ended the series with the outstanding H20.",1064188800,,3178,4.676785714285714

While she tries to prepare and have a good time, Michael has found files leading him right to her, after chasing Marion (the nurse from the first and second film) through her house (The best scene in the film, in my opinion). So he heads cross country in a little green fruit truck to California, and the terror begins.
H20 is probably the most respectful sequel in the Halloween franchise. A few good chase scenes and jumps make this move worth watching.

987035,2,6305171769,"In a move similiar to ""Godzilla 1985"", this Halloween film dumps its last three or so sequels and starts over fresh from the second film. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as the heroine from said movies. She has faked her death and is now the headmistress of a private school in California. She has a mischeivous son (played by Josh Hartnett) who is hoping to go on a field trip but Mom's past has made her very protective of her family.
Of course, Michael Myers is not dead. He has been waiting twenty years for another chance to murder his sister. He also spends a good deal of time going after her son and his buddies. Not to mention LL Cool J as the token black guy. He's the security guard who has more depth than most because he is trying to write cheesy love novels.
The aura of horror once surrounded with Michael Myers is lost. Without acknowledging the other sequels, this whole story seems messy. Myers is not menacing. He feels more like the killer from ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legend"" here. It is Curtis who becomes this sort of ""Liuetenant Ripley"" super female. In the fourth and fifth Halloween films, Michael was this sort of evil force who could not be stopped. He attacked in claustrophobic situations and the story very rarely gave control over to his victims. Here, he is just a man in a mask who seems to get ""starstruck"" everytime someone from a big movie or TV show crosses his path. Kevin Williamson's involvment in this project is far too obvious. He doesn't seem to have a good understanding of what made Michael Myers scary. ""Halloween"" worked a lot better when there was legitimate fear of what Michael Myers stood for. Curtis spends twenty years in fear of this indivual, only to transform into a femme fatale after running from him for about a half an hour. It is amazing that Steve Miner who did an excellent job with the early ""Friday The 13th"" movies can't recapture any of the horror magic that is Michael Myers for this movie.",1061769600,2,1948,4.505649717514125

The 2nd was shameful, the 3rd wasn't even Michael Myers and the others I haven't seen but only included one of the original cast members but probably ...anyway.
H20 was made in 1998, 20 years after the original (hence the subtitle ""20 YEARS LATER""). It is 1998 and Laurie Strode (the beautiful Jamie Lee Curtis) has changed her name and is now the headmistress at a private high school in California. She has been waiting for Michael Myers (NOT AUSTIN POWERS!) to come back for her, and he finally has and he's not only after her, he's after her son (Josh Hartnett in his first and worst role) and his girlfriend (Michelle Willaims of Dawson's Creek).

987069,3,6305171769,"Halloween H20 is a nice attempt to return to the core of the Michael Myers saga, but I think it comes up a little short in several ways.  First off, you have to forget that films three through six in the series ever happened, which is a pity given that I enjoyed those more than most fans seemed to.  Now, I am sure you remember Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Michaels sister whom he tried to kill on several occasions in the somewhat distant past, the one who survived only to be killed in a car accident a short while later.  Well, not only is she not dead, she has made two big mistakes in her new life as Keri Tate: she has had a son named John (Josh Hartnett) who has never seen a comb or hairbrush in his seventeen years of life, and she has developed some kind of relationship with a character played by Adam Arkin.  I do not know why I dislike Adam Arkin so much, but I was begging Michael to kill him from the first moment I saw him.  Anyway, Lori/Keri is now the headmistress of a supposedly highfalutin school in California, yet even after twenty years she is fighting her brothers demon, seeing his face over and over again every day.  Her son knows the whole story, but he is tired of being overprotected, telling his mother that Michael is dead and no longer a threat - despite the fact that they never found his body.  He is just a boy, but he should know better than to think Michael is out for the count.  A little break-in and bloody mayhem at the home of Dr. Loomis former nurse gives Michael all the information he needs to find his supposedly dead sister.  Since it is Halloween, Michael thinks it is only fitting to celebrate the anniversary of his old murder spree with his newly discovered family.  With only seven potential victims at the school (everyone else in the class having gone camping in Yosemite  why the school would organize a camping trip on Halloween is the biggest mystery of the whole movie), there is really not enough carnage to go around, but the movies opening walk down memory lane and a later reenactment of sorts by Lori of her trademark closet sanctuary escape plan help make up for some of the disappointment.  The most impactful moments of the film are the occasions when Lori and Michael come face to face for the first time in twenty years, although Alan Arkins little gun adventure qualifies as my favorite moment of the film by far.
Halloween H20 is a lot of fun in several ways.  The manner by which a supposedly-dead Michael keeps appearing, even after twenty years, to a haunted Lori in mirrors and reflections is presented very well.  I loved LL Cool Js character Ronny Jones, the school security guy and frustrated romance writer; he supplied many a laugh to help fill the void of no murders taking place for far too long.  Jamie Lee Curtis mother and Psycho shower victim Janet Leigh makes a fun cameo as Loris motherly secretary, and it was nice to see Dr. Loomis chain-smoking former nurse again.  I was especially gratified to hear a voiceover of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) in the opening credits.  For me, Dr. Loomis was as much a part of Halloween as Michael himself, and these films made since Pleasances death really lack the spark he always brought to the drama.  Speaking of no spark, though, I have to say I am not a fan of the new guy behind the mask.  Chris Durand does not seem to bring anything to his character.  I know that Michael is evil incarnate and pretty much dead inside, but he really just seemed to be going through the motions this time around.  Finding out that he had been tricked and that his sister was still alive after all these years should have infuriated him, but Michael looks bored throughout this whole movie.  There is one scene I especially hate; we look into Michaels eyes and see a reflection of a budding young victim; to me, Michaels eyes are supposed to be so black and empty that they will not reflect anything at all.  Sadly, Michael is just not himself this time around, and the fact that he continues to have so much trouble killing one frightened woman is really starting to make him look pretty weak in my eyes.
All in all, though, the film is well worth seeing, if for nothing else than for the special little treats that long-time horror fans will appreciate.  A more impressive actor behind the mask and a lot more bloody mayhem might possibly have made this movie something special, though.",1058832000,5,4412,4.479400749063671

It was like taking Jason out of Camp Crystal Lake. The movie almost seemed like an excuse to find roles for the up-and comer teens which where very hot at the moment. I also had a serious problem with the guy they cast as Michael Myers. Gimme a break! First of all, he was way to short, he walked like a duck, and YOU COULD SEE HIS BIG BLUE EYES!

(USA - 1998)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

Now living under an assumed identity as the principal of an exclusive private school in California, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is once again besieged on Halloween night by her murderous brother Michael, who appears to be targeting her grown-up son (Josh Hartnett).

Apparently instigated by Curtis herself in the run-up to the twentieth anniversary of the original HALLOWEEN (1978), and with uncredited script contributions by SCREAM writer Kevin Williamson, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER was promoted by Dimension Films as the 'final showdown' with boogey man Michael Myers (though its success at the box-office virtually guaranteed even further sequels). An ingenious script - credited to Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg - simply ignores the lackluster sequels which followed in the wake of HALLOWEEN II (1981) and makes a credible attempt to develop the characters beyond the usual stereotypical boundaries (plagued by nightmares which cause her to fear for Hartnett's safety, Curtis refuses to grant the boy his independence, leading to conflict and tragedy), all of which serves to underline the dramatic impact of Michael's subsequent rampage.

There are too many false scares during the first half of the film (one of which involves Curtis' real life mom Janet Leigh, cast here in a deliberate nod to her appearance in PSYCHO), and the influence of SCREAM and its imitators is evident in the hip dialogue and MTV-style editing, though Daryn Okada's widescreen lensing successfully replicates the look and feel of the first two 'Halloween' movies, and the relentless chase scenes which dominate the second half of the narrative are staged with genuine cinematic flair by director Steve Miner (previously responsible for entries 2 and 3 in the 'Friday the 13th' franchise).

Nancy Stephens reprises her role as a nurse from the original HALLOWEEN in a memorable pre-credits sequence, and Michelle Williams (TV's ""Dawson's Creek"") turns up in a supporting role alongside Adam Arkin (""Chicago Hope"") and LL Cool J (DEEP BLUE SEA), while Hartnett (PEARL HARBOR) makes an OK big screen debut as the focus of Michael's psychotic attentions. The film is dedicated to the memory of the late Donald Pleasence.

One of the key factors in the previous movies in the series was the fact that they were in Haddonfield...that was where Michael's rage began.....While the setting is still scary, a boarding school in Cali just doesn't give it the same spooky feel, and I just felt like I was watching an episode of Dawson's Creek (besides the fact that Michelle Williams was in the movie).....Also, the mask looks completely different, you're not supposed to be able to see his eyes, and the hair is all messed up....And the worst part, as a fan of the series, is that it completely ignores the story line from parts 4-6...just because the director doesn't like those films doesn't mean they don't exist.....
I'm completely for the empowered woman who finally faces her demons, or in this case her psycho killer brother, but as a fan of the series, this ranks right near the bottom of the heap....if you like the ""Halloween"" movies, get it just to say you have it, but in my opinion it's one of the worst in the series....",1052179200,5,1221,4.554545454545455

987077,4,6305171769,"It is rather amazing that the reputation of the original ""Halloween"" has not been tarnished by all the sequels that have come down the road in the last quarter century.  Whatever eloquence the first film had was replaced by as much explicit bloodletting as possible in ""Halloween 2"" and the fun has been continuing ever since.  ""Halloween: H20"" is an attempt, of sorts, to get the series back on track.  The idea is that the fourth, fifth and sixth films in the series never happened and we are now twenty years after the original bloodletting in the first two films.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back, all grown up with her own teenage son, only now she is running a private boarding school and calling herself Keri Tate.  This is not just because she is trying to escape the notoriety of being the sister of Michael Myers but also because she knows deep down inside that her brother is still out there somewhere trying to kill her.  Of course she is right; just do not ask what he has been doing for two decades, wandering around the country wearing that William Shatner mask painted white.
From a historical perspective ""Halloween"" was the first film where the slasher kept getting up every time he was put down.  Hard to believe that once upon a time this was a ""new"" idea, because certainly it has been done to death (pardon the phrase).  We are actually at the point where we are surprised in a film where the killer is killed and is actually dead.  The killer who cannot die has become such a commonplace it has gone well beyond the slasher genre.  What this means is that by the time we get to this film there is nothing new regarding his ability to survive knife slashes, blows from an ax, a rock being pounded on his skull, and other substantive physical assaults.  We have seen it all before and whether the slasher's name is Michael Myers, Jason, or whatever, it does not matter anymore.
That means the success of this film has a lot more to Laurie's end of the story than Michael's, and in that is the regard in which this film falls short.  It is made clear that Laurie has been thinking about this day (okay, this night; he always comes out at night) for two decades.  Given that she is running a private school (and recalling her answer regarding fate in her English class back in 1978) we also know that this is a smart person.  Surely in all that time she has come up with hundreds of plans on how she will stop her brother from driving a big knife into her body.  I mean, come on, remember what Nancy was able to put together in one night for Freddy Krueger.  Laurie Strode cannot do better?  Sigh.  Jamie Leigh Curtis deserved a better script than this for coming back and lending her considerable cache to the series that made her the original Scream Queen.  Just go back and watch the original to remember what made this stuff work in the first place.

987136,4,6305171769,"There came a point in the Halloween series where it lost its ideas and just became a hack job of films. The first two movies were great, telling the story of Michael Myers first night of terror over a collective three hours. But after a third film which had nothing to do with Myers, the killer came back as a clone of Jason Vorhees, with none of the freshness of the original film. But then along came Halloween: H20, which disregarded all but the first two films and successfully reunited the killer and Jamie Lee Curtis.
The secret to its success is how it ignores the poor sequels and brings the story right back to its origins. Forcing Laurie (Curtis) to confront the terror that has plagued her over the 20 years since that Halloween night, the film pays ample homage to the first two films without feeling like a soulless retread. Instead, it focuses on how such a traumatic event can haunt a person so harshly, their life constantly teetering on the edge of despair. Yes Myers is back, but except for a murderous opening, the film spends its first half on Laurie, on her alcoholism and her relationship with her son, now the age she was on that fateful Halloween night. And when Myers does finally show up, were ready for him, because we know the characters well, we understand them and honestly want to root for them.
In addition to paying tribute to some memorable scenes of the original films, Halloween H20 also fits in a fantastic scene with Curtis real life mother Janet Leigh, of the original Psycho. If youd never seen that film, youd never realize what the scene represented. Its beautifully subtle, an absolute surprise for a slasher flick. And without spoiling the end, the film concludes the Myers story in a fitting way (if you ignore the dismal follow-up Halloween: Resurrection, which destroys the fantastic conclusion).
For fans of the original Halloween films, the ones that were actually good, Halloween H20 is a fantastic return to form. Consider it the real Halloween III, the final chapter in a great horror trilogy, and ignore all the others.",1045180800,,2072,4.710743801652892

Jamie Lee Curtis makes her return (the last time she was seen was Halloween 2) as Laurie who now has a son (Josh Hartnett) and is an alcoholic to boot.  When Michael comes calling we see the aggressive side of Laurie that we never got to see which is refreshing, and it is good to see her and Mike go at it, but the rest of the film is just standard modern day post-Scream teeniebopper unscary horror mixed with the stalk & slash routines of the 80's.  Veteran horror director Steve Miner (who helmed the second and third installemnts in the Friday the 13th series as well as House) gives Michael the most character he's had in years, but what is with Mike's mask?  I mean we can see his eyes as clear as day, when did that happen last?  The rest of the semi-well known cast includes Alan Arkin, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J, and Curtis' real life mom Janet Leigh in a cameo.

I actually went to the theatre to be subjected to this... this...  torture!  I'm sure everyone involved in the movie are horribly ashamed of themselves.  I'll sum it up like so:  It was not scary at all - I couldn't imagine a five year old being even slightly disturbed (wasn't this marketed as a horror movie?) It had a terrible plot.  The acting was pure drivel.  LL Cool J miraculously survives - why???  It seems as though the dialogue was written by a 10 year old boy who has led a sheltered life.  Boring.  The movie was a long bore fest that continually disappointed scene after scene.  I am appalled that there are people who actually gave this movie a high rating.

Although part 6 was almost better in a ""scary"" sense, it had 2 undoubtful flaws. It was too gory and people were killed off too quick. Plus, Michael wasn't as ""fun"" as he was in the previouse films. The good things that part 6 owns that 7 doesn't is great, long suspense before the big chasing. I think when Kara's son walked into the Myers House and she ran across to the house to save him, that was so scary, and upstairs you can see Michael, stabbing Beth...But H20 has it's betters, like such great acting, including Curtis and Josh Harnett. The gore and bodycount was toned down from part 6's 15 deaths to H2O'S 6 deaths (2 off screen, so 4). H2o definately has a better ending then the previous, it is, however, too short (86 min.) but it was pretty well crammed for it's run time. This is definately a powerful sequel and fans should diss 3, 4, 5 and 6...and just keep 1, 2, H2O and Ressurection in their collection, it will make more sense, seeing that part 7 (h20) and 8 ignore parts 3-6 as if they never were released.

Cool, huh?  And superbit dvd's can be played on ANY dvd player:  that's right, they are multi-regional.  Who'd thunk that?  You won't have to buy those silly multi-regional adaptors for your dvd player or your playstation either (RegionX), and you won't need to go out and buy a Superbit Dvd Player to enjoy them.

My beef here isn't that those were good or bad sequels (reading here clearly indicates alot of people dissatisfied with 4,5,6)  but that the events were not even worth noting.  Conceded.....the real Halloween storyline is LAURIE vs. MICHAEL MYERS however.....in 4,5 and 6 who was the ""boogeyman""?  It was Michael Myers.  In 4,5 and 6 where did it take place?  It was HADDONFIELD (not Santa Mira!).  What is one ""small thing"" that 1,2,4,5,6 have in common?  DONALD PLEASANCE!--no reference to him in H20 was there?  Remember in JAWS 2 they mentioned Matt Hooper (r. dryefuss)when the new Shark appeared in Amity?.....(Pleasance was as much the spirit (if not more) of those films as JLC was in the first 2 - funny we get a PSYCHO references but none of him).  Jamie Lloyd was who?  Oh my gosh...Laurie Strode's daughter...and was not mentioned.  I thought the Thorn cult idea was eerie and mysterious and could have been persued in any sequel after H6.  If the ideas behind the film were to distance itself from 4,5,6 because of negative feedback on those films at least they could have threaded the storyline from those along into H20 if at least in reference.

987210,4,6305171769,"Once upon a time, way back in 1978, there was a little independent film released at the wrong time of year for its title:  Halloween.  Halloween was not only the first of its kind (in a very long time), but it provided its horrors elegantly and suspensefully, not grotesquely and blatantly.  It was the first film from director John Carpenter (waaaaaay before he insisted that his name go above the titles of his increasingly bad movies).  Halloween's popularity inspired not only imitations galore (Friday the 13th, The Burning, etc.), but its own sequels.  The first sequel (Halloween II) continued the horrors set up in the original on the same evening of the original (but this time full of gore), employing the newly crowned queen of scream, Jamie Lee Curtis, as the star just off her turn in the original.  This was a coup that made the sequel a huge hit too.  Then the misery began....
Someone in Hollywood got the bright idea to change the Halloween films into a brand name.  Thus was born Halloween III:  Season of the Witch.  This film had absolutely nothing to do with the first two films and it also had absolutely nothing to do with horror or scares (unless you count the horror of paying to watch such dreck).
Halloween IV through VI were sequels to the first two Halloweens, but their premise and association was only remotely attached (Halloween V was a decent delivery, but only when seen as a stand alone film).
Halloween H2O was a return to the original franchise.  All the press that came out on the film told viewers that this film is the real sequel to Halloween II.  In other words, it is the real Halloween III.  This was a wise move.  Not only do we have a return to the original story basis, but we are given a return of the original Halloween heroine - Jamie Lee Curtis (no longer a newbie, but a seasoned and accomplished actress, who has the Halloween films to thank, in part, for her success).
It is 20 years later (thus the 20, part of the title - the H refers to Halloween - get it? - Halloween 20 years later).  Laurie Strode is alive and disturbed after the horrors of that night some twenty years earlier.  She is a mental basket case, a functioning alcoholic, single mother to Josh Hartnett, and the head mistress of a toney boarding school in the middle of nowhere California.  Having faked her death many years earlier to avoid the infamy of the horrors of that long ago night (and to hide from her brother Michael, whom she still believes to be alive), she lives as much of a normal life as she can.  Only her son and she knows who she really is.
Of course, Michael is no more dead, than the Pope is Jewish.
Halloween H20 does some really neat things that make this film seem not only like a real sequel, but a welcomed return by an old friend.  For example, the opening scene features a nurse returning home from work - the nurse seems oddly familiar - and rightly so - if you remember waaay back, it is the same nurse who accompanied Donald Pleasance to the insane asylum the night that Michael Myers originally escaped in 1978.  The same actress is used.  I don't think she's ever done another film between these two films, but darned if I didn't like that continuity!
Also, Jamie Lee's secretary at the school is none other than her very own ""real life"" mother:  Janet Leigh.  This is a really cool cameo, because it offers us a nod to the Hollywood legacy that Jamie Lee inherited, but it also ties in the horror connection as well - Janet was the first to die in the Great Grandfather of all slasher films:  Psycho!  Now, the filmmakers decided to go even one better, which is the most delicious part of all to the cameo.  The car the secretary drives is the exact - and I do mean exact same car that Janet Leigh drove in Psycho.  Plus - Plus - if you listen carefully, you will hear the music change very briefly to the Bernard Hermann score from Psycho.  It is a very cool cameo!!
Halloween H20 is really a fine sequel and is deserving of being the real Halloween III.  No longer just a weakling girl who runs from Michael, Laurie stands up to him and shows her mettle.  This is not only within character, but necessary in light of the female empowerment movies that would not allow her to do otherwise (Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, anyone?).
Rent this film, because it is not only a good fright film, but it is an worthy descendent of the original film.",1034553600,14,4400,4.450124688279302

Halloween, Halloween 2, Halloween H2O, Haloween 4, Halloween 6, Halloween 5, Halloween 3.
Halloween and Halloween 2 are far and away my favourite films in the series, with H2O easily third in line.  I just watched it for the 5th time - quite scary at times, some great parts, like Michael appearing under the dumbwaiter shaft brandishing his carving knife, the cry of pain when Josh Hartnett is stabbed in the leg, the sheer look of terror by Jamie Lee Curtis as she comes face-to-face with Michael separated only by a door.  Nice cameo by Janet Leigh, too.  I liked how Michael Myers almost exclusively used a carving knife.  I liked the start, when the clock ticked over to October 31st, the flashback to Halloween, etc.  I didn't like how (the late) Donald Pleasence's brief voiceover was redone by another actor, and I love L.L. Cool J as a rapper, esp. his early albums - not as a wise ass security guard.  If you haven't seen any Halloween movies, try renting 1,2 then H2O.",1033603200,,1098,4.571428571428571
987212,4,6305171769,"When I heard things about this film, I was thinking of water because of ""H20"" or a title of a Hall & Oates album.  I just thought a Halloween 7 would be just as lame as the previous four sequels.  Not knowing what to expect, I was DEAD wrong.
This film marks the landmark return of Jamie Lee Curtis (who hates horror movies), then newcomer Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams (Dawsons Creek), Nancy Stephens (who was in Halloween 1 & 2), hip-hopper LL Cool J and a special appearance by Janet Leigh - Jamie Lee's, the scream queen's mother !!!
This film originally was to be written and directed by John Carpenter who declined due to other film commitments is written by Kevin Williamson (Scream) and directed by Steve Miner who what ?? directed Friday the 13th Part 2 & 3 !!  The film score is by a newcomer John Ottman with influental original music by John Carpenter.
This film, which totally disregards Halloween 3, 4, 5 & 6, which I thought was a smart move by the writer takes place 20 years after Halloween 1 & 2.  Our masked friend Mikey Myers stops off at Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) house then tracks down his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) - a woman named Keri Tate who now has a 17 year old son, John (Josh Hartnett) and is the Head Dean of a private school in Northern California.  She has been in hiding and on the run from her killer brother for the past twenty years.  Laurie Strode is a force to be reckoned in this film.  My favourite moments are (1) when Norma (Janet Leigh) drives away in her car, which happens to be the same car she driven in the classic Psycho (bonus) and the very end and I think most know what I am talking about.
I thought this film did justice for the series because it disregarded all the crappy past sequels, it concentrated on Jamie Lee and Micheal and that Micheal gets it with one clean shot ... which leave it to another bunch of writers would lead to HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION, which I will review when the DVD is released.
This film is presented in widescreen (2.35:1) version with Digital 5.1 Surround which is fine for the film.  There was a misprint of ""Special Feautures"" as no commentary was included.  A Trivia Game was included and a Creed music video and I think that is about it.
I highly recommend this film to all who are Halloween fans, accompanied with Halloween 1 & 2, which I do have in my DVD  collection.

Why would Laurie Strode fake her death and leave behind her little daughter as prey for her crazy brother?  Kinda selfish, to say the least.  Then I understood what ""20 years later"" implied.  When watching this movie, you have to pretend that everything after the sequel doesn't exist.
Laurie Strode is living somewhere else now with her teen son.  She assumes that her dear brother Michael has no idea where she is.  Fool!  Michael knows everything.

987317,4,6305171769,"Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't even know she had a brother, until he tried to kill her on Halloween night of 1978.  She knew about psychotic killer Michael Myers, of course, as did everyone in her neighborhood of Haddonfield, Illinois, who killed his older sister when he was only six years old and was incarcerated in the state loony bin, but she didn't know she was related to Michael because she was relocated and given a name change after the brutal crime.  Laurie was seventeen when Michael escaped and tried to kill her off, the sole surviving member of his original family.  He didn't succeed, but he did massacre a number of her friends and assorted others who got in his way.  Michael was presumed dead after that night of mass murder, but his body was never found.
Laurie faked her death and changed her name again, this time to Keri Tate, and became the headmistress of a posh private prep school.  The years have not been kind to her.  At age thirty-seven, her husband has divorced her, and her seventeen year old son John (Josh Hartnett) finds her overprotectively paranoid.  She's an alcoholic, to boot.  She's always been certain Michael will return one day to finish off old business, and with his obsession about murdering all his kin, John will be next in line after her.
Just as she's beginning to learn to trust again with new beau Adam Arkin, and starting to lighten-up on watching over her son, her worst fear becomes a reality.  Michael has found out her new identity, and tracked her down.  And, needless to say, the intervening years have done nothing to improve his disposition...
This is a great script, well-acted and -directed and handsomely produced.  It has more tension than any entry in the series, except for the first.  The action is plenty nasty.  There are a number of terrific camera shots, the best being of Laurie and Michael's first face-to-face confrontation through a porthole-style window.  The music score is excellent, making marvellous use of the famous original John Carpenter/Alan Howarth theme and adding new dimensions to it, though that actual theme is oddly underused during the gripping finale.  The opening credit sequence and music is phenomenally good, panning and cross-dissolving over headline clippings of Michael's previous reign of terror and Laurie's sad history, while an actor doing a near-perfect impersonation of the late Donald Pleasance (Michael's doctor, from the preceding entries) narrates highlights of the same.  The ending of the movie is especially surprising and satisfying.
The best thing about this film, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' mature performance of a woman barely coping with the lasting scars of deep trauma, which is credibly and sensitively handled.
Unfortunately, another sequel (Halloween: Resurrection) followed this perfect conclusion to the popular series, though that doesn't diminish H20's stature.  Even those who've never seen any of the other entries will enjoy it, on its own merits.",1026777600,,2992,5.048780487804878

987320,3,6305171769,"There are two ways you can view Halloween H20. Number One: Forget that Halloween 4-6 were ever made, and believe that Halloween 1-2 are the only existing ones. This would make for an enjoyable horror movie. At times, H20 has a bit of the same feel of the original and its sequel, but an updated feel to it. Michael is a bit more brutal here, but it was the 90's and the Scream phase was going on. Jamie Lee Curtis is as strong as ever as Laurie Strode, and plays off her ""near the brink of insanity"" persona very well. The final showdown -- er -- showdown between her and Michael in the school is a very tense and good setup. The acting from the supporting characters is very acceptable. Especially that of Josh Hartnett.
 Now, let's see it from my second viewpoint. In Halloweens 4-6, Laurie Strode supposedly had another child. Jamie Strode, and it was these 3 films that focused on Michael trying to kill her. He finally managed to do so in part 6, but not before she also had a child. And what about the whole Thorn occult deal that Michael is linked to? This is what upsets me about the Halloween series in general, it didn't keep up with its continuity. And with Halloween Resurrection's release, they even space themselves more with discontinuity by completely ignoring Laurie's son, John (Josh Hartnett). Read my Halloween Resurrection review for more on what I have to say.
 When I do watch H20 (And I do occasionally because it's entertaining), I try to set my movie-mind with the fact that there is no Halloween 4-6, and that this is only the third entry in the series. I at least enjoy it better when I think that.",1026345600,3,1626,4.4713804713804715

The now have a field trip, but the four friends are thinking to stay at schooll and celebrate Halloween.
But things get scary when Michael Myers, who was not dead, starts to stalk John, and Laurie gets [angry].
I'm not really a Halloween fan, but it was good to see Michael back in action.
Not too many kills, but really good ones. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance, remembering the old Halloween.
Fans were very happy to see her again.
I was hoping to see a bigger part for LL Cool J, but he was great. Very funny and original, specially the phone conversations with his wife.
Laurie's lover was a flaw, he ruins Jamie Lee's part. Michelle Williams(Very different from Jenny, her Dawson's creek rol) it's a little chubby, but still loking good.
Josh Hartnett, good as usual. But it should had a better part.
Director Steve Miner(From House, Friday the 13 part 2 and 3 and Lake Placid) gives and excellent direction, including good blood efects, shadows, and a hole new mask for Michael.
'Cause they used the old mask, but they changed it for a better one, that looks real nice.
He also does a lot of homages. Including Psicho, Scream 2('ll Told you about that later), and the same original Halloween).
Scream 2, in Mollys room you can see that the girls are watching it, the part were Sarah Michelle Gellar gets killed.
Halloween H20, 20 years later it's a simple but effective film, about Michael getting more and more angry, so if you want more wait for part 8.
I know a few things of it, and I don't want to ruin it, but I know that Jamie Lee Curtis gets killed in the firts 10 minutes.
Becuase Michael is not dead, and he's coming back home, to revenge from the kids who had taken his house.
Can't wait to see it, it seems that it's going to be a blast.

987322,4,6305171769,"I believe that any real fan of the Halloween series would agree that this one is the best since the start. There are so many little nuances in it that are similar to the original that you can tell that the producers & Jamie Lee Curtis put some real thought and time into making it better than Parts 4, 5, & 6. The fact that this film doesn't make reference to those three movies worked for me. Any real fan knows that the core story is about Michael and Laurie and everything else is just filler. They can add all the new characters and killings they want but without Laurie or ""family"" for Michael to obsess over none of it makes any sense.

This version is true to the original in that Laurie is naturally still shell shocked and scared after all these years and Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job and obviously has fun in the part that made her a star so many years ago. Not all of the characters are necessary, which happens a lot. I think L.L. Cool J was fine but Adam Arkin was wasted here.

My pans for this film are: It could have been a tad longer, especially the BIG fight scene, which the audience had waited 20 years for. It should have been much longer and tougher on both characters...we deserved it!

I loved all the little references to the original film(s); Laurie bumps into everyone, Mr. Sandman playing twice and Laurie getting sliced on the same arm AGAIN ..OUCH, that ain't ever gonna heal!! Also loved the fun they have with Jamie Lee's mom Janet Leigh and poking fun at Psycho..Her name is Norma (Norman Bates) and she drives the exact car she did in Psycho, cute! I for one would have LOVED a cameo by the actresses who played Linda and Annie in the first film. She kept seeing Michael everywhere she looked, so why not her dead best friends occassionaly, that would have been fun for the audience I think.

Oh well, you can't have everything. I do highly recommend this film if you enjoy this series, though as a fan you only need to own the original Halloween, Part 2, and H20 and you'll have the whole picture....buy and enjoy! Peace. :o)",1025913600,,2065,4.355844155844156

I really liked how they brought back the nurse Mary Wittingham.  That was a nice touch.  I also liked the homage paid to Phsyco with Janet Leigh.

987324,4,6305171769,"As Chucky (& his love) finally revived his power with the third sequel, so this famous John Carpenter classic film got a modest, well-deserved treatment with this fairly good installment.  And looking back from now, it is a miracle that stars like Josh Hartnett (""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Black Hawk Down"") and Michelle Williams (""Dick"") have been brought in here (Well, but once Renee Zelweger was in a 1995 sequel of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacare"" so ... remember that?).  Well, this is what we call muscle of now influential studios Miramax and Dimention Films.
The story is very simple.  Just forget the other sequels, and consider yourself transported to 20 years later.  Now Mike Meyers's sister (Jamie Lee Curtis returning to her ""Screaming Queen"" role with very apt opening entrance with her BIG scream), still afraid of the terrible events years ago, is found in a posh private high school, where she is now principle.  She is living with her son (Hartnett), who thinks, quite understandably, his mother is over-protective.  But why, he does not know Mike brandishing a knife, and this Mike is supposed to be burnt to death ... until now.
With a well-crafted, complicated opening scenes which show  clearly the touch of acclaimed writer Kevin Williamson (co-producer here), ""Halloween H20"" starts promisingly, gradually setting the background of each possible victims.  The film, though never overcoming the handicaps of being a sequel, which naturally has to preserve the rules the original made, fares pretty well, always keeping a good pace.  Steve Miner (known with Lake Placid"" and many others) knows how to engage our interests even though not his skills are not on par with that of Wes Craven, whose ""Scream"" series have something in common with this film: funny in-jokes about horror film genre, and a bit predictable, but still well-executed set-pieces.
Probably, those who have seen the original ""Holloween"" and many other older films (like ""Psycho"") can get more joy from this sequel.  If you haven't seen them, I suggest strongly see them before watching this.  You may miss many things, without which, you can still enjoy yourself, though, and the ending of the film (which reminds us of that of another famous horror film) is not a little surprsing, considering the fact that this franchize is still going on.  But OK, forget it.
The best thing of this film is, in my book, the welcome re-entrance of Jamie Lee Curtis (whose mother Janet Leigh, in ... what else, ""Psycho,"" can be seen as a cameo).  LL Cool J also appears as a guard.
Overall, satisfactory, if not perfect, this is a unexpected revival of the series that seem once dead already.  My verdict about the work per se is actually 3 stars, but with its good, tongue-in-cheek reference to the genre, one star up.",1022803200,,2784,4.9336188436830835

987374,4,6305171769,"Halloween's Michael Myers  was the first, and possibly, the best of the masked serial
killers which proliferated after it's success. Imitators included notoriety Friday the
13's Jason. The Halloween franchise seemed to have exhausted itself after the dire
Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995), but one of the rules of  the slasher
movies is that the killer is never really dead and can be revived. After the success of
Scream (1996) and films like it the time seemed right to bring Michael Myers back.
Also it was the twentieth anniversary of the first. Also this film had both money
thrown at it. The previous six films had grossed over $200 million for a budget of $20
million and some of those were truly dire (step forward parts three and six). This film
has similar feel to Halloween (1978) in that the director crafted this film with love
and Michael skulks around in the shadows in mark contrast to the high power lighting
in Halloween II (1981). The murders in this movie however do owe more to such
films as Friday the 13th (1980) and Halloween II (1981) instead of the first with there
being lashes of blood and one scene which made everyone in the cinema which I was
in wince.
 The nurse in part one and two Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) comes home to
find that her home has been broken in to and the file on Laurie Strode (the victim in
parts one and two) has been taken. The burglar turns out to Michael Myers (Chris
Durand) who is back to his old ways. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) after the
events of Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981) has changed her name (to Keri
Tate) and is a border line alcoholic. She has a son John (Josh Harnett), but there is
conflict between them over her fears over Michael Myers. The plot (which these
movies are notoriety thin) has the majority of the pupils at the bordering school go
camping apart from Josh, his girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams), her friend Sarah
(Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and her boyfriend Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd). They stay behind
to indulge in the kind of halloween fun which always seem to rile marauding
psychopaths who populate this movies. It can safely (fingers crossed) that this will be
the last one in the series. The reason being the ending although this is no guarantee.
For an example of that look no further than Friday the 13th The Final Chapter (1984)
which was promptly followed by five more sequels!
 Steve Miner (who directed Friday the 13th part two and Friday the 13th part three in
1982 and 1983 respectively) has more of a feel for these type of movies than others in
the series and it works. It has it's fair share of scares and is a more worthy sequel than
others in the series. The writers has wisely jettisoned parts three to six and have
concentrated on the ones starring Jamie Lee Curtis. The music is also noteworthy.
The only gripe with the movie is that it lacks Donald Pleasance, but since he died three years before it was a bit hard even for horror movies which are notorious for bringing the dead back to live. The idea to have Donald Pleasance's voice over the credits at the beginning is a good one. It establishes a link with the first two and wisely by-passes parts 4 to six. It has the references which all films post-Scream (1996) have to have with an example of this being the theme song Mr Sandman from Halloween II (1981) making appearances periodically normally on the radio. It is Halloween updated for the post-Scream Dawson Creek generation and is all the better

Apparently I'm oblivious, because in reading another review I just discovered that the ' Bonus Commentary ' advertised on the back cover of my DVD is nonexistent! I just sat down a few minutes ago to watch this movie again ( which I purchased used almost a year ago ), this time with the running commentary, and damned if I couldn't locate it. There is a mistake on the older DVD's apparently that advertises a commentary track that doesn't exist. Shame on you, Dimension Films! Oh well, guess I shouldn't believe everything I read. As for the movie itself..not bad. If you are new to the Halloween franchise, let me recommend that you watch a triple feature, Halloween, Halloween 2 ( takes place the same nite..like one long movie ) and Halloween H2O, which takes place 20 years after that nite. Halloween 3-6 really have nothing to do with the ' trilogy ' , and in the case of #3, have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Michael Myers story. Avoid #6 at all costs..it's an absolutely abysmal movie, which brings up the subject of the new #8 film starring Busta Rhymes that has yet to be released, which has all the writings of a quick-cash travesty on it, but I digress. Halloween H20 is a short film, under 90 minutes, and upon first viewing, it felt TOO short..but now I think it's just right. Michael Myers is back to finish off his sister, but she has something else in mind. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers an excellent performance in this movie, her best in my opinion. Critics may dismiss her performance, because let's face it, this is the seventh Halloween movie, we aren't talking about Citizen Kane here. I urge you to watch this movie once for the fun of it, and then again for her performance..Curtis is in such command of her performance, shows such strength, that it all but screams "" This franchise is nothing without me, I OWN this movie "". Great work by her, which will be tarnished somewhat by the next movie, in which rumor has it, she is killed off early on. What a shame, because they could have ended the story with H20. This is not Star Wars here, but in the realm of horror, Halloween is legendary, and it felt right to end it after the last movie. Oh well, money rules the world. So anyways, if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't watch it without seeing the first 2 in the series, because it will mean much more to you than if you saw it on it's own.

She played her character so well, you could just feel her emotions and how scared she really was that Michael might return to get her.  I think that this film was very well done because it had a pretty flat story that was able to translate quite well.  But, there are quite a lot of noticable, and annoying, flaws.  First off, why, oh, WHY did the makers decide that we shold be able to see Myer's eyes?  Why???!!!  It ruins what was so, so scary about him in the original.  And, simply put, the guy who plays him (...).  In his interveiw (which you can see on HalloweenMovies.com) he said he didn't watch any of the others to see how he should play the part.  Well, if every other actor that played Michael studied the origial, this guy should have too.  He looks like a human.  I hate it.  I can't stand it.  How hard is it to make a mask that looks like the one in the original, huh?  This Michael is like Ghoastface (Scream) in a different costume.  He jerks his head around, walks fast, and he's not even scary, just dumb looking.  And when Jamie Lee kicks him in between the legs, his eyes get all big.  I think this guy  who's been shot like a million times, and stabbed, blown up, caught on fire, all that... well I don't think he'd care if you kicked him.  This Michael doesn't have that ghost quality that all the others had.  So, he really, really, sucked big time as Michael.  There are also strange mistakes.  Like, Marion Whittington?  Did she get married or something, because in Halloween 2 she clearly states ""This is Marion Chambers with Dr. Loomis at the clinic.""  That was strange, and I noticed that the first time.  If she didn't get married, this is just one of the silliest and ridiculous flaws in a movie.  Also, ignoring the events of all the films after Part 2?  I say, if you start something, finish it.  It's like all the films from 4-6 weren't good enough, like a bad book.  I found the concept of Michael in a cult called Thorn extremely interesting, and was eager to watch this one after I finished the sixth one.  I was hoping for a continuation of Part 6.  But, there's no mention of Jamie, Jamie's baby, Kara, Danny, Tommy Doyle, or many others.  And of course, to bring Jamie Lee back they have to make the lame excuse ""She faked her death in the car crash"".  For god's sake, since 1988, people have been beleving she was dead, died in a car crash.  And this silly excuse is just way to sloppy.  There's lots of other stupid mistakes, the movie does have it high points as well.  Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a great, great performance, Adam Arkin's good, LL Cool J is really funny, and the cameo by Janet Leigh is sweet (and it's so cool how that car from Psycho pops up in the one scene, pure genious).  However, an annoyance is the horrible score.  They simply use music from ""Scream"" and hope we won't notice.  Well, I noticed.  There's nothing wrong with the Scream music.  It's a terrific score, but it belongs in Scream, not in Halloween.  Also, the music is just to much.  They've taken John Carpenter's terrifc score and turned it rotten.  It's like a whole, big orchestra playing the theme now, and not the scary, simple theme sone of the original.  But, I loved the little clip of the two girls watching Scream 2 (as in Scream 1, they watch Halloween).  And the amusing referance where John's (Josh Hartnett) freind, Charlie (Adam Hynn' Byrd) sais that in twnty years John will still be living with his mother, propably running some weird motel out in the middle of nowhere (and people thought the original had a lot of Psycho references).
The plot has Michael dispatching of Marion ""Whittington"" near the beggining, as well as two annoying teens (one, for a second, dressed in a hockey mask, as the director directed Friday The 13ths 2 and 3) and stealing the file for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  He finds out that she's up at a secluded private school, and so he heads out.  It just so happens to be Halloween's eve (what a surprise).  He heads to the school, where most of the kids, and staff, are on a feildtrip.  He makes his way past the security guard, Ronnie (LL Cool J)  and enters to go find Laurie, his sister.
H20 doesn't feature any scares or suspense whatsover, but it's an overall well crafted sequal.  Laurie's alchoholism, is a nice addition, it doesn't stick out and scream ""Laurie's an alcoholic"", like some movies do.  And I feel Josh Hartnett played John very well.
The DVD doesn't deserve the title Collector's Edition.  Most of the things Amazon listed as special features (Production Notes, Theatrical Trailers) aren't there.  Also, the cover says there's an audio commentary by Director Steve Miner, and Jamie Lee Curtis, but there isn't.  At first I thought it might be hidden, but I don't think Dimension does that.  There is only a short 15 minute documentary (which is more about the original than this one) and a music video, as well as a super duper easy trivia game.  The movie is presented in proper 2:35:1 widescreen letterbox format, and it's got good picture and sound, as well as english subtitles, and scene selsction.  I'd say if you don't already have the movie, just get the DVD for the correct format (widescreen), but if you've got the video, stick with it.  I dought if there's gonna be another version, because this is marked as a collector's edition.

987424,4,6305171769,"First off, H20 is probably the third best in the series, next to the first two of course.  The movie is filled with tension, genuine scares, and a fine cast.  Like I said in the title, director Steve Miner forgets the moronic plots of parts 3-6 (the cults, Thorn God etc.) and instead concentrates on Michael and Laurie.

Michael is the same, undying psycho we knew and loved the original, and Jamie Lee Curtis is still a compelling heroine. Michael has always been the most effective boogeyman in horror history, and he lives up to the title here. He induces goosebumps in several scenes, such as the cafeteria, when he starts flipping tables, to the kitchen and the garbage disposal.  I don't want to give too much away, but the Halloween series hasn't had this many memorable moments since part 2.

My only gripe about this movie really has nothing to do with the movie itself.  H20 would have had more impact and suspense if it didn't have so many doofy sequels preceding it. If it had only been the first two and then H20, it would have made Michael's return so much more exciting.

987454,4,6305171769,"Nothing can come close to outdoing John Carpenter's Halloween, and H20 doesn't come close. Still, it is one hell of a ""Halloween"" film. This is the one that everyone has been waiting for. Michael Myers discovers sister Laurie Strode has faked her death, changed her name, and is now the Head Mistress of a private school in Southern California. Her 17 year old son John also lives with her there. Michael decides for a holiday family reunion. Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal. No longer is she young, innocent Laurie Strode. She is now a much more stronger person who wants to end her demons once and for all. Some fans weren't as pleased with this colder, harder Laurie. I was for it all the way. I mean, it's been 20 years. She went thru a lot and has lived with it. People change. Things will change them. She couldn't be the same Laurie we all know and love. I thought it was a great character dynamic. Jamie Lee blows her previous two performances to hell with this one, as well as pretty much every other scream queen performance. The remaining cast:Adam Arkin, Michelle Williams, LL Cool J, Janet Leigh, really have nothing to do. That's a horrible shame. Halloween gets an A list cast but doesn't take advantage of it. Arkin is exceptionally likeable and watchable. He should've been given a lot more to do. The film could've done without all the ""fake scares"", but it is still a suspenseful film. Nurse Marion being back was a nice touch, as was the use of a Loomis photo and the old ""Mister Sandman"" song from Halloween II. The ending was very strong and effective. Michael reaching for Laurie's hand was, dare I say it?, touching. It was a truly superb and extraordinary end for the movie and the series. There has never been a Laurie/Michael moment like that before in the series. It was a very strong scene that will no doubt be a pivotal moment in the series. Many people whined because it ignored previous storylines. That was a good thing. The previous storyline was so hampered down by inane junk that it was the problem the series started to really stink. Ignoring it was a good thing to do. It turned the series into something else. Something it doesn't, and shouldn't, need to be. I do wish, however, that the events of Part 4 were looked back on. I don't like the ignoring of the 'Jamie' character. It would of been nice to of mentioned her. This is the first film without Dr. Loomis. It is a sad thing to think about. He WAS the star of these movies. He made them. His presence was definitley missed. How nice it would of been for him and Laurie to be together in this. Chris Durand is an adequate Michael. The mask was pretty good, and he had the walk down. He was a little too thin and puney tho. The score, by John Ottman, is nice. It sounds good, but he mixes with the theme and eases the tension off of it. It sounded good, but was not right. All in all, they tried hard to return Michael to his old self. They succeeded. There wasn't much blood or any kind of gore(like the original), and the body count was down from previous installments. It was time they turned Michael back into 'Michael' instead of turning him into a ridiculous, over the top slasher like Jason. Why so many fans hated this is beyond me. All I know is that this is the first sequel since the original that was made like it was done with love and respect for the series and it's fans. The series will, and has, go on. What H20 tried to do will of been for nothing at all. That's a shame. They did such a good job. Let's hope future sequels, if there are any, will try as hard as the makers of this one to make a Halloween film that looks and feels like a Halloween movie, and that it is done with the same kind of love and admiration as this one. Nothing is going to be as good as the first one. People going in to see a new sequel should not even begin to think that. H20 is a great treat for fans.

987456,4,6305171769,"The ""Halloween"" saga has always been a favorite of horror film fans.  It began with a ground-breaking, terrifying original, and moved onto ""Halloween II"" which continued the story on the same night as the original, making it the perfect companion piece.  While not as relentlessly terrifying as the original, it is a scary movie.
Then came ""Halloween 3"" which had nothing to do with the rest of the series.  It could have been an all right movie if they had left off the ""Halloween"" title.  But it raised so many fan expectations that it fell very short.
""Halloween 4"" brought Michael Myers back, and returned to the suspense of the first two films, heralding the 10-year-old original.  ""Halloween 5"" was a step down in quality, with a good first 20 minutes, and suspenseful second half to make up for the ""stupid teenagers and sex"" sub-plot.  ""Halloween 6"" was on the same level as the fifth one--entertaining in parts, but it was so choppy, you could hardly tell what was going on a lot of the time.
Then it came full-circle.  20 years after the original film came ""Halloween: H20--Twenty Years Later"", bringing everybody's favorite horror heroine, Laurie Strode--played by Jamie Lee Curtis--back to the screen.  It bypasses films 3-6, and becomes a direct sequel to the first two.  It is an excellent film, very scary and suspenseful, while not falling too much into the trappings of ""Scream"" rip-offs.  With Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers going face-to-face 20 years later, it brings a successful resolution to the saga.
""Halloween: The Homecoming"" is supposed to be coming out soon, and I'll probably see it, just because it too has JLC and Michael Myers.  But I have a feeling that it is going to be about as good as ""Halloweens 3, 5, and 6"", which is not very good.  ""Homecoming"" will negate the whole effect of H20's brilliant climax in which Michael finally meets with his death, and I think it should stay unreleased.  If you want to experience the true story of Halloween, watch ""Halloween"", ""Halloween II"", and ""Halloween H20"".  This trilogy of Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis is super-scary and brings the terrifying story to a satisfying resolution.
It begins 20 years after the first two films, and Nurse Marion from the first two finds her house broken into, with files on Laurie Strode missing, before Michael Myers kills her.  Then Michael heads out to California, where Laurie is living under a different name, with her teenage son John, and running a prep school.  But as Halloween draws closer, Laurie must finally face her demons, and goes head-to-head with her masked brother for a final showdown that has an unexpected, yet completely satisfying conclusion--bringing the story of Michael and Laurie to a close. The acting is excellent for a horror film, and it is a beautifully made film.  The music, which hints at John Carpenter's original themes, is very creepy.  The direction is quite good as well.  It is certainly the best of the ""Halloween"" sequels, follwed closely by ""II"".
The DVD is an awesome widescreen version.  But there is no commentary as mentioned on the box, and no theatrical trailers.  But there is a neat documentary on the making of the film.  And the picture and sound quality is excellent.  Buy H20 now, before it's too late! You won't regret it.  Now you can see how the horror saga really ends.",995241600,17,3352,4.80977312390925
987475,3,6305171769,"The twentieth-year anniversary of John Carpenter's seminal slasher opus, ""Halloween,"" finds original star Jamie Lee Curtis once again facing off against her arch-nemesis: Michael Myers. Set exactly twenty years following the events of ""Halloween II,"" ""Halloween H20"" ignores the three installments preceding it. That means no Jamie Lloyd, no wacky cult subplot and no mysterious man in black.

In this reboot of sorts, Laurie Strode has faked her own death, fleeing to California where she works as a private school teacher. Wrestling with her demons, she struggles with blatant alcoholism while trying to raise her resentful teenage son, John (Josh Hartnett). Things eventually come to a head when Michael plans a family reunion of sorts and follows her cross-country, engaging her in one last (?) game of cat and mouse.

While ""Halloween H20"" tries its hardest to restore order to a franchise that had gotten more and more convoluted with each subsequent installment, it can't help but succumb to some problems of its own. Capitalizing on the teen-slasher boom of the late 90's, the seventh film in the long-standing franchise opts to pay tribute to Wes Craven's ""Scream"" in more ways than one. From its cheeky self-referential script penned by ""Scream"" writer Kevin Williamson, to its recycled score by Marco Beltrami and its casting of hip and hot WB stars, this film reeks of late 90's teen slasher. While ""Scream"" itself paid homage to the original ""Halloween"" in clever ways, the reverse treatment given by ""H20"" is not only premature but serves to date the film horribly as well.

It's not all bad news for the film, though. Jamie Lee Curtis is in top form here, portraying the on-the-edge version of Laurie Strode as naturally and believably as she did the sweet and innocent girl next door decades before. Her final showdown against Myers can only be summed up as epic and is the saving grace of the entire film. This final act is jam-packed with suspense and emotion, and it's all thanks to Curtis's fiery performance. Supporting roles from LL Cool J and Adam Arkin are adequate, while a young Josh Hartnett cuts his teeth on a potentially juicy but ultimately one-dimensional character.

Director Steve Miner made his bones in the 80's directing two ""Friday the 13th"" sequels as well as the semi-cult classic, ""House,"" so it should come as no surprise that he does an adequate job with his take on the Myers saga. While he's no John Carpenter, Miner does his best to bring the expected suspense and drama to the table, and even when it's obvious that the studio undercut him in more than a few ways (what's up with that CGI mask?) he still manages to provide significant class and closure to a floundering franchise.

In the end, ""Halloween H20"" is hardly a perfect film. It's arguably better than the two films before it, but hardly lives up the original film or even its sequel. Fans will rejoice in seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back to the genre and hellbent on revenge, especially in the film's final moments. Unfortunately, the rest is just so painfully average and sanitized that it renders itself ineffective as a companion-piece to John Carpenter's masterpiece and plays more as a sign of the times. What could have truly been a grand cinematic event for horror nuts is instead yet another teen slasher flick, albeit one that's a slight notch above the rest.",993772800,2,3373,4.900175131348512

Boyfriend Alan Arkin tries to understand Laurie/Keri, and things are made abundantly clear on Halloween night as brother Michael Myers comes calling once again. Myers isn't especially scary in this installment, and his heavy breathing is missing from the soundtrack. Nonetheless, it will make you forget some of the earlier awful sequels. I do think it was a mistake for Dimension Films to save a buck and to use some of the ""Scream"" soundtrack (did they think we wouldn't notice?) and not more of the music from the first two films.

However,when I re-watched it on Showtime,it was alot different. The acting by Arkin and Williams wasn't as poor as I originally thought and Curtis was believable too. Some parts were suspenseful while others were slow-moving. I did not like how they copied the first Halloween with such lines as ""I guess everyone's entitled to one good scare."".
But the mother and son parts were dramatic and admirable. The scariest part was when the little girl went to a public restroom with her mother. You knew Michael was around somewhere.. The killer wears the same old jumpsuit and carries the same old kitchen knife. The previous Halloween (The Curse of Michael Myers) is better largely because it's more original. Michael uses a variety of deadly weapons and we also know more about his Pagan roots. H20 dropped all of these concepts and sort of fell back to the simplicity of parts 4 and 5. But H20 has better acting and more likeable chacters than those two. Overall,not a bad installment,but certainely not an upgrade.

Can't say the same about 6 but Im flexible.  This movie dosen't deal with 4-6 at all.  The director, Steve Miner, ""totally"" discredited anything from the others.  In an interview I seen he just thought 4-6 was a joke.  Here's the joke:  Halloween H20.  I mean, I did like the movie.  It was fine if your a hard core Halloween fan but the fact that 4-6 never existed creates a sort of paradox and loop hole.  It's just hard to get past with actually enjoying the movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) is back and the head mistress of a school.  I never did like her.  Josh Harnett and Michelle Williams show up with there bad acting and LL cool J hurt my eyes while he was on screen.  These actors really hurt the movie for me.  I think Steve Miner seen Scream and I know what you did last summer and tried to capitilize on the target audiance.  What better way to do that then to put in these popular hopeless actors.

Hyping itself up to be a new ""post-modern"" take on Michael Myers. The ""Scream Generation"" of the time woudln't fall for any of the same old trash. Yet the movie does nothing but deliver exactly that.
It has NOTHING to do with the last 5 Halloween movies, so don't go looking for anything involving the man in black or Jamie or the druids cult. And is NOT scary or frightening or worth any attention. Characters are there only to be killed, it's an insult to the actors that their only function is to pad out the length of the movie (a whopping 84 minutes) with their deaths.
Well, perhaps Michelle Williams is worth attention and is the only reason for watching this piece of crap. But it's not like she's in it much. The film is only 84 minutes long and has about 5 scenes. I don't even consider this to be an official Halloween movie. It was only made to cash in on the ""Scream"" craze of teenagers being staked by a masked killer. Seeing as how Halloween was the very first Slasher flick I guess Miramax thought that this would be the Zenith of the craze. How wrong they were.
All deaths are pointless and meaningless and Jamie-Lee's attempt at being a Ripley-like chick with balls doesn't work. Plain and simple.
File this movie under bad. Really, really bad. Jason Voorhees, come back, all is forgiven.

987579,4,6305171769,"Alright, I think that if you're reading this, chances are you recognize that the Halloween movies are now a staple of modern horror flicks. But let's be realistic-it's all about the money, and as sequel after sequel has proven, Michael Myers can certainly rake it in. This 7th installment is in my mind the third and final chapter in the story of Laurie Strode, who comes to realize her evil brother Michael is out to kill her, at any cost. The movie's soundtrack was lacking in the originality department(I suggest John Ottman's original score for the movie, entitled ""Portrait of Terror"") and it was definitely too short. However, it cleanly deals with the truth of Haloween: When the evil comes to find you, you must face your fate.  3,4,5,6,and the forthcoming 8 may be good movies, and any true Halloween efficionado should own them (except for 3-what the heck was with ""The Season of the Witch"" anyway? ). But ""Halloween"", ""Halloween 2"" and ""H20:Twenty years later"" are the true embodiment of what terrified us all one Halloween night, all those years ago.",971136000,,1062,4.835164835164835
987580,3,6305171769,"Anyone planning on seeing or buying this movie should know that it does not really make sense when viewing Parts 4, 5, and 6.  Jamie Lee Curtis, who is terrific in this one by the way, has said in numerous interviews to forget those films and watch Parts 1, 2, and H20 as the definitive trilogy.  That being said, the best parts of H20 are when our lead actress is on the screen.  Whether it be from having nightmares, being a teacher, having lunch with Adam Arkin, or duking it out with her brother, Michael Myers, Curtis is great to watch.  The bad parts of the film involve the lead young actors, including Josh Hartnett (The Faculty), who plays the son of Laurie Strode (Curtis), and his cheesy girlfriend, played by Michelle Williams of TV's Dawson's Creek fame (is this H20 or Dawson's Bloody Creek?).  Both are horrible.  I enjoyed the two other costarring friends of theirs much better.  At least they had some wit and humor about them that was fun.  LL Cool J is enjoyable standing around through the whole movie as a security guard, convincing his wife that he wants to be a romance novelist by reading excerpts to her over the phone when he should be working.  But the film focuses too much on the son and the girlfriend.  Maybe that wouldn't be so bad if the people playing the parts could actually act.  You might think I'm being a bit harsh but I couldn't find any redeeming qualities between the two of them.  The only scene where he even helps his Mom is at the beginning after she's had her nightmare (He gives her medication and calms her down).  But are we to believe that he doesn't really love his Mom?  That he just feels obligated?  That he's resentful of her acting nuts over a supposed killer he's never seen?  That she's just a head case he can't wait to get away from rather than support?  I know horror fans might not care, but this film could've been 100 times better if this relationship was better developed.  If I had a choice I'd have picked Tobey Maguire (Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules) as the son and Natalie Portman (The Professional, Heat) as the girlfriend.  See, they can actually act.  They could pull it off.  But I guess a Part 7 horror movie doesn't exactly attract alot of good young actors.  John Carpenter (Halloween 1) even turned down the opportunity to direct the film after Jamie Lee Curtis offered him the chance.  And as for Big Mike?  To me, Nick Castle will always be the real Michael Myers.  It's just the way he moves and his subtle gestures that define him to the role, while the others (mostly stunt people) ended up only trying to imitate him, but nowhere near having the same effect.  So watch the movie mainly for Jamie Lee Curtis's performance.  She's the best thing about this movie.  But if you're planning on buying this film on DVD, I feel you're getting gypped because it is very expensive and only has a trivia game, music video and a short ""making of"" featurette on it (not even a trailer).  The copy I own says on the back that an audio commentary by Director Steve Miner and Jamie Lee Curtis was offered but it's actually not even on the disc.  To Dimension Films, I just want to say this is false advertisement.  As for their being a Halloween 8?  Only time will tell.",969667200,14,3247,4.469387755102041

This film does just about what you expect it to at  each point. Therefore, it isn't that great.
  Horror film addicts were  happy to see Jamie Lee Curtis return to the role. This is one of the  reasons the film did as well as it did. However, I wasn't so much impressed  with her as I was the new talent the film displayed. I was particularly  impressed with newcomer Josh Hartnett's performance as her son.

There are instances of wit and respect for the original Halloween in keeping the plot simple and gore to a bare minimum but there's nothing creative or scary here you anticipate ever single scare (which again resorts to loud and sudden orchestra hits) This film, I think, is just cashing in on the the success of Scream and carries alot of it's bubble gum style. I felt empty at the end credits because I was really looking foreward to a fresh experience. Even their marketing scheme is typical with the fresh expressionless faces of the stars emerging out of the dark to form a row of faces. Really! Are they trying to show off their diverse collaboration, showing how different cool people can make a cool movie? Or were they impressed by the Gap commercials and just had to steal their style?

987620,4,6305171769,"I think the key to enjoying the ""Halloween"" series (with the exception of the unecessary part 3) is to look at it as 2 separate (but not remotely equal) trilogies.  That said, ""Halloween H20"" is the  perfect conclusion to the first 2 films.
I choose to suppress the  memory of parts 4-6 (the last of which made me physically ill), so when I  learned Jamie Lee Curtis was returning, I was very pleased to know that the  franchise didn't in fact die with Donald Pleasance.  The story of  ""H20"" is its strongest suit.  To find Laurie Strode 20 years  later in any other condition than completely dysfunctional, would have been  unrealistic.  You don't get stabbed, chased and generally spooked by your  boogie man brother and not be nursing a few wounds.  Jamie Lee Curtis'  growth as an actress since the first 2 films allows her to play  Laurie/Kerri truthfully and effectively.
Some may complain that  ""H20"" lacks the shadowy atmosphere of the original, which was  never effectively replicated in its sequels.  What Director, Steven Miner  has done is take the style of the slick, self-referrential  post-""Scream"" horror flick and applied it to the monster who  started the slasher genre in the first place.  Janet Leigh's cameo is a  brilliant touch to a script that has Laurie uttering dialogue verbatum from  the original.  At a mere 80 minute running time, ""H20"" gives you  the set-up in the first half of the film and then proceeds to  relentlessly  pummel you with constant scares until the end credits.  This movie NEVER  gives you a chance to remove your hands from your eyes.
The original  ""Halloween"" is a bonafide classic and ""Halloween: H20""  is the perfect conclusion to a franchise that was in SERIOUS danger of  becoming one that made you laugh instead of made you scream.",962236800,,1787,4.792079207920792

I think  that H20 shoud tied in ALL the entries but alsa it only focuses on 1-2. The  thorn sub polt is great, and gives a little clarity  to the celtic word  written in blood  in part 2. Hopefully in the next entry they will tie in  EVERYTHING. I also that the movie pack in the suspense, but the scares were  limited for me since the mask in all my bluntness is stupid looking.

  It's twenty years later and  Micheal has come back for another round of mass murder. This time he manages  to pull it all off with style,and much suspense abounds. Originality is  still a problem however,as this is a virtual composite of Halloween 1,and  2,Black Christmas,Friday the the 13th parts 1,2,3,and 4,and Scream and I  Know What You Did Last Summer too of course. Nothing really new here see,and  it does miss out on some chances to shake up the audience favoring some  rather dull stretches of exposition.
  The last thirty minutes borders  continually on dumb but a somewhat unexpected twist in the end and some  smatterings of the original Halloween theme more or less make up for  this.

I have always considered Michael to be the best slasher  character since the original Halloween was first released.  I wanted to  like this, I really did, but it was terrible.  The story was pathetic, the  climax was anything but climactic, the acting was lackluster, and Michael  just wasn't as menacing as he's supposed to be.

987723,4,6305171769,"For those of us who have followed the Halloween movies from the beginning, let me offer a little advice to those who have not. Watch Halloween, Halloween 2 and H20, and don't even bother to watch any of the poorly made,  low budget sequels that were made inbetween. Usually,they stray from the  original plot and try to ""out do"" or ""out gross"" the  previous attempt, and in the end they make a mockery out of the series.  That's why I was so pleased with H20. A little dissapointed too, but still  pleased. Although the director picked up where #2 left off (thank god), he  also  falls into what I refer to as ""The scream theme.""  What I  mean by that is, he adds too many newer, qualities of today's film making  into movie. Laurie's messy headed son (the kid from The Faculty, I forget  his name, and LL Cool J (Cool J is cool, but he's no actor), when he should  have gone back to Carpenter's style of having unknowns in those parts, to  give a sense of newness to the film.

987725,5,6305171769,"Wow, When I first heard of the making of Halloween H20, I thought ""damn, as soon as a really good horror film comes along, they ruin it with about a dozen sequels"".  However, after seeing the film more than  twenty times, I decided that this film was spectacular.  There is something  in the Halloween films for everyone.  The Halloween films all contain  suspense, violence, gore, supernatural occurences, but also displays a  touch of reality.  The plot of the Halloween films may seem  confusing, but after thinking, I figured it out.  The original Halloween  was filmed in 1978.  Halloween H20 was filmed in 1998.  You people do the  math.  All of the films that are in between, take place in between the  beginning and ending films. The character ""Michael Myers"" would  have been the age of 41 during this film; in his prime.  The movie  itself has only one main goal; which is to put an end to Michael Myers.  In  the 6th, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"", they took Michael's  strength WAY to far.  What I mentioned earlier, about a touch of reality  was that; Michael always seemed to be stronger than the average man, now  unless he goes to the gym, and benches about 400 lbs., then he isn't going  to be killing people in the manner that he does; violently, and powerfully.  On the other hand, Michael never acutually seems to go beyond the realm  that an average psychopath that suffers from schizophrenia would, which is  undoubtedly what Michael suffered from, after researching the disease a  little bit.  So, Moustapha Akkad should be commended for creating such an  intresting  psychopath.  I really loved the end of this film.  Jamie  Lee Curtis' character, I think, goes a little nutty herself.  But then  again, the director; Steve Miner, Keeps her sane by briefly showing that  she has emotions towards her handicapped brother.  Michael had put Laurie  through so much hell,  that I'm surprised that she wasn't crazy herself.  I  don't know about the rest of the viewers, but I couldn't handle seeing so  many people die at one time without showing some type of weirdness.  However, I think that this film puts a good end to Michael Myers' life, and  at the same time, gives the enemy a taste of his own medicine.  This was an  outstanding ending to a really, really, good story.",953164800,,2295,4.7030456852791875

987771,5,6305171769,"Halloween H20 is a great addition to the series. Giving a long-overdue return to the series that gave her an entire career is Jamie Lee Curtis, as Laurie Strode, now hiding in terror from her brother, the immortal Michael  Myers. She's an alcoholic, and suffers from hallucinations and waking  nightmares. However, I did have some problems with Laurie in this movie. To  look at her, one would think that her daughter Jamie never existed. Any  mother would have been upset at abandoning her child, but not Laurie. There  isn't so much as a photo of Jamie to be found in her office or home. And  why did she think it was necessary to abandon Jamie? So her faked death  would appear more plausible? And if so, how did her ex-husband and son  manage to fake their deaths with her? This movie opened up many more  questions than it answered for me. However, Laurie finally took her revenge  against Michael and redeemed herself. This was actually very cleverly  foreshadowed in the classroom discussion of Frankenstein. This movie also  contains neat little tip-of-the-hats to the first movie, such as Molly's  line about confrontation being 'Victor's' fate, and Janet Leigh's ""I  guess everyone's entitled to one good scare,"" crack. This is also the  first Halloween to be made without the hero, Dr. Loomis, since Donald  Pleasance sadly died after Halloween 6 was made. However, also returning to  her role after almost 20 years was Nancy Stephens as Nurse Marion. You  remember her, she was with Dr. Loomis in the first two movies. Sadly,  Marion does not survive this one. This was an excellent movie, although the  body count was amazingly low. However, Chris Durand did not give an  especialy memorable performance as Michael Myers. George Wilbur (4 & 6)  still did thebest job as Michael, though it doesn't look like we'll have  the chance to see him in the mask again. Or will we? I don't know about  you, but I've already got my cash for ""Halloween H2K; Evil Never  Dies"" ready, and I'm waiting for this announced sequel with baited  breath. H20 however, was a spectacular return for Jamie Lee Curtis, and  it's good to know that the original heroine was not killed after all!",951091200,,2181,4.777479892761394

The passing of time is  also another flaw. 26 years should have passed, not 20 if you view the  previous.

987822,3,6305171769,"The concept was certainly intriguing, though the idea seems to work better just as an idea than when put into execution.
Jamie Lee Curtis is no longer effective as a scared horror-film victim, but alas -- all of the  first half of the film has her precisely in that dreaded position.  Her  very entrance as a character -- waking up screaming from a nightmare -- is  preposterously insulting.  The ""Mr. Brennan"" character is both  horribly written and acted by Adam Arkin -- boy toy, hornier than any of  the kids, and quite simply an ineffective confidant for the main character  by virtue of how weak he is as a character.
It doesn't help that H20  overuses one of the most cliched and ineffective of '90s horror-film  devices, the false scare.  Urban Legend and H20 both overdose on this  device of having some kind of harmless character enter frame, a phony  reaction from a character, with what John Carpenter called a  ""stinger"" (loud, abrupt, usually percussive music cue) on the  soundtrack.  I usually burst out laughing on every occasion after the  second appearance of this device on any film.  This is not true  horror.
That said, H20 picks up steam midway through -- first, when the  Laurie Strode character finally starts to confront Michael Myers.  Long  overdue, and Curtis captures the grim determination well.  Michelle  Williams is all but wasted in the ""Molly"" role which basically  requires her to scream and act hysterical.  Josh Hartnett fares better as  Laurie's weary son John, and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is lively as one of the Myers  victims, Sarah (thin character, but much more entertaining to watch than  Williams').  LL Cool J is quickly turning out to be an infallible comic  sidekick (also see Deep Blue Sea) just by being there.
Director Steve  Miner nails some nice atmospheric moments -- the series of dissolves inside  Dr. Loomis' abandoned room, for example.  But H20, like all of the  Halloween sequels, fails to achieve the subtlety and sustained atmosphere  of the original.  In the original, a tingling piano builds up the tension  while Michael Myers is *always* present so that there's always a sense of  danger.  In all of the sequels, the classic score gets overarranged with  synths and strings, tension is chopped up and diluted, and Michael Myers is  little more than another masked killer (""horror"" sequences and  ""dramatic"" sequences in the sequels are too often separate and  distinct, making them extremely predictable).
H20 is worth a watch for  the nice brother-sister showdown between Laurie and Michael, especially  when the film itself pokes fun at Michael Myers' legendary invulnerability  (Laurie in this sequel *knows* Michael is never quite dead).  As a horror  film, it lacks the merciless grip.  As an action flick, it just might pass  the test.",947203200,,2802,4.956709956709957

Did he go into hiding too,  was it Jimmy from Halloween 2 or someone else?  Did Jamie and John have the  same father?  This movie left many unanswered questions.  For the Halloween  fans that follow the series closely this was probably a big disapointment,  but to those who loved the first 2 of the series, this movie probably  rocked!

When Halloween graced our screens, it seemed certain that a  sequel would follow. Shame really, making a part two would have sufficed,  but the movie-making machine deemed it fit to inflict four rather dubious  parts after that.  Reprising her role as original scream queen Laurie  Strode is Jamie Lee Curtis. This time, we meet her twenty years after she  watched her deranged brother seemingly burn to death after mass-murdering  her friends and family. Strode has changed her identity and now heads a  private school in middle-America. Curtis pulls of a nuerotic, paranoid and  damaged personality with a certain air of expertise; while her supporting  cast offer a range of roles. We join Strode on Halloween, where she is at  her worst. We glimpse into her medicine cabinet which tells us that this  woman has had a hard time dealing with her history. Her son is under her  protective shadow, and feels dreadful about it.  Before long, we see  Michael Myers beginning his journey to find Strode. Then the tension,  pulse-racing pace and all other classic Halloween factors come into play.  The cat and mouse chase sequences are brilliant and Strode's final stand  against her monster will put chills up your spine.

We see a lot of new characters in this movie and the  only annoying one is that kid with the huge nose who keeps talking about  getting laid.  Michael Myers is not the same in this movie.  Either it is  the actor, or the fact that Michael is now in his forties.  Jamie Lee  Curtis is still great as Laurie Strode although that scream that she lets  out at the beginning of the movie was a little overdone.  We see some good  humour in this movie as we see Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis' real life  mother, in a good role.  We also see LL Cool J in a good role as a security  guard.  Josh Harnett makes his debut as Laurie Strode's rebellious son.  Even though he has a best friend with a huge nose, his girlfriend is pretty  nice.  So is the girlfriend of the best friend with the huge nose.  Sorry,  I got a little off topic there.  Anyway, Halloween H20 is a great movie.  It is more suspenseful this time.  When you think Michael is going to  strike, he does not.  Either Michael is old and tired or we have a copycat  killer.

By saying the REAL Halloween fans, I refer to the ones who loved the series even before Scream was released and made horror the trendy 'in' thing with  the lame teenage audience.  That's eactly what Halloween H20 succumbs to,  it's a lame film (save the performance of Curtis) cut from the Scream mold  rendering it completel contrived, plotless and just plain dumb. This  pathetic excuse for a sequel ignores parts 4-6 acting as a sequel only to  the first two Myers installments popping the question, ""if 4-6 never  happened, what was Myers doing for 20 years?""  Well it's never  answered, and quite frankly the film never  tries to explain anything.  It's 'hip' in-jokes are tired, it's 'scares' horribly pedestrian and it's  plot, non existant.  No self-respecting horror fan would call this crap  scary because it contains a few jumps, seriousy folks, Halloween H20 is  just junk.

It shows that horror movie survivors don't  just recover after a year like Jennifer Love Hewitt in IKWYDLS. The scene  where Laurie Strode and the shape come face to face after 20 years is  priceless. I'd give it 10 stars!,929404800,,545,4.201923076923077

988265,5,6305171769,"A dying franchise after some awful sequals, 3-6, Halloween H20 brings back life... and death into the series. It brings back everyone's favorite scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis as her highlighted film character of Laurie  Strode, the innocent sister of a homicidal maniac with a fetish for  mutilated teen carcasses. Unlike Freddy and Jason, Michael Myers is still a  worthy stalker, ( though I have to say Wes Craven's New Nightmare was a  superb film ). Also along with Jamie Lee's stunning performance and  revival, some new blood is drained in. Josh Hartnett is so-so, a reasonable  actor ( what the hel's with his hair!!!), Michelle Williams I like, but she  didn't have much of a character to experiment with. Jody Lynn O'Keefe (SP?)  had a shocking scene and had humorous lines, along with L.L. Cool J who was  much better than I had expected, and that Adam Hann Byrd guy, a bad actor  and ugh, he didn't fit into this film well. Oh well though.. he died.. so..  onto the next. Adam Arkin was great and his death was well played. But the  true shining parts were every moment of screen time with Jamie Lee curtis,  her 'Psycho' mother's appearance, Janet Leigh, and the return of the nurse  from the first and second. Those moments already give this film a five.  Also here's a tip, see one and two definately, 3 through 6.. well yo'll  regret it.",922579200,,1352,4.617647058823529

7884836,4,6305171769,"For a 'soft-reboot' (as they're calling it) Halloween H20 makes a fine 3rd installment in this alternate timeline.  I like Halloween 4 & 5, but that 6th installment was just a terrible way to end the long-running series.  While I kinda wish they had incorporated 4 and 5 into the mix, H20 holds well on its own.  The return of Jamie Lee Curtis is very much welcomed after the death of Donald Pleasence (may he rest in peace), who is given a great homage in the beginning of the film.

My only issues are that the characters are forgettable, except for Michael and Laurie (but that's because we've gotten more time with them), way too many jump-scares (seriously, why are these still a thing in today's horror films?) and the running-time feels a little too short.  Don't get me wrong, I'll take a shorter movie over a James Cameron/Peter Jackson running-time any day, but everything happens so fast and ends so fast that it doesn't leave much of an impact like the 1st Halloween did.  Despite that the first movie was short too, it knew what to focus on and how to create a great payoff, with great suspense.  In H20, everything just feels like the run of the mill.  There's very little Michael vs Laurie (just a fair warning).  But when there is, it's a fight we've been waiting for.

I highly recommend this movie to those who are fans of the Halloween franchise.  Look at it more of the official 3rd movie we never got and as a final installment (seriously, just skip Resurrection, this is a much better way to go).",1525478400,,1518,4.5036496350364965
