When I contacted them to find out if they had the correct video, I got some unintelligent reply. They haven't answered my second email trying to clarify my order and it's been over three weeks now.  DON'T BUY FROM HERE !!!!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!!!",1195171200,,354,4.5
8178319,4,6304093349,"These 2 episodes really fall into the more essential Scooby category. The first episode has a normal start with creepy elements. (Good) The disappearance of the professor  keeps us in suspense. We also get to see Scooby and Shaggy's unusual taste in food: 'Liverwurst and ice cream? What will they think of next?' The sassy, but sharp Velmah ofcourse notices the first clue. We are also offered the wonderful chemistry of Velmah, Shaggy, and Scooby. The transition from speculation and wonder to the 'mummy's' first appearance is both funny and spooky. We also get to see Scooby's negotiation methods: SHAGGY ""Won't you stop him for a Scooby snack?"" SCOOBY ""Ok."" SHAGGY ""The whole box??!!"" We get to see Scooby's unusual talent for running off screen and coming back in a uniform suited for the moment. We also are kept in suspense by wondering why the 'mummy' is after a coin. Shaggy also has his killer one liners: ""Oh! It's the creepy coin collector again.' There is a hilarious scene with Scooby, Shaggy, and a statue of Scooby. We also get to see how poor Daphne is always causing accidents. Also, we are offered a gradual recognition of events. Even if you find out the secret identity of the mummy early, it is still fun to watch how it all comes together. The 2nd episode is also quite good. We have a creepy but plausible start. The disappearance of the professor keeps us in suspense. Also, Shaggy and Velmah get separated which creates more suspense. Without revealing too much, a victim is a mislead. (Great) Ofcourse, Shaggy and Scooby accidentally find the important clue. Some of Shaggy's one liners are there: ""I don't like surprises. Especially spooky ones.""  Velmah loses her glasses, and poor Daphne causes trouble by accident again. There is also a harsh reality to the ending of this episode. The movie ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island"" will probably always be Scooby's best to me, but this tape with these two wonderful episodes is a definite must!",1006905600,4,1966,4.813609467455621
8178320,5,6304093349,"Starting with ""What A Night For A Knight"" which is what would today be called the pilot episode of Scooby Doo Where Are You?  Scooby and the gang encounter a seemingly haunted suit of armor in a museum.  It's fun to watch this episode (especially when Freddy says ""It looks like  we've got another mystery on our hands"" or something close to that,  even though this is the First Mystery they stumble onto!)  Scooby and  Shaggy reveal their penchant for snacks, Velma loses her glasses, and all  the fun begins with this episode. ""Scooby Doo and a Mummy Too""  also involves a museum, although this time the creepy undead happens to be  a Mummy in search of a coin.  And he lets everybody know it too!  For fans  of Scooby Doo and cartoons in general or if you have kids and can't stand  that purple dinosaur this and every other tape in this collection is a  great and cheap investment.
