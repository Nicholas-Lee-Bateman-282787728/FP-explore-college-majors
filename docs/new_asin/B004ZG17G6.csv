4508946,5,B004ZG17G6,This movie is definately up there with a lifetime movie.  True to life and makes you think about how to make things different and better in the world.,1358467200,,150,4.357142857142857
4508947,3,B004ZG17G6,"I gave this movie 3 stars which I think was exceedingly generous. I am unable to comprehend how so many people think this mediocre movie AT BEST could ever warrant 4 stars.  It was not all that well written, overall poorly acted and unconvincing and it wasn't even based on a true story from the investigation I have done on it.
  I used to be a big fan of Lifetime and it's movies but there are rarely any well made, good quality movies made by Lifetime, Hollywood or by anyone for that matter anymore.
  I yearn for more movies like Gracie's Choice, Lies My Mother Told Me and Homeless to Harvard. THOSE were enthralling, well written, very well acted and in a league far from this movie.
  I guess if you are looking for something to pass the time this movie is ok..... otherwise get real with the ratings people!!",1341100800,2,817,4.406666666666666
4508948,4,B004ZG17G6,"Accused at 17... I looked everywhere fore this movie when I was in the U.S. the first time, bacause I love Nicole Gale Anderson, I've seen her in J.O.N.A.S. and in Make it or break it and saw that she was in this movie so I watched the trailer and loved it.. But I couldn't find it anywhere so I went here where you have everything... I like this movie bacause you know who did what though the whole movie and you get mad at some people while you watch it... :) I like that I can seen myself in some of the people.. watch it if you like to stream at you tv and cry for the people in it :)",1338508800,,588,3.8278688524590163
4508949,5,B004ZG17G6,"I bought this movie for a Nicole Gale Anderson fan, who was dying to see this movie she absolutely loves the movie and insists on watching it during movie night.  So glad I bought this film",1335312000,,189,4.25
4508950,5,B004ZG17G6,I taped this on demand on lifetime. This is a very good movie. This why not to play pranks on other people. And why are you fighting over a loser boyfriend anyway. It was thrilling and highly entertaining.  I loved it.,1294099200,2,218,4.317073170731708
4508951,4,B004ZG17G6,"Lifetime movies are hit-or-miss affairs, typically high on drama but lacking in the plot/acting department. This movie is an exception to that. The story involves a group of four teenage girls, one of which is the outsider in the group. The three other girls decide that they should play a prank on her, which predictably goes terribly wrong, as teenage pranks typically do.

This prank, however, results in murder, and of course the three girls try to pin it on the other one. This sounds like a story that has been re-used over and over again. and it is, but the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. Cynthia Gibb gives a strong performance as a mother in a tight spot trying to prove that her daughter is not a murderer.

This DVD will not play on standard US DVD players, as it is region 2. However, the movie typically runs on LMN and Lifetime frequently. Recommended if you are a fan of movies like ""Sorority Row"" and ""The Woods.""",1293494400,7,938,4.511764705882353

4508954,5,B004ZG17G6,I like the movie a lot. It makes a good point it just shows who your friends really truly are,1395187200,,93,3.7
4508955,5,B004ZG17G6,when you are young and trusting of others its hard to believe that the closest to you could be the ones that hurt you the most.  i recommend this to teens and parents of teens.  when it comes to things like this you will see how fast your friends will turn on you like the plague.  that went way back to my time.  way way back to the 80's hehe.  mothers watch with your children or grand children.,1393804800,2,397,4.038461538461538

4508958,4,B004ZG17G6,"When Bianca finds out her boyfriend cheated on her with Dory, a classmate, she's furious and out for revenge. Bianca and her best friends, Fallyn and Sarah, team up to play a prank on the girl to make her pay.

The 3 lure her to a remote location, intending to abandon her, so she has to walk home alone in the dark. But, when Dory doesn t show up to school the next day, everyone, including Bianca, starts to worry.

It s not until Dory's dead body is found and Bianca, and her mother go to the police, that this childish prank leads to an more adult outcome -an outcome where one murder may not be enough to silence the truth.",1390521600,,628,4.181818181818182
4508959,4,B004ZG17G6,"The people who made this movie may not admit it, but this movie sounds to me like it is loosely based off the Shanda Sharer story. Only there were four teenagers who killed the twelve year old Shanda over another girl. That whole case was a mess. This story, Accused at 17, is very similar with a few small tweaks. When I first saw this movie I had no idea something similar and so horrible actually happened in real life, but people seem to enjoy reliving this type of story, why? I have no idea. Probably because it's so crazy that you can't really make any of it up. You think, really? who comes up with this stuff? Who would think of this? If you knew Shanda's story you wouldn't think this movie was so great. Although this movie is toned down quite a bit, I just wouldn't want to watch it again. Not knowing what I know now.",1384041600,,830,4.226415094339623

8449716,4,B004ZG17G6,I think this movie was ok-the acting was atrocious but I ordered it under the assumption it was the movie about Skylar Neese and it wasn't.  That was my mistake.  It is a good thriller and I think it would be a very good movie to watch with a pre-teen girl as an example of bullying in school.,1446336000,,293,4.0344827586206895

8449718,4,B004ZG17G6,"A 17 year old wants to attend a party with her boyfriend but her mother trying to win over a new boyfriend wants her to attend a dinner he is cooking especially for her.  Consisting of live lobsters posted in a regular postal box (I really hope that isn't legal in America).  The dinner doesn't go too smoothly when the mother's boyfriend gives her the type of gift he should be giving to her mother and besides being creeped out the daughter looses it when the creep tells her he got the idea from the poster on her bedroom wall, the poster being the last place she enjoyed her father's company before he died.

The 17 year old is told she not only missed the party but that her boyfriend slept with her friend who is of course labelled a fair few derogatory things by the ""Mean Girls"" type trio.  They decide to have their vengeance on the girl (instead of the boyfriend who you would think is the one to blame) by inviting her to a frat party but secretly taking her to a remote area where the cheated on 17 year old girl awaits to give the girl a beating, with the plan the three would drive off in their separate cars leaving the girl the boyfriend cheated with to find her own way home.  For reasons not really made clear, we just have to assume one was a complete psychopath, after the cheated on girl drives off, one of the other two decides to bash in the girls skull with a rock.  She tells the not too bright other girl that she will be an accessory to murder is she tells anyone.  Of course when the murdered girl is reported missing it isn't long before the police learn of what happened at the party.  If no one says anything, they might get away with their crime, but the problem one of them doesn't how bad the crime actually was.

It's a predictable movie, but it's not a bad light thriller.  The only thing I thought the creepy potential stepfather angle never played out at the end, I mean buys her flowers at one stage, you're just waiting for him to show his hand and the mother to catch onto what's happening there and realise whose feelings should have been more important way back at that dinner and throughout the time she's been dating him.",1439856000,,2166,4.2997542997543
