1671015,5,B00005V4XH,"This Kung-Fu classic has never been given the DVD treatment it deserves. And if the quality of this release is anything similar to that of the Dragon Dynasty's release of 36th Chamber then we are in for a real treat!  The story, choreography, set design, cast, etc... are all stellar!!!  Not to be missed!",1185753600,2,305,4.62962962962963
1671016,3,B00005V4XH,"Love this movie Jackie Chan at his best before the nose job. You see he is the Martial Art Instructor for the movie. And you see he does all the stunt in the movie, and the way they shoot the scenes is classic Hong Kong Cinema, where you actually see all the technics. But the copy is horrible, I saw the original in the theater and I swear it's the same move just copied to DVD, had same 35mm scratch lines in it, I thought they would try to remaster it, but it isn't a Criterian version and I should have known better. And I was ripped off with the price I paid ($65). I see the price has dropped quite a bit now.",1166486400,,615,3.967741935483871
1671017,2,B00005V4XH,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL",1139097600,4,924,4.8544303797468356
1671018,4,B00005V4XH,THis film is boring but the kung fu is brilliant! 8 kung fu masters get together to write a book which contains secrets of each of their styles. When they are murdered somehow Jackie ends up with the book. Everyone tries to steal the book from Jackie but ofcourse they have to fight my hero (Jackie) first!,1037059200,3,306,4.385964912280702
1671019,5,B00005V4XH,"This is, hands down the best Jackie kung-fu movie ever made! It has some of the best fight scenes ever filmed and the story is actually very good and has somewhat of a twist ending. By far, this is the ULTIMATE JACKIE WUP-[rear]S movie!  This film was done before Jackie found a sence of humor, and he lets loose on all who oppose him, even the chicks(they are awesome kung-fu in their own right).  All the action leads up to my favorite fight scene at the end.... DO NOT PASS UP THIS MOVIE!!!!!  If you are thinking, don't! Just buy it!",1013644800,7,537,4.297029702970297
1671020,3,B00005V4XH,"Before obtaining more artistic control over his films, Jackie Chan churned out several low budget chop-socky flicks fo Lo-Wei, director of Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection"".  Despite this rather impressive credit,  Lo-Wei possessed unfounded delusions of competence.  The vast majority of  the Chan films that he directed have only one bright spot: Jackie Chan.  By  far, ""Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin"" is the best of these early  Chan films.  ""Snake and Crane"" focuses on various kung-fu schools  and factions fighting Chan for the possession of a martial arts  instructional book.  (The story is better than it sounds.)  At any rate,  this means that the entire movie becomes one long fight scene after  another, interspersed with comical attempts to ""charm"" the book  out of Chan.  Chan's co-stars all fight and act with some credibility, an  element often absent in other Lo-Wei efforts.  If possible, I would give  ""Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin"" 3 & 1/2 stars.  Since I  rate Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection"" at 4 stars, this should  give some indication of the quality of ""Snake and Crane.""",927331200,4,1109,5.044444444444444
7956019,5,B00005V4XH,Anyone who knows about classic kunfu knows this is a classic. Story is awsome and Jackie Chan played his lead role with excellence in the arts.,1522800000,,143,4.538461538461538
7956020,4,B00005V4XH,"I had this on vhs many years ago and have always had fun watching it. The basic plot of the movie is that the 8 master's gathered at an old temple to combine the best of each one's technique to form the ultimate  fighting style. But a masked assassin kills all but one of the masters. Jackie is sent out to find the identity of the killer. The plot moves well and the fight scenes are nice. The movie is full of interesting characters. Kam Kong also stars in this. Released in ""78"", if you're into old school kung fu movies then this is right up your alley. My only problem with this version was that some scenes are cut by a few seconds but they did restore a scene near the end that was cut from The vhs. The picture is vhs quality and no subtitles.",1489968000,,751,4.108843537414966
7956021,3,B00005V4XH,"This film has wonderfully fluid action but is scarce in all other departments. Drama is barely existent. Neither is the plot. Characterizations are minimal. There are a couple scenes with sexily dressed women including Nora Miao. There are also a few nice one liners. So, if you want to see what is mentioned above with absolutely nothing else to it, be my guest. I would recommend viewing this film though for Jackie's Artistic action setpieces.",1470268800,,446,4.96
7956022,3,B00005V4XH,"The flaws with this particular version are...

1. Missing 5 minutes of footage.
2. Subtitles are dubtitles (meaning the ""subtitles"" actually follow the dubbed script).
3. Picture quality is...meh

The best version out there is the HKL (Hong Kong Legends) version, which is R2, COMPLETELY uncut, undubbed, and very well remastered.",1433635200,,330,5.450980392156863

7956026,5,B00005V4XH,"With over 60 Jackie Chan movies in my DVD collection I can honestly say that 'Snake And Crane Arts Of Shaolin' is one of my favourites. It has personality, humour and many wonderful fight scenes. But I am writing this review to let anyone interested in buying it know about the differences in the released versions.

I have this movie on DVD 3 times. The first version I bought (released in 1997 by Simitar) presented it with dubbed English audio and in 4:3 aspect only. I keep this version because it offers a rare Jackie interview as a special feature.

The second version I bought was the US release presented here on Amazon with the cover featuring an orange and yellow close up of Jackie, and the small picture of him fighting Nora Miao in the bottom left hand corner. This purchase I was very happy with since it presents the film in its full widescreen glory and with proper Mandarin audio and good subtitles. It also provides English audio and a theatrical trailer. The picture quality is good, and the sound is very good.

Then finally (and only just the other day) I purchased the 'Hong Kong Legends' Ultra-Bit version of this film. The picture quality is excellent (as you would expect), and definitely superior to the US release described above. It offers both the English and Mandarin audio in excellent quality.

But there my praise for this release must stop. For some bizarre reason 'Hong Kong Legends' have presented an alternate Mandarin audio track, and in both mono and stereo. The problem here is that it is a dubbed Mandarin, and not Jackie's voice at all. In fact, it sounds as though the same guy did the voices for all the male characters in this film! To add to this problem is the remastered subtitles HKL have presented. They are awful and ruin scene after scene for me. The spelling and clarity of the subtitles are fine, but they keep saying stupid things, and it takes away from the film in a big way.

So my final verdict? If you want the best picture quality and don't care about anything else, go for the 'Hong Kong Legends' release. But if you want the proper original Mandarin audio and great subtitles, go for the US version presented here on Amazon. The widescreen picture quality might be a little inferior to the HKL version, but the superior audio and subtitles make it a far more enjoyable experience!",1316822400,3,2343,4.609112709832134
7956027,5,B00005V4XH,"Jackie Chan delivered some amazing fighting techniques in this particular film. I remember seeing this movie at blockbuster video. During that time it was released by ""simitar"" productions, but I never rented it. After I saw a preview of this movie on the internet; I was impressed. I later found out that ""Sony tristar"" release this video, and I had to see it. It is interesting to see a lot of jackie Chan films, but most of jackie Chan films is mix with comedy and a little of drama. Some of his films center around him as an orphan- which means someone that does not initally know kung-fu until later on in the film. This particualr film, however, shows jackie at his full potential. His martial arts skills are truly epic, and makes you wonder why true martial arts films are a thing of the past. This particuar film was directed by Lo Wei; a famous director known for helping legendary Bruce Lee showcase his skills. Jackie Chan was cast in several Lo Wei production films, until he later ventured into other productions.

This is a true martial arts film, which shows Jackie Chan perform some epic kung-fu. This film is more like a drama with a revenge plot mix with a cocky stylish Jackie Chan performance. Jackie Chan fans will love this classic film.",1310083200,2,1260,4.6
7956028,5,B00005V4XH,"The martial arts sequences in this movie are some of the best ever filmed.  No quick cuts. No camera gimmicks.  Just some awesome, amazing choreography by an wonderful cast of men and women.",1309737600,,190,4.7272727272727275
