3528103,4,B001DB6J5U,"This movie, written and directed by Tom Holland, is a must see if you have not seen it yet or in a long while. Yes a little retro 80s but still funny and the second highest-grossing horror film of 1985. Sequel to this film bombed in 1988. Plot, teen boy lives with single mom.  New neighbor moves in and seems suspicious, moving only at night carrying around large full trash bags, not to mention some long sharp fingernails. Nobody listens to teen boy about his suspicions. Roddy McDowell (star of the original Planet of the Apes movies) plays Peter Vincent as an aging retired actor turned late night host for the TV show ""Fright Night"", that said teen watches, that airs old spook movies. The movies starred a younger Mr. Vincent as a Van Helsing type vampire slayer, and ya, you see where this is going. Surprisingly it has some scary moments and the Vampire JERRY (I know, right?) and minions are 'dead' serious in a mostly comedic film.

I picked it up again to review and share with my nieces before seeing the remake which stars vampire Colin Farrell & David Tennant (""Doctor Who"") as Peter Vincent a Vegas magician. Haven't seen it yet but sounds like a great duo if they can hold the mix of creepy and humorous too.",1320537600,2,1225,4.513513513513513
