8319898,5,B001LW6N02,"This documentary really captures the heart, soul and culture of the Warped Tour. You get first hand accounts from the artists, fans and organizers themselves. I've seen most projects about this iconic tour and THIS film is by far the one that will leave you with the full scope of what its truly like to be a part of the Warped Tour. I thought it was great! I was entertained the entire time. very cool!!",1400457600,,404,4.4

8319900,4,B001LW6N02,"Hey, I've seen them all too and this one is by far the best!  It's loaded with great bands, some of the best music including complete songs and insider-interviews that the others just do not have.  Watching it feels like you have a backstage pass to all that is WARPED!  Sound quality is better than many of the other documentaries as well.  Set-up the big-screen, turn-up the volume and relive the Warped Tour in your own living room.  This is a really fun video documentary to watch over and over again. Stay Warped Everyone!!",1247529600,2,528,4.574468085106383
8319901,5,B001LW6N02,"A really well-done, not typical documentary that gets to the heart of the performers, the audience, and their world. Good live performances are captured as well. I really enjoyed it and recommend it.",1247184000,2,199,5.0606060606060606
