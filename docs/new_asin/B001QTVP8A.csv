8336270,5,B001QTVP8A,Some research for a project lead me to this DVD. I watched it with my colleagues and we were all incredibly inspired! We were expecting something good but this was excellent! So well done without being maudlin! Hooray for NBC sports! It is so amazing to see the HUGE Beijing stadium filled to the brim with cheering fans for the teams. The Olympics always break barriers among nations. The Paralympics do it 10 FOLD! Everyone should watch this just for an injection of human kindness and a reminder that we are all on one planet moving forward to accomplish goals and live the best life we can. Watch this today!,1371168000,,612,4.572727272727272
