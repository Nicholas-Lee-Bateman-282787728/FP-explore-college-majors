8164107,3,B000LT6ENM,"I love duck hunting enough that I can sit and watch it all summer dreaming of the fall events to come.  While I enjoyed this DVD, I am always hoping for something new or different.  This delivers more of the same, fun to watch but easily forgotten and not one I would return to time and time again",1429401600,,297,4.103448275862069
