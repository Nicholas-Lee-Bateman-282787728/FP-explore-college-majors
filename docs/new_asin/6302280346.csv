7824439,1,6302280346,"WHEN AN ARMS SHIPMENT IS STOLEN IN THE PHILLIPINES, INTERPOL CALLS IN ROBERT MALONE [FRED WILLIAMSON] TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE. THE FIRST TWO FILMS WEREN'T EXACTLY GOOD FILMS THEMSELVES, BUT AT LEAST THEY WERE SOMEWHAT ENTERTAINING. THIS IS UNBEARABLE! HORRIBLE ACTING, POOR PLOTTING, BORING ACTION, AND BORING VILLAINS MAKES THIS THE WORST OF THE BLACK COBRA SERIES. IF YOU REALLY LIKE FRED WILLIAMSON, RENT OR BUY ''ORIGINAL GANGSTAS'' OR ''THREE THE HARD WAY''.",1094774400,,463,5.3561643835616435
