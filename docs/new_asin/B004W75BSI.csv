This box contains Piccolo as the main character for the front cover (as it's a replica from the original Japanese Dragon Box), with six discs in total, a booklet (it's read right to left, as a Japanese manga).

And then, the journey comes to an end (251-291), not to worry FUNimation has announced on their Tweeter that they'll release Dragon Box the Films (Z, not including Dragon Ball originals for now, it's due to license, they'll probably get it later).",1306108800,9,2913,4.673913043478261
4485530,5,B004W75BSI,I own all five of the boxes that came before this one. So take it from me when I say if you don't have but have been thinking of getting the entire series these boxes are the way to go! With 42 episodes and no croping of picture there are 7 discs in 2 hardback book style cases and a hardback book episode guide these are very nice sets! And they look great on a dvd shelf. hopefully they will release dragon ball in this form.,1305244800,2,427,3.9767441860465116
4485531,5,B004W75BSI,Dragon Ball Z is so awesome i have all 5 boxes and i just cant wait untill they released this and the 7th one so i will complete the Dragon Ball Z Sagas,1304467200,2,152,3.6363636363636362
4485532,5,B004W75BSI,This is a great set for Anime collectors and Dragon Ball Z Enthusiasts. An amazing set and a reasonable price.,1356393600,,110,4.55
4485533,5,B004W75BSI,"I am overjoyed to finnally have this. A must for any dragonball z fan! It has origional japaneese or dubbed english, also subtitles if you prefer. Its all origional uncut dbz which is a lil drawn out but i love it. If you want all the action with none of the filler you may prefer dragonball z kai.",1333670400,,298,4.155172413793103
4485534,5,B004W75BSI,The dragon box is awesome and hard to find glad I got mine they are getting rare and expensive just need box 4 now,1330300800,,114,3.7916666666666665
4485535,5,B004W75BSI,"Came very quickly, Great quality, bought as a present for my friends birthday, so I don't know what the disc's look like but since it is wrapped and has no scratches on the box I assume they are perfectly fine. Great experience :D",1323475200,,230,4.372093023255814
4485536,4,B004W75BSI,"For The The Fans Out There That Love Dbz Pick These Up, I Heard That Funimation Is Going To Stop Printing These, Or They Probley Did, Not Shore. All I Know That Whene I Heard About It I Got Scared...lol Anwayz I Juss Bout The Last 2 Remaing Dragonbox At Amazon, That I Needit To Complete My Set, Im So Happy I Cant Wait Untill They Get Here...lol Anywayz If Your A Hardcore Fan Like Me Pick These Up Cuz There Going To Be Hard To Find Price wise.",1321056000,,446,4.022471910112359
4485537,5,B004W75BSI,"this box set is perfect except for one thing they compressed the video cramming 7 episodes on each disc adding a little grain but not really grain it just looks compressed like a good quality you tube video. in the funimation dvd credits at the end of each disc it even says ""compressed by"" and two losers names. it looks better than the widescreen sets just not as clear they messed up bad on the widescreen sets though look at another review to see how they messed up (other than the widescreen part). anyway this is one of the best parts of dbz and you need to see it in full screen with the japanese music and if you can take goku and gohan sounding like kids watch it in japanese its way better trust me!!  if you like it in english thats fine but when boo emerges change it to japanese or you will feel like your a 6 year old watching saturday morning cartoons or something.",1317427200,,880,4.238095238095238
4485538,5,B004W75BSI,"The Dragon Boxes are great, as an owner of both the season sets and Dragon Boxes, I would recommend the Dragon Boxes for hardcore fans of the subbed anime.  They are in 4:3 format instead of 16:9 like the season sets, although this may be a little annoying it's better because that's how the series was made.  In 16:9 format you lose some of the screen. The Dragon Boxes went through a much better remastering process, in the season sets, many lines were deleted do to the remastering process used. They do not include the English broadcast music, so if your not a fan of the Japanese music or the 4:3 format then I would recommend the season sets, I you like both of these then I would recommend the Dragon Boxes.",1313020800,5,714,4.401515151515151
4485539,5,B004W75BSI,The DVD box is great. The only thing that caught me off was the fact that they switched the order of how the disks were placed in the box. It is still great though.,1312416000,,164,3.8529411764705883
4485540,4,B004W75BSI,The sound and cartoon quality is better and a small step up from the orange box series. But they should of made it in HD at least it has all the details. From my understanding and what I seen so far. The Kia series sucks and they edit so much important intense detail from it...,1311379200,,278,4.072727272727272
4485541,4,B004W75BSI,"That's right, I'm talkin' to you! All of the Dragon Ball Z fanbase! The Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box 6 is here! With the original japanese audio, and Japanese/English dub cast.

But enough with the formalities. Here's what I think of this product:

I think this set should only be for fans of the ORIGINAL anime, and I mean with japanese voice cast and all. Anyone else, I reccomend Kai. It's the way Dragon Ball Z was meant to be seen, with most of the filler cut out, a fantastic new English dub courtesy of FUNimation, better script, etc. As for the original japanese fans, I'd reccomend sticking with the Dragon Boxes, since most of the original voice actors are there, and there wasn't much wrong with the original Japanese dub as far as I can tell.",1309651200,2,751,4.474452554744525
8444554,5,B004W75BSI,THIS IS FOR any DBZ fan who grew up watching this as a kid. This doesn't have the Bruce falcuner music on it. It has the original  music from Japan which fit the one for the show.,1487462400,,179,3.8378378378378377
8444555,5,B004W75BSI,Awesome,1470960000,,7,7.0
8444556,5,B004W75BSI,EXCELLENT!,1449360000,,10,10.0
8444557,5,B004W75BSI,Dragon Ball is one of the greatest animes of all time. It was nice to finally get the Z series in a box set. I have them all. Perfect addition for anyone's collection.,1395187200,,167,4.090909090909091
8444558,5,B004W75BSI,It's DBZ! It's japanese uncut! It's 4:3! It's have Japanese BGM with English voice over! This is the one we've been waiting for all these years!,1373155200,,144,4.576923076923077
8444559,5,B004W75BSI,What more can i say? It's a must have for any DBZ fan. It doesn't get much better than this.,1366070400,,92,3.65
8444560,1,B004W75BSI,product did not come in original packageing i am an avid dbz fan and ino this product was open and rewarped dislike the fact the case is not with it its not a collectors item or part of a collection if its not complete,1365465600,,218,3.977272727272727
8444561,5,B004W75BSI,"So it turns out I bought the last copy of this that Amazon had. It's now out of stock. And what did they send me? The DVD cases and book, shrinkwrapped, with an inventory tag stuck onto it. No box. I absolutely can't believe they did this.

EDIT: So now that Amazon has fixed it and I've actually gotten what I ordered, I can rate this correctly. It's pretty awesome. Best video quality we'll probably ever get since Funimation doesn't seem to want to do anything with DBZ now. Sound quality is ok but the original source is pretty old so it's not going to be great. The best though is that IT'S NOT CROPPED like those terrible orange box releases. This is DBZ as it was meant to be seen.",1363910400,2,688,4.251908396946565
8444562,5,B004W75BSI,"I've seen all of the dragon ball z series on the regular ""orange"" box set, but the colors are remastered, I love the ""play-all"" option so you can just play through all the episodes, and each box set comes with a cool book telling you some history about the making-of the series/character bios, etc.! Looooove it!",1360281600,,312,4.589285714285714
8444563,5,B004W75BSI,Well minus the damage that was on one of the disc trays I would say that it was a great deal for me. Thanks you Amazon. Just hated that my tray was damaged was all. But other then that I loved the DVD.,1356998400,,201,3.697674418604651
