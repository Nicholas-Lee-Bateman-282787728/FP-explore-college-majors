8279215,5,B0007QJ1TS,"Los alba?iles was filmed at the height of the golden age of Mexican cinema.  Its actors filmed exclusively with certain studios, and only in very rare occasions would you see them collaborating with other studios.  This is why you often see the same troupe in different movies.

As always, Los alba?iles touches on the subject of the poor vs. the rich, employers who take advantage of their employees, and those struggling to survive.  All the misery and hardships are beared by the camaraderie of the construction workers, and being able to laugh at yourself.  One of the best roles played by Alfonso Zayas and Luis de Alba.  This is classic Mexican comedy at its best!  An excellent film!",1146096000,,690,4.796610169491525
