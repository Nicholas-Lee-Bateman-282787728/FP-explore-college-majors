Three brothers, have decided to establish his own life and certainly the expected brotherhood simply doesn't exist. Due their father's death, they coincide in the Funeral and far beyond the grief and pain, this encounter will allow them to rejoin and somehow to contrast the ineffable differences and standpoints.

Powerful and superb film!",1116288000,,424,5.220588235294118
1716400,3,B000067IXK,"Hands down the worst transfer to dvd I've ever seen. If you know Italian you'll still have the subs on because the sound is totally messed up. Dialogue comes in ever so faintly through the front left speaker instead of the center (and all the speakers are providing hiss. 5.0 surround hiss sound. and the image appears to be transfered from a video source instead of original elements. Result: video burps and vibrating black bars. Ridiculous. Normally I fall back and say: hey, at least it's available at all...but in this case I won't. This is very unpleasant viewing experience.",1069027200,25,581,4.82
1716401,5,B000067IXK,"If you love Italian films, see this...
The story is of 3 brothers who have lost their emotional bond and must deal with it after being reunited at their mothers funeral. Charles Vanel (Wages of Fear - also plays a great cameo in Rosi's 'Illustrious Corpses') plays their father and Philippe Noiret's Judge character brings in a resonance and subtext of 70's Italian terrorism that plays rather freshly in America post 9/11.
Make no mistake, this is an all-star cast, with no American scenery chewing or faux sentiment. Vittorio Mezzogiorno is virtually unknown in the U.S. and that is a crime...watch this 20 times :)",1015459200,13,617,4.885714285714286

7963146,3,B000067IXK,"If you think American politics are a mess, just try and make sense of the chaos that took place in Italy in the '70s and '80s.  Corruption, collusion and power struggles resulted in the high profile assassinations of judges, many of whom were the sole line of defense in a burgeoning war against terrorism and the Mafia, men who gave up their lives as a surrogate for the weak political will of their country.  OK, history lesson over...but it's an essential part of appreciating director Francesco Rosi's Three Brothers (1981), a film based on the work of Russian novelist Andrei Platonov, but predominantly concerned with Italian politics of the day.

The death of their mother brings Raffaele, Rocco and Nicola back together to their small farming village in southern Italy, where their father, Donato, is planning the funeral.  Out of touch with each other and the simple lives they left behind, each man brings along their fair share of emotional baggage.  Nicola is frustrated with an impending labor dispute at work and an impending divorce at home.  Raffaele, a famous judge, is caught between the commitment to his principles and the safety of his family.  While Rocco, a quiet bachelor seems at peace with his almost monastic life.

Their patriarch is having a hard time dealing with the loss of his wife, flashing back to small moments they shared together and reminiscing over old photographs with Nicola's young daughter.  As each man reconnects with his past, they struggle with which path they should take in the future...and maybe finding the answers are much closer to home.

Three Brothers is a uniquely Italian film made up of uniquely personal stories.  One could certainly understand the family drama without a minor in political science, but Rosi isn't pulling any punches when it comes to commenting on current events.  Raffaele's moral conundrum in particular - whether or not to take on a dangerous case that may threaten the life of his family - is central to the cinematic debate.  And Nicola's support of violent protest to bring about improvements in the workplace reflects another hot topic of the time.

But underneath it all is an almost Bergman-like meditation on the accumulation of quiet moments, the roads less traveled and unexpected u-turns that shape our lives.  Rosi's camera lingers on buildings still beautiful amidst the decay, farm trails that disappear into the horizon and landscapes that only improve with memory.  It's Nicola's young daughter who seems to understand the magic in these simple pleasures; suggesting Rosi's message just might be we should all find something to live for instead of something to die for.

An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film in 1981, Three Brothers is actually making its home video premiere thanks to Arrow Films' new blu-ray / dvd combo.  The new 2K transfer cleans up quite nicely after the opening credits, although it seems inherently grainy from the source.  Audio (in Italian with subtitles) is a bit compressed and shallow sounding but an hour-long audio interview with the late director and collectible booklet are included as extras.",1496275200,,3133,5.036821705426356

7963150,5,B000067IXK,"The Cultural Arts Center of St. Louis, LLC highly recommends ""Three Brothers"" as a wonderful way to practice your Italian.  The plot line is family-oriented and very entertaining in all respects.  The film does make you evaluate your own life and count your blessings.  The film does have English subtitles so it can be understood even if you are still in the process of learning Italian.  They do speak fast and is recommended for higher level Italian classes to study and therefore it would not be suitable for beginners.

The film explores the inner workings of the three Italian brothers whose mother had just recently died.  Each brother is completely different in regards to career, personality and personal ambitions.  Two of the three brothers are very positive and professional in nature but the third one is on the negative side and even the wrong side of the law in some cases.  It is very interesting to watch the family dynamics of this Italian family.  Overall, it is a wonderful ""slice of life"" film set in Italy that truly is entertaining and well-done on all levels.  CAC St. Louis, LLC gives this movie 5-stars for Italian drama.

7963152,5,B000067IXK,"It's hard to think of a more beautiful and poignant movie. Three brothers who have lived separate lives in different Italian cities come home to their father's farm for their mother's funeral. Contrasted with the urban rat race of the brothers' lives is the simple idyllic life of the father (played exquisitely by 89-year-old Charles Vanel).

The brothers arrive with all the anxieties and fears of living life in the big city: one brother is a judge fearful of terrorist persecution; another is a teacher at a school for delinquints who sees himself saving the world; and the third is a factory worker who won't be pushed around by the bureaucracy and whose marriage is failing.

This third brother brings his young daughter with him, and only she and Vanel appreciate the simple, saner way of life on the farm. Every scene is packed with emotion, and those scenes with Vanel, especially the two in which he remembers his deceased wife, are utterly beautiful. Watching this movie is a very moving experience, wise and lyrical, not soon to be forgotten. Excellent in every way.",1132444800,5,1078,4.853260869565218
