8229719,2,B000LP5CWU,"This review is not rating the movies themselves...  I recently bought this set solely because of the fact that on the backside of the box it showed a picture of the Crash DVD as the ""2-Disc Director's Cut Edition"".  Well, I bet you can guess how shocked I was when I opened the packaging to find the SINGLE DISC WIDESCREEN version of Crash.  I call this LAME and FALSE advertising, and I'm immediately going to take this back to the store and demand either a refund or an exchange for the 2-Disc.  This is BULL.",1196985600,,511,4.347368421052631
