5571841,5,B00BBXRKHQ,"Judi Dench in her films and stage work is a wonderful boost to entertainment in these days of crime, dissection, and sex.  While Judi does do a range of acting experiences, her early work really motivates me, and this is one of them.

I think you should try this one to compare hits like Shakespere In Love, or Mrs. Brown, or A Fine Romance.  Those early films just prove how talented she is and give you an experience to remember.",1370044800,12,431,4.3625
5571842,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"Had just seen the ""new""version, and I'm afraid I prefer -- but it's always a joy to watch Judi Dench in ANYTHING! She was and continues to be an amazing actress!",1395014400,,161,4.225806451612903
5571843,5,B00BBXRKHQ,"A double history lesson: first a look at the turn of the 20 century through the eyes of a WWI English vet in Ford Maddox Ford, and then a look at English film adaptation coming into its own, not to mention Judy Dench at most charming, innocent and beautiful. A great look at stage actors moving over to screen before they go on to legendary status.",1392249600,8,348,4.287878787878788
5571844,5,B00BBXRKHQ,"I had known of Ford Maddox Ford for years but never got any closer than a handful of literary references.  I found the HBO's recent production (Tom Stoppard, Benedict Cuberbatch, Adelaide Clemens, Rebecca Hall, Roger Allam, etc.) fantastic.  I played the old BBC dvds and found that this production held its own and even added a lot to the understanding of the characters and the storyline.  The only problem was some annoyance with the strident music that introduced and concluded episodes.  A funny thing--the captions must have been a later add-on;  Valentine Wannop (or Chrissy?) is made to say: ""What a savage land.""  Odd?  Checked Ford on my Kindle.  Should have been ""Walter Savage Landor"".

The emphasis was much more on trench warfare and its brutality than the HBO version--and very well done.",1387756800,10,803,4.977443609022556
5571845,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"Black and white and vintage stuff. One of Judi Dench's earliest roles.  If you love old movies, you will enjoy this. It was so ""soothing"" that I kept nodding off and then would have to go back to pick up the thread. Having watched all 3 DVDs, I was glad I did.  The last DVD was the best of the bunch and I didn't nod off.  The series was better than some modern entertainment, but not my favorite Judi Dench role.",1385164800,4,414,4.08641975308642
5571846,4,B00BBXRKHQ,"If you liked the recent, hugely enjoyable, Stoppard adaptation of Ford Madox Ford's great tetralogy, you might well want to compare it with the 1964 BBC version. The earlier, black and white, version is closer to the spirit of the novel than Stoppard's (less 'romantic', more jagged), and definitely compelling in its own way. Ronald Hines and Judy Dench are terrific as Christopher Tietjens and Valentine Wannop though, it has to be said, Jeanne Moody's Sylvia seems one-dimensional compared to Rebecca Hall's. Neither version, perhaps predictably, tackles the fascinating but 'difficult' fourth book of the sequence.",1382140800,11,618,5.447916666666667
5571847,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"Love the new production with Benedict Cumberbach.  Have that on DVR and watch at least one of the 5 episodes every week.  This is just too dated,  The music is the worst.  Judy Densch is fine, but not as sylph-like as I thought the part required.  .  As a historical document it is OK to own, but won't draw you in as the new HBO production does.",1380844800,,346,4.08955223880597
5571848,1,B00BBXRKHQ,"Ordered this movie because enjoy Judi Dench. So awful did not finish watching it. The narrative pitiful, the quality of the film itself even worse. Save your money.",1373414400,,164,4.892857142857143
5571849,2,B00BBXRKHQ,"I love British video,  but this one was very slow, very stilted, very boring and a waste of my money",1373414400,,100,4.0
5571850,2,B00BBXRKHQ,"Watched it yesterday and it was boring a depressing.  Judi Dench was good and the only thing interesting
was that it was her introduction to the big time acting.  I can see why she went on to be a super heroine.",1371772800,,211,4.121951219512195
5571851,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"Must for fans of Judi Dench, who has one of three female leading roles, and not many many scenes.
Well done. It is EARLY TV, so 4:3, black and white.
Star rating is strictly presentation quality.  You are not I, so your taste is not mine.
Two stars deducted for low, but watchable image quality, but today most will find it a turn off.
Sound is fine.",1370736000,2,350,4.223880597014926

8565516,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"Never mind the young, charming Judi Dench- the prize here is the male lead; Ronald Hines in a superb example of ""chamber acting."" The chap is super nuanced. I watched this for the period acting--not to be scorned (all acting is of its period). I've seen most of the BBC lit adaptations from this era (and later) and this is truly the oddest. Weird camera angles and cutting-almost french new wave. Slightly everybody on coke mannerisms. The main problem may be Ford's novel (which to be fair I've never read- while reading most of the other Great War testimonies)- the characters (good man, bad woman, good woman,stuffy general, yikes!) seem very one note,one dimensional and their motivations not at all plausible, the plot-very dubious in human and historical authenticity. But it does have a weird almost SciFi  attraction-just don't expect 21st century realism.",1492041600,,865,5.048951048951049
8565517,1,B00BBXRKHQ,"Skipped through first disk. Didn't bother to watch second. Yelling, odd face-making is not good acting. Boring story line.",1473120000,3,122,5.473684210526316
8565518,4,B00BBXRKHQ,"I haven't read the books, and I haven't yet seen the 2012 Stoppard/Cumberbatch version, so I'm just responding here to what I saw, on its own terms, with less context than I would ideally like.  I found this 1964 black-and-white BBC version to be quite effective but rather narrowly focused on the psycho-social travails of Christopher Tietjens (Ronald Hines), the younger son of a wealthy family (""Tietjens of Groby"").  He's married to the despicable and unfaithful Sylvia (an excellent Jeanne Moody), who seems to be determined to undermine and discredit him with his family and friends, but he meets and falls in love with a young suffragette, Valentine Wannop (Judi Dench).  Before their relationship can be consummated, however, he's off to war -- the trenches of World War 1 -- and their relationship isn't picked up until he returns, by no means untouched by his experience.  The moral interest of the story lies in Christopher's determination to behave honorably, and with Christian forbearance.  He does not remonstrate with Sylvia about her constant slandering and infidelity, and although he is generous in lending money to impecunious friends, he neither expects nor asks for it back.  When others take credit -- both before and during the war -- for work that he gets done, he doesn't complain or put himself forward.  All of this makes him seem saintly, but as played by Ronald Hines, he doesn't come across as a prig, or as an impossibly virtuous person, or as a passive-aggressive monster -- he just seems like a guy living from day to day and trying to do the right thing, as he sees it.  Hines's performance is the glue that holds the story together -- it's a wonderfully engaging and sympathetic portrait -- and, while much of the interest in this release focuses on the young Judi Dench, it's really Hines's show.  Dench is fine, but it's not a big or particularly complicated part.

Where I think this TV version must deviate from the book is especially in the final episode, which is a bit odd.  For one thing, Sylvia disappears from the story, as do Christopher's brother and father, all of whom featured importantly in the first two episodes.  The third episode is given over almost completely to Christopher, back in London, telling Valentine about the horrors of the trenches and of the people he wasn't able to save.  The rhythm of that last episode is between the conversation with Valentine and vivid flashbacks, which lets us see what happened in the trenches after the events of Part 2.  We see Christopher's humanity, his competence as an officer (which his superiors take credit for), his indifference to the social hierarchy that prevails even under stress of war, and, of course, both the physical and psychological cost.  He has returned a damaged man, but there is the sense that his telling the story to Valentine, whom he loves and who loves him, is therapeutic, although the ending isn't in any way a miraculous transformation.  It's Valentine who makes the connection that the plot as a  whole has been inviting us too make -- that what makes the people who hate Christopher hate him is his obvious refusal to hate and despise them!  But just when one thinks that no one appreciates him but Valentine, he does get an uplifting surprise at the end, when he and Valentine are visited by some of his surviving men, not exactly undamaged themselves, and we have a conclusion that has the feel of a Shakespearean comedy about it.  So . . . I'm going to try to see the Cumberbatch version, but there's much to enjoy and ponder in this one.",1466035200,,3574,4.7727272727272725
8565519,4,B00BBXRKHQ,"This is an early Judi Dench movie so her role is relatively small. The story is about World War I and it's devastating impact on the men who fought.
Dench's character and her performance are the bright light in this movie. I do recommend it for the overall acting is very fine and the detail of the trench fighting  cannot to be forgotten.
Dvd arrived promptly and in good condition",1444953600,3,382,4.457142857142857
8565520,3,B00BBXRKHQ,"There's a new version of Parade's End, a 5-part series (2012) written by Tom Stoppard that is one of the best films I've ever watched. It is definitely one of my ""Top 20 All Time Favorite Movies."" Available on Amazon Prime Video or DVD at amazon.com. IMHO: Best director, Best Screenplay, Best Actors, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Every Category. All interior scenes look as though they were staged by Vermeer. The casting and the portrayal of the characters by these actors is absolutely stunning!

Set during WW1, Christopher Tietjens, one of Britain's most brilliant statisticians finds himself fighting in the trenches. He leaves two women behind: his wealthy wife, Sylvia, and Miss Wannop, a woman he has gradually come to know and love. Sylvia is a manipulative, selfish socialite, and Miss Wannop, a suffragette, is someone with a strong sense of duty (like Tietjens).

This 1964 version is okay. It's in black and white. The script is abbreviated. But it is fun seeing Judi Dench, when she was younger, in the role of Miss Wannop.

I bought both this DVD and the kindle book (based on the novel by Ford Madox Ford, ""No More Parades"").  I have watched this 1964 version once, and I've watched the 2012 version several times. I love this story!",1441670400,2,1267,4.851851851851852
