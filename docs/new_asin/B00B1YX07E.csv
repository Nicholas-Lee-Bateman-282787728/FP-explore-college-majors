5552690,5,B00B1YX07E,"I watched this film when it was broadcast on PBS when we did not have DVDs, just video tape and VCRs. I watched it with intense interest. I was delighted that it was finally transferred to DVD recently so I had to buy it for my collection as I have more than a passing interest in the subject matter in the film.
I am a veteran sportswriter for the Gallup Independent newspaper (going into my 31st year, 33rd year overall) and I got to know coach Jerry Richardson and his Shiprock girls basketball teams. I covered a lot of their games during his time at Shiprock. Richardson was always gracious and well-mannered. He certainly was the best-dressed high school coach around.
Watching the DVD brought back a lot of memories of my time seeing those games played between Kirtland Central and Shiprock.
I was saddened to hear about Richardson's untimely death at University of Central Florida when he was killed when a stolen car was going 100 mph, ran a red light and struck Richardson's van and killed him instantly.
Thank you Rick Derby for having the vision and patience to see that this special project was made and that it was finally transferred over to DVD so more of us can remember Richardson and his Lady Chieftain basketball teams. I look forward to your future projects.",1367798400,,1279,4.638766519823789
5552691,5,B00B1YX07E,"This is a great film, and hopefully this white guy can explain why!  First of all, it's very, very real without pretense.  You see the coach, the community and girls as they are.  There seems to be no pandering to any one side, as if the director really wants to tell the true story and let the truth be told and speak for itself.  You see the distrust between the Black coach and the Native basketball team, and the clash of cultures that has to happen.  And, to top it off, you see a couple of great basketball games, that had me on the edge of my seat.  I am not sure if this was the major intention of the film, but what I came up with, among other things, is that no one culture has all the truth, and that in order to grow we have to see outside our own culture.  You see the real growth of the girls and also the coach, but not until the fear and mistrust is confronted head on.  I found this to be a very spiritual film, and I sensed a labor of love to get it done, which is a rare and beautiful thing.  I think the messages of this film will live on for decades, if not centuries.  Congratulations to everybody that was involved, as this is a great American film.  And finally, buy it!",1365465600,6,1194,4.038297872340426

5552693,5,B00B1YX07E,"Unlikely leader lifts 'Hoosiers' of Title IX
By JILL VEJNOSKA

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 12/17/02

From ""Hoosiers"" to ""Breaking Away,"" pop culture is replete with films about young people using athletics to find recognition and a purpose in life.
Usually, they're about young men, because, well, who'd want to watch a movie about girls suiting up and boxing out?
Probably not the folks upset over Title IX, the landmark 1972 legislation that ties college athletic opportunities for men and women to enrollment and is now being given the official once-over. Too bad, because ""Rocks With Wings"" is uplifting without being manipulative, a true tale of self-doubters and strangers who together succeeded far beyond sports.
You needn't love girls high school basketball, or sports, to appreciate this documentary about the all-Navajo Lady Chieftains coming out of nowhere (Shiprock, N.M.) in 1988 to win the first of three consecutive state championships.
In a town where history looms like the huge outcropping the Navajos call the ""rock with wings,"" these girls soared.
It all started with the arrival in 1980 of coach Jerry Richardson, an African-American ex-high school basketball star from Texas. Recalling the obvious surprise at Shiprock High that he was black (his application hadn't included a photo), Richardson says later, ""They needed a teacher, and I couldn't afford to go home. A marriage was made.""
Like many marriages, this one struggled sometimes, in part because of divergent backgrounds. ""Rocks"" is fascinating in showing how different minority groups often experience life's similar challenges differently.
Attending an all-white junior high, Richardson was harder on himself than anyone, pushing to excel. But that approach wasn't easily translatable at first to Shiprock's teen girls.
""For us, we're Navajos,"" says Lady Chieftain Vernee Begay. ""It was like, all our life we've been put down. So it was just more of a put-down when he'd say that 'You've gotta have this self-motivation' stuff.""
Like the best marriages, though, they stuck it out for the best reason: Each changed the other for the better. ""Rocks With Wings"" has its problems -- it needs a narrator and fewer slightly grainy minutes of basketball. But you're certain to find yourself rooting for the Lady Chieftains to finally end archrival Kirtland Central High School's string of eight straight state championships.
And if the ending doesn't make you simultaneously tear up over Richardson's untimely death in a car accident and smile at how Shiprock's success inspired its players and an entire community to dream bigger, then you're a rock. A rock without wings.",1358467200,2,2655,5.319047619047619
5552694,5,B00B1YX07E,"Documentary on Shiprock girls title team a 14-year odyssey
By Paul Ingles

SPECIAL TO THE ALBUQUERQUE TRIBUNE - December 15, 2002

WINDOW ROCK, ARIZ. - Window Rock is a long way from Los Angeles or New York. But earlier this year, it was abuzz with all the excitement of a Hollywood premiere.

The crowd was building in the theater lobby at the Navajo Nation Museum. Television reporters were interviewing the film's actors as they arrived. The director was pacing nervously.

The documentary ""Rocks With Wings,"" which airs Wednesday on PBS, was being screened for the first time to the people whose story it tells: the players, coaches and fans of the Shiprock High School girls' basketball team of 1988, otherwise known as the New Mexico Class Triple-A state champion Lady Chieftains.

Almost all the original team's players and their families came to the special screening in April to see the work of Rick Derby, a white filmmaker from New York who spent 14 years completing the project.  ""I haven't been able to sleep,"" Derby said at the premiere. ""They entrusted me with their story, and now I've managed to get it told. But I hope I told it well.""

The themes of trust, and the threat of violated trust, have been central to American Indians throughout history. And they run strongly through the original story of this all-Navajo girls basketball team's rise to prominence and in Derby's own odyssey of making the film.

The Navajos had always called Shiprock's distinctive rock formation the ""rock with wings,"" which Derby used for the title.  The film establishes early on the sense of limited possibilities that pervaded this New Mexico reservation town in the early 1980s.

This was the environment that a black man named Jerry Richardson walked into in 1980. A star basketball and track athlete from the segregated South of the 1970s, Richardson became an even more stark minority on the Navajo reservation.  He took the reins of the losing Lady Chieftains in 1982 because, he says in the film, nobody else wanted the job.

Richardson drilled the girls on fundamentals and, in the movie, talks about changing attitudes - challenging a Navajo culture that lacked a key ingredient for sports.  ""The Navajo people are not very aggressive,"" Richardson says in the film. ""I was trying to make the girls become aggressive. But that wasn't the attitude of the home.""

Richardson's discipline helped Shiprock climb into the state final by 1987, but all was not well below the surface. Richardson and one of his assistants clashed over how hard to push the girls. The film documents a tense team meeting the night before the final, when a few players spoke up, challenging Richardson's style.

The painful and dramatic truth-telling session is the centerpiece for this film that also includes exciting footage of both the 1987 and 1988 state final showdowns between Shiprock and crosstown rival Kirtland Central. The first, a narrow loss by the Lady Chieftains; the second, a narrow, sweet victory for them.

Bringing this film to this audience at the Window Rock premiere was a long time coming for Derby, who first heard the Lady Chieftains' story in 1988.
""I don't want to call it this divine inspiration, really,"" he says. ""But I felt that this was something I had to do.""

When Derby began filming in 1989 the locals were suspicious of his intent. But when he convinced them he was there to tell the success story of the Navajo girls, their guard dropped. Slowly, he bonded with the players who told their stories.

The community was also impressed that Derby kept showing up year after year. He continued to film as the Lady Chieftains won every state title through 1992. By 1996 he had eight years' worth of film, but lack of money, time and something else was holding him back.  ""My friends would ask, `Aren't you done with that yet?'"" he says. ""And I'd answer them, 'No, the story's not over. Something hasn't happened, and when it does I'll know what that is.'""

That something came in a telephone call to Derby in 1996. Coach Richardson, who had moved on to coach college ball in Florida, was killed when a speeding car in an Orlando intersection hit his van.  ""The minute I heard it, it was so unbelievable,"" Derby says. ""To this day it's still unbelievable. And it is to the folks in Shiprock, too.""

Derby has a hard time explaining why, but Richardson's death seemed to provide some impetus to get the film finished and get the story told.
Although finances were still tight, some grant money helped Derby finish the documentary early in 2001, dedicating it to Richardson's memory. It screened at many film festivals across the country and caught the attention of the Public Broadcasting Service.

Immediately after the special screening in Window Rock, a group dinner turned into both a celebration of the girls' accomplishment and a second memorial for Richardson. Pleased with the movie, the Shiprock players and families also honored Derby.

Cheryl Lee, 32, a starting player on the '87 and '88 teams, spoke for her teammates, her voice cracking with emotion.  ""Mr. Derby,"" she said, ""all your perseverance and your compassion and your love for us, individually, shows.  Thank you so much.""",1358467200,,5211,4.873159682899208

8561170,5,B00B1YX07E,"Rocks With Wings is a powerful story that focuses on the journey of a group of high school basketball players in a Navajo community, and their relationship with their non-Navajo coach. The documentary is exciting, sobering, and inspirational all at the same time because it shows the incredible journey that the team took to reach the championship, while at the same time illustrates the hardship and desperate circumstances that the girls came from. The film also gives great insight into the Navajo community. It is a great watch for anyone.",1475020800,,543,5.044444444444444
8561171,4,B00B1YX07E,I watched this film for my history class and really enjoyed it.  It was interesting from start to finish and gave a voice to Native students.  It gives viewers a glimpse into the life of Native students in Shiprock in the Navajo reservation.  Very often Native voices are not heard so this documentary was a refreshing change.,1475020800,,326,4.684210526315789
8561172,5,B00B1YX07E,Rocks with Wings is an incredibly well-done documentary detailing the story of Shiprock High School's Lady Chieftains. It is an engaging film with powerful themes like overcoming adversity and working as a team. Another underlying message is the state of the Navajo Nation that Shiprock resides on. It gives a real and true look to what those communities are about and the similarities they have to mainstream American culture. This is certainly a must watch.,1475020800,,459,5.133333333333334
8561173,5,B00B1YX07E,"I watched this documentary on late night public TV and even though I had an early shift the next morning, I watched it through to the end.

That being said, Iam not a sports fan...at all.

If you were to ask me the outcome of some contest or another I wouldn't even know where to begin.

I do however, know enough about competition in general to tell you that the final game in this film is riviting...period.

When I finished watching I cranked up the primitive internet, found the contact info for Rick Derby and ask e if a home copy was available.

Long story short, he sent me a VHS copy several weeks later (thanks again, Rick!)

Several years later I was tasked to learn analog to digital for a work related project and I chose Rocks for my test run.

I watch it about once a year, and always when I want to wow someone with a great story told well.",1472860800,,855,4.208588957055214
8561174,5,B00B1YX07E,"This is the story of defeat and triumph, of shame and pride, of weakness and strength. This is not just a basketball story. This is not just a Native American story. This is a human story. This is a story the clash of cultures and personalities, a hard-driving black coach and a team of downtrodden Navajo girls in need of a leader. You do not need to be interested in basketball, Indians or the difficulties of minorities in America to become immersed in this story.

I did not expect the depth and breadth of the story. It was through my own interest in the lives of modern American Indians that I found Rocks With Wings, and I was pleasantly surprised with the inclusion of so much insight into Navajo beliefs, customs and mindset. I expected the movie to be interesting. I did not expect it to be fascinating. Based on the story, I expected it to be inspiring. I did not expect it to be exciting.

I was already familiar with Anglo attempts to make Indians ashamed of their heritage, but I was not aware just how deep this feeling ran among some Indians. It was great to see not only the team uplifted by their success, but the whole community as well. Smiles and pride where there had been little before.

Rocks With Wings is amazing. Not just the story itself, but the way it is told. It is not narrated, the people are simply allowed to tell their stories, and with careful editing, the stories are interwoven with background information and highlights of two exciting basketball games which bring the story to a climax.

Normally I try to bargain hunt my DVDs, so I was at first a bit put off by the price of this one, but this gem is a bargain after all.",1453248000,2,1663,4.407166123778501

After I am done with the DVD I hope to donate it to our local library for a wider audience; it's a bit of history that should be more widely understood.",1406678400,,305,4.066666666666666
8561177,5,B00B1YX07E,DVD was promptly provided for my use. Accessibility to product was simple. Product itself was excellent and informative. I am a pleased consumer.,1395187200,,145,5.3478260869565215
8561178,5,B00B1YX07E,"I recently discovered this documentary and its story and fell in love with it.  I really can't pinpoint exactly what it is, but, obviously, it's about the human spirit and its triumph over adversity.  Though it's about a black coach and an Indian girls basketball team, as a Latino, I relate to it strongly as a person of color.

Before watching the documentary, I looked for all the clips I could find online and researched the coach.  I found out he had passed away and this saddened me.  He came across as such an inspiring and calm presence on his interviews.  He seemed to be such an inspirational and good person that I wanted to know more about him and what he was doing today.

I finally watched the documentary.  After watching, I'd love to know what the girls are up to in the present day, too.  They were a spunky bunch and you couldn't help but root for them.

Let me also say, I'm not really a sports fan.  It's not about that.  Though the girls were really passionate about basketball, it was a means to many ends in the coach's eyes.  This is a human story that anyone should be able to relate to, at the least understand, and, definitely, be moved by.  Basketball fans will be able to appreciate it on another level, though.

The director did such a great job.  Like I said before, I can't explain it.  It's not only that this documentary touched my heart, it's that it has stayed with me in a way that other documentaries do not.  Because it resonated with me so deeply, I'd like to recommend it to everyone.",1391731200,2,1525,4.385714285714286
