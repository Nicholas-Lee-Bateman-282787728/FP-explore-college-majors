8093360,3,B000BVY23O,"While this might thrill the ""new age"" practitioner - and considering I've seen martial approaches interpret forms/routine differently and remain martially viable - this is definitely not as the creator intended by the look of it.  Seek out the work of GM Chen Xiaowang... or even another variant of short modern routine by GM Chen Zhenglei... if you are serious about practicing Chen style Taijiquan but wish for a shorter routine than the traditional Old Frame First Routine (the 38 is derived from it).",1163721600,5,504,5.0
8093361,1,B000BVY23O,"While Master Xing is incredibly expressive, and I would have to believe very passionate in his practice, what is displayed has only a passing semblence to the form as taught by it's creator. If you were to observe tapes of Grandmaster Chen Xiao Wang or Ren Guang Yi side by side with this you would notice almost every one of the 38 forms has differences - some very significant.",1161561600,4,379,4.507246376811594
8093362,3,B000BVY23O,"Likes:  The Chen style is one of the most graceful and dynamic of tai chi styles.  Master Guangzhi Xing is a skilled practicioner and demonstrates the form in a flowing, aesthetic grace and power.  The demonstration of the complete forms is very pleasing to the eye and makes you want to learn the style.
Dislikes:  When the form is broken down in elements to teach the form, he covers too many movements in each section.  Someone new to tai chi would have great difficulty learning the form from this video, and many of the basics of tai chi are not covered.  On the other hand, someone very skilled in tai chi would pick up the form from the tape just fine.  For someone intermediate, like me, it's a challenge to follow.  Footwork is not explained in the detail that I would like.  A number of movements are combined into each section breakdown causing me to have to rewind the tape over and over.  It would be better if he broke the forms down into more granular movements, which would make it easier to follow and would entail less rewinding to follow the details of the movements.
So my summary:  (1) Beginners - beautiful to watch, inspiring, but you won't learn the small details of tai chi from this video and you will likely not learn these forms from this video (2) Intermediate - a significant challenge and I suggest it's important that you've been schooled in footwork and tai chi basics before hand (3) Advanced - a very nice video for learning Chen style",1038960000,14,1470,4.53030303030303
