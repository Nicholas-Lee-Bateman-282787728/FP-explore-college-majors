8598227,4,B000GALHQA,"This was my second DVD from the series.  I was worried that it would rehash the same ideas from the David Goyer interview I already watched, but Ted Griffin was a completely different kind of writer.  First off, he's really funny.  He cracked jokes from start to finish.  My favorite was his story about getting notes from an agent who never read the script.  It's an entertaining interview but you also get to hear about the writer's process, how he finds inspiration from the classics, how to get a movie made, etc.  Overall, it's a nice mix of entertainment and instruction.  A good buy.",1160092800,2,590,4.615384615384615
