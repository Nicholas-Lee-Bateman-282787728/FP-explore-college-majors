8353286,5,B0026O2Z38,"Yoga for swimmers is a great DVD, it has helped improve my flexibility a ton. I practice it before I go to bed and helps me to relax my muscles. Highly recommend it.",1289606400,2,165,4.03030303030303
8353287,5,B0026O2Z38,"I was very impressed with Won's DVD.  I am a recreational swimmer and dancer and I was excited to try this video to stretch out my tight muscles from my activities.  It was a wonderful experience following Barbara Won's practice.  I literally felt ""taller"" after doing her video.  I have many yoga DVDs and this one is one of the easiest to follow and most relaxing ones I have.  I cannot wait for her next video.",1258156800,3,413,4.381578947368421
8353288,2,B0026O2Z38,"With Yoga for Swimmers, I was hoping for some specific asanas, or some focus asanas for swimming and surfing.  While this video reinforced the asanas we all should be practicing, and in particular the basic shoulder alignments, I was left wanting in the additional asana department.  Barbara Won is a great model, however, as an instructor she provides little physical guide in how or where to feel the pose.  As with much yoga instruction, this falls into the category of ""Simon Says"".  If you are new to yoga, find a good instructor who can teach you the great basic poses Ms. Won presents.  If you are a swimmer, be sure and practice yoga.  A more apt title for this DVD would be Beginning Yoga for Swimmers.",1257638400,6,711,4.603174603174603
