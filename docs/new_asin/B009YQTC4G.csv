8545387,4,B009YQTC4G,"Shortly speaking, this movie represents an original and good twist to the Spaghetti western genre. This film (entitled ""Sugar Colt"" in English viewing countries) was directed in 1967 by Italian director Franco Giraldi. The main story here deals with a northern regiment coming home after the Civil war ended, but that has mysteriously disappeared. Our hero, Rocco (or aka Sugar Colt, played by Jack Betts) learnt about this after a friend played him a visit. The man is killed to be silenced, but manages to ask Sugar Colt to find out what happened to the Yankee regiment. In his way to the area where the soldiers disappeared, Sugar Colt gets to Black Stone where he gets under covered pretending to be a good doctor. There he meets Josephine (played by the beautiful Soledad Miranda and first muse of director Jess Franco). The movie has good action, a good pace, and above all, an original touch where our hero plays an interesting transformation from playing a doctor clown until he reveals him to the bad guys. So, here we have western that mixes mystery, bad guys, a hero playing also his role as detective, and a good amount of shooting.

Technically, this German, Kino Lorber transfer is very good, the norm of this company in my experience. The image comes in widescreen format, with audios in German, Italian and English. Subtitles are in German only. The release comes with several interviews. Be aware that they are in Italian language with forced German subtitles. The movie is a PAL, region 2 DVD that runs for 97 minutes.",1441497600,,1536,4.796226415094339
