8153513,5,B000JW6SM8,"Although I'm not a kettlebell ""expert"", I use them on a weekly basis as part of my regular workouts.  I borrowed this DVD from a friend to use one weekend and found it to be a great workout resource!  I must disagree with the previous review on his assessment of the music.  When going full out on my workouts, I'm pretty much oblivious to any background music.  All the moves were on target and Bellomo knows his stuff and keeps you hopping.  Loved the DVD!",1403136000,,458,4.341176470588235
8153514,2,B000JW6SM8,"As a whole, this DVD is not terrible, the information is decent, the two guys explain the moves well and demonstrate them effectively. What is NOT good about the video is: First and foremost the music is horrendous and very distracting. It would be really nice if you could kill the music altogether. Which brings me to my second gripe: on the menu scene there are two selections: ""begin training"" and ""scene selection"", only the only one you can choose is ""begin training"". The ""scene selection"" selection makes the screen look legit but I could not ""select"" it. That was unfortunate because the two workouts at the end of the DVD can only be found by playing the entire thing from the beginning and fast forwarding; something I am not likely to do. All in all the production value is pretty slim but the two guys mean well, they are sincere and not totally useless. That goes along way in my book. I'd much rather the production value suck and the information be good then the other way around.",1323648000,,996,4.569832402234637
