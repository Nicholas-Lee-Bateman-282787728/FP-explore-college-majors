434620,4,6302149487,"Weekend is an explosive and creative work by the famed Jean-Luc Godard, a story of the apocalypse framed in an Alice in Wonderland-esque format. It follows a middle-class couple as they journey among other refugees, including a man who believes himself God, an isolated barnyard, and ultimately a camp of cannibalistic hippies.

I am not typically shocked by movies, but Weekend had certain elements, both thematic and visual, that were very disturbing. One of the opening scenes features the female protagonist describing a horrific sexual encounter, but with an indifferent tone juxtaposing the bizarre acts she is describing. There is also graphic footage of the killing of animals, which was effective but, in my opinion, unnecessary and cruel.

Weekend is also full of intriguing and engaging philosophical and political debate. There is a memorable moment when two men, an African and an Arab, discuss the exploitation and destruction done unto their people by Western culture. This profound, and unfortunately still-relevant debate, is bookended by consistent allusions to Marx, Rousseau, and other political thinkers.

Considered a cornerstone of French New Wave Cinema, Weekend is an entertaining and very thought-provoking existential look at middle-class culture and how easily one can succumb to terrible acts. Godard's film shows that there is very little separating what we call civilization and the state of nature.",1369440000,,1430,5.490909090909091
434621,2,6302149487,"I read somewhere that Salvador Dali once said to some journalist: ""Do you know why I am so rich? Because there are so many stupid people in the world!"". This is the case with the most of J.L.Godard's ""art"" outcome (which though never comes even close to what the famous spanish artist did). While some of his earlier efforts (A Bout de  Suffle, Mepris, Vivre Sa Vie, Bande a Part) were inovative, interesting and (the most important!) watchable, quite everything what he did after approx. 1966 is boringly pretentious, uninteresting and totally unwatchable crap. The same can be said about ""Weekend"". It's a poor leftist political masturbation mixed with foolish experimenting and cruel exploitation, having nothing to do with art. J.L.Godard should be the last one to complain about bourgeausie in the western world. His luck that he wasn't born in Maoist China or in Stalinist Russia.

`Weed End' is no exception.

Godard frequently used his artistic approach to elaborate on the political dilemmas facing his country at that given time, and the Parisian 60's were a ripe canvas for Godard's superior sense of cinematic vision.  The life of the bourgeois (for an interesting read, check out the Wikipedia page for `bourgeoisie', which will enlighten you on the very culture with which Godard pointed his camera lens) is dissected with brash statements that firmly underscore a point of view towards the political situations they found themselves in, using vivid and ridiculously obscene imagery and dialog to drive home the absurdity of the moment.

One, two, three, four...

The film revolves around a young Parisian couple who is sifting in their own moral callousness, each individual party possessing disturbed ideals and ideas.  The two embark on a dreaded weekend with the wife's parents, where they fantasize about the demise of her father so as to reap the benefits of his will.  Along the way they are bombarded with events out of their control that only serve to further embellish their misplaced priorities.

When their car is engulfed in flames, the cries for the loss of a handbag place a bold exclamation-point at the end of this couples `description'.

The absurdity of the film engulfs itself, really piling one ridiculous moment on top of the other, but all in a way that thrives within the context of the film.  Godard was never a mainstream director, but he also created art pieces that told a story, that elaborated on truths not willingly admitted by those around him.  Godard understood that filmmaking was a gift, a gift to be used as a tool to instill something in others.  In all of his works, he did that very thing.  With exaggerated sequences that uses unending tracking shots to create a feeling of uneasiness in the viewer (the never-ending traffic jam is one of many), Godard splashed visual wizardry on the screen and imprinted his political satire on the minds of the audience.  Some have noted that Godard was a distant or cold director, but I find that aspect of his work endearing, for it sharply places a sense of realism in his wildly imaginative take on reality.  There is nothing within `Week End' that appears real.  In fact, even the protagonists here question their reality.  The sequences (which involve, among other things, murder and cannibalism) all wear the stain of the absurd and yet they feel remarkably `honest' thanks to the `cold' approach that Godard takes.  By stepping away from the characters and the moments and delivering a nonchalant take, he inserts a frigid sense of reality that makes this pill a lot easier to swallow.

434647,4,6302149487,"""Weekend"" (1967) is directed by Jean Luc Godard (Breathless, Pierrot le fou, Le Mepris). This black comedy follows a bourgeois married couple, who both have secret lovers, and who are both planning the others' murder. They set off for her parents' home in the country to secure her inheritance from her dying father. On the way through the picturesque countryside they witness violent car accidents, as well as an assortment of characters, some from literature and history, and others representing the various classes in society. The film is broken up with intertitles that comment on the action as well as on the process of film viewing. Discussions from characters range from notions on identity to class struggle. The two protagonists seem intent on their sole and petty goal of the inheritance despite the fact that most everyone else around them are focused on more grave notions regarding philosophy and the binding relationships between humanity and the disparities between people and their rights and freedoms. This incongruous relationship between the two leads, and those around them, is enhanced by the jarring musical score which often sounds like the dramatic music from a film noire gangster film.

The film also includes some special features, including a commentary by critic David Sterritt, an interview with cinematographer Raoul Coutard, and a Mike Riggis interview about his views on the film.",1337299200,,1413,5.252212389380531
434648,2,6302149487,"After exploding onto the scene and trumpeting the arrival of the French New Wave with Breathless, Godard churned out about a dozen films throughout the 60s, bookending this period of influential French art house cinema with the brutally satirical Weekend in 1967. After that, he stopped making commercial films and instead concentrated entirely on out-there left wing projects that were not meant to make money but to carry his Marxist and existential philosophies to some undefined point beyond the horizon.

Weekend is a bizarre film that is meant to challenge conventional filmmaking in every way possible; the camera consciously creates a distance between the material and the viewers, violating the fundamental laws of camerawork (such as when to shoot close-ups, and at one point the camera tracks down the road a bit, stops on nothing, then tracks back to the main characters in a completely pointless diversion) and often occupying a faraway vantage point that records the nutty action in an ironically detached way. There is no real plot, other than the journey of two completely amoral sociopaths traveling through the French country side and encountering a series of surreal and sometimes fictional characters. Characters often break the fourth wall and at several points one character will ask another if he is in a film or in reality, laying the self-reflexive metafictionality of the narrative on a bit thick.

The movie is, at its core, a sharp criticism of capitalism that bounces some lofty left wing Marxism around in an aggressive but thoroughly uninspiring way. It aims to depict the apathetic malaise that is a pillar of the Western, capitalist way of life, a mode of interacting with the world that emphasizes conflict and exploitation and desensitizing media exposure. On a parallel track, Godard aims to take on cinema and art while attacking capitalism and Western culture. He loves classic Hollywood, that much is obvious, but his success and the success of the French New Wave seem to have convinced him that he was the Messiah of Modernism and so this film's goal is to be the final statement on traditional cinema. The ending self-importantly declares The End... of Cinema. It's a radical smorgasbord, both in the political note it strikes as well as the deconstruction of cinematic techniques.

If a random person had made this film, it would be considered total garbage. But because Godard happened to explode on the scene at the right time and has an enormous index of criticism to back him up, Weekend will forever be beloved by graduate students and other scholarly types who like to engage in abstract debates that have no answer. There are some very intricate tracking shots in this film including the justly famous 10 minute one-shot take on the car accident and the piano scene in the village square, and the ambitiousness of the film is respectable. But in the end it's only interesting as an intellectual game and not, unfortunately, as a movie.",1327276800,8,2985,5.026262626262627

434652,4,6302149487,"WEEK-END

Jean-Luc Godard's WEEK-END is certainly beyond the usual egocentrism of Nouvelle Vague (New Wave) movies. In other terms, while the formers (including his BREATHLESS) deal with personal characteristic themes, WEEK-END is dominated by philosophical, cultural, social, and geopolitical themes. It's a franc satire of the Parisian upper-class but more importantly it's a dark view of the modern civilization's self decay, materialism, apathy, terrorism, and violence. And though the movie has the protagonists -like most nouvelle vague- as ""anti-heroes"", it's more adequately classified as a post-modern work, approaching very similar (if not the same) territories explored mainly by Bergman (movies like Shame, Passion of Anna) and to a lesser width in Antonioni's trilogy in that same era (mid-late 60's). While Bergman approached these themes in a sinister, philosophical (i.e. Bergmanesque) manner, Godard used his usual raw humor adding some surrealistic escapades in a direct tribute to Bunuel (even a section of the movie is titled EXTERMINATING ANGELS).
Symbolism is also a crucial element in this work: Cars -a classical Godard fetish- are all over the place, in all possible states (turned upside down, exploded, dysfunctional...) as a metaphor for ""modernism"", the domination of the three main French national colors (blue/red/white) is obvious...etc

Technically speaking, on a first glimpse, Jean-Luc Godard's WEEKEND may seem like a regular Film Noir centered on an upper-class Parisian couple. The initial scenes have a dark-lighting quality and a remarkable over-use (on purpose) of a very Hollywoodish , overzealous, melodramatic musical score.
One of my favorite scenes in this movie (and even in all of Godard's) is the traffic scene that takes place after fifteen minutes of the start and lasts for good ten minutes. Godard staged the complex scene beautifully; his camera tracks the main car, spans in and out smartly.
Godard's love for experimentation is hard to miss here: characters unrelated to the main narration emerge from different times (the French revolution) break the fourth wall by talking to the camera directly.  A pianist actually playing live -non dubbed- Mozart in a farm. The director interrupts the narration very frequently by projecting titles that play on words and with multi-layered symbolism, he wanted to make it clear that it's only a movie. I personally enjoyed those ""word plays"" initially but half-way through the movie they exceeded my patience, but again maybe it's because I'm aware that I'm dealing with a Godard and usually I'm very impatient when watching his works.

Surprisingly, the US DVD edition (NEW YORKER VIDEO) isn't bad at all, with a very useful audio commentary by critic David Sterritt, an interview with the movie cinematographer Raoul Coutard, and input from director Mike Figgis.

I think WEEK-END is one of the director's best. I enjoyed it more than his other highly- acclaimed works (Alphaville, Contempt, Tout Va Bien, Breathless....), and I recommend it even to whoever is  -like me- not a fan of Godard at all.",1223510400,,3097,5.3884297520661155
434653,5,6302149487,"Don't buy this if you want a ""story""- kind of movie, where everything makes sense. Some things in this movie make sense, some don't, and the story plays a minor role. There is nothing pretentious about it, it's just the kind of movie Godard likes to make. I don't agree with his political statements, but still liked the movie. It is full of interesting ideas, images and music. Compared to Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" (Breathless), ""Weekend"" left a greater impression on me, because it is not just about the main characters, but about society as a whole. The trip into the country of two main characters (with bad intent) turns into a metaphor for the end of civilization. And if I didn't like anything else about it, the actress would still have captured my eye the entire movie. As with most of Godard movies, afterward I wonder: ""Why do I like this?"", and Mike Figgis (extra features on the dvd) puts it in words very well, which I find helpful. The comments also point out some of the things that are otherwise easy to miss.",1212969600,,1030,4.543010752688172
434654,2,6302149487,"It's been 4 decades and viewing the political notions in Weekend had for me the feel of the stale dialogue that comes from aging activists who have built a lifetime's ethos and idealogy constructed around insights and ideas they had when they were 19 years old.  No matter that history may have demonstrated how wrong-headed and downright misinformed they may have been, they remain true believers.  Mind you, I have no idea what Jean Luc Godard believes today, but I believe he was part of that French intellectual class that embraced some, if not all, of the ""revolutionary"" rubbish of the 60's and 70's that passed for brilliance in its day.

This film is a product of the late 60's when intellectual France, much as intellectual America, was being galvanized into action by opposition to the Viet Nam War and by a romantic notion of the Youth Generation as torch bearers for a new age of enlightenment.  Godard distances himself from the nonsense his young revolutionaries spout, so I don't know what part, if any, he embraces or rejects.  Godard specialists can guide you there.

What I see on film, is how tired hot-button political issues become with time and the perspective of history.  Likewise, how utterly mundane what once might have been shocking or ""revolutionary"" becomes with that same time and distance.

I always brace myself when I hear the word ""absurdist"" applied to any work of art.  That term can cover the range of the razor sharp satire of a Voltaire to the inane shenanigans of the Three Stooges.  At least the Stooges are straightforward and un-pretentious.  What we get in a much absurdist art is a lot of muck thrown against a wall to see if any sticks.  But with the pretense!  Artsy fartsy stoogery.

Director Mike Figgis in the extras says Godard's films inspired because they were ""full of ideas"".  Yep.  You will have to judge whether any of them are worth your time to sort out as you follow this meandering tale.

The film starts out well, when after a pornographic monologue (no doubt shocking in 1967) we are introduced to a despicable bourgeois couple, intent on murder of rich relatives and unbeknownst to themselves, each other.  They are vile and amusing, and yes there soon comes the famous endless traffic jam, and it is a nice conceit.  What follows after that, I must confess, increasingly bored and irritated me. An occasional aside or moment was fine, but most of it was about as interesting as having an insurance policy explained, or the subtleties of Gallic political theory.

Godard is an acquired taste apparently.  I have tried.  I find some interest in Breathless, Le Petit Soldad, and several others, but the deep regard some have for his work is lost on me.  He may have broken new ground, no doubt.  But there is a certain French existential ennui that breathes beneath his films that just doesn't appeal to me.  It may be a perfecly valid viewpoint, but it cloys. His embrace of film history while questioning its relevance gets old fast. I must try some of his later works, because what I have sampled from the early stuff seems terribly dated and trivial today.",1189814400,7,3123,4.749536178107607

It's the first movie I've seen by Godard; A director, whose work I've been wanting to see for years because I heard he was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino (my favorite filmmaker). ""Weekend"" seems to take place in a post-Apocalyptic world or Hell; either way, it's a very unique looking movie. The movie features a series of unbroken shots; Including one in the beginning where Corinne explains to her husband Roland about a sexual experience that she had (maybe only in her dreams). This shot (I didn't time it) is completely unbroken and lasts, at least, five minutes. Corinne and Roland are a despicable couple, who are traveling to their parents house. En route, every bizarre thing that you've never though would happen in a movie happens. There's a traffic jam, which is a shot that also seems to never end. There's burning cars...If I've seen a more unique movie than this; I don't remember what it was. The movie is also very funny;

A scene early in the film (where the couple tries to leave, but encounters a demon-child, his screaming mother, and a man with a gun) was hilarious. Despite all these traits, a lot of people won't like this movie. This certainly isn't a movie you're going to watch with the family and some popcorn. I think if you do like this film (or appreciate it) you will have a desire to see it again immediately. The movie is, essentially, told through images that aren't always explained and rarely make sense. Whether this improves upon each viewing is yet to be seen, but I'm definitely intrigued. As I said, I've never seen a Godard film but I already want to see another one. A lot of movies can be called original and unique; this movie TRULY is unique. I haven't seen anything like it and chances are, you haven't either. I don't know if you'll agree with me or not, but this is what a film buff would refer to as ""a cinematic experience.""

A character rambles about the beauty and power of Mozart, but it is impossible for the sonata to hold our attention for ten minutes.  The pianist in the end just blames it on his poor playing.  The tone is too sarchasitic and wacky for me to actually believe that Goddard meant this to be a serious presentation of ideas.

Frankly, I got the feeling that Godard was simply coasting along, simply chucking at the audience the next thing that came into his cluttered head. They can work out some sort of pattern to it for themselves, if they want to be bothered. Is this all surrealism is, in the end? There are two interviews that come with the features. One is with Mike Figgis, who treats us to an esoteric interpretation which can only barely be understood: anything that the viewer might perceive as a flaw in the film is held up as a virtue. This is apparently because the genius Godard is ""distancing"" himself, and the film itself, both from its subject and the viewer. Well, maybe. The other interview is with the photographer. It looks like Godard was in a filthy mood with everybody when he was making the film, especially the producer and the leading actress. The implication was that the producer had forced the genius to use this actress against his wishes. Shades of Mulholland Drive. Some art critics think that a preliminary sketch is better than a finished picture. This may be so, but only sometimes: sometimes a picture can be over-finished, and its freshness destroyed. But there is a happy medium. No matter how surreal the final product, there does need to be an underlying cohesion, if the audience is to be genuinely impressed and feel some sense of satisfaction. I don't think it will wash to argue that the ultimate intention is to dissatisfy. This is an objective which is far too easy to achieve. So capitalism doesn't work: what are you going to put in its place? For the last 2000 years it's been said that democracy is not a good system of government --- it's merely that the other systems are worse.

If you're not an expert on Godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema, I could definitely see a person writing off this movie as ""sheer pretentious crap"", but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance. On the other hand, those who say this is Godard's finest work must be riding high on acid and Marxism themselves. The truth of the matter is that ""Weekend"", like every one of Godard's post-Anna Karina films, is more a flawed experiment than anything else: On occasion, interesting and thought-provoking, but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them. I respect Godard's attempt to create a new cinema built on ""ideas"" rather than ""emotion"", but in my opinion, he went too far in this direction. A piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and don't we have enough of that in our crude, consumerist society? And as far as experiments go, much of what he was doing in ""Weekend"", he had already done and with vastly better results in  ""Pierrot le Fou"". That film was a perfect balance between Godard the political-scientist and Godard the post-modern film-maker. Plus, ""Pierrot le Fou"" benefited by having Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. They brought heart and humor to Godard's abstract explosion of ideas; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor(s) that he never achieved again. ""Weekend"" starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam, leading to a car-crash...but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space. You really wish Belmondo and Karina would pop in and show the cast they don't have to be mere nails to Godard's hammer.",1125532800,25,1870,4.936507936507937

434682,5,6302149487,"WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW

I've not seen all of Jean-Luc Godard's films, but of those I have seen this is my favorite. The narrative concerns a conventional, middle class, married couple who conspire to take a weekend trip to kill the wife's parents for money.

The car trip taken by the couple is comprised of a series of disastrous, improbable, and perplexing events. Art terrorists, thieves, rapists, and Marxist revolutionaries assail the couple at all turns. France is being overrun by weirdos! Bloody, flaming car (and plane!) crashes are everywhere. Violent demise is at every turn.

In the movie is a famous traffic jam scene that employed what was, up until the time of this movie's making, the longest dolly ever made. The scene is absurd, comical, and one of the delights of the movie. Likewise, Godard was becoming interested in socialist politics at this time in his career, in light of the Vietnam war and anti-colonial struggles that were happening globally, so a lot of ""revolutionary"" ideas are expressed by characters in the film. Unfortunately Godard most often has people simply read manifestos to the camera. Godard's political interests are thus conveyed in an awkward, cumbersome way. You do not have to agree with they're saying in order to enjoy the film.

Having said that, the movie is still one hell of a ride -- no pun intended. The bourgeois couple at the heart of the story don't care about the flaming chaos around them. They just want their money. At one point the husband even sits idly by as a stranger rapes his wife.

As a journey narrative of two people, WEEKEND (or is it WEEK END?)is reminiscent of Alejandro Jodorwosky's 1968 FANDO & LIS. (There was something in the water in the late 60s.) Like Fando & Lis, Weekend is mainly a series of segments or vignettes strung together over the course of two protagonists' quest. In Fando & Lis's case the couple's uest is for the fabled City of Tar; in Weekend's case it's for an ample inheritance.

The last 30 minutes are the best in the film, as well as the most graphic. Comparisons to Pasolini's SALO or even John Waters's PINK FLAMINGOS may come to mind. In short, the bourgeois couple are kidnapped by mod-ish looking radical militants who look as if they've all come from an MC5 concert. One disturbing scene shows the actors actually slaughtering a duck and a pig on camera. The ducks headless neck suirts blood as its body twitches and its wings flap. The pig struggles as its throat is slit in front of the camera. Of course, people kill pigs and fowl everyday -- it's how a lot of folks are supplied with their favorite meals. What could possibly be wrong with showing it, Godard almost seems to ask?

But the radicals also, it turns out, like to literally eat the rich, too. One uncomfortable scene portrays a victim stripping naked, being killed, and then being prepared for a meal as a cook cracks two eggs over her lifeless body and then thrusts a fish into her vagina (not shown on camera). Finally, the bourgeois husband is killed and is served up with the pig meat. The wife, who seems to have accepted the militants' way of life at this point, dines on her husband's and the pig's flesh as the movie ends.

Not for everyone, but some sort of remarkable milestone in cinema. Chaotic, dangerous, transgressive, and never boring.

The version of WEEK END I saw was the PAL version, which featured a great transfer, nice lucid colors, and special features that included an interview with Godard cinematographer Raoul Coutard, who is actually quite humorous and likeable as he sheds light on the circumstances surrounding the making of the movie. (""Godard was in a bad mood most of the time he was making the film, hence all the car crashes,"" ""Godard wanted to piss off the producer with this scene,"" etc., to paraphrase.)",1122249600,21,3818,4.7293233082706765
434683,5,6302149487,"Jean-Luc Godard's film Week End is loaded with his obsessions with outrageous characters, political and philosophical ideas, and so on, and many viewers have claimed this to be a full on political film. From what I could gather after seeing a poor yet manageable copy of this film, I saw that this is possibly his best effort in terms of abrasive, surreal though bravura directing. He leaves the camera on his characters, with their flaws almost shining off them (which serves as an asset in some scenes), and yet most of the time it feels like he's directing a comedy of these events- comedy of errors.
Consider the scene where the woman has the monologue in her panties and bra, how she leads up such telling, informatory details to a payoff that gives as a reminder of the Walken scene in Pulp Fiction (though he is the better actor). Or in other times the comedy is in the sense of a Godard satire of his past work - the traffic set piece(s) gets the viewer to feel in the mood of the car he so pacingly follows, even as it becomes relentlessly obnoxious and tense, and acts like every other driver on the streets of the cities of America.
However that, and a moment of argument over a corpse in the passenger seat (he cuts to the faces of the onlookers who happen to find such dialogue rather amusing), show by the time Godard reached this stage in his career he wasn't taking himself and his work 100 % seriously, though that's not to say that the element of the woman's path to guerilla-hood isn't a serious topic. For his art film die-hards he also uses a peculiar, non-linear style in story-telling- an added advantage for a week-end timepiece.
I'm reminded of Fellini (as I was while watching another Godard film of recent, Contempt) in one aspect of the picture, in terms of how he portrays his women- he can love them, ignore them, belittle them, or even glorify them in the most drastic of measures, but he can't control them. One also wonders if this is how he just makes it for his films, or if in real life the women of his life were really this (how do I put it) out-there.
The script occasionally veers off on it's tale of a couple going on a disastrous week-end out for stretches of poetry, discussion, things that don't have much to do with the story, and yet there's a catching, eccentric, melodic aura to these scenes and passages. These kinds of scenes make it perfectly clear that Godard has created an original work here, one that may put off audience members who ""don't get it"" or expect total sense in the outcomes. Certainly a movie made for it's time, country of origin, and target group.
To sum up my review let me put it this way - this is the kind of picture that would've heavily influenced The Doors.",1073692800,17,2734,4.47

434685,5,6302149487,"With influences ranging from Freud to Marx, De Sade and Eisenstein having walk-on roles and the Parisian weekend transformed into an allegorical bourgeois hell,
Week-End is one of the defining films of the 20th Century. Born out of the nouvelle vague cinema (French New Wave), this is the terrible birth that is brought to light from J.L.Godard's obsession with prophesising the destruction and decline of the West. Even after taking into account his overt political messages, Weekend still exist as one of the most technically revolutionary pieces of cinema to emerge from his studios into a blinding glare of publicity and hostility.
Not content with depicting the destruction of western commercial values, Godard disrupts the visual narrative by interspersing film titles, book titles and music onto a background of patriotic red, white and blue colours. From a personal perspective, one of the most impressive sequences is an eight minute long tracking-shot of the Parisian highway which progresses from straightforward traffic jams to car-wrecks and the inevitable symbol of multinational Capitalism, a Shell oil truck. Essentially Week-End marks the 'Maoist period' of Godard's film-making career, during which he declared that 'the only way to be a revolutionary intellectual is to give up being an intellectual.'
Starring Mireille Darc and Jean Yanne, Week-End's fabular narrative is a weekend journey from Paris to Normandy which slowly becomes an apocalyptic struggle against the French peasant revolutionaries who continually intervene to prevent the couple meeting Darc's mother in order to find out whether they have successfully poisoned her father. This emblematic quest for the Capitalist Grail is hindered by a philosophising character from Dumas, two rebels (African and Algerian) masquerading as refuse collectors and Saint-Juste, before the couple are captured on their return to Paris by the Seine-et-Loise Liberation Front, a group of cannibalistic freedom fighters.
Godard's continued affinity with politics can be witnessed in his other Maoist films, Les Chinoise (1967), Le Gai Savoir and Tout Va Bien (1972). Despite accusations of pretension, he still remains one of the most provocative and influential film makers of his and future generations, whilst his immense cinematic output can be regarded as a Marxist biography of the previous century.
What was an initially ground-breaking piece of cinema has evolved into an essential European film. Heralded by Pauline Kael in the New Yorker as 'Godard's Vision of Hell, and it ranks with the visions of the greatest' and 'somewhere between Swift and Samuel Beckett, alternatively violent and tender, humorous and cruel' (Jan Dawson, Sight and Sound) Week-end is a film that must be seen to be believed and to miss this is to miss out on one of the spectacles of 20th Century cinema.",1019001600,19,2857,5.408071748878924
434686,1,6302149487,"I personally feel, there are two ways to judge movies. And to determine if they are good or not. The first way, and I think the best way is to judge the quality of the film. Is the directing first rate? Is the screenplay smart and witty? Does it make sense? How is the acting? Do the actors turn in good performances? Are they're characters of the viewer to relate to? Is there some sort of human condition where we feel sorry for the characters? And, if all of this falls into place then I feel you have a wonderful movie. The second way to judge a movie would be to determine if it's simply enjoyable. If it's a guilty pleasure. If your in the mood of lets say some stupid funny comedy. And don't care if the movie is well made, but, as long as it has laughs in it then you should buy or rent that movie. Is the person getting what they wanted out of a certain movie? I don't care if it's ""Austin Powers"", ""Charlie's Angels"", or some teen comedy. I'm not here to rate people's taste. Now, in knowing what I just said before, about judging a movie, I honestly feel ""Weekend"" fails in both groups. Many people love movies because it makes them think of when they were younger. It brings back memories. And, perhaps that's the case with this Godard film. I wasn't born in the 60's but maybe so many people like this film because it reflects what was going on in the country at that time. And, if that's the case fine. But, if someone likes the movie for that reason, if you watch it now, that appeal it once had, I feel is now gone. ""Weekend"" from what I understand after reading the back of the cover was suppose to be Godard making some sort of satire about what has happened to society. He takes the ""disjointed"" ways of life and applies that ""craziness"" to the road. There a scene that goes on for about 10 minutes (I could be wrong. I didn't time the scene) where all you see is a long line of traffic. As the two main charaters; Corinne (Mireille Darc) and Roland (Jean Yanne) drive along side trying to get past the traffic. This is considered a ""land mark"" scene. Godard to me, is just a little bit over the line to the point where he hits being pretenious. Godard has made other films where he trys to examine society. Right now I'm thinking about ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her"". But was the metaphor of traffic such a great one to express the social relevancy of the times? If you switch over to Italian cimema and watch Visconti's films, he too, dealt with the down side of society. About how the higher class seems to be no better than the lower class. Watch films like ""The Innocent"", ""Ludwig"", or ""The Leopard"". Visconti used much better metaphors to express his ideas. Fammed Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman was once quoted as saying he hates, he actually used to word hate. He hates Godard's films. He went on to say that he gets the feeling that Godard wants to say something important. but leaves you hanging for more. Sometimes I agree with that statement. There's a scene where a black worker (I'm sorry but I don't seem to remember the name of the character or who played him) and a french worker. They are each describing the ""problems"" the other ethnic group has or had to face. Now, I don't know, maybe when this was first released. People were taken with this. Maybe Godard didn't have to go all the way with the speech. Maybe people just seemed to completely understand what he was talking about. But, their words to me, are just a bunch of words that never amount to meaningful sentences. He's trying to say something important, but, doesn't go all the way. I really don't think this film is worth watching. Many times durning the movie I found I was getting bored. But I stuck with the movie. The movie just doesn't work. If people would just put aside their admiration for Godard for one second. Clear their eyes watch the movie, and please try to keep in mind what I said. Maybe, just maybe, some people might admit, I have a case to be made. Maybe a small case, but still a case.",987552000,9,4018,4.3515312916111855
7822179,5,6302149487,"As the 1960s went on Jean-Luc Godard kept up the kind of brash, zany, experimental style with which he made his name and became a cornerstone of the French New Wave, but his work increasingly showed a political consciousness sparked by the explosion of the consumer society in that decade. The class of haves, in his view, were being increasingly selfish and dog-eat-dog, while the have-nots of the world could not be expected to stand by idly. Society was surely headed for a breakdown, and his 1967 film WEEKEND is an absurdist vision of it in one hour and forty-five minutes. This is emphatically *not* a good entry point to Godard -- if you don't know his work, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breathless/dp/B01KGR17ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breathless</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Mepris/dp/B002ZG4Q66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Mepris</a>&nbsp;first -- but it is a marvelous capstone to his first decade of cinema. (After this, Godard disappeared from the limelight for some years while making more overtly political films with Jean-Pierre Gorin as the Dziga Vertov collective.)

Married couple Roland (Jean Yanne) and Corinne (Mireille Darc) set off from Paris one weekend for Corinne's parents' home, as her father is dying and they want to make sure they get their cut of inheritance. Not only is their relationship with Corinne's parents focused solely on money, but both Roland and Corinne are secretly having affairs and each plans to later dispose of the other in order to run away with their lovers. As Roland and Corinne hit the road, civilization appears to have vanished all around them: people are violently fighting each other over petty arguments, the road out of Paris is an endless traffic jam of honking horns and yelling, and the roadside is littered with car wrecks and their bloody victims.

WEEKEND is a grand portrait of human veniality like Dante's INFERNO. Even when Corinne and Roland encounter a group of hippies, the idealistic dreamers who oppose the cruel order of capitalist society, they are shown great cruelty. Godard was awfully prescient: not only did he shoot this film a year before the events of May 1968 and he presaged a youth revolt, but he also expected that youth to perpetuate the same flaws of the system they overthrew.

Visually, WEEKEND is as much a delight as any of Godard's other colour films of this time, with a pop art feel. Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard had a great eye for colour, mainly the red, white, and blue from the French flag, but all the hues on screen are bold and electric. A great treat for film aficionados are several long tracking shots that required great skill to shoot, such as the long traffic jam. There's a lot of poetry in the shots: I don't know why, but a long take where a pianist plays a Mozart suite to a crowd of farmers in a barnyard and Anne Wiazemsky (in a non-speaking role) walks up to listen, is as emotionally moving to me as anything from Tarkovsky.

By this point Godard's films assume that the viewer is an intellectual, someone who has read a good bit of the literary canon and is aware of the political disputes not only of our time but also those reaching back to the 18th century. Thus as Corinne and Roland are wandering around lost around their own eventual car wreck, they come across the historical personage Saint-Just from the French Revolution (one of two amusing roles played here by the legendary Jean-Pierre Laud), who absurdistly declaims from his writings while decked out in period costume. They then meet Tom Thumb and Emily Bront. As the climax of the film approaches, two representatives of the Third World, African and Arab dustmen that our protagonists hitch a ride from, recite a revolutionary Marxist text at some length. And one scene where Corinne recounts a sexual encounter to her lover is a parody of Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA, which had come out the previous year.

Criterion's re-release of WEEKEND on Blu-ray is a welcome event. The pop-art canvas of Godard's 1960s colour films comes through better in this higher-resolution format than on the old DVD releases. Criterion's extras are also enjoyable and informative. Viewers without a prior grounding in Godard's literary/political/social context will appreciate a 20-minute visual essay by Kent Jones which explains most of the references in the film, as well as some contemporary developments in Godard's life that aren't directly shown in the film, but made it what it is. There are interviews with the main actors from French television just before the film's 1968 release, and they explain how great it was to work with Godard, though one realizes that they hadn't seen the finished film and might well have been appalled at its anarchic pace and agitprop. The role of ""making of"" featurettes is provided by relatively recent interviews with cinematographer Raoul Coutard and assistant director Claude Miller.",1479081600,,5026,5.184729064039409
7822180,4,6302149487,"Godard, just a few years after his remarkable Alphaville, produced 1967's Weekend, which may be a political film, and is certainly surreal.  It opens with a vicious young couple who, we quickly find, would like not only their parents dead (for the money and estate) but each other as well.  Below, a fight breaks out in the apartment house's lot over a parking space.  A man, outraged by losing a space, attacks the first driver, chased by a young woman throwing what look like academic or legal papers at the main assailant.  (Godard was never subtle).  The first driver falls, possibly dead, and the young woman gets into the assailant's car and departs.  After a highly charged, but oddly sexless, discussion about sex, the not- quite-protagonist couple rushes off to the French countryside in a sports car, chased by gunshots from a neighbor.  The world Godard sees is clearly disturbed!  Then begins one of the longest tracking shots in cinema, a twenty minute traffic jam littered with overturned vehicles, bodies, and a variety of characters who use the spare time to play games, argue with the couple as they sneak by in the wrong lane, or picnic.  That's recognizable part of Godard's world in Weekend.  It's followed by a surreal journey into ghastly automobile accidents, terrorism, ghosts with bizarre commentaries, barbarism, and, finally cannibalism  -- the eating attended by political discussions.  There's a message of course, that the capitalist world is nothing but endless competition ending in pointless death and massive damage to property and to nature itself.  But does Godard mean that?  Or, as in Alphaville, is he practicing a form of cinematic play?  This writer never much believed Godard's politics were anything but a front for playing with the big toy called cinema.  As is the case with boutique radicals, credentials are deployed to allay criticism for hypocrisy or -- heaven help us -- having fun.  Godard clearly had a blast making this one.

The only interesting thing in ""Weekend"" is the long shot of the traffic jam.  The rest of it, well, I know that Godard was anti-technique and high concept, but it seems that a lot of this film suffers from self-conscious, badly executed moments--moments when the viewer says, ""Okay, I get it, the actors are referring to the fact they're in a film, and the film's referring to the fact it's a film"", but it's so flat and contrived that you wonder why the idea was expressed in a film rather than an essay.  This becomes especially true toward the end, when dialogue gives way to readings of political manifestos. I would think that films would be able to express things that words don't, but here we just have people in front of a camera reading something we could as easily read ourselves.
