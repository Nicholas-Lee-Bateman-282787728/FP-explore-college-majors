2562041,5,B000FEBWSK,"We love Lazy town in this family.  It used to be on regular rotation here, but now  is only available on the Spanish networks.  That said, we had to buy the videos if we wanted to view the show.  A bit cheesy, but my kids think Sportacus is the ""man"".  Robbie Rotten is a fantastic actor. Has a 90's techno music soundtrack that Daddy jams to.",1310601600,,343,4.136363636363637
2562042,5,B000FEBWSK,"Both my son and daughter can agree on this show!  My son loves to watch it and then go out to play soccer like Sportacus.  I wish it was still on TV, but this is fine, too.  It also plays over and over again so that when we come inside again (after having forgotten to turn it off in the haste to go outside) it's still going! My daughter wants to be like Stephanie and likes to call apples ""sports candy."" Won't NickJr bring it back?",1301184000,,434,4.023255813953488
2562043,5,B000FEBWSK,"We love Lazy Town and this is another great DVD - our kids all love to watch it (ages 3, 7 and 10).  Our boy pretends that he's Sportacis and our girls pretend they are Stephanie.  Great messages and wholesome values.  Highly recommend.",1289865600,,236,4.441860465116279
2562044,5,B000FEBWSK,"LazyTown is a bit different.  But my son loves Sporticus, and wants to emulate him.  One day I found him turning flips in his room as he tossed his toys in the toy chest.  When he was done he said ""Look, Mom!  I cleaned my room like Sporticus!""  That was worth the price of this video!!!",1285459200,,287,4.053571428571429
2562045,5,B000FEBWSK,"This is a delightful and entertaining film.  The story and characters are more developed than the versions my grandson and I have seen on television.  Robbie Rotten is really rotten, and chidren are taught a valuable lesson about being lazy.",1284768000,,241,5.0
2562046,5,B000FEBWSK,"Sportacus and Stephanie:
sports candy = fruits and vegetables (better than ""real food"" which is what we called these two before)
junk food or healthy food: the prince and princess toss out this query before we eat anything
""let's go play and exercise first"" = anything that encourages mine to say this gets two thumbs up from me
Such a wonderful show with a nice Icelandic touch. How can we go wrong?",1235692800,,400,4.569444444444445
2562047,5,B000FEBWSK,"It didn't really matter to us which episode, just something that can be watched in the car, not just at home.  But Records Day is actually quite cute.  Everyone gets up & gets active to try to set new records.  Robbie Rotten is there to stop it, of course.  Our whole family has laughed along with this one.",1214956800,,307,4.241379310344827
2562048,4,B000FEBWSK,"The LazyTown television series is growing in popularity every day, and there's no prize for guessing why.  Originating from Iceland and led from the front by creator and star Magnus Scheving, the show encourages healthy eating and exercise, to the beat of hot Eurodance music.  Part live action, part puppets and some CGI animation, this appealing series also stars one of the most loveable of villains, played by the talented Stefan Karl Steffanson, a hottie with a strong jaw line, an impressive wardrobe of costumes and a never ending stream of nefarious gadgets.

This is the fifth DVD release, and contains four episodes from Season One (2004 - 2005):

Records Day (Episode 18): There's an opening in the LazyTown Records Book for ""Laziest Person"" and Robbie is looking forward to having his name entered for posterity as the record holder in this category.  Unfortunately, Stephanie and the other kids also have their eyes on various records, and a villain's gotta do what a villain's gotta do to put a stop to all the activity.

Hero For a day (Episode 7): Ziggy wants to be a hero like Sportacus, but of course things don't work out as planned for the candy addicted lad.

Zap It! (Episode 17): Lazy Pixel hates cleaning, so he invents a machine that makes things disappear, especially the garbage in an untidy room.  Robbie sees an ideal opportunity to get rid of Sportacus forever. (Insert diabolical laughter and a little dance jig here)

Secret Agent Zero (Episode 27): Move over Mayor Milford Meanswell, because there's a new mayor in town. Suspecting that the election has been rigged, the kids go undercover with Mayor Meanswell to reveal the truth behind the ballot.

The special features are disappointing, with only two short exercise dances that are impossible to follow, and there are no subtitles or closed captioning. It can however be played in French - oooh la la!

2562049,5,B000FEBWSK,"My granddaughters adore this show!  Which is good for this grandma because Robbie Rotten is one of the coolest characters on TV.  The actor who plays him is amazing--versatile, creative, expressive and the most charming bad guy you've ever seen.  It's worth watching the show for him alone.  But Sportacus is beyond amazing.  Watching him spin and jump and leap--it makes me want to get up and get going!  Best of all--his movements are all real--nothing is computer generated--except the background. Stephanie is a very sweet and charming character as well. The puppets are life-sized, funky and fun.  We have the music CD in my car and in their parents' car and my granddaughters are actually learning to sing not just sing-a-long.  Even their parents enjoy the music and we all have confessed to listening to it without the little ones! I can't recommend this show enough. It is one of the most charming shows on TV.  Lazy Town and the Wiggles and I'm one happy grandma with two very happy granddaughters!",1154822400,6,1008,4.813953488372093
2562050,5,B000FEBWSK,"This is an amazing kids' show.  Any show that gets kids excited about eating healthy and being active is one that deserves a lot of praise.  It is very well done.  The costumes, sets, and yes, even the storylines, are all great.  Each episode also includes at least three highly energetic songs (including the theme song and closing song).  And it's not just a show for the kiddies.  I'm addicted to it, and I'm a nineteen year old college student with no kids or younger siblings.  Yeah, I just watch it because I like it :-)  The enthusiasm of the main character, the superhero Sportacus, proclaiming the merits of a healthy lifestyle are even helping ME become healthier.  (Although I still don't exercise as much as I should.)  The ""villain,"" Robbie Rotten, is the funniest guy ever (and basically the main reason for my love of the show).  Stephanie, the girl in pink, is adorable as well.  The rest of the characters are puppets, some more loveable than others...

This show is worth every penny and every minute spent on it.",1150675200,9,1031,4.629834254143646
