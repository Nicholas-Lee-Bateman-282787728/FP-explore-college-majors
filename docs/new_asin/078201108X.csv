7789956,4,078201108X,"""The John Wayne Collection, Vol. 2"" offers three Republic features over a nine-year span, during Duke's rise to major stardom, in the 1940s. While none could be called 'classic', each film is exciting, funny, and eminently watchable...and at a very reasonable price, to boot!

""Dark Command"" (1940): After the spectacular success of Wayne in ""Stagecoach"", Republic realized they actually had an 'A'-list star...still making 'B' movies! While Duke was on loan to RKO for ""Allegheny Uprising"", the studio worked on creating their first 'major' western, borrowing MGM's Walter Pidgeon, top Warner director Raoul Walsh (who'd helmed Wayne's failed initial 'starring' role, ""The Big Trail"", ten years earlier), Claire Trevor (in what would be her third teaming with Wayne in two years), rising star Roy Rogers (who'd inherited the ""Singing Cowboy"" roles a dubbed Wayne had played in the thirties), and ever-popular Gabby Hayes (a frequent Wayne co-star for nearly a decade).

The result of all the assembled talent was a well-crafted, if still modestly-budgeted film, showcasing Duke's charisma and 'star' quality. As an illiterate but straight-talking Texan in Lawrence, Kansas, Duke wins the hearts of the townspeople and banker's daughter Trevor, over schoolteacher William Cantrell (Pidgeon, playing a variation of infamous Southern  guerrilla fighter William Quantrell). With the beginning of the Civil War, Cantrell, showing signs of insanity, recruits an 'army' of mercenaries, dons a stolen Rebel uniform, and burns and pillages, with Duke in pursuit, climaxing in a last-ditch defense of Lawrence.

While very 'fast and loose', historically, ""Dark Command"" is great fun, and the Wayne/Trevor chemistry was never better!

""In Old California"" (1942): Very much in the 'B'-picture mold, but a very entertaining Western of young Boston druggist Wayne relocating to Sacramento (echoing his real-life father's journey from Iowa to California, as a pharmacist), where his modern ideas and integrity (and the attention from saloon girl Binnie Barnes) puts him at odds with 'town boss' Albert Dekker. While fundamentally a pacifist (Wayne diffuses potential confrontations with an ability to bend coins in his fingers!), Dekker, seeing him as a threat, decides to eliminate him by switching medicine with poison, discrediting him...but Wayne would soon have an opportunity to redeem himself...

The film benefits from the comic talents of two of Hollywood's best comedians, Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly, the byplay between Wayne and Barnes, and his confrontations with Dekker (one of the 1940s' best 'villains').

One of Wayne's more 'offbeat' oaters, but still a fan favorite!

""The Fighting Kentuckian"" (1949): Wayne's second effort as star/producer (after ""Angel and the Badman"", in 1947), this is a VERY enjoyable tale, set in 1818 Alabama, of coonskin-capped Wayne, part of the Kentucky militia, falling for French immigrant Vera Ralston (in her second film with Duke), and discovering a plot to swindle the French community (composed of ex-officers of Napoleon, and their families) out of their land, by aristocrat John Howard and ruthless river boss Grant Withers.

What truly makes this film 'special' is Wayne's sidekick, portrayed by the legendary Oliver Hardy, of 'Laurel and Hardy' fame. Hardy, while a friend of Wayne, had only worked 'solo' once in a film in over twenty years (1939's ""Zenobia""), and it took a LOT of coaxing (and Stan Laurel's 'blessing'), to get him to accept the role...and what a pleasure he is, to watch! Wayne and Hardy have a rich chemistry, and the rotund comedian, with his infectious smile and Georgia drawl, makes even minor scenes (like swapping recipes with Ralston's mother) a joy.

With a first-rate supporting cast including Philip Dorn, Hugo Haas, Wayne 'regulars' Paul Fix, Jack Pennick, and Hank Worden, and Marie Windsor (who looks eerily like John Howard, in my opinion!), ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" is, despite the 'pans' you'll see in some of the reviews, one of my favorite John Wayne films...He was never more charming than you'll find him, here!

Three pretty good additions for your 'Duke' library, to be sure!",1156291200,2,4163,5.369631901840491
7789957,3,078201108X,"Dark Command & In Old Calafornia are very good John Wayne westerns, with good scripts and good acting.  Dark Command especially is an outstanding period action piece about pre-civil war conflicts in Kansas.  In Old California sees the Duke as a Druggist (which was his Dad's  profession).  Good comedy & action.  However, including The Fighting  Kentuckian in this set was a mistake.  Not only is the transfer in poor  condition, but the plot is beyond silly.  Dialog, acting, and the script  sink this movie well before the opening credits roll.  There were so many  better movies the Duke made for Repulic in the 40's...it is a shame any of  those weren't included instead.  But like I said, the set is worth the  price for Dark Command & In Old California.",956361600,2,759,4.730769230769231
