7845057,4,630332617X,"This film, to my knowledge, has never been released on DVD, which is unfortunate because more people should have the opportunity to see it and purchase it, particularly as it is a rarity to see Will Patton in a lead role.  The character that he plays in this film, Jack Travers, is complex and flawed - he's torn between his dedication to his craft as a renegade journalist who is willing to go to great lengths to get the information he wants and his desire to be a family man with a wife and a young daughter.  As the story progresses, he is forced to confront the fallout that occurs in both his professional life and his family life when he severely compromises himself as his feelings toward his subject, convicted killer and Death Row inmate Darryl Weston (Michael DeLuise), change and the line between ""professional"" and ""friend"" becomes blurred.  This film clearly illustrates how easy it can be for ethics violations to occur in a variety of settings. There is a quite a bit of implausibility in the prison visitation scenes and in the unfettered access that Travers has to Darryl Weston, but this is otherwise a very good film that shows the complexities involved in pursuing a passion, making sacrifices, and knowing where to draw the line.",1373414400,2,1251,4.703196347031963
7845058,5,630332617X,"I purchased ""Midnight Edition"" simply because of Will Patton.  The movie doesn't disappoint.  Will shines as a leading man, and I have often wondered why he doesn't get more starring roles.  He is a great actor (and very good to look at). This is a sharp suspense drama, with not-really-a-surprise ending, but the acting kept me interested.  Michael DeLuise gives a fine performance for someone so young.  Why hadn't I seen this before??  Nonetheless, I will be seeing it again, and again...",1280102400,4,491,4.926829268292683
