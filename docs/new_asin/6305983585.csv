1107040,3,6305983585,"In ""The Alibi"" starring Dean Cain and Eric Roberts, Dean Cain plays,Bob, a young corporate up and comer who plays basket ball with his brother and childhood friends every Sunday.  This all changes when he meets Camile, played by Lexa Doig.  In Camile, Bob has suddenly found true love.  But Camile has a secret and that secret involves the unexpected death of Bob's brother.  As Bob and Camile try to grow in their love, Bob also tries to solve the murder of his brother.  The two quests are at ends as Bob cannot rest until he knows what has happened to his brother and that knowledge will destroy what he has found with Camile.  I found the plot and development of the story intreging.  Dean Cain does a great job as Bob, showing a wide range of emotions and determination.  Eric Roberts is a great villian - I really hated him in the end.  Lexa Doig is more limited in her range of emotions but is convincing in her part.  My biggest disappointment with the film was that it was not long enough.  It skipped several time frames (as in the scene where they are discussing Christmas presents and the next scene is New Year's Eve) which gave it a disjointed feel and at 90 minutes in length, it could certainly have had smoother transitions.  Overall, I enjoyed the film and am glad I purchased it.",969926400,25,1298,4.453389830508475

7899198,3,6305983585,"Story of some suspect characters. You have to figure out just how evil the woman is and what the two men are thinking. Lexa Doig is pretty good as Camille. She's a fine looking lady as well. This is one of those marginal movies, you may end up liking more than I did or you won't like it at all. Your mileage may vary.",1444867200,,318,3.984375

7899200,2,6305983585,This should have been rated X for nude sex and very dirty movie.  The story would have been great except for the blatant sex.  It's hard to enjoy a movie with such suggestive content and actions.  I'm surprised Dean Cain did this one.  He must have been desperate for money.,1364774400,,274,4.42
7899201,5,6305983585,Eric Roberts and Dean Cain go well together and Lexa Doig is so fine. Wish she was in more movies.,1359331200,,98,3.95
7899202,5,6305983585,"I bought this video because Lexa Doig is in it and has a topless scene. I have liked her ever since I first saw her in Andromeda with Kevin Sorbo. I am familiar with Dean Cain from his Lois and Clark show and his being in this movie is a bonus. Lexa was the main attraction for me.

This starts off as the typical man meets a pretty girl kind of movie and then turns into some kind of dark story about what a man will do for a woman that he loves. I will not give away any more of the plot than that. The ending of this movie is not easy to see coming. It surprised me a little.

7899203,5,6305983585,Exactly as ordered.  I've watched this movie before and admit it it truly a B movie with some predictable moments but the characters execute their roles perfectly.  I loved it.,1309824000,,176,4.833333333333333
7899204,3,6305983585,"An uneven movie in places, things do fit together better during a second or even a third viewing but the show seems to have scenes missing, especially at the end where Dean Cain says, ""That was the deal"".  What ""deal"" he is referring to is uncertain, I don't remember a scene where there was a ""deal"".  Dean enters an elevator with an attractive oriental woman  (a woman conceived during the Vietnam War, who is supposedly half American). They become acquainted, start dating and fall in love.  But later you realize their meeting was not by chance.  She is helping her one time love interest (Eric Roberts)track down the man who unknowingly stole 2.5 million dollars tucked away inside 12 video recorder machines.  Cain's brother (Phil) is the one they're after though, which they realize later.  He borrowed Cain's car to do the heist.  Roberts got the license number as the car screeched away.  Robert's would make a great detective.  He's always showing up in places that would seem unlikely for him to be.  Lexa (Cain's wife) tells Cain ""I do love you"", as she attempts to betray him, but Cain has figured the story out by this time and will not become Robert's next victim.  Not a great movie but a good show to watch late on Friday or Saturday night.",1166572800,,1257,4.638009049773756
7899205,3,6305983585,"Interesting movie.  Not sure I liked the ending.  Good love story but, the girl in this movie ticked me off a lot.  When you have someone like Dean Cain as your lover.  DO NOT GO FOR THE BROTHER.  Dumb.  DO NOT HOLD A GUN WITHOUT GLOVES.  Really dumb.  DO NOT LIE TO YOUR HUSBAND.  Really really dumb.  It always comes back to bite you.  DO NOT LISTEN TO A SINGLE WORD A KILLER HAS TO SAY.  Ingredibly dumb.  Especially a killer who has the gun which killed your husband's brother with your fingerprints on it.  Could have been better.",1123027200,2,535,4.2727272727272725
7899206,3,6305983585,"The DVD isn't in widescreen format, which is always disconcerting.  However, the film itself is uneven.  The main performances are all good, with a particularly fine performance by Dean Cain in the lead as a man who's obsessed with finding out who killed his brother and why, then has to deal with the fact his own wife was involved.  Eric Roberts is fine playing a man who's gone over the edge (a type he's done in the past).  He's not playing a man you love to hate, but just a man you hate.  The female lead gives an effective performance in a two-dimensional role, but it's an impossible role to play, like being cast as Helen of Troy or some other legendary beauty - you can't win.  Literally every lead male character in the film falls for her, and since all three guys are so different in type you can't figure they'd fall for the same type of woman, so what makes this one so special?  That kind of conceit in a film is trying to force a viewer to suspend disbelief.  It doesn't work, neither does the fact she's apparently not too bright, because the first half of the film is so implausible she should have seen it all coming.  By the final half of the film, however, the plot becomes tighter, more tense, and this leads to a satisfactory finish.  Worth watching for the acting, and how it all ends.",986774400,13,1309,4.371900826446281
