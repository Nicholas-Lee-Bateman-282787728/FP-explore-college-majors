Repomen is a good movie and entertaining but might not be for everyone, worth giving it a try at any rate though.",1436313600,,271,4.333333333333333

5696245,4,B00C7MW5JS,"This is an odd pairing of dystopian sci-fi movies.

""Children of Men"" is a five-star adaptation by Spanish director Alfonso Cuaron of the novel by English writer P.D. James. It presents a grim, haunting future in which human beings have ceased to produce children and society has descended into a state of hopelessness and lawlessness. Amid this crisis, a woman becomes pregnant, and she must be taken through a violent no-man's-land to a place of refuge where mankind may be rescued from its infertility. There is both action and humanity in this story, which causes the viewer to both fear and care for its characters. The actors, led by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Clare-Hope Ashitey, are all brilliant.

On the other hand, ""Repo Men"" (not to be confused with the hilarious 1984 film ""Repo Man"") is a two-star movie at best, a big, dumb clich that wastes fine actors -- Jude Law, Forest Whitaker, Liev Schreiber, and Alice Braga -- on one-dimensional characters. The gruesome story concerns a future in which people are charged extortionate prices for replacement organs, which are then ""reposessed"" when the buyer can't make payments. It blatantly steals elements from much better films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Brazil.""

Both of the Blu-rays in this compact case contain plentiful extras including director commentary, numerous featurettes, and deleted scenes. Since this set is being offered at the same low price as the single-disc edition of ""Children of Men,"" I give it four stars, deducting one for the fact that viewers will be tempted to waste their time on the second disc.",1423785600,6,1605,5.026315789473684
