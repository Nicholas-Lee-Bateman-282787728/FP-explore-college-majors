It is one thing to present information but another to make it interesting during the presentation and coherent as opposed to a bunch of sound bites that are out of chronological order.

There is so much information that you will need to repeat the viewing. Then you will need to restrain you self from going out and getting a Theremin kit

Leon Theremin invented the electronic sound machine. This story begins with the voice of an old man speaking with a slight accent. Clara Rockmore was a Theremin virtuoso. This machine creates sounds or tones via an electronic machine that is played by positioning hands near its antennae. One hand controls pitch, the other for volume. People talk about events from the 1920s and 1930s; a concert in Carnegie Hall used many Theremin machines at the same time. The use of sensing devices had other applications. The sound of a Theremin can be compared to a single string cello or violin. Soviet operatives abducted Theremin from New York city in the late 1930s. Tourists from America found him in Moscow in the early 1980s; they met in a subway station.

Theremin worked on a `buran' or bug to listen to conversations. Stalin awarded him a prize. Robert Moog began producing theremins commercially. Theremin discovered his sound effect while working on a radio (like feedback). Moog used this machine to create his synthesizer, which had an effect on popular music. The `Beach Boys' were early adaptors and used it in their hit song ""Good Vibrations"". [The appeal of a novel sound.] Theremin received an award from Stanford University in 1991. We see Clara Rockmore greeting Leon in the 1980s and playing an RCA Theremin in her apartment. Later they walk the sidewalks of New York. Lev Termen died in Moscow on November 3, 1993.
