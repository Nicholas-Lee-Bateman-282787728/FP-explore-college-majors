8530906,5,B008VIM2OK,"PLOT: 4 HOURS OF video of Hitler's... Berchtesgarden and the Eagles Nest in Germany

PART ONE: THE EARLY YEARS....shows the rise of Hitler and the building of the Berghof and his inner circle including Goering, Speer and Bohrmann. Including the actual homes being built. Some color video and interesting back ground on the actual plans for the homes. INCLUDED is the Eagles Nest.

PART TWO: EUROPE FACES THE REICH: home movies of Goring and his family, also lots of color movies of Eva Braun Hitler's mistress and Hitler's ""inner circle"" on terrace and in the Berghof. Also some interviews from his SS bodyguard and Albert Speer.

PART THREE: THE SECOND WORLD WAR~ some rarely seen footage of the road leading up to World War 2 from the Nazi side including invasion of Poland, The Western Front and Invasion of Russia. Some very good detailed info on Rudol Hess who flew to England to make peace with the English.

PART FOUR: END OF THE REICH~ Film of the marriage of Gretel Braun (Eva Braun's sister) in the Eagle's Nest. this is in Color and very rarely seen. And video of the last year of the War from video of inside Germany. INCLUDED are some video of the bombed out Berghof and information on it AFTER the war and why the Americans finally blew it up in 1952 to avoid it being a ""shrine"" for the Nazis.

this was first released in 1987 and was only available on VHS. Glad they finally made this available on DVD. 2 DVD set total of 4 HOURS.  Some in color mostly Black and White. This is narrated in English. The BERGHOF was the actual HOME Hitler lived in Bavaria and the Eagles Nest was the MOUNTAIN TOP retreat which still exists today. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set for any one who loves World War 2. the view of his inner circle and his buildings are most interesting. Well worth the price.",1423699200,3,1803,4.4984709480122325
