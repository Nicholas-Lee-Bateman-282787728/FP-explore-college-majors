991654,1,6305226938,"I wanted to vary my workout repertoire between kickboxing tapes, yoga tapes, and Kathy Smith tapes so I bought this dvd as recommended by a friend.  For a non-dancer like me - BIG mistake! The instructions she spelled out were as fast as the dance itself. If you've never tried to dance the bus stop, charleston, strut or military groove, then you're in for weeks of learning the steps not to mention a possible broken ""rewind"" button of your VCR. Luckily, my dvd has a forward-slow but two left feet can still get pretty confuse when they're trying to do it with music.
Her reassurances that ""..you'll get it.."" somehow didn't sound reassuring. I guess I'm more the type who prefers precise instructions so I know I'm doing the moves the right way. After doing this video, I just don't get the feeling of having completed a workout because of the stop-and-go way I do it to follow her moves.  I'll try it on for a few more week and see if with practice i can ""really get it.""  For beginners who are looking for dance-workout video, I would recommend Kathy Smith Latin Rhythmn workout.  Not only does she show how the dance steps are (feet, shoulders, arms, etc.) but she also tells the effects of the moves on your muscles.",988502400,12,1224,4.524886877828054
991655,3,6305226938,"This is not a hard exercise session. I use it for ""Fun"" days since I like to dance. The teaching style is very dancy - no building up you go right in to it and stop between sections. There are ""supportive"" slides that pop up between steps and interupt the exercise session - you need to be very disceplined and keep stepping in order to get real benefit. One last thing - there is very little queing here - so it takes some time until you learn what comes when and stop being surprised.",985219200,3,486,4.180851063829787
991656,5,6305226938,"What a tape this is!  WOW!  Paula Abdul really gets your heartrate going, and she is great company to sweat with. At first the dance moves DO seem a bit complex but they are easily mastered and really work your body out.  What I like the most is that the warm-up is quick and effective, then Ms. Paula takes you right into the dancing.  And how-these are some real funky moves!  She takes it slow(and uses an inset box which I find useless), and after a few times you'll get it.  If anyone expect to pop in an excerise tape and have to routine after only 5 minutes-you have got another thing coming. After the dance routine, Paula does some real great toning and stretching.  The workout really burns in you legs and thighs(hey-it's that ""good"" burn), and the stretching feels fantastic for you back and legs. If you consider yourself a beginner try Paula's first tape ""Get Up And Dance"".  Otherwise pick you this tape(or DVD!) and get to it.",984787200,146,942,4.4678362573099415
991657,4,6305226938,"I love this workout.  I normally hate workout, but when I started this one, I enjoyed the dance steps.  I also found out that I am not that coordinated, but I am willing to learn the difference, when danceing, from my right foot and my left foot.  After the workout, I have energy for the rest of the day, and I find it useful when I am unable to get my other exercises in for the day due to bad weather.",983145600,2,404,3.962962962962963

If you're looking for some inexpensive dance lessons that will improve your dexterity and co-ordination and teach you some funky moves, this is the dvd for you.  It's a fun dvd.  I advise doing the step sections separately a few times before doing the dvd all the way through. I tried going all the way through the first time and got discouraged, but I continued anyway.  It can be very daunting at first.  The stretching and toning section is good but more commentary on what is coming next is needed from Paula so it is easier to follow.  I was looking for a harder workout physically, but I'm happy with the dvd as it gives me a hard workout in co-ordination.  I found I'm not as co-ordinated as I thought I was.  I recommend it if you're not looking for a hard workout but want some light and fun exercise.",980985600,9,886,4.327272727272727

This is such a feel good fun workout that leaves you sweating and tired. The dance group atmosphere is puts you in a good mood. The music is all of Paula's songs but they have a nice upbeat tempo so it 's loads of fun. If you like to dance and don't mind Paula's music, this is a super buy!",1394668800,,403,3.7976190476190474

My grandmother had 'Paula Abdul's Get up and Dance and Paula Abdul Cardio Dance on VHS. I lost a lot of weight. 8 Years later I was out of shape and I wanted something fun... not the usual workout DVD. I looked it up on Amazon hoping they would have it on DVD and they did!! I was so excited. I ordered them both.

Love this workout video... They do dance moves and incorporate a little ballet. It's really fun and challenging! If you're buying this... look for her other workout that I mentioned above. They're both great and you do see results.",1388966400,,645,4.16
991827,5,6305226938,"I got this DVD years ago, but gave it away (and regretted it). I was so happy to see it's still available on Amazon. The dance routines progress slowly, adding on until by the end you have a full dance workout routine. I especially like the different viewing angles that make it easier to follow along. You can tell Paula Abdul is a dancer and teacher/choreographer because she's so good at breaking down the moves and making the workout fun and easy to follow.",1374451200,,461,4.5

991829,3,6305226938,"Not as fun as I expected. Thought it would be more exercise, but felt like activity level was very mild.",1354579200,,104,4.25
991830,4,6305226938,"Paula Abdul leads in this workout, and I believe that she choreographed it, as well.  It's broken down into a warm-up, a workout, a toning segment/cool-down.

Warm-Up-Paula does a short routine, but she doesn't explain any moves.  She just says,""Let's do the 'bus stop'!"" and she does the move expecting the viewer to be able to follow along.  She then goes into a little bit of stretching.

Workout-Paula has 6 main steps in her routine, and she breaks down the workout by teaching 2 at a time.  She doesn't really explain the steps, but she shows them multiple times.  She'll demonstrate once slowly, once medium, once fast, and about three times really fast.  She does this with each move.  I was able to learn the steps by watching the slow part several times (by rewinding), but a beginner might have more trouble following along.  The dance style is kind of a hip-hop and jazz mixture.  I liked the choreography, and I found this to be a good cardio workout.

Toning/Cooldown-Paula starts this segment doing toning, but she ends with some stretching.  Paula's toning method is basically plies.  Constant plies.  She does do a few calf raises, and a few lunge pulses, but mostly it is plies.  After she works your legs, she does a fabulous stretch segment that stretches pretty much everything.  It is very relaxing.

I like this DVD, but it is a challenge to learn.  I don't do it very often, but when I want something unique and funky, I pull this out.  Beginner exercisers will find it too hard, but advanced exercisers won't find it cardio enough.  Intermediate exercisers, however, will probably like this DVD, assuming they have a dance background.",1262822400,,1659,4.77112676056338
991831,2,6305226938,"As a trained dancer, I wanted something fun and dance oriented, yet something to help be burn calories and sweat my butt off! Well, the routine was fun, but the workout itself wasn't as nearly as challenging as I had hoped. I definitely didn't burn the calories that I had anticipated. If you are a beginner, this would be a great workout. If you are intermediate/advanced like myself, skip it and don't waste your money.",1255737600,2,421,4.626666666666667
991832,1,6305226938,"Okay so I think if a certain routine on a DVD requires the person buying it to have a specific item (let's say hand weights or a floor mat), that would be clearly advertised, right?  Nope.  I bought this because I always loved Paula Abdul's dance routines from the 80's and thought it would be fun.  I put the DVD in only to be told I had to do the workouts on a hard floor.  Um wow, could you not have mentioned that somewhere in the description?  I have carpet in my den which is the only room with a TV that I can work out in.  The moves don't work on carpet and you also need more room to move around (something else that's not mentioned) than what I had.  Since I didn't actually get through this workout, I can't rate it on that per se, but I was disappointed that I wasted money for something I can't even do.",1231286400,2,816,4.031055900621118
991953,5,6305226938,"This is a dance tape, not really an instruction tape.  It begins with some standard aerobics moves that take a lot of room.  It then moves to more dance steps taught a little more slowly.  It's not staying in my collection for three reasons:  1.)  It's impossible to do these routines unless you have a clear eight by ten space.  You can't do this in the space where you might do a step workout, yoga or pilates.  2.)  This is a relatively difficult set of dance steps.  (Which might be a positive, not a negative for some folks.)  3.)  These are not the kind of routines you can do in more conventional dance settings.  In recent years, hip hop and bellydance have garnered more interest from the general public because there are people teaching those particular forms of dance in ways that can be done in the small, socially conventional 2 by 2 space of a dance floor.

These are very well done, floor eating dance routines that can't be used like that.

Having said all of that, if you have a drill team, cheerleaders, drama club, or church group where large scale performances of more modern hip hop dance could be useful, and your students have some prior dance experience, this might be a go-to tape for practice. It's easy to watch, and well made.",1223769600,4,1254,4.491150442477876
991954,5,6305226938,"I've had this video for about a year and I work out to it very frequently. The reason? The steps are fun, Paula's energy is infectious and the routine at the end is really fun. It's an awesome way to get your heart rate going and burn fat. I have every type of workout video that there is. Some are too simple in the way that they wouldn't burn enough calories to be worth your time. Others are so hard you dread doing them. Paula is just right.",1197417600,,445,4.068181818181818

991956,5,6305226938,"It took a while to learn the moves -- this is definitely the most choreographed exercise video I've done.  After two or three shots at it, it started falling into place.  The moves are funky and pretty demanding when they've built to a full routine, and Abdul is really professional and smooth in her delivery.  Her dancers were also very good.  They could even follow her directions, which were totally useless.  She'd say we're doing a step left, step right and it would turn out to be a complex combination of steps, turns, dips, arm movements, you name it.  But the workout is fun and before you know it you're doing the toning exercises and cooling down.  It's one of my favorites now.",1196035200,,690,4.560975609756097

991959,2,6305226938,"I gave this two stars because I like the stretching cool-down segment.
The problem is that Paula is not a teacher. She is a dancer and choreographer who is used to working with people who know dance terminology and pick up steps quickly. This is not me. I have done quite a few aerobic dance workouts and pick up the steps in those pretty well,so I know I am not completely dancing impaired, but I just couldn't get this. There is not enough explanation of the steps and transitions. I got frustrated and spent much time talking to the screen, ""I didn't get that. I can't do that. Whatever Paula."" I spent a lot of time just stepping side to side, waiting for something I could do. I wound up making up my own workout and only doing the cool down on this DVD.
I was hoping for a fun workout and was disappointed. Paula is just not an instructor.",1188345600,3,845,4.2875

This is a fun, fast-paced, cardio workout.",1188000000,2,324,4.416666666666667
991961,2,6305226938,"If you can actually get the moves in this DVD down, you have a good workout in store for you.  If you have little dance experience and won't know what Paula's talking about when she tells you to do a ""bus-stop"" as if it's something you do everyday, you may be in for a disapointment. Although Paula's cues are perfectly timed and this can be fun once you get it down, she never breaks any of the moves down, or explains how to do them properly.  It can get very frustrating if you're a beginner, or have little dance experience.  I love workout DVDs and have been using them for years and this, in my opinion, was a waste of money.",1187308800,4,631,4.198347107438017
991962,5,6305226938,"So the moves are a little complicated and intimidating at first, but that's only at first.  When I first tried this DVD I had to pause and rewind, but I still got an awesome workout.  The second time around, it was no problem.
This DVD is fun, feels quick, and gives you a dance routine that makes you feel like you can actually dance :))  it's pretty much only cardio, with a lower body toning at the end, which is somewhat challenging, I suppose...although I never feel it the next day.
For a much longer, and more intense dance workout (with all sorts of toning, try Paula's other DVD, which is also fun...although I think I like the moves in Cardio dance better).",1181779200,2,667,4.40650406504065

992064,4,6305226938,"This Cardio Dance workout will get you sweating. It's challenging to learn the dance steps but, if it were easy, you'd get bored and stop using it. At first, i thought Paula was crazy and still think it's unrealistic to expect people to get it the first time through. Or even by the 5th or 6th time. But, I also realized that I enjoy the challenge, get a great all body workout and don't even notice how  much time has gone by. At first I even went back to try and get the steps a few times and spent an nearly hour on this routine. I had a great workout when I was done but, didn't ever feel like I was working out when I was dancing.

Have patience. The workout is set up with moves Paula is famous for and begins slow, then works up to tempo. Don't worry about doing it perfectly the first few times. Just keep moving and you'll get better and better over time. Just have fun.",1178841600,3,879,4.104651162790698

And, I actually got some of the steps which shocked me. Even if I missed some steps, didn't matter because I was all over the living room jumping and kicking and just have a blast. She and her dancers feel like your friends, not some technical tape with robot dancers even though she is teaching technical basic and what I would guess would be modern dance moves. I love it. And I'm 48 years old, trying to lose 30 lbs and not some spring chicken that just gets up and dancing is like breathing. Gymnastics have always been fairly easy for me (well 35 years ago but I still bend like rubber) but dance, I always just watched from the sidelines because I never thought I could do it.

992066,5,6305226938,"Though not quite as pumped up as Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance dvd, Cardio Dance presents a very enjoyable workout that's easy to pick up again and again! Paula performs this workout in a dance studio with 2 male and 2 female dancers at her sides. It takes place in 3 parts:

The Warm-up-This is a fun, dancy warm-up which consists of combinations of less challenging dance moves to get you loosened up and ready for the full workout. Paula is playful and energetic, and though the dancers are quiet, they're focused and talented and after awhile, the warm-up starts to feel as effortless and fun as the 5 of them are making it look.

The Dance Routine-Paula's workouts have a unique style of dance where you learn each step slowly. The dancers face you at the top of the screen and there's a dialog box at the bottom of the screen which features Paula facing the same way you are (to prevent your hands and feet from getting all mixed up trying to follow along :) It's a great helper!). The steps are funky (though not too difficult for the inexperienced and not too easy/boring for the trained dancers) and they each have their own signature (ie: the 'strut' and the 'military groove') As you perform that step in repetition a couple of times and it gets more comfortable, the music starts to get a little faster each repetition until you're up to the final speed. In this workout, there are 3 sections with 2 steps each, and you practice the sections seperately until finally putting them together for one longer string of steps at the end at full speed. It's very enjoyable and gets your heart rate up for what I believe to be the most challenging portion of the DVD...

Stretching & Toning-Oh boy, this section makes you work hard! You start with a nice, relaxing cool down and then move into a variety of toning exercise for your arms, legs, abs (just naturally, by holding your stomach in while you perform the exercises), and butt. They're very calming and soothing because the moves are slow, but they require a lot of balance and strength (ie: holding your arms out at second position for a very long time while doing different variations of pli'es and then working your arms at the same time when they're good and sore) :) It's terrific, you see and feel the results right away on these and you feel excellent about your workout by the end of the disc!

I've had this workout dvd (including the video before it) for almost 10 years now, and I still haven't tired of it. It helps too, that even the hardest part of the disc is tackled in a soothing way. It somehow makes it easier to get my motivation up to begin the workout. I greatly recommend it to anyone hoping to put a little funk into their workout regime. And then, when you're ready for an even greater challenge, pick up Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance!",1174435200,7,2824,4.477669902912622
992067,2,6305226938,"I was a little disappointed because I like the types of moves she does.  Really she just isn't a very good teacher in this dvd so it takes a few uses to ""get it"" and be able to do the moves with her.",1174003200,,199,3.627906976744186
992068,5,6305226938,"I was totally gutted when I first tried this - as it was just too hard, and too fast to follow, with pretty much NO instruction about the moves! I tried the dvd 3 times - going over and over some of the dance steps each time - but simply could not figure out how the heck her legs were moving!! or in what direction/sequence!  I felt totally frustrated and disappointed - and I gave up, and went back to Denise Austin. I'm not someone who gives up easily, or who is uncoordinated (though I'm not a professional dancer) - and at first this was just too difficult, given that there was no instruction about the moves.  BUT - and this is a huge BUT! 'o)  Now I absolutely love it!!  I was going to write a negative review on this site, and before I did, I read the other reviews - which suggested that some others also found it a little difficult at first - and I did not want to feel I had wasted my  money, so I gave it another try.  And on the fourth try, some of the moves were starting to come together, and I felt such a sense of achievement!  I have since done it 2 or 3 more times, and now feel I pretty much have all the moves figured out - though in the very fast sequences, I still stumble a little when I get lost..  But I TOTALLY enjoy the workout - I sweat!  which is just what I wanted - as none of my other workout DVDs seem to manage this - and I just didn't feel they were enough (which is why I bought this one in the first place!)  I feel I have really worked out after this, but am not by any means worn out - just invigorated.  And it really is fun!  Paula has a quiet charm, is not the slightest bit offensive or loud, and gives just the right hint of encouragement.  I would absolutely recommend this for someone who wants a good fun workout.  I can already feel myself toning up so much more than any other DVD for the past 2 years has enabled me to do!  One warning - don't do the arm stretch segment whilst also doing the leg movements - as the dancers do.  I pulled my neck/shoulder doing this. But that segment is only about 1 minute, and you could do either the arms in isolation-standing still, or do the leg movements only and do the arm stretches at the end.  Highly recommended..",1172016000,5,2210,4.055299539170507
992069,5,6305226938,"Paula does the routine slowly and there is an inset screen showing her from the back.  Then she does it at full speed.  They are difficult routines and will take practice but they look fun and are strenuous so they provide a good workout while having fun.  The only problem with the routines for me is that they require quite a bit of floor space which I don't have.  Still, if you want to work out by dancing instead of boring aerobic routines, this tape will provide that for you.  The tape is professionally produced and a lot of work went into it.  The routines are performed to MUSIC and not a boring rhythm that some tapes use to save themselves having to pay royalties for good music.",1170374400,4,691,4.359375
992070,1,6305226938,"I am a big fan of Paula Abdul's previous workout, ""Get up and Dance.""

My hobby is dancing. I've done paid gigs - and I'm a good dancer.

DETAILS:
I DO NOT RECOMMEND Cardio Dance, - especially not for beginners! Paula is very UNCLEAR in this DVD. She confuses ME and I have experience. SHE JUST DOES NOT CUE properly.

It is odd - at times Paula begins to cue but then for some reason she somehow drops it mid sentence.
She does NOT explain or break down the dance steps - and they are COMPLICATED steps. In fact, what she calls a ""step"" in this video is a SERIES of about 10 or more complicated (and unexplained) MOVES.

My recommendation is: If you like to dance buy her older dance workout (see my reviews) and skip this one. God bless! :)",1169424000,9,934,4.092896174863388

The dance moves are a bit challenging at first, but once you pick them up, you can concentrate on refining them. Each move starts out slow (and once you've picked it up you can work on style and really ""getting"" the move,) and then speeds up.

I must admit that I find Paula great in this tape. Given that she's in the entertainment news quite a bit lately for her... eccentricities, I was a bit apprehensive but she is just awesome. She's light and bubbly, and sassy when she needs to be.

But it doesn't take long and it's fun.  All the dancing moves are fun and creative, even the moves in the warm-up are good and when you've learned them you can dance to most pop music and get a good workout.  Paula doesn't mess around; she teaches you the moves, then there's practice, and then some good leg exercises.  No boring fluff added to make it longer and no marching in place a lot between moves to fill in space.  Highly recommended!",1154736000,6,721,4.5

Paula Abdul is a positive instructor who never gets on my nerves like other videos. The dance moves make you feel pretty hip even if you fumble your way through it! Also, the moves don't feel trapped in the 80s or 90s. They continuously feel pretty ""cool"" and modern.""

992149,4,6305226938,"I wanted to exercise with dance steps as I had some experience in the past. After looking through number of DVDs, I chose this one, and I'm glad I did.

There are 8 variations and I could learn them all after trying them a few times. Paula's fancy moves are intimidating at a first glance, but when you take away all the frills, the steps are actually simple. I don't do anything that might injure my knees. I often convine two steps into one and change a few movements to suit myself. The lower body workout (mostly squats) and cool down are effective too. She's very pleasant and her interview is encouraging too.

The only improvent they can make is to show the steps slowly at first. They are much too fast for anyone who's not used to dancing, but you can overcome the

inconvenience by rewinding the DVD and finding out the basic moves. You need a relatively big space to do all the moves.

I'n now trying to dance with my favorite Welsh music. It's easy to find songs that fit the steps. I say this DVD is worth the price.",1145750400,6,1029,4.316062176165803

However, I love Paula Abdul, and her cheerful encouragement throughout the DVD makes me feel I can learn the steps (her two hunky dancers beside her aren't hard on the eyes, either :).

The routines start out slowly, to give you a chance to learn the steps, but rapidly ramp up to full speed.  I've had to stop and re-start each routine numerous times in order to learn the steps, but I'm not complaining.  With a lot more practice, I will be dancing like Paula Abdul! Her cheery ""See you tomorrow!"" at the end makes me groan, but you know what? I do turn it on the next day, and I can't wait to begin dancing.  At the end, I am sweating and exhausted but exhilarated and already looking forward to doing it again the next day.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the steps had been slowed down even more, for a longer amount of time before going to full speed, in order to familiarize me with the steps.  Paula assumes you already know steps like the Charleston and the box step.",1143244800,7,1162,4.2785388127853885

In addition, you need a lot of space to work in, so you average living room probably won't work.

Paula's other DVD ""Get up & dance"" breaks down steps & music to 3/4 speed 3x & then normal speed, but the dance moves were complex, but popular at the time like the George Jetson, etc. I had trouble with that one even.

The music on this is very mixed/instrumental of Paula's songs that were very uninspiring. This is more complex in my opinion & and even less instruction & you need a lot of floor space. She barely cues & she shows you hand & leg movements at the same time. She does show sometimes her alone w/back to you in lower corner in 1/4 size screen & the upper left 2/3 her & her dancers facing you. I have a lot of other dance dvds that are easier to follow. This is best for fast learners of complex steps & people with dance background. Give you an idea, she does grapevines, charleston, kicks, popping of knees, hopping, etc. all 90s style old school dance video dancing.

The entire warm-up, routine & cool down is done in 27 min.
After is toning mostly the lower body & general stretching for 12 min.

It is in Paula's fun, funky style. However, she doesn't break it down real well.  It is fast to begin with, and gets faster. It needs to start out with 1/2 the tempo it began with. And in ""Get up..."", she does begin slow. However, at the beginning of each segment in Cardio Dance there is a box at the bottom of the screen so you can see what she's doing the same way she's facing.
I found Cardio Dance to be a little more intimidating because the moves are sophisticated, I think, from my background in ballet and jazz.  It uses a lot more space- she uses a lot of the floor both horizontally and vertically. So you need a lot of room to ""travel"" across the floor so you can't do it in an itty-bitty living room.  Paula says that this workout is best not done on carpet as it could hurt your knees because there is a lot of lower leg twisting- salsa/mambo moves and turning- so no carpet in an itty-bitty living room either! So that was frusterating! Altogether it was fun, but I still like her other video which features ""everyday people"" as she calls them versus the professional dancers in Cardio Dance.  There is a 15 minute lower body toning section at the end that I like which includes a lot of plies and is her cool-down as well.",1106697600,13,1384,4.270992366412214

Paula tells you, if you don't get it, rewind a little and look again - nobody ever gets an aerobics workout memorized on the first try (and wouldn't it be boring if we did?).
The warm-up is a set of simple dance moves, and a few stretches (calves, hamstrings, quads).  Then you get into 3 sets of learning dance moves, and finally put it all together at the end.  While it might not be the biggest heart rate jump in the world, it's a fun workout and you do sweat a bit.  The cool down is simple dance-related movements, and then you move on to lower body toning.  The toning part is actually very good - it focuses on plies, lunges, and squats, and is pretty tough!

Paula Abdul is ever-known for her funky dance style, and she really expresses it in this workout video. Granted, the steps are really hard to follow when you try it out for the first time (like I felt yesterday). However, by the second or third time through, YOU FINALLY GET IT. And you get a decent cardio work out while doing it.
More importantly, I think ""Cardio Dance"" emphasizes one component of fitness often overlooked by the fitness denizens of today: coordination! I notice when I take dance classes (including this DVD), I feel more nimble and able to tackle other workouts more effectively. Your stability and posture improve, not to mention your confidence.
You may not sweat buckets doing this DVD, but you will improve your foot coordination and HAVE FUN! Paula's enthusiasm is great, and her program is well-choreographed.  The ballet-based toning exercises are good, focusing A LOT on ""plies"", lifts for your calves, and stretches to finish off.

It makes me smile thinking, as I dance, how scary it would have been to have been a backup dancer in this video and have made a mistake and taken the repremand (said with a grin.)
Digressing...the video is a delight to the eyes with it's understated simplicity; it's cool and refreshing.
You will learn your right from your left in a hurry if you are not a previously-experienced dancer in some very real way. It was hard for me and I've been dancing all my life and won competitions.
You need space to do this video - a bigger than average size room. You can't do it with as much ease on a carpeted surface as you need slide a lot.
Bottom line: this is a dance class, not a work-out video. The cardio is medium, but the mental tango you'll be doing due to professional cueing (you aren't hand-held thru the one, there's no 'learning process' for the steps, and what is demonstrated is done at lightspeed and gets faster from there) will leave you with a very clear impression what kind of dancer you are that day.
Paula's a professional chorographer. Her video reflects her that status, and that's wonderful because there aren't many dance classes to purchase like it. If you are looking to DANCE, you'll be delighted because it takes a week to nail this video and when you do it really flows beautifully and it's great, groovy fun, tho the moves have, now, become somewhat simplistic and a little dated (1998; it's to be expected in any dance DVD).
If you are looking for a modest 'dancy' work-out with easy-to-follow moves, run the other direction. For the average person, this is an 'advanced' dance DVD. Not that that's a bad thing...maybe there's an 'advanced' dancer inside you.",1037664000,21,1842,4.534534534534535

992497,5,6305226938,This video gave me such a workout.  This video will give you a great workout and teach you some great steps.  This video features my favorite singer and choreagrapher Paula Abdul and that is why I bought it in the first place but when I turned it on I loved doing the steps and it started me on a fitness obsession.  Now that I have been on this video I am healthier than I was before I am so happy.  I recommend this video to whoever thinks working out is hard but this video will make it fun but it is still hard.,1027900800,,515,3.970873786407767
992498,4,6305226938,"This workout was really fun.  It was a nice change from hardcore workouts like kickboxing or weightlifting.  I am pretty literate in the dance department, but even I did find it a bit of a challenge to learn the moves at first.  Most workout tapes start with one move and keep adding on as you get the first move.  Paula does go FAST.  I would not recommed this to someone just starting to workout.  But, the dancing is interesting and you don't really feel like you are exercising.  This is a great video for a change up.",1026086400,,522,4.319587628865979
992499,3,6305226938,"I'm not going to say that I didn't get a great workout from this program, but as coordinated as I am I found myself floundering. It's fun and a good workout but the moves are dated and it's definitely not for the uncoordinated.",1017878400,2,227,4.3023255813953485
992500,3,6305226938,"I really like doing this video, I love dancing and the steps are challenging enough for me to make it fun, but it doesn't really get my heart rate up.  It also seems like it would be too complex for people who don't have any dance experience or don't feel that they are very coordinated.  The strength part at the end is very good for your legs, but the dance just doesn't make me sweat enough.",1016323200,2,394,4.171052631578948
992501,4,6305226938,"...for the slightly experienced dancer.  It took me a few times before I felt completely comfortable with the steps, but that's to be expected.  As to the complaint that it doesn't keep the heart rate up - I agree that this could be a problem if you continue to follow exactly what Paula is doing throughout the workout.  I've found, after I mastered the steps, that keeping my tempo up (regardless of how slow she's going) will keep my heart rate up.  You just have to adjust to your own body's needs.  If you do this, the workout will provide you with good cardio for about 20 minutes and a good lower-body workout and stretch for the last 15-20 minutes.
I like to use this DVD on a 2-3 time a week basis, alternating with other workout DVDs I own (including the New York City Ballet Workout, a Tae Bo workout, and a Denise Austin cardio workout).  Alternating keeps the boredom to a minimum, and helps cover all bases just in case one of those workouts neglects some muscle groups.  Combine that with some light weight training and ab work on your own, and you've got yourself a pretty good regimen.",1015545600,2,1102,4.45273631840796
992502,5,6305226938,"I got this DVD five months ago, and I still really enjoy using it.  The steps are really not difficult to learn -- I got it within just a few days (I'm a plus size gal and not all that coordinated).  The the inset box, where the steps are demonstrated from the back view, was very helpful.  The intensity level is just right for someone starting out -- gets the heart rate up without leaving you gasping for breath halfway through.  You can increase the intensity by making the moves bigger.  This workout is easier (and shorter) than Paula's earlier tape ""Get Up and Dance"".
Paula and her group of four dancers are enthusiastic without being shrill.  The steps are fun and they change up enough that the moves don't become monotonous.
The only problem I have is that the stretching and toning section at the end relies heavily on plies and lunges -- and if you have arthritic knees like I do, you won't get very far.  I usually switch to another video to get some stretches I can do more comfortably.
Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.",1013212800,11,1039,4.465608465608466
992577,4,6305226938,"This Video is a real energetic workout and it is fun too. It gets your heart pumping and at the same time teaches you some fun dance moves. It is a little tricky at first to get the moves down. I suggest watching the video first before you try it. A great feature is the shadow box that allows you to stand behind Paula while she teaches the steps. You do need a lot of room to do the work out, but if you are willing to move the coffee table and a few chairs, like I am, IT'S WORTH IT!",1011744000,2,486,3.8217821782178216
992578,4,6305226938,"This video is for beginner and intermediate levels.  The choreography is harder, but if you do the tape a couple of times it will become easier.  It starts with a warmup and is followed by a cardio section with six little dance routines.  It then has a toning section that focuses on the thighs and a stretch/cooldown.  The dances are taught at a slower tempo and after you learn one dance, you put it together with the previous dance, building up to the final routine.  There's a little box in the right hand corning showing the foot work to guide you through.  Has basic exercise video music.  It's a fun video, although if you do it too much it could become too easy and you may be board when the dances are being tought half tempo.  I prefer her get up and dance video over this one.  Get Up and Dance is a little higher impact and moves faster.  Still, this is a fun video to add to your collection.",1011225600,3,904,4.264705882352941
992579,2,6305226938,"Different strokes for different folks.  I found this workout tape to be extremely frustrating because it's seems to be more interested in looking cool than giving a good workout.  I thought the steps were very difficult to master (and I tried, oh, how I tried!), and Paula's background dancers were too annoying to warrant rewinding the tape to see how the ""follow me"" Paula did the footwork.  The only things saving this tape from a completely rotten tomato are the lower body firming segment at the end and the aforementioned ""follow me"" Paula, a window in the lower corner of the screen in which Paula does the steps as though you're dancing a row behind her.  They should have kept that window up a little longer through each dance sequence.",1010534400,3,745,4.707692307692308
992580,3,6305226938,"I bought this video used from someone on this website. I wanted to get into this, cause it looked like fun. Well, believe what everyone says about it! It is hard. If I can do it enough times to get the moves down, it will be a good work out. The problem with it is that she acts like the people doing it at home are trained professional dancers. She doesn't break the moves down enough, or allow you to practice it and really understand what you are doing. If you are a dancer, and understand dance jargon, you will do well, if not, I don't recommend it.",1006473600,2,554,4.138888888888889
992581,5,6305226938,"This is a great work out,for anyone who likes to dance. I don't think you need to be an experienced dancer, just pacient. When I tried the tape for the first time, I viewed and exercised at the same time. That's the great thing about this video, Paula starts you nice and slow at first, and then after a couple of times she'd move into tempo! I did the work out at my own pace for the first two weeks and by the third I knew all of the steps by heart and the right way to do them. Also the 15min. of body toning in the end are definetly helpfull, I saw a change in my body after the third week. The only down fall I would have to say is that I wish she had more dance work out videos, to alternate my weekly routine. Over all this is the only work out video that has definetly been worth my money!",1005523200,,797,3.895705521472393

Also ,  she give you no step by step instructions to get you up to speed. I feel we will have to start our workout education with a different  instructor on an other dvd before we're ready for this .

992583,4,6305226938,"Pop sensation Paula Abdul (who has six No. 1 singles to her credit) hosts this inventive exercise DVD, brought to us by the good folks at Anchor Bay Entertainment.
Paula teaches us multiple dance routines, and they range from easy to moderately difficult.  Some moves will provoke fond memories of her hit music videos such as ""Opposites Attract"", while others are fresh and cutting edge.  Some moves may be a little difficult to pick up in the first few segments, but then she slows it down, takes you by the hand and guides you through them like a pro.
The DVD also features a five-minute behind the scenes segment of her photo shoot, an intruction only audio track, and a music only audio track.
I'm looking forward to her next workout video and if it is anywhere near as good as this and her 1995 ""Shut Up and Dance"" video, we are going to be in for quite a treat!",995846400,3,868,4.41875

I will not lie, it took me about a week to learn the moves. I already had Paula'a first Dance tape learned, so I used that one to excercise when learning this one. ...Anyway it's also great fun and you feel the burn!!

It took me one or two sessions to get used to the steps, but after that you can have fun and not realize you've worked out. It's also a good low impact cardio workout that I can do while I'm currently rehabbing a running injury. You'll generally need a little more space for the choreography, but I've managed to adjust by dancing along the diagonal of my living room instead of going front and back to travel.",1511481600,,586,4.537735849056604
