8637627,2,B00HZQTJ7M,"Once I heard the proposed conductor indicate that the amassed chorus members (being drawn from several factions), would have to agree to not work on anything else during the interim (which was TOTALLY ridiculous, given that it was being done during the Christmas Holiday Season ... the height of choral concerts), and the proposed chorus master indicating that there was not going to be enough time to properly rehearse the chorus, I turned it off, figuring that the final result--if they ever got to it--wouldn't be worth listening to.",1459296000,,536,5.033707865168539

8637629,5,B00HZQTJ7M,I was there in Brisbane during the last part of this epic journey to performance and saw it all come together in a musical miracle. The story is superbly captured in this video production - fans of great classical music will be fascinated!,1400803200,3,239,4.5813953488372094
8637630,4,B00HZQTJ7M,"The Gothic Symphony is not a well-known piece of music, nor is composer Havergal Brian particularly well-known, outside of certain classical music circles. All that may be on the cusp of changing as both Havergal and his remarkable output of musicmuch of it composed over the age of 80!begins to capture the attention of musicologists, performers and audiences.

Judging from the passionate devotion of the principal players in this remarkable documentary, there is much in Brians music to appeal to modern ears. The full-blown Romanticism of Mahler and Wagner is on full display, with a symphonic cohesion that sustains throughout from the earliest, gigantic symphonies (like The Gothic) to his later, more tightly constructed symphonies. Brians music began to be appreciated in the 1950s, but he is still not widely known, so any performance of his music is cause for celebration for afficionados. It takes a particularly enthusiastic devotee of his music to actually try to bring Brians works to performanceespecially when the piece in question is his largest and most demanding (in terms of resources) work.

Its an ambitious subject for a documentary but it succeeds, in large part because the obsession of the filmmakers matches the obsession of the musical organizers. Clocking in at a mere 82 minutes, the film whisks along, covering the various stages leading up to the monumental performance in the Brisbane Performing Arts Centre in 2010. While the brevity of the film may not present a true representation of the grueling months of groundwork and preparation involved, it does capture the obsessive, unyielding energy of the key players. It is high profile performances such as the one documented here that may just put Brian and his music into their proper place in the classical music world. Judging from the tantalizing excerpts heard of the culminating performance in Brisbane, this is a wonderful and worthwhile achievement.

Of particular note is the cross cutting between the frenetic energy and pacing of the organizational nightmare taking place in Australia and the serene, elegiac scenes of Brians elderly daughter in Scotland, who talks with great affection about her father and his music, offering at one point the opinion that the Gothic should be locked up and put away, lending credence to its reputation as being cursed. Shot during the winter when there seems to be inordinate amounts of snow on the ground (for Scotland, at least), these scenes add to the sense of isolation that seem to be an apt metaphor for Brians place in the classical music world.

The success of this musical event, which took five years and involved over 200 musicians and 400 choristers, is a major artistic achievement. Riding on the heels of this event is THE CURSE OF THE GOTHIC SYMPHONY. No one knew if the curse would be broken by the symphony being performed. Risk, commitment, dedication. These are also values at the heart of a great documentary film.",1397433600,7,2966,5.084188911704312
