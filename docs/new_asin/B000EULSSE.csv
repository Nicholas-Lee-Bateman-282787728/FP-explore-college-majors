2535350,5,B000EULSSE,"this guy came from nowhere butt is a rising star among comedians, a very funny story teller who tells you about his life in a funny way, his had a great sitcom butt iy was buried on hbo & not many people caught it & those that did were rewarded with some very funny tv, he will be around for a long time & hope he stays with doing stand up instead of doing a sitcom on network tv, get ready to laugh",1229385600,,399,3.819277108433735
2535351,5,B000EULSSE,"Saw Louis on HBO and had to get this one night stand video. This is absolutly hilarious, Just imagine a pissed off guy who tells you about his different daily excapades and his insights that turn into rants. Here is the good part! You will see yourself in these situations(i did)made me laugh at them now. Just my opinion but He is actually telling/showing us to lighten up, make fun of yourself. Sometimes over the top, but the good ones always are lots of cursing if that offends you. Buy it, it won't disappoint",1192320000,7,514,4.4787234042553195
2535352,5,B000EULSSE,"I never heard of Louis CK before he appeared on Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio. But since his first appearance I have become a huge fan. His brand of humor is pretty dark and twisted, but always hilarious. Lots of family and marriage based material, but don't worry, it never feels hackey.

Anyway, this DVD is great, the only drawback is that it's waaaay too short like all One Night Stand DVD's. More Louis CK would have been more gooder. I would also recommend checking out the Lucky Louie DVD, great show starring Louis CK and Lil' Jimmy Norton!",1183593600,,557,4.514851485148514

2535355,5,B000EULSSE,"louis ck is hilarious.  everyone who ive recommended this to loved it.  its just full of genius bits about playing hide and seek with his four year old daughter, and trying to answer her onslaught of questions, and his fear of going to hell.  this dvd also has my absolute favorite bit about gay marriage.  the bits have lots of profanity, which doesnt bother me, i even prefer it.  my only complaint is that its only a half hour long, although there are deleted scenes that give you a few more minutes of this great comic.  even after repeat viewing, watching by myself, i was still laughing out loud.",1174003200,,602,4.477064220183486
2535356,5,B000EULSSE,"This guy is brilliant!  He has written for NUMEROUS comics like Dana Carvey and for SNL, Conan O'Brien, and others.  He is just plain HILARIOUS!  irst saw this on HBO and ran across it here at Amazon and snatched it up! Funny stuff about every day life with great bits about his wife and daughter.  There is one segment about him being in Hell with Demons that is to die for!  I also just caught his NEW show ""Shameless"" from LA and almost died laughing! If you like this, you'll want that one too!

This DVD also has lots of scenes not in the original HBO cut which are also hilarious--but also not for the faint of heart!  This was WELL worth the money!",1169856000,,655,4.233870967741935

2535358,5,B000EULSSE,"I remember telling my fiancee and her family that HBO was bringing back their Half Hour Comedy show ""One Night Stand"", that was a regular feature back in the 1980's.  Little did I know that we would fine such an amazing and talented comedian.  Louis CK is quick, funny and so hilarious.  We had to watch this special three times to catch all the jokes we missed because we could not stop laughing. Anytime I get into an argument with my friends and family, we end it with ""Shut up and eat your french fries!  Also try to catch his earlier ""One Night Stand"" from 1996 that is shown on HBO Comedy.  Just as funny!",1147910400,16,611,4.278260869565218

2535574,4,B000EULSSE,"Brilliant as allways, but this one is just half an hour long. There are 16 Minutes of deleted scenes and they are as good as the main program, yet some of that material appears in later releases. That's why I rated it only 4 out of 5.",1361232000,,234,4.0

2535576,5,B000EULSSE,"Louis CK is the next Carlin.  His outstanding sense of humor and look on life is precisely the feelings that I'm sure millions of people share.  If you like a comedian that ""keeps it real"" then this is by far a must see along with his others.  He also recently released an online video for 5 dollars that is another full length special.  He is a revolutionary comedian that is surely going to be talked about for a while.",1325980800,,421,4.291139240506329
2535577,5,B000EULSSE,"This is the one that got him noticed! There was no stopping Louie after this... His great short lived HBO series ""Lucky Louie"", 3 full length funny as hell follow up DVD's. I have seen him live twice and he does a whole new set every time I see him. He never rehashes old material. He is the comedian of the over 40 males and females alike! This guy hits it in the pocket from this DVD and onward! From His marriage too his happy divorce! His show on FX ""Louie"" is the funniest sitcom ever! Renewed for a 3rd season...Louis C.K is here too stay! That makes my life a hell of a lot better! Life without laughing your ass off is no life for me!",1320537600,,642,4.062992125984252
2535624,5,B000EULSSE,"GREAT material for me!

The final cut set is pretty short (~30 min), but it kept me laughing--which is better than some that are an hour with some downtime.  Some of the jokes had me laughing harder than I have in a while.  There's plenty of extras too if a 30 minute feature isn't long enough.

There's about 15 more minutes of deleted jokes from the set and you can watch them all back-to-back with a ""play all"" feature.  My ONLY negative for this DVD is that you don't have an option to watch a full, uncut version.  Not that big of a deal though.
There's also an early set Louie did in '95 at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Apsen -- Young Comedians Special -- that's about 20-30 minutes itself.  It's interesting to see how his act and stage presence has evolved.  You can tell it took him a little while to warm up to that performance--not that it was bad or anything.
There is a behind the scenes segment from his first show ""Lucky Louie"" too.  A trailer for the show too.
It's totally worth the current $8!",1313884800,,1015,4.272251308900524
2535625,5,B000EULSSE,"This is Louis CK at his best, just as he was rising to fame.  This 30 minutes flies right by, and it's over so quickly.  It's got his signature cynicism, rawness, and irreverency, but with an honesty and straightforwardness that makes it that much funnier.  The climax is simply brilliant, as Louis relates how he has to deal with an unending barrage of ""why"" from his daughter.  He takes the joke into an arena that I don't see other comedians broaching, describing how his 6 year old daughter questions his answers until he ends up in an existential rant. There are a lot of funny comedians out there, but nobody can go from basement level, sophomoric humor to intriguing philosophical questions within minutes like Louis CK.",1310947200,,727,4.746031746031746

Louis touches upon the sometimes crazy moments one experiences in everyday married life, and many other common day to day observations, much like George Carlin did in his stand-up. Carlin was a major influence on Louis C.K. and his direct ""tell it like it is"" style. If you are a fan of the great late George Carlin like I am, you will appreciate Mr. C.K.'s brand of humor.

A phat load of adult swearing and crude comments.

The extras feature an additional sixteen minutes that were evidently not considered 'worthy' of being put on display. some of it is even worse than the main material. Additionally there is a ten minute appearance he did in 1995 and then portions of his television show for HBO. I felt like I needed a shower after watching. Had never seen him perform.
