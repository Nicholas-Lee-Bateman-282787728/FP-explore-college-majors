8222237,5,B000WC08H6,Ordred this on a whim as a gift for my dad. I was actually looking for children's hymns. I didn't tell him it was coming so he was surprised when he got it.  He said the DVD was nice and that it had some of his favorite hymns.  My parent's listen to it while cleaning house.  I will be getting a copy for myself!,1293321600,2,312,3.84375
8222238,5,B000WC08H6,"I rented this at Netflix, and am hooked. I put it on for restful background images and lovely music. My mother is 90 with dementia, and she is just coming out of a 6 month stupor while under the influence of anti-anxiety drugs. She is just starting to go back to reading simple captions, and she loves looking at this video and reading along with the lyrics. I do the best I can to sing the hymns and clap on the more lively ones. I would never attempt to foist Jesus and God on her while she was in her Alzheimer's/drug stupor, but she is interested in these hymns.

So, not your usual review nor circumstances. But the video was up to the challenge of her reawakening, so I am now buying it. The drugs were Ativan and Seroquel, in case you're interested. If you or loved one is put on these, do some research on side effects, especially on elderly/dementia patients. I think she may have been in hell for six months. I am glad she's better, and too relieved to shake my fist at the heavens.

Oh, I don't like the spoken vocals reading of poems, etc. If one were intently paying attention to the video, then they are fine. But these should serve as background ambient videos, and voices to me are distracting, especially when you are used to the lovely sounds of the quiet Celtic instruments.",1274486400,10,1293,4.383333333333334
