8263491,5,B0016N4358,"Inhumanities 1 is a nice little film . For some it my be too much to handle . If old stock war footage of death and some animal torture is your thing you will enjoy this movie . I don't get into the animal parts myself, But neither the less it's in there . I bought this as it was missing from my extensive collection . This can be found on line on dvdr for a low price so if your interested in watching this movie and don't have a vcr you can still see it .",1369180800,2,458,3.731958762886598
