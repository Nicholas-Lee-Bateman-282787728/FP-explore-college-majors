8577895,5,B00C75VU6Y,A fun and different twist on step aerobics.  I like that added dance stuff and like the challenge of learning new choreography.  This is NOT for inexperienced steppers!,1481328000,,168,4.964285714285714
8577896,3,B00C75VU6Y,"The quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired.  There are multiple parts where the sound goes quiet for 3 seconds.  I don't think the instruction is very good or clear as she usually tells you what she is doing, not what you are going to be doing.  Now that I have done the DVD multiple times I am starting to learn the steps.  It was VERY frustrating at first.  It is a good workout and fun to do, once you get use to the steps.",1449792000,,437,3.9770114942528734
8577897,3,B00C75VU6Y,"This is a bit more advanced than I thought it would be. It's not advanced, just not as basic as I'd hoped in order to get others to join me. I would be happier with it if the instructor showed how to do the unusual moves (dance and step) in slow motion, then a little faster, and finally at speed, but that's not how it works.",1412208000,3,326,3.9545454545454546
8577898,1,B00C75VU6Y,Didn't like this DVD at all. It was more of african dance moves rather than step aerobics. Not at all what I was expecting. There was more of dancing than actually using the step to exercise.,1379548800,7,191,4.333333333333333
8577899,5,B00C75VU6Y,"This DVD is for the Int/Adv stepper who loves step and wants to learn and see something new!!  Fantastic step workout!!
I am a AFAA groupX instructor.  I am always on the lookout for new and fun step workouts to do at home...this one is going to become one of my favorites out of more than 30 step DVD's
ber creative choreography, perfect instruction and fun music.
One caution, the first segment had lots of turns and hops.  For me, the more turns the better, but beginners need to be careful--maybe watch it 2 or 3 times to learn the terminology.
If you are an experienced stepper, you will want to add this one to your collection.",1373414400,4,633,4.3931623931623935
