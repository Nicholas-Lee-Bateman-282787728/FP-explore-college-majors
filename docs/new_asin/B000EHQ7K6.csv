This is an amazing movie.  The idea is simple but unique:  a group of artists reconstruct a barn and use the surface as a blank canvas for giant artworks.  They tape the whole thing and speed it up with time-lapse photography.  The result is unlike any of the other graffiti videos on the market!

The action starts outdoors where we see a group take down a barn.  Then we move inside an art museum where this same barn is rebuilt, piece by piece.  Here the artists begin painting huge paintings with the help of ladders and dollys.  The pieces range from flat, rustic iconography to Dubuffet-looking designs to sci-fi  influenced graffiti.  When one artist is done, the next simply paints over their piece with a new mural.  So if you don't like one, its only a matter of time before the next one pops up anyway.  You watch artists introdce elements and even use some of the previous pieces as starting points for their own stuff.  Some of the artists work alone, others collaborate.  After the last piece is through, they take the barn down again and rebuild it in the same outdoor location.  All of this is set to loose lo-fi rock music.  The entire 3 month exhibition is shown in just under 30 minutes.",1170979200,2,1232,4.552511415525114
