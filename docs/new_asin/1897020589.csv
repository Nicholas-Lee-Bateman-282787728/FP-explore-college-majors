8322794,5,1897020589,"One of the best performed and recorded live concerts in my extensive C.D. collection, featuring Hugh Marsh (electric violin) and Ferguson Jemison Marsh (Chapman stick/bass) along with some great drumming.  Fantastic songs, and xceptionally rendered by some great musicians.  My favorite Steve Bell album and one of my most listened to albums.  Do not hesitate - track down a copy while you can.  Either C.D. or dvd version",1508716800,,422,5.161764705882353
8322795,5,1897020589,"I just read a review by Larry LeBlanc, an editor for Billboard Magazine regarding the Steve Bell Band video. He says; ""Steve Bell is a Canadian Musical treasure. This video is an amazing introduction to Steve and his music."" I have to wholeheartedly agree with that!! If you are a fan of great folk music in the tradition of Bruce Cockburn this video is for you! It's great to see Hugh Marsh on violin and Fergus Marsh on Chapman Stick. They are truly great to see and hear. Some incredible solos! Another quote from a music reviewer in the USA, Brian Quincy Newcomb wrote; ""Intelligent, evocative and emotionally moving..."" This video is extremely entertaining and beautiful to see. Steve Bell is definately going places",933638400,,721,4.82258064516129
