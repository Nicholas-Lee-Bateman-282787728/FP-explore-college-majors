1200751,5,B00000F2M4,"With Omar Hakim on drums, the late great Kenny Kirkland on piano, Daryl Jones, bass, Sting, bass, vocals, guitar, and Branford Marsalis on sax you will see Sting and band rehearse and make the transition from rock to a jazz infused band that loves whats it's doing and shows it on stage.

From the rehearsal in a beautiful french chateau outside Paris to there first gig IN Paris this DVD rocks. Sting knows the sound he is looking for but is open to the creativity of the musicians he has assembled.

You can also see what a hard nosed manager Miles Copeland is and maybe why there was a rift between his brother Stewart ( drummer for The Police)and Sting. Egos were definitely at play here.

This DVD is hard to describe as it has so much too it. I can only tell you I will now finally part with the VHS tape now that it is out on DVD. By it, and see why music is the universal language and how much fun it is to be in a band especially with this cast.",1110499200,4,954,4.145945945945946
1200752,5,B00000F2M4,"Bring On the Night is a rock and roll classic and a must for any Sting Fan.  In 1985 Sting left the Police, the biggest band in the world, after their biggest album and tour, to make a solo album with four unknown, young black jazz musicians from the states.  The sound was out of step with the times, jazz soaked and daring.  The film tells the story of prelude to opening night of the tour in Paris and gives a unique behind the scenes perspective of the genisis of a  band.  Fantastic",1110067200,4,487,4.193548387096774
1200753,4,B00000F2M4,"I can hardly believe it has been 20 years.  Time sure flies.  This is an excellent film, one that is not only insightful about Sting's creative process, but also many other thing besides.  Yes, we do get to see Jake being born, and get to watch Sting cut the umbilical cord.  ""Truth or Dare"" before Madonna?

In the interview at the start of the film, Sting explains ""I can't think of a film that's about a band starting off, beginning.""  And this film not only gives us a post-Police Sting, but also a rather youngish Branford Marsalis, a rather naive Darryl Jones, a rather cool Omar Hakim, and some of the best footage of the late Kenny Kirkland.  Good stuff.

The concert footage in Paris is terrific.  And I just know it would sound AMAZING if the DVD transfer were done properly.  I'm patiently waiting.",1099180800,4,809,4.517241379310345
1200754,5,B00000F2M4,"This documentary captures Sting at his finest.  The guy with the same name appearing in hip-hop videos and selling jaguars should take a moment and revisit this moment in time.  Oh, if Sting back in 1985 could see how his life turns out....the opinionated, angry young man becomes a pop star?!  his younger self would probably rather jump off the thames and drown.  Great performances by some of the finest musicians ever assembled.  Honorable mention goes to Miles Copeland, stings longtime manager for complementing his rather reserved, english demeanor with good old american swagger and for reminding everyone who's in charge.  (the scene involving the dress rehearsal and the ensuing argument regarding the band's wardrobe is quite entertaining)",1093132800,2,750,5.313559322033898
1200755,5,B00000F2M4,"Perhaps the most enjoyable music documentary I've ever watched.  Sting's perfectionistic ways and the rigidity of rock mix wonderfully with the loose, exploritory feel of Jazz.  Seeing ""Dream of the Blue Turtles (perhaps his greatest solo effort) deconstructed is a true music lesson for any person who aspires to be a musician/songwriter/performer.
My favorite scene involves Branford Marsalis pulling out a tabloid and playing off Sting's true name (Gordon Sumner) and comparing his rags to riches upbringing and life, as written in the tabloid, to that of George Jefferson.  Hearing Branford calling Sting, perhaps the most pretentious musician out there, ""Little Gordie Jefferson"" as the band breaks into ""Well we're moovin' on up"" was a total riot.",1075939200,2,753,5.418803418803419
1200756,5,B00000F2M4,"I have no idea why this awesome documentary about Sting is not available on DVD.  The music is awesome and the VHS format can't do it justice.
This video answered one main question for me when I first saw it ... will Sting be worth a darn without the Police?  The answer was hell yeah!
I believe the jazz roots that Sting hit on with the group of musicians he gathered together for his first solo album was his best.  As an artist he's still great, but his musical output is all Sting.  I really enjoyed this video because you could tell that his appreciation for jazz and the artists in his band overshadowed his tendancy to control everything.  I think eventually that's what lead to guys like Branford leaving, but in the beginning Sting was still like a kid in a candy shop verifying that what he suspected could be done, would be done and he would ""help"" to orchestrate it.  I think the artists had almost as much appreciation for Sting (or maybe just curiousity).
No matter, the video is great and should be available as a DVD.",1073347200,5,1033,4.410526315789474
1200757,4,B00000F2M4,"Directed by the renowned British filmmaker, Michael Apted (Enough, Class Action and Extreme Measures) comes this classic behind-the-scenes look at Sting's formation of his first band after the break up of The Police. We actually see and hear the creation of such great songs as, Fortress Around Your Heart, Moon Over Bourbon Street and We Work the Black Seam. As Sting says at a Paris press conference in the film, this is a film about the beginnings of a rock band; where other music films record ""Swansongs"", the end of a band's era, Sting wanted to document a band's formation, growth and the trials and tribulations of a group of musical strangers, working to put it all together. And that's exactly what we get. Included are all the great songs from his first solo album, 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles'. Each musician in the band, through the course of the film, is interviewed about their thoughts on the music and their feelings about working with Sting. We also get a look into Sting's working habits as a songwriter and musician, and we discover that he's a perfectionist and quite the taskmaster.
Most of the film is shot in a beautiful 18th century mansion, once owned by Napoleon the III. This gives the film an almost otherworldly ambience. The band rehearses for hours on end, from the early hours until late into the night, preparing for their debut concert in Paris. As they work towards this debut, we come to realize that there's a lot on the line in terms of Sting's career. The record execs are nervous but quietly optimistic as this is Sting's first solo endeavour. The pressure is on to produce and perform a few hits after the mammoth success of The Police - the rest is history. To add a little more drama, Sting's wife, Trudy, is also about to have their first child. All the band members have a bet on the exact date of the infant's arrival, and as it turns out, Sting wins the bet. The timing of the child's birth (which we see) couldn't have been any better.
This film provides great insight into Sting the man and the artist. Despite this film being almost twenty years old, it retains its allure and has withstood the test of time. It should be standard issue for any Sting fan.",1070150400,12,2209,4.58080808080808

1200875,3,B00000F2M4,"OK, here's the story. I didn't know this film existed. Back in the day, I owned ""Bring On the Night"" on vinyl and on CD. I thought at the time that it was the finest piece of music created by either Sting, or the Police. I still do. Then one day I saw Sting hamming it up on yet another benefit video or some such, playing stuff from his rather tame later career, and I said to myself, ""Why hasn't anyone ever updated and re-released BOTN, expanded it, remastered it, or even (gasp!) made a surround mix. Surely it's got to be one of the best candidates out there for a new treatment, right?"" Well, I kid you not, the very next day, I walked into a local record store, and I saw - THIS!!! I thought my dreams had all come true. Surely this was too much of a coincidence not to be synchronicity, right?

I immediately grabbed it, admittedly without even giving more than a glance to the fine print. ""OMG!"" I thought ""Someone actually had the genius to capture this performance on film?"" I knew right then that my next Friday night music session was going to revolve around this video.

So I put in a Toto concert on Blu-ray, which I didn't expect too much from, while I did some chores and got THE ROOM ready for Sting. Finally, the moment had arrived. I popped in the DVD. It started right up without the usual main menu, so I backed it up so I could choose my sound option. Wow, no less than 2 surround mixes, Dolby and DTS! How awesome. I chose the DTS and let 'er rip.

The video started off with a lot of pre-concert babble. The usual stuff, not too boring, but I can only take just so much. After half an hour, I was getting antsy. I grabbed the insert and checked out the set list. Huh? Why is the running order so different from the album? Why are some songs listed more than once? Why does it appear that my favorite song ""Low Life"" has already been played, when all I saw and heard was a brief session of a few bars in the studio rehearsal?

After a considerable amount of time, the concert ACTUALLY STARTS! The problem is, the documentary NEVER ENDS. Yep, that's right, it's not a concert at all; it's one of those misguided efforts to capture all the fairly mundane and even tedious details that lead up to a GREAT PERFORMANCE, while the performance itself is edited, dissected, commented upon, trampled under foot, and generally destroyed. When the MOVIE reached the CHAPTER titled ""We Work the Black Seam"" (coincidentally, a song exists on the album by this name; it's one of the highlights) I got to listen to 10 seconds of hesitant studio rehearsal which then transitioned almost seamlessly (how clever!) into the stage version, ruining it completely. At this point, I turned it off. I popped the Toto CONCERT Blu-ray back in; it was better than I had expected; it seemed like they had gotten even better with age.

Speaking of which, it seems that one of the main things that most directors of musical performances have learned since 1985 is not to do these stupid mash-ups of documentary and live concerts, which are ALWAYS a failure, at least from the standpoint of enjoying the music. If you want to comment on the music, or the band, or the road trip, fine, but PLEASE keep it separate from the show.

I can't give this film zero or one star. It's not a bad documentary; the sound and video quality are first rate, and if I'd spent more time reading the fine print on the package, I probably would have been clued in to the fact that this was not a straightforward concert film. But I'm not going to compliment this effort because even a complete moron should have seen from the very beginning that this classic performance deserved to be shown in it's entirety, without the ""benefit"" of chopped up songs and a running commentary from the musicians which makes it impossible to appreciate.

Now, if only ""Bring On the Night"" still exists, somewhere, in all it's full-length, uncut glory, perhaps someone, maybe Jonathan Demme for instance, could get ahold of it and bring forth another ""Stop Making Sense"", which is all the ""documentary"" that a classic live performance like this really needs.",1420243200,,4113,4.490641711229946

1200929,5,B00000F2M4,"This is a wonderful film plus concert that show a young Sting in perhaps the second phase of his career after The Police. It takes place in Paris where Sting introduces a new group of African-American musicians he's put together for this special film, achieving a new, unique sound.

For anyone who's followed Sting's career, this is an important look into his musical evolution. He sings many of his well know classics, but reinterpreted. And all are great.

There's lots of humor in this film/concert. And also included are several very personal segments with his wife Trudy Styler. But I don't want to give the best part of it away.",1409961600,2,635,4.763636363636364
1200930,5,B00000F2M4,"Honestly, is there anything Sting can't do and make it look so cool? Sting's first post Police project was a risk in 1986 and the result was amazing. Sting shows that he is not just a 1980's New Wave guy but a clever fellow with many ideas worth listening to. As with any artist, Sting is always testing himself and changing ideas of how he interprets old songs and newer material.
  Sting fans will love this DVD as we see how he began to grow away from his Roxanne arrival to become the man who gave us the great  ""Desert Rose"" and "" If On a Winter's Night"".",1399593600,,560,4.166666666666667
1200931,4,B00000F2M4,"The music is wonderful. Branford Marsalis and company really helped Sting grow as a musician. The documentary, however, is not as enjoyable. It's hard not to find Sting to be a bit self-absorbed at times. Nonetheless, this is a ""must-own"" if you enjoyed the first three studio albums from Sting.",1396310400,,295,4.92

1200933,5,B00000F2M4,This film changed my life as a musician.  I've known about this film for years. It's a part of history now to see a rock musician be so versatile with music style.,1372118400,,163,4.09375
1200934,4,B00000F2M4,"While Sting can never capture the impact The Police hold on a live show, this band he puts together warrants some praise in putting up with him and his cast of misfits that follow him around, yet, its interesting to see him work a song, as he does in Bring On The Night. The film also reveals emotional and personal footage with the birth of his son Jake to the tune of ""Russians"".

The music is clean and jazzy, perhaps in Branford Marsalis and keyboardist Kenny Kirkland along with drummer Omar Hakim, this is what will happen when you throw in soon to be Rolling Stones bassist Daryl Jones in the mix.

These are all strong and talented artists mating with one of the industry's leading players and producing a sound which I believe is what Sting really wants to convey at this point in his career during the mid-eighties, but hasn't been able to since, ""The Dream of The Blue Turtles"" and ""Nothing Like The Sun"".",1371859200,,916,4.479041916167665
1200935,5,B00000F2M4,"This is one of the greatest works of the 80s, and still very influential today. Sting and all the other band members demand respect, and they get it. I could sit around and watch is over and over for days and never get enough.
I played it as background music at a party and at one point found about 20% of the guests sitting there staring at the screen, enthralled in its every moment.",1363305600,,385,4.216216216216216
1200936,5,B00000F2M4,"This is a true classic early rockumentary (or I suppose jazz-rockumentary).  Younger kids of today may think everything was always shot in ""reality"" style, but it was not.  That said, it is quite amazing how pretentious it is compared to something you'd expect to see today.  Sting came up from a humble background to create a persona that developed into that of a modern day self made Prince or Lord of sorts and self proclaimed Champion of Worthy Causes. So why not have a vanity piece for your new project shot in a French chateau? Thankfully, his musical brilliance made this precious behavior tolerable and this video covers his arguably best solo album (his first), which was a very bold and brave departure from his starring role in the biggest band in the world just before this (The Police). It is fun to watch the powerhouse band develop songs during practice jams and the self importance of the between segment chatter (including  Miles Copeland's frenetic rants, themselves worthy of a Spinal Tap style parody) is all forgiven as soon as Sting hits the stage and belts out fantastic versions of his songs in concert.

Any Sting fan must have this! I find the audio and video quality of the DVD to be excellent, and from looking at the reviews here, it doesn't seem like the Bluray version represents much of an improvement, so I am content.  This is Sting at the height of his creativity and in a great period of discovery, something fans will watch again many times over the years.",1356220800,3,1494,4.683206106870229
1200937,4,B00000F2M4,"I had taped this off of Bravo or another channel back in the day, but have not watched it for years, especially since I haven't owned a VHS player since 1998 or thereabouts. It's as good or better than I remember, especially in our modern world of 5.1 sound. Definitely an interesting look into the making of an album and the controversial (at the time) change in direction for Sting. The person who decided that the credits should roll OVER Sting while he does a solo performance of Message In A Bottle during the encore should be locked in a room with one donut and Rosie O'Donnell. Seriously?? There's not enough space on this flipping DVD to roll the credits on a black screen?? You gotta do it over arguably the most iconic song in modern pop history?

1) Omar's drum solo on 'I burn for you'.

Grain structure is preserved nicely and thus Michael Apted's vision. Kudos to those involved not using crappy DNR which destroys fine detail.

Both the DTS-MASTER Audio and Lossless PCM 2 channel Audio are highly crankable and sound amazing. Kudos again to those involved this time for not squashing the audio via digital crap-ery [Limiting, etc].

Cons: The disc plays directly from insertion and does not offer a main/start up menu. Horrible video quality which would be barely suitable for VHS, in fact it appears as though this version was created from VHS. As another reviewer wrote, this is from Sting's (very) early and yes an even more pretentious stage in his career. Audio quality is equally horrible.

Pros: I like Sting and I have a fancy, new expensive Sting coaster. I have learned to never buy blu-ray on impulse, without first reading reviews.",1261526400,9,619,4.830188679245283

It isn't a full length rock concert - it is more of a documentary - and it was probably very enjoyable in its day. However, it isn't much of a spectacle as a Blu-ray offering and I'm afraid that, despite being a fan of Sting and his work, I just didn't enjoy his persona in this recording. Maybe Blu-ray has just the raised the bar on recent recordings and hence, in comparison to other offerings, my expectations were not met here. Most Sting fans will like this but will probably also own the DVD already - there is nothing in my mind to justify the increased cost of Blu-ray.",1243123200,9,712,4.32089552238806

1201024,5,B00000F2M4,"I hadn't seen this on sd dvd but I enjoyed the content. I became interested in Sting a little later than when this was made so I learned a lot about Sting. The video quality is poor. Although the colors are good there is a lot of grain, some dirt and white sparkles throughout. I know this was made years ago so that may account for it. I don't know how it compares to the sd dvd. The audio is lacking LFE and bass. It isn't obvious the surrounds are used, I had to stand by the speaker to check. Since I don't have the sd and I was able to get this for less than the cost of the sd, I'm glad I bought it. You might want to give it a rent before buying to check it out for yourself.",1229731200,,682,3.8098591549295775
1201025,5,B00000F2M4,Let's face it. If you buy this DVD you are interested in Sting. You get alot more but as other reviewers have said it is not a full concert video nor a full flavor of the transformation of the songs. But you will get a very interesting look at Sting as he left the Police and went out on his own. Every Sting fan should see this.,1209340800,,329,3.925373134328358
1201026,5,B00000F2M4,This video offers a rare look inside the preparations for Sting's groundbreaking concert tour with several world class jazz musicians.

The bringing together of a new band, with interviews with them and him.  It shows them growing together moving towards Sting's first concert after leaving The Police.  The new music is from Dream of Blue Turtles and some older songs reinvented.  The band members come from jazz backgrounds, as does Sting, and I think it gels and rocks!  The music, from my perspective, is what I call fusion - rock, jazz and blues.  I love this movie and the music.",1198195200,,571,4.594059405940594

1201051,5,B00000F2M4,"It's an excelent film about an extraordinary album Sting made. Ideal for those who remember those days or for those who want to get to know them. I saw one concert of the subsequent tour they made, it's among the best ones I ever attended. Enjoy!",1174953600,2,246,4.369565217391305
1201052,5,B00000F2M4,"Music documentaries don't come much finer than Michael Apted's 1985 classic ""Bring on the Night"".  In the film, exquisitely photographed on 35 mm, Apted documents the rehearsals of Sting's then-newly-assembled backing band and ultimately their first concert.  It's a surprisingly fascinating and stunningly well-made, let alone highly insightful, look at the preparation that went into the performance as well as the dedication and skill of the band and their rather stiff leader.  The members are completely open about their feelings toward Sting and the band, as well as the direction in which it was headed; it is hailed as a work of genius, at once a anti-racial statement and a brilliant melding of intense jazz and intellectual rock.  And while it may be just that, it's Apted's delectable film that is the real work of genius here.

We see the astounding skill of the backing band members, Sting's dedication and controlled brilliance as well as his near humorlessness, which the band members (particularly a charmingly young Branford Marsalis!) are all-too-happy to mock.  We see that former Police manager and current Sting manager Miles Copeland (yes, Police drummer Stewart's bro) is actually something of a jerk, but a talented manager.  We feel the tension of opening night, and that is why Apted's film is so great.  Unlike the average documentary, we are not outsiders looking in at a little glass bubble and seeing the machinery work; we are there with the band, along for the ride.  We are amazed at the hard work of the band, and we too struggle against the pressure that the band fights.  We cannot wait to see the fruition of the group's efforts.  Apted makes us feel, and that is why ""Bring on the Night"" is such a masterpiece.

Of course, there's also the music.  The concert is fantastic, offering new compositions, a few blues and jazz covers, and some jazzed-up reinterpretations of former Police tunes.  Particularly wonderful is a dazzlingly soothing performance of ""Fortress Around Your Heart"", a sumptuous rendition of ""I Burn for You"" oozing sensuality, and a gleaming, utterly beautiful performance of ""Message in a Bottle"" featuring solely Sting on his guitar.  Another highlight is a memorable sequence in which, while Sting's bombastic, paranoid ""Russians"" plays in the background, Sting's wife Trudie Styler gives birth to their son.

""Bring on the Night""'s long-awaited DVD release is worth the wait.  The picture is simply gorgeous, and the DTS sound mix is fantastic, making you feel even more like you're present at Sting's first solo concert.  The DVD also includes three Sting music videos as well as the original trailer, radio spots, and the option to create a ""personal playlist"".  Over twenty years after its release, ""Bring on the Night"" remains one of the very best and most riveting music documentaries ever released, and this DVD is an essential purchase for Sting fans or any musically-inclined soul who wants to experience a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking.",1173830400,2,3014,5.10183299389002
1201053,5,B00000F2M4,"I saw this more than 25 years ago, First Sting solo adventure and was, as today, amazing.  The band (Kirkland, Jones, Marsalis and one of the greatest Omar Hakim) is by far the best band Sting has used on a recording studio and on tour.

Don't think about it and buy it!!!!",1169683200,,273,4.230769230769231
1201054,5,B00000F2M4,"I had this concert years ago on videotape. It is wonderful to see it again, and it is one of Sting's best works. The mix of his songs with jazz players backing him up is great! Sting is not shabby on guitar, and the dynamics with him on electric are definitely interesting.

Especially love watching Omar Hakim, and Darryl Jones has to be one of the most solid bass players out there.

This will be watched many times!",1168473600,,418,4.346153846153846
1201055,5,B00000F2M4,"I was ecstatic when I heard this was coming to DVD. I remember attending a screening of this film when it came out in the mid-80's. I have always loved this movie. Sting is an incredible person; charming, funny, extremely talented. His persona as being the ""deep"", ""tortured"", arrogant rock star is so far from the truth. Having met and conversed with him a few times, I can say he is truly the reverse. He's kind and attentive. This film shows some of that certainly. And of course, for his first post-Police venture, the music and live performances are what you would expect from a man like Sting: incredible.",1156982400,,611,4.614678899082569
1201056,4,B00000F2M4,"a solid addition to the rockumentary genre. this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars.

looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career (and arguably he was solo with the police). at the time of this movie, it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting. the music is super, the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness.",1154908800,,483,4.366666666666666
1201057,4,B00000F2M4,"This is a documentary movie and the notes in the back of the DVD say it all. In 1985, after quitting a highly well succeeded pop outfit, The Police, a band that really managed to merge reggae and rock without plastering any style, Sting, a former jugg-band and of course jazz musician, sought how to expand the boundaries of his compositions, this an item that suffered restrictions within that band. For that, during the period of his first solo work was being done (""The dream of the blue turtles"" album), Sting gathered in Paris one of the finest collection ever of musicians, all black and all of a jazz background, horn man Branford Marsalis, keyboardist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Omar Hakim, bass player Darryl Jones (now a Rolling Stone) and singers Janice Pendarvis and Dolette McDonald. ""Bring on the night"" focus on the birth of not only a new band and a new perspective in music (represented too by Trudy Styler giving birth at one of hers and Sting's children) showing without criticism or apology statements from Sting (where some of his insecure is evident), band members (a clever one by Marsalis) and the tense manager Miles Copeland, all well structured by director Michael Apted in a comprehensive, didactic way. Rehearsals in a stupendous castle together with some smart cuts joining creation and stage performances are worth the price of this movie although too short for concert fans and today patterns of footage. Police material is shown just in fragments and performance centered in new songs, as ""Shadows in the rain"", ""Consider me gone"", ""Fortress around your heart"" and ""We work the black seam"" - with a wonderful solo by Marsalis - and all are breath taking. As a bonus, views of Paris are always refreshments, and the wonderful quality of the picture must be praised, as well as the carefully mastered sound. A must for music fans of all kinds.",1153958400,4,1871,4.85
1201058,5,B00000F2M4,"Branford Marsalis says in the film about Sting's music:  ""The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say, 'This s$!t is out.' ""

When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.

'Bring on the Night' is a movie about the launching of 'The Dream of the Blue Turtles' album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"" is a response to his earlier ""Every Breath You Take"".

Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.  In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, ""I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.""  Good protest songs are made to be sung.

Some of the lyrcis from the movie include:  ""One world is enough for all of us.""  ""Love is the seventh wave.""  ""I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.""

Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  ""If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.""

This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.  If you are a fan of acapella or minimal accompaniment, the film has amazing, open versions of both 'Roxanne' and 'Message in a Bottle.'",1151107200,3,2178,4.523076923076923
1201079,5,B00000F2M4,"Gigantic as Sting is, for me, he is still in the TDWR category. This exceptional DVD provides an insight into the genius of Sting as a star, songwriter, singer, musician, guitarist and actor. (And I think he knows a bit about bass too) This is Sting ""bridging the chasm"", showing his incredibly rich colours as the greatest jazz rock musician ever. Whoa! That's a big claim! Or is it? Does anyone else come close? Well i love Steely Dan, but they don't have the incredible reach of this living legend who has reached ears and hearts in every crevice of the world. And if you count looks, voice and charisma too, then there is no one even remotely close.

This is a promotional film for the ""Dream of the Blue Turtles"" album and also a documentation of a historic concert tour with a band that is made up of some the finest Jazz players of the 70-80 fusion era. Each one plays within Stings unique version of this genre and excels. It would be hard to compliment any one of these musicians, as each is playing at a mind blowing level. Omar Hakim certainly gets a chance to show his awesome prowess, as does everyone else in varying degrees.

The song line up is the entire DOBT album plus some, ending in what may well have been the first solo version of ""Message in a Bottle"" that was to become a Sting concert signature. The transfer is well up to Sting's very high standards, in particular, the DTS audio track. Hey! This film was made in 1985 in stereo, on film! The extras are good fun too!

Sting's acting skills are on display as well, for the 'rehearsals' shown here are probably after the DOBT album was released, which would mean that all these musicians, not exactly amateurs, know the music by heart already. Knowing this titbit however, takes nothing away from this film or the music. In fact, it highlights one more facet of the immense talent of Sting. And some of the script, the interviews, well, this is a movie and it looks like a well made documentary. Congratulations here to Michael Apted on an amazing job.

There is even a section showing the actual birth of Stings child, set to a haunting backdrop of ""Russians"". And a glimpse into the photography of 'Mad' Max Vadukul. I mean, how much more could you possibly ask for?!! The whole concert perhaps. But then you may not buy the cd, which is a 'must have' for any Sting fan. And between the 'rehearsals' and the concert, everything is pretty much covered here. Incidentally, the rehearsals are set in a old and stunning Chateau in Paris. Btw, the concert's in Paris too. (!)

To think that this was just the beginning of a beyond extraordinary career, makes it even more staggering. If you consider that this was his first ""solo"" tour, so to speak, this is Sting at his musical and theatrical best. If you are a Sting fan, then you already own this dvd. If you aren't...buy it and you will be a Sting fan instantly. And he released 7 more brilliant albums after DOBT! Plus 3 more. Staggering?!!! This Englishman's all over the globe!!

1201083,5,B00000F2M4,"I was very pleased to see ""Bring on the Night"" released on DVD. I remember seeing this movie in the theaters many years ago and always wondered why it hadn't made it to digital, but no more!

  The viewer can ignore the ""dramatic"" subtext of the movie (""Can Sting, risking his career, make it as a solo artist playing with jazz musicians?""; I think that the answer was never in that much doubt)that they try to establish through a series of interviews with Sting and others. Sting is overly stiff and didactic (and, frankly, boring!); the only guilty pleasure is seing Miles Copeland (his manager) run roughshod over evryone who is not Sting.

  This movie is about the band and the music that they create. All of the band members are exceptionally strong; you can see and feel the pleasure that they get from playing with each other (check out Omar Hakim's smile as he solos in the middle of ""Burn for You""). The set list draws from (for me) Sting's best solo work and some tasty new arrangements of Police hits (the plaintive ""Message in a Bottle"" stands out). But the best thing in this movie is the FUNKY jazz groove that the band adds to Sting's compositions. Check out the extended jams on ""Consider Me Gone"" and ""Bring on the Night.""

  In short, if you want to see and hear musicians playing great songs WITH, not against or over, each other (listen to Branford Marsalis' sax support the melody and the message of ""Fortress Around Your Heart""), check out this movie.",1125100800,8,1474,4.574144486692015
1201084,5,B00000F2M4,"Whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning Sting's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80's New Wave scene to Serious Jazz Artiste, the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there. Director Michael Apted delivers an ultra-slick production  with an ""A+"" grade in the cinematography, editing and sound departments as we follow Sting and his crack back up band (ex-Weather Report, Miles Davis players) rehearsing in a French chateau for a ""debut"" performance in Paris. Most of the material is from the outstanding ""Dream Of The Blue Turtles"" album (which Sting has yet to match since-this WAS his artistic peak, IMHO). There are some ""oh so precious"" moments-especially a sequence depicting a ""goofy"" photo-shoot in Paris, with Sting being chased through public squares (and most embarassingly, a public fountain-what, suddenly he's Anita Ekberg in ""La Dolce Vita""? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez, who I really wished to see drop-kicked into the Seine. My favorite ""Spinal Tap"" moment: Sting's dictatorial manager (Miles Copeland, former Police svengali and founder/president of IRS Records) goes off on a set designer for her ""lack of imagination"" on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the Big Show, against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that Sting had told her he WANTED a ""Brechtian effect"". (You couldn't write something that funny.) The tardy yet belated release of the film on DVD should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics,sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period.",1119225600,3,1665,5.235955056179775
1201085,5,B00000F2M4,"It is about time that this ground-breaking video finally made it to DVD, making it even more of an audio and video treasure. I can still remember the first time I saw the special on A & E almost 20 years ago.  I had lost track of Sting and his wanderings after he had left the Police, and wasn't quite sure I wanted to find him anyway given the negative publicity (and my own disappointment) surrounding his departure from what is still regarded as one of the best rock groups of all time. Unsuspecting, while lounging on my back porch I flipped through the cable channels and stumbled onto the program as it had just begun. For the next 2 hours I became mesmerized.

The project was an unprecedented undertaking at the time, recording a band not only in live concert but through the whole process from inception to rehearsal to performance. The concept was as risky as it was revolutionary, especially for Sting who had everything to lose by not only gambling on a solo project, but by making this effort so accessible in such a unique manner to the viewing public. In its form and feature, it was also a prototype for what would become ""reality"" TV, long before there was such a category.

Beginning with location shots of the band in rehearsal at a French castle just outside Paris, we get an impressive portrait of Sting shaping a new musical ensemble: he lays out the rudimentary form of his original compositions, then brings them to life, gently but confidently directing his very talented charges, mostly accomplished African-American jazz players, through the complex arrangements, allowing for their contributions along the way. What becomes abundantly obvious, beyond his now-and-again reserve and arrogance, is Sting's finely-tuned sense of artistic expression, complemented by his technical knowledge of the medium. He knows what he wants and how to articulate it. In addition to the picture of music and musicians coming together, there are unpredictable and insightful interviews with Sting and other members of the band spliced strategically into the body of the video. Apted's editing is excellent in these instances and rather spectacular overall. At times he even synthesizes the scenes from the concert performance of a song with those at practice, the two segments pieced together as one without missing a note or beat. We also are provided usually unseen glimpses of the band's manager, Miles Copeland, ensuring that peace reigns among the musicians while securing the preparations and publicity for their debut. We are fortunately not subjected to tantrums, petty arguments or catty exchanges, so typical of today's reality TV content, but we do see banter among the members and several spontaneous moments. The camera also, perhaps dubiously, follows Trudy, Sting's wife, to the hospital where we witness her giving birth to their son Jake. The event actually occurred while this was being made,  and it is still part of the footage.

The ""Bring On the Night"" video culminates in the live concert. Not surprisingly, despite playing unfamiliar music with an unorthodox mix of instrumentalists in front of an SRO French (that's non-English) audience in Paris, Sting brings the house down. The finished songs are both well-polished and exciting as is their performance, which is near flawless. He finishes the evening with an encore of a few selected Police songs, including ""Message In a Bottle"" which he sings alone on stage - while final credits roll. The show removed any lingering doubts in my mind, low those many years ago, that the lad from Newcastle is indeed a musical genius. Now in this digitized format, it sounds and looks better than ever and is as inspiring as it was two decades before.",1116201600,4,3724,4.980707395498392
1201086,5,B00000F2M4,"This is simply one of the best music DVDs ever made. You don't have to be a

Sting fan to be turned on by the overflowing energy, joy, and musicianship which this band exudes.  The only other music DVD which comes close to this is the Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense. If you liked that, you'll love this.  But Bring on the Night goes way beyond Stop Making Sense, as it is more than just a concert video.  We are shown numerous rehearsal scenes which give you a feel of how this band worked together, as well as interviews with the musicians which are both insightful and hilarious (especially Marsalis). Hakim's drumming is smoking throughout.  Marsalis' playing is always interesting, reinforcing the impression he often gives of being best when he plays other peoples' music. Sting's and the backup singers' vocals are piercingly beautiful.  The sequence where you are taken into the delivery room for the birth of Sting's son, with ""Russians"" playing in the background, is truly moving.  The sound and picture quality of the DVD transfer are even better than the original.  It is a mystery why this movie was not a blockbuster success when it was first released 20 years ago. It is a bit pretentious, but after all, Sting IS a Brit and the pretentiousness of Sting in this movie pales in comparison with what followed in pop music, especially among Rap artists.  Perhaps the DVD version will enjoy the success this remarkable film is still due.",1114905600,3,1449,4.741035856573705
1201087,5,B00000F2M4,"...the best dvd-release of Sting (so far anyway) besides, of course, the fabolous and fan-dedicated ""All This Time"" from 2001. They share some similarities, the behind the stage/the performance-""mixed"" footage, or easier said; we are invited to see parts of the rehearsal, parts of the show, and there are interviews with all the musicians with Sting in the lead. The main difference is; this whole consept behind the 1985-release (and tour) of the ""Blue Turtles""-material was the big risk Sting was taking being a settled artist, but with this new sound, style and (not least) the musicians he'd hired things indeed could have ruined his reputation and carreer. As you very well know, it didn't! He recieved standing ovations from audiences all over, and became a hit also as a solo-artist. Me myself, well, being a Sting-fan mainly, and not of Police -let's just say that I'm not surprised. Sting is one, if not the one, of the most talented composers and performers (including the musician he has and still works with) in the world today, and this release is another proof of that. I am so happy ""Bring On The Night"" finally has been released in this format. The sound is superb, the picture too -so let's throw away the old tapes now and really enjoy this!

If you have a capable system, see it in DTS -the drum-opening on ""If you love somebody..."", it's like being there!

Sting somehow becomes, ironically, an ""early"" Eminem (not that I compare them at all, they far from share much of anything else, but) the fact that they were both the only white in their black groups and collegues, Eminem with rappers. Sting theming up with these talented jazz-musicians, and of course, this inspired his composings and performances. Not that it's jazz, actually it is hard to catogorize any of Stings' music. It's kind of ""continental"". But a lot of the improvisings naturally goes over into jazz. And in 1985 the band was facing a lot of shared opinions about their project. (like Eminem had to face until he convinced his audiences, and that's the similarity I find.) But this was before the final result. Sting convinced as well, and from here it has mostly been ""going uphills"" for my favorite artist.

Let me add to this that Stings' early influences take roots in jazz, and he was playing with jazz-musicians in the early days of his life. You can read about this in his biography ""Broken Music"". Recommended by the way!

""Bring On The Night"" is very inspiring, and interesting that way. Sting is not the only reason for this, the interviews and opinions and presentation of the band is also ""very new"", and presents the project in a way I'd never thought of it before. You get respect for they opininons on the music business none of them see themselves as a part of, it's all about the performing and the love of the music. You realize this, and I especially enjoyed the interviews with Branford Marsalis. Also it is funny to see their unserious sides between the rehearsals, and the way they make fun of Sting in friendly ways.

This is the kind of release that makes you wish you could be the artist if just for a day, and it puts a smile on your face long before the credits start to roll.

This is a landmark video - a reality video before the genre took off- and a very telling effort that relates the drama that unfolds behind the curtain for one of the most influencial rock musicians of the last couple of decades.  An all-star line-up that features some of the jazz world's greatest young lions of the time:  Omar Hakim (drums), Kenny Kirkland (piano), Darryl Jones (bass) and the venerable Branford Marsalis (sax).  A truly stellar band playing some of the most progressive music of the time.  The cd features different versions of the songs from the video release, which, most people who have seen the video will agree, was one of the most heinous crimes in the history of soundtrack releases.  Be sure to check out the blazing solos in many of the songs; Kenny Kirkland's solo in the title track, Omar Hakim's drum solo - which seems to disrupt the fabric of time and space -  in ""I Burn for You,"" and Branford's smoldering-to-full-on-scorching solos throughout.",1110758400,13,1148,4.738693467336684
