8206221,4,B000SPKNDG,"This along with the documentary "" Rediscovering America: The Salem Witch Trials"" by Johnathan DOnald productions for the Discovery channel, were my two introductions to the Salem Witch Trials in 8th grade.  This movie was made in the 70s so the semi cheesyness of the acting can be overlooked as well as not full detail.  While this isn't even close to telling the full story, its pretty good for a half hour movie.  Definately more accurate than the crucible.  The trials are one of the biggest cases of injustice that exists in American History and it shouldn't be overlooked. FOr any history teacher, i'd recommend both of these films... this one and the documentary mentioned... when teaching this topic. It may not be fully in depth but hopefully will encourage students to further research the trials and learn from them. The old saying is true "" if we don't learn from the past, we'll be sure to repeat it""  The witch hunts have been repeated again and again, most notably, in the McCarthy trials in the 1960's.  Lets learn from Salem with an open mind, without any biased opinions of witches, christians, etc. and not repeat what happened in 1692.",1327968000,,1155,4.75
8206222,5,B000SPKNDG,"While this series,""The American Experience"" is a bit dated, the stories none-the-less provide riveting historical dramas that are great tools in the teaching of American History. I have used the series for over 20 years with middle school American history classes, and the episodes are accurate as well as tastefully done.  This particular episode is especially interesting for students, exploring the issues of intolerance, cultural and historical misunderstandings, and how experiences such as these during our nation's past led to the development of due process of law as well as the separation of church and state.",1239667200,4,618,5.4375
