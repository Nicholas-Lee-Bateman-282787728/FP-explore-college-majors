2661142,1,B000ION79Y,"The worse Steven Seagal I have tried to watch.  I have every one of his movies, have put up with loose shirts, etc. but dubbing his voice really agravated me.  He has a destintive voice and when it is dubbed you know it.  This doesn't even deserve a 1 star.",1165536000,4,257,4.1
2661143,5,B000ION79Y,"When I went to rent this gem, I was joking with a friend that we should ask the girl at the counter if she thought this one was good.

To my surprise she was totally excited and said she thinks Segal is so hot, and that she is glad he lost weight for the amazing new movie.

She was obviously not a true fan because when I asked her if she saw him on the Mojo Priest Tour she had no clue.

Regardless, I popped this bad boy in and was blown away.

The cover art was a photoshop, Seagal was still pushing 300lbs, so he is still a beast.

Half the movie was over dubbed, I went back to check to see if I selected english overdub in the menu. No sir, this must be a new trend in movie making, to lose your audio tracks or rather not be able to use them, and overdub actors voices with different voices through out the movie.

The fighting as mentioned before has Seagal, slapping away at his foes, which totally turned me on.  The story was amazing, a drug that mutates, people into savage killers, yet leaves them civilized at the same time.

The dirt bike scene from the beginning was my favorite, they used the dirt bike sound effects from Grand Theft Auto then a helicopter blew it up with missiles that looked a lot like black jacks exploding.

Overall, the first 15 minutes summed it up.

AWESOME.  Don't rent this movie buy it, keep them making this movies please.",1165536000,6,1368,4.203065134099617
2661144,1,B000ION79Y,first...I'm a huge fan of seagal..not only as an actor but the fact he can really do this stuff he does in movies.  He does look alittle skinner than in Black Dawn......but still this movie was so horrible...and whats up with the dubbing seagal's voice...that was so annoying.....I hate when they do that...whats the reason......this was a hard hour and half to sit through....i kept looking at the time to see when it would be over.....i own this movie only b\c i own all his movies.....so if you are not a die hard seagal fan don't waste your time,1165536000,5,549,4.545454545454546

2661146,1,B000ION79Y,"I don't know why Seagal even bothered to show up for this one. Like the Exorcist, his voice changes at least 2 times with horrible dubs. He's fat with some kind of rat's nest growing out of the back of his head.

This is Seagal at his embarrasing worst. The last 5 or 6 jokes he's produced were like bad car wrecks. I didn't want to look but I had to. Thinking maybe each one would be better than the last; they couldn't get much worse. Of course this never happened.

Attack Force is the final straw. I will never rent his schlock again. He's a washed up has-been that can't even muster enough energy to use his own voice.

The story line was changed after all the scenes were shot for the movie which is why they got some guy to do a voice over for Seagal. A bad voice over, the guy doesn't sound like him at all. The director just ends this abomination for no apparent reason. Like others said, in Seagal's fight scenes you just see his head and hands moving in front of the camera. No shots of him using his whole body. They made sure to hide the body with a long black coat and dark scenes. Unbelievably bad.",1429833600,,627,4.064516129032258

2661198,1,B000ION79Y,"Steven Seagal plays Marshall Lawson, a commander of an elite military unit, in the 2008 direct-to-DVD Attack Force. While in Paris, three of his soldiers are brutally murdered in their hotel room. He starts his own investigation into their deaths with the help of his much younger girlfriend, Tia, and his military friend Dwayne. He learns that the soldiers deaths are linked to a military drug called CTX, in which Tia was one of the original scientist that helped create it. Whoever takes the CTX becomes an unstoppable killing machine.

I'm not the biggest Seagal fan and it has been awhile since I have seen one of his movies, but Attack Force has to be the worst. The plot is unrealistic and confusing. The fights scenes are ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and half of Seagal's lines are dubbed due to the script being changed after the movie was filmed. Attack Force is one of the worst movies ever made.",1352160000,,915,4.71875

2661225,2,B000ION79Y,"With a plot that is often difficult to make heads or tails of, Attack Force (2006) is one wacky and confusing adventure flick.  At times what happens is so ridiculously obtuse, that it is unintentionally humorous.  Action star Steven Seagal, does very little fighting until the very end.  Throughout the film, Seagal's voice annoyingly alternates between his own, and being dubbed by someone who sounds much older (reportedly Martin Sheen) and lacks Seagal's trademark drawl.

Marshall Lawson (Seagal), some kind of operative for the US government, is in Paris with his associate Dwayne (Davis Kennedy), preparing for some kind of mission.  Three new members of Lawson's unit visit a bar, and bring back a girl named Reina (Evelyne Armela O'Bami) to their hotel room.  Unfortunately instead of a night of fun, the men are murdered, and are apparently injected with CTX, an experimental drug that can make people hyper-violent.

Lawson's close friend Tia (Lisa Lovbrand) is a biochemist who happens to have worked on the development of CTX, together with a man named Aroon (Adam Croasdell), who has since ""defected"".  Aroon is the owner of the bar the soldiers visited, and has been testing CTX on his customers and employees, including Reina.

Aroon is working with a woman (credited as ""the Queen"" and played by Ileana Lazariuc) and has plans to release CTX into the city's water supply.  Lawson is working to prevent this, as well as track down the killer of his men.  Also in the picture are American naval intelligence, and the French police.

The pieces don't fit together very well, but it all builds up to a massive assault led by Lawson, who leads a convoy of military vehicles to a small village where Aroon is headquartered.  The action sequences, involving soldiers gunning down CTX infected civilians, are pretty appalling.  Lawson himself kills a couple who are dining, with rapid fire shots to the head.

The team proceeds to a church, where Aroon is processing the CTX.  One of the gimmicks featured in the film are blades attached to the wrists.  Using these weapons, Lawson battles Aroon and the Queen, who are both amped up on CTX.  Most of his fight with the Queen is shown in slow motion, with Seagal often waving his hands around ridiculously.  Lawson wounds the Queen in the chest, slashing her bra in half, but she manages to continue fighting without exposing her ample bloodstained breasts.  Seagal's fighting scenes come mostly at the very end, and are certainly far from his best work, although the nanographite wrist blades do deliver some nasty wounds.  Building quality in France must not be very good, as people keep crashing through walls.

A very ragged affair that fragments apart at the end, Attack Force is a blend of short action sequences, and a series of obscure meetings with pretentious dialog, that culminates with an insane military operation.  As the film concludes, Aroon has succeeded in contaminating the water supply with CTX, and Lawson's attack force is sadly reduced to just two men.  Sony Pictures apparently was unsure about the direction that Attack Force would ultimately take, and their decision is quite bad, as dozens of US troops lie dead on foreign soil, and some French citizens will soon be experiencing the wonders of CTX.  Though this disaster rates only 1.5 stars, and Seagal's performance is far from stellar, it may not be fair to blame him for matters that were out of his control.",1317254400,,3449,4.92560553633218
2661226,1,B000ION79Y,"This is so bad it shouldn't even be considered a movie. 1st 10 minutes of the production doesn't even make sense with Helicopters closing in on a military facility and Seagal driving a Hummer the ""bad guys"" open up with mini guns and kill everyone while the ""men in black"" (lower case) couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. ""Good guys"" couldn't just call ""men in black"" and warn them about pending doom?
""Bad guys"" pick up secret item, place it in hard plastic case and throw off the (black)covers on 2 motorcycles they just happen to sneak in out in the open. 1 guy gets killed by chopper (amazed you will be that it wasn't the guy carrying secret item) and ""Blade-That-Comes-Out-Of-Sleeve"" dude is off. Seagal gives chase because somehow he knows that this guy has the item, not the other guy that was killed. Machine gun from helicopter cannot target BTCOOS dude, but rocket brings him down. Amazingly it's right in front of second get--away vehicle! Cool, right? Seagal jumps out of Hummer and confronts BTCOOS dude in the woods even though we've just seen Seagals' Hummer driving past corrigated metal warehouse and *Wammo tASSY Bing Bhoff Hoe* the blade is in BTCOOS dudes forehead! SecretItem recovered.
What was that?............the rest of the movie? Ahh, no....i was only able to stand up until that part.",1278720000,,1324,4.760869565217392
2661227,1,B000ION79Y,"This was originally a SCI FI movie with Steven Seagal et al battling the hidden alien menace. Said aliens revealed only by their occasionally sideways blinking eyes and odd bits of wushu style wire work. All really low budget and I suspect a bit of a pile of steaming stinky as our man Steve is so laid back he's practically comatose and his action hero skit isn't helped by the spare tyre he's acquired over recent years. He clearly isn't bothereing, looks like he can't wait to hit the doughnut shop with his police buddies.
Then to cap it all after completion the producers decide to rework it as a modern terrorist movie about a spectacular drug plot, only there are a few MAJOR problems :-
1) New plot doesn't make any sense at all.
2) Alien special effects including sideways eyeblink left in, one hell of a narcotic.
3) New plot dialogue dubbed in by somebody who sounds almost entirely unlike Seagal, presumably cheaper and it really sucks big time.
4) Stupid continuity errors with fight wounds flipping from right side of victims chest to left then back again. It's also glaringly obvious to the casual viewer, this is not nerd stuff. Failure to pick it up is symptomatic of this slipshod, bone idle, crappy production.

If you want an example of how not to make a movie fine buy it. If you're looking for a Steven Seagal Movie forget it.",1278547200,,1348,4.570247933884297
2661228,1,B000ION79Y,"I love Steven Segal but I totally hate this gory, violent, bloody film!  It's the total opposite of Steven's best films. In other words, it's worse than a flop. Don't waste your time or money!",1261353600,,192,4.485714285714286
2661229,1,B000ION79Y,"Martin Sheen. That's right Seagal fans. It's Martin Sheen doing the dub for the lost audio.

There is really nothing much to keep your interest unless you like mildly entertaining bad French accents and the Martin Sheen voiceover. Too bad we couldn't have had the real Martin Sheen in this film to lend some star power, but it's the best we'll get. I can't do a bullet list of things to look out for because there just isn't anything. Even Seagal's extensive wardrobe of black (which he recycled from Into The Sun it seems) couldn't keep me amused for long. You can still cut cheese with his widow's peak but we sadly don't get to see it happen. It might have added some value to the film.  There is nearly zero entertainment value here. None. I thought Today You Die was bad, but at least that had some witty stilted jive inspired dialogue and something in the way of an ending.

I tried my best at highlighting some interesting things, but I could only 'force' up with a short paragraph:

A nonsense opening scene concerning some black box that has nothing to do with even setting Seagal up as a master fighter or soldier, guys getting thrown through paper mache walls and styrofoam pillars (lax French building codes) and surviving, Seagal sitting around for literally half the movie in a bar and no explanation as to why he's even in France, Seagal's government trying to kill him to get him to work with them (at least that's what it seemed like), the knife wound on the girl at the end switching sides and being able to clearly see her lying on the ground while Seagal is supposed to be fighting her...just some of the flaws in this film. The parts where there was action felt like I was watching a bad round of Modern Warfare 2; a bunch of faceless military guys creeping around and getting shot.

Definately one of the worst, if not THE worst Seagal film ever made.",1260921600,,1873,4.497058823529412

I'm a Steven Seagal fan, but this movie is so pathetic and sad!!! Absolutely no action at all!!! Seagal's lines are dubbed which stinks and the fight scenes are in slow motion. Avoid this Seagal movie like the plague!!! The only good thing in the film is the hot chick who kills people. Even when the killers murder people - the action is slowed down which means that it did not take place at all because we never actually see anyone get cut up!

The acting is terrible which is why Attack Farce is a complete joke! This film is more like a comedy man! I always laugh when I hear someone else dubbing Seagal's lines!!! lol. It is always halarious to hear different people do Seagal's lines & the people sound absolutely nothing like him!!!

This movie is a complete waste of time. I was fast forwarding most of the time. The final ""fight"" scene is so weak and lame.

Avoid this Seagal disaster and check out his better films such as: The Keeper, Out Of Reach, Kill Switch, Urban Justice, and Pistol Whipped.

2661231,1,B000ION79Y,"I just saw this movie, and in the very beginning, I hear Segal's charecter saying some lines which led me to believe there was going to be a sinister body double that was plotting against the good guy Segal.  I was shocked to realize that it was actually a voice dub!  I thought to myself, why would they voice over his original dialog, and why would they use another actor instead of having Segal do it.  Then I looked up the movie on Wikipedia and found out that there were script changes made after the movie was shot and the voice overs were made to compensate!  What a joke.  This movie sucks ass.  Steven, I think you need to go back to China or Japan or wherever you went to get your inspiration and meet up with your master again, or maybe go to a retreat in the Caribeaan and go on a macro-biotic diet for a few months!",1257724800,,828,4.176100628930818
2661232,2,B000ION79Y,"Despite the bad reviews, I decided to rent this one and see if it might make a good Sunday afternoon movie to nap too. However, the movie was so bad that I couldn't even sleep to it - LOL!! There is extensive dubbing of Seagal's voice, and the ""actor"" they got to dub Seagal's voice isn't even close. Not to mention that I'm not talking about his voice being dubbed when he's not facing the camera or something somewhat undetectable. There are 5-minute long conversations with the camera facing him where the entire conversation is dubbed. It's like watching some dubbed Asian flick from the 70's and not in a good way!! I'd say about 40% of his lines were dubbed in this way - really bad!!

The story seems interesting on the outset - a drug called CTX has the capacity to give people super-human strength, so the military is interested in it for their own purposes, there is a ""drug-cartel"" that is also interested in apparently trafficking the drug, there is a rogue military group interested in the drug, and the French police are investigating deaths as a result of the drug. However, the story doesn't really go anywhere from here and the scenes where people are fighting it out are so confusing you are not sure which group is killing which group, you just see that a bunch of people are dying.

The drug has a sort of side effect I guess which makes peoples eyes turn into something that looks like it was stolen from Men in Black. You know, where Will Smith's character chases that guy down on foot at the opening of the movie - remember that? And his eyes are like the gills on a fish, blinking. That was okay though. What was really funny is that the drug also makes people have a metal knife that protrudes from their hand, which they use to slice open their victims. How exactly does that happen?! How does a drug make you grow a metal knife shaped object coming out of your hand? LOL, stupid!!

The ending was really bad - of course there is a big fight and everyone dies but Seagal and his little Japanese sidekick, but so what! Does that mean the military has given up on trying to kill Seagal? Earlier in the movie he killed a similar kind of military death squad and they just sent another death squad after him. So now that he killed this second squad, they are just going to give up?! The whole part about Seagal's character being part of the ""good military"" and the ""bad military"" was trying to kill him, was a little ridiculous and hard to follow.

You don't see Seagal using any of his Aikido really, it's just fake digitally-enhanced fighting scenes, though there were a couple of decent military-style shoot-outs. But overall this was one of the worst Seagal flicks I've ever seen, though still better than ""Kill Switch"" or ""Against the Dark."" But I'm guessing this is one Seagal would like to have back or at least take his name off of, then again sometimes I think it's just a paycheck for him and he really doesn't care anymore.",1252195200,,2956,4.468518518518518
2661233,3,B000ION79Y,"After watching Into the Sun earlier we had the opportunity to make it a double feature Saturday when Attack force also came on tv hours later. Being the Seagal fans we are this was an opportunity we simply couldn't pass up. It kind of felt like an old school Saturday when we used to spend our evening watching some hilarious flicks, except 2 key members were missing. None the less it brought Sid's mind back to the good old days which is always a welcomed occasion.

In Attack force Seagal plays Marshall Lawson and has unleashed his finest mullet to date. This thing is good, we want to be friends with it. It pretty much looks like his ponytail also gained weight forcing to stretch wide for a full mullet/Myers effect that cannot be contained. Aside from his mullet Marshall lost his strike force/competitive eating team by a group of government tested freaks. Marshall discovers the military secret and has to take on the US army along with the super warriors in a battle royal of hilarious proportions. Throughout the film there is a very strange dubbed effect going on. Sometimes Seagal's mouth will be moving but a different voice is heard not matching up with his lips. The voice sounds nothing like Seagals, much like the Pesci voice in the edited tv version of Casino. Awesome! 1 star right there for it's b dubbed goodness. You can tell a lot of effort went into this one.

Attack force earned itself 3 stars in our eyes despite mostly terrible reviews from the masses. Both this and Into the Sun got bashed but actually turned out to be pretty entertaining. You just have to love what Steven has become. He has pretty much become the obese version of Johnny Cash because he wears black everything in every movie he's done since the early 2000's. At least he was somewhat understandable despite the dubbed issue. Try to watch anything he does now and you'll need to hire a translator to understand anything he say.

I see by the DVD case this is a United Kingdom-Romania production.  Some of the actors are not speaking English and are dubbed over in English.  That, of course, is fine and well done.
Apparently the voice of Steven Seagal was accidentally erased during this process in some places and dubbed over with a voice that does not even attempt to mimic Mr. Seagal.

2661237,1,B000ION79Y,"Traditionally, reaction to Steven Seagal's DTV releases is a mixed bag.

Basically, each of Seagal's films has its fans and haters, no matter how bad or good it is. However, if there is a film of which the quality almost all Seagal devotees agree on, it's ""Attack Force"" - a sloppy, long-winded mess that highlights just about all of our hero's faults and inefficiencies.

Trying to explain the plot is a chore within itself, so here's the barest rendition: Seagal is the leader of a military strike team that gets wiped out in Paris by a prostitute juiced up on CTX - a drug that turns anybody into a vicious, remorseless killing machine. Upon finding out that CTX is funded by the military, Seagal must evade assassination from the inside whilst leading another team to stop the drug from being released into the city water supply.

Like I mentioned before, the film encompasses everything that critics like to sneer at Seagal for: in addition to the plot that quickly descends into something totally incomprehensible (did anybody besides me realize that the ending offers absolutely no resolution?), the film's production is dark and dreary, the fight choreography is lacklustre, and Seagal is out-of-shape, uninspired in his acting, and has large portions of his voice dubbed by another actor. That last aspect is what really breaks the movie: in the past, small segments of the aikido master's dialogue have been voiced over in post-production, but in ""Attack Force"", roughly half of the film sees Seagal's lines being dubbed by someone who sounds only vaguely like him. This is done so obviously - even when Seagal is in clear sight and his lips do not match the words heard by audiences - that casual viewers will begin to wonder what the heck is going on. (supposedly this is because the film's storyline was altered during post-production after Seagal's scenes were shot; the original plot featured Seagal battling aliens)

So, with a storyline that few will be able to follow and a star who is not speaking for himself, we fall back on a handful of braindead action scenes, a supporting cast that never believes in the script in the first place and whose biggest star is Dwayne Dixon from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reign-of-Fire/dp/B00006JDVV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reign of Fire</a>, sets so consistently dark that viewers who keep watching will end up depressed, and Seagal feeding his ego by smooching Lisa ""Tia"" Lovnrand, who looks to be about thirty years younger than him. The issue of the fight scenes is particularly lamentable, since at one point we see Seagal donning wrist-mounted blades to fight his foes; capitalizing on something cool like this could have potentially saved the film from complete oblivion, but sadly, we're treated to short, quick-cut fights that are less frequent than the uninspired shootouts.

Needless to say, this is probably the lowest that Seagal can afford to sink before even small-name studios stop putting him in their films. Watching a film like ""Attack Force"" can make you wonder if this is really the same man whose most successful film grossed over $156 million fifteen years ago and who has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Tommy Lee Jones and Kurt Russell. ""Attack Force"" is by no means a must-watch, even for Seagal fans, and it is sure to grace the collections of only the most die-hard of devotees.",1210982400,,4088,5.763245033112582

Yes the voice dubbing was so obvious and dorky (did Steven's original audio input get corrupted, lost, or what).

Everything regarding the plot was so predictable, which at times I can live with, but not this one.  It was pathetic.  And whats up with with Steven.  He looks so out of shape, to the point of looking sickly overweight - very sluggish, except for later when the editors sped up or enhanced the action to gloss over what looks like a very tired and chunky Steven Seagal.  I hope he gets help with whatever illness or malady that he may have.  What a waste of precious time watching this movie.

Apparently they filmed the vast majority of the movie and then changed the plot.

One of the most disconcerting aspect of the movie is that they dubbed over Segal's voice for about 1/3 of the movie. The voice they used is not even remotely close to Segal's voice. So I was totally confused. Why was he talking like that? Was it him talking? Who was talking? Gaaah! Absolutely maddening.

I've been a martial artist since the 70s and appreciate realism. Seagal is an Akido master and had all the right moves as well as actually being a gun enthusiast. Watching him handle a weapon was much more realistic than most of the other inept Hollywood actors that only have a basic clue which end the bullet comes out of.

I don't recall the names of the last two or three movies (Submerged was one) but my wife and I agreed they were extremely sub-par for him. I keep giving him chances because I like him but Attack Force was the last straw. We rented it and actually stopped it last night in the middle of the film so I could do a Google search to see if any information was out on it. The Google search lead me to Amazon where I read the reviews and noted that almost everyone was disappointed, with good reason.

Come on Steven, get on the treadmill, reopen a dojo, do some deep meditation and get back with someone that knows how to produce movies. Almost the entire movie was filmed at night and hard to see - intentional, I believe to hide inadequacies. Hardly any martial arts by Segal and the realism was just missing.

2661281,1,B000ION79Y,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I've been a fan of Steven Seagal's since Above the Law came out in the late 80's.  I've enjoyed most of his American made films right up to Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds.  When Seagal severed his relationship with long-time production partner, Jules Nasso, and then Warner Brothers ended its relationship with our martial arts hero, the quality of Seagal's movies went downhill rather quickly as did his salary.  He dropped from making sixteen million a movie to a little over two million a picture.  In other words, to keep up his high standards of living, he now has to do four-to-five movies a year just to equal what he used to make on one Warner Brothers' picture.  Part of this is due to the increase in age (he's now 55) and weight (at least eighty-to-a-hundred pounds overweight for his height of 6' 4"") and his inability to do the fighting scenes that made him famous almost twenty years ago.  Add all of the above to bad directing, terrible scripts, and poor photography, and you have an actor who's barely hanging on to his career.  I have to also say that Seagal isn't the only actor who's had to resort to making films almost entirely in Europe.  Wesley Snipes has found himself in the same boat (though he could be avoiding the IRS) and so has Sylvester Stallone (Sly, however, is making a comeback with Rocky Balboa and a fourth ""Rambo"" film due out this summer).  And, like many of the other people who've reviewed Attack Force, I, too, keep hoping for a really good ""Seagal"" film that will display his talents as they used to be in his earlier movies.  Unfortunately, unlike the other reviewers, I didn't just buy Attack Force, I also purchased Today You Die at the same time.  I should've read the reviews first, but I didn't, and now I'm stuck with two clunkers.  Stupid me!!!

Attack Force has Steven Seagal playing Marshall Lawson, the commander of a strike-force team, somewhat like Delta Force.  At the beginning of the movie, Lawson's team is almost completely wiped out at a night meeting.  Then, a little later, three of his remaining soldiers are murdered in their hotel room by a psycho bitch high on a new type of drug that has turned her into a killing machine with abnormal strength and reflexes, not to mention a strange pupil dilation that causes her eyes to look like those of a werewolf.  Now, as it turns out, this new drug is being developed by the United States to create a superior fighting soldier.  Because of Lawson's involvement due to the death of his men, certain members of the government decide to have him eliminated so that the cat isn't let out of the bag, but it's now too late.  More people have been infected with the drug than first realized and the government has to put them down before a mass epidemic of murder starts taking place in the French countryside.  Lawson is the only man who can do it, so he's chosen to lead a new strike force.  I think this kind of sums up the plot.  I'm not entirely sure because I was somewhat confused throughout the movie.  I didn't always know who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.  Example: Was the French detective a good or bad guy?  I don't know.  I suspect that this was a plot device designed to keep the viewer on his toes so that he wouldn't fall asleep due to movie-induced boredom.  .

I'm now trying to think of something good to say about the movie, but nothing comes to mind except that the women in the film looked beautiful and deadly.  Steven Seagal likes to surround himself with beautiful women in his movies, and I don't blame him.  After all, he was one of the producers on this film.  I wonder if he pulled another ""Jenny McCarthy"" with them and made each potential female star take off her blouse so that he could check out her talent as an actress.  Oh, here's the big standout about the movie.  Mr. Seagal's voice was dubbed over dozens of times during the film.  Like one of the other critics, I originally thought something was wrong with my DVD and checked the ""Language"" section on the menu.  Nothing wrong there.  The only thing I can think of is that after the movie was completed, the director discovered that Seagal's voice didn't come through in every scene and so it had to be dubbed in certain places.  Also, because the drug-induced villains moved so fast and looked so strange, I thought at first that maybe Attack Force was a horror movie.  I mean a French undercover cop would be faced with a killer-crazed woman with weird eyes.  He'd turn around to run away and then she'd be standing in that direction, waiting for him.  I don't know of any drug that can make a person move with the speed of light.  Not only could these people move fast, but they also had super human strength.  They could knock a person through three walls instead of just one.  That's one hard punch.  Even Bruce Lee couldn't do that!  I guess the victims had super human strength, too, because they'd get right back up and try to defend themselves against these killing machines.  If I got knocked through three walls, I'd still be lying there unconscious, or else I'd play like I was unconscious so I wouldn't get killed.  The movie was filmed almost entirely at night, which made the action extremely hard to follow.  Maybe that was for the best.  Steven Seagal does very little fighting in the movie till the very end and then it's against a beautiful babe in leather shorts.  I wish I could make a living doing that!  By the way, at the end when the new strike force goes after these voracious killers, each member is picked off one by one just like in the usual ""teen-murder"" flicks.  Rather than sticking close together, the strike force makes the mistake of letting each other out of sight for a few moments, thereby enabling the enemy to kill them.  The only one who acts with any common sense is Seagal's sidekick, Na-boo, who stays glued to him like a new wife, while keeping a sharp eye out for anyone trying to sneak up behind them.  That was kind of funny to watch.  I guess this is the best that we can now expect from Steven Seagal.  He'll be sixty in a few years and doing wine commercials like the late Orson Wells.  I certainly don't anticipate his future movies getting any better.  I feel like everyone else in that I should've rented this film, instead of buying the damn thing.  Of course, I bought two clunkers, instead of one, so I've really learned my lesson this time around.  I'm now marking Steven Seagal (7th Degree Black Belt in Aikido, guitar player, director, producer, writer, former Tibetan monk in a previous lifetime, former husband of Kelly Le Brock, former C.I.A. operative, and who knows what else) off of my to-buy list.

What a mistake. When I heard the voice emanating from the screen in the first five minutes, I had to do a double-take. It wasn't even in a close proximity to seagal's voice. I actually stopped the video and checked the dubbing to make sure it wasn't being dubbed over in English from another language. It was more like a very bad old Japanese film as the voice and lip sync was totally off. Plot?  What plot? Nothing went together. Nothing made sense. Seagal's cute blonde companion made it from location-to-location in the blink of an eye, and she was on everyone's side. What was THAT all about? Special effects? Probably the best was making seagal look less bloated and slow in several scenes than he really is. I think I've learned my lesson - finally. I'm done with the Seagal movies.

I don't know how he could let this movie out. Bad plot, Bad dubbed Steven's voice (for no reason)...This is the worst movie I've ever watched!",1167177600,,310,4.362068965517241
2661295,1,B000ION79Y,"When I reviewed ""Mercenary for Justice"", I said that was the worst Seagal movie since ""The Foreigner"". ""Attack Force"" is no better. The movie tries to be part action movie and part horror movie, and ends up being neither. Apparently, it's not only Avi Lerner and the other producers at Millennium/Nu Image that can make greenlight scripts with completely incoherent plots.

The movie is not likely to appeal to action movie fans, nor to horror movie fans. That leaves only one potential target audience: Steven Seagal fans. The problem is that Steven Seagal does not have all that much screen time, and when he does, he's just sitting around looking tired. As if that's not bad enough, about half of his dialogue is dubbed over by another actor. So Steven Seagal fans are likely to feel cheated after wasting their money on this movie.

The only people who should even consider wasting their time on this movie are die hard Steven Seagal fans, and even they would be wise to rent the movie instead of buying it.",1166572800,,1011,4.706214689265536
2661296,3,B000ION79Y,"Right up there with other former box office superstars such as Van Damme, Norris, Lungren and Snipes. It would seem that one can make more money producing STV movies with good production instead of waiting for a theater release that might never come again.

Other than the obvious dubbing of Seagals voice, this wasn't any better or worse then most Seagal movies.

I wouldn't mind seeing more gratuitous nudity or even meaningless sex in his movies, but I'll take what I can from Seagal.

One more thing, the singing thing isn't working...........stick to movies.",1166486400,2,563,4.968085106382978
2661297,1,B000ION79Y,I am also a huge Seagal fan and rented this one.  I also don't understand why they dub his voice.  If they didn't dub his voice I would have much more respect for him.,1166313600,2,167,3.8823529411764706
2661298,1,B000ION79Y,"I'm in total agreement with other reviews read regarding this movie! I think Steven Segal has seen his days and should have given up movie making a long time ago. His last few releases were pretty bad, but this one was the worst I've seen! He was never much of an actor to begin with, but as an action movie fan, I had purchased all of his movies. This one will be my last!

Recent releases shows that he is doing less and less 'acting' (if you even want to call it acting), looking like he has gained 50 pounds, trying to cover it up with his long trench coats, unable to do 'any' of his own stunts anymore. What is even worse is that it is so obvious! You would think that with today's special effects, cameras, and other means, they could make a movie where this isn't so obvious.

Steven Segal had already proven that he can beat up on women, for those that didn't hear about his domestic battery charge from the past, but it would seem that he can't even beat up on the 'bad guys' anymore! Thanks goodness for stunt doubles!

I would tend to guess that the biggest part of the budget for this movie, (besides his salary), was for stunt doubles that has to do all his work for him these days. I guess he figures that just his name is going to carry him into more movie making... not after this movie!

His status as an 'actor' is such that his movies aren't even hitting the theaters. They go straight from poor editing and the cutting room floor to DVD.

And this movie should have stayed on the cutting room floor! Not only did the plot of the movie suck, but it was hard to follow, and I would say that a third to half of the movie had that dubbed voice issue that other reviewers commented on. And it wasn't even close! I guess there wasn't enough room in the budget to hire a good impersonator...

I also agree with the comment being the entire movie being shot in such a dark setting. Where they trying to save money on lighting, or covering up for Steven Segal's weight gain, and the use of a lot of stunt doubles?

Then there is Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, the distributor of this DVD, that I had talked to personally. Who at Sony decided to even accept the distribution of this so-called movie? Who ever it was, should be fired!

They commented that they received countless complaints about this movie already. That the dubbed voice of Steven Segal was in no way any part of Sony's involvement in this movie. That it was the decision of the producers and director of the movie to release it as it is, a poor quality, badly made movie that was only going to sell because it had a picture of Steven Segal on the cover.

I got the impression that Sony will eventually drop distribution of this title like a hot potato, so check out the $5.99 bins at Wal-mart if you really want this title, as it probably won't be in print very long! Personally, if I had seen it before I spent $20.00 for it, I wouldn't have even bought it at $5.99.

It's no wonder that all his new releases are never discounted like other new releases that hit the store shelves on Tuesdays. He has no market potential any more.

To Steven Segal, GIVE IT UP! You're a 'has been' that can't realize that your time is past. Oh... and by the way, why don't you take some of that money you milked off those people that bought this 'dog', and get a haircut! That rat's nest hanging down the back of your neck 'really' looks stupid, and needs to get chopped off! And save up some of that money for a larger trench coat... it looks like you'll be needing it. The one you have been wearing isn't covering it all up anymore!

I think the biggest problem with Steven Segal is that he has been playing such roles for so long, I actually think he believes he some sort of indestructible, militaristic, C.I.A., super spook!",1166140800,3,3795,4.307152875175316
2661299,1,B000ION79Y,"I agree with the other review. This is one of the worst Segal films of all time. HIS VOICE WAS DUBBED in parts of the movie!!!! In one scene you hear his voice and in another it is the voice that sounds like a totally different person. I was so astounded that I called a friend and played it for him over the phone. The content is a combination of a bad horror film and his recent film, Mercenary. I loved the old Segal in Out For Justice in which he used a cue ball wrapped in a bar towel to knock the teeth out of some convict in a bar! I have even come to like some of his new films, like Shadow Man. BUT this is the worst! There are fans out there like me that will rent any Segal film. BUT this was too much!",1166140800,2,713,3.824324324324324
2661300,1,B000ION79Y,"As someone else has said, ""Too bad there isn't a rating less than 1 star"".

It's pretty bad when Segal is too self important or lazy (take your pick) to do the post edit audio dubs that are needed. To make it worse, they used at least 3 different voices for the voice overs.

I've been a Segal fan for years, but this is the last one of his films that I will waste my time watching. I'm just glad that I chose to rent it instead of buying it.

Overall, the whole movie is awful. From the bad acting to Segals pseudo, badly done fight scenes. In the last fight scene when Segal is fighting a female ""bad guy"", her wound keeps changing from her left to her right side. Looks like the editors fell asleep while they were trying to make heads or tails of this fiasco.

Can't believe that Sony actually allowed their name to be associated with this one.",1165968000,5,848,4.184049079754601

2661302,1,B000ION79Y,"Steven Seagal needs to preview his new films before releasing them. The script was unbelievable. In one Segal was speaking but it wasn't his voice. Steven, I believe it's time to retire. Over weight too much black hair die.",1165795200,3,223,4.743589743589744
