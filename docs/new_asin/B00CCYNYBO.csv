5715565,3,B00CCYNYBO,"I don't think that there are any really bad episodes of Maverick, but some are much better than others. I want all the episodes, but after purchasing the first two seasons, I see that the next three are available. I'm afraid to purchase them, then find that a complete set is available in a couple of months, at a lower price. I've seen this happen so many times before, that I'm slow to buy new collections of tv shows.",1397692800,2,420,4.329113924050633
5715566,4,B00CCYNYBO,"Season 4 is not the best season of Maverick as there is no more James Garner, and the plots are thinner than previous years.  However Roger Moore and Jack Kelly are very watchable in the roles.

A real bonus is the superb quality of the DVDs, and also that these episodes have not been available for about 50 years.

I look forward to the last 13 episodes of series 5.",1395619200,8,368,4.228571428571429
5715567,5,B00CCYNYBO,"I won't repeat what I said for the Maverick Season 3 box regarding the pricing.  The price gouging policy of Time Warner is true here as well.

The series Maverick was created by writer Roy Huggins for James Garner.  When Warner Bros. found that they could not produce at the rate of an episode a week, Jack Kelly was brought on board to ease everyone's burden.

Garner's leaving the show after Season 3 gave the general public the impression that the show would not be very good anymore.  However, in my view the shows of Season 4 are entirely satisfactory, and well worth seeing.

Moore left after Season 4.  The scripts of Season 5 were quite mediocre, and the show was deservedly cancelled at its conclusion.",1393459200,8,712,4.603174603174603
5715568,5,B00CCYNYBO,"Okay it is expensive, but i wanted to see roger moore in this series as he is one of my favorite actors and now i have watched some of the episodes i am pleased i purchsed it. picture and sound quality is excellent as in series 1&2. when you want something bad enough you will pay the price, this is why i have not purchsed series 3 i will wait until the price comes down. I do not want it bad enough to pay that price.",1392940800,9,419,3.883720930232558
5715569,5,B00CCYNYBO,"As with Season 3, the WB Shop is offering this on pressed DVD's (not DVD-Rs) for the first printing----But only if you buy from them direct. Of course, it's overpriced but----if I'm going to pay too much----I'd rather pay it for pressed DVDs (that will last) rather than DVD'Rs (that won't). There is a coupon code to save $10 off of a $50 order DEALS10 . Maverick- Season 4 is just 5 cents under $50. If you pick something cheap from the sale section you can use the coupon and still end up under $50. I hope they'll release Season 5 on pressed discs too!

EDIT---UPDATE---February .13. 2015---Coupon codes for the WB Shop are getting scarcer and scarcer----I can occasionally find a $10 off of $50 but it doesn't usually work on discounted or Archive titles.  Now that the minimum for free shipping has been raised from $45 to $75 it makes any $10 off of $50 coupons I can find effectively $10 off of $75 or $5 off of $50 (once you deduct the $5 shipping charge).

The WB Shop is having a SALE for the Valentine's Day weekend.  Sale ends February 16, 2015 at 11:59 PM, PST. They are offering.......$5 off of $25, .......$15 off of $60 ........and $30 off of $100......... This is a very good deal for their replicated/pressed disc box sets as they are already 20% off.  I have checked the sale and everything I've tried has worked---- You can put other Archive sets than those listed under the Valentine's Day sale section---- you can combine Archive titles with titles from their regular sale section and the discount still applies. No coupon code is needed the discount applies automatically at checkout. The $30 off of $100 is the best deal (as long as you wish to buy that much) as it is not only the biggest discount but you have to get to $75 to get free shipping.

If you already own all five seasons of `Maverick', you may wish to consider the spin-off `Bret Maverick' or `Nichols' both of which star James Garner. All four seasons of `Sugarfoot' are available in this sale---- no dedicated `Maverick' fan would want to be without season one of `Sugarfoot' because of certain guest appearances----need I say more? Also, seasons one, two and three of `Bronco' are now available. Seasons four onwards of `Cheyenne' are available as replicated/pressed discs (season one is available as replicated/pressed regular (non- Archive) Warner release).

I have no idea whether most fans of `Maverick' also like pre-codes----I do anyway----Pre-codes are films that were made between 1929 through mid-1934 before the Hays production code went into effect----There is the `William Powell at Warner Bros' set (all pre-codes) and Volumes 5, 6, 7 & 8 of the Warner pre-code series `Forbidden Hollywood' are available as replicated/pressed discs (volume 4 is out of print and only available as DVD-R----volumes 1, 2, & 3 are still available as regular (non- Archive) Warner releases).

Please not that I am still not sure whether `Bret Maverick' is or is not produced as replicated/pressed discs----I think it is but I can not be sure----all the others I have mentioned are replicated/pressed discs.

EDIT--UPDATE---February .19. 2014---  As of posting, the WB Shop is still offering Maverick Season 3 on pressed DVD's (not DVD-Rs)----But, again, only if you buy from them direct. If you want both 3 & 4 you can use the code SAVINGS for $20 off a $100 order. Seasons 3 & 4 are both 5 cents under $50 each----If you pick something cheap from the sale section you can use the coupon and still end up under $100.  Be sure to check out through the WB Shop NOT the Warner Archive shop because the coupon code will not work through the Warner Archive shop.

To confirm that these are still available as pressed (replicated) discs-- go to WB Shop then click Warner Archive then click Replicated Discs on the sidebar on the left.
This will show you all the Warner Archive titles currently available on pressed (replicated) discs. As of 2012 Warner Archive has stated that they will be releasing all sets of 3 discs or more on pressed (replicated) discs first (again, only when purchased from the WB Shop direct and only while supplies last---after that they will switch to DVD-R).

FOR THOSE OUTSIDE THE U.S.----
Unfortunately, the WB Shop does not ship out side the U.S.  However, for those that live outside the U.S. that want pressed/replicated discs there are some possible solutions.---- When Warner Archive releases a title on pressed discs they ship it out to other retailers----mostly---though not completely----as pressed discs. Thus, as long as Warner Archive is showing a title as available in their Replicated Discs section you are likely to receive pressed/replicated discs when ordering from another store. Many people have ordered Warner Archive sets from Movies Unlimited (ships to Canada and International) and received pressed/replicated discs. Also, many people have ordered Warner Archive sets from Import CDs (ships to Canada and International) and received pressed/replicated discs. From what I understand, the success rate of receiving pressed/replicated Warner Archive sets from Import CDs is, perhaps, not quite as high. However, as the prices at Import CDs are certainly not as high------you may decide it's worth the risk!

The reason why, when ordering from Amazon, you receive DVD-R's is that Amazon themselves manufactures the MOD (made on demand) products that they sell. This creates problems because Amazon downloads the content from online. There are often authoring problems---such as skips, glitches, ect. That's why if I buy a DVD that is only available on MOD/DVD-R I make sure that I buy it direct from the company or from a store that has. ----That way I make sure that it has been authored in the best way possible. It's true that, sometimes, even Amazon receives shipments of pressed/replicated Warner Archive sets. Some people have actually received pressed/replicated Warner Archive sets when purchasing from Amazon. However, that is the exception rather than the rule and is, I think,----even as an exception---becoming less common than before. It isn't very tempting to try to order from Amazon, anyway, as they have the highest price around right now.
Trying to get pressed/replicated Warner Archive sets out of Amazon would be pretty risky gambling----and remember----gambling is one thing Pappy told you to avoid!

HOW TO TELL IF YOU HAVE PRESSED/REPLICATED DISCS OR DVD-Rs

PRESSED/REPLICATED DVDs are always silver on the playing side. (That is, the side that you put face-down in to your player not the side with the title/art.)

DVD-Rs are never silver on the playing side. The playing side of a DVD-R is purple----the lighter the shade of purple, the higher the quality of the disc. For instance, Warner Archive DVD-Rs are a pale lilac/violet colour.",1392163200,44,6788,4.955145118733509

5715590,4,B00CCYNYBO,Season four starts with Roger Moore added as cousin Beau.  This season James Garner exited from the show.  Also Robert Colbert was added as another Maverick brother Brent.  These changes helped some what but you could see that the series was slated to be cancelled.  The plots and acting made this season hold its own with the Nielsen ratings.

5715599,3,B00CCYNYBO,"James Garner is Maverick. Without him the show just isn't the same. Apparently Warner Brothers hoped Roger Moore would be ""James Garner with a British accent"" but it didn't work out that way. I have all 4 seasons of Maverick and the first 3 seasons with Garner are the best. Once he left the show it declined noticeably. In fact the stories became silly and boring. Jack Kelly is good but what made the show work was the contrast between Bret (Garner) and Bart (Kelly). Having a British cousin (Moore) suddenly show up out of nowhere in season 4 and be expected to carry half the episodes, which he doesn't do very well, is a big disappointment. And then Moore left after only half of one season's episodes and didn't return for season 5, which was the final one. It only ran half the season before it was cancelled. The fact that the show could carry on for only one & a half seasons after Garner left tells us all we need to know. As I said James Garner is Maverick. Without him the show isn't really worth watching anymore. I don't expect to add season 5 to my collection.",1413936000,10,1075,4.38

5715605,4,B00CCYNYBO,"The year without James Garner.  Not bad on reflection.  Roger Moore takes over as cousin Beau, but even he quit half way through the season.  The problem is not Maverick but Warner Bros.  They had many TV series during this time period but felt it was beneath them to have TV shows instead of movies!  Typical attitude by the major studios during those day even though they were big hits.  So, to save money they would reuse scripts from the various shows and just change the names and locale and move the contract actors from series to series.  No wonder many of them walked out.  They even tried another brother who looked and dressed like Bret.  It did not work.

The good news is that the shows, alternating with Bart, are not bad at all.",1405728000,6,742,4.42962962962963
5715606,5,B00CCYNYBO,James garner was always great in the role but Jack kelly also kept it entertaining and humorous.,1404604800,5,96,4.705882352941177
5715607,5,B00CCYNYBO,"Maverick is not as good without James Garner, but still enjoyable. Too bad they couldn't agree, but I understood Garner's reason.",1401926400,2,129,5.190476190476191
5715608,5,B00CCYNYBO,"The Mavericks have a few things in common with James Bond: both take card games seriously and both enjoy the company of women. The Mavericks, as a rule, don't like to fight, and certainly would not accept any damn license to kill.

Most times, the personalities of the Mavericks are laid back, and that suits Roger Moore fine. He's certainly believable as a Maverick, except for the fact that no one has made mention of him in the previous three years, which takes getting used to, and is now os the prime center of attention whenever Bart refers to a relative. It's as if he forgot he had a brother named Bret.

It should be noted before I charge into the individual episodes of the fourth season, that with Moore or without, Maverick always had a formidable goal to try to achieve.

The challenge that Maverick had to meet week after week is: How to be Maverick?

Even with James Garner, it was not easy living up to the unique tone and spirit of Maverick.

There's much more in my full review of the 4th year of Maverick
in the new Riding Shotgun column on Comicsbulletin.com,
including many photos, including sequential sequences.
Even some photos of Edd Byrnes and
77 Cherokee Strip.
For Maverick fans, fans thinking of buying this set, and for those
interested in reading some tidbits about what was happening behind
the scenes.
Hang in there!
