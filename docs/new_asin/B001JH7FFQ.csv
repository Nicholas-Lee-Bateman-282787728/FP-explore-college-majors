8312888,2,B001JH7FFQ,Material is an update for experienced users not for newbies.  No information on how to structure the rograms to get the smooth transitions shown nor on how to get any real help.  Definately needs more information on Premere.  The material is well and entertaingly presented but doesn't really address enough indepth inforamation for the experienced user or enough basic information for a new user.,1254096000,,397,5.171875
8312889,5,B001JH7FFQ,"I bought the Class on Demand Basic Training for Adobe CS4 Production Premium and I love it!

It is affordable and provides more information about how to use the software then any classroom training could possibly offer. Adobe software can be very daunting, but I feel much more comfortable and confident using them after I have used Class on Demand's trainings. This edition is no different. Tim Kolb, the instructor, is incredibly easy to follow and explains all the ins and outs of the software. While most other trainings or ""how-to"" books can cost a lot of money, this DVD not only is interactive and detailed in ways that books are not, but the cost is also much better and worth it. I have recommended this training to many of my friends and colleagues already and I would recommend it to everyone out there that wants to learn how to use the software without having to sweat through the process of self-teaching.",1236038400,2,919,4.672839506172839
