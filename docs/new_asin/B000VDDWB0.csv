8218319,5,B000VDDWB0,We actually have one of these (a panorame with film in it) in our museum!  So getting the history in visual form was wonderful.  Covers the subject and answers our questions.,1447891200,,174,4.580645161290323
8218320,4,B000VDDWB0,"American taverns in the 1940s usually had neon-decorated jukeboxes that played 78s. Roomier ""joints"" often provided entertainment from an icebox-sized machine called a Panoram. For a certain amount of coin, patrons could both listen to and watch songs performed by their favorite artists. This ingenious monster contained numerous film loops deliverable on demand to a projector and shown via mirrors and rear projection on an opaque glass screen. After WWII, the Panoram was superseded by a new device: television.

8218321,4,B000VDDWB0,"I enjoyed this - not just a collection of ""soundies"" but has documentary information.  If you just want collections of clips (as videos to scroll through), don't buy this.  But if you want some great footage with some context, very enjoyable.",1228867200,3,242,4.878048780487805
8218322,3,B000VDDWB0,"One may not care for the dialouge and interviews, I, in fact, found them interesting. However, the music, while not DTS or Doby 5.1,  is very good and the sound is very good.  As a historical musical and visual document on jazz and what was called rock and roll this DVD is great.

8218323,4,B000VDDWB0,"This is a documentation on music and a way a media (the music clips) sold it. Very informative and interesting to see big stars in the beginning of their careers, and there isn't a better choice than Michael Feinstein as the host. - Regarding the previous comments, if you would have checked out the product more carefully, you would have known what you were buying. Especially you people in the States know what PBS is all about, high quality enter-/intotainment, even education.",1196726400,6,480,4.865853658536586
8218324,1,B000VDDWB0,"Amazon ""spammed"" my email encouraging me to buy this disc which is too bad because this disc is absolutely horrid. This DVD has talking through all the cuts....shame on Amazon.....I feel used...and stupid.....",1192233600,20,209,5.363636363636363
8218325,1,B000VDDWB0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. This is a PBS special, and the Soundies are constantly interrupted by talking heads or narration, or are truncated. What could've been a great release -- uncut, restored music videos of a bygone era -- instead becomes one of the worst, most disappointing DVDs of the year. I'm returning mine for a refund.",1192060800,36,335,5.0
