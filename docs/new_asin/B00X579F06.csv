At first I wondered, ""Is this going to be about women who are dancers?"" but then the interviews broadened to a variety of women focused on many other life works.  The feeling throughout, while watching this, is of an uplifting energy and it is an incredibly positive experience.
If you are a woman, this is a documentary that will be inspiring.  This would be perfect if you want to invite a couple friends over and watch together.
Share this film - it would make a lovely gift too for the friend in your life with spiritual leanings.",1501891200,,608,4.611111111111111

I love how each of the women in this film have stepped into their light and are sharing their unique gifts with the world.  It takes great courage to do so but it is what the world needs today; we need the divine feminine to reign it's beauty, sensuality and intelligence. Bravo!",1470096000,,383,4.536231884057971
