8546081,5,B00A1Q0S3M,My toddlers love Stella and Sam. This DVD box set contained many of their favorite episodes and provided us a bonus cd so they could hear their favorite songs when not watching the video. Stella and Sam are a younger brother and sister that go on adventures with their dog Fred. Definitely an enjoyable series that even I enjoy watching.,1497225600,,337,4.633333333333334

8546084,5,B00A1Q0S3M,"My preschool age niece and nephew love this show. As a product of Canada, It is not easy to find on TV in our area. I particularly love the characters and message of this series.  The stories focus on big sister Stella encouraging little brother Sam to use his imagination and dream big. Stella opens up the world to Sam and his friend through imaginative play. The episodes are calm and yet hold the attention of little ones. Perfect bedtime or nap time viewing.  This version comes in French and English you choose.  A great series for preschoolers teaching cooperation, imagination and caring. A great alternative to the fast paced cartoons and the antithesis of Caillou.",1483833600,2,674,4.793103448275862

8546086,5,B00A1Q0S3M,Best brother/sister show next to Peppa Pig. This program had a very kind and nurturing big sister to a sweet younger brother. I absolutely love the tenderness that is conveyed but also the imagination that only young kids would appreciate.,1462060800,3,239,5.0
