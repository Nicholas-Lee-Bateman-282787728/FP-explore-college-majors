8146247,5,B000IMNQWY,"I really enjoyed Vol. 1 of the Global Adventure series DVD that I had been fortunate enough to find at a garage sale. But I was dissapointed when it ended and then I knew right away I had to have Vol. 2. Well,To AMAZON I did go & was pleased at the price. I'm on disability & cannot afford or in well enough cndition to tour or travel but really enjoy entertaining myself by traveling on my HDTV. Asia the gal that takes you to these countries on the DVD is fun to watch & is entertaining and realistic on what her adventures mean to her & explains quite a bit on the cultures & history along the way. Made me feel like I was right there on the trip also. But with my comforts of home. I highly reccomend thid DVD & I'm quite sure I'll travel often with Asia.",1377993600,,759,4.033112582781457

She's there to discover and to learn, which makes this little-known show a gem among road trip movies.",1376006400,,300,5.122448979591836
