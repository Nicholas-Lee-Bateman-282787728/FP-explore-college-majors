7922098,5,B00004STA4,"This was the first piece of video or music in which I was really introduced to Rich Mullins besides hearing only a few of his songs here and there.  And its when I think I first saw him as a man set aside to deliver a different message to the world - or at least the same message that Jesus declared us to deliver, but in just such a different way than most evangelists of the last 2000 years.",1012521600,9,393,3.9746835443037973
7922099,5,B00004STA4,"This video contains four songs:  Here in America, The Color Green, Hold Me Jesus, and Creed.  I love it because of the imagery - graveyards, Irish cliffs, Kansas plains.  In Creed, Rich is playing the hammer dulcimer in the middle of an endless wheat field - quite a site.  The video contains more than four songs and a Compassion International segment, it also contains  Rich's thoughts on all types of issues that are relevant today.  He speaks from the heart about what a legacy is, about sin, and about that reckless raging fury of which he sings.  An excellent video!  Also try the ""Homeless Man"" vidoe, and the Live Video that's just come out.",972691200,19,649,4.631578947368421
