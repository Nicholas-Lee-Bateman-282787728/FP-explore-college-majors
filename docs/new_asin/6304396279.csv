It has phrases like: ""Come along into a journey right into the jaws of death!"" .... ""Observe awesome attacks on humans and see narrow escapes which will definitely make you shudder"" ... ""The series is fresh, vivid, and often astonishing.""

It sounded exciting and fun. BUT it did not warn that this is actual video of several vicious attacks on humans, in which one man is viciously killed. Halfway through this video my 7 year old was sobbing and I had knots in my stomach. I was not at all prepared for that.

Adults wanting to view these attacks and being prepared for it would find this interesting. This video tells what can be done to prevent some of these attacks and why other attacks were provoked.

I just wish it had explained what this video entailed, using more serious language, rather than fun hyperbole that all animal documentries use.

I have given it 3 stars because it is a good 58 miniutes of interesting video and narration. I would have given it more stars if the advertising on the back matched the actual video, giving warning about the content.",1188345600,,1190,4.625592417061611
