6140878,5,B00H8KRWKG,Great movie describing the hunt for learning medicinal affairs in the old times where Islam world was far more developed in comparison with Europe. The teachings of Ibn-i Sina worthed circumcision of a Christian young boy. What a story!!!,1418428800,6,238,5.128205128205129

6140882,5,B00H8KRWKG,My husband & I enjoyed this film tremendously on a flight from Vienna to the US. Is the region 1 version available anywhere?,1406419200,3,124,4.434782608695652
6140883,3,B00H8KRWKG,"Spoiler Alert:
There are two parallel stories here, both told beautifully about the most caring of physicians one can imagine, practicing the pure art of medicine(in an era before the ""business model"", the ""insurance companies"", and the ""Big Pharma""), yet trying to push the boundaries of knowledge and survive the illiterate and the chaotic forces all around them. Over 150 min long, the character development of the junior doctor, the main focus of the story, is superb. The other doctor, Avicenna, father of modern medicine, who Persians, myself included, after a thousand years, still hold as one of their greatest national stars, on par with Socrates or Jefferson in the West, is played well by the venerable Sir Kingsley who is not unfamiliar to the Persian character (see House of Sand and Fog), but his character is not developed too much despite apparently having been inferred the title of the story and the movie.

This being a German release, there is no English subtitles , and it's at times hard to understand the accented and low volume dialogue (it took me a while to hear ""side sickness"", a reference to appendicitis). The extras are all in German.

One point subtracted for historical and architectural inaccuracies surrounding the place and the events in Isfahan at the time: 1. The grand mosques and the royal buildings in the film have a Turkish or Arabeqsue design and are in no way of Persian origin (Google Naghshe Jahan Square at the city center to see what I mean). 2. The contemporary Shah to Avicenna (980 to 1037), Ala ad-Dauleh Muhammad (Persian: Abu Jafar Doshmanziyar), did not die until in an offensive campaign in 1041 (4 yrs after his most trusted physician had died). This movie unfortunately follows the same Hollywood stereotypes of Persian Kings as incompetent drunkards with too much make-up on, used in a Transphobic manner I might add (see 300 series of movies). 3. The ""Seljuqs"" attacking the city at the end were actually the Turkmen nomads. 4. The City did not fall by the death of the Shah.

Another point subtracted for not only the less time spent developing the character of Avicenna, but more seriously, the bizarre uncharacteristic portrayal of him at the very end, when with the fall of the city, he succumbs to hopelessness, and in an ultimate affront to Persians, Historians and Physicians everywhere, does the gravest unthinkable act. For the author of 450 books, including the famous ""Book of Healing"", and also a few in theology, he commits suicide! I know this is supposed to be fiction, but just like ""Abraham Lincoln the Vampire Slayer"", such bizarre departure from facts makes the story being told less credible and more hollow.",1404086400,8,2689,4.918502202643172
6140884,5,B00H8KRWKG,"An excellent adventure tale of a inquisitive young boy who, after his mother dies of side sickness and his siblings are taken away by other families, is taken in by a barber (Stellan Skarsgard).  When he becomes a young man he learns of a great school in the east taught by a famous physician (Ben Kinglsey).  He learns that this school takes only Jewish students.  He is a English Christian.  The school is in the Mideast and the Muslims, while putting up with Jews, will not allow Christians in their country.  Never the less he sets out for the school pretending to be a Jew. A superb tale with Tom Payne doing a great job as the young man with a thirst for medical knowledge.  Oliver Martinez does a fine job also as the Sultan.",1402704000,30,732,4.385185185185185
6140885,2,B00H8KRWKG,"It's so hard to like this movie when you've read the book. It's nothing like the book and almost something completely different. Just read the book. But, I might have liked this more had I not read the book. Watching the movie I felt so distant from the characters. They don't even follow the storyline. I think they should have spent more time on young Rob like in the book, so we could bond with him and get to know him more. And the Barber had so much more zest in him that didn't do him justice in the movie.  If you are a reader at all, just skip the movies and read the real story.",1512432000,,587,4.060344827586207

That's not an easy tetrad to find, but I found it here. W-O-W... I was so impressed with this film that it's my recent buzz. I've told everyone I know about it, begging them to see it. It's now my new favorite, and it's at the top of my A-list.

The quality of this film and its rendering of story is absolutely fabulous. Remarkable. The storyline has wonderful depth and it's beautifully layered. The cinematography is gorgeous and the acting is absolutely phenomenal! The casting was perfect. I don't know that I could have chosen anyone to play the parts better. Wow...

If you want an evening of true entertainment, this movie will get it done. I LOVE IT! Absolutely LOVE IT! Pay yourself a treat and watch... everything you could want in a movie is right here. And they didn't cinch one bit!",1502841600,,944,4.579881656804734

Tom Payne is a young man who loses his parents early on in the 11th century, well there are no relatives to take him so he hooks up with Stellan Skaarsgard a barber (at the time they were the doctors) He later learns he has an ability and goes to the East to learn real medicine. This tory engages you from the start and never lets go, the principals all excel at their parts nd I loved this. I don't want to say more but if you love sweeping epics and real story telling and scenery, here you go. Tom Payne Shines by the way.",1484870400,,657,4.222222222222222

6140956,1,B00H8KRWKG,"I vacillated between five stars and one star, depending on the particular scene in this awesome movie.  The main problem I had was that there are no English subtitles and at times the sound quality was too poor to make out what was being said, and then there were an equal amount of times that because of the accents, I couldn't tell what was being said.  I teach English as a Second Language to adults and listen to accents all day every day, but this was just an incredible experience in frustration to me.  I was hanging on every word and loving the premise, the acting, the scenery, the history...but then I would just have to accept that I would have to be content with only understanding about half of the actual dialogue.  I want to buy this movie in the worst way, but without subtitles it's just too exasperating.  Maybe I will need to read the book.  What is it with subtitles that causes the person in charge not to include them?

6140981,3,B00H8KRWKG,"I enjoyed the depiction of the time period, and the story. A bit too much kohl under some of the male characters eyes. I might have given it four stars if not for all the discrepancies in the depiction of the Jews. I'll elaborate on a few. At the outset in the opening, the Hebrew book on the table was upside down; the Arabic ones were not (not sure if they were Farsi). Rebecca's husband looked like a Jew straight from Brooklyn, or LA- so not Perian (no slur, I'm Jewish!).  The style of the long sidelocks was not introduced until the 18th century. The scene when Rebecca is nearly stoned for adultery could not have happened without a Sanhedrin; the Jewish High Court, which was disolved mid 4h century. It also could not have happened without two male eyewitnesses. The Hebrew term for God ""Hashem"", although it is found early in Jewish writing, was not used colloquially until modern times. The Jews crying out ""Hasem yazol"" (God help us) in the synagogue is a Modern Hebrew term, not in keeping with Perisan Jews of the 12th century. Also, the tefillin (phylacteries worn on the head) are a black box. Who came up with the flat design? With all the money Hollywood spends on a film, it seems there isn't someone consulted regarding cultural consistencies in Jewish historical life. I'm for hire.
My favorite line though was when the Moslem and Jewish students were talking about paradise and the Moslem asks what is the point of dying with no virgins awaiting and the response the Jewish student gives is ""To walk with God."" Beautiful.",1446163200,3,1543,4.631386861313868

The conviction of death by stoning of a Jewish woman who commits adultery is historically inaccurate, against Jewish Law, even in that time, and is an egregious bit of anti-Semitism, and totally unnecessary. Where is the Scottish woman who marries Rob in the book? The introduced subplot (not found in the book) of the Spanish Jewish love interest is unnecessary and a further implausible detail. The time-line is overly shortened. Much more plausible in the book, where Rob takes several years to travel from England to Isfahan (by way of France and Germany), giving him sufficient time to learn some of the languages needed in his travels. He also spends quite a few years in Isfahan, making it more believable that he could acquire the necessary skills. The movie is a travesty.",1441497600,4,858,4.965277777777778
6141002,4,B00H8KRWKG,"This is a truly wonderful film, but viewers need to be careful because virtually everything in it is not true. The premise of the film is that a young man wants to become a doctor, but cannot do so in England where he lives, because Christianity at the time felt that being a doctor was against the will of God. Not specifically stated was the idea that God is always present and if God wants a person to live, God will heal the person; for a doctor to heal is an affront against God. In contrast, at the time, the Muslim countries were in their golden age. They had doctors. But, no Christian could enter their land. The young man travels for a year to reach the famed doctor ibn Sina (also known today as a great philosopher, but not mentioned in the film) and learn medicine. To do so, he needs to disguise himself as a Jew. Surprisingly (for it never happened) he becomes a better doctor than ibn Sina. The film also has a love story, adultery, and ibn Sinas suicide (the truth is that he died of a disease).",1441152000,,1012,4.276041666666667

It has even been suggested that Christian theology contributed significantly to the revival of human dissection and autopsy by providing a new socio-religious and cultural context in which the human cadaver was no longer seen as sacrosanct. Throughout history, the dissection of human cadavers for medical education has experienced various cycles of legalization and proscription in different countries (...) An edict of the 1163 Council of Tours, and an early 14th century decree of Pope Boniface VIII have mistakenly been identified as prohibiting dissection and autopsy, but NO universal prohibition of dissection or autopsy was exercised during the Middle Ages,"" (e.g., 5-15 AD).

The settings are incredible.  the historical accuracy is very high.  The depiction of Catholics, Muslims, Jews, and others is respectful and insightful.  Religion is really the main antagonist in this movie, as it is in all centuries.  Great minds born before their time, as many say, struggle to make the world a better place through medicine.  But when cutting a corpse open leads most religions to call you a necromancer and kill you brutally, it makes the pursuit of real medicine . . . difficult.

The characters in this movie are all wonderfully portrayed.  They each represent the powers at work in this world of budding reason and terrible religious factions.  From the European ""Barber"" to the greatest ""physician"" of the time in Persia, you get a collection of men and women tossed and turned by religion, government, conscience, custom, budding knowledge, and the unenlightened man's fear.

Very entertaining.  Manages to weave a love story into an intelligent retelling of the development of medicine in the Middle East, the effects of plagues, amazing and risky discoveries, and so on.  Historical fiction at its best.

6141079,3,B00H8KRWKG,"I must say I'm a bit disappointed in this film.  It has some elements that could have made it an epic movie, but something was wrong with the execution of it, whether it be from poor writing of the screen play or poor directing, or both.  The actors seemed like they could act well enough.  I love Ben Kingsly!  The biggest problem is that it didn't draw me in.  I didn't buy into it.  I was bored a lot of the time.

Let's talk about ""drawing the viewer in"".  I can't really explain it.  I usually am drawn easily into a movie or a book losing myself in it while investing deeply in the characters.  This time I wasn't.  I kept thinking I should be as it could have been an interesting story, but something was just wrong and/or missing.  I just can't explain the reason why.

Next, the movie lacked my ""buy-in"".  Much of the movie didn't seem plausible.  It seemed inaccurate.  I felt like there was some sort of underlying agenda that was bothering me, but I just couldn't quite make it out.  Maybe it's because things weren't really fleshed out or explained.  How did an uneducated boy in the middle ages be able to suddenly read other languages, and presumably speak other languages.  They just skipped the fleshing out of the character of the main character in the story.  The story meandered without fleshing out important details.  It wanted the romance of Kingdom of Heaven, but even fell short there.  It wanted the dramatic effect of Kingdom of Heaven too, it seems, but again fell horribly short.  I think it would have been a better movie had it stuck to the story of The Physician, and stayed more accurate to the time period.

Some of the shots in the film could have been glorious.  When they show the battlefield after the battle is over,  I remember thinking how that could have invoked so much emotion if the rest of the movie had invested me at all.

Again, I think the acting was very good.  It's probably the only thing that kept me watching at all.  That and the hope of a better story sometime in the movie, which obviously never came.

The sound was irritating.  I could barely hear the actors at times, but the music and sound effects were very loud.  I'm tired of that in movies.  Please let us hear the actors.  After a while, I even stopped trying to hear what they were saying.  If I heard, fine.  If I didn't, fine also.  It's tiring trying to hear them.  I kept turning the sound up and down, up and down, but that didn't really help.

In short, as you can read, I was disappointed in this movie.  It could have been ... should have been great ... maybe even epic, but it wasn't even that good.  It was O.K.",1432512000,,2639,4.358762886597938

Also, the film suggested that the Jewish contribution, relative to the Muslim contribution (e.g. ""The Canon of Medicine"") was the more important source of what we would consider to be modern medicine. Actually, contrary to what the film shows, parts of Europe at that time had medical universities, surgery, dissections, texts, etc.

6141116,4,B00H8KRWKG,"A surprisingly fun romp, flawed in minor historical details, but good anyway. It's always a good sign when the distant past is depicted with enough authentic squalor and dirt. The story opens in the Dark Ages in 11th-century England, where the populace suffers from ignorance and disease. Itinerant barber-surgeons are all they have to turn to for medical help; Barbers risk being accused of witchcraft should anything go amiss.

A young boy, Robert Cole (Tom Payne), witnesses his mother's death from ""side-sickness,"" or appendicitis; there is no understanding of the disease. It turns out that the boy possesses an unusual gift: by putting his hand on the chest of a sufferer, he can feel whether they will live or die. Orphaned, he runs away with Barber (the great Stellan Skarsgrd), a traveling barber-surgeon. Barber apprentices Cole, teaching the crude basics of his trade, such as amputation, bloodletting, and dentistry. But Barber slowly has been going blind. A prostitute tells Barber that a certain Jewish doctor could help him. With great care, this Doctor uses skills and tools left over from the Roman Empire and Middle Eastern knowledge to help. Remarkably, this Jewish family possesses an ancient World Map, and tell Cole how to find the famous Persian healer Ibn Sina (Ben Kingsley) in the far off city of Isfahan. Cole sadly leaves Barber, traveling across an unforgiving desert, where he meets a lovely bride being brought to her wealthy, older husband. Against all odds, Cole succeeds in being accepted into Ibn Sina's school, and taught philosophy, science, and medicine that are far more advanced than European knowledge. He and Ibn Sina save the city from the Black Death, but Cole breaks taboo by secretly performing an autopsy on a Zoroastrian who died of appendicitis. He discovers enough about anatomy to perform an appendectomy on the Shah (Olivier Martinez). An entertaining adventure, overall.",1429488000,12,1923,5.163461538461538

Also amazing how illiterate boy seems to be able to read Persian and Hebrew -- I guess you assume he learned, but would be more plausible if they showed there was some effort on his part to go from completely uneducated to a great scholar as well as a doctor...I watched it for the historical medicine, which they spent little time on, so they could instead make sure to stuff romance, father-son, and war stories into it, making it diffuse and not compelling.",1429315200,10,923,4.76875

In many ways it's a story about today even though it is set in the 12th century, because it deals with Muslim radicals who are running around the territory (Persia/Turkey) beheading Christians and turning on their Jewish friends. Rob Cole, a Christian, who passes himself as a Jew in order to travel to the land of mystery to train with the best Healer of the time. He even circumcises himself to make the illusion believable. Of course there is a beautiful woman, friendships and the Black Plague to make the story even more enjoyable.

6141138,4,B00H8KRWKG,"While this film has undoubtedly garnered some mixed feelings from this particular viewer, if one is patient and is able to suspend disbelief during the more over the top elements, The Physician can be appreciated as a commendably acted, (mostly) cerebral view into an 11th century medical profession that was lamentably bereft of adequate knowledge. With absolutely stunning cinematography that brings to life the medieval Middle east, a twisting plot line and characters that invoke emotion, there is too much here to overlook it because of its glaring - and oft intentional - historical inaccuracies.

Opening in medieval London, we are introduced to Rob Cole, who is only a boy when his mother dies, but seems to have a perception or instinct that warns him someone is nearing death. Taken in by a sympathetic ""barber"" who performs medical procedures from his travelling caravan, it is this skill, along with a love of learning, that assists him throughout his apprenticeship, of sorts, to the barber. In all honesty, I nearly gave up on it entirely for the first twenty minutes or so, because it just gets so... odd during Cole's apprenticeship in London.

Apparently, medicine has not just stagnated and become a dubious practice, but there are no such things as doctors or hospitals, and no one even knows what the terms mean, which is, of course, entirely the fault of the Church in England, whom it is clearly stated equates the art of medicine with ""necromancy"". They were also the sole reason the old knowledge of Hippocrates was lost (fall of the Roman Empire, anyone?) - but when monks start throwing punches in the street, I must have gazed at my computer screen in abject stupefaction. That... was more than a little heavy handed.

Nonetheless, I persisted, and it did indeed improve vastly once Rob begins his trek to the middle eastern lands to find the noted physician, Ibn Sina (portrayed gloriously by Ben Kingsley), where medicine was far more advanced. Islamic and Judaic history also suffer to a milder degree from warpage by either the author of the book this was based on or whoever dramatized the script. It's not quite so over the top, however, and takes a backseat to the story, as not long after Cole arrives, a plague infection breaks out, and while the methods by which the doctors at Ibn Sina's medical university control and effectually cure the disease would not be hit upon until the early 20th century (though some plague experts do believe it was a contagion related to Ebola and not bubonic plague), it made for excellent fodder in watching Cole blossom into one of the best students at the university.

With a smattering of romance, intrigue and the political uphevals of the day, The Physician made for a movie I became very involved in, and would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the ancient Near East and/or the history of medical practices. I enjoyed it on both accounts, and found it to be an excellent movie if one was willing to sift through the flaws and inaccuracies.

The rest of the movie is about a young man's quest to get medical training.  He travels to the mid-east to study medicine.  He faces interesting challenges and there's interesting characters.

The sex scenes and sub-story of adultery detracted from the movie and lessened the main character.

The special effects and scenery are pretty good.

Overall, the characters and story wallow in unpleasantness.  More positive story-elements and likable-characters are needed.  The movie's depiction of the development of medical research seemed plausible and was interesting.",1428278400,9,827,5.333333333333333

There are many adventures, many close escapes, and sweepingly lush backdrops.  Yes, there appear to be some anachronisms, but on the whole it's an intelligent and worthwhile film.  I wept at the end not because of what happens to Rob Cole (spoiler alert:  our hero triumphs) but because the same issues are being played out at this very moment with devastating consequences.

Olivier Martinez is so good as a tyrant, who is really a good guy, deep down...I couldn't take my eyes off him during his scenes. Tom Payne was new to me and I am now officially a fan...he's an amazing young actor. I don't remember his name, but the boy who plays Rob Cole (Tom Payne's role) as a child is fantastic. There is a love story too, but that isn't my thing, though it is well done and sweet, it is also the typical ""forbidden love"" theme, which has grown old for me. The history of medicine in the middle east was compelling and what interested me in the first place. I highly recommend this film.

6141171,4,B00H8KRWKG,"4 1/2 STARS  FOR A TERRIFIC FILM THAT STILL MAY PUT OFF SOME FANS OF THE BOOK.-- BEST APPRECIATED AS AN INDEPENDENT WORK.

BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE INCLUDED BELOW.

The Physician (Der Medicus) is a German film, in English here, based on a novel by Noah Gordon.  It is a fictional work that borrows from a rich history and fame surrounding the physician, philosopher, and scientist Ibn Sina, though he is not the main protagonist.  Instead, the focus is on a young man who travels to Isfahan, Persia (modern day Iran), to study with this preeminent thinker at a university patroned by the Shaw himself, as well as other wealthy residents.  It is not a perfect film, but the settings are beautiful and the story inspiring.  There are substantial changes from the book and plenty of negative commentary around the net regarding the adaptation.  I went in viewing it as a work independent from the book and really enjoyed it.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  The story begins in 1021 England with the death of Robert Cole's mother while he is still just a boy.  He is now orphaned, but obsessed by his inability to save his mother and fascinated by medicine in general.  He latches on to an itinerant barber (also a physician of sorts back then) who travels around practicing medieval European medicine, selling fake potions, pulling teeth and setting broken bones.  We move quickly forward to Robert (Tom Payne) as a young man.  During their limited travels, they encounter a community of Jews with a healer possessing greater skill than they have seen before.  Robert presses them for the source of their knowledge and learns that he must travel to Isfahan in Persia to study under the great Ibn Sina (Ben Kingsley).  Unfortunately he is also told he cannot because he is Christian and would be killed.  Undeterred, Robert embarks on his journey while posing as a Jew for at least some hope of safety.  He will encounter a journey of adventure, learning, service, love, and enlightenment he never could have imagined.

ADAPTATION:  I don't want to get into a bunch of details, but there are significant changes that could cause fans of the novel problems.  Some characters are omitted while other relationships are altered, such as Rebecca (Emma Rigby) who travels with his caravan on her way to be married.  I really liked Rachel's character independent from the book so I accepted it.  I also felt it was a terrific role of substance for the beautiful Emma Rigby.  If you are a fervent fan of the book, you may wish to check commentary around the net about the adaptation unless you accept up front it will be different.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  This story is set in what is now called the Golden Age of Islam.  Despite some images projected today, many will be surprised to know that substantial tolerance was observed in that region (for some time) that did not exist in many other parts of the known world.  Ancient science and medicine lost to the Dark Ages of Europe survived and flourished in Persia.  Even religious and philosophical scholarship was nurtured.  The protagonist Robert Cole is completely fictional, but Ibin Sina (Latinized Avicenna) is considered perhaps the greatest Islamic thinker, and one of the greatest thinkers of all human cultures throughout history.  His history is also altered substantially to fit this story, not to mention some medical advances.  However, the spirit and homage to his memory is worth while.  Doing a little research was interesting for me since I have been to Afghanistan and was surprised to learn Ibn Sina's family actually hailed from Balk, now part of Afghanistan, and he was born in Bukhara, now part of Uzbekistan.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  I really enjoyed this movie and it even maintains a feel of a small epic.  The CGI architecture isn't always perfectly realistic, but it is beautiful.  Isfahan is stunning.  The plot connections are also rushed in a few areas in an attempt to fit the story into a movie's run time.  That is not uncommon for book adaptations, though I would like to have seen a little more.  I am mentioning a little critique only to inform and be fair.  I am a definite fan of this movie.  I recommend a rental first, and book fans should prepare themselves.  That done, I hope you find an upside surprise.",1426550400,68,4281,4.79890560875513

It acted in a similar way to how a DVD player would treat a Blu-Ray disc, it recognized there was a disc in it, but couldn't read it.  I had tried to update the player, but that didn't help.

Sadly, I didn't try it right away and I had just missed the 30 day return policy, which had been some months ago, so I would have returned it if it had been possible.  I understood that the movie was getting an American release direct to video, but I'm disappointed that it looks like it will be only in the DVD format.
