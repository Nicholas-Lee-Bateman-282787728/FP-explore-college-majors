8383133,4,B002WIXHYE,"VCI's third volume in its 'British Cinema Collection' includes four films by second-tier UK studio Renown Pictures ('The Pickwick Papers,' 1951's 'A Christmas Carol')-- three crime-dramas and one straight drama, all from the 1950s, on two single-sided discs.  The best are the touching 'The Scamp' (3 1/2 stars), featuring the always engaging Richard Attenborough as a childless schoolteacher who by special arrangement takes in a troubled boy whose main problem is his brutish father; and 'Grand National Night' (3 1/2 stars), an entertaining murder-mystery in which we know whodunit (upright citizen Nigel Patrick, amidst mitigating circumstances) from the start and spend the rest of the movie rooting for him to outwit Scotland Yard.  The others, which were my initial reason for purchasing the set, can be categorized as somewhat tepid noirs: the obtusely titled 'The Rough and the Smooth' (3 stars), an overwrought black-widow yarn starring a Richard Burton-esque Tony Britton and directed by the legendary Robert Siodmak; and Terence Fisher's 'Kill Me Tomorrow' (2 1/2 stars), with a long-in-the-tooth Pat O'Brien playing a washed-up newspaperman caught between his sick son, the bottle and ruthless gangsters in a plot so ludicrously convoluted you wonder how in the world it gets resolved in just 74 minutes.  Black-and-white prints are reasonably sharp and blemish-free with clear audio.  Content settles somewhere around 3-plus stars (no extras worth mentioning), with the nicely priced presentation boosting the package closer to 4.",1373673600,3,1544,5.529661016949152
8383134,5,B002WIXHYE,"It is good to see again the old British movie dramas which only now
are being released on DVD. This collection includes four movies
namely ""The Rough and the Smooth"" (1959), ""The Scamp"" (1957), ""Kill
Me Tomorrow"" (1957) and ""Grand National Night"" (1953).

The movie that I have selected for this review is ""The Scamp"", a
favourite of mine and the reason that I chose this particular disc
for purchase.

Made in 1957 and starring Richard Attenborough, Terence Morgan,
Jill Adams and Colin Petersen who is fresh from his winning role
in the Australian movie ""Smiley"".

It is the story of a schoolmaster (Richard Attenborough) who
befriends a street urchin named Tod (Colin Petersen). Tod is the
product of a broken marriage and is being neglected by his drunken
father. The boy is bad tempered and revengeful taking out his
frustration on society. The schoolmaster does his best to guide
the boy to a better life despite the odds against him.

Colin Petersen who was a charmer in the movie ""Smiley"" shows here
that he has considerable talent as a dramatic actor. The movie is
a good drama with a surprising twist at the end.

The other movies on the disc are reasonably good entertainment.
The disc has been digitally remastered and is in pristine condition.

I have given this disc a five star rating because of the movie
""The Scamp"". The other movies although good would not rate so
highly.",1275868800,3,1390,4.746887966804979

THE ROUGH AND THE SMOOTH (1959) (102 min/B&W) -- Robert Siodmak (Director) - Nadja Tiller, Tony Britton & William Bendix
The story line and plot is a little hard to swallow.  As the film draws to an end it keeps you still puzzled, what was this all about.

THE SCAMP (1957) (86 min/B&W) -- Wolf Rilla -- (Director/Screenwriter) - Richard Attenborough, Dorothy Alison, Colin Petersen, Terence Morgan & Jill Adams
Outstanding performances by the entire cast with heartfelt direction by Wolf Rilla --- Featuring a young Richard Attenborough too boot.

KILL ME TOMORROW (1957) (74 min/B&W) -- Terence Fisher (Director) - Pat O'Brien, Lois Maxwell, George Coulouris, Wensley Pithey & Tommy Steele
Great direction by Terence Fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading British horror film directors at the Hammer studio.  Pat O'Brien and Lois Maxwell are mismatched and their scenes together are evident of that.

GRAND NATIONAL NIGHT (1953) (80 min/B&W) -- Bob McNaught (Director) - Nigel Patrick, Moira Lister, Beatrice Campbell & Betty Ann Davies
With a couple of slick twists this develops into a thriller, with an unsuspecting ending that gives the customer their monies worth.
