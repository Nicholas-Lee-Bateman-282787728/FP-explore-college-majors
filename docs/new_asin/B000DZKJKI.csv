My Son loves the dvd, I don't get a headache, I do get a relaxing time with my son.  what a great video for kids. Max and Ruby are so relaxing and fun, with no toxic vapors/gas.",1204502400,,274,4.055555555555555
8103071,1,B000DZKJKI,"This product releases insidious toxic vapor or gas - even when not in the player. The vapor/gas is odorless, but gives me a terrible headaches after a few minutes, that last for hours, and our child acts very strange when it is played, and for several hours afterwards.

It seems our child may be addicted to the disorienting effects of the vapor/gas, because she is very demanding about wanting to play it, but when we play it, she doesn't even watch the video.  The music accompanied by the toxic vapor seem to captivate her.

It took us a while to figure this out because whatever this toxic vapor/gas is, it is odorless, but the cause-effect on us is remarkably consistent.  We have occassionally had a problem like this with DVDs (one being another Ruby and Max DVD) but we could smell always smell the toxic vapor/gas.  On this one there is no smell.  It is odorless, which made it a real brain-teaser for us.  We are going to sell it at a second-hand store.",1204243200,,964,4.505747126436781
