8492244,5,B0063T16X2,"I caught this show back in 2009-2010 on IFC and about cracked a rib watching it.  I had to get this collection and switched my computer to play region 2 dvd's but its well worth it.  By far one of the funniest tv shows around.  A mix of seinfeld, arrested development, and classic british tv humor.  Very modern, and has a very funny plot line.  This show covers everything from drugs, murder, incest, necrophilia, as well as your normal topics like, gangs, family relationships, and lovers!  If you like a great comedy, with some really dark twists then get this DVD collection!",1391904000,2,579,4.627450980392157
8492245,5,B0063T16X2,I ordered the dvds and received them in less than a week when I stated it could be a 4 or more weeks. Thanks for the speed of delivery. I love this series even if I can only watch them on my computer. Stupid region codes. Again thanks.,1377561600,3,235,3.9166666666666665
8492246,5,B0063T16X2,"A show that will never air on mainstream TV (except on BBC), because of it's subject matter and lack of advertising potential.
No laugh track. Real dialogues that do not consist of an endless exchange of lame wisecracks. No excessive violence or sex. No computer graphics or spectacular car chases. No wholesome moral message.
Moss (played by Johnny Vegas) is a small time London weed dealer with a diverse clientele and a special relationship with the neighborhood constable. His daily interactions with customers, girl friends, and authorities make for a hilariously funny story, that has so much more realism, intelligence, depth, and humor than ""Weeds"".",1365206400,4,657,5.266666666666667
