2625898,2,B000H309DS,"I've had enough of these damn so called ""experts"" on AC/DC saying the same BS over and over and over again. About the only thing I hadn't heard before was a part on how there was a war going on at the time they recorded this where they where staying, but where too busy to even notice. And it's just annoying that they are supposed to be talking about this great album but cant help but throw in a few lines of, ""Brian us s*** compared to Bon"" and how would Bon have done the album and Bon this, Bon that. The fact is, you can say what you want but the album is Brian, so live with it ""experts""

Then there is a few members of Dirty DC playing the songs... big deal... I  want to see AC/DC do it, not a cover band and there guess' and opinions.

About the only person interviewed  on this who knows what he is talking about is the production guy on the album, or whoever he was. He was actually there and has facts to say, not just opinions, guess' and ideas of what MIGHT have been.

Don't waste your time on this, these experts are idiots and don't tell you anything new. It's just so dumb that they release themselves on one DVD saying how bad Brian is and wishing Bon was still around, then they come out on this saying it's the greatest album of all time.

I've had enough of these things. If it doesn't have AC/DC members talking about it (and that does not include past members) then don't bother with it. And this one does not have a single member of AC/DC to be heard. Just half a live song. They couldn't even let you watch the whole thing.

What makes these people ""experts""? They wrote a book on them? Asked someone who knows AC/DC? Have any of them actually met any of them and gotten a straight answer out of AC/DC? Usually AC/DC respond with jokes... for example, it's mentioned in this that Brian was asked what ""Giving The Dog A Bone"" was about and he replied, ""it's about cats and dogs"" because he loves animals... and the guy says he doesn't think so. Well, DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Brian was joking when he said that, did Brian have to make that clearer? What the heck do you think the songs about? It doesn't take a genius to work out the obvious. Brian was taking the p*** out the person who asked that question cause it's too obvious what it's about and Brian gave a better answer by joking then just saying, ""it's about sex dummy""

experts, uh huh, sure. Hope they don't get paid for doing these things.",1174435200,10,2425,4.256521739130434
2625899,1,B000H309DS,"This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it.",1169942400,15,668,4.106870229007634

8136109,5,B000H309DS,"Man, some of the reviewers here are idiots.  Did they even watch the piece?  Yeah it is a bunch of non-band members talking about the album, but the people are knowledgable, as well as for the one idiot who said what makes these people experts... Lets see, one of them was Tony Platt... the ENGINEER ON THE ALBUM, so I think the guy who put down all of the tracks and was in the studio knows a little something about the album.  Tons of stories, archive footage, and if anything the information I have later researched is dead on",1223769600,3,529,4.3232323232323235
8136110,1,B000H309DS,"So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".

This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless.",1189382400,,443,4.211764705882353
