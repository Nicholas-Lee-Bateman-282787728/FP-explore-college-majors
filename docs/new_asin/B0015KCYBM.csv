3145399,5,B0015KCYBM,"I saw this film several years ago in a couple of different settings/uses and decided to look it up again to use in a Wednesday night worship service.

The one many saw on youtube or at church comes with a salvation message &/or scripture subtitled on the film. This film does not - this film is the original which just tells the story . . . with that said; the film is still great, but it might not be the one you wish to use in a church setting.",1264291200,20,381,3.8354430379746836

3145402,5,B0015KCYBM,"This movie was very moving.  How a father's horrible experience, he can still move on.  When all is lost, he picks up and moves on.  I'd recommend this to anybody!",1243123200,,163,4.366666666666666
3145403,5,B0015KCYBM,"You see father's heart through out the movie. The son  not only know the father but also love the father. The son did what the father will do...  The weather might be cold, but you will be warm by the love between sisters, lovers, mother and son, all the people in the train and at the train station; screen by screen the story is touching your own heart.",1235433600,7,355,4.205882352941177
3145404,5,B0015KCYBM,What an awesome film.  It was short but well done.  An amazing message to the world in symbolism.  I will appreciate all the more what God has done for us through this film.,1235174400,10,173,4.181818181818182

3145407,5,B0015KCYBM,"A portion of this movie was sent to me years ago in an email.  I was moved by it and wanted to get the movie.  Unfortunately it said the name was ""The Bridge"" so I couldn't find.  However, the word ""Most"" in this respect...means ""Bridge""  so I finally found it here on Amazon.

This movie is amazing.  It keeps you holding your breath and tears.  The ""making of most"" was extremely impressive as it discusses the hard times they had making the movie as well as the times they feel God helped them along the way.

God certainly was with this crew when this was made.  It will make you look into your heart and shows you that your choices matter and you may not understand at the time, but you do someday find out.  This is wonderful.",1403481600,2,732,4.239130434782608

3145412,5,B0015KCYBM,"One of my all-time favorite films, along with To Kill A Mockingbird and The Least of These.

I order 3 or 4 copies at a time, because everyone who sees it asks me where they can get a copy. I just ordered more because some summer interns who work for me started asking about faith when I bowed my head to say grace in a restaurant lunch meeting.

Winner of many awards, this is one of the most powerful short films ever made. It is one of the few films that I know of that will leave a life-long lasting impression on everyone who views it.

It is a story of a father's love for his son and the people in the world; the son's love for his father and those same people; the unawareness of those people of that love and how it would save them; the sacrifice paid to save them, whether they ever appreciated that sacrifice or not; and the salvation and rebirth that resulted.

Please see this film. If you don't like it, message me and I will cheerfully buy it at your full purchase price and give it to someone else.",1372464000,6,1014,4.158163265306122
3145413,5,B0015KCYBM,"I teach Religious Education at the Junior High School level (6-8 graders) and this movie is always one of the high points of all my lesson plans.  Even the most apathetic students are drawn in to the discussions we have after this movie.  Outstanding movie on so many levels that proves that a film does not have to be 2+ hours, have mega-superstar actors, and cutting edge special effects to impact a wide and varied audience in a very powerful way.",1370995200,3,450,4.54320987654321
3145414,5,B0015KCYBM,This is an excellent film to share with family and friends.  It can also be used in Church for youth groups to demonstrate what God did for us when His Son died for us on the Cross.,1367452800,,181,3.891891891891892
3145415,5,B0015KCYBM,"this is an incredible portrayal of the Father's Love. The description -- John 3:16 in 33 minutes -- says it best. I recommend this to all but I think a certain maturity level is needed to fully understand it. My daughter watched it when she was 14 at youth group, and now again at 17. She was able to appreciate it much more this time. I LOVE this movie.",1367280000,,354,4.144927536231884

While we were still sinners, Christ saved us anyway.",1363737600,,106,4.35
3145417,5,B0015KCYBM,"This is a deeply moving modern-day parable that reflects the sacrifice of God's Son for our salvation. It would be a great discussion-starter for a non-religious group, to open up the discussion about the gospel. A variety of people can seem themselves as one of the persons who was saved, never knowing the cost paid for their salvation, except one who changed, and the joy it brought to the father.
A short film with a powerful impact.
The film is in Czech, with English subtitles. But this is not a major problem, as most of the story requires no dialogue at all.",1362441600,4,566,4.5588235294117645
3145418,5,B0015KCYBM,Worth it! Even better if you have someone to share you thoughts after watching movie. I think it would be a good movie for high-school teachers.,1360195200,,144,4.576923076923077
3145419,5,B0015KCYBM,I saw a clip of this movie at my church at the midweek before Easter. This movie is based on a true story and at the same time shows a more human like reference to how much God loves us and sacrifices his only son.,1356739200,,214,3.7777777777777777
3145420,5,B0015KCYBM,"I Found this movie amazing. The message speaks to us about a Fathers Love it will reach many young men and women growing up without a true father experience.

3145421,4,B0015KCYBM,"Althoug written by an American writer this Czech motion picture steps into the unique Slovak narration tradition. Several narratives run in parallel to artfully and empathetically link together. This is in positive contrast to the intrusive mission style of certain Christians who have destroyed the art of that motion picture by cutting it and underlaying it with an bold printed message (as seen on YouTube). The motion picture itself leaves the message of the story to be interpreted by the viewer which is a much more empathetical way to communicate a message. It narrates a story which is with no doubt ment as a parable but it never tries to force the viewer in a Christian interpretation of the parable.
I deeply regret that so many reviewers of that film do reference and honour the Christian message with their evaluation. The Salvation message is truly an honourable and wonderful message. But as reviewer we should evaluate the film and not its Christian interpretation (which is never given by the film itself). Evaluating the film I can only conclude that the way the strory is told is unique and great. Especially the emotional content is never excessive or manipulative. The sacrifiece of the father becomes valuable to the viewer because nearly three quater of the story is about the wonderful realtionship and the close emotional bonds between the father and his little son. The spiritual lostness of the train passengers is expressed by pictures and fragments of several discrete stories, reflecting their physical lostness if the train would crash into the bridge instead of crossing it. The love of the son for those passengers is expressed by very short captures of the boy's face smiling at them.
The whole narration is kind of a cutback as it starts with the father searching for a sense of his sacrifiece. The narration ends with him finding the sense in ""new life"" represented by a little baby he finds on the arms of a loving mother who is one of the rescued lost passangers. Without knowing this framework the narration of the film is difficult to understand. Some of the narration lines become fictive scenes when the viewer knows the end. But viewing it the first time those scenes (e. g. the father walking along the train with all the passengers carrying his son on his arms at the railway station) are confusing because they do not logically fit in the timeline of the main story (they cant be at the station during departure time and then be at the bridge sooner as the train by walking there). Only when the viewer is watching that film the second (or may be the third) time certain scenes can be resolved as surreal and as keys to the hidden message. I fear that such artful narration style may interlectually overstrain a non academic audience. Therefore I would reduce my score from five to four stars.",1348185600,,2839,4.807770961145194
3145422,5,B0015KCYBM,"I saw a short youtube version of the film and was amazed by how powerfully it moved me. So I decided to purchase the DVD and show it to my worship/praise group of about 30 people. The full length story is even more touching and I don't think there was a dry eye in the room afterward. It definitely touched many hearts and stirred strong feelings and reflection.

Just a word of caution, this version does not include Bible passages or explanations on the bottom of the screen. So be prepared to read the study guide for the film (which is included on the DVD) so you know how to explain the film's meaning and significance. Some people missed how the father's joy at seeing the drug-addict with a child at the end of the film was a reflection of how happy God ultimately was in making the sacrifice. So I would recommend giving a quick run-down of the film and the symbolism, or even better, just print out the study guide for everyone.

There were many question from the audience afterward, so be prepared to answer them.

Anyways, ""Most"" is an outstanding film and I highly recommend it for any Christian small group setting (or even large group if you can pull it off). It's also a good film to show people new in the faith and those who are questioning.",1310428800,6,1258,4.413793103448276
3145423,5,B0015KCYBM,"After watching this movie, I'd have to say I don't know if I could do what this man did - sacrifice his son to save strangers who really don't care. In most cases they don't care about anyone else but themselves. I think I'd have to save my son, quit my job and move. If I did sacrifice my son, I'd be dead emotionally. This is a powerful movie that makes you think. You can look at it in a religious way or not. This is a perfect example of what God did for us when he sacrificed his son for us.",1309392000,2,496,3.872549019607843
3145424,5,B0015KCYBM,"This is really a great DVD on a ""father's love"" and because of that love what he was willing to do for others!  Which reminds me of another ""Father's love"" that He also was willing to give His Son's life as well and for the entire lost world; that, as many as would receive His Son's sacrifice, in their stead, that He would receive their penalty for their sins, then they would be acquitted from their sins, ""IF"" they would accept His Son's sacrifice, for each of them, that they then would be forgiven, but at the price of His Son's life.

Which reminds me of another ""Father's love"" that He also was willing to give His Son's life as well and for the entire lost world; that, as many as would receive His Son's sacrifice, in their stead, that He would receive their penalty for their sins, then they would be acquitted from their sins, ""IF"" they would accept His Son's sacrifice, for each of them, that they then would be forgiven, but at the price of His Son's life. John 3:16",1307232000,2,550,4.288461538461538
