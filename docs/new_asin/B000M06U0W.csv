8165441,5,B000M06U0W,"This was one of Amy's first DVDs, yet it's one of my favorites.  You do about 20 minutes of hi lo aerobics, followed by 20 minutes of body pump, then a cool down for a total of 47 minutes.

What I enjoyed about this DVD:

**Amy looks like she is having a blast, so I can't help but enjoy myself too.
**the 20 minute hi lo section is perfect for a quick energy lift.
**the hi lo moves are pretty easy to pick up so you can just focus on working hard.
**the clean set background.  The set looks like it is someone's living room.  I like it because it is not distracting.
**the music, as usual Amy is a master at picking music that perfectly fits the workout.
**the body pump section is just enough to feel that you've worked your entire body.

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting a fun and efficient cardio and toning workout.",1283731200,,835,4.1875
8165442,5,B000M06U0W,"In about 47 minutes you get a complete cardio and toning workout including abs. The first half is hi/lo and gets your heart rate up pretty good. Easy to follow fun aerobics. It ends at the right time before it gets boring and goes into the toning portion. She uses tubing, weights, stability ball and the step. It's not overly hard, but it's no easy workout either. It packs a good punch for the length and maximizes the time efficiently leaving you feel good, energetic and worked out.",1210032000,3,486,4.534090909090909
