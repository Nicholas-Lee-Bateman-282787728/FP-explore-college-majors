Pedro is the new superintendent replacement for a banana plantation company on a remote tropical port. Sabotage is in the air as Tito and his gang want total control of the island's products and don't like the foreign company's domination. In the process, Pedro meets the rumbera, whom is the port's star cabaret singer and dancer. Eventually, Pedro finds out that his friend Tito is behind the sabotage incidents and, a romance flares between Pedro and Mara.

I have the 2007 MediaLink studio release. The picture on the cover about the boy who gets trampled is deleted from this DVD version. I don't know if the 2004 Camara studio release has this particular scene or not. The movie itself was originally released in 1943 with the boy being trampled. It is very upsetting to see the icon picture on the cover and not being able to see that emotional scene. I gave the DVD a 3-star because it's edited. Otherwise, I would have given it a higher rating.",1313366400,,1227,4.623853211009174
