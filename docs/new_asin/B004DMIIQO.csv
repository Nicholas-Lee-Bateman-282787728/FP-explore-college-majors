8425641,1,B004DMIIQO,"First declaration...I love, love Chad Allen, why did he do this mess?  I still love you Chad. You are forgiven. The order of the day? Large bosoms! They flaunt them whenever. The budget was maybe 10 bucks. I tried to look at this as satire, still so bad. One of the requirements of the actors must have been ""please be talentless"" Bad script, bad screenplay, bad writing, bad direction, bad editing. did I mention bad acting? really dumb ending. The absolute worst actor is Richard Curtin who plays and plays badly the director. The only decent actor is Adam Kitchen who plays Gil (how did he get in this mess?) he was good. Really predictable really lame. Spare yourself. I can't believe I watched the entire thing maybe that is good for one star. That I actually made it. I deserve a date with Chad Allen for that alone!",1435190400,,822,4.516778523489933
8425642,4,B004DMIIQO,"Unimaginatively plotted but comes to life once the characters start getting killed and there are plenty of victims.  The only cast member I recognized: Chad Allen is underused, but at least his appearance was not simply a cameo.",1429920000,,228,5.0

8425644,4,B004DMIIQO,"If you are a fan of horror B-Movies, then you will love Fright Flick. The plot is simple; the cast of a B-Movie are mysteriously murdered. Whodunit? Was it the slimy director (Richard D. Curtain)? The angry producer (Todd Jenkins)? The jealous supporting actress (Daphne Khoury)?

This film is billed as a horror-comedy, so as expected most lines of dialogue serves to deliver jokes or to further the plot. It's somewhat stilted and choppy, but purposefully so. Still, there are some very funny moments like make-up artist Chase's (Charles Baker) monologue and starlet Ophelia's (Valerie Nelson) flubbed lines (""anusly and vaginally""). The characters are little more than props to be murdered in some beautifully brutal fashion. Let's be honest, this is why we love these sorts of films. Oh, and note to self : never lean over a gas station counter.

In horror films, the audience should root for the survival of the ""last woman standing."" One of the ""twists"" of this film is that her identity is hidden until later in the film. I found her identity to be surprising, but once her identity was uncovered I got behind her (no pun intended) 100 %. The identity of the killer may not be as surprising to those familiar with horror films, but the final fright was still very fun.",1304121600,3,1275,4.790909090909091
8425645,4,B004DMIIQO,"Fright Flick is the second feature film directed by Israel Luna that I've had the pleasure of seeing, following last years Ticked Off Trannies With Knives. After watching both of Luna's indie horror flicks, it's obvious that Luna wants to bring camp back into horror. And I applaud that, as I'd much rather watch a horror movie with a sense of humor and fun than something like Paranormal Activity or Saw V. Fright Flick isn't exactly the most original horror movie out there. The plot of a film making cast & crew making a horror movie, and then suffering the same bloody fate as in their movie has been done many times, most famously in Scream 3. Still, there is some fun dialogue and plenty of gory kills in Fright Flick. And I can't remember any of the deaths being off-screen. And I read on some website where they said Fright Flick had no nudity. Well, I guess whoever said that was slept through some of this movie, because there are three nude scenes. Bottom line: Fright Flick isn't one of the best slasher movies ever made, and it's not even the best slasher movie made in the last year. But it's still a must-see for the slasher fan who has seen everything and wants something fresh and new.",1297987200,4,1202,4.493150684931507
