8159645,3,6301813715,"A group of typical 80s teens (sure, let the only one drinking and smoking the funny stuff be the driver!) venture out for a week of camping at Rainbow Valley Park. Who cares that Rainbow Valley used to be known as ""Little Norway"" due to its settlement by immigrants from said country? And who doesn't know that Vikings were most prominent in that part of Scandinavia back in the day? Big deal, so the Vikings had a group of savages called Berserkers, known for partaking in cannibalism of the enemy during battle while wearing and using the skins, snouts and claws of bears? And that direct descendents of the Berserkers could become possessed and thus take on their brutal characteristics.... you do see where this is going, don't you? Our frolicking campers don't, at least, not at first. While this harder to find ""slasher"" flick (as of this writing, it's still only floating around in old VHS tapes distributed by Starmaker, with nary a DVD release in sight) slows down to a (bear?) crawl for most of the second half, you are treated somewhat to a more original take on the saturated, ""by the numbers"" camping horror subgenre. There's even a bit of star value in the mix with George ""Buck"" Flower, working a bad Norwegian accent to boot. One thing's for sure: the fog machine rental must have accounted for half the budget. An interesting and likeable film that, possibly, will lose some of its charm when/if more widely distributed. 5/10",1287360000,6,1442,4.726190476190476
