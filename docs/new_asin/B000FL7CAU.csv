2571118,5,B000FL7CAU,"This is the best season in some ways....

""The best, Larry...only the best for Song""",1150934400,4,84,4.6
2571119,5,B000FL7CAU,"This season was fantastic. I didn't know what to expect after Season 4, since I wasn't very impressed with it, but this season goes back to its roots. Just as funny as the early seasons, which is rare on any show.

I hope this season isn't the last, since Larry David proved it is still hilarious. However; if it is the last season, it's the best last season of any show I've ever seen. What a way to go out.

If you want a solid box of laughs, this season is pure quality.",1149120000,17,473,4.075268817204301
2571120,5,B000FL7CAU,"First off I love that guy's witty ""prettyyyyyyyyyyy good"" review!

I do not have HBO, so I went out on a limb after reading reviews of CURB and bought the DVDS.

Simply stated CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM has now become my all-time favorite sitcom.

Classic Larry David wit and candor in the vain of SEINFELD, only funnier and more risque. ""The Group?"" ""Pant's Tent?"" ""The Doll?""

I can hear you all laughing at the mere mention of these episode titles...

Season 4 was a disappointment after such run away classics from the previous seasons, but I have heard Season 5 finds Larry back on track.

Having not seen Season 5, I am counting down the days...

I have to thank Mr. David for allowing people like myself the freedom to speak candidly, be the occasional putz and offer constructive criticism now and then without being termed a ""victim of circumstance.""

I hope Season 5 is truly not ""The End.""

One more season, Lare. To not do so would simply be just ""one big bowl of wrong.""",1148428800,10,977,4.537142857142857
2571121,5,B000FL7CAU,"I'm a big fan of CYE and a lot of people have asked me what I think of season 5, so here's my review:

Pretty good. Prettyyyyyy, pretttyyyyyyy, pretttttyyyyyyyyyyyy, prettyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, pretyyyyyy good. It's pretty good.

Hope you find this helpful.",1148342400,232,258,5.425
2571122,5,B000FL7CAU,"Hot Dang! This season is hilarious, never once disappoints. I have the subsequent four season as well, and although this doesn't rank as the funniest (Season 2 is off the chains!) still the 5th season is great. Larry David is the man, and as long as I live he will never seize his greatness. Superb season, I highly recommend checking it out if your not an consistent watcher.",1147824000,8,376,4.544117647058823
2571123,5,B000FL7CAU,"Curb Your Enthusiasm the complete 5th season is one the funniest of them all. They all are funny, however there are some very funny episodes in this season. The Bowtie, The Christ Nail, Kamakazi Bingo, The Sedar, The Ski Lift The Korean Bookie and The End. The weakest one which I thought would be 100 perect better than it was the Smoking Jacket. When Larry goes to the playboy Hugh Hefner Mantion. Could have been funnier. That episode was probably one of the worst of the whole series. They have an untitled featuree on this DVD i wonder what it is. Curb is still the funniest show out there. Never get sick of it!!!

Cranky, ill-mannered, and sorely lacking a filter - Larry David brings it. No one does screaming matches like CYE does. It's basically  Seinfeld on steroids with a lotta F-bombs thrown in because it's HBO-and it can. Leon, Suzy, and the obnoxious blind guy are a just a few of my favorite characters.

2571582,5,B000FL7CAU,"Larry David has (again) created one of the funniest shows, EVER! His character is at the same time, sympathetic, obnoxious, compelling, off-putting...well, you get the idea. A simple creature with a personality as direct as Bart Simpson, but one who we can always expect to say and do the wrong thing at the absolute wrong time, with the wrong people and even when we can see it coming, the moment is as fresh and surprising as all get out. And we laugh and laugh...

It's an instant classic and will probably grow in legend now that the series has wrapped - much as (his) Seinfeld did. The regulars on the show, I hesitate to call them the ""supporting,"" cast as they are all starring in their own right, are fantastic. Supporting is an appropriate concept in Improvisation, which is how the show is ""written."" I haven't had the privilege of being part of or observing David's process, but have done Improv all my life and the results work as well as any scripted show. The show's editing must be of the same mind as David, the impresario, and give's us a show the entertains, informs and stimulates...but most of all, it makes you laugh.

Larry David fits right in with Giants of Television like,  David Milch, Steven Bochco, Norman Lear, Milton Berle.

But enough flowery words. CURB can be as blue collar, well, at least as middle-class as you are, just don't take the show, or yourself, too seriously. If you haven't seen Curb yet, I highly recommend going back to Season 1 and binge watch through each season, in order,  but only if you can go long periods without eating, because you will laugh so hard and for so long, that you are sure to get a stomach ache and probable eject any food in your mouth.  David has been presenting himself lately as a Rich Prick, up in class from a Poor Schmuck and with a whole new set of friends. Gee, wish I was one of them.",1466812800,,1865,4.470588235294118

2573210,5,B000FL7CAU,"I think that Season 5 of Curb is where the show did two things: it hit its comedic stride and it started to fall apart. Larry David, king of the self-indulgent comics can be the funniest thing on wheels when he's at the top of his game, but he can also drag you down into a pit of inside jokes that are so inside only he understands them. Don't get me wrong, I love this show, I have watched every episode several times, but at times he gets so hung up on minor plot things (and blows them up into giant plot things without substance) that I find myself reaching for the fast-forward button. Too many hospital scenes, for one, and just a bit too much dark humor at times. Still a great series, David is a genius of the highest order and this series kind of lets you look inside his mind and life to a pretty intense degree.

David turns things I never would have thought of into hilarious story lines. The camerawork is a bit unusual this season, just FYI. I can't get enough of Larry's irritation with people. He says all the things I want to say. And probably should say. There is such a thing as ""too nice."" Larry doesn't have that problem--LOL. Although I'm usually in his corner! P.S.

I also love ""The End"" which is an hour long episode with some great guest stars, with Dustin Hoffman as Larry's heaven guide and Bea Arthur as his mother.

2574059,5,B000FL7CAU,Larry David is a genius and hilarious with his dark humor.  I highly recommend the series for a great laugh.,1378166400,,108,4.4
2574060,5,B000FL7CAU,"Season five of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is notable for being a somewhat experimental season of the show. It features significantly more religion-based humor and plots than any other season coming before it. Larry David doesn't just not back away from religion; he doesn't pull any punches. There are episodes that have storylines about Christianity, Judaism, a sex offender, and the afterlife.

""The Larry David Sandwich"" is an excellent premiere, and introduces the subject of religion when the titular character believes that he was saved from drowning by God. ""The Bowtie"" is a pretty solid (although somewhat weak by 'Curb' standards) episode, and the sole episode that Wanda Sykes stars in. Next up is ""The Christ Nail,"" a fan favorite with so many funny sub-plots in it (the tooth fairy, the bra) it's impressive that they were able to cram them all in one episode. ""Kamikaze Bingo"" involves a Japanese art dealer who nearly commits suicide after being told by Larry that his father was not a real Kamikaze pilot. The fifth episode, ""Lewis Needs a Kidney,"" is an underrated classic with one of the funnier physical gags of the show: Larry being denied food by the employee of a fast food restaurant because he walked through a drive-thru instead of driving.

""The Smoking Jacket"" is considered by many to be one of the weakest episodes of the show, and I would agree until I saw Larry and Jeff throw out the used mattress after the credits. On a side note, I'm pretty sure it's the only 'Curb' episode I've ever seen that had a closing tag after the credits. ""The Seder"" revolves around Larry inviting a sex offender to Seder, which results in dark comedy. I felt nervous about having laughed at Susie protecting Sammy from the sex offender when he tries to shake her hand. It's what any mother should do, but in the way it's played out here, it's also cringe humor that couldn't get much cringe-ier. ""The Ski Lift"" is another brilliant episode involving Judaism. The penultimate (""The Korean Bookie""), although not a classic episode, is a good example of an episode that does something that most classic 'Curb' episodes do: intertwine numerous plots cleverly. The season finale (""The End"") is one of the most polarizing episodes of the show to date, and several fans of the show view it as a disappointment. I don't know if it's quite that bad. There were maybe some moments that were a little overdone (all the special effects and stuff) although it also had some great cinematography and was quite funny.

Overall, season five of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' is a slight improvement over season four. While certainly not as cohesive, it has a better start. It also had a more experimental (even if also occasionally a little surrealist) nature this season. However, more Wanda Sykes would have been nice, and I also wish Cheryl had been somewhat less grumpy this season. She seemed to yell and complain a little more than in the previous seasons. They've always had a nice dynamic, but Cheryl was frustrated more often. Maybe I should cut her some slack, though...she's been with him for nearly 11 years now. Not very women could be with him for that long.

Best episodes: ""The Seder"" and ""The Ski Lift""

Result: not really funny at all, so much as ""interestingly boring."" Just like on Saturday Night Live, the problem with celebrity-mocudrama is EGO, i.e. they are so successful, that they know they don't HAVE to be funny anymore-- and they don't CARE what anyone else thinks; so their only motivation is entertaining themselves, rather than the audience. And with Larry, this manifests in his own fantasy, where he's supposedly obsessed with everyone else's opinion of him being a nice-guy -- because that's the only way he can relate to the audience anymore, but the reality is that he's simply a one-hit wonder but still craves attention, and so he tries to play self-deprecation, but only succeeds in self-indulgence. His ""weird experiences"" which are simply CONDESCENSION-- i.e. that a semi-billionare celebrity like Larry David can suffer the same problems as the ""little guy in the audience,"" like having to deal with the same crap from idiot bottom-feeders despite that he has more money than God.

Why has Cheryl Hines - such an intelligent anchor to the b.s. that everyone else serves up - become such a shrew?  This was a bitterly disappointing development and I hold Ms. Hines responsible due the improvised nature of this previously-funny show.

Unlike the two seasons prior, Season 5 doesn't really attempt an overall plotline linking the ten episodes.  Bad mistake.  There is a nonsensical thread about Larry being adopted and trying to find his birth parents, but it is neither funny nor thought-provoking.

2574196,5,B000FL7CAU,"I find it odd that some posters say this is not a good season...I totally disagree. I find that the later seasons are better than the early ones for this series. In the first few seasons, the level of altercations that Larry got himself into, and the manic quality of Richard Lewis, really kind of grated on my nerves. Suzie, as well. There were just some episodes that seemed to have too much screaming all around for my nerves.

This season is mellower overall, and in my opinion, as entertaining, if not more so, than the previous seasons. I would venture to say it is best season ever, although I missed season 4, so I can't actually say that. This season has all the charm and laughs and quirkiness, less of the screaming. The Jewish/Christian humor is a major theme of this season, and the episode featuring Larry's trip to an imagined heaven, and his trip to his Christian birth parents, were absolutely laugh out loud hysterical. There are some nice cameos by Dustin Hoffman and Sascha Baron Cohen (Borat), and Bea Arthur, as Larry's deceased mother. I also thought the episode where Larry pretends to be an Orthodox Jew hysterical, especially when he he keeps trying to attempt Yiddish. Now that Woody Allen seems to have lost his sense of humor, there are few comedians around who can explore these issues in a funny way.  I also enjoyed the Lesbians episode a lot. Rosie O'Donnell does a good cameo in that one. And, as people have pointed out, the sex offender with golf tips was another highlight. Larry's dad has some entertaining moments in this season also, such as in the sandwich episode and Larry's death episode. Richard Lewis needs a kidney transplant this season, and consequently is mostly portrayed in bed or ill, and thus is not nearly as manic and annoying as he was in the early seasons.

My only complaint about this season, and it is a very small one, is that Wanda Sykes showed up in only one episode. She is hysterical and I would have liked to see more of her...",1180828800,7,1994,4.579831932773109

What I'd give for another episode like the one where he gets his managers daughter drunk; 'I thought she had a speech impediment.'  Or the episode where Larry finds out his mum's dead...  Pure comedy genius.

Shows like Curb, along with it's dramatic HBO equal The Sopranos, suffer unfairly by fans who overhype them in their minds. Once the smoke clears they can be appreciated for what they are.

This season of Curb is no exception to that theory. When it was on, people blasted it. Now it can be seen just as cringe worthy & hilariously uncomfortable as previous seasons. Stand out episodes include The Larry David Sandwich, The Bowtie, The Christ Nail, Kamikazee Bingo, The Ski Lift, & The End (if they really wanted to stop the show with this episode it would be the perfect ending).

If you've never seen Curb though, do yourself a favor & go back & watch it from the beginning. Get to know the Larry character. He has to grow on you. You may love him, you may hate him, but either way you still may have a good laugh. Enjoy! Being uncomfortable has never been funnier.",1159142400,4,973,4.4

2574277,3,B000FL7CAU,"I'm a huge fan of CYE, but I've got to say that series five is the beginning of the end for me. The situations are becoming weaker and less plausible and are only ever resovled with childish bickering or plain shouting. Cheryl is constatntly sour-faced; its difficult to understand why she stays with Larry. Generally, the whole show feels very angry, often for no good reason.

I think the best CYE series offered a window not only into Larry's home life, but the LA TV/ film community as a whole. Without the star cameos and plotllines, CYE now feels a lot like any other family-based sitcom.",1158192000,6,594,4.60377358490566
2574278,4,B000FL7CAU,"I had heard that CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM had jumped the shark with its fifth season, and after watching its first episode, I wondered if the rumors might be true. But I needn't have worried.

I think that what may have happened is that people became overly familiar with the series' highly structured plot formula, wherein Larry ALWAYS gets his comeuppance in the end. But the beauty of the show isn't in seeing the end coming; rather, it's in its wonderful character portrayals and moments of mortification. (I found Cheryl Hines, who plays Larry's wife, to be particularly funny in her reaction shots this season.)

Admittedly, episode six has Seinfeld flashback moments concerning ""bathroom contamination"" of reading material, but most of this material seems really fresh. I thought the  episode where the sex offender is invited to Seder was particularly amusing.",1156291200,15,864,5.1571428571428575

2574280,4,B000FL7CAU,"Larry is still Larry. Cheryl is still pretty (and thinner this season). Jeff is still heavyset. And Suzie is still shrill. Now in its fifth season, Curb is still funny. Larry hasn't run out of ideas, though sometimes he does recycle some Seinfeld jokes about gay people and taking reading material into the bathroom. But any comedian willing to eat edible undies while caught on a stalled ski lift hasn't lost his touch. Larry may now take his place among Basil Fawlty and Edmund Black Adder in the all-time-funniest-yet uncuddly-sitcom-characters sweepstakes. If you like Larry, you'll like season 5. If you don't, well, you're missing out.... Highlights in this season include Kamikaze Bingo, the Ski Lift, the Smoking Jacket, and the episode involving Larry's racist dog. The finale is also good, in which Larry does a funny impersonation of what it means to be a Gentile. Oy!",1155513600,3,879,4.98639455782313
2574281,5,B000FL7CAU,"i was wary about this season, because i thought season 4 was the worst one so far.  in particular i didn't care much for the broadway story line and the humor seemed lacking.  luckily, this season picks back up on the hilarity!  i won't say it's the best CYE season, but it's high quality.  there's only one bad episode in the whole bunch - ""the seder.""  in this episode, larry attempts to make you laugh about him befriending a child molestor and inviting him to a party with children.  now, understand, i have nothing against offensive humor per se.  tell me a good racist, dead baby or michael jackson joke and i will laugh.  however, the joke about the child molestor just simply isn't funny, whether you're offended or not. that said, there is one very funny moment in the episode where larry casually tells cheryl about his child molestor friend and she flips out.  a later episode lampooning the differences between christianity and judaism tackles an offensive subject much more effectively.

i really appreciate the risks this season takes.  yes, it does closely follow the CYE formula.  if you're a CYE fan, you already know what to expect - larry making offensive comments at the worst possible moments, taking advantage of every situation and things coming back to bite him.  but that's not something to complain about.  that would be like saying ""the beatles keep repeating themselves because they're still using electric guitars.""  the real question is, IS IT STILL FUNNY and the answer is absolutely YES.  i'm amazed that CYE has kept this formula funny for this long.  i'm scared for next season!!!  surely it will be old and boring by then..??  i don't know, but nonetheless, larry is a genius for CYE so far.

also:  in season 5, check out dustin hoffman in a very original cameo..  i didn't realize the other cameo star was sasha baron cohen.  it's always great to see the comedian stars show up on the show.",1155340800,6,1927,4.703592814371257

However, if you don't know much about the show and find yourself on this page, my suggestion is that you watch a few episodes first (it airs on HBO).  Chances are, you'll like it, but I recommend you do check it out first as it's not for everyone.  Larry David's dry sense of humor has won over tons of fans everywhere, but lots of people get aggravated and want to punch him through their television set (count me in that bunch).

As everything in TV and movies, some will like it and some won't, but this guy stirs up more dislike than most, so go ahead and make up your mind about the show before picking this up.",1155254400,10,727,4.134751773049645

So much hilarious stuff.  So many good surprises--in storylines, guest-stars, and cringe-worthy moments.

How can it be that this show has not yet won an Emmy for Best Comedy?

Who else is writing such layered, dense (in a good way) comedy?  ""Arrested Development"" came close, but Larry David is the master at this.

You've got to see it.  Especially ""The Christ Nail"" and ""The Ski Lift.""",1155168000,3,426,4.7534246575342465

I do think season 4 was brilliant and I do believe the producers angle was inspiring.seeing how all the threads ended up being beautifully tied together.

After getting this DVD I realize that  season 5 is still really great TV.There are several amazing episodes-The Smoking Jacket is Just great. I love larry nailing the Mezuzah to the door with the nail from the Passion of The Christ,However The Ski Lift is just a brilliant episode-worth the cost of the whole set. The Scene where Heineman's daughter jumps off the lift at the end is just a great summation of the craziness of Larry's life-It could have ended there but it even gets carried over to the next eppisode.

I believe that Curb is our generations Honeymooners-These are episodes (drom everyseason) that can be watched over and over again-totally timeless",1155168000,2,905,4.708860759493671

2574307,3,B000FL7CAU,"I loved seasons 1-4, but thought season 5 fell short of Curb's general greatness. I still laughed hard and often,but much of the comedy was too over the top,even for Curb. Some of the improvised acting by the secondary characters,especially by Kevin Nealon and Richard Lewis was awful. Even Larry seemed out of place at times,but usually still had me rolling on the floor laughing profusely. Though,Jeff Garlin,Cheryl Hines,Wanda Sykes,Ted Dansen and Larry's Dad(in the show)are still top-notch and virtually flawless as always.

The last episode was pretty much god-awful,with the cameos by Dustin Hoffman and Sacha Baron Cohen(Tv's Ali G) being more annoying than good.

This is still worth buying or renting,due to the many hilarious scenes in every episode!

2574308,5,B000FL7CAU,"Curb Your Enthusiasm still continues to make me laugh and cringe at the same time.  Half the time, Larry brings trouble upon himself, other times, he just can't win no matter what he does.  Either way, each episode holds plenty of laughs.
The Larry David Sandwich episode involves Larry getting his own sandwich on the board of one of his favourite delis and it turns out to have whitefish in it which he can't stand.  He tries to switch it with Ted Danson's sandwich.  His father also possibly tells him (he's in hospital after having a stroke) that he's adopted.  Then in The Bowtie, Larry seemingly owns a racist dog, upsets a friend with a lesbian daughter ... I think one of my favourite episodes in this season is the final one with Larry on his deathbed rambling on and on, and then after he passes, seeing him in heaven with his guides (aka Dustin Hoffman and Sascha Baron Cohen) and him arguing with his dead mother Bea Arthur.  It's one of the more hilarious episodes.
It always just goes on and on with him.  The show always brings out good guest stars too.  There is Mekhi Phifer, Mayim Bialik, Ted Danson, Hugh Hefner, Rosie O'Donnell, Bea Arthur and Dustin Hoffman to name a few.
It really is a show with intelligent humour and obviously it's along the same vein as Seinfeld, but in my opinion, slightly better.  Do yourself a favour and buy this now to watch all the hilarity that is Curb Your Enthusiasm.",1154822400,,1420,4.515625

It's a thin tightrope to walk when dealing with matters of religion and people's perceptions of death in a comedic way. Larry walks that rope fearlessly and deftly.

The last episode itself is worth 5 stars! I kept expecting it be resolved with the old ""it was all a dream"" contrivance. I should have known Larry was better than that.

Ignore the critics, Mr. David. Please don't stop raising the bar and making your fans laugh their butts off! You are truly brilliant!",1154476800,9,662,4.546218487394958

It was to Season 1-4 what the Mad TV sketch was to CYE in general.  Larry almost ceases to be a human being in Season 5.  He's not just insensitive, or refuses to suffer fools gladly, he's socially retarded.  He does things that no SANE person-- not merely no politically correct person-- would do.  In previous years, he's the one who's put upon at least half the time, here, it's over the top self parody of a guy with the social graces of a warthog.  There are about 2 episodes funny enough to make seasons 1-4, the rest just don't work.
