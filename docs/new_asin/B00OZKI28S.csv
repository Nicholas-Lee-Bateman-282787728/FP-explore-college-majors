6778511,2,B00OZKI28S,"Bought the set, regret it, can't stand it, will never watch it.  The dialogue sounds like it was written by a crackhead.  Oh, wait....

Sure, The West Wing was much the same although enjoyable because the dialogue took an occasional breath,which seems not to be happening here.

I get it, Sorkin is bright.  He is apparently exuberantly self-conscious of his intelligence and loves to flaunt it.  He finds an audience who takes a certain competitive joy in going along for the trip.  I think it's garbage.",1519084800,,505,4.8023255813953485

6778529,2,B00OZKI28S,"There is no question Aaron Sorkin can tell a story through structure and dialogue.

There simple is no one better.

So I would give The Newsroom five stars...except...its political revenge porn for MSNBC viewers exclusively. If you're part of half the country Aaron Sorkin hates (anyone who doesnt vote Democrat, lives in stupid and adults who thinks angels are real), then this show isn't for you. I watch because each episode can be a masters course in writing. But I really, really, really have to hold my nose as Sorkin takes out his rage through his intolerance of anyone who doesnt believe as he believes politically and lives their lives in Church (Studio 60 was not as political but his disdain for religion pours out of the TV all over the floor).

You can tell Aaron Sorkin grew up on the East Coast and has lived his life on the West Coast. Im sure it makes his skin crawl to fly over Indiana or Ohio, Kentucky or Tennessee when flying back to New York.

Its really too bad. None of his shows benefit from being hateful like this. Just tell a story. Leave politics and religion alone. It really is too bad.",1515456000,,1117,4.514851485148514

6778570,5,B00OZKI28S,"Aaron Sorkin has put this series into a first rate prisrob suction. The first year was iffy, but it got better with each episode.

'Newsroom' season 1-3 has found it's legs, in time.. This series takes place in Atlantis Cable News and Jeff Daniels plays Will McAvoy. It is said his character is a take off of Keith Olbermann, late of MSNBC, though everyone denies it. Gruff exterior with a brilliant mind. He is taken off guard when his producer moves to a new show and takes his staff with him.

Emily Mortimer, plays MacKenzie, an old love and now his new executive producer. Mortimer is the one thing wrong with this show. I don't see the chemistry between she and Will. John Gallagher, Jr., plays James ""Jim"" Harper, a producer who was offered another job when MacKenzie's previous show was canceled but turned it down to follow her. Alison Pill, plays Margaret ""Maggie"" Jordan: an eager associate producer of News Night. She has complicated personal relationships, and she has just come back from Africa and a very difficult situation, and beefs to prove herself. Alison is a true spirit and great actress. Dev Patel plays Neelamani ""Neal"" Sampat, the writer of Will's blog and news scanner of the Internet. He becomes an ncreasingly mportant member of the team. Olivia Munn plays, Sloan Sabbith. She is an economist with a show on the network, and is easily the best of the group. Sam Waterston plays Charlie Skinner, the ACN news division president, and always upset or solving dilemmas. Jane Fonda has a bit part as the owner of the network.

Within the third year, we start out with the Boston Marathon Explosion and terrorists attacks. Neal receives a secret call giving him confidential info from the DOD. This proves to be a difficult situation which may leave Neal in jeopardy. The newsroom is in danger of being taken over, and all of the administration are working to make sure it does not occur. Mac and Will are planning their wedding, and putting out fires here and there. Not much is as it seems. Too many hands in the fire, but an excellent send off. Enjoyed the years.

The Newsroom does for TV News what The West Wing did for the Presidency and the workings of the White House. Excellent writing, educational description of the ethical issues of the people in the Broadcast News Business. An all round excellent series. While I have already seen seasons one and two, I look forward to seeing season three. Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer are excellent actors who deserve all the kudos the show has gotten (Emmy for Jeff Daniels).

6778614,5,B00OZKI28S,"Aaron Sorkin is a creative genius.  The culmination of his brilliance is THE NEWSROOM, the HBO award-winning series about a fictitious cable news network (Atlantis Cable News) and its fiery, dysfunctional crew, led by intense news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels has never been better), Executive Producer MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer), and veteran news president Charlie Skinner (the ever-outstanding Sam Waterston).  Charlie readily overlooks the fact that Will and MacKenzie are estranged former lovers; he only knows that MacKenzie can bring out the best in Will to salvage his foundering nightly newscast.  Sorkin writes intense dialogue that is as riveting as it is often hysterical or brilliant; these characters, and the supporting cast, bring a cable news network to believable life. . .with the background of actual news stories  (e.g., the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico explosion, the 2012 presidential election, etc.) framing the newscasts.  It is TV at its best, and it's a darn shame it only existed three seasons.

THE NEWSROOM - COMPLETE SERIES contains all 25 groundbreaking episodes, along with some deleted scenes, and audio commentaries from Sorkin and some of the cast on a handful of episodes (too few, in this reviewer's opinion).  The final two episodes ('Oh Shenandoah' and 'What Kind of Day Has It Been') are must-see TV; Sorkin knows how to wrap up a story line with an exclamation point.  Plus Sorkin takes you inside each episode to tell you what he was thinking, or what motivated him, to bring the episode to life.  For viewers who crave TV drama at its absolute best, THE NEWSROOM - COMPLETE SERIES is a must-buy; again, it was so hard to say goodbye after just three brief seasons.
