7955621,4,B00005UW9M,"This movie is not very known and it is way better than Once Upon a Time in China 3 thru 5. The movie is directed by veteran director/stuntman Li Chao who is famous for movies in the golden age of kung fu movies in the 70s like Ninja Supremo,Ways of Kung Fu,Cantonen Iron Kung Fu,Fearless Dragons,Kung Fu Beyond the Grave. With all that resume of movies you know your in for an entertaining No Wire Fu movie. The Action is choreographed by one of Lau Kar Leungs Stars who is Hsu Hsiao famous for Monkey Kung Fu,Disciples of Shaolin Temple,Lady is the Boss,Legendary Weapons of China,Cat Vs Rat

 Chin Kar Lok who is famous for starring in Operation Scorpio and in Legend of the Drunken Master,Swordsman 2,No Problem 2. He plays a young Wong Fei Hung this time along with other big kung fu actors like Jet Li,Gordon Liu,Ku Feng,Kwan Tak Hing,Jackie Chan,Sek Kin,Wong Kwan.
This time his opponent is a Japanese Samurai who is played by no other than the famous Lam Ching Ying who has done about 80+movies. His famous work is the Prodigal Son,Hocus Pocus,Heroes Shed No Tears(John Woo),Mr. Vampire Movies,Magic Cop. Wong Fei Hung is out to fight the foreigners from Europe to stop them from having Opium spread to the other Chinese. One of the main bad guys is the underrated actor Suen Gwok Ming,who has also been in great martial arts movies like Drunken Dragon,Shaolin Avengers,Shaolin the Blood Mission,Shaolin Vs Manchu.

This movie came out in 1992 when the Kung Fu genre was dying and there was only Wire Fu used to the extreme like in movies like Swordsman,Zu Warriors,Chinese Ghost Story. The Tai Seng Version comes in many Asian languages and the subtitles are imbedded. Recommend this as a good New Wave Kung Fu movie with out Jet Li,Donnie Yen.",1315440000,2,1752,4.700325732899023
