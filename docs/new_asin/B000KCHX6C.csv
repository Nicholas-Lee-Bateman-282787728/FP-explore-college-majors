8179301,4,B000KCHX6C,"I have a couple of bulging discs in my lower back and as long as I follow the lower back routine, it always makes my back feel better.

it has lower back routine, neck routine and one for strengthening and flexibility for the lower back.  I have only done the lower back routine and part of the strengthening & flexibility  routine.  the only shortcoming on this DVD is there is no verbal instruction for each pose.",1244592000,2,415,4.421052631578948
