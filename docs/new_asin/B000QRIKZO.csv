8298660,1,B000QRIKZO,I purchased this specifically for the David Cassidy segment of the programme but IT IS NOT ON THERE! The DVD says it is 2 hours long - it isn't! It only lasts just over 1 hour. Amazon did replace it with another copy but it was exactly the same! I assume it is a fault with the original production. Obviously if you are interested in a certain segment and it is on the first hour then you will be quite happy but if you want the whole 2 hours don't buy this until you know for sure that you are buying a complete copy.,1234742400,6,518,3.9903846153846154
8298661,1,B000QRIKZO,"This dvd was a major disappointment. They advertised with interviews with David Cassidy and Nick Carter. Neither one was on this dvd. It was also supposed to last two hours. Well, mine was only one hour, so a lot has been left out.",1233014400,2,231,4.395348837209302
