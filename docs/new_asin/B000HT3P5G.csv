2640820,5,B000HT3P5G,"With season eleven, we bring the Korean War to a close with the most watched television program in history. I was a huge fan of M.A.S.H. for many years, often going to the Fox Ranch and walking among the outdoor set. It was really fun to wander around that camp, exploring the tents, the big tin hospital building and the helicopter pad. In the middle of filming season 11, a huge wildfire swept through the hills and obliterated everything in it's path - including the 4077th. The tents were destroyed and the tin hospital building was for the most part melted. The writing staff wrote it into the script for the final episode, doing a fine job at that. Really, they had no choice. The hills were completely blackened. The final episode was very well done. We had seen these characters for so many years - it was such a joyous event to watch them go home. I don't think there was a single dry eye that night. The next day in the newspapers all the political cartoons showed people throwing out their television sets. Exactly.",1163030400,7,1026,4.521505376344086
2640821,2,B000HT3P5G,"I've been collecting the individual episodes, all the time hoping the (shorter) 11th season set would have some extras.  None.  And to top it off Fox has released a mega collection that has the entire series, attractively packaged, with 2 bonus discs - at a fraction of the price. Fox should really offer the 11th season with bonus discs for the loyal customers who have been buying the discs all along.",1162598400,15,403,4.661971830985915
2640822,1,B000HT3P5G,"If you were one of us who purchased the previous 10 seasons of M*A*S*H and would like to receive the Ultimate box with season 11 and the bonus discs, call the following number and state your complaints.  I called FOX video and they ""claimed"" that nobody has called in to complain.  The number for FOX home video is: 888-223-2369.  I spoke with a person by the name of Erica, the manager at the facility is Chantel.  I advise that everyone call to put pressure on them to get this done.  Warner is doing a specatular thing with the Astaire & Rogers Ultimate collection with doing a partial set to be nice to those that bought volume 1.  FOX should definitly do the same thing for the devoted M*A*S*H fans who forked over a lot of money for 4 years!  Place your calls now!  If they would offer at a reasonable price a partial set that includes the 36 disc box with just the DVDs for season 11 and the bonus discs and added materials, I am sure most of us would appreciate it and go for it.  FOX would be a hero if they did it!  Make your calls now!",1162512000,25,1046,4.185
2640823,5,B000HT3P5G,"Hi there Im just wondering has anyone noticed that some MASH episodes have been repeated in past MASH series,Maybe Its me but viewing what is on line for season 11 I have some of these episodes on past series?",1162339200,,209,4.384615384615385
2640824,5,B000HT3P5G,"A final season of a fantastic diverse TV series.  For years I've been waiting for the next season and couldn't wait to complete this set.  Now that time is here, I am sad to see something that I've loved for years is going to end...again.  Back in 2002, I began to collect the series while I was stationed in Korea.  The series began out as a comedy-heavy sitcom and moved more to a more dramatic/comedy series.  Although many have complained that M*A*S*H did less comedy, I believe it more appropriately represents life in Korea.  The last time I seen the final episode I was 10 years old, back then I didn't understand the levity of the episode...but I knew to watch and be apart of history.

Although I am not going to review each episode, I will tell you that this season has covered it all.  For anyone whoever has been stationed overseas or was required to share your personal spaces with others, you'll know what I am talking about.  Hopefully individuals realize that M*A*S*H has shown many characteristics people posses that war and deployments bring about in people.  You'll have boredom, anxiety, sensitivity, and lowered tolerance.  So without a doubt, you must own the whole series, including this one...there is a reason the final episode was the most watched ever--enough said.",1160784000,14,1292,4.774774774774775
2640855,4,B000HT3P5G,"The only bad thing about season 11 is that is was only 15 episodes. It had some of their best work and of course the fabulous final episode ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen"".  As for rating the DVD itself, as you may know,  they subsequently came of with the entire series which included the gag reel, which I would have liked to have seen included on this and all previous DVD's. I won't buy an entire new set just to get the bloopers.",1436745600,,432,4.2560975609756095

The package, the contents, and all are different from what I had ordered.  Now that it is 2 days prior to my Christmas Holiday trip, there is NO TIME to replace this incorrect with the correct item!!!  It does not take the post office over 3 weeks to deliver this package, so I can only believe that you DID NOT SHIP it on the date you said you did, and then to ship the WRONG PRODUCT as well.  This is totally unforgivable.  I would suggest NO ONE EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS VENDOR - EVER!!!!!",1292457600,,665,4.124031007751938
2640901,5,B000HT3P5G,"It's been probably 20 years since I've viewed these original episodes of the classic MASH series. Although MASH has always been one of my favorite series, it seemed that at the time, the show was getting a bit 'long-in-the-tooth' and had run out of steam. I do not necessarily agree with some critics who always parrot the complaint that '(Alda) or the show became too preachy.' So it had a humanistic viewpoint - more emotional than political? Can you blame it? I think one of the truly unique qualities about the series is that over time, it changed. It never pandered to audience whims, but respected viewers enough to make political and character/content changes that were usually subtle and often quite compelling.

Upon a recent re-viewing however, I found this final season remarkably SOLID, funny and touching without too much sentiment. In fact, as much as I enjoy the earlier episodes (seasons 3-6 are my favorites and contain the bulk of my favorite episodes) , I was surprised to realize that THREE of my all-time favorite episodes were in this season: Bombshells (B.J. reluctantly gets a Bronze Star); Give and Take (a general's son dies at the 4077) and Foreign Affairs (Charles falls in and quickly out of love). At this point of the series, the writers were getting away from some of the sentiment and politics of the mid-series seasons, and were focused more on solid and accurate war stories that were more reflective of the times. This season was also more focused on B.J and Potter as well, with some standout performances with a much more commanding Farrell and seasoned Morgan doing the heavy lifting. There are also nice directorial turns by Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan too. In fact, Alda keeps a pretty low profile throughout this season, allowing his co-stars to really shine. And series regulars like Clyde Kusatu and Soon Tek Oh return for some the best episodes of this final season as well. Although this 16-episode season was shorter than the standard 22-24 episode arc, the quality and care throughout each detail is evident. Maybe in hindsight, CBS and FOX would've been smarter to splice up the final feature into weekly installments to give viewers a bit of a break - it was almost too much material to take in! The feature-length finale - PACKED with almost too many story lines -- delivers an episode a bit top heavy in content/changes and historical progression. But it's a minor complaint for a season that is full of good quality performances, funny character moments and memorable programming.",1286582400,,2547,4.882217090069284
2640902,5,B000HT3P5G,I  bought this season of MASH to complete my son's collection of the series. He's very happy with the set. Many thanks for having the series available.,1275696000,,151,4.592592592592593
2640903,5,B000HT3P5G,"A couple of episodes this season are just so touchy feely dramatic that you just want to slap the writers / directors / producers for them. Not that they are bad in and of themselves, but they are just so out of place in this particular story / series.... Not annoying enough to make me downrate this box set, but enough to be glad that they gave up after this year. The Goodbye, Farewall and Amen finale is without a doubt the single best made for TV movie ever. It makes up for the lame ""Who Knew"" episode. (Everybody knows Hawkeye was supposed to be a lech. Why give him a conscience in matters of the heart? It just doesn't fit! The ""Moon is not blue"" episode is another completely forgettable waste of film. The acting and characters were great on that, the story line is just something that they had beaten to death in the first couple of seasons, and making minor changes to it didn't breathe new life into it....",1270944000,,920,4.354651162790698

2640908,5,B000HT3P5G,"I've said it once and I'll say it again.
This was by far the best running series EVER!!!!
The only unfortunate move that FOX made was to release one Season at a time to suck all the die hard fans in and then release a classy compilation (Medicine and Martinis) and tempt everyone to ebay the individual Seasons and spend another $180 for that one!!!!

2640939,3,B000HT3P5G,"Of course the shows were great, just as I remembered them. The problem was with the recording on the DVD itself.  There was one show which was pretty much unwatchable because it would freeze and blur. I have had this experience with other shows in other seasons, but this was the worst.  I have seriously considered asking Amazon if there is some way to get my money back.  And yes, I trouble shot it on other DVD players.

They had room to make social commentary about war and race among other things and they could still do comedy in between. It didn't have to be heavy handed or preachy.

It was like saying good-bye to old friends.  However, since I own all 11 seasons, I can re-visit these friends any time that I wish.

2640977,5,B000HT3P5G,"I've been buying the MASH sets for several years now.  In fact, MASH Season One was the first full-season of any TV show that I purchased.  I adored the first three years - Henry Blake will always be my favorite character - and was saddened to see Frank Burns and Radar leave the show.  After they left, I felt the show lost a little bit of its luster, but I have to admit, that the final season was one of the best.  The producers, directors and actors really pulled it all together for a fitting send-off.  I'm also glad that I didn't buy the recently released complete series set.  I've read some reviews which make me realize that the packaging of that set was less than satisfactory, which is probably why the price was so low.  I'm very happy with the eleven individual sets and am glad that I didn't wait 6 years to buy them all.",1168387200,8,836,4.286624203821656
2640978,5,B000HT3P5G,"The 11th season of M*A*S*H is the final season.  I now own all 11 seasons and the original movie.  M*A*S*H is something that you can watch over and over again with the whole family.  It is filled with comedy and drama and the actors are wonderful.  So many lessons can be learned by watching M*A*S*H.  It was obviously a wonderful show since it ended long ago, but reruns continue to be shown on television.  Owning all 11 seasons is great - you watch it when you want with no commercials.  It is good entertainment for all ages.",1168300800,,529,4.391752577319588
2640979,5,B000HT3P5G,"Let's get this right out of the way.  Yes I do think Fox should give all of us who bought this series, a season at a time, an oppurtunity to get the extras.  After all if it wasn't for us loyal fans buying each season on DVD.  Fox never would have released past season 2.

  But I have to say that I am completely satisfied with every season.  I love the ability to turn off the laugh track.  Also these shows were shot on film, so  seeing them on DVD, is like watching them for the first time.

You can realy notice details you missed on tv.  (i.e how dirty the windows are in the colonels office, or how worn out some of the busses and equipment were.

  This is a great series that stands the test of time.  I originaly bought the series through colombia house on VHS, but had to stop. cause at three episodes per tape, my shelves were filling up with tapes <had 25 of them>  It is nice to have an entire season in just the space of one VHS tape.  Also nice to get an entire season for just a few bucks for then it cost for just 3 shows on one tape.  .",1168300800,2,1055,3.942857142857143

The rest of the episodes are upto the usual MASH standards as well, which means while there are one or two episodes that are a bit boring, overall, rest of them are pretty good.

2641008,5,B000HT3P5G,"This has to be one of the most entertaining and well-loved shows by fans of all ages. Growing up in the 70's and the 80's watching this show with my dad, I never understood the basic tenets of what this show was about but when Fox announced that they were releasing this television series on DVD I knew I had to have this show in my personal library. Alan Alda, Harry Morgan, Loretta Switt, Larry Linville, Gary Burghoff, David Ogden Stiers, Mike Farrell, McLean Stevenson and guest stars that appeared on the show such as academy award winner Ron Howard, beloved Dukes of Hazzard favourite, Sorrell Booke, Ned Beatty and many other more throughout the course of the 11 seasons, making this series the longest running television series with a record 250 episodes.

It's nice to see that Fox had decided to include the 3 hour series finale with this particular set but 20th Century Fox had angered many fans who had purchased the previous sets by announcing a complete series boxed set without allowing previous fans who had bought these boxed sets an opportunity to acquite the bonus features that are only included ihn the boxed set.",1167609600,4,1134,4.7272727272727275
2641009,4,B000HT3P5G,"After spending 6 years buying each season as they were released those of us who were faithful get screwed.  The ""Box Set"" has two (2) extra discs full of extras.  I've spent well over $286 dollars buying these sets.  At the end they release a ""Box Set"" with many extras for a hundred dollars cheaper!!!  I feel like I was taken for a ride.

I hope other devoted fans who took the time to colloect the sets over the past six years raise up and voice their disappointmnet over this treatment.  We should be sent the extra discs for free!!!  Heck, we can even buy them separate if we wanted to.  I've learned my lesson to never buy another set again until the final release.  Lord of the Rings pulled a similar thing releasing new versions left and right.

I am tired of being treated as a chump by these media companies!!!",1166054400,6,820,4.3355263157894735

I am staying calm about this for now, but if Fox knows what's good for them, they WILL make those 2 discs full of extras that are in the box set available to us.  I am going to be optimistic here and predict that they will.  If not, well, this is the last Fox DVD I'll be buying.

Still rated this 4 stars, as it's worth it just for the farewell episode..",1163289600,24,449,3.9555555555555557
2641012,3,B000HT3P5G,"FIRST, I do love M*A*S*H!!  I looked at the reviews regarding M*A*S*H Season 11 and was deeply disappointed to find out that Season 11, when purchased separately, does not include 2 additional discs that are sold with the new 36 disc complete set.  I called FOX and left a nice but concerning message with FOX home video regarding this and requesting them to do something for us.  The number for FOX home video is: 888-223-2369.

Maybe if more loyal M*A*S*H fans who have purchased all 10 Seasons of M*A*S*H called FOX Video, maybe they would make things right for all of us loyal M*A*S*H fans.

Another loyal reviewer noted the following: ""Warner is doing a specatular thing with the Astaire & Rogers Ultimate collection with doing a partial set to be nice to those that bought volume 1. FOX should definitly do the same thing for the devoted M*A*S*H fans who forked over a lot of money for 4 years! Place your calls now! If they would offer at a reasonable price a partial set that includes the 36 disc box with just the DVDs for season 11 and the bonus discs and added materials, I am sure most of us would appreciate it and go for it. FOX would be a hero if they did it! Make your calls now!""

2641014,1,B000HT3P5G,"I own the entire MASH series and I was appalled when FOX released the final season with no extra's hoping those that shelled out over $300 would shell out another $130. This is a trend that all companies are making. Rather than reward loyal customers, they have come up with this game of releasing a watered down version only to release a better version next year and even better the year after that.

If you don't mind not having extra's and just want the show's, then this set is for you.",1163030400,10,490,4.384615384615385
