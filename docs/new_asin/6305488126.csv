Package arrived early and in good condition.  This is an old movie which did not get a lot of publicity, but was very good, with a surprise ending.",1245024000,2,301,7.823529411764706
1035533,5,6305488126,Excellent movie featuring Marlee Matin.  She is a fabulous actress.  I think folks not familiar with the deaf culture might learn and have a better appreciation for the deaf community.,1211932800,14,184,5.1

1035536,1,6305488126,"The film starts off strongly with intriguing by-play between two police detective partners.  But then they're given a homicide to investigate and things decline from there.  The main suspect comes to be a brilliant young female prosecutor, who just happens to be deaf and dumb.  The plot unfolds just too fancifully and unbelievably.  The characters become ever more cardboardy. A shame, since in the early scenes the film did show promise of being interestingly edgy and taut.",1004659200,2,477,5.1558441558441555
1035537,4,6305488126,"It is a pity, that the scriptwriting on this movie did not match the acting. The plot ( a Basic Instinct lookalike )is in itself very interesting, but it becomes too complex, leaving unnecessary loose ends. If the makers had given the movie another ten minutes they might have had a  beter product. Even so, it is a suspenseful thriller that will keep the  attention right to the end. Marlle Matlin as the traumatised attorney and  Jeff Fahey as the policeman who falls for her are good in their roles,  portraying a genuine fondness for each other. This makes the movie in my opinion better than Basic Instinct were  the affection between the leads seemed rather shallow and purely sexual.  Fahey and Matlin show far deeper feelings which gives When Justice Fails an  emotionel depth which most thrillers lack.",952387200,2,811,4.7913669064748206

1035802,3,6305488126,"not that there's any justice in the feloniously corrupt ""court"" system which abrogates the human and civil rights of individuals at every turn but this film was only surficially related to that corrupt system.  Remained unclear beyond the end of the film whether it was the ""communications device"" brother or the lead female who perpetrated most of the murders beyond the killing of her father and herself.  The film was mostly about dysfunctional bipedal hominoids without endearing characteristics.",1468800000,,500,5.397435897435898

1035805,4,6305488126,"Not great.  Good suspense.  One of those movies where you really don't know how it will end till the end. A very complex plot.  Sort of disturbing. Excellent acting.  Music goes with what is happening on screen.  Dialog, and, when appropriate, lack of dialog was also very good.  I think the screen play did the story justice.  Unlike some of the critics, I did not feel at all like I wasted my time staying up most of the night to see this.  I is probably worth a second viewing just because the plot is so complex; but the hints are not hidden, just confusing.  Not to give away anything; but this is one of those movies where your suspicions about who done it keep moving to and from various people till, at the very end you find out.  I was wrong till the last 5 minutes.  I agree that the club scenes were possibly extraneous; but maybe not - evidence hints.  The club scenes pushed the rating up more than the love scene.  Worth watching.",1435622400,,944,4.325714285714286

1035902,1,6305488126,"The acting was negligible at best. Jeff Fahey is a failure as an actor, poor soul. He scowls and gives sideways glances and stomps around and tries to be macho, but it's all for nothing. -- In the movie, his new police partner starts off by announcing he's gay, which did nothing to advance the story line, and then he tries to out macho the role Jeff Fahey plays. Fahey's character decides early on that Matlin's character probably is the bad guy, but 5 minutes later, he's totally convinced she's a straight arrow!  The script could have been written by a 7 year old and would have been an improvement. What a total waste of Marlee Matlin! Even she couldn't save this tripe.",1393977600,2,676,4.495934959349594

It's been noted that it starts off with a lot of potential then quickly jumps off into 'what the %^* H* am I watching this for?'.  If they would have left out the totally laughable club scenes and spent that time on building the relationships...maybe.  Just maybe  Oh well, I wasted better time doing more stupid things than this - but I'm not going to start any self-examination on why that may be.  I'm sticking with 'okay'.",1391126400,6,519,4.364583333333333
1035904,1,6305488126,"Sourly disappointing.  Both FAHEY and MATLIN are big bores. I could barely stay awake, and counted z's through a lot of it - there simply wasn't enough excitement.  AND the end?
