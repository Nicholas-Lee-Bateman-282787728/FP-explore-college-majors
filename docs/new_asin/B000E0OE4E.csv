2476284,5,B000E0OE4E,"I had the opportunity to see this movie when it came to town with the whole momentum experience thing. Great Movie! It should have been released to theatres normally but they were trying out a whole new idea of spreading movies to urban areas which was successful.

 Kelly Rowland of Destinys Child does a fantastic job in this movie. She kills it and the songs are great!! and she should have good career in Hollywood now thats shes done with Destiny's Child.

Duane Martin also does a good job. De Ray Davis and Co as well. it is a good movie to buy and to have as your collection. I would give it 5 stars. Nice, funny movie.",1139961600,18,627,4.296610169491525

2476290,4,B000E0OE4E,"Both Kelly Rowland and Duane Martin portray their characters believably and appealingly in this entertaining romantic comedy. DeRay Davis is hilarious as Martin's roommate, and Melanie Brown also puts in a solid performance as Rowland's assistant. The story is well-paced, for the most part. Things seem a little bit rushed toward the latter part of the movie; but the music selections provide a consistently pleasing backdrop. I especially enjoy Rowland's performance of ""I Need a Love"" and wish that the song would be made available in full for purchase!",1398211200,,556,5.258426966292135

2476296,5,B000E0OE4E,I bought this for one reason and one reason only. Shemar Moore was in it and he was very funny in this movie. He should do more comedies.,1356825600,,137,3.9285714285714284

I don't want to give the movie away, but if you are looking form some good fun and great entertainment, this is the movie to see...

Well happy watching/movie night.....",1275523200,,339,4.2153846153846155
2476301,5,B000E0OE4E,"I really enjoyed this movie because it had a great musical background and theatre approach to it. It showed a star who was looking for love with a busy schedule as well and finds it with a man who is struggling to get his lawyer degree and pass the bar exam. He is seat filler with his friend who plays the woman that he dates.
When the two meet, they are instantly attracted to one another and begin to date. The singer however has just ended a relationship with a gorgeous black man who is self absorbed and does not pay her enough attention. He digs into the history  of her new prospect and brings the dirt back to her.
The ending is great however because of the turn of events of which I will not tell...you gotta buy the movie. (smile).",1267315200,,742,4.225352112676056
2476302,2,B000E0OE4E,"I couldn't even watch this movie all the way through. I am gonna try to watch it again, but the start of it is what is supposed to grab your attention. Nothing kept me into this movie.",1202342400,,184,4.0
2476303,4,B000E0OE4E,"A seat filler has it pretty cushy, his or her sole task merely to keep warm the seats of celebrities and big wigs at award functions. This is so that there aren't embarassing empty spots when the cameras pan by. There are a few rules to the gig: no cell phones allowed, you can only clap 5 times, your heinie can't be too warm. And the cardinal rule: you mustn't ever, ever fraternize with the stars. Sounds like easy money. But not, as it turns out, for Derrick Harver.

At the Videobeat Awards show, struggling law student and part time seat filler Derrick Harver (Duane Martin) gets seating duties next to famous and lovely singer Jhnelle (Kelly Rowland of Destiny's Child). Shattering the no fraternizing rule, Derrick engages her in a fleeting conversation, and the two instantly click. So she falls in love, and he falls in love. But a misunderstanding leads Jhnelle to believe that Derrick is some big time entertainment lawyer named Alonzo Grant. And now Derrick's cornered himself into keeping up a pretense. You know she'll find out, and you can guess how it'll all turn out. Question is, is the picture worth sticking around for as it goes thru its been there, done that paces?

Yes, it is. THE SEAT FILLER is a romantic comedy which came out in 2004, and it is modest and engaging and unpretentious. And much, much funnier than I expected. True, the film is lightweight and utterly predictable, but the acting and comic talents of the cast achieve a kind of grace which effortlessly overcomes the flaws. Earnest, down-to-earth Duane Martin and sweet songbird Kelly Rowland ignite romantic sparks, while Deray Davis and Melanie Brown (formerly Scary Spice of the Spice Girls) shine as Derrick and Jhnelle's respective best buds. Deray Davis, in particular, made me laugh a boatload of times. Dude is some kind of hysterical! Even Shemar Moore's jerkweed, third-person-referencing character garners some chuckles (but not many).

Again, much of the film's charm is directly linked to the two leads. Martin and Rowland are very good together, and we can't help but savor their characters' relationship as they experience the highs and lows of being newly in love. Of course, there's also that Cinderella fantasy element lurking about. The average guy landing the beautiful celebrity. Now, I realize that once the seat filler plot device had propelled Derrick and Jhnelle together, its job was basically done. But, still, I wish there'd been more of a focus on the seat filler aspect and its role in the various award shows. I'm just being selfish, though, because I really wanted to see the Latin Gospel Awards, as hosted by Chuck D. The Honky Tonk Music Awards, I probably would've passed up on.",1192579200,,2705,4.863340563991323
2476304,1,B000E0OE4E,"Listen up reader.
If you're thinking about buying the Seat Filler because you believe you may enjoy it because it stars Duane Martin or Kelly Rowlands, don't read any of the other reviews, because they have been written by people who work for this movie's production company. They have a biased reason for wanting you to purchase this movie.

This is one of the worst movies made in the history of movies. They spent zero money in the making of this movie. Every aspect of this film is bad and it's mainly because they didn't take any time or money in even purchasing the right cameras or lighting equipment. The plot of the film is one big cliche and it's really freaking corny.

Don't read of the other reviews, they're all fake. Anyone in their right mind knows this is a cracker box, cheaply done, totally cliche movie.

But, if you're into stupid movies, movies that are unrealistic, than this movie may be for you. Maybe you like stupid movies. My brother does , he says they make him forget about his day. Silly, two-bit movies are sometime fun to watch.

I'm not saying don't buy the movie, although I'm not giving many reasons to buy it though. I'm just saying, don't read the other reviews, they are clearly biased to anyone who has seen it. This is not a good movie but maybe you're into that.",1192233600,,1304,4.489451476793249
2476314,5,B000E0OE4E,"Kelly Rowlands does a wonderful job portraying her character Jhnelle in this, endearing film.  Duane Martin has you rooting for Derrick, because it's not hard to relate to his situation.  Sometimes, it's easier to be someone else than it is to just being yourself!  The chemistry between the two is sweet.

Look forward to seeing more from Ms. Rowlands in the near future, both musically and theatrically.

I highly recommend this one.",1171929600,4,435,4.986111111111111
2476315,4,B000E0OE4E,Check it out.,1168300800,,13,3.6666666666666665
2476316,5,B000E0OE4E,This movie was hilarious. Even though singing is what Kelly does on a regular basis she really put her all into this movie. The first time I saw the preview was at the Destiny's Child concert. Though it was only playing at Imax theatres in certain areas. I was upset. I was going crazy looking around for this movie. It later came DVD almost a year later.  I finally found it and laughed from the begining to the end. D. Ray is silly along with Dwayne Martin. They couldn't have done better with the actors and actress's they choose for this movie. It will be money well spent....,1166832000,4,580,4.37037037037037
2476317,4,B000E0OE4E,"Kelly did a much better job here than Mariah in Glitter, but she ain't Beyonce in Dreamgirls either.  She does a good job at playing a famous singer who falls in love with a guy who is a seat filler at an awards show.  This gives her the perfect opportunity to let us hear her great pipes again but on a solo level.  The chemistry between her and Derrick (Duane Martin who I love in All Of Us) is believable and fun and while this movie might appeal more to chicks, I think it has a wide age appeal.

I dropped a star due to the fact that it's totally predictable, but overall, this is a really cute movie that I recommend to hopeless romantics and those who want to have a laugh.  (Also good for Kelly Rowland fans because there are plenty of reminders that her then new album would drop soon).  I like it and hope you do too.",1166832000,2,827,4.105590062111801
2476318,5,B000E0OE4E,I'm from Australia and many movies like this don't even make it onto our video/dvd hire shelves so I didn't know what to expect! But I absolutely love this movie and can watch it over and over... its such a feel good movie :o),1162425600,3,226,4.159090909090909
2476319,5,B000E0OE4E,"I really am a romantic at heart; I got to see this movie finally the other night and I really liked it; I liked the fact that there are still romantic films out there that appeal to folks like myself; Now, I didn't care for the fact of what Duane did; taking over someone else's identity to get someone who could be the love of his life; He should have come clean with her because love cannot grow on deceit.but all in all, it's a great movie.",1162080000,4,443,4.103448275862069
2476320,5,B000E0OE4E,"I thought this movie was DAMN good. It was a pleasure to watch and very nicely directed. Kudos to Kelly Rowland. This was the first time I've seen her in a movie and she's done a wonderful job (Others may disagree), but who cares.

Nicely done",1159056000,3,243,4.282608695652174
2476321,4,B000E0OE4E,"This movie was your typical Boy Meets Girl, boy falls for girl, girl dumps boy, boy makes a fool of himself and wins girl back story.  But what made the movie good was DeRay Davis.  Yes Kelly Rowland and Duane Martin were good and had great chemistry but DeRay was hysterical.  He added a great sense of comedy to the movie.  One thing that could have been added was more lines for Kyla Pratt, she is an good actress and would have brought a nice dimension to the movie.  But all in all this was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend it.  Hats of to Will, Jada, Duane and Tisha for creating the Momentum Experience it is definately much needed in the African American community to see positive love stories that don't look like they were made on a low budget.  This film definately had the look and feel of a ""real Hollywood movie"".  Oh yeah Shemar Moore was definately funny in this movie.",1157500800,2,893,4.36969696969697
2476322,5,B000E0OE4E,"I think Duane and Kelly Rowlands both did their thing in this film. It was an enjoyable and tasteful film about true love and how people can connect during the strangest moments. Kelly is truly a beautiful and talanted woman, and I wish her the best in life. It was simple, but good, and once in a while we need films like this to escape horrid films like that Killer cam movie...what was he thinkin. But I truly did enjoy the seat filler. I laughed and smiled.",1147910400,4,461,4.310344827586207
2476323,5,B000E0OE4E,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child, especially Kelly Rowland. I was very pleasantly surprised by the depth of this movie. It's acted with vivacity and true emotion by all its stars, and it contains moments that make you laugh out loud, as well as times when you want to cry.
Duane Martin stars as Derrick, a broke college student studying to be a lawyer, and who's desperately seeking a job. He is prodded into being a seat filler, someone who occupies the places of absent people  to make the audience look complete at awards shows, by his hilarious best friend E.J. (played wonderfully by DeRay Davis). While filling in for a famous entertainment attorney, he meets the gorgeous and charismatic pop star Jhnelle (Kelly Rowland). Before either of them know what is happening, they're falling in love with each other. Perfect, right? Wrong! Jhnelle thinks he's Al Grant, the famous attorney, and has no idea that he's just a seat filler. Derrick doesn't want to lose her love and trust, so he has to do everything he can to keep her from the truth, with a little (well-meant but very unhelpful) assistance from E.J. Other stars include Melanie Brown (that's right... Scary Spice!) as Sandie, Jhnelle's best friend, and Patrick Fischler as Irwin, her crazy manager. The DVD also features awesome deleted scenes, and an extended performance of Kelly's great tune, ""Follow Your Destiny."" My only complaint for this film is that it doesn't have a soundtrack, with complete versions of her other amazing songs in this movie. Nevertheless, I would encourage anyone who loves a good, romantic comedy to check this one out!",1141171200,11,1640,4.857142857142857
