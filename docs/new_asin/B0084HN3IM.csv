8525116,5,B0084HN3IM,"This is a very high quality DVD of some of the great voices of early R and B and soul. Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price and Ben E. King three of the really big names of those genres with way too many hits to name. Gene Chandler was also part of the show doing Duke of Earl among others. I was lucky enough to see this tour and the DVD brings back great memories of this tour. If you are a fan of these artists would highly recommend buying this concert.",1482105600,,446,3.966666666666667
