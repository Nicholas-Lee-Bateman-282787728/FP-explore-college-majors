7802710,5,6165001548,"In the 2011 Japanese Family/Drama Dog x Police: The K-9 Force, the thriving metropolis of Tokyo is besieged by a series of deadly bombings.  As a profound sense of fear grips the city, brave first responders mobilize into action.  Among them is a young maverick police officer, Yusaku Hayakawa (Hayato Ichihara), who dreams of one day becoming a detective like his father.  Unfortunately, his loner personality and reckless actions while pursuing a suspect at one of the bomb sites, does little to impress his peers.  Hayakawa is transferred to the Metropolitan Police Departments 2nd Security Division Equipment Unit 4, the departments fledgling K-9 Unit.  Here, hes paired up with Shiro a White Shepherd whos shy and slow to adjust to life in the K-9 Unit.  Primarily tasked with training security dogs in detection, apprehension, and Search and Rescue work, the unit is sadly viewed as a tact kennel rather than an invaluable asset in dealing with dangerous criminals.  Determined to change this mindset is veteran handler/instructor Natsuki Mizuno (Erika Toda) who reluctantly takes the pair under her wing.  Together along with a motley pack of dogs and handlers, Hayakawa and Shiros partnership grows as their bond is put to the ultimate test when a cunning and psychotic serial bomber raises the stakes in a deadly game of cat and mouse that puts civilians and members of the K-9 Unit in harms way.  To stop his reign of terror, it will take the actions of a courageous cop with a badge of honor and a loyal dog with a heart of gold.
 This is one of the best portrayals of a police K-9 team!  Special features include behind the scenes featurette and trailers.
