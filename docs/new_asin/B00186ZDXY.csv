What a great workout; I have never had anything work my legs like this does and the best part is it's not hard on the knees.  You can see a preview of some of his training on youtube: Tim Michaels Body Balancing. When I finished my workout today and began to walk around, I could really feel that I had a great workout. If you have had a difficult time training your legs, this will do it.

I have the Legs DVD and the Back DVD and they are both so good that I am buying the others. What I like about this trainer is he is extremely well schooled in form and everything is done with precision.",1242172800,,658,3.9323308270676693
