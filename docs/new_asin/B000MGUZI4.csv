8169022,4,B000MGUZI4,"This movie is another one of my favorites , i was looking for it long time, actually i own a vhs format of this movie but i want the DVD format, then a couple weeks ago i found this movie in Amazon and quickly  ordered it ,as soon as i got it i saw the movie, the transfer to DVD is good , the sound is a little low but those were minor problems, because the grand problem is the color!!

the original movie is in technicolor ,but the DVD is in BLACK & WHITE ,course that broke my heart, maybe a day someone will do the transfer in technicolor,until then i gave 4 stars to this DVD.",1179705600,3,582,3.9237288135593222
