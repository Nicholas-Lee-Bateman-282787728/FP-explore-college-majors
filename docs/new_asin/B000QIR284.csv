8196512,5,B000QIR284,"In Neopolitan-italian, with standard Italian subtitles, this tele-film would be difficult to understand for those viewers who can't read and understand italian.  For those lucky ones who can, it will provide a very unique and wonderful viewing experience.  It is about a Neopolitan family (Cupiello) and their neighbors during the Christmas season (Natale) and their particularly quirky personalities.  It is presented like a stage play, as Eduardo is most known for theater.  It has an existential, dark comedic feel to it, which we rarely see in most films.  Eduardo De Filippo is so beloved in Italy (and by non-italians who appreciate his work) that he is usually referred to by his first name only -- ""Eduardo.""  Only artists of the highest achievement earn this right.  Eduardo is among the best, and is certainly quite unique and profound as a writer, director and actor.  It would be worth mastering the italian language simply to experience his amazing tele-plays.  Bravo, Eduardo!  Highly recommended.",1481155200,,1011,5.22360248447205
