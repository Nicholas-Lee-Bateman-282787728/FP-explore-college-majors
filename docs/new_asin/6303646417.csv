700682,5,6303646417,"The finest aspect of this film and of the creation of Stuart Smalley in general is Franken's parodying of that sappy self-help/12-step rhetoric that invaded the language in the '90s and is so pervasive now that only the more ludicrous coinings are even noticed. The plot and Stuart are ultimately charming here, but the rhetorical satire could easily be transposed to a much darker context; people who buy into this rhetorical rubbish and spout it are generally horrifying morons -- perpetually ""working on"" truly loving themselves.",997142400,2,532,5.1976744186046515
700683,5,6303646417,"The absolute best SNL film ever made.  And if you think they can't do drama, think again.  I think Al Franken and Harold Ramis should be very proud of this superb film. It stores the best acting, directing, and writing of any SNL film to date.  To get a good idea of the film, it's about 40% comedy and 60% drama.  So if you wanna have a few good laughs and a pleasant feeling when rewinding(or going back to the menu you DVD freaks), this is the flick for you.  How Al Franken isn't hugely famous yet is beyond me.",983750400,8,515,4.11
700684,5,6303646417,"I thoroughly enjoyed this spoof of the recovery movement, especially because it blended the serious aspects of addiction and dysfunctional families with the often morbid humor that is also within these topics.  As a social worker who has worked with many who have ""walked the walk"", I have tremendous respect for them but also know that humor is one of the key ways they chose to cope with their situation.  Al Franken does a wonderful job of reminding us that, indeed, you can't just ""talk the talk"", you do have to put your money where your mouth is and eventually step out of the cliches and twelve step mumbo jumbo and just be who you are.  Very appropriate for most ages, this is actually important viewing for children or adolescents who might be growing up in an alcoholic home.  Thanks, Al Franken.",976233600,15,806,4.654929577464789
700685,5,6303646417,"Stuart Saves His Family is not your typical SNL movie. It's not packed  with laugh-a-minute jokes or high strung humor. It's more of a drama where  Stuart tries to save the people he loves the least: members of his family.  In the skits, he is irratating and annoying. But in this movie, the viewer  will respect him more as a sensitive human being who needs a friend like  anyone else. And we find out that he has friends that you can't just find  in any old 12 step program. They are loyal and understand him. Especially  Julia. She doesn't pre-judge him. Everything Stuart goes through, she goes  through it with him. Everyone deserves a soulmate like that. You also feel  for what Stuart is being put through by his family. Stuart is human (with  some minor considerations) just like the rest of us. This movie helped me  get through the rough times I had in my family. It is also probably the  first SNL movie with an ending that can bring one to tears. It's okay  though. The mark of a good movie is in the the ending. Stick around during  the credits to listen to the music. There is a song on there called  ""What Makes A Family"". It's quite good.",968198400,23,1154,4.377358490566038
700686,3,6303646417,"This is one of the least known SNL spin offs, but also probably one of the bests. It's not only hilarious, but it's a also a good drama. This is the first for a SNL dramedy. Al Franken is a hilarious and the whole cast is  great as a totally dysfunctional family. I loved this movie, I always will.  I can never get sick of this one.  You have to see this one.",958867200,3,360,3.904109589041096
700687,5,6303646417,"Al Franken scores with ""Stuart Saves His Family"".  Expanding on his SNL character, Franken paints Stuart's wildly dysfunctional family with broad, knowing brushstrokes.  Humor and honesty take the audience inside  the world of 12-step recovery.  I'm buying second and third copies of the  movie to use in counseling with families. ""Denial isn't just a river  in Egypt!""  This movie slyly slices through the excuses and gently  reveals the healing hearts of folks with the courage to take that first  ""step"".

700688,5,6303646417,I both laughed and cried while watching Stuart go through life in recovery. This is a movie any 12 stepper can relate to.

When you see how sincere Al Franken plays Stuart, you know he had to have been ""there"" with the rest of us therapy-bound human  beings. The other copies I have bought I gave to friends on the condition  that if they liked it, they kept it, if not, give it back to me.

700976,4,6303646417,"Al Franken, the current senator from Minnesota, drew the Stuart Smiley character from SNL sketches he had done in the 90s. The transformation of his own character for that role is remarkable. But while I value Stuart's struggles with low self-esteem and tendency to accept the role of a loser, I cannot say that I understood the motivation of this somewhat inconsistent, effeminate personality. He often came across as too goodie-goodie to be totally sincere. He reminded me of a drawing of the Happy Face. Be that as it may, watching this film was not an unpleasant experience. 3 1/2 stars",1475884800,,590,4.851485148514851

700978,5,6303646417,"This movie is under appreciated and I think largely because it's got a lot more seriousness in it than a typical comedy.  The performances are quite good.  For a character I never quite cared for, Franken does a great job in this and Ramis does his typical great work.  If you're just looking for wacky comedy, this probably isn't it, but otherwise, wow.",1475366400,2,354,4.587301587301587

The humor in the movie very much echoes that from SNL, but we now get a glimpse of Stuart's family and why he became the self-help addict we saw in the sketches.  Admittedly, the movie has a few flaws which is almost always prevalent when you take a sketch character and draw it out for 2 hours: it does drag in some places when the drama is featured.

Granted, it is funny in spots,and there are some excellent performances by all members of his family, especially Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother. The strange thing is, now this movie is also an excellent example of how alcoholism can tear apart a family. I know what you're think, how is this funny? If you remember the Stuart Smalley bit that Al Franken did on SNL, that routine is used as just a rough framework for the movie. The real story of the movie is how Stuart deals with the alcoholism that is slowly (and literally) killing his brother and his father. This movie portrays alcohol addiction probably better than most movies that start out to seriously portray this addiction but then inevitably get sidetracked by smarmy soap opera-ish subplots. Stuart is himself a mental wreck and then to have him thrown into the fray whereas he has to try to save everyone in his family makes for a fairly interesting, and sometimes quite funny, movie.

What helps to make ""Stuart"" a more-successful Lorne Michaels endeavor is the stellar supporting cast.  Laura San Giacomo, Shirley Knight, and the always-wonderful Vincent D'Onofrio are just a few of the talented actors in this movie.  The first time I sat down to watch it, I doubted that the somewhat-annoying Stuart Smalley character could support an entire feature film.  But Al Franken (screenwriter/Stuart), director Harold Ramis, and the great cast, do an excellent job of keeping the story and characters engaging.  The storyline is believable and relatable, and I found myself less annoyed by Stuart once I knew his back story and saw him interacting with his family.  Franken succeeded in making Stuart a three-dimensional, feature-film character.  He could just as easily have mindlessly transferred over a two-dimensional television character who had only appeared in 5-minute segments.  Luckily for us, that wasn't the case.  Since I first saw it in the '90's I have watched this movie every chance I've had, but until now I could never find it for sale at a reasonable price.

I was in a 12 Step Program - Al-Anon, the first time I saw this movie.  Believe me, it 'hit home hard'!  It is exactly what 'we' 'Stuart's' want to do with our families. Ha! Yet we come to know that it is impossible to make anyone do what 'we' think is best.  There are so many families in America in the same situation as this movie...believe me, a lot of families are just like this. There is always a 'caretaker', 'enablers' and then the 'addict'.

This movie did not get its 'just desserts'...It is one of the BEST MOVIES ever made!  I do wish more people could have had the opportunity to have seen it and I know it would have won many awards... OSCAR MATERIAL...
Why are and how does the movie industry determine what is and what is not good enough for an OSCAR?  They sure missed the boat here. It was done perfectly and the actors were each perfect in their parts.  It made you laugh, cry and feel the pain of what Stuart was going through. Oh how I wish it could have made it to the 'outside world'.  It would have been the best and most talked about movie in 'history'!

701926,5,6303646417,"One of my all-time favorite movies, and not just because it's funny and I like Al Franken.  This movie came out during the self-analysis/study-in-codependency trend of the 90's, a very helpful time period for 'dysfunctional' people (i.e. everyone).  Throughout, the movie is filled with useful aphorisms, such as ""stinkin' thinkin'"" ""shoulding all over myself"" and ""trace it, face and erase it.""  The writing expertly creates the Smalley family dysfunction (alcoholism, verbal abuse and drug addiction), how it is maintained via enabling, denial and dishonsty, the effect it has on Stuart, and the daily effort Stuart puts forth to break free and overcome it.  The movie has uproarious moments of family dysfunction to which everyone can relate, such as disastrous family vacations, funerals and official documents.  There are touching moments of truth that actually bring tears to your eyes.  And finally, the movie is filled to the rim with unique characters, some heinous and hairless, some fragile and overly-apologetic, some who have found their strength.  And then there's Stuart, who is so much like all of us, still struggling, still failing, still falling, but always getting back up, taking a look at himself in the mirror, and always affirming: I am good enough, I am smart enough....Watch it.

And while the scenes with his overbearing boss are played to comic effect, anyone who has anxiety will be able to relate to his struggle to stand up for himself.

I loved all the ""12-step"" cliches. This movie really made me think that we are all dysfunctional in varying degrees, but putting the focus on healing our self, and not trying to change those around us that choose to stay in the insane world of abuse (alcohol, drugs, etc.)

Stuart Saves his family is an overlong extension of a SNL skit about ""Stuart"" the over twelve-stepped psychological casualty of our continuously self-indulgent selves. Rather than overcome his traumas, Stuart nurses them like a bacteriological growth in an inner Petri dish. He stumbles through a series of activities where his therapiezed world view provides conflict with others functioning normally (operating thetans), and abnormally (everyone in his family). I never really got the works of LRH, but his paranoia about ""the Psycholos are coming"" pretty much sums up the character Stuart....this is the kind of human being you get after all that.

But this is not gut-busting humour. This is light comedy that makes you think, and does have an unobjectionable uplifting element.",1199232000,,1035,5.331288343558282

It's especially disappointing because I was actually an extra on it (when I was rather young, and I didn't make the final cut, which isn't why I dislike the film).  The film was a chore to sit through, another example of taking an SNL sketch (a memorable one, mind you) and stretching into an 85 minute bore.  It doesn't help that Franken, who I never thought was hilarious, is not a great lead actor and he can't really carry this film.  He's a decent writer who is quite overrated in my opinion (and rather smug on his radio show).  The film tries for seriousness at times, but then Stuart Smalley is so silly and over the top, you're not sure what the filmmakers intended.  Despite the fact that the actual shoot was very, very enjoyable, the result here is very poor and disappointing.

702120,4,6303646417,"Stuart Saves His Family is an underated movie that had so much to say, and said it very well.

While I dislike Al Franken's politics, this movie really hits the nail on the head in regards to dysfunctional family relations.

Frankly, I was curious if the cute recurring skit could last as a movie.  While it got rave reviews, fans stayed away.  Too bad.

Stuart Smalley (Franken) struggles to keep his Daily Affirmations show on Chicago's Public Access Television.  He is a member of several 12-step groups, but not a licensed therapist.  When he loses his show, we meet all his sponsors for the various 12-Step Groups.  They are people who provide support, love, and listening ears.

Juxtaposed is his dysfunctional family who he tries patiently to love--and even change.  As we meet his alcoholic father, overbearing mother, wasted brother, and ditzy sister, we understand how Stuart got the way he did.

In the end, Stuart realizes that he cannot change his family, but only himself.  Once he does that, it leads to mending fences with his brother.

This movie is not a typical SNL movie.  It lacks the slapstick violence of the Blues Brothers, the quirky one-liners of Tommy Boy, and the humor and homage of Wayne's World.

What it does, though, is deliver a very good movie.  Cinematically, the acting, directing, and writing are top-notch.  This is a mainstream comedy, that everyone can identify with.  We all want to fix the shortcomings and sins of our families.

At the same time, it makes us laugh at the dirty laundry.  One of the best parts is when Stuart explains that the Smalley family is not good with resolving conflict--because of the alcohol.  In another scene, he resists drinking a beer with a couple of hot heads, then tries to tell them to reach for their ""inner child.""

The best scene is when he does his opening statement on his show.  ""All my life I heard 'Stuart you're not smart enough.  You're not good enough.  And by the way, nobody likes you.'""

""Do you know who said those things?  My mother?  Yeah.  My Father?  Well, him, too.""

It's too bad this movie flopped--but all the true fans have made it a box-office smash in their hearts.",1135641600,9,2169,4.6888297872340425
702121,4,6303646417,"Like the much-maligned Ishtar, this is a movie no one saw because reviewers kill good movies. Well-written, with a top-notch cast, this is ""dramedy"" at its best. Stuart is a character found in a lot of families, I know there are ""Stuarts"" in mine. (They just don't write as well as Al Franken and therefore aren't quite as amusing).  I was surprised to be touched by an SNL movie but Stuart's journey is sweet and moving.  Of course, as other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't your typical SNL piece.  I think it didn't do well because it's cross-genre and kind of ""thinky"" - at least compared to any other SNL movie ever made.  Bottom line: a fun piece of entertainment you could watch with anyone from a pre-teen to an elderly person - and not be cringing at violence or uber-sex.",1131321600,5,787,4.52112676056338
702122,3,6303646417,"*

Having just come off of the 'reading' section, reviewing the 'audiobook' version of ""LIES And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"" I felt I'd do Mr. Franken a good turn by reviewing this movie as well. Why? Because, quite honestly, I'd never considered Al Franken to be that much of a comedian/satirist. I still feel that way for the most part; but as so many here have already said, this movie is something of a rare gem -- made rarer by the fact that the studios who produced it limited its theatrical release and its 'promotional budget,' so it never had much of an initial audience. In the end, however, that's not necessarily a bad thing, because now those same decisions have positioned this movie to potentially become a 'cult favorite,' given enough time & exposure.

Prior to finding out about this movie just a little over a year ago, I had no knowledge of Al Franken's career in film or sitcoms -- or much of anything else prior to his book writing & radio talk show involvement. The only thing he had ever done that was even halfway memorable to me from his ""Saturday Night Live"" days was when he would periodically appear with Jane Curtain on the show's ""news"" segment (""Weekend Update""), appealing to the audience to ""...Find out what you can do for ME, 'Al Franken'."" Not even his ""Franken and Davis"" skits imprinted themselves on my memory.

And I had *never* heard of ""Stuart Smalley"" until a ""certain someone"" began derogatorily referring to Al Franken this way. I was first made aware of this name after a CSPAN2 broadcast of a ""BookTV"" expo wherein a very perturbed Bill O'Reilly, who did not appreciate being labeled a ""lying liar,"" blew-up in front of everyone in attendance and, by extension, in front of the nationwide audience. Since that event, Mr. O'Reilly began to belittlingly refer to Mr. Franken on his radio and television ""Factors"" as ""Stuart Smalley.""

Curious to understand O'Reilly's reason for applying this name to Franken, I found myself doing some research, whereupon I learned for the first time that ""Stuart Smalley"" was an ""SNL"" skit character created by Franken -- a sheepish, somewhat effeminate and over-drenched in 'hyper-positiveness' ""self-help"" guru. Inevitably, my delving into it would cause my attention to stumble across this movie based on the ""Stuart Smalley"" character.

""Yeaaaahhhh...... Riiiiiiiiggggghhht......."" I thought to myself -- ""An ENTIRE movie (which I had NEVER heard of) based on a character (whom I had NEVER heard of) that appeared in variety show ""skits"" (which I had NEVER seen and was totally unfamiliar with) -- and, besides, Al Franken????"" And even though I thought it would be a nice non-violent way to 'beach-slap' Bill O'Reilly as my own individual response to his irritating obnoxiousness, there was no way I was going to waste good money for something (at an 'undiscounted' price, even) that would only later make me feel like a fool for doing so.

But, as always, I read the reviews of others, and came away with the impression that MAYBE these folks knew something I didn't. These were, for the most part, clear-headed movie-lovers and critical thinkers -- they weren't ""Franken-Groupies"" lauding Mr. Franken because he's ""Al Franken"" (""groupie"" type reviews revolving around any actor/director/etc. are, for me, an instant warning sign to tread very carefully). The points, personal testimonies, genuine emotion, etc., expressed by the reviewers touched something in me, and against all better judgment I put this title on my order form.

Is it a 'great' movie? Well..... no.

Does that mean it's not a 'good' movie or that I'm not impressed with it? Absolutely not! I really did enjoy this movie; loved its uplifting (albeit saccharine) message; I even found myself able to 'identify' with the over-the-top (or is that 'under-the-bottom'?) Stuart. Franken, surprisingly, makes it easy for the audience to root for Stuart and to want to see him ""win.""

And, yes, it is quite funny -- not so much in the ""gut-busting"" hilarious way, but more in a 'cute' and 'self-exploratory' way that makes us 'laugh at ourselves' while not even being aware that what we ARE in fact doing is laughing less at Stuart and his dysfunctional family and more at ourselves and our own dysfunctional families. (A stroke of genius on Franken's part? -- Or just a lucky stab in the dark? -- We may never know.)

So just how impressed and satisfied was I with this movie? Enough to send an email to Mr. Bill O'Reilly to personally THANK him for 'bringing it to my attention' (true story) -- although to be more accurate, he pointed me in its direction.",1121040000,13,4611,4.869897959183674
702123,5,6303646417,"I saw this movie for the first time two days ago. It ran at midnight, and I stayed up to watch and record it purely because I knew Vincent D'Onofrio was in it. I wasn't expecting anything startling, but I was pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable it turned out to be.

Al Franken was very watchable in the role of Stuart Smalley - the (mostly) positive title character who goes on a journey of discovery and learns that despite his best efforts and intentions, the only person he has the power to save is himself.

Laura san Giacomo was pleasant in the role of Stuart's sponsor and friend and my main reason for watching, Vincent D'Onofrio, made the experience well worth depriving myself of sleep.

While the film deals with some serious issues in the midst of the steady comic overtones, it doesn't shove it hard into your face. And while it's clear that Stuart isn't going to succeed in everything he attempts (his father is far too content with the way he is to want to change, even with the threat of jail hanging over his head), there are some small successes that make it worth the effort.

The most touchings part of the movie (for me, at least) is Stuart's reconciliation with his older brother, Donnie (played by D'Onofrio). And just how positively Stuart has influenced his brother's life is perhaps shown in the final scene of the movie.",1118707200,6,1354,4.582644628099174
702124,4,6303646417,"I remember the Stuart Smalley sketches from ""Saturday Night Live"".  They used to back-end them on the show after the news where the less funny sketches were left to die.  This is not to say ""The Daily Affirmations"" were not funny, just mildly amusing tweekings of new-age 12-step programs that went down easy but eminently forgettable.  What amazes me about this film is how remarkably it has transcended it's roots as a 5-minute sketch into a wholly satisfying feature film.  Opening Stuart's character up to a larger world has done wonders.  It succeeds in showing the crisises that Stuart confronts both personally and professionally, namely, he loses his cable access show and his dysfunctional family is falling apart.  These turmoils are not only humorous their poignant.  Unfailingly, Stuart confronts these problems with all the lessons he's learned in self-help programs.  You can also say that this film is a great time-capsule of the nineties when 12-step programs were all the rage though, to the film's credit, it does not mock these programs that have been helpful to so many people.  Al Franken doesn't skip a beat in transferring Stuart from the small screen to the large screen.  He is abetted with a strong supporting cast that includes Laura San Giacomo, Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Lesley Boone.  Amusing cameos from Joe Flaherty as Stuart's sleazy Uncle Ray and Julia Sweeney as a secretary with mother issues.",1112400000,5,1456,5.07563025210084
702125,5,6303646417,"There is something special about this movie.  I rented it after reading something positive about it in the paper (I had never heard of it).  During the first ten minutes I thought, ""I can't spend an entire movie with this character"" (I had stopped watching SNL years before, and didn't know the Stuart skits).  And then Stuart started to grow on me.  He's such a sweet, ordinary, messed-up person who keeps on trying.  The best movies have drama and comedy in them, and this film balances them beautifully...like the best Preston Sturges movies.  It has real heart and warmth, and it is very funny.  I watch it every couple months, and it warms me like visiting an old friend.  It's not for everybody, but it has goodness in it and that's a tricky thing to have in a movie, especially these days.",1103500800,11,796,4.556338028169014

Any grown-up out there (belonging to a dysfunctional family) still trying to stay with the concept of ""family holiday gathering"" should do what Stuart ultimately did in the end.",1034467200,8,457,4.481927710843373
702128,5,6303646417,"Sadly, a lot of folks have never heard of this little gem.  It had a very short theatrical release but has been gaining a wider audience, largely among members of 12-step programs, through its various video releases.
To describe the story line of this very funny movie would be to sell it short, because the premise doesn't sound like it would lend itself to such a delightful comedy.  But the film grabs one's attention from the very beginning with its montage of 50s and 60s family photographs during the opening credits.  Are these possibly family photos of the lead actors at an earlier stage of life?  When Vincent d'Onofrio's name is on the screen, the guy in the photo looks an awful lot like him.  And then we're off and running, with Stuart telling us on his television show that he has just received a sweater that one Melissa D. knitted for him.  Melissa is a recovering sex addict and knitting the sweater ""gave her something to do with her hands.""
From that point on, the pace only rarely slackens, as we are introduced to Stuart's various friends and nemeses, beginning with Roz Weinstock, very possibly the meanest and most sadistic boss since Captain Bligh, and deliciously played by Camille Saviola.  Roz has fired Stuart for maligning her on the air, and she is only the first of a series of people Stuart manages to annoy as he lives out his affirmation of ""I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, doggone it, people like me.""  Perhaps not everyone likes him, certainly not the customer in the restaurant (an unbilled role, possibly director Harold Ramis?) who has to wait while Stuart explains his latest predicament to his best friend and Al-Anon sponsor Julia, wonderfully played by Laura San Giacomo.
From there, it is a constant back-and-forth for Stuart between Chicago, where he lives, and Minneapolis, ironically one of the chief centers of recovery programs, and the home of his very dysfunctional family.  Stuart's beloved Aunt Paula has died, setting in motion an ever-muddier chain of events that eventually teach Stuart in a big way that the only one he really has the power to change is himself.  Nevertheless, the ever-optimistic Stuart continues to offer his gifts to others, some of which are eventually picked up and appreciated.
Just as the setting goes back and forth from Chicago to Minneapolis, so the time frame goes back and forth from the present to the past through black-and-white flashbacks, some happy, some less so.  These give us some idea of how Stuart has come to be the way he is today, and of the ghosts that he has to grapple with while living out his affirmation.
The film does take a rather serious turn near the end, but Al Franken as Stuart Smalley helps to keep the tone somewhat light during this section.  And, as in real life, not all the loose ends ever get neatly tied up, but Stuart has nevertheless made his impact, as we see in a very heartwarming ending.
While most of the actors in the film are not household names, a number of them are quite experienced and turn in some memorable performances.  Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Lesley Boone and Vincent d'Onofrio are all good as Stuart's family members, the men in particular.  There are also a number of memorable cameos, particularly Julia Sweeney as the constantly apologizing Mea C., and Walter Olkewicz and Jeremy Roberts as the Skoag brothers who try to force the teetotaling Stuart to drink beer at a bar.
The music is fun also, beginning with the codependent song that is played during the opening credits.  And it was great to hear Ethel Merman blasting her way through ""Everything's Coming Up Roses,"" during one of the scenes where Stuart is trying to pull himself up by his bootstraps.
This picture has some of the funniest lines I have ever heard in any film.  My particular favorite is Stuart's brother Donnie's attempt to define for him what an ""easement"" is, despite the fact that he obviously doesn't have the slightest notion.  But many will like even better Stuart's comment to his sister about the pound cake.  While there is plenty here for audiences in general to laugh at, there are also a number of jokes that are targeted toward members of 12-step programs, and especially those programs geared toward helping friends and family members of those addicted to alcohol and drugs.  It's obvious from the writing that these are topics near and dear to screenwriter Franken's heart.
So, I recommend this movie with just the caveat that you will find it funnier and closer to home if you have some familiarity with the programs that the film gently pokes fun at.  And even if you don't, after seeing the film you may still wind up with a new approach to life.",1016150400,35,4694,4.736196319018405
702129,4,6303646417,"Al Franken brings Stuart Smalley to life in this movie.  Stuart is struggling with his own self-destructive tendencies, and is an unlikely hero in the perils of his own dysfunctional family.  Laura San Giacomo is convincing in her role as Julia, Stuart's al-anon sponsor and friend.  Stuart's dysfunctional family includes an alcoholic dad, 30-something pot-smoking brother who hasn't left home, enabling mother and a codependent, over-eating sister.  He struggles from situation to situation.  He is crushed by the loss of his public access television show, and humiliated by his boss, but he keeps on trying.
It was clear that Al Franken and director Harold Ramis did research on 12-step groups rather than have a shallow spoof of them.  He enlisted the help of best-selling self-help author Melody Beattie (Codependent No More).  This movie is much more than a very funny comedy.  It is a drama filled with tried-and-true values:  friendship, perseverance, and integrity.  When I am feeling low I can watch this movie and am genuinely built-up.  I have told myself more than a few times, echoing Stuart's words, ""I'm good enough, smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!""  Another quotable saying from the movie is ""It is easier to put on slippers than to carpet the whole world.""
This is a movie that I decided to buy rather than just rent.  Although I agree that the SNL character might have been grating, this movie's Stuart is not annoying and can be watched over and over again.",1012867200,8,1491,4.963709677419355
