6266978,5,B00IJZW35I,"On January 18th, 1975 a new situation comedy was spun-off from the #1 rated TV series in North America, ""All in the Family"". That show was ""The Jeffersons"". Premiering on CBS ""The Jeffersons"" quickly became a huge hit with audiences and for the first time ever (even before ""The Cosby Show"") the sitcom showed African/Americans living like many white Americans: with money, a beautiful apartment (a deluxe apartment in the sky) and the leads were hard-working, yet enjoyed the best of life's riches. Louise and George were loved by audiences and along with their maid Florence and son Lionel as well as friends Mr. Bently and Tom and Helen ""The Jeffersons"" became a television institution.

 If you couldn't afford the first DVD releases of ""The Jeffersons"" (like me) the series is being re released again. In this set you get the first two seasons (season one was half a season) with a total of 37 episodes!!!! And the price couldn't be better!!!!",1397779200,10,948,4.845679012345679

But before the season was completely over with in the 2 season they regained what made the Jefferson's the great comedy that it was.

6267012,5,B00IJZW35I,"Norman Lear is a genius and perhaps the most influential voice in television history. He broke ground by developing the controversial ""All in The Family"" to critical acclaim, accolades, and huge ratings. To me, ""All in The Family,"" is the best comedy series ever only on par ""I Love Lucy."" The Bunkers had African American family, the Jeffersons, as neighbors. Lear had already spun off ""Maude"" and ""Good Times."" ""The Jeffersons"" moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan and never looked back.

Lear had an eye for talent and casted Sherman Hemsley as George Jefferson. Isabel Sanford was cast as loving wife Louise. Mike Evans played their son, Lionel, until he left to do ""Good Times."" His successor, Damon Evans, did an adequate job in the role. When ""Good Times"" was over, Mike Evans returned to the role after Damon Evans vacated it. The Jeffersons have a lot to learn living with the upper crust. Lionel's girlfriend, Jenny Willis (played by Berlinda Tolbert), is the biracial daughter of a white father, Tom Willis (Franklin Cover), and Helen Willis (Roxie Roker)!African American mother. The Willises live in the building. Paul Benedict plays Harry Bentley, a British neighbor. Zara Cully plays Mother Jefferson. Marla Gibbs was wonderful as Florence Johnston. Ned Wertimer was best known for playing doorman Ralph.

The first two seasons displayed the series humor and dealt with difficult issues involving interracial marriages, a rare topic on television in the mid seventies. Unlike ""Good Times,"" this series didn't have the problems about the show's depiction of African Americans. This series was probably the first series to show successful African Americans like the Jeffersons only a decade before the Huxtables. The series didn't shy away from touchy subject matters. The series lasted a season and could have gone on more since it was the network's decision to cancel it.

The first two seasons featured guest appearances such as Robert Guillaume (Benson & Soap); Oscar winner Lou Gossett; Maidie Norman; Leon Ames; Ernest Thomas (What's Happening?); and more too.

I'll never understand why there were two different actors playing Lionel but it didn't matter to me.  Zara Cully was a treasure as mother Jefferson. Isabel Sanford was the first African American actress to an Emmy award for outstanding leading actress in a comedy series. She was also awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before her death. Sherman Hemsley was inducted into the Television Walk of Fame upon his death.

The series was funny, sharp, witty, and still relevant today. It had a great cast overall.",1432684800,,2603,5.0843091334894615

6267027,4,B00IJZW35I,"A funny, clean classic. All lovable characters suitable for the whole family. The only ding I have about this purchase was the packaging. The 3 discs are ""stacked"" on a single spindle making the discs susceptible to damage over time. I would have gladly paid an extra buck for a flippable insert giving each disc their own holder but I guess I'll go out and buy a 3-disc case and switch everything over. Other than that, it's still a worthy purchase and I'll continue buying future releases should they do so.",1415923200,4,509,4.604395604395604
