5771929,5,B00D3LA6BQ,I loved this movie!! This was the funniest movie! The second story was awesome!! Lots of big names!! Loved it!!,1373932800,2,111,4.6
5771930,4,B00D3LA6BQ,"This movie isn't something you should let your children watch. It's star-studded by some of the biggest actors in recent film history and while you think they'll be prevalent throughout the movie- they're not, at least visually. Pay close attention to little details, as each of the stories is tied to the next, because that ending will have you gasping in your seat. The first story is hilarious, Paul Walker's accent as a hillbilly is on point! Make sure you keep your eye out for that Elvis impersonator too! This movie isn't one of those blockbusters and it isn't meant to be one, if you watch it, do it with that in mind. It's not meant to keep you on the edge of your seat but rather to keep you laughing. If you get into it enough, you'll want to rewatch it for anything you may have missed.",1373846400,9,798,4.398648648648648
5771931,3,B00D3LA6BQ,The beginning of the movie was great but then it crashed and I didn't know where the plot was going. Paul Walker and Norman Reedus is the only reason I watched this movie.,1373846400,,171,4.212121212121212
5771932,3,B00D3LA6BQ,"""I went into a pawn shop and found it. It was like God brought me there."" Alton is the owner of a local pawn shop. One day a kid comes in with a ring to pawn. This innocent event triggers something that affects many people including a group of meth addicts, an Elvis impersonator, and the original owner of the ring. I really like this type of movie. Movies where one event connects a wide variety of people and the stories all end up converging. They are fun to watch and are usually well written. The best of this type is obviously Crash but there have been others. That said, this is watchable, funny and entertaining but nothing amazing. The best part of this movie is Brendan Frasier as Elvis, it took me a while to realize it was him, but he was really funny and great in this. There is some really dark humor in this but there is also main stream humor, there is a little bit of everything in this. I liked it but it's not something I think I would watch again. Overall, funny and entertaining. A fun one time watch. I give it a B.",1373673600,,1038,4.195
5771941,5,B00D3LA6BQ,"awesome flick. Well cast and love seeing Brendin Frazier. He did a great job. You can't go wrong with these disturbing, but funny movies like this and really well acted and Paul W. went deep. I did not know he had that in him.",1505347200,,226,4.159090909090909

5771943,3,B00D3LA6BQ,"I suspect that the filmmakers were actually making fun of non-Louisianians for their stereotypes of Louisianians. It does seem that way. That, I like. Whether it was deliberate or just more Hollywood ignorance, it was so overwrought that they accomplished a great show of just how moronic those stereotypes are. The flick (""flick,"" not ""film,"" in this particular case) is filled with hillbillies, in a state that has no hills; an event at a county fair, in a state that has no counties; and every overwrought stereotype of a southern jackass and/or accent ever invented by Hollywood, and very few people who sounded anything like a Louisianian. This flick was almost interesting, but it fell very flat on the humor and grindhouse atmosphere that it mimicked. I watched it, because I loved the ""why do we hate the..."" scene in the first vignette, and because the inaccuracies were so over the top that it must have been a deliberate rip on the ignorance of non-Southerners. I live in Seattle, I'm from Louisiana; believe me, there is a LOT of ignorance about the South, and these idiots are vehement about it.

Five stars, because they did such a good job of making fun of non-Southerners for making fun of people they know nothing about. One star if it was not deliberate. Three stars for boredom and flat jokes. So, average it out to three.",1503100800,,1341,4.755364806866953

5771975,5,B00D3LA6BQ,"Wacky was never so wonderful.  It takes a scene from the movie St. Vincent with Bill Murray to even begin to approach the totally crazy, demented, and bizarre humor in this movie.  Be warned, this thing isn't for your every day, routine viewer.  Most would describe parts of the story as more than a little disturbing.  It takes someone who's been around the block more than a couple times to absorb some of the scenes in this movie w/o being totally offended in the process.",1452470400,,475,4.552941176470588

Three separate story lines weave their way through this strange, but stimulating, film anchored at an out-of-the way pawn shop. Forget what you know about this talented cast of actors because you are guaranteed to see them in roles that you never imagined - and they all deliver spot-on performances. Get up, get out of your comfort zone, and give this film a try. If you are disturbed by cursing, off-color humor, sex, nudity, bondage, torture, or drug use...don't watch this film. If you're willing to suspend social judgment for a storyline that will make you look at your neighbors and co-workers and wonder if you've ever really known them, you might just enjoy this. Think This Is the End. Think Hot Tub Time Machine. Think serial killer. Think Neighbors. You won't know whether to laugh or to puke.

5772025,5,B00D3LA6BQ,"Let me start off by saying that this is maybe the most genuinely fun dark comedy I've seen in a long, long time.  The three stories were all excellent, with great performances by Matt Dillon and Paul Walker (worth watching just for the way he moves his fingers).  On the surface, this movie would seem analogous to a dinner at a Chinese restaurant; that is, thoroughly enjoyed but quickly forgotten.  Yet, many deep questions keep coming to mind regarding one of the movie's core themes:  Salvation.  Specifically the characters of ""The Man"" and the Preacher.  ""The Man"" shows up in a pickup truck, looking like the Marlboro man dressed in black and offers salvation in the form of a shotgun.  The recipient of his largess quickly puts the shotgun to deadly use, killing his backstabbing buddies along with himself.  In contrast, we have the Preacher man, dressed in white, who hangs around a local restaurant called ""The Fire Pit"".  He has the ability to seemingly appear from nowhere and hands out pamphlets that appear to have Satan drawn on them.  Oh, and he goes around making deals for people's souls.  In contrast to ""The Man"", the result of the Preacher's dealings are pretty benign.  Thanks to the Preacher, Ricky Baldowski (the Elvis impersonator) can suddenly belt out a version of ""Amazing Grace"" that is good enough to make old enemies (like feuding barbers Doc and Cook) make up.  So, who is offering salvation and who is offering damnation?  Is the point that we can't tell the difference?  Darned if I know.",1403654400,6,1523,4.781609195402299
5772026,5,B00D3LA6BQ,"This is a great indie effort that tells three stories that are all linked by objects that have wound up in a down market pawn shop. There are three stories in all and they are all brought together during the course of the film.

The first tale is of some meth addicted white supremacists. Their story centres on a pawned shotgun and features a brilliant performance from Paul Walker playing the marvellously named `Raw Dog. There is a brilliant scene where him and his bro discuss the politics of being a white supremacist and find they come up a bit wanting.

Then tale two takes us on a dark ride with Matt Dillon who finds a ring, in the same shop, that had belonged to his missing wife. His search for her is ruthless and unveils a very unsettling surprise - with Elijah Wood playing a role as far removed from his Hobbiting days as one can imagine.

The trio is completed with Brendan Fraser giving a bravura performance as one of the World's worst Elvis tribute acts. He must have had a blast playing it and that pays off in what turned out to be the biggest surprise of a film so far this year - absolutely recommended.",1400803200,,1126,4.37799043062201

Hours. What a small cast masterpiece. I can't believe he wasn't at least nominated for an award for this
Into the Blue. Ignoring the eye candy aspect of it, it had real heart, a logical plot, and was plain fun. And who doesn't love the entire cast? The entire cast was just a class
 Running Scared. I can't praise this film enough. I wish I could erase my mind, and see this film again for the first time. If there was one film I wish I could re experience for the first time, this would be it.

Then comes this film. I didn't realize until 3/4 of the way through it that it was the Running Scared director. I loved it. It isn't quite the same level of Running Scared magnificence, but it is 90% there. I personally feel the end let the film down, mainly Elijah Wood's character.

Despite being compared to Pulp Fiction in style - this was more like a trip into Blue Velvet - Twilight Zone territory.  But it lacked bite.

I actually like this movie, there are 3 stories connecting them all in a small way, but they are different stories by themselves. I thought that the first story was great, and the second story was good, and the last story was my least favorite. I think the last story was my least favorite because it didn't make sense at the end. One of the characters in the second story actually supposed to dead, but you see him in the third story at the end. This confused me and it shouldn't been that way. So, that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.

5772075,3,B00D3LA6BQ,"PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is not really a good film, yet despite its problems, it is intriguing, weird and quite entertaining.

Some viewers have described the picture as ""a redneck version of PULP FICTION,"" but I think that's a stretch.  Essentially, the movie consists of three unconnected stories, told separately yet all supposedly taking place at the same time, that lightly intersect along the way.  What they do have in common is that, for the most part, they all begin at a rural Louisiana pawnshop run by Vincent D'Onofrio.

In one story, a trio of goofy white-supremacist drug addicts decides to rob a meth lab, but the plan goes awry when one of them (Lukas Haas) pawns their only gun in order to buy enough gas to get there.

A second, much darker tale begins when a newlywed (Matt Dillon) discovers a unique ring in the pawnshop that belonged to his first wife who disappeared six years earlier, sending him on a violence-filled search to find her.

The final story concerns a down on his luck Elvis Presley impersonator (Brendan Fraser), who makes a life-changing decision when he comes to a small town to play the local fair.

Written by Adam Minarovich and directed by Wayne Kramer, PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES contains a number of ethereal elements that are never satisfactorily resolved.  Indeed, expanded, each of the three stories has a strong enough premise that they would probably have worked as a separate film.  Having them ""touch shoulders"" in this movie seems like a forced effort.

The cast, when you can decipher their Southern dialects, is first-rate.  They include Elijah Wood, Thomas Jane, Norman Reedus, Pell James, Chi McBride and Paul Walker.

PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES is available via Anchor Bay Entertainment in both a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack and as a separate DVD.  The sole extra is audio commentary by the writer and director.

5772076,5,B00D3LA6BQ,"Alton (Vincent D'Onofrio) runs a pawn shop in a small southern town. It provides the connecting link for three stories which are also loosely linked. The first tale involves the misadventures of crack heads wanting to rob their manufacturer. The second tale involves Richard (Matt Dillon) attempting to track down his long lost wife (Pell James). The third involves a down on his luck Elvis impersonator (Brendan Fraser).

This could be described as a grindhouse, ""Creepshow"" style. The episodes are clever dark comedy, marvelously written, directed, and acted. For those like their films on the oddball Tarantino side, check this one out. Yes, it had me laughing out loud, especially the first episode.

Warning: Film contains scenes of captive women who had been abused and treats it on the light side.
