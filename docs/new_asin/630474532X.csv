921281,5,630474532X,"First of all, this DVD is very cute, the opening theme song is very catchy, and the english dub voices are great. I enjoyed this DVD, and when volume 2 comes out, I'm gonna buy it. It all starts when Yuusuke starts living on his own. On his way to school, he find a naked Noelle sleeping in the forest. When he comes home, he finds out that Noelle's family has come from the monster world to live with him! Everybody keeps calling Yuusuke Noelle's ""husband"" because he accidentally kissed her. All this is getting to be too much for poor Yuusuke. Noelle wants to be an angel just for Yuusuke, but there are many things required. This dvd cotains the first 5 episodes:""Kisses Mean I like you, I think,"" ""Patched Up Love is Okay with Me!"", ""Hug Me, Squeeze Me,"" ""Precious Things are.....Precious!"", and ""Not There, But Still There."" This series would be great for children ages 8 and up!",1041120000,2,885,4.503105590062112
921282,4,630474532X,"I saw this at the AnimeExpo in New York recently, and bought it soon after.
The plot (understand, Japanese cartoons sometime have quirky and erratic plots)is: A stork carrying a new angel is attacked, and the angel inside splits into 3 parts. We won't know what happened to the other 2 parts for a while, but one apparently ends up in the demon world and raised by the Munsters, for want of a better description.
A teenage boy whose parents have left him in Japan while they work overseas is enjoying his first day of independance when he comes across a girl naked in the park; this girl is Noelle, one of the pieces of the complete angel. She immediately falls for Yu-ske and declares him her husband. He considers her nuts and runs away to school, where she ends up at later as a student.
Later, when Yu-ske rides his bike home, he finds the Munsters have re-decorated his house (did they ever), and Noelle is part of this family. He's introduced to them as her future husband, and they inform him they're moving in, having left the demon world. Strange stuff, and not just the obvious. The family has dances for practically every occasion.
Meanwhile, there's an evil...Harliquin that desires Noelle because she's imperfect (he has a thing for imperfection) and stops at nothing to have her in his possession. Of course, this involves numerous kidnap attempts by his minions and the family's battles against them. Again, funny and wierd.
I'm glossing over a LOT of stuff, but that's the beauty of Anime; so much goes on in just 1 episode you look at it more than once.
The disc comes with both the original Japanese and English dubbed. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the better dubbing efforts by far, sticking very close to the original translation. Moreover, Noelle's voice actress for English is a dead ringer for the Japanese one, which is great.
The animation is clean and smooth, with abstraction only when the story calls for it.
This series is great for kids 8 and up; just a tad risque in some places, but always in good taste and never overt. Parents who are already into similar things will enjoy the quirkiness.
Definately worth purchasing.",1031270400,12,2160,4.657068062827225
921283,3,630474532X,"If you like Chow Yun-Fat, you will like this movie! I bought this movie first on vhs. The vhs is wide screen with chinese subtitle, and english under it. When they put it to DVD, they made it fit to television (ie not widescreen). In doing so they
cut off the english subtitles. IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHINESE DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS, UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A BETTER VERSION!!",1028678400,17,374,4.357142857142857
921284,5,630474532X,"This is an unbelievably incredible series which has yet to really receive its due from American anime fans. The original Japanese title is ""Tenshi ni Narumon!"", which roughly translates to, ""I'm Gonna Be an Angel!"" The title is appropriate, but at the same time pretty deceptive. This series is definitely NOT your run-of-the-mill cutesy kid anime. While it does have more than its share of kawaii elements, it also has a very deep and very dark subplot which is foreshadowed in the opening seconds of the first epsiode. This darkness erupts in the middle episodes, and it practically explodes in the final story arc.
Describing the show is a little tricky. It features a high school boy named Yuusuke and a girl named Noelle, who just happens to wear a halo. As the series starts, Yuusuke is on his first day of living by himself, and he's quite happy about his freedom. On his first day alone, and on the way to school that morning, no less, he ""stumbles"" across Noelle in the woods (okay, he falls off of a bank and lands on her). She is naked and unconscious, for reasons that are too complicated to explain. Suffice it to say that when Yuusuke lands on her, he accidentally kisses her, and this of course wakes her up. She immediately assumes that Yuusuke is now her husband (so will her family - more on that later). Yuusuke runs away in a blind fear, but his problems have just begun.  So has the series, in fact - all of this takes place in just the opening minutes of the first episode!
By the end of the first episode, we learn that Noelle is now a student in Yuusuke's class, and that her ""family"" has moved themselves (and their entire house!) to the spot where Yuusuke's house had been. We also learn that Yuusuke has a crush on another girl (Natsumi), even though she won't spare him the time of day because of several unfortunate and embarrassing incidents. It is during his attempt to apologize for one such incident that we hear Yuusuke compare Natsumi to an angel: Noelle, upon overhearing this, later pledges to become an angel for Yuusuke.  The series centers upon this pledge and how everyone handles the consequences it creates.
The dramatic side of the series is excellently offset by its comedic side. By far, the funniest part of the show involves Noelle's ""family."" They're from the ""Demon World,"" and they can only be described as a cross between The Munsters, Bewitched, and a Fisher-Price commercial. The father is especially funny in the original Japanese series: he's an enormous Frankenstein's monster who wears glasses and a business suit, and he speaks in an *extremely* polite Japanese dialect. The mother and grandmother are witches, the brother is a vampire, the little sister is a mad scientist in training, and the big sister is invisible. The whole family is extremely naive as to the ways of the ""human world,"" which invariably results in trouble for all (usually at the expense of the humans involved). As strange as these characters may seem, they're mild when compared to the ""villains"" of the show. All of the characters are eventually developed to a degree that you normally won't see in a series like this, and none of them (especially the ""villains"") are what they would at first seem to be.
The first 7 or 8 episodes (out of 26 total) are heavily laden with slapstick, but like I mentioned earlier there is a very deep plot that stirs slowly throughout. There are two major story arcs later on in the series that must be seen to be believed: one happens right in the middle, and another that spans the last 5 episodes. The ending arc is especially impressive, and is in fact the only piece of anime that has ever moved me emotionally. Seriously - it is REALLY that good.
In short, this is a series that you can't afford to miss, and one that is bound to go down as a classic of the genre. Incredibly good stuff, and a must have for any serious anime fan.",1008201600,30,3903,4.60632183908046
921285,5,630474532X,"""Chow Yun Who?"" Were my first thoughts when my friend produced this dodgy-looking tape of some obscure-sounding Hong Kong film. Being, at that stage, very new to this sort of movie, I was somewhat sceptical.
However, the following two-or-so hours were awe inspiring. The opening scene is amazing, with Chow Yun being extremely cool and demonstrating his godly gamling prowess.
Whilst cleverly avoiding the unfriendly attentions of a gang of thugs he's just humiliated and relieved of over 10 million bucks, our hero falls into to a trap. Set as a plan for revenge on someone else, by three small-time gamblers, the trap causes Chow to lose his memory and gives him the mind of a kid. Under the care of the trio, the man's amazing gambling ability is discovered and they use it to thier advantage...
This film rocks from begining to end. Despite the cheesy elevator-music version of ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" that keeps poping up in the feel-good sequences, it is more than compensated for by the heroic theme music that play eveys time Chow Yun is doing anything cool. ""God Of Gamblers"" combines slick gambling and action-packed gun battles with a clever plot, to create a masterpiece of Eastern cinematography.",987292800,2,1221,4.932038834951456
921286,1,630474532X,"I wish someone else had mentioned this, but this is a horrible trasfer of a great film. The video picture quality is very poor and made from a very scratchy film print. on top of that you will most likely NOT be able to  read the subtitles (unless you can read Cantonese)as they are cropped off  the bottom of the screen. Different televisions have different overscan  rates (they amount the crop off the edges of the picture you are watching).  This problem may not be as bad on another t.v. set,  but the amount they  were cut off on mine was far greater then the standard differences in  overscan across different t.v. manufacturers lines so I doubt you will have  a different experience. This is usually NOT an adjustable feature. Wish I  had better news to print.",942192000,7,768,4.547445255474453
921287,5,630474532X,"When I heard this movie, decided to check it out and found it very entertained. It combines comedy, drama and some action styles from John Woo's Action Flicks.  I must praise Chow Yun Fat for his performance,  because I have never seen anyone who could act as a 10 years old as Yun Fat  did in ""God of Gamblers""...strongly recommend you to check it  out!",940032000,4,354,4.4
921288,5,630474532X,"What can I say...this movie shows just how cool Chow Yun-Fat can be in all situations.  One moment he is a great gambler, the next moment he is a child (a cool child to say the least), then he is an expert killer...yes,  all this in one movie.  Just having him on the screen makes this movie  good.  Do you want to learn how to ""bluff"" in a card game and get  away with it?  If so you need to watch this movie and take notes.  Wong  Jing picked the correct person to play ""The God of Gamblers"" in  this movie...not like all the other sequels and prequels he made later (an  exception to this would be ""God of Gamblers Returns"" where Chow  Yun-Fat reprises his role as...you know who).  Everyone should own this  movie...it will teach you how to eat chocolate in a cool manner.",925862400,3,776,4.226027397260274

Outstanding! Unique in its premise, humble with its humour, and ripping with its action,  this one stands as one of Fat's more bizarre (read: good action sans Woo)  films. You know the story from reading the other bits here, but just in  case you need further proof, I had to throw in my two cents.
Plus, this  film also features (God, why can't I remember his name?!)as the  arse-kickin' Mr Dragon. Well worth seeing just to see him take out a gang  of would-be assailants in a passenger train!
Buy it! Learn how to yell  ""Chocolate"" in Cantonese! See two-fisted action in gambling  parlors! I've run out of exclamation points!",922665600,,762,4.551470588235294

7876888,5,630474532X,"Initially when I watched this series in it's fansub form, I was only mildly intrigued. I'd had it recommended by a online friend of mine & decided to give it a try for the first 2-3 volumes. While I thought it was cute, I immediately dismissed it after a few episodes as a cutesy anime that I'd complete if I had the time. A few weeks later I was looking for something new to watch & picked the episodes back up to view. Boy was I glad that I did! I immediately became enthralled with the series & collected the rest of the episodes. When I discovered that the series was coming to DVD, I immediately preordered my copy of the first volume.

The story surrounds a cute little girl Noelle who is discovered in a very fanservicey fashion by plain everyman Yuusuke. After some initial confusion, she immediately proclaims that she's his bride & soon after declares that she'll be an angel just for him. Along for the ride is her very eccentric & colorful family, some of which are supportive of her goal, some who are not. Meanwhile, a very mysterious boy and interesting enemy both watch her progress with interest.

The show is very cutesy & could initially be mistaken for just a children's show (which is what I did at first). However, as the plot moves along, the more adult elements of the show begin to appear in the last few story arcs (which unfortunately never made it to dvd).  Sadly, due to the terrible marketing & distribution, the final episodes are unavailable in any official format in the US.

Would I recommend this? Yes, but only if you are into very strange, cute, or quirky animes. Some won't be willing to give it the chance (assuming that this just isn't their type of anime to begin with). I would somewhat recommend it to older children, but only if the parents watch it first. The series is harmless, but full of semi-risque jokes & fanservice.",1209859200,,1868,4.501474926253687

7876890,5,630474532X,"A friend showed me his fansub for Tenshi Ni Narumon, and I instantly fell in love with its pink swirly hearts, wacky characters, and most of all super-hyperactive Noelle. I was so happy when Synch-Point picked up this series. At first it seems real cutesy but I promise, there is substance to this show. The characters are well-established right away, and the fifth episode -- which focuses on Noelle's ""invisible"" older sister -- is quite touching.

The music is cheery and bouncy, and the colors and animation are beautiful. I mostly prefer older anime, because the new ones all pretty much look the same to me, but this show definitely stands out and I can't wait for Synch-Point to release the whole series.",1143676800,,711,4.780487804878049
7876891,1,630474532X,"Leave your fingers of this version. A very good movie, Chow-Yun Fat at its best. But you will only understand, if you know to talk chinese! The english subtitles have been cut of!",1127606400,2,179,4.454545454545454
7876892,4,630474532X,"i accidentally found copies of both 'god of gamblers' and 'god of gamblers' return' on DVD at my local record store. they are both distributed thru a company called mei ah entertainment, which put out 2 of jet li's films (hitman & my father is a hero). i took both DVD's home and put them in the player, and i was totally blown away. the transfers for both films are excellent, widescreen and the subtitles are a digitized white on the screen. you have the option of reading them in english and traditional or simplified chinese. the sound is also satisfactory. the DTS logo is on the packaging, so you have a choice between digital dolby 5.1 or digital dolby 2.0. there are 2 language tracks: chinese and mandarin. the best part, however, is that these DVD's can play in all region DVD players!

as for the films themselves...the popularity of the original 'god of gamblers' (1989) ignited a new genre in hong kong cinema of gambling films. suave gamblers of all ages and genders have been the protagonists of many films since the original, getting maximum mileage out of the exciting prospect of 'god-like' gambling abilities. even some not specifically 'gambling genre' films began including gambling scenes that echoed the cinematic exhilaration and tension inspired by 'god of gamblers'. the original's director, wong jing, did some success-surfing of his own with his 'god of gamblers II' and 'god of gamblers III back to shanghai' starring parody king stephen chiao...although either 'god of gamblers' or 'god of gamblers' return' may not break any new cinematic ground, it certainly does succeed in reaffirming chow yun fat's unparalleled appeal and success in the genre's terrain (HKFM).

if you could find the mei ah edition of these films, snatch them if you can. i must add they are a bit pricey ($25 each), but they are both worth it!",1122940800,3,1847,4.841772151898734
7876893,5,630474532X,"The first volume came out on my 21st birthday. After dealing with old VHS fan-subtitles for years, seeing this series come out on DVD was a dream come true for me. I can't say much about it that other people haven't already in their other reviews, other than this is easily one of my all-time favorite anime.",1120176000,,308,4.421052631578948
7876894,4,630474532X,"To be sure, I was pretty wary of Tenshi ni Narumon (abbreviated Tennimon for those in the know, and those who wish to save themselves from tongue-twisting) when my friend first mentioned it to me.  Here we have a the sugary-cute blonde Noelle, and I was quite certain I'd be annoyed with her withing the first ten minutes or so of her screen time.
Fortunately, though, I was completely wrong.  I found her to be cute, innocent, and completely free-spirited.  She's an excellent and endearing heroine that's by no means perfect.  The boy she loves is Yuusuke, a (startlingly) feminine-looking high schooler that's living on his own while his father is out of the country on business.
Sounds really simple, right?  Boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy joins girl's family in defeating a giant daruma/rice-cooker.  Oop, hold up there.  Good thing for the viewer that Tennimon doesn't seem to follow any strictly conventional formula.  While during some scenes you'll think to yourself, ""I know the gist of this"" and be correct, there's always some twist, some quirky charm that makes this series different.  Noelle's family simply must be seen to believe; each of them seem to have a fully-fleshed personality, instead of being used as mere static background characters.
The animation is beautiful, and yes, it's done with conventional cels!  The colors are so crisp and bright and, well, *shiny* that they would lead one to believe that Tennimon was animated digitally; but no, those are hand-painted cels you're looking at. The DVD's quality is top-notch, as well.  (It even includes things like translation notes, a real bonus for us purist buffs!)
If there is a flaw, it's that the show is a little *too* sugary.  A friend of mine once said that she could only stand so much Tennimon at a time; too much was prone to make her teeth ache.  If you can stand excessive cuteness, lots and lots of pink, and plenty of ""wai!""ing, (all of which are mostly from Noelle-chan) Tenshi ni Narumon is a good choice for you.",1059696000,,2010,4.808139534883721
