1566311,5,B00005JN8U,"With reality television, churn-out teenage soap-operas, and lazy sitcoms taking over the primetime programming schedule, people forget what a great show is. Because of this, great shows don't get watched and then producers and writers don't want to take the risk of doing something original since television demographics aren't quite intellegent enough to get it. Touching Evil had guts to put such an original and daring show on the airwaves run by ratings. Unfortunately, great shows don't always get rewarded.

Now cancelled after only a one season (a short mid-season show at that), the twelve episodes it had was filled to the fullest of quality, probably being the most original detective drama of its time. You know how someone says ""detective drama"" and you get that certain image in your head? Touching Evil is not that image. I shouldn't even be putting it in the genre. The show is also very visually intriguing, from hallucinations to schizo-fantasies, every episode is an eye-catcher. Not to mention being supported by beautiful, melodic yet trippy musical score by 12 Rounds' Atticus & Leo Ross.

The main character, Creegan, is lovable as the semi-sane detective adapting to every person he ever interrogates. Jeffrey Donovan plays it over-the-top, but in a good way. His energy reflects on the kinetics of the show and the unique storylines within each episodes. There is a few emotional arcs, and I was sad to see it go since I'm sure the second season would bring full story-arcs to plague our characters.

I can't find a good show that is currently starting this season, so I was heartbroken when I heard of Touching Evil's cancellation. Although, I'm sure it would have been picked up by another channel if producer Bruce Willis tried a little harder.

So our only hope to see this show again is the DVD. This show, now cancelled, needs to gain the cult status it respectfully deserves so it isn't forgotten. Even if you've never heard of this show, please sign up for the DVD so it gets released. You won't be sorry, trust me.",1097107200,32,2047,4.873563218390805
1566312,5,B00005JN8U,"This was a really wonderful show.  Unfortunately, it seems that all the good shows lately have been cancelled WELL BEFORE THEIR TIME.  Although only one season, I intend to buy this DVD as soon as it is released.  I highly reccomend this show to everyone out there.  The characters and stories were intriguing and fast-paced.  This is just good stuff all around.  What a shame.",1096675200,4,377,4.723076923076923
1566313,5,B00005JN8U,"This show is amazing and the main characters have similaraties to mulder and scully from the X-Files!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Release it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1094860800,4,148,6.7894736842105265
1566424,5,B00005JN8U,"This was one of the best series I have ever seen.  USA was quite dopey to not give this a chance and promote it more than it did.  It was dark, dramatic, with lots of quirky humor and great acting.  Years later and I still check back periodically to see if USA got smart and produced some DVDs...  Nope.",1249776000,,303,4.084745762711864
1566425,5,B00005JN8U,"How devastating that USA did not give this series a chance.  It was truly brilliant.
Touching Evil has stayed with me all of these years.  The writers pushed the viewers past
the usual pablum fed to the American public.  Maybe that's why this show failed.  It could be USA
Network did not trust the viewers elevated sense of what was atmospheric, at times complicated,
and sometimes heartbreakingly sad.

I appreciated that the episodes did not end happily.
Someone was keyed in to true art in Touching Evil.  Too bad the powers that be did not trust the process
and viewers to catch on.",1244851200,,587,4.650485436893204
1566426,5,B00005JN8U,"How long has it been since this show aired? Something in the ballpark of five years?! And yet, after all this time, and having only aired for one season, we (the viewers, the fans) are still writing about this show! The question I have is, if it was so inadequate to continue to a second season, then why do we still remember it fondly, and miss it? More importantly, since we still do keep it in our minds, and reminisce every now and again, the next question I have is why hasn't the production company: USA Network, done anything to appease us? Something I fail to understand is how Burn Notice got to be so popular, and Touching Evil did not. Granted, they are pretty different shows (what with plot lines, and character traits), but still. When Burn Notice first came out, I thought I'd give it a try because I remembered how much I loved watching Jeffery Donovan's character in Touching Evil. But I don't bother with it anymore. I couldn't even tell you when it's on television because it just doesn't interest me. I enjoyed Donovan's character in Touching Evil much more. And the show, in general, was just so much better. It seems to me that if people are still talking about and thinking about this show, that there is obviously a marketable audience, and I bet it would do really well with DVD sales.",1238716800,3,1310,4.508403361344538
1566427,5,B00005JN8U,"I didn't know about this show until I was checking out what Jeffrey Donovan has been in after seeing Burn notice. This totally looks like my kind of show and I want really badly to see it. I would pay for the DVD if USA would just release it. There seems to be an audience, people are talking about this show on the Burn Notice message boards and the general feeling is DVDs please!!",1234137600,,383,4.1891891891891895
1566428,5,B00005JN8U,"I remember when this show came out- I am pretty sure it was summer time. There were no other cable network shows out. My family would all vacation at the beach, where there was no tv- and I would pack my kids in the car in the evening and drive home at night- because I was taping it, and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. I have been waiting and hoping they put it out on dvd- there's no hope of ever bringing the series back, now that USA has a hit with Burn Notice. I am happy for them, and the show, but they were so stupid to cancel it. Now Cable television has figured out finally- put shows on while everyone else plays reruns! So put it out on dvd already!",1233187200,,669,3.962962962962963
1566429,5,B00005JN8U,I don't understand why they haven't put it out on DVD yet. I was telling my husband about it when we were watching Burn Notice. He missed it because he was out of the country the year it showed. I really hope they put this out for purchase. He missed a great show.,1215302400,,264,4.0
1566430,5,B00005JN8U,"That fact seemingly strikes me when I consider it. While Jeffrey Donovan has taken up a new show with USA (Burn Notice which I do enjoy) it's just not the same for me. I used to sit down every night Touching Evil  came on and become SOO engrossed with the show. I just don't understand why they haven't released the show. It's not like it was a crappy show that noone tuned in to watch. It was gripping and I can still remember the pilot and several of the first episodes (though it has begun to run together). I consider several TV show's to be my favorite (X-Files, Buffy, Law and Order:SVU, etc) but none of them have ever affected me the way this show did. So, I hope that this review is one more they can add to thier list and people PLEASE KEEP REVIEWING!!!",1213228800,3,763,4.226027397260274
1566431,5,B00005JN8U,"OK, so Jeffrey Donovan's got another new series on USA coming out, but it's going to be awfully hard to separate him from the memorable character he developed during this series' short run.  I can't believe it's not on DVD by now either.  Maybe USA will have some incentive to put ""Touching Evil-The Series"" out if Donovan's new show clicks.  Here's hoping.",1181347200,6,357,4.725806451612903
1566432,5,B00005JN8U,"Loved the show, and I really hope they distribute it on DVD",1159228800,5,59,4.0
1566433,5,B00005JN8U,"I have been shopping on Amazon for years, have bought hundreds of books and DVDs, and I have never written a review before. I won't get the series from file sharing...unless it never gets released by USA for purchase. I loved this show and would buy a copy for everyone I know. It may have been one of those shows that was ahead of its time for television when it ran in 2004. It is more than half way through 2006 and, if it were released now, it would probably be the greatest hit USA ever released.

We have already waited too long for the DVD. Please release it NOW. Fellow ""Touching Evil"" lovers: be sure to sign up to be notified when it is finally available. Every one of us who does makes it more possible that we will be able to see this fine show again.",1157241600,14,763,4.155405405405405
1566481,5,B00005JN8U,"How could USA be so stupid and cancel this show I was so hoping that the second season would come out. Then I heard that the show was canceled and that sure as hell pissed me off. Thank god tha they did not canceled THE 4400 or else they would be the second dumbest station that would canceled great TV shows. Number 1 will always be FOX (Firefly,Aressted Developement,etc..) Dude hurry up and come out with the DVD already I'm going nuts here.",1153440000,6,444,4.36144578313253
1566482,5,B00005JN8U,"I'm British, so I grew up with the original Touching Evil, with Robson Green, but this version, an American version, is superb.

You've done yourselves very proud guys and gals.

USA on the other hand, what the!! How could they cancel a brilliant, eary, touching show like this. It's something that stands out from the crowd, and I truelly hope that it's picked up by someone, somwhere to continue on.

I got given a taped version of the Pilot, as a favour, and I thought that the acting, plot and general 'thought' that had gone into it was above par with most of what I see nower days.

It's one of those shows like Joan of Arcadia that you know should have been given a longer lease on life. You can't truelly apreciate how much I want to see this show brought back.

I'm going to cross a few palms with silver to see if I can get some copys of the whole run, thus far, of this season.

Please PLEASE enter your email address to say that you want info on when this series will be released. It's the only thing that big companys understand.

Bring this show back, it's one in a million.",1146355200,15,1088,4.278048780487805
1566483,5,B00005JN8U,"I completely agree with everyones views.  I want this show back!  If anything, i want it on DVD so i can at least enjoy what little of it there was.  I made sure i was home every night to watch Touching Evil.  I really miss it :( ... I really hope/pray that they at least put it on DVD, i mean look at all the meaningless and stupid things they have put on DVD now.  Shows no one watched or liked, but people like this show and want it back.",1145664000,3,441,3.8555555555555556
1566484,5,B00005JN8U,"I agree with some of the people posting here, this series was too good to last so little, it scapes me how USA network can have crapy programs like JAG and Texas Ranger lasting more than a season, and a great show like this got cut out.

I really hope it comes out on DVD I would certainly buy it.",1127260800,5,297,3.95
1566485,5,B00005JN8U,Finally a tv series comes out that is incredibly awesome.  I agree - USA made a mistake and someone needs to pick this show up and give it another chance (preferably with the sames actors),1119398400,8,188,4.371428571428571
1566486,5,B00005JN8U,"Touching Evil on USA Network was such a wonderful, wonderful show.  Unfortunately, I, like many of the reviewers, found it late in the season.  And now I'm looking for my ""Touching Evil fix"", but I see it's not even available!  How do we get it to come back, and how do we get USA to release it on DVD?  I've emailed USA Networks already.",1119139200,8,338,4.234375
1566487,5,B00005JN8U,"I am still in shock!!How could USA network kill the only GREAT series it has ever had??Touching Evil was and still is the best character driven show. Creegan lives!

1566488,5,B00005JN8U,"How could USA be so STUPID?! Shows like this take time to GROW and develop. Touching Evil is an awesome show and it's probably the best serious crime drama I've seen since the beginnings of the X-Files.

If you liked the shows Millennium or the first half of the X-Files you'll love Touching Evil.

This show combines all the stuff lovers of true crime and serial killers want: action, drama, REALISM, an awesome soundtrack, good acting, and some really evil plots. CSI and the other crime shows are just too clean and too perfect. There's no really evil people or plots.

Where's Hannibal Lector when you need him?

Most of the episodes are available on the file sharing networks but I really hope USA will get SOME sense and release it on DVD.",1104278400,48,745,4.578947368421052
1566489,5,B00005JN8U,I do not understand how such a great show can get cancelled while the other networks load up with reality shows that stink. Reality shows are the worst thing to hit television since commericals. USA should reconsider Touching Evil.,1099872000,21,231,4.948717948717949
1566490,5,B00005JN8U,"I can't believe this show got cancelled!  Is USA nuts?  I didn't get into it until late in the game and there was such an underground buzz about this show during its run.  There are so many detective shows on (CSI has THREE versions!) but this show really stood out.  The X-files created a not-so-niche market for an off the center, intelligent, quirky, creepy, and even funny show that has yet to have its shoes filled in, and desperately needs to!  Touching Evil had all those elements and then some.  I've been waiting to buy the DVD so I could watch the episodes I missed in the beginning.  What a gip.  I'm SO disappointed.  This show NEEDS to come back on the air!  It was TOO GOOD to get cancelled!  UGH!  Sign up for the DVD title so we Touching Evilites at least get that!

The amount of positive reviews of a show that's been off the air this long and is NOT out on DVD should be enough to show USA they have an audience for this product.  I'm not sure why they've yet to begin making money off this amazing show, but now would be a great time to finally give in and get on it.  Burn Notice is off the air - I'm sure fans of Jeffrey Donovan who have yet to see this would be glad to buy it just to see him again.

Millennium, the TV series, Hannibal, the TV series, The Fall, the BBC TV series, all of these are an indication that there is an audience who has grown tired of Law and Order and CSI type crime dramas.  This show, Touching Evil, the American version was perhaps ahead of it's time, but it's time has come.  It's too late to believe it can be brought back on television with any hope of it's former flow and grace, but it can be released on DVD.  It can make money and serve as a small, critically and artisticallly appreciable, historical marker in the evolution of television.  Release it on DVD or for digital download at least.

7941725,5,B00005JN8U,"The people who hold the reigns on whether or not a tv series is released on DVD are treating us viewers as if we are puppets on a string.  If there is freedom of the press, then there should be freedom of the media.  Touching Evil was a 2004 tv series that disgracefully only lasted one season.  Isn't that bad enough?  Now viewers are being deprived of enjoying it on DVD and are kept dangling by the powers that be.  Why can't you understand that viewers want quality drama and are willing to endure years of deprivation without giving up the quest.  Shame on you!",1331251200,3,566,4.3428571428571425

7941727,5,B00005JN8U,I guess USA is re-thinking getting rid of Touching Evil since the success of Burn Notice.............Lucky for them Jeffery Donovan doesn't hold a grudge !,1316476800,2,155,5.24
7941728,5,B00005JN8U,"I keep checking to see if Touching Evil is out on DVD, and I keep being disappointed. If people are still talking about this show 7 years later, you'd think USA Network would see a marketing opportunity. Not only Touching Evil fans, but Burn Notice fans looking for more of Jeffrey Donovan's work would buy this DVD set.

Touching Evil is Donovan at his quirky best. Yeah, he's good in Burn Notice and I enjoy the show, but he really let his freak flag fly in Touching Evil. Donovan and Vera Farmiga have great chemistry, and the supporting cast includes Bradley Cooper, Kevin Durand and Pruitt Taylor-Vince.

7941729,5,B00005JN8U,"Jeffery Donovan gave a tour de force performance in perhaps one of the most intelligent, absorbing and enthralling detective shows ever on American TV. It was unconventional in that it fully fleshed out the main characters, embracing their flaws an failures as much as their heroic aspects. Pruitt Taylor Vince also turned in a riveting performance as a schizophrenic that Donovan's character ""adopts"" and looks after, recognizing his ""kinship"" to another damaged soul trying to cope with the world around him. The plots were well written, and Donovan inhabited his character so well that you could not look away. Twelve of TV's finest hours, and something surely worth being made available again to the large but unheard audience craving high quality entertainment. It is a crime that this isn't available on DVD.",1304467200,4,814,5.174242424242424
