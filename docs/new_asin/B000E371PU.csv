8104719,3,B000E371PU,"My big critique of ""Modern Marvels"" is that it speaks of lots of ancient stuff.  The pyramids and sugar are examples.  I appreciate that the narrator here began by asking, ""How can we speak of high tech for something that humans have done forever and seem to be pushed to do biologically?""

Viagra is brought up just six minutes into the program.  However, this work only taps on a question that many others have asked, ""If men have a blue pill, then why don't women?""  Instead it says more about, ""If women have a contraceptive pill, then why don't men?""

The ancient roots of these issues are discussed.  Ancient Egyptians had items that were forerunners to condoms.  Aristotle said olive oil was a spermicide and he was correct.  Like Penn & Teller's series on veracity, it debunks other things.  For example, Spanish fly may irritate the urinary system.

If you see the movie ""Kinsey,"" it emphasized that Kinsey did much to rid society of sexual repression.  Here, the Comstock Laws of the 1800s were mentioned twice.  It said WWI US vets weren't given condoms, so they came back home with all kinds of nasties.  Things were overridden by WWII.

I had no idea that Bob Dole was a test subject for Viagra, not just a randomly selected spokesman.  Some matters aren't touched which may be problematic.  The show has a heterosexist vibe, never once suggesting that sex could happen among just men or just women.  The work said the pill was first test in Puerto Rico.  Was this related to the rumored and horrid rampant sterilization of women on the island?!

This does touch on the future.  Can we get physical stimulation over the Internet?  Will porn expos introduce new gadgets for the masses?  Early in the program, it says that scientists may be able to replace the damaged genitalia of men and women.  (No mention of Mr. Bobbitt occurs, however.)",1324512000,,1853,4.700934579439252
