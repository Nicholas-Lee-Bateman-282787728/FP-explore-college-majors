8307505,5,B001GZZB2U,I ran across this show on late night cable channels and quite frankly fell in love with it.  Only a quick search and moments later this set was ordered and on its way.  My purchase arrived in the time specified and well packed to assure no damage was received in transit.  Very happy with my purchase and the DVDs still get plenty of use after a couple of years of ownership.  I would recommend the seller and would purchase again.,1371254400,,431,4.35

8307507,5,B001GZZB2U,"Very funny, quirky little ensemble show.  Personality driven and not just the usual sit-com drivel.  Memorable characters set in a small town on the prairie in Canada.

This merchant shipped promptly and everything was as promised.  Good experience.",1296345600,,249,5.473684210526316

8307509,5,B001GZZB2U,Love the show.  My husband is actually from the area which this show is shot.  We've got pictures of the Corner Gas set and the Dog River elevator.,1242950400,,147,4.214285714285714
8307510,5,B001GZZB2U,"Corner Gas is a TV classic in the truest sense, all without a laugh track, where you'll find yourself laughing aloud. Virtually every episode is a gem and, like Laurel & Hardy comedies, you'll laugh everytime you view a show. I suggested the series to writer Burt Prelutsky, who responded: ""I'm hooked, as are all my friends, and my lawyers will be contacting you!"" Enough said, it's simply one of the best TV series ever produced where the writing, superb cast and excellent production values have made it a true classic.",1242345600,,522,4.747252747252747

Once you watch this Canadian off-beat sitcom and get to know its cast of characters, you will want the DVDs so you can watch them again and again.  Each time you watch they are just as funny as the first time (if not more so -- as you may catch some of the best one-liners you missed the first time around).  My husband and I think of this series as Canada's ""Seinfeld.""  It's also one of the few TV series that EVERYONE can watch and enjoy together.",1237852800,,635,5.32
