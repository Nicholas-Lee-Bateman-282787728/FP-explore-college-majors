8316730,4,B001KZVQDO,"This was one segment of History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series originally aired on that cable channel. I am a fan of that series and this is one of the best segments.

The video gives a little background on M-B racing and sports car history before getting to the 300SL. It covers the SL well, showing the racing-inspired construction of the classic SL ""Gullwing"" and the powerplants that drove them down the road at 160 mph.

But, it's more than just the SL. The video shows how the M-B sports cars evolved into less of a racing, sports car and into a ""personal luxury grand tourer"" as the 300SL and 190SL roadster were phased out. You see the later versions of the M-B cars such as the 230, 250, 350 and on until you got to a car that had very little ""sport"" left from the original ""sports cars"".

But, the story didn't stop there. It also showed more recent Mercedes cars striving to reclaim some of that 300SL-type performance. So, the video shows how M-B began with a pure racer, moved to more of a luxury two-seater, then back again to more performance oriented cars.

The video also briefly touches on Mercedes-Benz construction, engineering and automobile safety research - long before any government required it. Very interesting sidelines to the main story.

I liked this video and was happy with the purchase. Minuses: it's only 47 minutes long and it's price is simply too high for that short a DVD. Not to worry, look at other Amazon sellers under the ""More Buying Options"" heading. There are Amazon sellers who offer this fine DVD at a much lower price. I recommend this video with four stars.",1295568000,2,1606,4.640845070422535
