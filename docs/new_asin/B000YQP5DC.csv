Some things were done out of order, which may confuse those who are sticklers for learning procedures step by step. It is a decent basics video. I don't know if i agree with some of the techniques or tools used but again it is a very basic intro to spa treatments.",1319673600,,389,4.492957746478873
8233863,3,B000YQP5DC,"I am not sure just what rubbed me wrong about this video. I got stuck on the instructors speech pattern, the camera angle missed important visual information many times, and I felt like the treatments were not first class. Many times I have seen Massage Nerd video's on you tube and thought they were interesting, but with this video I couldn't stop feeling annoyed? I hope they pull this one and refine it before they continue to offer to the public.",1284681600,,451,4.580246913580247
