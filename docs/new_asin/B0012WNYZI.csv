8248042,2,B0012WNYZI,"The plot...there is really none that would make much sense for adults, but a man that is a police man and a loser, has trouble with gambling, and it seems EVERYTHING, and rents himself out to wedding party on the boat to keep security and one of the guests is in love with the groom of the boat, and then blows it up..with only at 1st two survivors[the 3rd one shows up later for a menage'] and they land on a island i can presume that is deep in Malay waters. There is little nudity, and inane dialog and more Hong Kong silliness, that is a staple of such films of this ilk.... as it is filmed as ""live action"", and not such like other Hong Kong movies and films of this type..but i would not recommend it, as bad acting, not much of a plot, cheap[VERY] special effects[FX], and amateurish film making...makes this move a pass. Only for those that want to see a bad film and waste money... 2 stars is more then i should really give this movie, as i would wish to give more, as some of this genre Do deliver..but not this movie, So it may have curio value for someone that likes these types of decieving cover art films, promising of more..but you getting less to nothing but time you have wasted and could have done more constructive. Just rent or wait for it to go 3 dollars.. or less...I wished i had!;-(",1290470400,,1307,4.253012048192771
