3715950,5,B001NFNFM6,I cant believe I didn't really give this show a chance when they were first aired. This is a VERY VERY funny sitcom... the only annoying thing about the show is the oldest daughter's voice and acting. They made a good choice in replacing her after the seasoin was over. Not ashamed to say it only because she found other acting jobs after the show didn't renew her contract.,1355184000,,374,4.434782608695652

3715954,3,B001NFNFM6,"This season of My Wife and Kids is a lot of fun, but don't expecto to receive 22 episodes, there were only twelve episodes in this season, for this it receives just 3 stars.",1336003200,,173,4.117647058823529
3715955,5,B001NFNFM6,"We are a large family that consist of Husband, Wife and children.. More than in this show and we have so much fun! T.V. shows like this we collect for our family DVD collection. Our children LOVE this show so we had to add this to our DVD collection.

What we did not know is that there were only five seasons made and only two seasons have been released. So this season starts our DVD collection for this T.V. sitcom series.

With today's trash T.V. we just grew tired of paying for crap! We wanted to view T.V. the way we wanted and the shows we wanted to see that we thought had value and worth to them, this is one of those shows.

Today's T.V. is so bad to us that we cut paid for T.V. off and purchased Roku and Logi Tech Revue and view T.V. though Netflix. We did not find this show on Netflix show we purchased both seasons.

Many people are looking for real T.V. shows and this is one of them. This show is filled with great comedy, lessons, and morals. We are glad to have finally made this purchase as we have our wish list of sitcoms that we want. Since we don't have cable any more we take a portion from our savings and buy the shows we want from time to time. Over time we will have all the shows we want.

If you are looking for clean family entertainment for the whole family, this is one sitcom that will keep you going for hours! Give this sitcom a try and support sitcoms such as this so that more can be made and we can get T.V back to the way it should be.

Well once we receive our copies we will update their condition and the packaging. For now just know that this is one funny show and keeps our family laughing. This is good for family down time and you don't have to worry about children viewing things they should not.

Get your laugh on !",1335916800,,1768,4.077809798270893
3715966,5,B001NFNFM6,My Wife & Kids season 1 is so hilarious. and there 12 episodes on (2 DISC). i do not understand y it say (1 disc) but i think someone should fix that. but i think its a great buy and lots of non stop laughs! i give this season 5 star. *****,1297814400,,240,3.6346153846153846
3715967,5,B001NFNFM6,I love this show i been waiting for this to come out on dvd for the longest one of my favorite shows of all time my boy damon wayans who is my favorite out the wayans delivers a show full of laughs the supporting cast is great a must have for anyone,1258156800,,249,3.8076923076923075
3715968,5,B001NFNFM6,"There is a unique, great chemistry between Damon Wayans and Tisha Campbell-Martin that captivates me in each of these shows.  It is hard to believe they are not a real, functioning family.  The shows address pertinent issues in family units and deliver unique attempts to solve family problems.  As a psychology enthusiast, I love this show for the message that is exhibited: communication is key!  Along with addressing principles and issues, the show also offers an excellent, comedic quality.  I would recommend the show for anyone who is a fan of sitcoms, especially comedy!",1255824000,3,578,5.1063829787234045
3715969,5,B001NFNFM6,"This series is the way tv should be. The Wayans Bros. mix real life situations with positive messages in an, ""in your face, have you lost your mind, did he REALLY say that?!"" kind of way. If your need to laugh and you need it to make sense, this is one show you will definitely want to pick up!",1243382400,,294,4.0
3715970,5,B001NFNFM6,"My Wife & Kids season 1 is hilarious all 12 episodes Michael, Jay, Juinor, Claire and Kady will have you laughing non-stop. This season features the original Claire who was sort of mean and sassy and wore a little too much eye make-up, I like the present Clair better. Anywho, I hope they release the rest of the seasons on dvd because the show has become a cult classic.

3715971,1,B001NFNFM6,This show is an affront to decent family values and yet another mockery of African-American families.  I struggle to understand why anyone feels the need to support the Wayans clan in yet another dud!,1241481600,5,200,4.882352941176471

At least I don;t think I did.  Well I have seen it lately but not when it was new.  It is SO funny.  The actors are all great.  It has good stories.
