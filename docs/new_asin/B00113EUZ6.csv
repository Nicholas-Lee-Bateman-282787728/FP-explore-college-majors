8240073,2,B00113EUZ6,"This DVD cost a lot of money, and it is primarily just concerned with two things. The first is equipment coming ashore, the second is the aftermath of the bombing. There is no sound track at all. It was only worth the money to me because I participated in that episode and had some connection to the things I saw in the video. There's almost nothing out there on the Beirut disaster, just a handful of books and I have them all. So, I paid the money for it because of the association, more than for any real information it gave me.",1350604800,2,531,4.215686274509804
