Volume 4 wraps up the series with the last 2 discs. The final 3 episodes I can only describe as epic. Huge space battles and a morphing battleship in space, intentions are revealed, and the only hope for the universe are Eclair and Lumiere, two superpowered kids. Lumiere, who can control most electric or computerized devices, and Eclair with her wicked lipstick and hyperspeed, they bring the fun to the show.

So if you are thinking of getting this, do it, its worth it.",1254873600,3,714,4.401515151515151
