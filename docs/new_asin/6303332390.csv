The movie has been forgotten or hung up for whatever reason and it's a damn shame. The acting is superior all around. John Glover plays one of the best weird, cleverly evil criminals of filmdom. Yes I'd go that far. The movie has a mixture of many elements. One element captures perfectly the decadent street sex of the eighties. Also mixed in between Roy Scheiders affluent fish out of water charactor are drugs, kidnapping, revenge, love, lust, redemption and betrayal. Also added to the boiling pot are an unusual assembly of actors. Some are the epitome of the eighties. Others are old screen stars, decent tv actors, then unknown names, great charactor actors and even a ""cameo"" by a renowned porn ""star"". This caldron, well paced and plotted really nails it. Some may say I'm overratting it, and maybe I am a bit, but hey, I'm the reviewer. 52 Pickup is well done, particually now in a nostalgic way. Forget the VHS tape(even laserdisc). DVD only. Hang in there sport. [UPDATE 6/9/07: Im sure Roy Schieder does know what happening with this film. I have a multi region dvd player and have finally seen this classic on dvd. It can be purchased through Amazon as a region 2 disc. Several web sites have also pointed out that it will be released in the good old USA this summer. The region 2 disc picture and audio are just ok. Im hoping the region 1 release will be much improved with seriously needed extras. ""She still cooks."" ]",1128643200,10,1576,4.592198581560283

 This movie features a trio of of bad guys that is unsurpassed.  Roy Scheider finds himself meeting them face to ski mask after a brief affair with stripper ""Cindy"" played by a young Kelly Preston.  Cindy worked at a strip club with Prince protege Vanity, as Doreen.  Doreen just happens to be dating Bobby, part of the trio.  Bobby is brought to low-life by a thoroughly demented Clarence Williams the Third (Mod Squad).  There is a great scene where Bobby comes into Doreens apartment while she's asleep.  Bobby thinks Doreen gave Scheider the info to find out who and where they are.  To insure she's telling the truth when she says she never told him, he almost suffocates her with her own giant teddy bear.  Then hilariously, after she is completely terrified, and he satisfied she's been truthful, he tells her to ""get some rest."" Sure!

There is also the pathetic Leo, third man in the trio, but he's more like Alan and Bobby's gofer.  He's weak, and folds easily under pressure.>Meanwhile, Scheider's affair ends up video-taped by the trio while in a hotel with Cindy, and the trio then gets a hold of him to show him a video tape where they use his stolen gun to shoot and murder her.  From there, the trio tries to extort money from Scheider, but all he and politcal wife Ann-Margret can afford is $52,000...hence the title.

This movie has a great feel, pacing, and really keeps you interested throughout.  John Glover as Alan Raimy, leader of the gang, and porn king who runs an X-rated movie theatre, is highly amusing. He enjoys video-taping homemade porno movies, and calling Scheider ""Sport.""  He thinks he's got Scheider just where he wants him, but finds out soon enough, his is a losers game.

This is a great John Frankenheimer masterpiece, and like many great films, will end up missed by most.  If you've read this review though, maybe I've convinced you to check it out.  You'll be riveted beginning to end, guaranteed.",1005436800,34,2084,4.754874651810585
