When I got it for Christmas that year I almost did a backflip (no joke)!  I had to get an extra copy because the VHS I have is 17 years old lol and well worn out!!  Been eaten a few times by VCRs.  I haven't watched this copy that I purchased and don't plan to, I just like to have it in my collection.  Some day I'll get married to a symphony playing ""November Rain"" LOL",1342569600,,520,3.7777777777777777
7831860,4,6302804612,"Although the video clip itself is good, I liked this video least of the three ""Making Videos"" videos. Why? In it you get to listen to what Del James has to say (the man behind the short story ""without you"" at the end of the clip). I just thought he had a rather conceited personality, which spoiled it a bit for me. It's like he wanted to take all the credit for this song and some other songs.
I like the part where Slash goes outside and literally plays up a storm, well, sort of a dust storm! I thought it was cool that GNR actually played live in front of the audience for the last half of the video. I didn't think it was for real.
I think it is this video that they play the demo version of November Rain at the end - something which you might not have heard. I can't be absolutely certain, because I watched all three videos in succession, and now they've kind of all melded into one. Also on that note, I like the fact that a separate film crew were needed to film the people who were being filmed in the video. Hope that makes sense! They were a little cheeky. Anyway, that english guy (I don't know his name but I think he was in charge of making the three video clips) makes up for Del James. Dizzy Reed is also cool.",1023321600,3,1228,4.078512396694215
7831861,3,6302804612,"Just like part I (Don't Cry), part II shows the behind the scenes making of one of the best GNR songs of all time - November Rain.  A better understanding of one of GNR's most complicated and successful songs can be  obtained by watching this terrific video.  The documentary crew - who  filmed most of the video - did a marvelous. job if you're a true fan and want a good insight into  how GNR work, think and play, get this video.",929923200,11,432,4.219512195121951
