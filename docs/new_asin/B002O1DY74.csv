Enjoyable as a visual version of Kafka's novel and for lovers of the absurd and surreal.",1424044800,8,283,4.1454545454545455
3960709,3,B002O1DY74,"It's been awhile since I've seen an episode of this show.  I don't quite understand why it only had one season, UNLESS it's what morphed into ""The First 48.""  In this episode, an apartment is burnt and has a dead body in it.  These ""Forensic File""-type shows always emphasize that arson does not get rid of all evidence.  They could use footprints to find the killer.  Shockingly, plenty of items in the apartment looked untouched; perhaps manufacturers are really making long-lasting products.  This episode just peels away at a suspect's lies to get proof of the misdeed.  I liked seeing a heavyset sistagurl who had it goin' on so well that she had more than one boyfriend.  (No singing ""Me, Myself, and I"" for her!)  If you like to learn a new word per day, then ""avuncilicide"" (sp?) means the murder of an uncle (similar in style to fratricide or regicide).",1386979200,,862,4.655629139072848
3960710,5,B002O1DY74,"A piece of art by Orson Welles who managed to make  the nightmarish Kafka's reality come so close that it gives you creeps--the mazelike world where there is no social justice, spiritual security,logic or common sence but only anxity, loneliness, frustration and endless invisible walls that make you claustraphobic. The main character is convicted, accused,and sentensed to death. He has comitted no crime but since he is flesh and blood of the bloody system he feels guilty and the whole system seems to operare through the man's innate sence of guilt. Thus he can never learn the nature of his guilt and is defeated in his futile struggle to beat the system or at least find the mysterious court, judges and best advocates. This remoteness from the highest legal authority hurts Joseff K.,since he is sort of a currupted official himself. Most brilliant performance by Anthony Perkins who had always been the outstanding outsider underaprisciated by blind Holliwood. The one from the former USSR (like me) should watch the film.",996105600,6,1031,5.064705882352941
3960711,5,B002O1DY74,"""Say what you like, but THE TRIAL is the best film I ever made!""  So says Orson Welles of his 1962, underrated masterpiece THE TRIAL, taken from Franz Kafka's legendary novel of the same name, the story concerns Josef K, (Anthony Perkins in a world class performance) a bank clerk arrested and put on trial for an unspecified crime.  The liquid tracking shots and receding perspectives familiar from TOUCH OF EVIL are refined here and more at home with the narrative of THE TRIAL.  Welles' editing is also more distinctive and expressive, as K's world begins to reel faster and faster out of control, the editing itself transforms from the long takes in the beginning to more frenzic cutting giving certain scenes an oddly affecting flow.  The exteriors are notably different from scene to scene, some Italian, some Yugoslavian, some Parisian, but all effective and creepily disorienting.  The casting is also a plus:  Romy Schneider as a seducing nurse who jumps on Josef t! he first chance she gets, Jeanne Moreau as a world-weary nighclub stripper with whom Josef is smitten, Orson himself as The Advocate, Akim Tamiroff as his client/slave, and Perkins, in a bit of casting that many people didn't understand, is truly a marvel and a revelation.  With every facial expression and movement of his body he paints a portrait of man who on the surface strikes a cutting, heroic stance, but in private is really like all other people in his impatience with uncomfortable circumstances.  He avoids the tempting opportunity to provide sympathy to K, as his plight grows more chaotic, his demeanor becomes more testy, and that's as it should be.  Critics apparently wanted a nullingly straight rendition from the novel, but Welles, Perkins and the rest of the crew thankfully didn't oblige them.  They find the perfect balance between a daring cinematic adaptation without sacrificing the spirit of the novel.  While it's not his best, this is better than alot of Welles'!  films, .  1.
