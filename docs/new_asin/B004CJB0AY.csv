4327591,5,B004CJB0AY,"What's more to say?
The original (directors cut) movie is classic and awesome, the second movie is trash and only watchable because of the blonde chick who looks like a porn star.  If you don't like the first movie you have no right to call yourself an American or European.",1354320000,,274,4.48
4327592,2,B004CJB0AY,"Loved the highlanders movies and tv show,ever since they came out.first movie was awsome but the second was such a waste and confussing movie that made no sense.but after watching the second highlander on bluray I saw they really changed alot in the movie so it made more sense.still isn't as good as the first tho. Now with the pictures on both I dunno what to even say.the grain in the picture is so bad at times.it. looks like im watchingbit on a old tv with a vhs tape.for such a game changer of a movie you would think that the transfer would of been alot better",1336262400,7,567,4.308411214953271
4327593,5,B004CJB0AY,"Una super edicion de esta pelicula de culto para fanaticos como yo, lo unico que le falto a la primera es que tenga el video con Queen... pero asi es la vida. Muy recomendable",1304467200,2,175,4.176470588235294
4327594,3,B004CJB0AY,"Was really excited to see these movies on blu-ray, couldn't wait to get them. They did a pretty good job on the transfer, the problem is that it was poor quality ro start with. The sound effects are just terrible, to me the video is way better than the original and the second disk is in 7.1 and sounds better than the first, but the second movie is dumber than I remember. All in all the first movie is hands down the best of the series, picture quality is pretty good considering. As always it was a pleasure doing buisness with Amazon.",1300924800,4,538,4.284313725490196
4327595,5,B004CJB0AY,Two movies for the price of one....what could be better.  How about two blu-ray movies for the price of one.  That is the great deal with these two movies.  Great movies and is amazing on HD.  I can hardly wait for the other Highlander movies to goto blu-ray.,1300233600,,259,4.333333333333333
4327596,1,B004CJB0AY,"I love the first movie,  and the second one is fun to watch just for the badness. It was specified nowhere on this page that I was getting the Renegade Version of Highlander 2 though, so I am sending it back for a refund.
EDIT:They changed the description because of my complaint.",1299715200,2,280,4.384615384615385

8423109,2,B004CJB0AY,"Although I know this is an older film, after seeing what others are able to do with refinishing films (Star Wars for example) with better sound or cleaning up the picture for Blu-Ray Hi-Def, I expected more from this particular film when re-released. The original is rather haggard in appearance on my DVD and the sound is really bad in specific scenes, the Blu-Ray version does little if nothing to correct obvious problems in either film on this collection. Keep in mind this film was low budget, poorly filmed and even poorer sound quality except for the superb soundtrack by Queen. Very pricey considering I think it's a direct knock-off of the DVD. Scenes from the female leads apartment sound like they were recorded on a handheld cassette recorder, scenes from the parking garage in the beginning sound like overloaded microphones poorly placed. The rest of the first film is more of the same basically. This Collection clearly needed work and got sorely neglected. Sorry I bought this and this is the first Blu-Ray I've said this on. This of course shows no reflection on vendor which was excellent.",1403654400,,1107,4.862433862433862
8423110,2,B004CJB0AY,"Highlander is a great fantasy-action film although the sequels have been widely mocked (only Highlander: Director's Cut and Highlander 2 are included). This 2-disc release does not include Highlander 3, 4 (Endgame), 5 (The Source) or the TV show. I'm not sure what happened to this franchise because only the original is worth owning. All five films bombed at the box office (that must have set some kind of record) although The Source only got a limited run in some countries and aired on TV in the US. Highlander 2 had the highest budget and the highest domestic gross in the franchise although many fans consider it the worst (some feel The Source is worse).

Overall, the picture quality is average at best (Highlander 2 is particularly poor) but the audio isn't bad. Some of the bonus features for both movies have been ported over from previous releases (Highlander gets a paltry 6 minutes and an audio commentary). There is a total of roughly 2 hours of supplements which is light for an anniversary collection. The original theatrical release of Highlander 2 isn't included. The original Highlander is a 5 star film but this is a 2 star package. It is fairly pricey at $65 for only two films since they can both be purchased separately for $26 total.

Special Features:
Highlander: * Deleted Scenes, * Audio Commentary with Director Russell Mulcahy
Highlander 2: * ""Highlander 2:: Seduced by Argentina"" Documentaries, * ""The Redemption of Highlander 2:"", * ""The Music of Highlander 2:"", * ""The Fabric of Highlander 2:"", * ""Shadow & Darkness: The Cinematography of Highlander 2:"", * Original Cannes Film Festival Promotional Reel, * Deleted Scenes, * Original Theatrical Trailer",1378857600,2,1685,4.971631205673759

Nothing bad to say about it. All good here.",1368748800,,101,3.857142857142857
8423112,4,B004CJB0AY,I will start by saying that I had never seen either of the highlander movies before ordering this. The first film is awesome and I was a little let down by the second. Either way for the price this is a nice two pack to add to your collection.,1368662400,,243,3.979591836734694
8423113,5,B004CJB0AY,"What a great purchase opportunity for any movie buff. The viewing quality of the blu ray film is excellent. The packaging proves it is of 100% new manufacture. The price of the product was very fair and I am more than satisfied.
I can highly recommend this suppliers work.

Thank you",1365811200,,283,4.549019607843137
