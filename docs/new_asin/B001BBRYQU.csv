8282585,5,B001BBRYQU,"As I am writing this review the statuette, which I could swear was glowing and moving during the film, is a metre nearer to me than where I originally put it. The thing here is you must watch the subtitled version. One main character comes over as quite strong in it, whereas in the dubbed version he is like an ott f****t which considerably undermines the whole film. A rich family in Europe seem to be haunted by a wife who recently died at childbirth, and one of their number starts hiring expensive prostitutes for home s&m sessions and apparently killing them. He's obviously on something because he keeps following diaphonously clad Evelyn around the castle grounds at night. Then there are more murders. Visually there is the sort of feel here of periodic time warps into Victoriana and it all seems quite original. Sometimes bloody, and very definitely a Giallo. In addition there is RED QUEEN, a very good murder mystery also from Emiglio Miraglia, with Sybil Danning in a memorable scene and also featuring Barbara Bouchet(Black Belly Of The Tarantula, Don't Torture A Duckling). As well as the statuette you also get an informative booklet and collectible enclosures. NoShame.",1382572800,,1187,4.91044776119403
8282586,5,B001BBRYQU,"I have been a Horror/Giallo Fan for many years now and have seen these 2 films on various VHS reproductions. Back in the day, pre-record of these 2 movies were very hard to find - so one had to put up with transfers from ""Original"" sources with mixed results.

Now - I didn't go for the package with the Doll - but was able to get the movies with the extra goodies. There is a wonderful booklet that comes with - all sorts of bio notes on some of the noteworthy actors. Plus there are some interviews with some of the actors and production people on the disc extras.

To be fair - I have to say that I love both movies equally - no favorites here. Evelyn is a wonderful Gothic movie that has plenty of 70's Fashion and Euro Scene for good measure. The atmosphere is dark with oppressive thunder & lightning, whips and chains and old castle shots. Red Queen takes place mostly in the day - lots of light in this one. Although most of the murders do take place at night for that added atmosphere. Like Evelyn - there is alot of Fashion and Euro Scene in Red Queen since two of the leads work for a Clothing Design House. But don't be deceived by all the day light in Red Queen - when she kills she emits a hysterical laugh that is absolutely chilling.

The camera work in both films is wonderful and it really come through in the presentation of Evelyn & Red Queen. The transfer is absolutely breathtaking in clarity - I don't see how there could be any improvement. For lovers of Euro Giallo/Horror Films during the 70's this one comes highly recommended.",1328745600,,1554,4.315068493150685
