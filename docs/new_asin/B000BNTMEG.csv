2430581,4,B000BNTMEG,"This was an intelligent, well-done story about the Watts' riots in Los Angeles back in 1965. It doesn't pander; it tells it as it was in a mature (and family-safe) manner. It sports a nice cast, too, with Cicely Tyson, Blair Underwood, James Earl Jones and Sally Kirkland.

Language-wise, this is a surprisingly clean movie. Even more of a shock is to see a good Christian woman in the lead (Tyson as ""Ruthana Richardson"")  Blair and Underwood play likable characters as well.

This is a good movie the whole family could enjoy. However, it's not one you're likely to watch many times. It's just not that riveting, but certainly deserves more attention that it's getting here with just over  a handful of reviews. It's very much worth seeing and discussing.",1235088000,,757,4.8
2430582,5,B000BNTMEG,"STORY - The film, based on a true story, begins with a scene from the Watts riot with two cousins (Bob Richardson & J.T. Turpin) arguing over whether to throw a molotov cocktail. It then flashes back to show how they and their family arrived at that point. How did a routine traffic stop flare into one of the worst riots in our history? How did the flames of racial prejudice get so hot? Richardson (Underwood) moved, along with cousin J.T. Turpin and their family, from Alabama to LA. It was supposed to be the land of opportunity but for the Turpins it becomes another racial ghetto and they end up in dead end jobs and alcohol. Richardson goes on to college and a tour of duty in the military. He returns and gets an entry level job as a messenger with the LA Times. He has finally entered into the lowest level of a white dominated profession and has ambitions of advancing. When the riots continue, the white reporters don't dare return to the scene and Richardson volunteers. A very realistic and sobering look at the racial situation in our country during that time (today?). There are several hopeful relationships such as the one Richardson formed with a young white police officer and with Junius Johnson (Jones), both of whom tried in their own way for reconciliation among blacks and whites. Those were voices ignored by both sides for the most part. An overlooked and underrated film. Still relevant and important today. Very well done. [...]",1209168000,4,1456,4.669260700389105
2430583,5,B000BNTMEG,"This is truly an amazing movie about the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965.  It focuses on Bob Richardson, the LA Times messenger who phoned in reports from the riot scene as they happened.  But it also tells the story of the people who got swept up in the violence and hate and of the innocent bystanders who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  A very accurate portrayal with amazing performances.",1117670400,9,407,4.4

8089559,3,B000BNTMEG,"I like Blair Underwood.  I think I saw this on t.v. some time ago, but I wasn't sure.  It was a typical race war type picture, but done from a different angle.  I like the fact that there was positivity in Blair becoming a great reporter amidst all of the chaos.  It takes a special kind of actor to bring that out.  The cast was good.",1457654400,,335,4.015151515151516

8089567,5,B000BNTMEG,I have not seen this movie in quite a number of years.  I was glad to see that it was a very good project for the writer and director of this movie based on the life of a LA Times African American messenger who was given the opportunity to become it first field reporter during the 1965 Watts riots.  The reason I purched the movie is entirely personal.  I appeared as an extra in two of the scenes in the movie.  My first appearence is walking down the sidewalk in the scene where Margeret Avery and her movie husband are pulled over by the police and the contents of her purse are dumped out.  The second scene is with Blair Underwood when he is at the carwash talking to his movie brother.  Cicely Tyson and James Earl Jones are also in the movie.,1362614400,2,750,4.20979020979021
