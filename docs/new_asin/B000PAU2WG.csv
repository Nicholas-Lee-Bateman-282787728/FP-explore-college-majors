Mark helps you to understand what you are drinking (the nuances of the wine) and encourages you to think about your experience (what does it taste like, what does it smell like, what is the color, is it sweet or dry or somewhere in-between..).  Invite him in to your living room with this DVD.

Mr. Phillips is not interested in any sort of pretentious airs about the subject.  In fact, he's trying to dispel them.  He's funny, charming and knows what he's talking about.  The time you use watching this DVD will be well spent.  His engaging manner will leave you wanting more knowledge on the subject which can be had in the CD set that explores the topic with considerable more depth.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It will give anyone a great base knowledge to enjoy wine.",1192406400,,598,4.481481481481482

We've passed on some his tips to friends and they are impressed with our wine knowledge!!",1192406400,4,614,6.426829268292683
8190183,5,B000PAU2WG,"This is an entertaining and informative DVD of the PBS TV show. Mark Phillips tells you things you didn't even think about regarding wine, and does it with humor and an everyman approach. The information on the storage of wine and tips on serving temperatures was very interesting to me, and I thought his assessment of the ""ratings"" you often see attached to various wines in liquor stores was spot on. His goal is to help you ""taste"" wine, instead of just drinking it, and to let you know that what *you like* is more important than anything else. A wonderful primer for the average wine drinker who has even the slightest curiosity about the art & craft of wine. It also would make a great gift, even as a host/hostess gift instead of the usual bottle.
I did have to order this DVD twice because the first shipment was incorrect as the first seller sent audio disks, not the TV show. I got a very quick credit and made sure I ordered from a different seller the second time.",1502064000,,977,4.433333333333334

The is easily the most readable book on wine you could find, and might even spark the interest of someone who things wine is not their thing.",1275264000,2,389,4.342465753424658
