8405391,4,B001C4ZQ7U,"This movie was remarkably realistic in showing what is truly going on today. For a film produced in 2007 it is still relevant today. It is indicative of what many of our teenage children encounter in school and quite often in their neighborhood..
I was a little miffed that Eric Watkins, (my nephew) who played a prominent role as the young black drug dealer, did not have his name featured in the list of characters.  I was pleased when I noticed that the beginning credits did display his name.
I enjoyed Love, Blood, & Kryptonite because the theme, plot, and acting was a true portrayal of the depths one may sink to provide for their loved ones.  Hopefully, this movie will bring home the point to young people, that selling, buying, and using drugs is the worst decision they can make in their life, no matter what the circumstances are.",1373155200,,842,4.6066666666666665
8405392,4,B001C4ZQ7U,"This movie is very gritty!  Its realism reminds me of the city Baltimore and is also scary and sad that our todays children have very little compassion for life, but then again, when our kids are on drugs, no wonder they can't seem to think or feel straight.  The movie itself does a good job on portraying life as it is today growing up in this... uncertain world of crime running rampant.",1247011200,2,390,4.402777777777778
8405393,4,B001C4ZQ7U,"This film is great considering the filmmakers were 18 when they made it. It is a showcase of young talent that is sure to go somewhere, and story is a unique take on the youth drama. Worth your while to watch for sure. it was created for its demographic by filmmakers living the events they are dramatizing.",1216944000,2,307,4.4035087719298245
