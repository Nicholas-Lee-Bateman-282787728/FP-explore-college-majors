2931583,5,B000V6WUWE,"Johnny has such screen presence, all he has to do is appear on screen.  Like another poster said, Johnny has ""It"".  The unexpalined aura of awe!  The film was very entertaining.  Any film that Johnny appears in is worth 5 stars!  Fabrice Luchini was excellent as the frenetic fan of Johnny.  I have to say that what totally caps this film is Johnny's fantastic, resonant, baritone voice.  It is unmatchable, except possibly by some opera singer, somewhere.  But Johnny is a rock star and his voice is the theme.  What excellence!",1397260800,,529,4.725274725274725
2931584,5,B000V6WUWE,The theme of this movie is about the power we all have to choose the life we want. Anything is possible.,1395273600,,104,4.0
2931585,5,B000V6WUWE,"Excellent film and very inspiring.  I am usually a tough critic with movies, and this film is a must watch!  If you don't mind subtitles, then I'd highly recommend.  I was so into watching this that I almost forgot it was in French. This is up there with any of the better American films.  Big applause to the director. Magnificent.",1383696000,,332,4.483333333333333
2931586,5,B000V6WUWE,"The thing that makes this movie is that Johnny Hallyaday plays himself. What if something happened and Johnny Hallyaday never became ""the French Elvis"".? What if he had never became a star, never continued in show business. Several of these general type ""going back in time"" movies have been made, a couple involving Elvis Presley. But, Elvis never played himself. It was always some actor playing a 1954 or 1955 Elvis. Johnny Hallyaday can dominate a movie without seeming to try. Check out ""A Man on a Train."" When you have that ""it"" thing, you've got it. You can't learn it. A well-written script (if you accept the premise.) Fabrice, of course is great, the rest of the cast that plays the bemused and long suffering families are outstanding.",1383004800,,746,4.790697674418604
2931587,4,B000V6WUWE,"I've enjoyed watching several good French films like ""Potiche"" over the past few of months, and I've seen Fabrice here and there in romantic comedies. I have mixed feelings about him and I can see why some people don't particularly like him. But I was surprised at the light, fun, comedy this turned out to be. Omigosh, I wasn't really paying attention to the names so much and I feel like an idiot that it wasn't until the end that I saw that the main two actors were characters named after themselves and I realized there was a real rock star named Johnny Hallyday/Jean-Philippe -- and I can definitely see & hear why he is compared to Elvis. And the montage of concert clips in the beginning are real!  I love it!  (Except they could have done a much better job aging Fabrice-- they didn't even try to give him a wig or a beard, etc.)

This movie was so much fun, and they did it keeping all their clothes on etc!  Enjoyable to watch and I'm sure they had fun making it. I thought the ending was great.

I know there are all sorts of cameos and inside jokes in this film that I don't get because I don't know French/European pop culture. So dang, it would be very funny to watch this again with that knowledge. I'm sure a Johnny Hallyday fans would know ""that was the outfit he wore on the cover of his '72 album"" or whatever, be laughing hard at the motorcycle toy models, Johnny saying he didn't like wearing leather & complaining about the Cuban heel shoes, etc. (Could someone please list them for us here or at IMDB?)  I did piece together the reference Fabrice makes about ""I know why you named [your bowling alley] that"", meaning The Olympia was a major concert venue Johnny Hallyday played. I noticed in the credits that the record producer Camus played himself. Also, the character 'Caroline' (Johnny's wife) was played by an actress named Caroline... who is she in relationship to the other people in real life?  At this point I'm sort of babbling, I guess. Sorry.

So while writing this, I wonder what would have happened if Elvis didn't become famous. Would he still be alive? Who would have replaced him?  I think it is terrific that Johnny Hallyday is not only alive and performing musically, but now acting as well. Elvis was a good son and a nice guy.",1381363200,,2270,4.450602409638554
2931588,5,B000V6WUWE,"These French do great films with improbable plots. It is a fantasy about an individual(Fabrice Luchini), who is  an all out fan of Johnny Halliday , a very famous French rockandroller  from the 60's who incidentally is still giving concerts nowadays . Alternative universes come into play and I''ll say no more . You have to see it. Fabrice Luchini is a great deal of fun to wartch. Johnny Halliday is a real person, very little known in the U.S. but very famous in France and he is still around. Film is a darling fantasy unless you believe in alternative universes which then makes it probable. See it.",1375056000,,604,4.583333333333333
2931589,5,B000V6WUWE,I loved this movie. It is fun and clean and clever. The premice is valid. I think you enjoy it much better if you have the cultural knowledge of who Johnny Hallyday is as well as how great an actor Fabrice Luchini is. As a French teacher I use it in my advanced class as the students are familiar with Johnny by the 4th year.,1310515200,2,325,4.015384615384615

Johnny Halladay is the French equivalent of Elvis.  Just say ""Johnny"" in France or Belgium and everyone immediately knows you are speaking of Johnny Halladay.  This film is based on the premise that ""Johnny"" missed his big break and the ensuing chaos for his No. 1 fan (played by Fabrice Lucchini).  Johnny, of course, plays himself.  This film gives you the opportunity to hear (and appreciate more than ever) the beauty of Johnny's voice as he sings in several scenes without all the overpowering music.  After seeing this film, you will walk with a bounce because Fabrice's natural and real ""joie de vivre"" comes across stronger than ever in this film, and it is contagious.  Enjoy!!

2931591,4,B000V6WUWE,"I stumbled on this film by flipping channels on the satellite service. I'm American but I recognized the two actors from ""Crime Spree"" and ""Intimate Strangers"" respectively. The basic story is about a clerical worker who gets conked on the head and enters an alternative universe where rock star Hallyday is an everyday fellow who used to play music. (Jean-Phillipe Smet is Hallyday's birth name.)  In reality  Hallyday is a huge  huge star in France and Belgium. I saw several articles labeling him equivalent to Elvis. The film is a lot of fun following Luchini as an obsessed fan deciding to be Hallyday s manager and restore his career. Much music  some slapstick action and a good chemistry between the leads and their confused significant others family co-workers  etc. This is definitely worth checking out.  (I see it isn t currently available at Amazon.)",1196294400,4,863,4.958333333333333
8216966,5,B000V6WUWE,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story. I suggest you listen to a few Johnny Halliday tunes before you watch the movie. Johnny Halliday is the most famous infamous rockstar in the world. Everyone knows him in french speaking countries as he is a living musical legend in France, not so much in the US. A fantastic fan movie. I love his music, not all of it but some tunes are really exceptional when you dig through his career (like 'Oh jolie Sarah' for example). Fabrice and Johnny both accomplish a beautiful hommage to all the talented artists that live their lives unnoticed (like Van Gogh) and never get the recognition they deserve.",1471737600,,696,4.666666666666667

8216972,5,B000V6WUWE,"One of my absolute favorites, Fabrice Lucchini is very funny and this shows a side of Johnny Halliday that is charming... although perhaps you need to know who Johnny is to realize the effect his absence could have on a diehard fan.",1422662400,,232,4.5476190476190474

8216974,3,B000V6WUWE,"It's pretty much a vehicle for Luchini to show off and have fun. Johnny Halliday looks like Charles Bukowski but his singing left me completely cold, despite lavish over-production of the big climax. Along the way some interesting glimpses of the suburban or small town life of the well off.",1401667200,,291,4.84
8216975,2,B000V6WUWE,"It's French, which I like, but that's about it. Main character well acted, but for the rest nothing really memorable, or it would be to see Johnny Halliday in his later years, still singing very decent.",1400198400,,202,4.638888888888889
