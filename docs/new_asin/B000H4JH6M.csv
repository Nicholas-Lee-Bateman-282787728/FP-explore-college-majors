They just loved it whenever the Pumpkin would stop to dance and the scene when they go to the Pumpkin Ball and show all the different dances pumpkins can do is great!  The DVD presentation is superb.  The full-screen image is crisp and clear, and the computer animation is beautiful.  It is not ""feature film"" quality animation, but the animation is smooth and sleek and looks good.  The DVD also contains 3 classic cartoons with a Halloween theme.  The quality of these 3 shorts is not up to par with the main feature, but it is certainly watchable.

All in all, this is a great choice for kids for a Halloween night after you come back from trick or treating!  Enjoy!",1162425600,,827,4.54054054054054

8136254,4,B000H4JH6M,"The story is a very imaginative and adventurous.  It captures the attention of children and adults.  I had read the book before seeing the video and loved the wild and comical adventures of the characters.  The video could be of better quality but in spite of that it doesn't seem to have put children off from wanting to watch it.  How many children would love to take a ride in a Thunderbelly pumpkin?  I know I would have.  Years ago, I came across a Thunderbelly pumpkin which I brought home for my children.  After carving it and setting it by the front door, my three year old son wanted to get in it.  We have pictures of that occasion which I treasure so to now have a children's story that revolves around Thunderbellies and Halloween brings a smile to my face.  My grandchildren love the story and video.",1319241600,,814,4.445945945945946

8136256,4,B000H4JH6M,"This DVD has the Dancing Pumpkin Halloween special from Silver Hammer Studios, as well as 3 bonus cartoons including the famous Fleischer Studios 1936 theatrical short ""Cobweb Hotel"", a Famous Studios production featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost in ""Boo Moon"" from 1954; and Warner Brothers Loony Tunes theatrical short from 1966 ""A Haunting We Will Go"" starring Witch Hazel, Daffy Duck, and Speedy Gonzales.
The DVD is worth it for the classic bonus cartoons alone, but the Dancing Pumpkin is fun in its own right. The special received a Telly Award when it aired on TV. It is a story about a Jack-o-Lantern that comes alive on Halloween night, and leads 4 kids on an adventure to stop an evil ogre named Finkgrinder and his witches. They are helped by the Giant Royal Thunderbelly pumpkins that weigh over 500 pounds each and the kids ride like horses, and a pair of skeletons named Finbogi and Helgi. This is early computer animation, with a very different and charming story, with a good moral lesson.",1270425600,,1007,4.826589595375722

8136258,4,B000H4JH6M,"I bought this on super sale, so paid less than half of the current listed price, and so this was a great value!  Okay, so the CGI could have been a bit better (faces were a somewhat expressionless), and the dancing contest seems to have been added to make the movie more PC (really, are kids going to pick up on ""pumpkin diversity""?), but all in all this was a good tale and one that I had not seen before.  The three included Casper cartoons and three songs on the included CD added more value to the package, although the songs probably don't make much sense unless you have watched the movie.",1257638400,,595,4.303571428571429
8136259,4,B000H4JH6M,"We bought this on video back in 2003 and for whatever reason it is a family favorite every Halloween.  The Skeletons are some of the best characters around!  The animation is not great, but it is very entertaining and the story is straight forward halloween adventure.  The 2007 DVD we have is dark in viewing at times and the added scene of the dancing contest was new and not necessary.  If fact the dancing pumpkin story is great without that part.  I still like it and recommend it.",1223337600,2,486,4.4772727272727275
