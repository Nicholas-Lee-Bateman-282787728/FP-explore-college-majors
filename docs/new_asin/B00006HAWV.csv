1756432,3,B00006HAWV,"...well, you're still going to be waiting.
As in ""The Deliberate Stranger,"" the details of Bundy's crimes and victims are shuffled around (although this movie is more true to life as far as plain facts go) and very few real names are used. For example, Bundy is seen kidnapping his last victim, ""Suzanne,"" but then footage from the actual press conference after his execution is shown, and is it said he was executed for the murder of Kimberly Diane Leach (her real name). It can be confusing for a viewer familiar with the facts of the case; I spent chunks of time trying to keep straight in my head which character represented which victim.
There are other small film clips of the real Bundy, which really make you sit up and pay attention. I thought they were a good addition to the film; to me, it reminds viewers that this is not just a story, it actually happened.
Disappointingly, the movie puts much of its focus on Bundy's relationship with ""Lee,"" the model for Elizabeth Kendall (who later wrote ""The Phantom Prince""), and virtually ignores his friendship with true crime writer Ann Rule (who was writing stories about the missing girls during the time Ted was killing them) and marriage to Carole Ann Boone, who later gave birth to his daughter.
The movie seems to draw on Robert Keppel's ""Riverman: Ted Bundy & I Hunt the Green River Killer,"" which included gory details of Bundy's last minute confessions to Keppel. Some details are recreated for the movie, with very disturbing images. Hopefully, that would be a sure-fire cure for the ""over 200 women"" who wrote Ted while he was on Death Row to tell him they loved him (a fact mentioned at the end of this movie).
Another reviewer mentioned that the execution scenes were a protest against the death penalty. I disagree; by the end of the movie, after watching Bundy commit henious crimes in full, Technicolor detail, you don't much care what happens to him, and if he suffered, it's only a fraction of what his many victims suffered.
I could have done without the collection of ""I'm Ted Bundy!"" children in the final scene. I get the point: even your average, clean-cut person, as Ted seemed to be, can be a monster. Bundy himself said serial killers are husbands, brothers, sons, etc. I just think there was another way that point could have been made, and I found the children distracting from the story as a whole. However, if the film makers went for shock value with that scene, they certainly succeeded.
All in all, the movie is worth a watch (if the disturbing images and graphic violence don't bother you) if you're interested in Bundy's story but already aware of the facts. For the casual viewer, or someone wanting to learn more about Bundy, not so much.
POSTSCRIPT: A few days after this review was posted, I received a long, rambling, rather disturbing email from someone claiming to be Matthew Bright, the director of this film. One can only hope it was an impostor, and that the real Matthew Bright has better things to do than email people who give negative reviews to his movie (and I am not by far the only one; check out Rottentomatoes.com for more).
Bright claimed that Carole Ann Boone was not worthy of inclusion in his movie (one of my criticisms) because ""her relationship with Bundy was based on lies."" I highly doubt that Bundy's relationship with Liz Kendall, explored at length in the movie, was based on total honesty. By Kendall's own admission in ""The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy,"" she was lied to from the very beginning. So that takes care of that argument.
Bright went on to say that Ann Rule was also not worthy of mention in his film because she was just an ""ordinary person"" who was fooled by Bundy. Well, that's the point; she was also an ordinary person who happened to be a close friend of Bundy's for many years, and corresponded with him while in prison. This argument negates his later claim that Bundy was not as normal as he seemed. Obviously not, but he did manage to fool a lot of people for a very long time, as documented in other sources, both print and other media (notably A&E's Biography of Bundy).
Personally, I don't care whether Bright likes or respects Boone and Rule or not. The fact remains, they were both major figures in Bundy's life, and as such must be included in any film hoping to tell Bundy's story in an accurate manner.
Which brings me back to my main gripe about the film in the first place: it's not accurate. Other than that, someone who actually reads my review closely will note that I found several things that impressed me about the film: news clips of the real Bundy, the mention of women who wrote to Bundy on Death Row, and the shock value of the scene with the children at the end.
The fact that the director (or someone claiming to be the director) got so very defensive about the film due to a review that isn't really all that negative, should tell you something right there.",1036886400,77,4936,4.59750566893424
1756433,5,B00006HAWV,"This film succeeds as an unbiased, well-crafted and unflinching portrait of an American ""sociopath"" (someone completely disconnected emotionally from others). Just as his life and crimes are portrayed as they occurred, without any attempt at manipulating the audience, his execution is equally blunt, allowing the viewers to see the brutality of the death penalty alongside the savage violence of the man being executed. I have found this film to be the most powerful indictment of the death penalty (and most sympathetic treatment of a serial killer)of any I have seen. I recommend the film highly to any seeking a well made, startling and painfully honest film about a man with a compulsion to destroy.

1756434,3,B00006HAWV,"Someone below me says Bundy didn't take home severed heads or mess with his victims corpses but he did.  In that respect the movie keeps pretty close to the facts.  It deals with the severed heads (but not the bodies) he sometimes took back to his house, it doesn't flinch from showing how nuts he was (althought there's no real explicit gory scenes, just hints) and it's all spot on.
I'm not sure why they left some things out, like the girl he attacked outside the soriority house after he escaped, the fact that he wasn't finally busted in a white van but in another bug, or why they didn't show the first girl he had (which was the one that really broke him) whom he got back together with then broke off all ties just to get revenge.
But I don't know...the humour is just plain nuts! I mean it's dark as I don't know what, but it's all in there.  It's weird.  It is very funny at times and that's kind of worrisome to me. Should they make a movie about Ted Bundy funny? I guess that's the only way you could make a movie actually focusing on the man and not the police investigation.  I liked it more than Deliberate Stranger though.
Crazy flick, I'm sure some people will hate it just because of the way it's presented but it's interesting and better than Ed Gein.",1035590400,2,1270,4.297071129707113
1756435,4,B00006HAWV,"i think this movie just reveals what a sick sick man he was......to be in his view of the way he acted in real life was really strange...i am glad he is dead........i loved when they showed him all upset about getting executed, like anyone would feel sorry for him.......",1035244800,,271,4.44
1756436,5,B00006HAWV,"Michael Reilly Burke is phenomenal as Bundy.  If you enjoyed the Mark Harmon Bundy flick of yesteryear, you'll die for this one -pardon the pun.  Journey into the psyche of the man for whom the term 'serial killer' was actually coined.  Graphic, uncompromising look at the murders, rapes, and executions proved stimulating in this version - they were lacking in the movies Ed Gein and Dahmer and the previous Bundy flick.  A must see for all Bundy fans like me.  I had to order from Amazon.com cause the pansies at Best Buy don't sell this or Dahmer - go figure.",1034208000,2,562,4.58
1756437,1,B00006HAWV,"Wow, this movie is awful!! The only reason I gave it one star is because it wouldn't let me give it no stars. ... Every woman in 'Ted Bundy' is made to be a complete idiot ... I know Ted Bundy was an infamous charmer, but it goes a bit over the top here. Flat out this movie glorifies what happened, and the man who committed these crimes. I know Ted Bundy did awful things, that doesn't mean I need to hear 'Ted' having his way with a [very young] school girl's corpse. Sometimes it's what we don't see that is the most creepy. The other fantastic part would be the sorority house scene with 2 'sisters' in their panties jumping up and down on their beds throwing pillows at each other....ok that was the most disturbing scene in the movie. ...
I actually sat through this garbage a second time with director commentary.  I wanted to hear some kind of justification from the director of why it was made the way it was.  I did not get any, just a guy a little too proud of his project.  So now thats about 4 hours of my life I can never get back.
If you would like to see a very well done bio-pic of a serial killer, see David Jacobson's 'Dahmer', and if you want a bit more of the gore, you can always get John McNaughton's 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer'.  Both are solid, well structured, well filmed, lower budget films.",1033862400,10,1329,4.2204724409448815
1756438,4,B00006HAWV,"First of all, anyone with a interest in serial killers will probably enjoy this movie immensely. Most others will probably be offended by it and see it as a waste of [money]. The film doesn't provide much insight into Bundy's unhappy childhood except for a few sporadic mentionings, which is probably for the best. Instead, the film begins in Bundy's killing era and ends with his execution. Michael Reilly Burke was previously unknown to me, but I think he did a very good job of not overblowing the role of Bundy, as well as successfully portraying Bundy's two-sided nature. If you are looking for a character study, then the slower-paced ""Dahmer"" will probably be more appealing, but ""Ted Bundy"" will be more staisfying those viewers looking for a less cerebral serial killer film.",1033603200,4,784,4.902255639097745

1756517,1,B00006HAWV,Ridiculous in so many levels. Ted Bundy was extremely attractive which was a major factor in how he was able to get woman and have them trust him.  The guy portraying him is anything but.  Pacing and acting makes this movie hard to watch. It feels like it was made for the Lifetime network. Avoid this steaming pile of dung.,1446940800,,324,4.383333333333334
1756518,3,B00006HAWV,"Interesting rendition of a story told many times.  I have long been fascinated by sociopathic behavior so was very familiar with the Ted story.  I didn't know  that Bundy was a thief and starting out stealing wallets and being a peeping tom while pleasuring himself.  I also didn't know that his relationship with Lee was that disturbing.  This movie showed his disturbed treatment of her and her pathetically staying by his side.  I didn't know those things either they were made up or its possible I wasn't aware.  Either way it makes for a different but decent story.  Its not a great story but it wasn't bad.  This movie left out Ted's discussion with someone in jail while in Colorado when he asked in which state he was likely to be executed.  He was told Florida, well escapes and next thing the movie shows is him in Florida but unless you are familiar with his story you don't know how or why he picked Florida.  The movie also spends a little too much time at the end going through the steps that are taken preparing a prisoner for the electric chair, perhaps this was done for story filler or dramatic purposes.  You also have to love the ending when the person who flipped the switch to electrocute Ted takes the hat off in a dramatic fashion when its all over revealing its the attractive brunette.  This is by no means anywhere close in caliber to Ann Rule's A Stranger Beside me.  Ann's story is simply riveting and truly shows what a chameleon Ted was and that people who knew him well including politicians had no idea of his darker side.  This story is rather sloppily done with things thrown in for dramatic purposes and I think relies on people not being familiar with the Ted story.  Its worth a few bucks to see this movie but not much more.",1439856000,,1763,4.47962382445141

Michael Reilly Burke, whom I've never heard of before, plays infamous cross-country serial killer Ted Bundy as he engages in a multi-state spree of rape and murder.  I will commend Mr. Burke's acting, though he does sometimes stray into what I will dub ""generic killer"" mode.  In this mode, he's just spouting clich&eacute;d phrases, mainly towards his victims, which are only meant to intimidate the audience.  I was intimidated mostly by the fact that Ted Bundy was a real person.  Mr. Burke did shine at the end, right before the execution.  His character acted so pathetically wimpy that no one could possibly sympathize with him...exactly how I like my mass-murdering psychos.  Overall, this film strays into the territory of generic slasher films but manages to stay slightly clear of this simply because it's based on a true story.  That's what it brings to the table.

As an adult watching without the protection I found the movie gruesome but compelling. I had no idea just how bad Bundy was. What an extreme sociopath.,1373760000,,258,4.285714285714286
1756864,4,B00006HAWV,"This movie is really intense and offers a far more graphic portrait of Bundy as the perverted sociopath with dark and violent fantasies. Another movie about Bundy starring Mark Harmon didn't provide the level of violence and depravity that are shown in this version. Bundy was a charmer who looked clean cut and trustworthy, so it is easy to understand how he managed to elude capture for so long. Like most sociopaths, he was highly intelligent. This movie provides a glimpse into so many aspects of him including the charm, intelligence, skill at manipulation, and the darker side of him that harbored so much pent up anger and violence toward women.

Viewing this movie was deeply disturbing due to the graphic nature of it, but the graphic nature of the film was necessary in order to really get into the twisted and evil mind of Bundy. It left me with a firm conviction that one should never trust anyone, regardless of how innocent they may appear. Many who knew Bundy had no idea of the evil that lurked beneath the mask of a clean cut and intelligent law student. One thing I could not understand was how his girlfriend could have failed to recognize the dark side of Ted Bundy based on what was portrayed in this movie since he wanted her to engage in some bizarre sexual practices.

Although this movie is deeply disturbing, it is one that provides an eerie look into the mind of one of the most notorious killers in the history of the United States. I was left with a chilling reminder that you never really know the darker side of human nature sometimes until it is too late. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had not contained so much vulgar language, but in all honesty I think it was necessary to truly portray the perverted side of Ted Bundy.",1372204800,3,1760,4.531446540880503
1756865,4,B00006HAWV,"Judging from the other less than approving reviews for this film I completely expected this movie to be rather lousy. Though it is pretty much a semi- low budget film it was surprisingly better than I had expected it to be. The film plays in a very strange manner. It never really goes into the territory of some sort of fantasy style of film making but there is an essence of fantasy to it. I admit to not knowing much about the history of Bundy and maybe that helped me appreciate this film more than it probably deserves. If the facts are fairly accurate then I would have to say that this film does a pretty great job at presenting the story. If the events are fairly accurate then I would say that Bundy was indeed a much more discusting human being than I first imagined. The murders in this film are pretty disturbing to say the least. Michael Burke brilliantly creates this real life serial killer in two completely different entities. In sort of a Jeckel and Hyde manner. One is a well mannered, thoughtful, brilliant, and seemingly totally normal human being. The dark side of this person is completely sadistic, sick and truly horrific. Burke deserves credit for perfectly displaying both characteristics to a T. His acting is incredibly good considering that he had to play two completely polar opposite personalities throughout the film. The latter portion of the film from the period of his final incarceration and his execution at least seems very frank, unflattering and realistic. Burke then plays Bundy in a third personality- confused, childlike, and terrified. It is truly difficult for an actor to play all three of these to such respectable perfection in the course of a single film. His performance is truly noteworthy. So I think this film is very much worth the watch.",1367884800,,1793,4.75
1756866,1,B00006HAWV,With all due respect this movie pretty much sucked!  It didn't address anything about this guy outside of his necrophiliac activities to give you any insights into his nature,1367798400,,174,5.0
1756867,1,B00006HAWV,"A retelling of the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy.  This is basically an alleged recount of the vicious beatings, rapes and murders of who knows how many women?  This is based on fact, not just an entertaining B-flick as its admirers seem to think of it. It's wall-to-wall depictions of cruelty as committed by one sick rabid puppy.
  Michael Reilly Burke, as Bundy, shows himself to be not a bad actor.  With a decent director he might make something of himself.  Don't know whatever happened to him.
  I had the opportunity to interview Bundy's last lawyer, Polly Nelson.  She wrote a book called ""Defending the Devil"".  She was a fascinating intv and it is a fascinating book.  A better film would have been to focus on Bundy's trial with flashbacks to snippets of his crimes and his childhood.
  As it is, this is just a glossy cheap demented ripoff of horrible events.  If you like pretty boobs all in a row and buckets of blood covering attractive women get a copy and go hide in your room with a jar of vaseline and please never come out.

1756868,5,B00006HAWV,"PROS AND CONS: I bought this move for a school project and was amazed of the consistencies and accuracies of this movie. Usually Hollywood changes things to make it more thrilling, but surprisingly, Hollywood made use of this serial killer's actual life events and made it pretty accurate to the real events. The actors are very believable and the storyboard has a firm direction. The cast consist of credible actors/actresses.

RECOMMENDATION:
This movie was originally for a school project, but we have used this movie as a Saturday night movie and watched it a couple times for Halloween. I was not disappointed at all with this film, the purchase, the order, the delivery or the seller. Highly recommended movie and the price is very cheap.",1365379200,,744,4.952
1756869,2,B00006HAWV,"This is one of a series of ""True Crime"" style serial killer movies from First Look studios. From how the film plays out, it appears to be deliberately exploitive in its depiction of this notorious sociopath.

  I couldn't help but think that the producers wanted the Director to deliver a really nasty piece of cinema. I kept picturing Mathew Bright (the Director) being sent back to the set every day to make it ""more disturbing"". All in all The film has good acting and good continuity. The problem is that it becomes so obvious that they are trying to be ""shocking & disturbing"" that in between cringing from some of the brutality you can't help but be distracted by an underlying silliness. There are scenes in which bundy is portrayed in a way that resembles Saturday Night Live skits. There is also a cartoonish scene of two Sorority girls jumping on their beds having a pillow fight. This silliness problem reaches grand proportions toward the end when the preparation for his execution takes place. Probably one of the most ridiculous portrayals of Death-row procedures ever depicted in a movie.

For what it is - I guess Ted Bundy is not a totally bad film - and when I say ""for what it is"", I mean a caricaturish & sensationalized depiction. It has a dark comic quality that is pleasantly insulting to Bundy's memory and manages to sneak in some clever messages about our society as well.

There are a couple of really good documentaries about Bundy and his crimes.
 If you're looking for the real story, I would look elsewhere.",1363651200,,1538,4.677777777777778
1756870,5,B00006HAWV,"It is a pretty good movie overall. My husband and I were browsing the Prime Instant Video selections and this one caught my eye. My husband had never even heard of Ted Bundy?! No clue how that can even be possible, since it is a name that is mentioned fairly often in the media for one reason or another.

Anyway.. the movie was good. Gives an idea of his killings and personality and how he got caught. Even if it weren't based on a true story/real person, it would have still been a good movie. Some parts are pretty unbelievable - his escapes from prison/police. Interesting nonetheless and recommended.

After watching the movie, and while watching it actually, my husband was shocked that this all really happened (Bundy killing all the women). If you have a husband/friend/relative who has been living under a rock as it seems my husband has been, I am sure they will find this movie quite interesting as well.",1362009600,,916,4.613496932515337

1756872,3,B00006HAWV,"First off, I was surprised by reviews that said this was gory until I noticed the date of 2003 on those reviews.  In my opinion, even by the standards of a decade ago this is not gory when you compare it to the Friday the 13th or Halloween movies of that year.  Don't get me wrong-there are some sick scenes but it's to be expected in a movie about Ted Bundy.  This movie is not revealing into the mind of this monster or how he became the brutal killer he was. There is no in depth look at his personality at all though you already know he's crazy. It basically touches the surface of his crimes while leaving a lot about his life out.  If you are already a true crime fan (as I am) and already know of his crimes-this movie won't reveal anything more and may annoy you that so much is left out.  But if you barely know anything about Ted Bundy then this movie is pretty good because you get the idea that he was a killer with sadistic pleasures who seemed compelled to kill as many as he could while enjoying his victims terror.  I agree with another reviewer that the killings all blend together with no real focus on any of the victims.  It's almost as if they just scraped the surface of everything about his existence even by just mentioning periods in his life so they can say they included it in the film.  I did get a little bored with all the scenes with his girlfriend/doormat but didn't skip ahead for fear I'd miss something good.  I didn't other than that he was a liar which is a trait of all serial killers since they are lying to the world.  I found that the main character came off more dorky than the charismatic character that Bundy was.  Not horrible but I'm not picky and was glad it wasn't gory since ironically, I have a weak stomach for the gore while being an avid true crime fan.  I think the scariest thing about the movie is that it's based (loosely) on a real person and that these freaks are really out there hunting their next victim while seeming normal to everyone around them. Incidentally, ladies-if your boyfriend asks you to pretend your dead while have sex-he's not the guy for you!",1360800000,,2121,4.301507537688442
1756873,1,B00006HAWV,Extremely dry and slow moving. Not the best acting I have seen either.  Not impressed with the attempt to do a movie about Ted Bundy.,1359763200,,133,4.32
1756925,4,B00006HAWV,"The first time I saw ""Ted Bundy"" on TV, I only watched about 20 minutes of it.  This time around, I decided to give it a chance...I'm glad I did.  Michael Reilly Burke offers a unique portrayal of one of America's most infamous serial killers in this 2002 film.  He lacks the swarthy good looks and seductive appeal of Mark Harmon in ""The Deliberate Stranger"", but there is still something about him.  We see his bouts of kleptomania and violent fits of rage.  We see him leading his victims like lambs to the slaughter, a demonic Pied Piper.  We see the madness and evil that lurks behind the facade of respectability.  And at the end, we see what he probably was like in his final moments...a terrified little boy, stripped of his power.  The execution brought his reign of terror to an end but I'm sure that the horror still lingers in the hearts and minds of the people who came into contact with him.

I apologize for the potential spoiler, but the execution scene was pretty intense.",1358553600,,989,4.51123595505618

1756927,4,B00006HAWV,"I watched ""The Deliberate Stranger"" a long time ago, with Mark Harmon, and I found his interpretation of Bundy to be mostly caricature.  I just read the book ""The Stranger Beside Me"" by Ann Rule, and so I figured that I would give this film a peek.  I wasn't disappointed.

One thing that I liked about this film:  they didn't feel the need to sugarcoat almost anything.  They showed behaviors from Bundy's character that most likely were guessed to be true (even behind bars, Bundy wouldn't talk about ""personal"" things, so his fetishes were not completely known); and more importantly, those behaviors were most likely true based upon reading between the lines of Bundy's life.  From my experience watching film - in the United States at least - the majority of directors just wouldn't have the guts - or the power - to go in some of these directions.  Kudos to the actor, writer and director in that regard for having the courage to do this.

In Ms. Rule's book, I believe that she at least implied that the justice system in Florida was to some degree ""back woods,"" or not completely progressive in thought, mostly as they didn't have a problem with the death penalty.  I found that troublesome.  Here, the director also did not make that common mistake; all of the people in Florida's justice department were treated fairly in this portrayal.  Good call.

Has there ever been a ""perfect"" film about Bundy?  Surely not.  But overall, more than a slight recommendation here by me, particularly since I believe that this is the best Bundy flick that I have screened to date.",1343001600,,1576,4.704379562043796
1756928,3,B00006HAWV,"As a person who's got his own sense of humor, I found it to be more funny than appalling. Ted was hilarious! Just straight up jerking it outside of a girls window. Their are times in the movie where he does something and gets away without drawing any suspicion. I'll list 2 examples.

1. The part where he carry s a body wrapped in a tarp or something like it out of the girls house and into his car. Well in the scene there are people walking by and you can clearly tell what's wrapped inside simply by the shape. Perhaps the director was going for the illusion that it was to dark for those people to notice.

2. He says suspicious stuff that makes it seem obvious he's the killer like - "" Oh no! They're waaaay dead!""

As I said, I found it more funny than shocking. It does have its moments, but I felt like they could have made it more graphic and dramatic. After all what happened to these women was far from funny.",1329350400,,921,4.162921348314606

I thought they left out a lot that should have been included.  the Mark Harmon version was more detailed in giving more involved in the facts over the years.  this movie was a condensed version.

So when I learnt there was movies about the case, I've decided to watch some of them. Frankly, I think Matthew Bright movie is quiet nice. Not perfect, that's for sure, but it' a very good essay. First, you learn personnal stuff about Bundy, like he was a kleptomaniac. Michael Reilly Burke is excellent playing the normal guy ; I like the opening sequence. Although, Boti Ann Bliss is a terrible actress in this movie ; I just laughed when she's with her supposed new boyfriend at the end, and she says she can't believe she didn't see the real face of Bundy, all the time she was dating him. And, also, I don't understand why there are so much mistakes, like the BW, which is beige in real life, or, still in the movie, the victims are seated on the passenger seat, fact that never happened in the real case. But, it still works for me ; some of the scenes are so shocking, that you think it's true.

I can say too that in the french edition, there's the interview of Stphane Bourgouin, french specialist on serial-killers, who interviewed loads of them and wrote loads of books about it, talking about Bundy. But, I don't know for the american edition.",1311379200,,1281,4.382352941176471

1756985,5,B00006HAWV,"As a female who grew up in the '70's, I found the movie ""Ted Bundy"" to be a fascinating account. At the age of thirteen (close to the age of his last victim), I had seen the newspaper photographs of the chameleon-like Bundy. I had heard the stories of this serial killer, who was always portrayed as a suave and brilliant charmer. He struck fear in my heart. He was a monster. My recent viewing of Matthew Bright's ""Ted Bundy"" has now forever erased that image of the serial killer. Instead, I have a more accurate picture of the pathetic, loser freak/geek that Bundy actually was.

Years before, I had seen the made-for-TV version of Bundy's story, played by the very good-looking Mark Harmon. Actor, Michael Reilly Burke, had more of the look of Ted Bundy; good-looking, yes, but not in Harmon's pretty-boy sort of way. Burke sometimes looked pale and waxy, with dark circles under his eyes, much like Bundy sometimes appeared in photographs and news clips. I thought Burke's portrayal was excellent.

The movie exclusively focuses the story from Bundy's perspective, giving it a unique feel. This isn't about the victims or the police investigation. This is about Bundy's bizarre and twisted world. Rather then a brilliant man gone terribly wrong, he is shown as a petty shoplifter; stealing money out of a woman's purse, stealing a potted plant from a nursery, etc. He is shown as a creepy necrophiliac, as he puts make-up on one of his victim's severed head and tells her that she's ""so pretty"", kissing her lips fondly.

Bundy's insecurities are in full display as he tells his girlfriend, in a sniveling, little-boy sort of way, that he just wants to be normal. In another scene, he viciously shouts at a victim that women like her don't like guys like him. (Not an exact quote.) By the end of the film I was thinking, ""How did this nobody get to be so famous?"" and cheered at Bundy's humiliation right before his execution.

I think this is a movie worth watching, especially for those of us who grew up under the shadow of this mad man. It is very gory and is done in horror movie fashion - definitely not for the squeamish. But Bright's portrayal of this sadistic pervert is unique and riveting.",1274054400,18,2205,4.660668380462725

As far as shipping, it came on time from what I remembered so no complaints there.

Now about the MOVIE: Ted Bundy with Michael Reilly Burke might not be the most accurate version of Ted Bundy but it still touches the major points of his life. The movie itself was really entertaining and never had any SLOW moments and MBR's performance as Ted Bundy was mind-blowing. It really convinced me that he was the actual Ted Bundy. He was sinister and depraved(just the way I love it). If you're a serial killer buff, just give this movie a try.

1756987,4,B00006HAWV,"The scene where Bundy tells his girlfriend to ""play dead"" while they are in bed is truly shocking stuff and is worth the eight dollars by itself.

The film ultimately succeeds for several factors.

(1) An incredible performance by Michael Reilly Burke.  Christian Bale in American Psycho was cartoonish.  Burke plays Bundy as he was...a real person who had parts of his personality that were numingly normal and obviously the very evil and twisted parts of him as well.

(2) The film is violent but it doesn't go over the top in terms of portraying the crimes in all of their grisly detail.  As a result..it retains its objectivity and doesn't turn the film into and exploitation picture glamorizing the killer.

(3) The film shows Bundy getting his come uppance and shows him for what he was..a coward who died crying and snivelling rather than going out with some dignity.

This movie definately warrants viewing.",1258416000,5,915,4.858064516129033
1756988,5,B00006HAWV,"ok, for everyone so upset about the disregard to the victims families, for one this is a  movie about a serial killer and what gruesome things he did to these girls, not a tribute to them and the reason they all run together and appear to have no humanity as alot of you have pointed out is because THEY DIDN'T to Ted Bundy, they were just objects to him and he tried his best to keep it that way, which is why he found out through trial and error to incapacitate them early on not to subdue them to take them but mostly to shut them up so he didn't have to talk to them, get to know them, see them as human because to him they were not, they were just objects that he needed at that time to get the ever increasing release that he needed that had been building and building while out in about with Liz, in school, at work etc..People keep talking about needing more substance like seeing more of his childhood, when his childhood, if put into the film would have been a total snooze feast, he had a very unremarkable childhood with nothing very substantial that stuck out that you could disdain as a sociapath in the making, like Dahmer clearly had signs of becoming what he became, disecting roadkill and doing experiments on them and saving them in the shed, driving nails in them left alone alot to his own devices, then setting fires and putting dogheads on stakes in the ground kinda like Vlad Tempest. Ted on the other hand had a very strict grandfather that drank and was very voilent, he was a nobody in school and sort of a practical joker, he would masterbate in the janitors closet and was caught and made fun of when the other kids would swing the door open to tease him, he was developing a vivid fantasy life yes, but mostly from finding his granfathers nudey mags and detective magazines, he was a loner who was shy later who had only one or two dates, later when he discovered that he had a knack for reading and the the english language he found that by using his knowledge he could charm people and became sort of a class clown, he did so well in school that he used that to socialize because and learned from that that he could be 2 completely people, the introvert, shy at home an then the extrovert, the smartest in the class, he was then developing his mask of sanity and used this technique and hones it by observing other people and mimicking them, he knew he was different and he was made fun of cuz of it but by ""acting"" and using his intelligence he started to form what he was to become in the later years and perfected it as we saw in his short success, but by then, porn wasn't working anymore to fulfill his desires and his fantasy at first to take a girl was getting stronger and stronger. Everyone focuses on his childhood because of his unweb mother having him and then living as his sister and grandparents as parents as a pivotable thing that may have had something to do with what he did and became when in reality he was never told that his mother was his sister or her parents were his mom and dad, he just assumed and called his mom by name, the only notable incident told by one of his aunts happened  way before any event that people think might have had something to do with the making of Ted Bundy, so it seems likely that he was just born, as with most of them, a sociapath, he came out of the womb that way and it slowly manifested itself over many years, especially when puberty set in. One day one of his aunts awoke to little Teddy placing kitchen knives all around her body on the bed under the covers all with the blades pointing toward her, he was 4 years old and it is the only odd event that ever happened to his families recollections. He didn't set fires, wet his bed,kill animals or anything like that. Later when his Mom married, she took Ted with her and moved with her new husband Mr. Bundy and changed Teds last name to Bundy. His Mom was Mom and his new Dad was his Dad, he was far to young to think anything else, so people that are having issues cuz the movie doesnt show his childhood are making way more out of Teds childhood because the childhood itself was very uneventful for  future serial killer.
And the victims, we all feel badly for the victims of course but the directly clearly was trying to show exactly what happened. Ted was a lonely boy and a lonely kid and then teen, he used his ""genius"" and charm to get what he wanted and he wanted alot! he learned early that it wasn't worth getting to know someone unless he was going to get something out of it too. He wanted things, he was poor and didn't have alot of the things other kids had and he had this very well educated rich uncle that played the piano and dressed in arguile socks and was so smooth with the words and he used to visit him as much as possible because that is what he wanted to be,,, he wanted things, he had rich taste, and he was a charmer, good looking young man, he also was a compulsive thief with the affinity for socks galore, many many many socks, he had a sock foot fetish of some kind, and when he started going to college he stole everything he could get his hands on, sometimes because he needed it and sometimes just for the thrill of it, cuz it was something he had power of and could get away with and if someone stopped him on the way he would talk his way out of his and it thrilled him and he was learning. People in these reviews talk about the humor being in bad taste etc etc, or not true, but it WAS true, around this time he not only was stealing and getting away with it, you know testing the waters to see how much he could get away with but he was becoming a peeping tom and a burgular, it was escalating, theif,petty burgular,peeping tom to actually breaking into houses and walking around while people slept, and he started to think how easy it would be to find a girl and go into her room and act out one of his fantasies that were growing and growing at the time, all the while he was working and going to school. He started working as a driver for a medical supply company were many things started to go  missing, including crutches,cast material,gauze type stuff,cast stuff and a speculum <what an obgyn uses to check women for a pap smear etc> I think if the movie tried to show all these things so far it would have seriously needed 5 more hours and a director like stephen king or something, so can you see why all of this was left out. I mean if they were going to do a life story from beginning to end then sure put all these key parts in there but come on, this movie was done at a pivitol point and for a serial killer that means theres body after body, they atleast showed the thievery and went from there and yes he really did steal that plant just like that, he stuck the top out of the sunroof in his voltswagon and took off. And yes he did sleep with the dead girls bodies out in the woods, he would go back to were he left them to check for one if they had been moved and two to have sex with them again and then sleep under the stars with them, just like the movie, so for everyone that said that was so contribed, it wasnt, he had a fascination for decomposing bodies, as sick as that is, especially the hue of blueish green the fingernails would turn, and yes he did take whole bodies home with him sometimes keeping the girl unconscious with the initial whack to the head with a sears model crowbar he would keep handy just like the movie. When he first tried to act out his fantasy he snuck into a girls house thinking it would be a breeze to take her but it didn't go as planned and the blood scarred him off, she was found severely hurt with a speculum jammed into her, the second attempt he was more prepared and snuck in and choked or hit her,dressed her,hung up her nightie,made her bed with hospital corners and vanished with her, they only found blood on the pillow and nightie that was neatly hung up in her closet, then he started toying with the idea of how to render a girl silent and make her unconscious so she wouldnt struggle,run and he could have time to drive her to a preselected spot to do what he wanted to her, he tried pulling distributer wires from cars then rushing to the girls aide but soon found out that other guys always appeared whenever a girl was having car trouble, he finally figured out that if he hit someone swiftly on the head with a crowbar or club, he could could just grab them and drive off or lead them into the car with a cast on my arm routine, pop them in the head close the door, handcuff them while they were still out tot he car and take off to his preselected spot up in the mountains, and this is what he continues to do, except for the bold 2 girls in less than 4 hours at lake sam, the hitchikers, the girl at he got at the school play and the failed attempt pretending to be a cop at the mall. all the while he was dating liz kendal he would often call her right after a kill in the middle of the night because she was his touch of reality, his ""getting back to the real world"" she was his center, his way back from becoming the entity. and like the Movie he did have her do kinky sex acts with him and later having her play dead and yes just like the movie he did bring heads home, at one time he had up to 5 heads at a time in his apartment, that he would wash their hair and apply make up just like the movie because when  a couple of victims were found separate from their heads on taylor mountain, toward the end he finally told Keppel that he buries the heads apart and at different times than the bodies so a couple family members identifies the remains as not wearing that kind of make up or color or whatever and the coroners discovered that all the heads buried on the other side of taylor mountain had freshly shampooed hair. Even the pushing liz off the pier into the water was true just like the movie except in real life rafting friends witnessed it. I'm telling you that for anyone that wants to see the charming one minute and then the cold stare in a second serial killer Ted Bundy, watch the movie, yes it is graphic and yes you may think some of the things are a joke or can't possibly be real, well it will send chills down your spine and maybe the only bit that is lacking is most of the trial, but it is very very accurate and done very well. And yes he may have been able to dish it out and kill many women but when it came to him dying he was a total scardy cat using up his phone cards callinh everyone, offering himself up for science, trying to get a stay to do anything, even making last minute confessions, he did not want to do and had to be pulled and held in that chair because that monster surrounded himself with death but could not take dying himself! He was a coward trying to cut a deal all the way to the end and im so glad that monster got what he deserved, or us women would still not be safe to this day!",1255996800,2,10897,4.169909824394874
1756989,5,B00006HAWV,"I honestly had no idea who Ted Bundy was until I watched this movie tonight. I mean, I knew he was some guy who killed a bunch of people, but I had no idea he killed... what was it? Over 150 women? Possibly many more that weren't discovered? Man, what a horrible human being.

The movie focuses on the detailed ways in which Ted killed his victims.

Many of the girls ran around screaming in an attempt to run away from Ted Bundy, many of the women were tricked into getting into the same car with him which resulted in the victims being punched in the face or knocked out completely (with death soon following) and the women who were hitchhiking, well... they didn't have a chance either.

There was one woman though, who put up a heck of a fight as soon as she realized what was going on. If there was ever a reason to teach your kids to never EVER get inside a car with a stranger, this movie is it.

Furthermore, sometimes Ted would spy on certain women as they walked inside their house, then kill them in their sleep. He had many ways to carry out his brutal killing spree. He apparently traveled all over Utah and Colorado killing women over and over and over again... somehow either not getting caught, or when he WAS eventually caught, he found ways to escape from prison.

The ending of the movie is great though, which I won't spoil. It's graphic. What goes around comes around. The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the very final line of the movie which Bundy's ex-girlfriend delivered. It was just a cheesy way to end the movie I think. Other than that, the movie basically focuses on Ted Bundy meeting up with women and killing them. This is the storyline for the ENTIRE movie.

The music and certain situations made the movie almost funny at times, which probably shouldn't of happened since he's supposed to be the ""bad guy"". But as far as getting the point of the story across, i think they did a good job of showing the diff. time periods and areas he was killing people in and don't see why some people are so worried that theirs not a back story...google the back story if your so amped up about it then watch the movie!",1248912000,,739,4.36231884057971

From the standpoint of a story it's bad because it has no structure whatsoever. Multiple times I thought it would end but it never seems to know when the story is over; as if there was a story.

Where the film ultimately fails is in it's portrayal of Ted Bundy. It's not accurate at all. What we have here is a movie about a guy who acts like a complete idiot and kills a bunch of women while calling them obscene names and doing bizarre things. Sure, you could maybe ""sum up"" Bundy as a bizarre guy that killed women but he was also a brilliant up and coming lawyer with a son. None of the person he actually was is touched on. I find the film grossly ignorant in it's portrayal of one of America's most prolific serial killers. It's a bad ""shock"" film simply using the name ""Ted Bundy"" to cash in on unsuspecting audiences.

1757049,5,B00006HAWV,"TED BUNDY

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and I really mean that, independent or major studio film, this is by far a classic film. This film is about the real life serial killer Ted Bundy who terrorized many a young lady in his time and still became a celebrity. That of course was towards the end of his life on this earth, it is shocking how he raped and killed women yet so many of them loved him while he was in jail for the last time before his execution.

This film superbly written by Stephen Johnston and director Matthew Bright is what every based on true events movie should be, a straight forward in your face picture. This film is not preachy in any way, and doesn't take any side nor does it heroinize [not sure that is even a word] the film's killer Bundy. This film does not show any sympathy to the killer at all, for some reason some films like to make you feel bad for the killer by showing him/her as a person with problems, mental most of the time, some like to use a bad childhood as an excuse for a killer. Instead this film just shows you what happened, like it or not this man existed and really committed these crimes.

Bundy is played masterfully by Michael Reilly Burke, when viewing this film the first I had no doubt in my mind that I was really seeing Ted Bundy on my screen. He really plays the part perfectly, he is very creepy in one scene and wholesome and charming in the next. Matthew Bright did an excellent job as the director for this film, his direction is suburb and you can tell he really wanted to make the best movie possible. Of course you all know the story; Bundy brutally killed then raped [in that order] various women for years. He was even caught a couple of times and escaped from prison only to start doing it all again. The weird thing about it was that he actually had a girlfriend that would anything for him, that includes playing dead while they had sex [creepy]. The girlfriend was played masterfully by Boti Ann Bliss, her performance was outstanding and I can see why she was cast.

Now comes the real messed up part, when he was in jail the last time before his execution he received hundreds of fan letters from WOMEN every where. Speaking of his execution, Burke's performance is painfully good during the scenes were he is being prepped for the chair, and I mean painfully. It is the one scene that made me feel for the guy, I could really see the fear in his eyes, and his screams had me cringing. This was an excellent work of art.",1183507200,5,2527,4.2803347280334725
1757050,5,B00006HAWV,"This movie shows just how deranged Bundy truly was. I made a friend of mine, who had never heard of Ted Bundy, watch it with me and she was horrified. Her mouth hung open and her eyes were wide throughout the entire movie.",1175817600,,222,4.186046511627907
1757051,4,B00006HAWV,"TED BUNDY starring Matthew Bright is a VERY UNDER-RATED FILM. While the disturbing content is for mature audiences only, this is a good film. Well acted, the film uses a chronological approach to Ted Bundy's promising yet bizarre and eventually disturbing life. While Ted Bundy's crimes were terrible, the film also infers that Bundy suffered mentally, and his acts were to some extent uncontrollable. Some actual footage from Bundy's trail including pictures and reporter film is used in this movie as well. This is a sick flick that is surprisingly well done.",1174780800,2,561,5.108695652173913
1757052,2,B00006HAWV,When I ordered this I was expecting a gruesome horror flick. So much of the actual story was left out that this was hardly believable and the acting was corny to boot.,1171756800,,167,4.25
1757053,2,B00006HAWV,"""Ted Bundy"" may have had every intention of being a serious look at the criminal life of Ted Bundy, but good intentions notwithstanding, the film only succeeds at the sheer shock value it projects.

This film is hardly a feel-good or mainstream subject.  It really seems to enjoy its subject's depravity - - was it really necessary to show Bundy playing with the head of a victim in his apartment?  The film did very little to show Bundy's relationships with friends and family (his living victims, in a sense).  The real Bundy allegedly had a troubled relationship with his mother and his stepfather, a subject that was never touched on.  The character of Lee, Bundy's longstanding and suffering girlfriend (based on Bundy's real life girlfriend Liz Kendall) comes across as a needy, whiny character who agrees to go along with ""playing dead"" while having sex with her erratic and volatile boyfriend.  Ugh.  Were we supposed to feel sympathy for Lee?  Or perhaps for Bundy, who always saw himself as a victim?

Michael Reilly Burke does a good job playing Bundy as the degenerate he truly was.  While Mark Harmon played Bundy as a suave, charismatic ""gentleman"" in ""The Deliberate Stranger"", Burke hits closer to the truth in his dark portrayal.

That being said, even with Burke's chilling performance, the victims seem to get lost in the shuffle.  While it is true that Bundy had a large amount of victims, the true number of which has never been known, and certain composites and consolidation must be done for theatrical purposes, playing the old classic ""Rescue Me"" imposed over images of Bundy bludgeoning various victims, kidnapping various victims, or playing with their dead bodies is vile.  To Bundy, the victims were obviously playthings but to continue to perpetrate that myth years later is disrespectful to the victims themselves and their families.

To better know about Bundy and his killing spree, ""The Deliberate Stranger"" is a much better choice.  The characters are not so one dimensional and there is no shock value.",1156809600,2,2038,4.9705014749262535
1757054,3,B00006HAWV,"While the movie isn't as gory as expected being that it's made about Ted Bundy, it shows Bundy's slyness, it shows that he was a liar and a thief as well as a brutal murderer, though i don't think he would steal a topiary from the front of a nursery in broad daylight (a little exagerated)it does show him a pervert, following young girls home, watching them undress in their strangely open curtain-ed windows while he masterbates in bushes and nobody seems to care much except the guy on the second story of the building.

This film is exaggerated in a comical sense of his excessive compulsive urges of thievary, no thief should follw his example in this movie, and it doesn't show enough of what actually happened except the 2 second constant bludgeoning of women which he may have done but i know he did alot more. Not good if you want some real gore.

1757055,5,B00006HAWV,"I find it odd that this film should have garnered so many negative reviews. Perhaps people's idea of serial killer is a cartoon like Hannibal Lector who, quite offensively, is depicted, particularly in Hannibal, both the book and the film, as a superhuman instead of a monster. This film never flinches from portraying Bundy as a true sadist. As Bundy, Michael Reilly Burke delivers a performance that is brave and brilliant. Director Matthew Sweet also gives us one of the best introductions to a serial killer ever. It begins with Ted Bundy waking up. We see his face from the front (cinema convention usually begins the main character being presented from behind). The idea is that the face we see is an illusion and the truth of who Bundy is slumbers beneath his blandly handsome features.  At the start of the film, Bundy comes across as a dork. We see him in a club in a preppy suit pulling off bad John Travolta moves. Then he has water thrown over him while masturbating outside the window of a young woman's apartment. But he is dangerous dork. When he explodes into true violence, bashing a woman with a hammer to rid himself of his frustrations, the moment is truly savage and shocking. As Burke plays Bundy, there is beneath his smooth superficial charm, a perpetual sense of something dangerous and cruel just waiting for release. What the film gets right is the sociopath's unabiding selfishness. For all the cruelty he dishes out, even on those unfortunate enough to love him, Bundy always sees himself as the victim. The film is also one of the few serial killer films to ask some genuine questions about the nature of human violence. It ends with the question ""Who is Ted Bundy?"" and answers it with a series of children, including a cute little girl holding up a dead cat, giggling ""I'm Ted Bundy."" Still, what is being suggested here is not simply that baby Bundys are growing up as we speak but that depravity exists not only under cover of normalcy but within normalcy. The frenzy and violent joy of those calling for Bundy to be fried on the electric chair (here Sweet uses actual news footage), suggests there is a bloodlust in all of us waiting for an excuse to get out. Who is Ted Bundy? We are.",1146009600,6,2220,4.620253164556962

1757057,4,B00006HAWV,"Theodore Robert Bundy...known simply as Ted Bundy, the ladykiller, was no doubt one of America's most famous serial killers. I really enjoyed this movie for giving us an insight of the 30 plus murders Ted Bundy committed in the 1970's. Although it has been said that Bundy might have killed as many as over 100 women. Ted's killing spree spanned over 5 years with many young pretty women his victims. Michael Reilly Burke, in my opinion, gives a very good performance as Bundy. We all know the older movie, The Deleborate Stranger starring Mark Harmon. Though a good movie, I think this movie provides us more insight into the mind and actions of Ted Bundy. Being good looking, charismatic and very smart, it wasn't a problem for Ted to lure his unsuspecting victims into his yellow Volkswagon Bug. In addition to being a murderer, we see that Ted was also a thief who enjoyed stealing. We see that Ted was arrested twice and managed to escape from custody twice. We see him escape through a library window when he should have been supervised and in reality, Ted was able to actually escape from a jail cell. The real story is that Ted lost alot of weight in jail so that he was able to fit into a duct system through the ceiling of his jail cell and managed to escape. He was eventually caught after stealing a van. This time, there was no more escaping for Ted. This movie shows us his typical MO of luring women and usually hitting them in the head rendering them helpless and then eventually raping them and strangling them. It is said that he did decapitate some of his victims, making him seem more like Jeffery Dahmer. If anyone is interested in learning the story of Bundy, I suggest to anyone to at least rent this movie. I own it and I'm not disappointed that I bought it. Also, if you would like to see a interview with the real Bundy, he is featured on.....Serial Killers the 3 DVD set. But back to this movie, I must say that the only part of this movie that bothered me was the ending when they are preparing Ted for his execution by electric chair. I know many many lives were lost due to his actions but it was really bothersome to see them preparing him for the electric chair.... shaving his head, stuffing his rear end, putting a diaper on him, etc. This film actually shows the execution ( of the actor, not the real Bundy). According to this movie, his final words were "" Tell my family I love them"". Then he was hooded and after a ""flick of the switch"", it was all over within 2 minutes. As a horror and gore fan, this part still bothered me as we see blood pouring from his eyes while he is being executed. I am not for or against capitol punishment but I think lethal injection should have been the method of execution and not ""old sparky"". This movie makes you really wonder what goes wrong in Ted's mind making him turn into a cold blooded killer. It truly is sad, not only for him but for the victims. If only he could have gotten help ( if help would have worked), then his life and the lives of many others could have been spared. Overall, good movie to own and/or rent.",1140825600,5,3099,4.381944444444445
1757107,4,B00006HAWV,"I'm not sure what the negative reviews here are about, I think Michael Reilly Burke did an excellent job of portraying Ted Bundy's sociopathic personality, his superficial charm which hid the hollow character of a person only able to form exploitative relationships with the people around him.

In movies like ""Silence of the Lambs"" you have Hollywood-style creepy psychos who fit every silly stereotype, here you are much closer to the real thing of a sexually obsessed person with very little conscience or feelings of guilt. I also liked the hints at Bundy's personal problems, again hidden under a veneer of self confidence.

Aside from Mr. Burke, the rest of the movie is admittedly comparatively mediocre and mainly meant for some - at times rather tasteless - entertainment, considering that we are talking about real victims being portrayed.",1140220800,,849,5.144927536231884

I was watching this movie at aroun 1 a.m. and when they went through the exucauton scene it literally scared the heck out of me.

1757110,1,B00006HAWV,"This movie is inaccurate in many aspects: most noticeably to me in that right before he died, Ted Bundy said that he did not take the two Lake Samamish (sp) victims, Janice Ott and Denise Naslund, to a shed of some sort and make one watch while the other was being murdered. He only said that when he was still talking about the murders as if someone else committed them, and he said it to throw the police off. He said that he didn't get sexual enjoyment out of scaring his victims and that there was no such shed anywhere close to where he was. And in fact, the police never found one, so obviously he was telling the truth. And if you're going to automatically assume that he's lying about there not being a shed, then you have to assume he could have very well lied about everything else. Case in point, there is no shed. Denise Naslund and Janice Ott were most likely murdered in Ted Bundy's car or the woods: like all of his other victims. They also most likely died from head trauma, caused right away, also like most of the other victims. However depraved and sick Bundy was, I don't think it's fair to say he liked torturing his victims. He said the whole point in the Chi-O murders was that they were asleep while he was attacking them and therefore died before the realization of pain.

And on a last note, the movie does not do a good job of making Ted Bundy likable, which, if you've ever read any book about him, you realize he was. Women loved him; he had many friends; no one believed for a second he had committed the murders when he was arrested. In the movie, it's as clear as day that he's whacked in some way. The actor either didn't do his research or was under the direction of some crappy film-makers.

I care about story, substance, plot. People need to make the movie work. This movie was just...Idiotic. There is a part where Ted approaches a girl who says her name is Suzanne. Then moments later, it seems Ted was convicted for the murder of the girl, only now her name is Kimberly Leach (the real name of his last victim). This movie is simply a way to show you naked women. This would be good if most of them weren't ugly, and covered in blood. I might add as well that there is a scene in the beginning where Bundy is walking around stealing everything in sight. And this becomes comical. Then, a scene where Bundy stands in front of a womans window masturbating. This scene is supposed to be horrifying but then...A man leans out the window on the top floor leans out his window, sees Ted, and says ""Not you again"". This is funny. Pure & simple.

I like how they showed how he verbally manipulated the girls before abducting him- it showed how Ted could be a charmer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I wish they could've made it longer and a bit more in depth about aspects of Ted's life, like his childhood and involvement with Stephanie(the girlfriend who rejected him and is said to be the trigger of his crimes.)

1757114,3,B00006HAWV,"First I have to say you have to view this film as a different take than the pre 1986 film The Deliberate Stranger (Mark Harmon). Bright took a totally opposite approach to the complex interestingly sick mind of Theodore Bundy. The film is majority black humor in a demented way. Bright displayed Bundy's deviant side mostly throughout. As where Deliberate Stranger focused more on Bundy's intelligence, charm & charisma. It showed more of Ted's uncontrollable ego and god complex and manipulation dove more into the facts of his story. Bright's version in an accurate way displayed Ted's falling apart perverse, neurotic, obsessive, out of control impulsive deviant side. This movie is quite perversely violent. There are scenes in which Ted has acts of necrophilia and takes home the body parts of women & puts lipstick on them which is inaccurate of the true accounts of his life but simply added for shock  entertainment value.  The point of the children at the end  saying ""I'm Ted Bundy"" really illustrates the decieving normality that Ted led people to believe. He was the it could be anybody mentality. He had good looks very articulate charming and endearing on the surface but inside was the real Ted Bundy the ego driven self doubting self centered sociopath. Ironically Ted had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted but it simply wasn't enough. The scary part about this movie & his life is one will never know the demons that drove Ted and the hatred of women that consumed his life to the bitter end.

While the details are embellished somewhat to make for a more interesting movie, for the most part it is quite accurate. I think what is most intrigueing, however, is the actor who portrays Bundy, Michael Reilly Burke; he is frightening, and thoroughly makes the movie worth watching. Not only does he look very much like Bundy & emulate his characteristics well, but his acting is impressive, and gives us an entirely believable look at the monster side of Bundy the public barely saw in real life. Anyone intested in serial killer bios/movies, this one is worthy of watching. It has its scary moments.",1093651200,4,784,4.607142857142857
1757116,2,B00006HAWV,"Serial killers and their actions and motivations can be incredibly intriguing and boggle the mind. I have always been interested in what goes on in these people's heads and what brings them to the point of killing people. One of the worst, if not probably the worst, mass serial killer of all time in America's history, is Ted Bundy. Just the name alone can send chills and bring up horrible stories from years past. For those who aren't in the know or have simply lost some knowledge of him over the years, Ted Bundy murdered at least 28 women, although some say there could very well be more, between 1974 and 1978. Most of his crimes were commited in the areas of Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, and here in Washington. One girl's grave from around here I just found the other day. The movie also shows and deals with Ted's escape from prison and his soon to be recapture. He is portrayed here by Michael Reilly Burke. There is no other Ted Bundy than Mark Harmon(from 1986's ""The Deliberate Stranger""), but Burke becomes the character and for the hour and a half that you are watching him, I found myself to believe that he is this guy and that he is able to do the things that he does in the film. The best and most interesting part of this film belongs to Burke. His opening scene in the mirror was downright creepy and his subsequent ""episodes"" are blood chilling and sick. Burke has the right handsome looks and sweet charm to him that made Bundy able to pick up the women he did. But those ah schucks looks and cool presence swiftly turn deadly and sadistic and Burke really comes across as the guy you wouldn't expect to turn into a raging loony. But the problem with this film is how it seems to be more of an Afterschool Special version on the Bundy legacy than a real docu type film that digs up all the dirt and lets everyone in on this guy's psyche. Not that it is easily watchable, because there are hardcore moments here that don't shy away from the brutalness, but I meant that it seems to opnly scratch the surface of the man instead of going in deeper into who he was and where he came from. The mentioning of his mixed up family upbringing was something to of fully explore, but the movie never goes there. It jumps from one gruesome scene to the next, and even though it is realistically shot and Burke pulls it off, the whole project and story comes off as feeling a bit hollow and empty. It felt to me like a cliff's notes version of the real story. ""The Deliberate Stranger"" was 4 hours, and this one clicks in at around 90 minutes when the credits start to roll. There isn't much of a cast except Botti Ann Bliss as his girlfriend. She looks like she's from the '70's and is pleasant to look at, but many of her scenes feature how lacking she is in the acting department. Some of the most interesting moments of the film are when real pictures or real film from the news about Ted and his eventual execution in 1989 are shown. That was a fantastic touch to put in the film. And the moments leading to Ted's ultimate death by electric chair are shown and given the audience a first time look at what goes on beforehand. It was a first. These moments with the swelling of music in the background and Ted breaking down make it seem like he was a wronged man and we should feel sorry for him. Obviously, we don't, but that's just the way it felt when the scene was playing. The movie wasn't all bad at all, but it could of been so much more. It's not a film with a subject matter to be viewed as an evening's entertainment, but as a film showing how horrible a person was without the meat.",1086825600,4,3612,4.321060382916053

What about the girl whom he was in love with earlier in life who ditched him?

1757180,5,B00006HAWV,"I specificially signed onto amazon to leave a review of this film.  I'm surprised in the extreme as to what other reviewers had to say.  I thought the real horror and violence of Bundy's crimes were perfectly captured- far from being titillating, it made me want to vomit.  The sheer brutality of it, the casual way he dumped bodies as if bags of trash, I'm at a loss to see how anyone could describe it as ""exploitation.""  The man was beguiling, intelligent, charming, and a monster.  The version with Mark Harmon, though absorbing, didn't begin to capture the ""reality"", the HORROR of Bundy's crimes.  He may have killed over 100 women.  What would you have instead, an intellectual treatise on serial killing?  I thought the director's intent was to depict the brutality in a NON-gratuitous fashion, and I think he (or she) succeeded admirably.

Women were not depicted as sex objects in this film- there were no shots of sexy cleavage or lovely long lashes; women were depicted as human beings who were unlucky enough to encounter Ted Bundy.  The film did a stellar job of showing that the perversion, the view of women being mere faceless objects was in TED.  It was fascinating, compelling from beginning to end.  To my mind, this film almost ranks up there with A Clockwork Orange or Midnight Cowboy in its realistic depiction of violence.

I always think of exploitative, gratuitious violence as violence that is arousing, exciting, and I found it to be the antithesis of this.  I thought it was honest, gut-wrenching, horrifying, and very thought-provoking.  We don't yet understand what drives people like Ted Bundy, so there IS no examining what makes them tick, the best we can do is look at the pattern of their behavior as this film does.  For those of you who have seen the Mark Harmon version and not this one I won't give the details away, but the first film tried to paint him as a paradox, a decent person in other aspects of his life and that simply wasn't true.  This film sticks to the facts.  Highly recommended.",1080259200,8,2035,4.700564971751413
1757181,5,B00006HAWV,"""TED BUNDY"" has to be one of the most entertaining and accurate
protrayal of one of the most brutal serial killers of our generation, as another reviewer mentioned some parts were fiction as in the sleeping with his corpes or that the movie made him out to be a idiot when he certainly was not. (over 100 women and never getting caught!)
The actor who played TB was excellent, he really went deep into his character and even though it's sick to say..you kind of felt bad for him towards the end of the film especially when it was time for his execution. I think the director wasn't going for that but the TB actor did it so good that it was hard not to feel that way..it was kind of weird to sympatize for a maniac like that but that's what made the movie great, it played with your emotions.
Reading all these reviews i realized that everyone's got there own opinion of this movie but the average was 3 stars so you should give it shot, even better for you if you've never heard of Ted Bundy, it'll show you that even if someone is so likeable, cool and charming, there's still that monster within..and in this case a murderer.

Sure, there are important scenes which really happened, but the movie only shows what it needs to in terms of reality.  Lets face it, this film is B horror expoitation schlock, pure and simple.  It's no different than the other direct to video B horror flicks like Junior or Cheerleader Massacre that are currently on the New Release wall.  And really, you should view it as such, coz there isn't much of a message here only to see the horrible events from Ted Bundy's point of view.  Maybe that was the point.  I don't think so though.

1757183,5,B00006HAWV,"There has been a recent wave of new exploitation films centralized on serial killers. This movie about Ted Bundy is bound to get a cult following. Only twenty minutes into the film and Ted has killed several women, masturbated in public, tortured his girlfriend and is playing with mummified corpses. If this is your sort of thing, then Ted Bundy will deliver on all counts.
This is a shocking film and the cruelty that Ted inflicts on his female victims defies belief. Ted Bundy is played exceptionally well by Michael Reilly Burke in a deadpan manipulative way when he is acting normal with his girlfriend and others, but when he is out killing (which comprises about 95% of this movie) his character opens up in leaps and bounds with lashing of black humor. Check out the scene where he tries to explain the ""rape gear"" during an interrogation with a detective or how he plays a cop to get a woman into his killing vehicle of choice (a bright yellow Volkswagen Beetle) at the shopping mall.
Bundy is one dominating and controlling character and the film does disturb and is extremely sexually graphic in nature. Instead of delving too much into Bundys background, the investigation or his psychology, the director goes for straight out exploitation. So how does it pan out? The truth is that this film does nothing to honor Bundys victims, treats women very badly (except for the twist ending) and IS exploitation through and through. It is often funny and hilarious in a black sort of way. Is it morally right? NO! Is it political correct? NO! Does this film have a message? NO!........... but it sure as a hell is a ton of fun in a ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" sort of way. In short the exploitation films of the 70s have just been given a revamp in this great low-budget murder-fest that never tries to be anything more than what it is - adult popcorn fodder, and for that it gets five stars.",1067644800,17,1896,4.612426035502959
1757184,4,B00006HAWV,"Michael Reilly Burke gives a terrifyingly believable performance as Ted Bundy- termed the first ""serial killer"" by FBI profilers. Directed & Co-Written by Matthew Bright with Stephen Johnston; the movie traces Bundy's reign of terror from 1974 in Seattle. Ironically, an ex law/psychology student & volunteer for a teen crisis helpline, Bundy was born illegitimate & grew up believing his mother was actually his sister.
Ted's road to crime starts off with petty theft before graduating to being a Peeping Ted before he takes his obsessions one step further; soon feeding his interest in BDSM, & committing muggings which soon escalate to murders, rapes & necrophilia (amazingly which NZs censors left in). The gruesome FX are by none other than Tom Savini who also appears in the movie as a cop.
Bundy also drives the now stereotypical serial killer car- a yellow VW Beetle, which he uses to abduct & murder college girls, usually by asking for assistance while wearing a sling. Somehow Bundy is able to charm the ladies even though in his blazer & red bow tie he looks like the King Of The Dweebs.
Unlike Dahmer or Gein, Bundy knew what he was doing was wrong. He just doesn't care. But wait a minute: David Lane & his band of outdated fogeys would have us believe it's movies like THIS that are directly to blame for creating people like Ted Bundy!
The violence in the movie is very graphic and disturbing. But is real life violence subtle? Or entertaining? That's another one of the SPCS's problems: they seem to think all films are for *entertainment*. How many Kiwi familes would sit down in front of the box on a cold winters night with a bowl of popcorn & watch ONCE WERE WARRIORS (RP16 in NZ) together purely for *ENTERTAINMENT*?  Personally, when I have kids I'd prefer they watched NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (also RP16) over WARRIORS. (By kids I mean age 13+. I don't want to be misinterpreted as irresponsible).
In spite of the gore, this film doesn't glamorise Bundy & try to turn him into an anti-hero; though admittedly the film makers didn't take into account the feelings of the victim's familes; which may be a springboard for some to criticise or condemn the picture. That said, it's strangely gratifying at the end watching the scumbag get his comeuppance.
Now, you'll notice that I haven't really been mentioning Burke in my review: that's because when you watch this- he really DOES become Ted Bundy for the duration of the film. Burke would almost certainly have gotten an Oscar nomination if the Academy weren't so egotistical, selective & yes, wimpy.
TED BUNDY is an excellent movie, certainly not recommended for the faint-hearted; but for people with an interest in serial killers this is a must-see. Just don't watch it straight after dinner.",1065744000,,2768,4.827368421052632

A part of the movie that i enjoyed is how the direcor, and to my knowledge, added that he is the only one and no other film has shown or explained the procedure before the exection. Truely, you cant end a movie better than that. I also liked the real news and photo footage provided of Bundy, ohh yeah and how they didn't sugar-coat the killings. Just straight down to the necrophilia.

I also found it very amusing when Ted was applying lipstick to a severed head saying ""Soo pretty, yes you are"". His relationship with his girlfriend was sickening and perverse, as with his relationship with women in general. This movie failed in humanizing Ted Bundy, though it was pretty entertaining. ...

But it was more of a police procedural film than Ted Bundy, which I think is more of a character study.  The Mark Harmon version (I've forgotten the name of it) portrays Bundy as a suave law student who could basically get any girl he wanted, while at the same time having a sick and twisted side.  Ted Bundy portrays him as a total pathetic loser with a sick and twisted side, and that's what makes this film most fascinating.

All you saw was some cleptomaniac, sociopath who raped/killed/ and masterbated constantly. To the point of it being funny.

It make me fell when I dream when I run and try to escape someone but I always fall and I got problem to run and even walked, so scary. The question is WHY Ted Bundy did all theses?  Because he didn't had a father he felt he was a bastard, because he felt he didn't have a good enough job and good enough car and girls who were richer then him won't take a look at him because he didn't had money and a nice car!

Ted Bundy is about, well Ted Bundy, a serial killer/Rapist who ran rampart in the 60's and 70's.  He killed over 35 women in his spree and escaped twice.  The movie tries to reflect on his tale by showing us what he did, to some extnt.  There is no nudity in this outside of a few minutes of him with his girlfriend.  Instead he takes a blunt object and he bashes them on the head/  He them takes them to a remote location where he violates there corpse (someimes they were alive).  After that is all said and done he would go back to living a seemingly normal life.  The movie starts in the beggining of his spree and shows some of the techniques he used (most popular being a cast) and it plays all the way towards his execution.
As a movie goes there is reason why this is drect to video.  There is little doubt that this would have been a box office flop.
