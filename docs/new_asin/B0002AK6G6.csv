They did each section in half time twice (which is still kind of fast), then on to full speed.  Then the next segment and so on.  And there are NO views from the back, which makes it a little confusing.  These guys and their team are terrific dancers, no doubt.  But if you get this DVD, plan on doing a ton of back tracking before you get each section enough to move on.",1245024000,,535,3.990566037735849
