Burke has clear communication problems and some money inherited made him no happy as he listened to sounds from Wills's bedroom.

A film-with-twist received rather a less-than-more positive mark locally because, probably, a boring, meaningless ordinary Australian commoners' existence depicts average English-native blocks, usual heroes of worldwide-exported TV-sets of Aussie happy-ending serials running on fascinating landscapes of Sydney, not a customary sort of ethnic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dole-bludgers/dp/B00004YKR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">dole-bludgers</a>&nbsp;born for and used mostly to improving their English skills endlessly while passively creating jobs for service-providers.",1268438400,2,1346,7.608974358974359

The other one is a magnificent epic of exploration about the infamous Cooper's Creek expedition in which all but one of the expedition members died.  There are superb views of the Australian outback and a terrifying dust storm; the characterization is well done; and the acting is realistic.  I would give it a rating of 5.

This movie, of course, is not the one about Cooper's Creek.  If you're looking for that one, be warned.",1205193600,,543,4.673684210526316
