8348790,3,B00211EAKM,"When this show is on TV there is no profanity in it, but the shows contained on this DVD have plenty of profannity in them. I bought this to entertain my 4 year old grandson who loves the whole concept of cowboys on horses ""chasing the bad guys"" in his viewpoint of it. I had to tell him the thing was broken since I cannot play a DVD with profannity for him to hear.  Maybe I should have read more of the label etc. but silly me, I thought I was getting what was on TV.",1363824000,,470,3.8958333333333335

8348793,5,B00211EAKM,"This TV show based in Canada features an experienced tracker following people through the Canadian wilderness.  His goal is to catch up to them before they reach their finish line, a location of which he is unaware.  Their goal is to get to the finish in 36 hours, and generally speaking this goal is about 25 miles away from the start.  His tools are his tracking skills, a local guide, and a horse.  The people who run only have a map, compass, and knowing where the finish is. The chase is on.  If you ever wanted to watch a high action reality tv show that gets  your blood pumping this is what you want.  I am completely addicted to this show.  A must watch.",1254873600,8,663,4.290322580645161
