8313713,5,B001JT8Q98,My mother is in her 60's and was diagnosed with MD about 20 years ago.  She is otherwise a very active and healthy young senior.  She was faced with losing her driving privileges since she can't pass the vision test.  She has been researching and looking for something that may help for the last few years.  She came across The Santa Fe Protocol.  She researched it and came to Santa Fe from AZ for the treatment.  She had 5 treatments this week and already is noticing a drastic improvement in her vision.  This is a life changer for her.........it almost feels too good to be true.  I will update with more information once she has vision tests and the full impact of the treatment has been seen(I guess it will continue to improve for a couple more weeks).......I'm so excited for her and glad she found out about this treatment!  The protocol also appears to be long lasting which is great news for those who don't live in Santa Fe.,1400198400,5,936,4.458823529411765

For those of you with little or no hope left, take heart!
