8146162,5,B000ILYYXA,"This outstanding documentary features the Queen family, a friendly clan who delight in playing old timey music. They live in the mountains of western North Carolina and play a type of folk music descended from English, Scottish and Irish roots that formed the basis of bluegrass, country and gospel.

The charming Mary Jane Queen is the proud matriarch who presides over a family where virtually everyone either sings or plays an instrument. Banjos, fiddles and guitars combine to play beautiful traditonal songs, such as ""Cabin On The Hill"", ""Liza Jane"" and ""Roving Gambler"". The family also has a fine collection of homemade banjos, including one made by an ""old timer"" from a Prince Albert tobacco can. Brief interviews with family members and some gorgeous mountain scenery are also shown. But the music is the centerpiece here and what a glorious centerpiece it is. Enjoy!

PS: Be sure to also check out ""Special Features"" from the main menu, as it includes three additional short docs - ""The Ballad Of Mary Jane Queen"", ""Queen Family Mountain Music"" and ""Outtakes"" - that provide for even more music and family footage than the movie itself.",1213488000,7,1147,5.0
