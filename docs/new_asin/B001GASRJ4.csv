8304711,5,B001GASRJ4,"A very strong movie about the price which Russians paid to stop German tanks in 1941-1945. The movie makes a very strong impression mainly because of the last 20 minutes, when the battle of 18 russian soldiers against german tanks is shown. The play of Leonid Bykov, in the role of private Svyatkin, is great!",1238025600,,309,4.636363636363637
