7548725,2,B018IDVB6W,"One of the many charms of Ben Stiller's 2001 fashion world satire Zoolander was its humble-ish beginnings. The idiotic supermodel was created as a joke for a fashion show, and grew wildly from there. The movie itself took some time to finds its feet on the runway, but not only proved to be a hit but arguably Stiller's most enduring, most quotable comedy. It had fun poking at celebrity culture and the quirks of the ""incredibly good-looking"" people of the world. And apparently everything Stiller had to say about those people was said 15 years ago, because the unnecessary, mostly unfunny sequel Zoolander No. 2 is about as fresh as Cross Colours and Starter jackets.

The best, most inspired ideas come early on, and were sadly given away by the plethora of trailers and promos. A harrowing chase through Rome's city streets finds Justin Bieber at the business end of an assassin's gun, but before he dies he stops long enough for one last selfie. It's the kind of silly, self-deprecating joke that made the original film a cult favorite, but moments like this are few and far between. A flurry of news reports from pretty much every TV journalist on the planet fills us in on Derek Zoolander's misadventures since we last saw him. The dopey model's wife (Stiller's actual wife, Christine Taylor) was killed by the collapse of the Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Cant Read Good and Who Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too, which was built on flimsy model materials because he's...well, a dope. Also caught in the destruction was Zoolander's narcissistic buddy, Hansel (Owen Wilson), whose face bears such a ""hideous"" scar he's gone off into hiding. Zoolander has been living as a hermit(crab) in the frozen tundra of New Jersey ever since, until Billy Zane (Billy Zane!!!) comes walking back into his life with a mission to find out who is killing pop stars.

The original movie was delightfully absurd, taking place in a world where Zoolander's ""Blue Steel"" look could stop bullets, daggers, and people right in their tracks. Stiller cranks that ridiculousness up to a new level but in the process leaves behind the digs at the industry which was its strength; in favor of goofy spy movie that has more in common with Austin Powers. Zoolander joins with Hansel (who has been living in the desert as part of a polyamorous commune with Kiefer Sutherland) and a sexy agent (Penelope Cruz) from INTERPOL's fashion division to find the murderer, while at the same time reconnecting with his estranged son, Derek Jr. It turns out Zoolander's son is overweight, and a painful gag about whether or not this makes him a bad kid goes on for an interminable length of time.

The stupid murder plot keeps getting in the way of a much better storyline perfectly suited for knocking our superficial culture. Zoolander and Hansel have been out of the game for years and are now seen as relics, and their embarrassing attempts to fit back in provide some of the film's most pointed and hilarious scenes. Their first runway show back ends in utter disaster at the hands of trendy designer Don Atari (an intentionally intolerable Kyle Mooney) and gender-neutral model ""All"" played by a cat-like Benedict Cumberbatch. While the ""All"" gag doesn't work, it's at least somewhat inspired, which can't be said about much else.  Will Ferrell as the returning villain Mugatu and Kristen Wiig as the Donna Versace-esque Alexanya Atoz help liven things up a little, but not even they can help Zoolander No. 2 be anything more than out of style.",1455667200,2,3528,4.816831683168317
7548726,4,B018IDVB6W,"Zoolander 2
 I laughed and laughed over and over again at the silly stuff Ben Stiller has brought to the screen in ""Zoolander 2"".  This  is comedy farce as fun and funny as it gets.  I say this as one who does not relish Ben Stiller and his works so a reader might want to double any praise I show him.  Stiller wrote, directed, produced and stars in this very funny film.  He does have a great deal of help.
 He had four other people helping in the writing which often foretells disaster in a script.  But a lot of the stuff in ""Zoolander 2"" makes up discreet little scenes so it doesn't matter much here.  Stiller, by the way, has directed a now total of 16 film and TV projects including ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""The Cable Guy"" so we need to evaluate him as a genuine Hollywood director and not simply as an actor with enough pull to be allowed to make the odd film.
 Stiller and co-star Owen Wilson reprise their rolls as fashion models Derek Zoolander and Hansel, once the greatest male models in the world but now in retirement, even exile, after a tragic accident.  Interpol detective Penelope Cruz maneuvers them into coming to Rome to stage a comeback fashion show and to help Interpol solve a series of murders.  The movie opens with a long chase scene that leaves pop star Justin Bieber shot about twenty times but who has the courage to leave a clue to the murders before he expires.  Wags have had fun with Bieber's on screen death as one can well imagine.
 The film is so over the top as to be outrageously funny.  Stiller brings in dozens of famous people who seem to enjoy making fun of themselves.  Among actors with roles ranging from supporting to cameos we have Benedict Cumberbatch, Mila Jovovich, Will Farrell, Kristen Wiig, Billy Zane, Kiefer Sutherland, John Malkovich, Olivia Munn, Alexander Skarsgard, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Ali Mang and Kyle Mooney.  That makes for a bunch of famous and near famous people to watch for.  But wait, that is not all.  TV news people Matt Lauer, Katie Couric, Christiane Amanpour and Jim Lehrer also appear and as themselves doing news stuff.
 Stiller somehow has managed fashion heavy weights like Tommy Hilfinger, Valentino and Anna Wintour to appear in roles that ridicule themselves.  They are made to seem like shallow and grasping fools but don't seem to mind.
 Just for fun, Stiller brings in a pack of pop stars as place holders including Katy Perry, Demi Lovato, Lenny Kravetz, Susan Boyle, Soledad O'Brien, Ariana Grande, M. C. Hammer and Sting.  Sting and Bieber have roles that are important to the story.
 This silly, funny romp runs for one hour and 42 laugh laced minutes.  As one of the producers Stiller lavished $50 million on making the film which took in a worldwide gross of $26 million over the 4 day President's Day week end.  This three saw blade comedy carries a mild 'PG-13' rating.
 I liked this one, it made me laugh.",1455580800,17,2904,4.577519379844961
7548727,1,B018IDVB6W,"DO NOT BRING KIDS TO ZOOLANDER 2, whatever you do ---- THE RATING SHOULD'VE BEEN X --- Or maybe PG - 21.  :/
FILTHY as well as painfully stupid, DO NOT bring kids (and there were plenty in the theater, misled by the IRRESPONSIBLE ""PG-13"" rating.

There was almost a plot but it was literally drowned in awkward, cliche'd sewage.

Supposedly the first one wasn't as grossly in-your-face alternatively every-which-way sexual --- I'd absolutely love to smack the cretin who rated this PG-13, I went with an almost-13 yr. old (who saw the first one, so we assumed this would be ok....) & regret not walking out.
Even if I wasn't so pissed we were so badly misled by the PG-13 rating, I'd give it one star & feel generous.",1455494400,3,717,4.5
7548728,3,B018IDVB6W,"Whats it about?

After a devastating accident soon after the conclusion of the last film, Derek Zoolander went into hiding from society. But when Billy Zane delivers an invitation for him to be in the biggest fashion show in the world, Zoolander decides to get his life back together, with a little help from his old friend, Hansel.

What did I think?

The key to enjoying this film is to lower your expectations  it had little to no chance of matching the genius of the first film. It is, however, a nice homage. There are enough genuine laugh out loud moments to keep you engaged, some fun cameos, and enough of a plot to tie it all together. But lets all hope they don't do Zoolander No. 3.",1455408000,2,693,4.390625
7548729,3,B018IDVB6W,"Let me get this out of the way right up front.  This movie is dumb.  Really dumb.  So dumb and purposely so, I liked it.  Not as much as the original Zoolander from 2001, but primarily because this movie is just more of the same, and the music isn't as good.  I will grant you that comedy is always in the eye (and ears) of the beholder, but when we find that Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) has become a hermit crab and isolated himself in a cabin in desolate, remote Northern New Jersey, I had to laugh.  Then we find out that his male modelling partner, Hansel (Owen Wilson) has found himself in the uncharted deserts of Malibu along with a dozen lovers, more laughs.  Then we find out all of Hansels lovers are pregnant, including old men, old women, very young women, a goat and Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), and Im laughing even more.

Sure this is a PG-13 rated SNL skit on steroids and even includes alum, and unrecognizable, Kristin Wigg as English-mangling Alexanya Atoz, so more laughs.  Then there is a long line of cameos that fly by so fast, you are guaranteed to miss a few.  The capper is actually the opening shot of Justin Bieber being riddled with bullets but stays alive long enough to send out one last Instagram.  I think if you like the original, 15 years is long enough to wait for more of the same.",1455408000,34,1323,4.381147540983607

The original Zoolander was a sleeper hit, pulling a shocking number of laughs from what seemed like a very thin concept, and its delayed sequel, unfortunately, pales in comparison. Like many folllow-up efforts from the same genre (Austin Powers and The Hangover, I'm looking at you here) Zoolander 2 falls into the trap of constantly re-hashing the gags that worked the first time. Why innovate when the well's right there waiting for your return, after all? What new material it does bring to the screen is often good for a chuckle, but not deep enough to mine for richer material. Benedict Cumberbatch's gender-bending role as a competing supermodel is a great example. We get about three minutes of big laughs from the character, but then he's spent and is cast aside. Even the returning faces seem lighter and less interesting, particularly Will Ferrell's big-haired fashion mogul, Mugatu. They're propped up with sight gags and cheap one-liners, but there's no masking the lack of inspiration in their writing and performance. Humor arrives in sprinkles throughout this film, like a series of not-quite-ready pitches for an upcoming episode of SNL, but that's not good enough to make up for a bland, obvious storyline and an aimless, meandering pair of central character arcs. Pointless and under-cooked, or maybe over-cooked, considering how long it was left to incubate. Whatever the cause, it's a swing and a miss.",1515110400,,1571,5.06949806949807

7548860,2,B018IDVB6W,"Saw this movie in theaters when it first came out.

I enjoyed the first one a lot. The teaser trailer for this movie got my hopes up. I tried to avoid the trailers (cause these days they always give away most of the stuff it seems like, especially if the company knows its gonna bomb). So even with that I was able to see a few clips here and there that I was trying to avoid cause I didn't want to know what the plot was.

I basically started coming up with a plot in my head but ignored it as best as I could and watched the movie with high hopes and with fresh eyes. I was the only person in the theater the day I saw it (which isn't a good sign sometimes). I won't give away any plot really but the movie did not live up to what I felt it should have. They re-used a number of jokes from the first movie, which in some cases is okay as long as you mix it in with way more new jokes so you have a few call backs maybe.

The plot was kinda all over the place and forgettable. It really did feel like it was rushed and/or not thought out to well. They had a few throwbacks to the first movie to try and make it work.

This next section will be SPOILERS just in case anyone doesn't want to see.

-------------------------------------------

One of my main problems was the plot I kinda figured out in my head from seeing the few clips before I saw the movie felt like it would have worked WAY better then what they tried to do. They had Mugatu return (which was surprising because it sounded like Will Ferrell wouldn't bleach his hair again for that role and thus wouldn't be in the sequel but he did show up). And there were a few funny moments but that's where the movie started to go pretty far off the deep end. The side story with Derek's son really seemed pointless and wasted. I am guessing they needed to fill more time and thats why that was chosen but who knows.

My thoughts before going to the movie was that Derek could still have gone into hiding or retirement, maybe not kill off the wife but maybe divorce or something? The ""Center for kids who can't read good, and want to learn other things good too"" could have been made where they lost money cause it's a bit of a stupid school and who is gonna pay for keeping it up etc from the first movie. Instead of making up a story that it was built but built crapy. Or if it was built crapy during the first movie have it closed down or it did collapse but didn't kill anyone or something.

Anyways Derek is retired, Hansel maybe modeled for a bit longer but then retired too, or is still a model just not as popular anymore these days cause modeling has changed (like the movie hinted at). Meanwhile the bad guys from the first movie that were higher up then Mugatu are still at it and Mugatu took the fall for it all. And maybe a call back to some hand models. Derek is forced out of retirement because of these assassinations (still happening like the original plot) then goes to see Mugatu in prison, hilarity ensues like the original plot but he agrees to help Derek if he gets to help take down the higher up bad guys. Derek agrees they let Mugatu out on bail buddy buddy type team up. They go see Hansel at some point and try and find out whats going on. Mugatu helps them because he still has contacts in the modeling world, maybe some more call backs to hand models.

Fountain of Youth get teased a bit maybe, but main plot is finding out why some of these models are being killed off by the higher ups. Maybe previous models left over from the mind controlling that need to be taken out because they might know something, or they are the ones killing other models because the mind control messed up. Or maybe both. Maybe they know to much who knows. Then when they get close Mugatu double crosses Derek and goes for the higher ups (for revenge for being left as the fall guy), or after they take out the higher ups Mugatu escapes and takes over their position or something.

Another thing I thought about was what about residual effects of the mind control. Maybe a side story on that, or make it part of the main story. Derek still is messed up from ""Relax"" or maybe the song isn't even needed and trying to model causes him to mess up because of that? Almost like PTSD (Post traumatic stress disorder)? When he tries to model? Idk Worth a look into.

The whole fat kid side story was just kinda stupid. But keep pushing for Derek is out of the loop on the way modeling is these days story during it. They could have also ended it where Derek accepts that he is no longer a model anymore, or to far out of the loop and start enjoying life doing other stuff hanging out with Hansel, maybe getting back with his wife. Since they weren't afraid to have her show up in cheesy effects as a ghost which made no sense in the original plot. Basically the original story, no matter how far out it seemed, it was still grounded in reality. It was believable that it could happen. Having ghosts of dead wifes show up kinda throws it off and makes it almost like a one off joke. Almost as bad as if he woke up at the end of the movie and we find out it was all a dream.

Now all that aside, I was trying to remember what plot I had come up with prior to seeing the movie and just going off some of the trailers. A few stuff I added after seeing the movie to help tie it together or to keep a few stuff from the original plot but really I left the movie theater that day thinking the story I came up with in my head would have been way better then what they did and I came up with it way back then within like 15 minutes of seeing a few clips online that I was actively avoiding before seeing the movie. But it's hard to remember all the stuff I thought of before seeing the movie cause I tried to forget it in case the movie had the same type of plot I thought it was gonna have. But it would have been better if it had, cause even though I would have predicted it, it would have been more enjoyable to watch instead of what I saw.

---------------------------------

End of SPOILERS.

So yeah I kinda was let down by this movie. I don't remember laughing at all really that day, the movie and story were forgettable other then how disappointed I was after seeing it. I get if they wanted to rush and get it done with so some of those people could get a paycheck. I was thinking maybe Will Ferrell's contract was only for a few scenes and so they had to ditch better ideas and not have him in the movie as much, but he is in fact in the movie for about half of it. And he was one of the really funny parts from the first movie ""I INVENTED THE PIANO NECK TIE! what have you done Derek? NOTHING!!! NOTHING!!!""

Maybe it was Ben Stiller and he just wanted to get it over with? Kinda felt like he wasn't into it as much as he could be. I almost got the impression he was tired during the movie. And these days I rarely see him in anything, even before this movie came out. But again all of this is off of memory from so long ago I would have to watch the movie again to be sure but I don't think I could. Otherwise I might be depressed and bored watching it again.

I was a bit mad later on thinking back, back then when I felt the plot I had come up with was way better then what they had done. I don't make movies, I would like to and all the people who got the green light and worked on that movie allowed that to happen makes me a bit mad. Lots of people were looking forward to a sequel to the first movie cause it was a cult classic, I can't think of anyone who didn't enjoy the first movie.

It was almost as bad as Joe Dirt 2, or maybe it was just as bad. I understand call backs to previous jokes, stories, characters but im surprised they didn't try more new stuff.

They also had a number of cameos, some of which were from the first movie so that was a bit enjoyable but some of them were only for a minute or two. Others just a few minutes.

Before the movie came out there was already buzz cause of the runway show Derek and Hansel showed up for in France/Paris? A month or so prior to the movie being released which was shown on a bunch of sites like reddit etc which helped create buzz without mentioning the movie.
The Teaser trailer also got my hopes up even though it showed nothing, it seemed more thought out then the movie itself. But maybe the people who made the movie knew it was gonna do bad so they had to hype it up as best they could to try and get as many people to buy tickets before seeing any reviews?

Pros:

1. Some call backs to the first movie (though some were not a pro).
2. Most of the cast returning for this movie.
3. Umm.. I got nothin

Cons:

1. Too many call backs to the first movie and/or not enough new jokes
2. The plot was forgettable and kinda boring.
3. Side story with the fat kid wasn't entertaining.
4. They seemed to have rushed the story and/or not thought out to well
5. They wasted potential. This movie could have been so much better without sacrificing budget. So many little and big changes that could have made this movie a worthy successor in my opinion.

I know this review isn't the greatest. I usually don't review movies on amazon but seeing it on the list reminded me and I just felt like I should put up a review for it. If you enjoyed the first movie, you might like this one. Heck you might enjoy this movie regardless and if so I am happy for you. I unfortunately didn't enjoy it like I was hoping I would. I went in avoiding as best I could all the trailers (other then the first teaser that showed nothing), all the talk, and even tried to ignore/forget a plot I came up with from seeing the few clips and chatter I did see/hear and went in with an open mind. I wanted to like this movie but it just wasn't that good. And I highly doubt we will ever get a 3rd one because this movie seemed to bomb and I would be worried if they made a third one cause it might turn out worse then this one.",1513382400,,9921,4.104177411036617

The art of enjoying Stiller's comedic style is to let go of reality, get in the zone, and just laugh at it. Maybe have a margarita first. Then laugh a lot, and very hard. I'm grateful that he has given us the goofy yet brilliant pair- Zoolander and 2oolander. If you think it could have been done better a) you're wrong, and b) go do a movie yourself and see what happens. Saw 2 in theater along with about 20 other people total on opening weekend, and that made it even funnier as each group seemed to catch something in the background others of us hadn't- but became aware of by their independent laughter. I happened to be the one with the dubious honor of noticing the bulges in the pants in the boating scene... and if that's not funny to you, then there is an insurance seminar needing your help somewhere, go there instead.

Zoolander 2 is an example of a lazy movie driven by stars that the producers were unwilling/unable to say no to and this is the result. The writing is self indulgent and 90 percent of the jokes land with a catwalk crushing thud. The original was ridiculous to be sure, but the character of Matilda really grounded it and spoke for the audience and that's what kept the movie on course so you could enjoy Zoolander and Hansel's antics. The sequel takes jokes that worked in the first one and takes them to a place where they simply aren't funny. The best thing about the movie is Kristen Wigg as a Donatella Versace style villain and of course Mugatu is wonderful as always until the RIDICULOUS ending.

Writer Justin Theroux saved the only funny line in the movie for his cameo when he tells Ben Stiller to have a kid back to the orphanage before it gets too late at night. The only thing funny about it is Will Ferrell, who can pretty much save any movie he is in. DO NOT waste your time watching this.

Theres a lot more story here, kind of like a spy novel, only its easy to follow. And there are lots of celebrity cameos which plays up all of the dumb fun. The funniest bit is the lampooning of the selfie as Derek and his fudgy muddled offspring (he has a son, and when hes trying to figure out who it is amongst a group of schoolboys playing a sports game he gets it hilariously wrong) go bonding driving through London. At first his son, whos not surprisingly much brighter than dear old dad, continues to caution Derek over his reckless driving. But after a few near misses he gets into the verve and begins to enjoy dads driving shenanigans and gets into selfie mode. And then Derek has another narrow miss that causes him to lose control and have his car flip sideways over and over and over again in slow motion. I thought that bit was fantastically funny and it had me momentarily. Kind of reminded me of the idiot models in the first one cavorting around at the gas station in the first movie. There are a few hard won chuckles throughout, but thats partly it, Stiller and Wilson have to try too hard to sell the laughs, and that hurts the movie.

You see, I had a holiday freebie day from work and decided to take a bus while I still lived in the boonies to the closest major city to see a movie. I was feeling somewhat ill that day and decided I was only going to see one film so that I could go take the 45 minute bus home and rest.

One option was an indie film starring Liev Schrieber and Tobey Maguire where they play a legendary chess game. The plot sounded original and I knew for certain that any kind of indie film wouldn't last a week in the multiplex. However, I really enjoyed Zoolander 1 and had high hopes that the sequel would deliver some laughs while I felt infirm.

I feel like I made the wrong choice.

While watching Justin Bieber die in the first 3 minutes made the ticket worthwhile, it's like the writers believed moviegoers are brain dead morons and that we all concur that Malibu is located in the Sahara desert. Some gags are back including Owen Wilson's peyote tea drinking orgy party buddies but the writers made the characters so stupid that the few laughs turn into brief grumbles.

While I find some scenes to be really funny (I laughed when Zoolander meets his obese son), the fashion police Interpol is dumb and a lot of the gags to be mild giggles at best. Will Ferrel played Mugatu very well, but again the gags were so dumb that I wondered why they waited so many years to make a sequel. The movie would have been better if they made it 8 years ago.

Of course, this franchise has other, deeper, social issues that mire it down, as they did the original. One would think that in 2017 such gimmicks would actually win over the mindless crowds that cough up big bucks to see equally mindless movies. Not so. This movie gained little from the critics, and even less from Amazon movie reviewers. I gave it a generous 3 stars due to the effort put forth in trying to assemble a large cast, whose cameos had the potential for greater laughs than all the lines spoke by the main actors combined. Top amongst these are Keifer Sutherland, Sting, and Tommy Hilfiger. Music tracks were keen though, and the end theme remake of FGTH's RELAX was enchanting.

I came out pretty satisfied. It was silly, campy, a little over the top (which was to be expected,) and in the end? A fun movie to watch when you've got time to kill and want some quick laughs.

This is not one of those movies! If you have any morals or good values in your life don't choose to fill your mind with this garbage. The movie is full of completely inappropriate sexual comments and scenes that involve children and animals. Such as anal, sodomy, orgies, sex with animals, homosexuality, birthing children into a family of orgy members, 2-way sex on one female, and the list goes on. And these things are being told to a child, (Derek's son) about his mother, how gross! The movie also makes fun of the bible. Using its stories to make jokes. Such as Adam and Eve and (Steve). Characters dressing up at Jesus with the crown of thorns. And ""All"" who is a no gender person who married himself. I made a huge mistake by watching this movie and I can't get that time back in my life. Don't desensitize yourself to this garbage. What happened to good old fashion humor?

The combination of low expectations and many laugh out loud moments made this quite a pleasant surprise. Don't go into it looking for Sophie's Choice or even something 'as good' as the original (seriously, how often is a sequel as good as the orig?). Go into it because it's a fun comedy and a continuation of the ridiculously silly story of Derek and Hansel, and I think you will find that it is actually well worth the watch (e.g. as a guilty pleasure on a lazy day). Loved the many silly cameos and even the nod to the 'Jitterbug' scene. They did a great job with Derek's stupidity, which continues to me laugh (which ironically takes fairly intelligent script writing. Take for example when everyone supposedly figures out who is behind it all, and the camera turns to Derek to reveal it, and he says 'who?').

The stuffed basically everyone into this film, from Tommy Hilfiger to Willie Nelson to Kiefer Sutherland to Susan Boyle. Justin Bieber gets shot enough times to cause a tryphobia sufferer to have a seizure, Benedict Cumberbatch is All (with a hot dog, not a bun), and John Malkovich is in prison for crimes against fashion. The whole thing is just plain silly!

Given the Zoolander character, I do not know how this film could have been improved. Yet, it barely broke even at the box office and it was panned by critics and moviegoers. Really, what do people want from Zoolander? One would think they would want Zoolander 2. One would think they would want to see Hansel go into a stealth mode that was so awesome that he was able to hide on top of a spinning helicopter rotor. One would think they would want to see Sting deliver that Star-Wars-The-Forse- Obi-Wan-Kenobi-Vader-vibe that he did. One would even think that they would find Billy Zane showing up to reel Derek and Hansel back into the game would be cool. One would think they would really enjoy that roof-top scene that featured Neil deGrasse Tyson and Katy Perry. One would think.

All I know is that Penlope Cruz and Susan Sarandon have never looked better and the climax scene blew me away when ""El Nio"" was released.

It suffers from the same flaw that all sequels done after 15+ years have. They pretty much copy what worked 15 years ago, but do it bigger and louder. So there's lots of rehashes of old jokes and a very similar plot line. But it's still funny, which is why we watch a Zoolander movie in the first place.

If you're the type that prefers sophisticated witty humor, run far away. But if you laugh at farts and love movies like The Waterboy and Dumb and Dumber, then I have a hunch you'll find some entertainment value here. There's a part at the end of this movie that literally made me cry for like 5 minutes because I was laughing so hard. It was RIDICULOUSLY stupid, but man did I find it funny.

So is it as good as the original? Nah. But did any of us expect it to be? NO WAY! So maybe I enjoyed it because my expectations were low. But maybe I just love and miss this far-fetched stupid-guy humor. Either way, if you're a fan of Derek Zoolander, I recommend watching this one through.",1486080000,,1258,4.105691056910569

I can see why a lot of people gave this movie a lot of negative reviews as it doesn't even get remotely watchable until about an hour in when you get a little bit more of Kristin Wiig and Will ferrell, the latter of whom helped carry the funny in the first movie.

If you're going to have the main villain (who is also the main source of actual funny in this movie) not show up until the last half hour of the movie then you have real problems with your writing.

The jokes are kind of beaten to death and outside of the scenes with Will Ferrell and Kristin Wiig this movie is almost completely unwatchable.",1485388800,,721,4.248175182481752

Kristen Wiig developed another unique character but even her talent couldn't detract from this sad mess of a movie (I am also a fan of Cruz and Ferrell, and Ben Stiller has provided great laughs in ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Tropic Thunder"").

Zoolander might have been funny in its parody of the fashion industry, superficiality, and excesses in general (I say ""might have"" because I wasn't a fan of the first film, but it was tolerable). This is essentially the same...the characters and jokes haven't changed or evolved so it's actually a bit depressing to watch in its repetitiveness.

Rightfully so, the movie didn't do so well at the box office. Good to see that with some films, audiences aren't being duped into watching absurd mess.

Original as well as classic jokes from Zoolander, it picks right up where the first one left off with many actors including Will Ferrell reprising their original roles, and also hilarious new characters like ""Don Atari"" and ""Alexanya Atoz"" played by Kyle Mooney and Kristen Wiig respectively.  FULL of cameos from just about everyone it seems, including many big names in fashion, cable ""news"" and musicians and actors alike.  Typical slapstick Stiller humor very much in the vein of the first Zoolander; could have been more original but I'm glad to just have a Zoolander sequel.",1484092800,2,826,4.871428571428571

7551276,5,B018IDVB6W,"To enjoy ZOOLANDER 2 is to ignore all the usual ways in which you measure fine filmmaking (like plot and story arc), because a) it's a hot mess, and b) it's still funny. Nostalgia fuels the comedy, from the moment we spot Derek in all his high-haired, narcissistic glory (and brief morose ""hermit crab"" stint) and Hansel in his loopy, laid-back ditziness. There are few better buddies to pair up in a buddy comedy than these two. (They're well-matched by Penelope Cruz as a swimsuit-model-turned-Interpol-investigator; she holds her own against the returning stars' wackiness.)

That the storyline -- something about the fountain of youth and Derek's son -- makes absolutely no sense (and is uncomfortable to boot, given that it makes fun of a young boy's weight) doesn't fully detract from the enjoyment of seeing Derek and Hansel back in action. But make no mistake, this movie is silly, crude, and even a bit outdated with all the jokes about supermodels, their (lack of) intellect, and their obsession with weight. It's also sometimes irritating in its zany mindlessness.

Honestly, it's not as bad as they say. Yes, it's more a collection of gags and celebrity cameos arranged around a very minimal and silly plot, but really, did you expect anything more than that? The first Zealander was hardly Academy Award material either, if you recall.

I enjoyed the film. It had a few good laughs, and a few groan moments, but it was not the travesty that it has been made out to be. It certainly wasn't as bad as Anchorman 2.

It's still a good movie, it's nonsense though. There were a few plot threads from the first one that were tied up in here. Otherwise, you actually don't have to see the sequel. I don't know, if you want something completely ridiculous, give this a go.
The first one was better in my opinion.
Kristen Wiig was the star of the show in my opinion, i think if we were to have a show about her i would give it a 10. She was freaking hilarious.",1469664000,,558,4.175925925925926

7551933,3,B018IDVB6W,"3 Stars. Like your favorite pair of jeans (filled with holes, not perfect, but super comfortable), Stiller brings back the stupid found in the original, Zoolander (2001). Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson once again reprises their roles as Zoolander and Hansel. After a fatal tragedy that killed Zoolanders wife, Matilda (Christine Taylor), and gave Hansel a facial scar, the duo stopped speaking to each and went into hiding. Billy Zane finds Zoolander in a secluded arctic cabin and Hansel in a desert commune, where hes in a relationship with an orgy. Zane gives them invitations to participate in the latest fashion show from Don Atari (Kyle Mooney) and Alexanya Atoz (Kristen Wiig, who is unrecognizable). Meanwhile there are performers being killed like Justin Beiber. They all have one of Zoolanders classic looks when they die. Former swimsuit model now Interpol agent, Valentina Valencia (Penlope Cruz), gets Zoolander and Hansel to help her. This leads back to Mugatu (Will Ferrell), the villain from the first movie. With a number of references to the original, there are only handful of new laughs. The most enjoyable part is the many cameos, which are more than I can mention here. The movie as a whole isn't that great and could have been way better. Since they never moved away from the original, they only added a number of elements that don't pan out as the filmmakers would have hoped, like Zoolanders son. It was better than I thought it would be, and I found it entertaining. For fans of the original it is worth checking out but don't hope for much. Its best to turn your brain off like like the dumb lead characters, Zoolander and Hansel, and sit back with a drink in your hand. If you don't enjoy the movie at least you had that drink.",1468454400,,1752,4.766447368421052

I was looking forward to that simpleton innocence/plain old stupidity of Derek Zoolander and the clueless around him, but with Zoolander No. 2, I found the plot to be so beyond stupid that it just really was a shame.  Some of the story would have been so hilarious but there were so many tangents that were all based on sexual subplots that it lost some of the craziness of the original film and just went right into unsurprisingly gratuitous sex to buoy up a weak story.

I tell you, I was disappointed not to see more of the Alexanya Atos character;  she stole every scene she was in and if expanded on, would have have everyone rolling in laughter.  Between her accent and Derek's oblivious approach to everything, it was a real missed opportunity.

I watched it all the way through but found myself bored in most of the story and disappointed.  So I went back and watched the original Zoolander and all was right with the world once again.",1467417600,,1078,4.469387755102041

They did these things in the first movie.  There's plenty of cameos in this one too, from Willy Nelson, Ariana Grande, Kiefer Sutherland, a lot of fun is just seeing who pops up on the screen next.

This was a fun movie, sure it was predictable but so what?  It was obvious the actors were all having a lot of fun making this, I imagine as soon as cut was yelled, a lot of laughter erupted on the set while filming most scenes.

Without giving away any spoilers, this is the kind of movie where the preview/trailer shows you the best parts of the movie.  If you've already seen the preview or trailer, you won't miss much by watching this movie.  The movie is supposed to be purposely stupid to be funny - I love that, but the plot of this movie is needlessly convoluted.  There are also very long stretches of boredom - just nothing interesting or funny going on.  And I am sorry to say that Ben Stiller, much like his character has much less charm on this second spin.

It has its funny moments, but you get those in the trailer!  The rest of this movie is just dull.

I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I just couldn't.  This movie had great potential, but it fizzled.  I actually apologized to my family for making them sit through watching this movie.

If anything good came out of buying this Blu Ray disc was that it included a bonus UltraViolet code for the first movie.  I really enjoyed the original, so that was a nice bonus.",1466294400,,1285,4.295833333333333

7552717,2,B018IDVB6W,"not as funny as the original, because the male models were not competing like they did in the first film with the split screens and long music video sequences.  the cameos were too fast/short to enjoy.  the ending should have shown the actual ball, with some model competition, followed by the final fight, then it would have been better.  also, the cool evil dj, never mixed a set?  possibly a bad editor here.",1465344000,4,411,4.589041095890411

7552721,2,B018IDVB6W,"This movie hardly made me laugh, only a few parts made me chuckle but that's it. The jokes are weak we've seen them all before. Also too many celebrity cameos it was just dumb. Also milla Jovovich's character should of had been in the movie instead of Kristin Wigg's character. Milla Jovovich out performs Wigg. Milla is a natural when it comes to comedy her small part at the end made me burst out laughing, that was the only time this movie made me do that. It's ok I guess just rent it the first is way superior also Will Ferrel did a great job as well.",1465257600,,556,4.205607476635514

7552759,1,B018IDVB6W,I hate racim and bigots and that's all there is in this movie!  I wish Ben tiller and his white friends would go away and stop practicing thei r bigotry. Doesn t Ben Stiller know that his parents were murdered in Auchwits so we woudlnt have to live like this anymore. They should know beter than to be racist and bigots! Stop Trans bigotry! I am a social justice wrarior and i won't stop til i don't ahve to see anything from white people anymore (i am white). I hate their music and movies!!!!1 Except for when white do thigns i understand like degrade and humiliate themselves.

7552772,2,B018IDVB6W,"I loved the first movie. This one was a huge disappointment. They went way overboard with the sex humor. It was way too much and not even funny, just gross.

Watching the previews, you think that Will Ferrell plays more of a prominent role in the movie, but he doesn't even make an appearance until much later on. Who wrote this movie anyway?  it has no flow and makes no sense.",1465257600,2,356,4.115942028985507

I understand that the humor is supposed to be ""silly"", but even then there needs to be at least SOME sort of essence to the jokes... if you're the type of person that can laugh hysterically for 10 minutes when someone says the word poop, you MIGHT be able to find some humor in this movie, but for the average person it's just too... empty. The story itself is uninteresting, the humor is... not there, and the acting is horrible (I believe it's SUPPOSED to be, but none of the actors pushed the envelope enough on that for it to be effective).",1525478400,,609,4.398230088495575
8742403,5,B018IDVB6W,"This is very clearly intended to be silly. Don't take it seriously at all, this isn't a movie to show off your pretentious sensibilities. (If you're looking for that, maybe try an indie drama.) This is a movie to put on after a hard day when you just need to relax to something ridiculous. I've watched it for this purpose many times, as well as to help me sleep. The plot isn't detailed and in depth, it's simply a movie which the cast obviously made just to entertain themselves and others. Fun. Watch it, have it, enjoy it. This movie is a reminder that life is too short to bother being a lame, always frowning person who needs everything to be serious and make sense.",1525132800,,672,4.384

I think people forgot there was a gasoline fight in the first one.  Anyway, it was as funny as I hoped it would be. I laughed out loud more than once. The cameo's were funny but I am sad there was no David Bowie. If you enjoyed the first one, you will enjoy this one.",1524268800,,385,4.093333333333334
