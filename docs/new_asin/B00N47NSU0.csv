8676152,4,B00N47NSU0,"""Skylark"" is an amusing lightweight  comedy  of a marriage in crisis with  Claudette Colbert { Lydia Kenyon} married to Ray Milland { Tony Kenyon} who after five  {5} years of matrimony is more interested in making money thru his advertising business than anything else. When  Lydia finds out that Tony was too busy to buy her 5th wedding anniversary gift - designating his best friend attorney Geoge  Gore {Walter Abel }  to buy her gift  off a piece of expensive jewelery.  She is furious  and feeling neglected and unwanted { and with design and calculation} flirts with Jim Blake {  Brian Aherne} Tony's lawyer  who without any scruples  then ""puts the moves"" on her.  She agrees  to marry  him after a "" quicki  "" Reno""  divorce. Plot complications follow  with Tony belattedly realizing that he wants to save  his marriage. The film is greatly enhanced by a predatory Binnie Barnes {Mytle Vantine} as a calculating clients wife who has designs on Tony,  Walter Abel  {George Gore } as  Tony's all knowing /  buddy ""cracking wise""  and Grant Mitchell {Frederick Vantine} is in his usual role as an exasperated long  suffering husband.  There are two [2} bravera  comedic  sequences- Lydia and  Tony in  a fully loaded NYC subway car riding with every sterotype of a  New York City resident and accent imaginable - all chiming in to Lydia and  Tony's argument  /  conversation  AND an ill fated sailboat  jaunt  with Lydia and Jim tossed about in a storm with Lydia  {improbably} trying to cook a fish in  a tiny galley with predictable hiiarious and disastorous results. Director Mark Sandrich competently moves the narrative along  and Charles Lang, a  top flight cinematogapher provides his typical shimmering soft focused  photography add greatly to the film.  Miss Colbert never looked better and Ray Milland is his  usual smooth, well groomed  and supercillious self.  This  a nice film ,well acted with attractive performers, amusing screenplay and a  stylish production and I give it a 4 1/2 star rating - Recommended.",1429401600,4,2030,4.916417910447761

8676154,3,B00N47NSU0,I loved Claudette Colbert and Ray Milland together in The Gilded Lily.  I was disappointed in Skylark.  I don't think it was one of Ms. Colbert's best pictures.,1415404800,4,160,4.678571428571429
