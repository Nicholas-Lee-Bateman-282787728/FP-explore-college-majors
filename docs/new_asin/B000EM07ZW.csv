8111088,5,B000EM07ZW,I have three videos in the Yoga Booty Ballet series.  This one is on top of the list.  I really love the instructors - they are really good at keeping the exercise interesting and they are very personable and really help you keep motivated throughout the video.  The setting is outdoors - which really pulls me in and motivates me to exercise.,1374796800,,343,4.5
8111089,5,B000EM07ZW,I wish this could be incorporated into Weight Watchers so I would know how many points I burn.  SO MUCH FUN you won't believe you are working out!!!!!,1359072000,,150,4.357142857142857
8111090,3,B000EM07ZW,"I don't like that they have no options other than buying the 'YBB Squishy Ball' for like the entire ab workout. I'm not sure I like either of the instructors either. But the guy on drums was great, haha.",1358726400,,203,4.230769230769231
8111091,5,B000EM07ZW,"I love these gals so much and have to give them another 5 star review. I can always rely on them to motivate me and get me going, and I often need such motivation to workout. I read that they both have been studying yoga for sometime and their voice in combo with the drums really relaxes me. And they are just total sweethearts! The core work was a bit different and kept things interesting as well. I think that after so many years of standard workout videos that we are all reaching to find something a bit different and in search of more creative ways to exercise. These girls provide us with such workouts. Thanks and keep making more videos please!",1335571200,,654,4.368852459016393
8111092,5,B000EM07ZW,"I've had this DVD before when it first came out with the set. Unfortunately my toddler got into the dvd's and scratched them. :( So I've purchased this again after taking a break from it for almost 4 years. Nothing wrong with it, just life happens. The reason I've gone back to this is because I have been guaranteed every single time a great ab workout as well as a great stretching/yoga routine that is incredibly satisfying in the sculpting segment. I would suggest doing the sculpting without the weights for the first time around so you can get used to the choreography and make sure you have your form right. After that, I would start off with 5lb handweights. I've only been able to go up to 8lbs when I did this years ago, so we'll see how I do this time. It is a lot of fun if you like to dance. The instructors are fun, as well as very relaxing when it comes to meditation/yoga time. One of the only instructors who can actually help me keep my mind from being distracted. I'm ADHD so that is quite an accomplishment. I have always felt more flexible, stronger and more balanced when I do these workouts. Now I'm just trying to include this into my daily routine of going to the gym. Definitely worth buying. Keep doing it for 6-8 weeks. You won't be dissapointed.",1300147200,5,1274,4.379746835443038
8111093,5,B000EM07ZW,"This is 2 separate menu choices for the sculpt or the abs & core strength. This is the usual great positive affirmation reminders, relaxed, body awareness you get with Teigh & Gillian.

Sculpt:
Intro & mudra/meditation - 3 min - Teigh & Gillian alone like the original video set w/Ravi by a pond
Toning/Weights - 22 min - Teigh, Gillian, 3 other girls & a guy at that amphitheater looking beautiful structure like the original set in coral starting with a curtsy to warm up the legs/knees or squats for those with bad knees, step touches w/hand weights in different positions to works arms as well as plies/horse stances up/down & squats, lunges.. all while having hand weights. Ends with some good simple arm stretches & leg stretches for a couple of min & ends with short mudra.
Yoga - 24 min - starts with mudra, then breath of fire with arms up,  kundalini yoga w/torso twists with arms out, then hatha yoga cat/cow stretching, then goes into a sorta vinyasa flowing yoga routine w/o sun salutations, starting with downward dogs, side stretches, mountain, lunges, jump switching legs which was much more fun then I'd thought, chair, pelvic tucks w/chair, standing fwd bends, plank, some push ups, warrior 1 & 2, revolved/backward warrior 1 for great stretching, upward dog, in/out several times side angle to work on core & not rely on hands for body weight, raised leg downward dogs, half moon & in between harder moves would be resting with child's pose, downward dogs or downward dogs w/standing fwd bends & mountain w/slight back bends.
Ending Mudra/meditation - 3 min - Teigh & Gillian by the pond again.

The yoga alone made it worth it to me. Those who are new to yoga will have trouble following since there is not enough instruction, so I suggest this only for those who already have done yoga classes at a gym and/or own several beginner yoga dvds & know the poses mentioned above. The music was good, kept me going, a good world beat music. I knew it had sculpting w/hand weights, but I did it, though hand weight normal fitness repetition bores me & never buy it. With Teigh & Gillian, I did do it because it was them so it wasn't as horrible as the usual fitness dvds.

Abs & Core Strength:
Intro & mudra/meditation - 3 min - Teigh & Gillian alone like the original video set w/Ravi by a koi pond again.
Part 1 - 12 min - Teigh & Gillian alone by the pond/beautiful large backyard grassy area.  The usual ab work starting with lying ab spinal twists, bended knee easy circles, yoga bridge, crunches, thigh squeezing with squishy ball, both crunch & squeeze ball same time, bicycle, lower pelvis/leg lifts, crunches w/bent knees to chest same time (hard!), crunches with legs down with bottom's of feet touching & bridge again.
Part 2 - 13 min -  grassy hill/mountain/shy background, Ravi on drums, Andy (who was in original set) with Teigh & Gillian. Start with on stomach & lifting up upper torso only to work back, then just legs to work glutes & back, then just opposite arm to leg & then other side, then finally full locust lifting both upper torso & legs at same time. Rest in child's, then cat/cow stretching, then  dolphin which is like yoga plank on elbows/forearms on ground to work abs, legs & back to hold position, cobra, dolphin again with single leg lifts, cobra, side plank modified to be on one elbow but still hard to do working on obliques, legs & upper arm balance strength, roll ups & downs,  core twists - yoga lying down spinal twists bent knees to each side w/o letting them to ground to work abs, pilates bicycle, core twist again, pilates bicycle, cobra & end in child's pose.
Part 3 -  min - same place as above w/Andy again, roll ups & downs w/VERY exaggerated LOUD breathing in/out so you can hear when to exhale & inhale... which is good, but ok TOO LOUD & was annoying. next is legs up squeezing ball between thighs w/crunches, leg/pelvic lifts, crunches w/legs to chest same time (hard!), holding ball in hands, put ball over head then to knees which require a little crunch, pilates bicycle w/o arm or upper body work, legs open/close to work inner/outer legs & use ball for arms for fun, popping upper torso to straight raised legs in air & ends w/cobra & child's pose.
Mudra/mediation - 2 min - end w/Teigh & Gillian at pond again for ending mudra.

I liked part 2 best, though they tried to change up the crunch work, I did get bored with it a little, but if it had been anyone besides Teigh & Gillian, I would have turned it off. The music was more muted in this, mostly only percussion, but a good, fast beat... like african or latin style fast.",1193184000,14,4600,4.544685990338165
