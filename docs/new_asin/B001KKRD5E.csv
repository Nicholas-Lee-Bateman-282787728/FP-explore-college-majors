8315098,1,B001KKRD5E,"I had read BOTH reviews on this DVD. I love Amy Winehouse and wanted it anyways. Anything on Amy is worth buying, watching, listening to or reading. Well...almost everything.

This DVD is the second copy I had purchased through Amazon. The first copy I thought was defective. At least 5 or 6 areas showing photos of Amy flickered. I looked at the back of the disc and there is a uneven circle around the DVD hole. So I sent it back thinking it was scratched.

I finally received another copy and before I played it it had the same circular scratch around the DVD hole. I put it in and watched this disc again. Same flickering photos, same poor production , same bad biography with very irritating computer graphics or ""light show"" graphics continuously playing over and over again in the background.

Same photos, same concert clips( without any audio...which is listed on case )same video clips are played over again and again. Not even centered in center of screen. They flip to the right then to the left.

This seems like a project from a computer school that maybe won some sort of contest and the prize was that they would release it on DVD.

This is just plain BAD, hard to watch..almost like a Amy Winehouse bio for a kindergarten class. I was waiting to be quizzed after this finally ended.

I was shocked Amazon sold this. I guess they cannot preview every item they sell but if they did this would not be welcome to be linked with any quality web site.

I am keeping this copy just as an Amy Winehouse fanatic would do. I read the 2 reviews on Amazon warning fans not to buy this but...I did so I cannot blame Amazon to send back for another refund.

When will Amy's record company release something other than the Live in London DVD.

Video compilation? TV Appearances? More Concerts?

This DVD is never going to be ""justified"" in any sense of the word.",1234483200,11,1865,4.491124260355029
8315099,1,B001KKRD5E,I love my little Amy Winehouse.  I'm a sucker for anything with her name on it.  I want you to benefit from my experience.  Don't waste your time or money on this DVD.  I actually put it in the trash.  Very bad voice over- set to photos.  No recent or new information.,1233878400,17,268,4.0576923076923075
8315100,1,B001KKRD5E,"I purchased this DVD with low expectations. Shockingly, even those low expectations were beaten hands-down by what I saw. I'm a huge Amy Winehouse fan, and have various collections of TV shows, concerts, etc. This was by far the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. All it consists of are a few photos of Amy (no 'live' footage whatsoever) with a cheesy voice over droning on about irrelevant things to fill up the time. This is NOT a documentary by any stretch of the imagination. There is no film of Amy, no video excerpts, no concert footage, no interviews with anyone - nothing. Go check out youtube - someone will definitely have done a better job than whoever created this.",1233619200,13,684,4.614754098360656
