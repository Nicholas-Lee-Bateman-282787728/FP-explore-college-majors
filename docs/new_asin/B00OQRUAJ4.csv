6759347,5,B00OQRUAJ4,Love this little guy. If I could give this cartoon more stars I would. Good cartoon for the kids as well.,1426291200,2,105,4.0476190476190474
6759348,2,B00OQRUAJ4,"Cartoon Network you stingy fools. Why can't we just get something of real value? You short changed Flapjack, Chowder, Adventure Time, Regular Show, and now Clarence. You get a critically acclaimed show on your channel, and you can't help but nickel and dime the consumer. I guess if you can have people pay for incomplete compilations at 10$ over and over, why would you stop? I think adventure time has had 10 random collections come out and regular show is a few short of that as well. Just random episodes often duplicated on each release.

This release is about 1/3 of season 1, with practically no special features (no commentary, behind the scenes, storyboards, interviews, deleted scenes, etc). you do get the pilot episode, which is ok I guess. So they expect you to buy at least two more dvd sets to complete season one, easily totaling 30$. Now that is insane considering this is for a standard definition release. Maybe if this was a blu ray we would have something to talk about, but it is a friggin DVD.

Then once you buy all three, they will release a proper season release with the features you wanted on this dvd. Just keep on gobbling up our money CN. You deserve it.

Just as a side note, I wouldn't be surprised if there are no super special features on future releases because the show creator and voice of Clarnece (Skylar Page) was let go from the show back in July 2014. Good luck getting creator commentary or any decent interviews with him gone. Also, supposedly one of the shows writers will be voicing Clarence in season 2 (Spencer Rothbell), so that should be interesting (?awful?).",1425513600,18,1611,4.6456140350877195

6759351,5,B00OQRUAJ4,"As a parent of a little six year old boy I can tell you I love and appreciate Clarence.  A very silly cartoon that is non violent and sends a message to be friendly and accepting of all people.  Clarence is a very friendly fun loving boy, who reaches out to everyone and wants to be their friend.  Yes he is goofy and silly and even a little off putting at times, but isn't that a little bit of every little boy you have met or raised?  I like the fact that the cartoon is not trendy, nor is it violent like so many today.  My son love Clarence and laughs continually at his antics.",1424131200,12,582,4.026086956521739

6759353,5,B00OQRUAJ4,Besides Winnie the Pooh and Rio I LOVE Clarence!!! The only thing about this show is the rating. I can see nothing TV-PG in this but I see more of a TV-Y rating. C'mon Cartoon Network! Not all of your shows have PG rated material! The other problem is with SpongeBob SquarePants and how they changed the rating from TV-Y to TV-Y7.,1420243200,,330,4.338709677419355

6759370,4,B00OQRUAJ4,"Clarence is a pretty cool kid.  He enjoys life to the fullest and makes friends practically everywhere he goes.  In short, he's my kind of guy.  He takes a positive spin on every day through the town of Aberdale in 12 episodes in this premiere volume like:

""Fun Dungeon Face-Off"" - At Rough Riders Chicken, Clarence sneaks off with his friend Jeff's french fries and into the play area where a cat-and-mouse kind of situation begins.
""Pretty Great Day with a Girl"" - Clarence spends the afternoon exploring with a girl his age unaware of other kids suspiciously following them.
""Lost in the Supermarket"" - When Clarence loses his mom's coupons, he and his friend Sumo go on a mission through the store to get them back.
""Clarence's Millions"" - Clarence makes up ""Clarence Dollars"" and it becomes a hit to his schoolmates.  But then the other kids go too far.
""Rise 'n Shine"" - Clarence gets up early and takes part in all kinds of high jinks before the sun rises.
""Slumber Party"" - Clarence picks up an invitation to a slumber party, but it didn't turn out to what he expected.
""Too Gross for Comfort"" - Clarence invites a girl to a ""guys only"" tree house and the other boys try their best to make up gross-out stories to drive her away.

Also on this DVD is the original pilot episode of this series that you don't want to miss.

So join your chubby buddy Clarence and all of his friends in new episodes on Cartoon Network on TV and possibly a brand-new comic book series, too !",1431388800,,1480,4.45925925925926

6759374,5,B00OQRUAJ4,"I am 61 years old. I live with 2 daughters and a 7 year old granddaughter, One daughter is an RN, soon to be a NP. We all love Clarence. There is something about him...as well as all of the characters that make the program so endearing. I cannot really explain it, just that every person we have convinced to sit through 3 episodes,feels the same way. We were so worried when the creator was fired that the show would end. Needless to say, all is well, now.
