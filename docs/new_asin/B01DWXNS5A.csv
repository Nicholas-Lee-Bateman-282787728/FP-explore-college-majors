8757036,5,B01DWXNS5A,"Daniel Guret (Ange Dargent) is already 14, but he hasn't quite made it through puberty. A slender boy with a small frame, fine features, a long mop of a hairdo, and a falsetto voice, the hero of Microbe & Gasoline, from French director Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), is often mistaken for a girl.

Nicknamed Microbe by his schoolmates, he carries around a lot of shame. He seems to have few friends, and while he fantasizes incessantly about his classmate Laura (Diane Besnier), he's too afraid to ask her out.

Daniel's life changes when he befriends transfer student Tho (Thophile Baquet), a supremely confident nonconformist from a poor family. A gifted mechanic who helps his dad fix engines before school, he shrugs off bullies who taunt him for smelling like gasoline.

Outsiders both, Daniel and Tho are prototypical Gondry heroes. But here the indie auteur forgoes his visual pyrotechnics and experimental narrative style to tell a straightforward and delightful coming-of-age yarn.

The first half is a deftly drawn character study that looks at the two schoolboys' relationships with their families and peers. They bond over their mutual hatred for bourgeois life in the small city of Versailles (""We can't blossom,"" Tho complains). Dreaming of escape, they spend their free time building a motor home from scratch.

Once summer vacation starts, they run away, with grand plans of taking a road trip across France in their monstrous creation - it's kind of a ramshackle toolshed on wheels powered by a lawn mower engine.

They have great adventures: They're taken in by a creepy dentist who insists on fixing their smiles, and they get into a violent confrontation with a French-Korean street gang.

Dargent and Baquet are terrific, delivering incredibly relaxed performances as two kids with exceptional intelligence and a burning passion for life. And it's clear they're still kids. Filled with misconceptions about life, about sex, and about adulthood, they spend hours giving each other absurd dating advice.

A cross between Franois Truffaut's sometimes-harrowing dramas about childhood and a Steven Spielberg fantasy, Gondry's film abounds with sentiment - without falling prey to sentimentality.",1468540800,,2236,5.27887323943662
8757037,5,B01DWXNS5A,"What a great choice for a group of French students from Seattle Academy as their first exposure to the 2016 Seattle International Film Festival. ""Microbe et Gasoil"" (English captions) is writer/director Michael Gondry's latest, most charming French entry about two teenage misfits who are too clever to fit in.

If you have followed Gondry's career, you already know cinema is his playground. ""Mood Indigo,"" ""Be Kind Rewind,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Soul,"" are just a few of his inimitable films. This latest one had much less whimsy and far more heart!

Once again he has assembled a terrific cast for his heartfelt examination of friendship.

His cast:
  * Ange Dargent is Daniel, an undersized teenager nicknamed ""Microbe."" He is an artist and of course he is misunderstood, overlooked and teased.
  * Theophile Baquet plays Theo, the audacious newcomer who is smart, inventive, resourceful (and misunderstood!). This handsome charmer can build all sorts of things out of scrap, including the perfect use for a two-stroke gasoline engine, hence his nickname, ""Gasoil.""
  * Douglas Brosset is Oscar, his older brother, who unexpectedly loans Daniel his GPS. (Watch what happens to THAT!)
  * Audrey Tautou is Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, his depressed mother.
  * Diane Besnier brings us Laura, the lovely girl of Daniel's dreams.

This wonderful film captures perfectly an adolescent boy's need for adventure and excitement. Our two young heroes decide to take off for the summer in a homemade house on wheels. They tell each other ghost stories, engage in philosophical arguments, and flirt with disaster more than once. Watch two cops take a selfie beside that geranium-bedecked window. And see how Daniel gets a Samurai haircut in a Korean whorehouse... Yeah, that's what I said!

This one is satisfying on so many levels I won't try to list them. This is R-rated because it is European, with a little different sensibility from what we construe as acceptable for our American teenagers. More's the pity... I loved it!",1466726400,,2034,5.196319018404908
