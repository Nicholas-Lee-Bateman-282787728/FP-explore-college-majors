It's a must see for anyone who remembers this scourge, or any historian.",1200700800,7,321,4.8545454545454545
7909574,5,B00000I4W0,"I viewed this film at home and then showed it to my high school chemistry students during a unit on water-borne disease.  The students found it quite moving and there was much ""sniffling"" and wiping of eyes during  scenes where children were shown suffering in the iron lungs.  An excellent  film for any biology or social science class to show the students the human  side of a disease.",942969600,29,387,4.632352941176471
