8550289,4,B00ADULAHE,"Briefly: This is an excellent film. Funny, very ethnic Italian mafioso depictions, life on the street in Greenwich Village in the early 1980s, lots of early 80's clothing, essentially a drama/comedy/thriller with emphasis on character development of the two main characters. Acting is very good, with a bit of over-the-top acting by Eric Roberts, who plays kind of a dumb/uneducated guy who is always on the lookout for a scheme to get money (even if it's not legal). Mickey Rourke plays a smarter guy who is attempting to plan for his future. But, he is connected at the hip to his idiot cousin (Eric Roberts). They steal money from the mafia using Robert's plan, but Roberts never told his cousin that it was mafia money they were stealing. Bad things ensue, as you can imagine. Good plot, very entertaining.",1497571200,,810,4.83453237410072
