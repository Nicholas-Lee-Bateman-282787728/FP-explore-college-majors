8668791,4,B00LXDQ7IM,"Full disclosure:  I love zombie movies.  There are no bad zombie movies, just some better than others (with the possible exception of Bigfoot vs Zombies).  Its the usual plot, people trying to survive, both the zombies and each other.  Theres a wide enough range of characters that one may empathize with at least one, and despise some of the others.  The title implies a gang association, which is actually filled by punk gangsta wannabes.  For anyone less than a devotee, a rental is more in order than a purchase.",1527465600,,516,4.741573033707865
8668792,3,B00LXDQ7IM,"This is a very confusing film at first. It was 28 minutes in and I still didn't know who the main cast members were. One way to introduce a zombie film is to show a scene or two when a person or two first encounters a zombie followed by their fear and response. In this case the director took the idea and decided to run with it resulting in the first half hour of a 90 minute film being an endless succession of these kinds of scenes where you meet a character who then meets a zombie or two and dies. Although one or two of these characters turn out to be central characters who live a while, you don't know that until the film is almost half over.

Once things finally get going you get an OK low-budget zombie film with the usual group coming together during a zombie apocalypse, this time in the outskirts of Nottingham and in Sherwood Forest (yes, Robin Hood's hangout) trying to decide what to do. The film has all the usual problems of low budget zombie films: weak acting, a muddled script, zombies that are sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and inexplicable actions by the characters. The movie is shot on video as many of these low-budget things are but aside from choppy editing the overall look is good. The biggest complaint is that almost nothing actually happens and it's just a bunch of people running back and forth. This is true, but I felt this wsa a plus for the film because this is pretty much what actual people would do rather than come up with some grand master plan.

If you like zombie movies it's OK, no better or worse than many. But others shouldn't bother with it.",1453593600,,1597,4.373737373737374
