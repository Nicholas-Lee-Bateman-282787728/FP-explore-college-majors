8193847,5,B000PY52JA,"I bought this workout book when I wanted to get a little more fit before my wedding.
It has great illustrations of the exercises and has a variety of workouts.
This book is not just for wedding prep--it is a great workout for anyone.  I refer to it from time to time to remember certain exercises or to get ideas for workouts.  It's a book worth keeping after the wedding is over, so I would recommend it as a gift (for a bride who is interested in working out--we don't want to be offensive). :)",1310601600,,496,4.2105263157894735
8193848,1,B000PY52JA,"I took a chance in buying this workout dvd. It didn't have any reviews, which I don't let reviews persuade me to buy or not buy a workout dvd, but I do not like certains things in workout dvds and if this one had reviews and my dislike(s) were mentioned in a review(s), then I wouldn't have bought the dvd.

Before, taking a chance on this dvd, I've gone on youtube to search for a clip of the workout, but none was there. I've searched the internet for a clip and nothing came up, so I've gone ahead and took a chance on this dvd. If I knew it was going to be a homemade dvd, I wouldn't have wasted my money. Thank goodness, the third party seller was selling the dvd for 1 cents and I've paid $2.99 for the dvd.

The workout is filmed in someone's house. Maybe's the instructor's house. I have some workout dvds that are filmed on a living room stage, but they look professional. The instructors are well known instructors.

If this workout is not filmed in a house, then the stage was made to really look like someone's house. There's wood floor like you would see in someone's house. There's a piano on the back wall with a picture that reads piano above it and another picture above it as well. To it's right, there's a bookcase that's housing books and dvds and a few inches away from, there is a chair against the wall with a picture above it and between the chair and bookcase, you can see a plug socket.

There are three ladies in this video. The instructor and two of her friends. They look like they are making an audition video for a workout dvd. Whomever is behind the filming of this video does a horrible job. The instructor can be talking and you will see a sideview of her. There are shots, where you will only see her and her friend to her back right. Sometimes the camera will focus on either of the ladies in the back. One of the ladies in the has too much makeup on and sometimes, she looks like she tired of exercising and because the instructor doesn't cue well and can go fast, she gotten lost. The other lady, if I am not mistaken, her name is Candy. She acts goofy, which, I can see a person acting goofy in their home working out to exercise videos. In my opinion, there's nothing wrong for a person to have a little fun at their house, but not in a workout dvd. The woman even likes to flirt with the camera.

The camera person makes sure the back up ladies wear that fake smile on their face. I guess he or she was doing something to get their attention, because, when they stop smiling, you can see them look at the camera and start smiling again.

The dvd is broken down into three section.

1. Brief warmup
2. Aerobics
3. Toning
4. Abs
5. No cool down

The dvd is 30 minutes. In my opinion, they could saved money producing this dvd.",1286323200,2,2765,4.223484848484849
