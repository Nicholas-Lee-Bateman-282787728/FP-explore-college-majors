8476843,4,B002MAYULQ,"The version of this film I purchased had no english subtitles, which was a surprise to me since cast member Haifa Wehbe has a substantial international following.  Needless to say, my ignorance of Arabic left me quite lost as to plot, but I got the main points.  The film starts out with a series of news events involving the Middle East which I found peculiarly out of place in a story about a man inheriting his family vegetable stand.  But as the movie progresses I began to see its relevance.  Male aggression takes a front seat as various characters engage in conflict throughout the film.  Man's inhumanity to man played out in many scenes and the story showed us unflinchingly the treatment of women among some males in this society.  Our protagonist, however, is a multi-faceted fellow who falls in love with a lovely woman played by Haifa, whose self-consciousness disappears as she tackles scenes of abuse, a few attempts at suicide and an assault that basically amounts to rape.  Haifa Wehbe is a darn good actress.  We follow the main character's trials and tribulations...so many tribulations...as we make our way through this dark and rather hopeless film.

The movie made me angry and didn't help me get rid of my preconceived notions about some Middle Eastern males - sorry guys, but really, dragging women by the hair went out with cave drawings.  The acting was good - I hated the bad guys and loved the good guys, and Haifa, besides the belly dancing scene, which is worth the price of the film, is a gem.",1298851200,,1524,4.695488721804511
