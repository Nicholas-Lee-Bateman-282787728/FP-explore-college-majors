8350707,2,B0024NL8XY,"This is a great source of shuttle launch footage for my 2 1/2 year old.  Way better than watching single clips from youtube.  The soundtrack, however, is asinine.  It's like some guy with a drum kit, a cheap guitar and Garageband software pounded out a deathmetal riff that really has nothing to do with the space shuttle.  Maybe it's supposed to convey the ""power"" of a rocket launch, but it really sucks.",1261094400,,406,4.597222222222222
8350708,3,B0024NL8XY,"This dvd was definitely not what I had expected.  I somehow thought it might be a documentary.  It was more of a music video.  There was no narration at all.  The music was ok, but it was kinda cheesy, basically late 80s early 90s rock...no credits given.  The footage was really good, and the cutting was good I thought, it was mostly interesting.  The only thing was that the series of every single launch since STS-114 got a bit tedious.  I actually fell asleep for part of it.  Not really intellectual stuff, but great footage nonetheless. I just wish it had been more informative. Really only good for space dorks like me, other people probably won't get through the whole thing.",1247702400,3,684,4.595041322314049
