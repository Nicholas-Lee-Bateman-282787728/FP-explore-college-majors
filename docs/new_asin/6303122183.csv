It's about an american boy who's parents die so he has to move to scotland with his widowed grandfather. He is very lonely so he wishes for a friend and then he meets a dragon whom he names Yowler. They become best friends. Then they grow up and a developer and his daugher come to scotland. The boy, John, falls in love with the daughter and consents to send Yowler to a ""better place,"" a park called Dragonworld. But Yowler is mistreated so John and the girl, beth set out to save Yowler. THis movie is great! I would recommend it for all ages.",986601600,13,640,4.169354838709677

572847,5,6303122183,"This movie is an excellent one for the younger viewers who are fascinated with dragons. Does not scare the young children but keeps the older ones attention. Teaches a few good life lessons,while being very entertaining. I  would recomend it for ages 3 on up to adults.",937008000,6,269,4.723404255319149

7839170,5,6303122183,"This is my all-time favorite Moonbeam film.  I remember really looking forward to it, more so than any other of Moonbeam's films.  I can't remember why, I guess it just looked more epic.  I loved it so much when I rented it that I was willing to watch it again on Nickelodeon when they aired it on their Sunday afternoon movie spot (besides getting to see one of my favorite movies again it meant that I could pick something else to rent in its place).  And now I can enjoy it anytime I want.  I've been looking through thrift stores for a copy of this for years, and was surprised how hard it was to find online for under $5 until just recently.  Perhaps the most amazing thing of all is how well it stood the test of time for me.  I found it to be a very enjoyable film, with good acting & special effects.  In the Moonbeam Video Zone segment they said that this movie was tough to make, but if you ask me it was worth the effort because it really shows.  Now if I could only get me a VHS of Magic Island at a good price, my collection of favorite Moonbeam family movies would be complete.  I have a copy recorded off the Disney Channel, but it's missing the credits & besides that the VHS tape would have a behind the scenes look at the end.",1385683200,,1244,4.124481327800829

7839172,5,6303122183,"This is a must see movie. It is an excellent story and has become a mini-cult classic for the few of us that saw it as kids. Unfortuantely, this movie is not getting passed on to a new generation as Paramount has yet to transfer it to DVD or Blueray. Kind of sad really when you see some of the tragedies that get transferred instead of forgotten.",1320969600,,347,4.1940298507462686
