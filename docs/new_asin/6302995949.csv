532824,4,6302995949,"OF HUMAN HEARTS was Jimmy Stewart's first major piece of Americana, his first serious foray into the nature of the American spirit.  This story of frontier life in a village on the banks of the Ohio River in the pre-Civil War era was a pet project of director Clarence Brown.  A whopping prize of $5,000 was awarded to a high school student in North Carolina named Ray Harris - he gave the film its title which was based on BENEFITS FORGOT authored by Honore Morrow and published 20 years previously.  Although there are definite cornball elements in the film, and its somewhat too slowly paced, the film stands up as a good evocation of the period in which it takes place.  Huston gives a remarkable performance as the zealous preacher and Bondi is great as his gentle soul of a wife.  The film was beneficial to Stewart's career; it was his first crack at a fully developed charactisation - and its success made it obvious that he was an actor with a definite future.",1006041600,14,969,4.545977011494253
532825,5,6302995949,"The first time I watched this wonderful movie, I was only 10 years old and even at that tender age it touched my heart. This moving story of a selfish young boy who learns the hard way the importance of gratitude, is one of  the lesser known classics, yet it has over the years become one of my  personal favorites.
Filmed in 1938 at the height of Hollywood's golden  age this Clarence Brown directed yarn contains a full measure of the  sentimental charm that so characterized the historical dramas that were  being produced at the time.
The story takes place shortly before the  Civil War and centers on the young son of a poor country preacher who  decides he wants to become a doctor much to his father's displeasure and  his mother's secret approval. From the very beginning he is shown to be an  ingrate, full of embarrassment and shame for the shabby living conditions  and tattered hand-me-down clothes grudgingly provided to the family by the  community in place of payment for his father's services as preacher. He is  forever getting his sweet mother played by the great Bullah Bondi to sell  off cherished family heirlooms to meet his selfish wants and with no  appreciation at all for the sacrifice. As the years pass and he grows into  manhood, the conflict between father and son becomes harsher by the day,  until finally the two come to blows which pushes the son to leave town and  pursue his dream of becoming a Doctor. He works his way through medical  school by cleaning the headmaster's apartment, and with the continued  sell-off of his mother's things but soon after entering medical school his  father becomes ill and dies. Now his poor mother is left all alone to fare  for herself with only the friendship of the town drunk to lean on for moral  support. As the Civil War escalates the young doctor is enlisted as an army  surgeon and after several years away at war without even as much as a  letter, his mother finally gives up hope and believes he has been killed in  battle. The scenes of her living with this heartbreak are sure to bring  tears. I won't spoil the outcome for you; it should be experienced to be  fully appreciated.
The incredible cast of this film including James  Stewart, Walter Huston, Bullah Bondi, Guy Kibbee and Sterling Holloway is  actually what makes the film work so well, they each fit their characters  seamlessly, from the main cast to the wonderful list of supporting  character actors. It is a classic story that you will cherish dearly.",959040000,38,2501,4.66743119266055

He made him sit right down and write to his Mother and told him, if he didn't write every week he would kick him out of him high ranking position.

532994,2,6302995949,"First of all, I adore Beulah Bondi! As an actress, she can do no wrong. Unfortunately, neither she nor a very young and earnest James Stewart NOR the always magnificent Walter Huston can save this ludicrously manipulative and sentimental film. It is pure schmaltz from beginning to end...and NOT the good kind. If you admire Miss Bondi, watch MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW again (or one of her other fine performances) and save yourself $18 and two hours you will never get back.",1430870400,,471,4.7560975609756095

533038,5,6302995949,"""Of Human Hearts"" is a 1938 Civil War drama starring Walter Huston, James Stewart, and Beulah Bondi with a great supporting cast that includes Charles Coburn, John Carradine, Sterling Holloway, Gene Lockhart, Ann Rutherford, and Guy Kibbee.

Walter Huston (1884-1950) plays a preacher, newly arrived in a small Ohio town in the years leading up to the Civil War. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Dodsworth"" (1936) and again in 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".

Jimmy Stewart (1908-97) is a film icon. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning once (""The Philadelphia Story"" in 1940). He had 2 BAFTA nominations (Anatomy of a Murder"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"") and 3 Golden Globe nominations including one win (""Hawkins"" in 1971). Twice he won the New York film critics award (""Anatomy of a Murder"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"") and he also gave us such memorable performances in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  Stewart plays Huston's son who wants to be a physician, much to Huston's chagrin. This is a rare role for Stewart who plays a self-absorbed young man who is far from sympathetic.

Beulah Bondi (1888-1981) was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film. She had been nominated previously for ""The Gorgeous Hussy"" (1936) and won an Emmy in 1977 for ""The Waltons"". She is best remembered for playing Granny in 1948s ""So Dear to My Heart"". Bondi plays Huston's wife and Stewart's mother. Bondi had the distinction of playing Stewart's mother in 4 other films including ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". She even reprised the role in 1971 for Stewart's TV show.

Guy Kibbee (1882-1956) had a round face and a jolly demeanor that helped him through more than 100 films between 1931 and 1948. He appeared in films like ""Babbitt"" (1934), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939). He plays a town leader.

Charles Coburn (1877-1961) appeared in more than 50 films, from 1933 through 1962. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won once (""The More the Merrier"" in 1943). I remember him best as ""Piggy"" in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" (1953). Coburn plays a small town doctor and a mentor to Stewart. BTW - this is one of the earliest film portrayals of a western physician who drinks too much.

John Carradine (1906-88) was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975). Carradine puts in a memorable cameo as Abraham Lincoln.

Scrawny Clem Bevans (1879-1963) played a grumpy old man in more than 100 films between 1935 and 1958. He made his first appearance at 55 in 1935 as a toothless old Doc Wiggins in ""Way Down East"" (1935). I remember him best in the uncharacteristic role of an ardent Nazi in Hitchcock's ""Saboteur"" (1942). In this film Bevans plays a town elder.

Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) plays a janitor at the medical school.  Lockhart appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for ""Algiers"" (won by Walter Brennan for ""Kentucky""). The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his roles as the judge in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938).

Sterling Holloway (1905-92) has a small role as Kibbee's son. Holloway is best remembered for his Disney roles (""The Jungle Book"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""The Aristocrats"").

Clarence Brown (1890-1987) produced and directed. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Flesh and the Devil""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director.

""Of Human Hearts"" provides a good look and feel to pioneer days in Ohio prior to the Civil War. Credit this to the camera work of Clyde De Vinna (1890-1953) who lensed more than 100 films between 1916 and 1948. He won the Oscar for ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928).

Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer. Stothart won the Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), and ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).

1938 was a pretty good year for films. The top grossing films were ""You Can't Take it With You"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", `Boys Town"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Sweethearts"", and ""Marie Antoinette"". The Oscars were to ""You Can't Take it With You"" (Picture, Director), ""Boys Town"" (Actor), and ""Jezebel"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""Algiers"", Cagney and O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", John Garfield's film debut in ""Four Daughters"" and Gable and Tracey in ""Test Pilot"".

The film is a real tear jerker. It's a character driven story about family life, conflicts, support, and unconditional love. Along with ""I Remember Mama"" this is one of those films you need to watch on Mother's Day. It's a heart-warming film with one of filmdom's most beloved mothers at her very best.",1305072000,4,5609,4.913319238900634

533041,5,6302995949,"Of Human Hearts is one of those poignant family dramas remembered fondly by older audiences but neglected by DVD marketers who shun religious themes.  It's a film that tells a story, rather than just a bunch of stuff that happens - a story about austere Reverend Ethan Wilkins, played perfectly by Walter Huston (Rain, Dodsworth, The Devil and Daniel Webster) who takes a position as the new preacher in Pine Hill Ohio, bringing his wife Mary, played by Beulah Bondi (On Borrowed Time, So Dear To My Heart) and young son Jason, portrayed as a boy by Gene Reynolds (who appeared in many movies as a boy, including In Old Chicago, Boys Town, and Love Finds Andy Hardy, and went on to direct many TV episodes including Leave It To Beaver, MASH, Lois and Clark - The New Adventures of Superman, and Touched By An Angel).

Ethan is humble but strict, emphasizing courtesy and generosity while denouncing pride and selfishness with stern discipline.  Jason is practical and wants to become a doctor.  His curiosity provokes his fathers wrath, and as he grows into a young man, later portrayed by James Stewart (It's A Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, etc.), he continues to defy him, at one point declaring ""I'd rather save bodies than souls any day!""  He runs away to medical school, often sending for money from his mother, who gradually sells her personal posessions to fund him, though he never returns to visit.

Civil War ensues, and Jason is one of the Union's best doctors, trying to save limbs rather than amputate whenever possible, though still neglecting his own parents.  He's finally shamed by the President himself, Abraham Lincoln, played excellently by John Carradine (The Grapes of Wrath, House of Frankenstein, Bluebeard, Peggy Sue Got Married, etc. etc. etc.).

This is still a great movie for the whole family, probably even more to the point in modern times, with relevant demonstrations of selfishness, pride, humility, courtesy, and transient material values.  It's one of the first and best of those poignant family classics like A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, I Remember Mama, Friendly Persuasion, etc., and a bit of a tear-jerker.

The terrific cast include a number of great character actors including Guy Kibbee (Little Lord Fauntleroy, Captain January), Charles Coburn (The Devil and Miss Jones, Kings Row), Ann Rutherford (Annie Laurie, Gone With The Wind, Andy Hardy series), Gene Lockhart (A Christmas Carol, That's The Spirit, Miracle On 34th Street, Going My Way, etc. etc.), Charley Grapwin (The Wizard of Oz, Grapes of Wrath, Ellery Queen series), Clem Bevens, Sterling Holloway (Remember the Night, Meet John Doe, Dumbo, Bambi, Peter and the Wolf, Winnie The Pooh, etc. etc.), Minor Watson, Ward Bond, and others.
