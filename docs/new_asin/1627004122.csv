7800528,5,1627004122,"This is such a great teaching DVD for working with the Muradi to accomplish your Kumihimo projects.  She goes into great detail on how to set up and work with your Muradi.  She even demo's how to accomplish some of the set up for both right and left handed persons.  I can't say enough about this DVD It is just like attending a class in person only you can pause when you need to accomplish a portion of what you just learned.  She also offers a lot of inside tips on handling things.  I also very, very strongly recommend the first DVD ""Learn Beaded Kumihimo on the Marudai.",1484524800,,576,4.296296296296297

MORE BEADED KUMIJIMO ON THE MARUDAI (DVD)

With Adrienne Gaskell
Kalmbach Publishing Company

I had been eagerly awaiting receipt of these two DVDs after I learned of their availability.  My experience was solely with making the  wonderful Kumihimo braids on the Marudai, but had never incorporated beads into their silky structures.  Now, I had no excuse for not determining the braid pattern, measuring out my cords, filling same with my favorite beads, wrapping the tama, adjusting the counter weight, and just following the wonderful visual and extremely well-articulated directions on these two DVDs.

 Adrienne Gaskell is a wonderful instructor.  She conducts workshops all over the country for people interested in learning all of the intricacies of this wonderful creative art happening.  The viewer is taught all of the steps to create these beautiful beaded woven cords on these two recently published DVDs.  If one cannot take a workshop with Adrienne, these DVDs provide a one-on-one experience of how to bead kumihimo.  We are taken through the planning stages regarding measuring and determining length of each cord for bead weaving necklaces and bracelets.  How long to cut cord?  She gives us a very definitive answer.  Can be particularly frustrating when necklace cord  ends up the wrong length.

We are instructed how to create several visual clues on the marudai to keep us on track and important information about documentation, winding tama, movement of hands across the mirror, threads, beads, counterweight, needles, etc.  DVDs also provides a lively discussion of the use of a bead spinning tool which is an indispensable aid for the kumihimo bead braider.

I would highly recommend both of these DVDs.  In fact my new RCA compact DVD player is just the right tool for them.
