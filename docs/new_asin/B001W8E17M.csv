8545138,5,B001W8E17M,"EWF never ceases to amaze me. They are the perfect band! This DVD shows you how it is supposed to be done! EWF is performing their many hits. Maurice is there and sounding as good as ever! Phillip is singing some amazing stuff! I call him the one and only because he sings some stuff that nobody else on this planet can do! The band is in rare form here playing all the great hits. Any true EWF fan will really enjoy this DVD! I know I did!
Call me and we can chat about it.
