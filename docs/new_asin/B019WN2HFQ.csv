7585263,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Excellent high-rep workout from Cathe.  By choosing heavier weights one can elevate the routine from intermediate level to advanced.  The wide range of premixes that include the bonuses offer different length workouts. Some of the Blizzard Blast moves are a bit higher impact, but generally this is a very well paced workout. Highly recommended.",1465948800,9,345,5.37037037037037
7585264,5,B019WN2HFQ,I have over a dozen workouts and just recently found Cathe. I just love her. Lots of premix options. She cues very well. Great intermediate/advanced routine.,1464998400,,157,5.076923076923077
7585265,5,B019WN2HFQ,One of my favorite Cathe workouts so far and I have quite a few.  This one is very versatile.  Love how it is split out to the different parts so you can mix and match as you like.  Very effective workout.,1464739200,2,205,3.951219512195122
7585266,4,B019WN2HFQ,"It is a very good workout but the music is meh. I do wish that the exercises would keep time with the beat of the music, because it would make it easier to follow along. Other than that, you will be sore and it definitely is a cardio workout as well.",1464393600,4,250,3.9215686274509802
7585267,5,B019WN2HFQ,Always love Cathe and this DVD is no exception. Excellent!,1461196800,,58,4.9
7585268,5,B019WN2HFQ,Amazing workout!!,1458777600,,17,8.0
7585269,5,B019WN2HFQ,"I was looking for DVDs focused on strength training and stumbled across Cathe Friedrich after doing some research.  This certainly fit the bill!  I'm an intermediate exerciser and found the main workout to be challenging but do-able (I did have to hit pause a few times).  Cathe hits every muscle group and does most exercises in combinations to maximize caloric burn and cardio effect.  After a 6 minute warm-up she takes off with a bang and only stops periodically to bring your heart rate down.  Sumo squats with bicep curls, lunges with rear flies, tricep extensions, shoulder presses, upward rows, regular rows, front raises, deadlifts and split stance deadlifts are some of the moves she performs.  Again, most lower body actions are done with an accompanying upper body exercise for efficiency.  She does just enough reps to fatigue the muscle groups before jumping into the next series of moves.  Considering that I already am feeling sore the rotation definitely works!

I'm pretty finicky when it comes to instructors (I have piles of DVDs gathering dust because I wasn't fond of the trainer) but I really like Cathe and her personality.  She's working hard along with you and although she doesn't offer a lot of guidance as far as modifications go if you listen to your body you'll know what amount of weight you can handle and what you can't.  Proper form (i.e. neutral spine) doesn't receive much attention so be sure to keep that in the back of your mind.

The DVD includes a ""blizzard blast"" that includes snow angel jumps, burpees, variations of push-ups and other high impact moves if you're feeling up for it (I wasn't).  It also has one ""icy core"" workout and a ""muscle meltdown"" that focuses on the chest.  You'll need 5, 8, 10, 12, and 15 pound dumbbells, a step and a mat.

This is a great DVD for those who want targeted muscle training with a bonus cardio boost.  Outside of the ""blizzard blast"" there aren't any high impact moves but you'll be out of breath and your body will feel worked by end!  Highly recommend.",1457049600,10,2040,4.73371104815864
7585270,5,B019WN2HFQ,Very effective and challenging workout The only way you won't get in shape with this is if you don't use it !,1456876800,2,109,4.0
7585271,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Good workout!  I agree with previous viewer it's a solid workout that won't leave you depleted.  That doesn't mean it isn't a good workout.  My heart rate was up several times, but I was not gasping for air.  My muscles felt worked, but not shaking.  I consider myself to be at an intermediate level.  I have been at advanced level, but I'm slowly working my way back from a long injury.
There are many different premix and timesaver options that I always love on workout DVD's.
I popped the DVD in the day I received it and started working out.  The main workout is about 45 min.  Lots of combination moves with weights.  Then it goes into The Blizzard Blast that is about 12min.  Lots of air jacks, jumping jacks and burpees.  Then it went into the Muscle Meltdown-Chest.  It's about 15min.  A step is used in this segment.  You do push-ups; the chest press, and chest fly sets are done on a flat step and then on an incline step.
There was a stretch segment then the Icy Core segment.  Which is floor ab work.  This segment is about 11min.",1453507200,22,1042,4.37696335078534
7585272,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Workout time: 47:53 minutes
Equipment: 5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, step and mat
Muscle Meltdown: Chest
Outfits: Hot pink tops with black bottoms

Thanks to Cathe, I have become quite the fan of metabolic workouts.  Metabolic workouts are those that have compound exercises with little or no rest in between sets so you maximize calorie burn.

Some fun, new exercises include:
Figure 8 arms with front lunge
Dynamic front lunge with lat raise
Squat thrust with 5 lb weights
Squat jab with 5 lb weights.

The Chest Meltdown uses 12 pound weights, which surprisingly, I found to be too light.
The Blizzard Blast continued with the theme of metabolic training.  There are lots of burpees and squat thrusts so be forewarned.",1452988800,5,724,4.806451612903226
7585313,5,B019WN2HFQ,"I love this DVD.
Easy to follow and not boring.
I'd like more of these types of workout dvds.
I don't feel like I work abs enough in the 40 min workout so I do the abs added bonus.",1482796800,,180,3.641025641025641
7585314,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Fun, many new moves, great workout. Makes the workout go by quickly.",1482451200,,68,4.75
7585315,5,B019WN2HFQ,Love Cathe! I love this workout! I use a heart rate monitor and my HR is mostly above 77% sometimes reaching 94%. I love how this dvd works out my entire body! I take a caffeine pill with the workout and last time I burned 675 calories!,1480464000,4,236,4.042553191489362
7585316,5,B019WN2HFQ,Great workout! Definitely for intermediate. Love the challenge!,1479600000,,63,7.0
7585317,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Metabolic training seems to be the new buzz workout these days.  It is time efficient and effective and you get the most bang for your workout buck.  It is mainly compound movements where you are working upper and lower body at the same time which really ups the heart rate too.
While this is an effective way of training, I have never been a huge fan of compound movements for a few reasons.  Some of the moves are clumsy and complicated for me, or using a weight for one muscle group might be too heavy or light for the other, and so on.

Metabolic Total Body on the other hand is perfect for me, I really like this workout.  I feel that it's designed for more light to moderate weight as opposed to heavy weight.  Cathe has included exercises where the weight selection is appropriate for both muscle groups that you are working.  The pace is just right, not too fast or too slow.  The amount of reps is just right as well.  And the workout is fun, the setting is bright and colorful and the music fits well.  I also like the workout length, it's around 45 minutes which is perfect for me.  I don't find that I have the attention span for workouts more than an hour these days.

Plus there are all the premixes and add ons, there is a Muscle Meltdown for Chest, Blizzard Blast and Icy Cores.  I find the Blizzard Blasts are usually a little too high impact for me but I pick the ones that I like and do them anyway, just adds a little more to the workout.

I give this workout 5 stars, Cathe has a few metabolic workouts, but this one is my personal favorite.  Well done Cathe!",1479513600,3,1580,4.25503355704698
7585318,5,B019WN2HFQ,"I love, love, love this workout! It goes at a nice pace, the energy is good, Cathe is her usual great instructor self and I feel like everything was as advertised.",1474761600,,163,4.290322580645161

7585321,5,B019WN2HFQ,Ordered this dvd and sent it back due to problems where it wouldn't play. Received second dvd that has similar bad quality. ReturnING THAT ONE TOO,1469232000,,146,4.653846153846154
7585322,5,B019WN2HFQ,"The workouts are GREAT.  The one thing I love the most is the fact that Cathe does different workouts as opposed to doing the same workout for 15 reps at a time.  She also gives a little breather in between the workouts.

My DVD is pretty new and for some reason it skips on me.",1468454400,,278,4.0181818181818185
8746210,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Let's face it, Cathe's workouts are not for the faint of heart. They're tough and they get results. But, if you're a beginner Cathe can be mighty intimidating. The ICE workouts are a great starting point for beginner to intermediate exercisers. They're hard, but you can make it through. She uses weights, 3, 8, 10, and 15 - easy to modify. Typically my workouts consist of either a run or a weight workout at the gym. This is my favorite workout in the ICE series.",1530403200,,465,4.482352941176471

8746213,5,B019WN2HFQ,Cathe's Ice Series is the best series she has done.  I have done all her series but this one is by far the best she has ever done.  It is high intermediate workout.  It is also great for advanced exercisers who are older or don't want to have their lungs ripped out like some of her workouts!  Please Cathe do and ICE 2 and do less advanced workouts!  I rate this one up with Low Impact and XTrain series.,1504742400,,405,4.075949367088608
8746214,5,B019WN2HFQ,"It's a tough one,",1504483200,,17,3.5
8746215,5,B019WN2HFQ,"I would recommend purchasing the entire ICE series.  It consists of 7 discs, and it's a wonderful way to change things up and keep boredom at bay, although, I have to admit, I don't find any of Cathe's DVDs boring.  She includes many different premixes, and always keeps it interesting, and challenging.  She has so many wonderful other DVDs also.  I'm so very appreciative that my sister told me about Cathe, and now I am a life-long Cathelete for sure!!!",1493596800,,456,4.6625
8746216,5,B019WN2HFQ,"Thank goodness!  Finally, exercise the way it was MEANT TO BE.  I am 48 years old and workout to mostly Cathe.  Lately, her workouts have just been exhausting me to burn out and I desperately wished she would make an intermediate workout so I could have a break!!  Answer to my prayers.  I bought the entire series of course and have done the kickbox and chiseled upper body so far.  Didn't care for either but this one changes everything and it is unlike any workout I have ever done before.  It flows beautifully, works your entire body at all times beautifully, keeps the heart rate up and the sweat pouring yet you're not so exhausted that you can't even feel what you're doing yet because you're just trying to stay alive which is the feeling I always get with her other workouts..........  With this one I was working hard, I felt it every minute, I was challenged, could make it harder or easier if I wanted to and could feel every single thing I was doing throughout  my body the whole time.  Topped if off with her icy core bonus and I got an hour of exercise the way God intended, I think!!  Good job Cathe.  Want some more like this.",1490486400,2,1144,4.369668246445498
8746217,3,B019WN2HFQ,"""It's okay ""  because I did not earn a feeling of accomplishment  after doing the main routine, and was actually a little bored because I felt that everybody was just going through the motions, and the genuine-ness of other C. Friedrich's workouts was absent. For instance at one point she forgets to instruct us about the exercise to perform (""did you catch that!?"") and so I was off in the transition. This routine also feels very ""ICE"" / intermediate (what is meant by that is: in no way easy but also not at all as challenging as (all?) of her other routines. However, the blizzard  blast is not at all intermediate; it contains a lot of jumping  for instance, and is intense ( ""I hope you like angel jacks because they are sprinkled all over this routine""-- I don't like them at all.). I returned this one as well as Boot Camp.  I find some of the ""bonus(es)"" disappointing as I have the same ones on several  of this series. Still, this is for serious intermediate exercisers, and for  very serious new exercisers  to Cathe Friedrich. She still is absolutely professional and pleasant, but it is the second DVD of the ICE series I am returning --and I gave it / them a fair trial.",1487721600,2,1186,4.4837209302325585
