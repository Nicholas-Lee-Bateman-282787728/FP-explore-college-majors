8225425,4,B000WSVBWQ,"excellent and inspirational, but almost no plein air theory. It does make it look way fun, though!",1219881600,,98,4.823529411764706
8225426,5,B000WSVBWQ,"I found these DVDs on Plein Air painting highly informative and kind of spiritually uplifting.  The locations and the spontaneity of the artists painting on location show what painting out-of-doors is all about. The artists are experts and awesome to watch. I can recommend these DVDs wholeheartedly to anyone who wants an inside glimpse at a real art experience and loves nature. Contrary to another review, I think the producers showed restraint by not wasting natural resources on superfluous and expensive packaging.",1206316800,2,520,5.341463414634147
8225427,1,B000WSVBWQ,"Potential buyers should note that the ONLY packaging that these DVDs come with is a single cardboard sleeve, no larger than it has to be to fit the disk. It seems to me that, for $25 dollars per disk they could at least package these in a standard DVD box with the name on the spine so that I could file them with the rest of my DVDs.",1197936000,4,334,3.926470588235294
