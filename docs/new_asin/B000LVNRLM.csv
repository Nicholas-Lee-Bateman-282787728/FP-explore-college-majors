2714989,2,B000LVNRLM,I was disapointed when I discovered that this was not footage from original performances.  As I continued to watch I was really enjoying listening to the music it brought back many memories and the performances were well done.  If you like Motown this is worth viewing.,1174089600,,269,4.826086956521739
2714990,4,B000LVNRLM,"As Barbra Streisand once sang ""THe Way We Were"", this early day's of Motown brought back the thrill of a new sound that is close to anyone's heart over the age of 50.  Oldies, Oldies and more Oldies.  I can relate to the feeling of the heart and soul of the 60's.  Thanks to Berry Gordy!!!",1174003200,,289,4.125
2714991,1,B000LVNRLM,"Even though it's described as ""The Early Years"", these are all recent performances. A rip off.",1173830400,,94,4.9375
2714992,3,B000LVNRLM,This DVD shows a pretty sad state of affairs. The performers look (and sound) terrible and are way past their prime trying to party like its 1969 (Martha Reeves trying to squeeze in a 60s style dress is particularly pathetic). Imagine a senior citizens home giving a performance at the Apollo Theater and you get the idea.,1173744000,,322,4.666666666666667
8164534,1,B000LVNRLM,I was expecting original footage. This seemed more like one of the PBS donation drives with the older groups and parts of groups.,1426377600,,129,4.6521739130434785
8164535,4,B000LVNRLM,"Harder to find Motown collectables but this one is worth the CD purchase.
Nice surprises for those of us old enough to remember .",1356652800,,129,4.416666666666667
8164536,4,B000LVNRLM,RELAXING  ENJOYING LISTENING TO GREAT MUSIC OF YESTERDAY. FAVORITE TUNES OF THAT TIME SEEING  THE GROUPS  AND SOLO PERFORMERS  BRINGING MOTOWN SIZZLE . GREAT TO HAVE AND WATCH BESIDES LISTENING IS AWESOME.........,1355270400,,213,5.5625
8164537,1,B000LVNRLM,"I did not see the original PBS broadcast but have read the reviews of those who did. It is terrible that a dvd of a broadcast would have less features than the broadcast when it is usually the other way around.

This dvd was not done very well. The vintage footage is minuscule. How could they pare down a 90 minute show to just 40 minutes?

I could barely hear some of the singers. They were drowned out by the band. The sound system was not very good. I fast forwarded through most of this dvd.",1339027200,,496,4.15625
8164538,3,B000LVNRLM,"the video was ok,
but i thought it would be the stars singing their songs when they were young,not a concert of them singing now. That's what i was really looking for. The title was misleading.",1307059200,,193,4.388888888888889
8164539,3,B000LVNRLM,"Despite the title, this IS NOT a collection of archival clips of Motown's classic groups. This was a PBS television concert special featuring performances by some of Motown's surviving early artists from 2005.

I purchased this DVD with the high hopes that I was seeing the original television broadcast with the promotional bits cut out. What I soon realized though, was that alot more had been cut than that! Only about 36 minutes of the special remains here, of the original 96 or so minutes. Many of the performances, artists, and hosts of the evening have been cut. Besides the acts listed on the cover (Martha Reeves, The Velvelettes, Joe Billingslea's Contours, The Four Tops, and Dennis Edwards' Temptations Review), the original broadcast also showcased performances by Kim Weston, Gladys Horton of The Marvelettes, Brenda Holloway, and probably more! Also, the original broadcast featured archival footage of people who could not make it that evening (Mary Wells, The Supremes, etc.) Here, the only saved archival footage, is a few bits and pieces here and there in introduction for Martha Reeves and The Four Tops.

I could go on for hours here about what this disc is missing, so I'll just cut to the chase. This is not a really good DVD. For all of those who saw the special on t.v. and are considering buying this DVD, you are probably going to be very disappointed. However, for all those who want to see what Martha looks like, and are curious about The Velvelettes, and/or just wanna see someone singin' those hits, this might be the disc for you. I really only gave this DVD three stars because it gave me a chance to see Martha and The Velvelettes, and I really like that Four Tops song ""Bernadette,"" even though it WAS NOT Levi Stubbs leading the group. (He's been too ill to perform for a very long time now. But he is sitting in the audience.)",1223769600,,1865,4.717791411042945
8164540,5,B000LVNRLM,This DVD is one of the best products I have seen relating to the MoTown story..  It is entertaining and informative.  I loved it!!!!!!!,1190592000,,135,4.583333333333333
8164541,1,B000LVNRLM,"I first saw this when it came on constantly on my local public broadcasting station and I really enjoyed it, but I wanted to be able to watch it without having to listen to someone try to beg me to donate money, especially since they would cut off several performances. So when it finally was available to buy in stores I was excited.
Boy was this a let down. First of all its only 40 minutes long, second a large chunk of the performances include archival footage of some of the original concerts were completely cutout. I was livid. Luckily I had rented this instead of buying it out right. So I'll just send the movie back, but this has definitely taught me a lesson, sometimes it is better to rent first even if you ""saw"" the program before that way you won't get ripped off.",1183852800,,779,4.342465753424658
8164542,5,B000LVNRLM,"This DVD release of early Motown music features up beat Rhythm and Blues performances by survivors of several groups. For a baby boomer this is my kind of music. Good thing this is not a release from the archives; those might be too poor in quality for my taste, and the quality of the ""cameo"" black and white video pieces inserted on this DVD clearly suggests that. Once again this is a good job by T.J. Lubinsky and Shout Factory.

One reviewer finds the title of the DVD misleading because it suggests the concerts are the originals from the early 1960s which they are not. Those early concerts do exist for purchase. Examples are ""The Temptations- Get Ready- Definitive Performances, 1965-1972"", and ""Motown Gold, from The Ed Sullivan Show"". The focus in this DVD is on the music of the era, hence the title.

Considering the quality of the performances and especially, of the video, I am very satisfied with the DVD, which also up-converts very well for display on HDTV.  While the audio has no DTS option what it has is sufficiently good.

NOTE: there is indeed a longer version of this DVD which includes more archival footage. It plays for about an hour longer than this DVD plays.",1181692800,,1189,4.647619047619048
8164543,3,B000LVNRLM,"For those complaining that calling this ""The Early Years"" is misleading, reading the packaging or product descriptions should have clued you in that these are performances from the current acts.  You should have been clued in when the bands have names like ""Joe Billingslea's Contours"" and ""The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards.""

The performances are decent for what they are...I was kind of confused by the audio on Martha Reeves' performances, which sounded very much like pre-recorded tracks as opposed to the other performers, who sound live.  The Temptations Review actually sounds better than the current Temptations, and The Four Tops, even with a younger lead singer, still sound great.

If you can get this for less than $10, definitely pick it up.  If not, only buy if you're a HUGE fan of all the songs.",1178064000,,826,5.044117647058823
