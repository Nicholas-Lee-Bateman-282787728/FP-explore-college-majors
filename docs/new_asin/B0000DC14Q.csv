8000537,2,B0000DC14Q,"Buyer beware regarding Star Packer with Lucky Texan, both starring a young John Wayne on one DVD from Westlake Entertainment. Even at $0.25 plus $2.98 shipping, this is only for those who are going to watch on a nine-inch or smaller television screen. Both source prints are soft dupes with much surface noise and drop-outs.

Both films are worth watching if you buy better versions. These are early John Wayne, five-day wonders cranked out for Lone Star Pictures during the mid-1930s. John is supported by George ""Gabby Hayes"" and Yakima Canutt. The story lines are fairly simple but entertaining.

If you can find this at a Dollar Store and don't care about quality, then these will suffice. But don't watch on a big screen and certainly not on an HD screen. So, thumbs up for the films but thumbs down for this DVD.",1173398400,,818,4.713286713286713
