2901719,1,B000TJBN7Q,"Although I am not a big fan of zombie movies, I did like 28 Days Later (and Shawn of the Dead).  So I was looking forward to 28 Weeks Later.  The first sign of trouble ahead was the fact they included 2 children in the plot.  But I figured the first one was inventive and scary that thy would be able to use them effectively.

The first 5 minutes were promising... a dark, lonely farm house, a small group of people gathering for dinner... and then attached by zombies (well, okay, victims of the Rage virus). But ten minutes into the film, things started quickly going down hill.  Two characters (guess which) do the most incredibly stupid thing (along the lines of a pretty girl who is warned not to enter the haunted house but enters it along, anyway).  The stupid act is compounded but one of the biggest coincidences in the history of cinema.  Couldn't the film makers (even the caterer who supplies the actors food) find a little bit more logical or suspenseful way of restarting the virus?

Apparently not.  By this point we already know that the janitor has a super-duper security access key and the army has decided not to guard the person infected with the virus... put two and two together and pretty soon you have a crisis on your hands.

By the time they got around to the zombie who gains Freddie Kruger like invulnerability tracking the children down in spite of inferno-like fireballs and other obstacles, I couldn't take it anymore.  Hence the title of my review...",1179100800,7,1482,4.575757575757576
2901720,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" put an interesting twist on the Zombie Film genre, namely that the zombies technically weren't dead; they fell victim to a virus that turned them into raging, animalistic monsters. And they actually ran after their prey as opposed to ambling along like drunks, moaning and groaning all the while. But despite the prominence of blood and guts, the effectiveness of that film depended more on the human drama, centering on an isolated group of survivors trekking across the British countryside. For the most part, the same formula is followed for ""28 Weeks Later,"" which is probably why it works. The only difference between the two films is that this one is larger, with more characters, more violence, and more gore. Does that make it an inferior film? No, not really--surprisingly, it remains on equal ground.

The film opens during the middle of the original crisis. A small group of people barricaded in a rural cottage is ambushed by the Infected. The only escapee is Don (Robert Carlyle), someone the audience will have trouble labeling as either good or bad. On the one hand, the fact that he abandoned his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack), and left her for dead doesn't put him in a good light. On the other hand, any one of us would probably do the same thing when thrust into such a desperate situation. It's all about survival; it's no longer about love and commitment.

The story then flashes forward six months. The American military has since stepped in and successfully decontaminated and reconstructed an isle directly adjacent to London; twenty-four hour electricity has been restored, as have hot and cold running water and supermarkets (they've also reopened a pub). Fifteen thousand people populate the area, with more survivors arriving everyday. The two most important survivors are siblings Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), Don's adolescent children. They're absolutely delighted to be reunited with their father ... that is, until they learn that their mother is gone. Worried at the prospect of forgetting all about her, they decide to sneak out of the safety zone and pay a visit to their old house.

Once there, they discover that their mother is still alive. She's then examined by the American military; as they feared, she's infected with the Rage Virus. Yet she doesn't show any symptoms, which leads Medical Officer Scarlet (Rose Byrne) to believe that Alice is carrying some kind of antibody. Could this mean that a vaccine is on the horizon? Maybe even a cure? Unfortunately, no one will ever know; a series of mishaps reintroduces the virus to the population, resulting in pandemonium. The military is forced to execute Code Red, which states that everyone must be exterminated whether or not they're infected.

The rest of the film is effectively frantic and fast paced, focusing its energy on Andy and Tammy's fight for survival. At this point, Scarlet realizes how important the siblings are; if their mother carried an antibody for the Rage Virus, chances are at least one of the children does, as well. This is quite an interesting reversal: the siblings' love for their mother essentially made them responsible for reintroducing the virus, and now they may be the only ones who can stop it from spreading. This shows a complexity and depth that's rarely present in a horror movie, and it takes on greater significance during some of the film's more gruesome scenes. Example: gunning down innocent people proves too much for Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a dedicated military officer. In a direct violation of his orders, he decides to help Tammy and Andy escape.

But for the dedicated Zombie Film fanatics out there--the ones who could care less about such complexity--you can rest easy knowing that this film contains plenty of frightening, blood-soaked moments. I'll be the first to admit that it's a lot of fun to watch; that's half the appeal of a Zombie Film. But make no mistake: ""28 Weeks Later"" completely avoids B-movie territory, allowing believable drama to get through to the audience. Even in the midst of violence, gore, and terror, the audience can feel the emotional turmoil toying with the characters, even the ones that aren't as decent as they appear to be.

The film works in other ways, as well. I distinctly remember a scene near the end of the film with Scarlet, Tammy, and Andy in the London Underground. It's pitch black; Scarlet relies on her night vision scope to help the siblings move along. They try to avoid stepping on the dozens of rotting corpses littering the floor. The intentionally amateurish nature of Scarlet's point of view solidified the scene, allowing the audience to actually feel the tension along with the characters. This was the most frightening scene of ""28 Weeks Later,"" and it alone shows that the filmmakers knew what they were doing. It's quite original as Zombie Films go, cleverly balancing sheer terror with drama. And yes, it also has a lot of cool makeup effects.",1179014400,,5008,4.963051251489869
2901721,5,B000TJBN7Q,"I'm always weary of horror sequels...they usually just don't cut the mustard (Loved ""The Ring"" but its sequel was miserably bad!).  This sequel lives up to its entertaining predecessor and may actually be better than the first!

The story picks up six months after the virus ravaged London, with a couple (played by Catherine McCormack and the talented Robert Carlyle) who are living with a group of survivors in a boarded up home.  Soon, however, their quiet hideaway is attacked by a group of blood thirsty ""ragers"" and Carlyle's character shows his true cowardly nature, leaving behind his wife to be killed and saving himself, above all others.

When we next see (Carlyle) he is being reunited with his children in an area sanctioned off by the US government and Nato.  With snipers set up to watch the safe zone and giving complete medical exams to clear the returning citizens, the project looks to be a successful attempt to eradicate the virus infected zombies and the virus itself.  But when the couple's two children escape the safe zone, return to their old home and find their mother, still very much alive, the virus returns.  Though the mother doesn't exhibit the signs of the zombies, she carries the disease and can still transfer it, setting a course for the return of the blood spewing zombies.  However, the mother, because she is genetically immune to the symptoms (and possibly her children as well) is an important key in fighting the virus and the chance of truely stopping it from spreading.

Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job of following the lead of the first director but upping the action a bit for the second go around. Robert Carlyle does a great job as a very flawed man who will do anything to survive, including turning his back on his own family.  This is a great horror movie, a good summer action movie and definitely worth seeing!  Highly recommended!",1179014400,17,1894,4.779141104294479
2901722,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Those who come to 28 WEEKS LATER from its original 28 DAYS know the general plot and themes.  England has been overrun with crazed zombies who have been infected with the Rage Virus.  The original was a smash hit partly because of its suspenseful direction and partly because of some pretty effective scenes of gore.  In this sequel, director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has added some troubling subtexts of political allegory, with an occupying U. S. Army clearly representing the current force in Iraq.  Some reviewers have noted what they think is a plotless gorefest.  Gore there is in plenty but it is not for that which gives the movie its unforgettable tang.  Fresnadillo has succeeded in the rarest of all horror director goals--to place the audience right there in harm's way. The film opens with a married couple (Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack) seeking refuge from the zombies in a farmhouse.  When the zombies break in, he panics and runs, leaving his wife to fall into their clutches.  At this point, comparisons to other walking dead films become inevitable.  George Romero in the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD chose to portray his zombies as stiff-legged reanimated ghouls who lumber slowly after their victims.  Here the zombies are mercurial insane killers, not dead but akin to the true criminally insane who are human in all areas except in their brain dead desire to bite the living to infect them.

As the husband escapes to find his children alive (Imogen Poots and McKintosh Muggles) in a rebuilding London, he discovers to his shame that his wife has survived only to unintentionally infect him.  What follows is a nightmarish set of fragmented holocausts in which he spreads the infection to thousands of others in just a few hours.  His infection is particularly graphic. We can see how in less than a minute the light of humanity vanishes from his eyes to be replaced by a blackness of mindless rage that gives the virus its name. Though he is patient zero in the re-infection of London, he does not merge into the tsunami of the similarly infected.  Like Coleridge's Albatross he continues to reappear at inopportune moments to torment his disbelieving children that their father has vanished to be replaced by a relentless doppleganger whose very ferocity to infect them becomes the driving symbol of the film.

I did have a problem with the point of view that Fresnadillo chose to take whenever the zombies appear on stage. At that point, he accelerated the frenetic pace of the film so that all the zombies began to run at top speed to the point that their faces began to merge into each other in a blur.  This proved to a be predictable distraction. Fortunately however, Fresnadillo had the sense to slow down his camera whenever the father made his frequent appearances.  Whenever I see a zombie film, I always wonder how the zombies act when they are not munching on victims. Why do they not attack each other?  Do they rely on sight and smell to distinguish themselves from humanity?  When Fresnadillo chooses to accelerate the pacing of the film, perhaps he tries to circumvent this potential philosophical distraction by forcing the audience to focus on the humans as the zombies see them rather than on how the zombies see each other.

The film has a number of individual moments of power, not all of which deal with zombie violence on humans.  By midfilm, the focus shifts to human violence on uninfected humans as soldiers are given a morally troubling order to shoot everyone running out of a building when only a much smaller number of them are Ragers.  By the time we get to the closing reel, we can see that the Ragers have no choice to kill.  A virus drives them on.  But uninfected humans are ragers in their own fashion as well.  They kill out of fear, hatred, or in response to sanctioned orders.  It is this non stop series of moral subtexts that renders 28 WEEKS LATER as a film that one will want to revisit, perhaps even after less than 28 weeks.",1179014400,25,4006,4.744588744588745
2901723,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Everything in 28 Weeks Later clicks. The acting, plot, and SFX are all first rate. I had mixed feelings about 28 Days Later, but this one kicked this horror fan in the nuts numerous times.",1178928000,,188,4.4
2901724,5,B000TJBN7Q,"A watershed film, Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was a gripping hybrid ... a zombie art-film. Boyle showcased his talents as a world-renowned director while creating a work that left cosmopolitan horror-enthusiasts in awe. Aside from the gorgeous cinematography, ""28 Days Later"" recognized the original intent of zombie-film: to act as social commentary. ""White Zombie"" (1932) and ""Revolt of the Zombie"" (1936) set a historical tone for zombie-film which was somewhat lost after Romero's trilogy. But Boyle revived the zombie-film in 2002 ... giving zombie-fans and academics a reason to love zombies again!

""28 Weeks Later"" has Boyle's fingerprints all over the film (he was, in fact, involved in some of the directing): 1.) Robert Carlyle is cast in a lead role (you may know him as Begbie from Boyle's ""Trainspotting,"" 2.) the soundtrack is a continuation of John Murphy's original score (in fact, I heard variations on the track ""The Tunnel"" throughout the film,) 3.) it uses Boyle's trademark bridge-shots, and 4.) it employs Boyle's use of a digital format.

The film itself is fast-paced, action-heavy, and extraordinarily tense. It is shocking and gripping. Unlike ""28 Days Later,"" the film opens with a ""weak"" but sympathetic character who is trapped in a heinous lie ... which ultimately leads to the second outbreak. It is an ""edge-of-your-seat nail-biter."" Quite literally, I never heard one audience member utter a single word through the duration of the work. It offers not a moment for reflection ... it is completely relentless. Perhaps not until the drive home will you decide if you liked the film or not ... or even begin to process it.

Now, it must be said that there were some failings. **SPOILERS** Foremost, the recycling of thumb-through-the-eyes assault was less an homage to the original than a needless repetition. Second, while Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" delivers the horrific tales of Infection through narration (Jim was comatose throughout the spread), this film actually shows the audience the carnage in close-quarters. While some may find this thrilling, many will find it gratuitous. To clarify, when asked to name the bloodiest horror-film of all-time, people inevitably say ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ... but Hooper's film is a virtually bloodless work. What's the relevance, you ask? On-screen violence tends to be less potent than the violence an audience member IMAGINE. (Which is why Nispel's remake of ""TCM"" was a critical failure). Moreover, the conclusion can be predicted in the first twenty-minutes of the film which may leave you a little frustrated. (But it's still a great conclusion!!) Finally, while the soundtrack echoes the original film, the attention granted to the first film was lacking here. ""28 Days Later"" had a cutting-edge appeal: including ""God Speed You Black Emperor"" and excerpts from Faur's ""Requiem"" (namely ""In Paradisum"") on the same soundtrack was brilliant!! I wish there was more diversity in this new work ... instead, with one exception, the soundtrack is a rehash of the instrumental work from ""28 Days Later.""

Still, the attention to detail is fantastic!! Something for which to watch ... note that when Doyle selects a horse on the carousel, he chooses one named ""Zed."" ""Zed,"" as you know, is the British word for ""Z"" ... and is often used as a way to refer to zombies (see ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""World War Z""!!) Just a neat homage to other zombies films and literature!!

While the film lacks the character-development of the original, it is ambitious and exciting. Though it can never compare to the original, it will not disappoint!! It is, by all means, a five-star zombie-film!!",1178928000,,3655,5.115577889447236
2901725,4,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later... (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007)

So Alex Garland didn't write the 28 Days Later... sequel, nor did Danny Boyle direct it. I felt a bit better about this after hearing that the reason for both was time issues/contractual obligations (both were involved in the much-anticipated Sunshine when this got off the ground). So they brought in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) to both co-write and direct. I was still a touch leery walking into the theater, but the end result is that the movie was not as good as I'd hoped-- but a great deal better than I expected.

We start off with a group of survivors holed up in a cottage at the beginning of the outbreak (if you saw the original, the opening scene happens, presumably, while Cillian Murphy's character is still in a coma). Two of the people stuck there are Alice (Catherine McCormack) and Don (Robert Carlyle). During dinner one night, there's a pounding on the door, and they admit a young boy (Gary Robert Kelly's favorite actor, Beans El-Balawi). Unfortunately, the infected are hot on his tail, and you can guess the rest. Don escapes. 28 weeks later, the repatriation of Britain begins, and Don's kids Andy (the similarly wonderfully-named Mackintosh Muggleton in his first screen role) and Tammy (V for Vendetta's Imogen Poots) are reunited with him. But, as you know if you've seen thirty seconds of any trailer to the film, maybe they were a bit hasty in bringing people back to the island...

The good news is that Boyle did, in fact, act as second unit director, and directed a few scenes. The bad news, which isn't really so bad, is that it's pretty obvious which scenes they are. While the behind-the-scenes stuff they've been showing on TV singles out Boyle's direction of the opening scene, there are a few others scattered throughout as well. Boyle's adrenaline-rush jump cuts show up now and again, and there's an almost eerie similarity to the first film in those scenes. This is helped along by the fact that the producers used, for all intents and purposes, the same soundtrack John Murphy came up with for the first film, but without the silly happy synthesizer stuff that popped up now and again in that one. (And no uncredited Godspeed You Black Emperor! tracks this time round, either.) That said, Fresnadillo is a strong director in his own right, and he holds his own here. The story is less epic than the first one, with the focus squarely on Don and his kids, along with two army officers who try to help them escape the new outbreak of contagion. This could have easily become a weakness, with such a simple storyline, but Fresnadillo turns it into a strength. There are a lot of places where he could have branched out, and frankly I'd have liked to see some of them, but he kept focus throughout. He also didn't make the usual sequel mistake of showing the monsters too much, sticking to Boyle's original jump-cut plan when the infected get screen time (which is surprisingly little, actually); you get flashes, but with one ugly exception towards the end of the movie, we never get the whole ""let's unveil the monster in all its glory"" wankery so common in horror films with big effects budgets. (And even in the exception, he keeps it to a minimum and still uses the close-ups that make the infected so scary in the first place.) There were a few times I wished Garland had written the script, but Fresnadillo and his compatriots (who include the BAFTA-nominated Rowan Joffe) did well, for the most part.

The one truly weak point in the movie is that it's all set up very conveniently. You have a basic idea of what's coming from the first big plot twist (or, if you're more observant than I am, about ten minutes into the movie). That said, Fresnadillo still has a trick or two up his sleeve for the big payoff at the end of the movie, and oh, the payoff is so very, very worth it. Everything's set up nicely, and then Fresnadillo and co. sweep everything we think we know off the table.

Now, I know there are a few people who aren't going to like the sequel no matter what because it's a sequel, but in general, if you liked the first one, I think you'll get a kick out of this one, as well. Certainly worth paying matin&eacute;e price for, even if your matin&eacute;e pricing just skyrocketed like ours did. ****",1178841600,64,4317,4.630548302872063

The first ten minutes alone were scarier and more action packed than 28 days in and of themselves (and let's not forget that in those opening 10 minutes we see more infected than we see in the entire first movie).

Set 28 weeks (duh) after the original infection the US army has declared England free of infection and has begun moving British refugees back into the deserted wasteland that once was the British Isles. A kid named Andy and his older sister are the first children to arrive back in England and are happily reunited with their dad who managed to survive the original outbreak by being a really big wimp (really, you will hate this guy). the army has managed to set up a safe zone, where civies can live (almost) normal lives while, while at the same time continue to clean up the thousands of dead bodies lying all over the place in London (by the way, where did all these bodies come from when in 28 days latter we didn't see any in the streets at all?).

Anyway, after about thirty minutes of gawking at all the dead bodies and military build up, we finally get introduced to the infected. A woman is found that carries the rage virus but doesn't suffer from its symptoms. Hurray, now they can finally find a cure for the virus. But... of course the virus manages to break out, call it bad security and horrible luck, but it does. At this point the movie really starts getting good, with tons of gore (oh my god, there wasn't anywhere near this much gore in the first movie), action, and scare your pants off moments. The infection spread like wild fire, and this time WE GET TO SEE IT. Remember in 28 days when that one guy that gets chopped up by the black girl explains how he was in a crowd when the infection spread and that the only way to get out was to go up? Remember? Well that scene is played out in this movie and boy is it creepy. Its great to see how one infected person, just one, can infect hundreds, no, thousands of people. It spreads so fast that in a matter of hours the military is forced to fire bomb the city and use chemical weapons to stop its spread.

If you like zombie movies than you will love this one. It beats Romero by a mile (blasphemy I know, but just see the movie) and puts to shame everything else. Finally I got what I wanted to see, a zombie infection as it spread. No other zombie movie I can think of showed the spread of the plague anywhere NEAR as good as this one did. One minute everything is all hunky dory and the next BOOM, everyone's dead, and all because of one person. Wow.

So if you like action, see this movie. If you like gore, see this movie. If you don't get embarrassed when others hear you gasp in horror, see this movie (and if you do, just see if by yourself). This is the zombie movie of the century, beating out the Dawn of the Dead remake, Romero's Land of the Dead, and the first 28 movie. I would even go so far as to say it's the best zombie movie ever, period. so if you like zombies, and I'm sure you do if your reading this review, than drop whatever it is your doing and go see 28 weeks latter now. I know the first movie was trash, but this one isn't. if you read this review, please leave a comment.",1178841600,7,3533,4.4728682170542635
2901727,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's film was done in such a way that a sequel was almost bound to fail. Their film was a horror movie alright, but it was really an exercise in experimental filmmaking. Any film that was to follow it up will have to contend with the cool factor of not just a twist on the zombie theme (even they are not zombies) but the choice in music and look of the film. All I can say is that 28 Weeks Later doesn't disappoint and even surpasses the original film in certain aspects.

Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a great job of trying to stick to the premise begun by Boyle and Garland in 28 Days Later and adding his own signature to the sequel. The film begins with a scene which encapsulates what someone who never saw the original film needs to know about what to expect with this one. We're introduced to Don (played by a gaunt and quite haunted Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) trying to survive with several others at their English countryside cottage just outside London during the first couple weeks of the Rage-virus outbreak. This prologue shows just how tenuous any form of safe haven can be once sentimentality overrides the primal instinct for self-preservation. Don is given a choice of choosing sentimentality to try and save someone he cares about and maybe die in the process or follow the basic need for self-preservation in time of extreme danger and distress. Don picks the latter and we're shown how horrible his choice was but at the same time how plausible a decision it was when put into context. If we were put in a similar situation could we honestly say that we wouldn't had made the same choice which Don took. The scene with Don running across the open field with dozens upon dozens of Rage-infected people chasing after him was quite chilling.

The movie goes through an introductory credit sequence explaining the timeline since Don's escape from the cottage. We're told that the British Isles was quickly quarantined once authorities saw how futile it was to try and save it from the ravages of Rage in the first couple weeks. Following-up on the final scenes in the original film, we know now that those infected by Rage would soon die out due to starvation and that 28 weeks after the first sign of outbreak the world outside of the British Isles have decided that it was now time to clean out the last vestiges of Rage-infected victims who haven't starved to death and begin reconstruction and repopulation of the country. The U.S.-led NATO force in charge of this monumental project is led by U.S. Army general Stone (The Wire's excellent Idris Elba) and have cordoned off a safe sanctuary in London's Isle of Dogs where British citizens who escaped the initial outbreak or were outside the Islands when it began would be housed in while London was slowly sanitized.

This is where Don has been sent and given a job as a manager helping with getting London back on its feet. We're shown the arrival of Don's two children who were safely abroad in Spain when the outbreak first hit England. Their reunion is heartfelt though bittersweet as Don must answer his children's questions about what happened to their mother. Let's just say that Don's explanation is not exactly accurate. The Tammy and Andy (played by newcomers Imogen Poot and Mackintosh Muggleton) take his answers at face value but still end up sneaking out of the protected Green Zone to get to their old cottage to pick-up some items of sentimental value. This is the only part of the movie which seemed implausible and made me realize that once again a horror movie ended up with some characters doing dumb things that would lead to nothing but death and destruction. What the two kids find once they get to the cottage marks the beginning of re-infection and the extreme policies enacted by the military to contain the problem. But containment doesn't hold and soon enough a Code Red order is given to all military personnel.

It is once the Code Red is given that most filmgoers will see the allegorical similarities of U.S. policies and tactics in their War against Terror, especially in Iraq. While I do not prescribe to this notion, Frescadillo handled the situation well. I say I do not prescribe to the notion that the second-half of the movie is a direct condemnation of U.S. war against terror and occupation of Iraq, because it's a theme in apocalyptic movies that's been used before there was a war on terror. It is in this second-half where 28 Weeks Later reminded me a lot of George A. Romero's underappreciated horror film, The Crazies. Just like in that film, the military in 28 Weeks Later don't seem to be heartless about their reaction to the new outbreak and break of containment. Instead their overreaction to the whole deteriorating situation looks to be born more out of desperation and an inability to comprehend the best and most humane way to combat the crisis. As it's always mentioned in other forms of fiction, the military is a blunt instrument and never a subtle one. The Rage infection and those infected seem to only be stopped when using the most blunt procedures and tactics, but such ways also have a tendency to cause much collateral damage to the innocent.

28 Weeks Later is much more epic in scope that 28 Days Later and it is in that which it surpasses the original film. While the first film is more the lives of two disparating groups of survivors and how both groups attempts to survive shows how quickly one could fall from civilized behavior while another continues to hold on to it, the sequel shows that in the end even people with the best of intentions will succumb to the basic instinct of survival with any means necessary. The established shots of London overhead and down on the ground empty and lifeless really brings the apocalyptic nature of the movie with the force of a sledgehammer. These scenes followed up with the firebombing of Canary Wharf really highlights just how much more grimmer and nihilistic in tone and scope Fresnadillo's sequel over Boyle's more hopeful one. It is quite a surprise that its the actions of the youngest and most innocent (as children are usually protrayed in horror movies) which causes a new cycle of outbreak and ultimately the fall of the attempt to bring normalcy back to the British Isles.

I would say that --- even though the movie doesn't really involve zombies but zombie-like people --- 28 Weeks Later actually resembles George A. Romero's Living Dead films more than Boyle's 28 Days Later. While Boyle's film took some of its basic themes from Romero's work, he still didn't go far enough. Fresnadillo took the theme of humanity being more dangerous than the Rage-infected ones during the original film's third act and expands on it with 28 Weeks Later. There's a deep sense of pessimism and cutthroat survival instincts inherent in the film's themes. The only form of humanity to be seen actually comes from the same Americans whose attempts of reconstruction ends up an exercise in total annihilation of the problem even if it includes the innocent being destroyed in the process.

As a sequel to 28 Days Later, Fresnadillo's film shared some stylistic and thematic qualities with the original film, but ends up becoming a wholly independent work (one could watch this sequel without having seen the original and still understand what was going on). Where the original film only touches the surface of the Rage virus doomsday effect on the British Isles and its population, 28 Weeks Later ceases that basic notion and gives the viewer a first-hand look at its aftermath and, later on, how it looks when an outbreak occurs in an area packed with survivors. For a fan of Romero's classic zombie epics I do prefer Fresnadillo's work and the look of his film over the original one, but he does sacrifice some level of characterization to keep the film's tone and frenetic pacing in the latter-half from being bogged down. The film ends on a really downbeat note even as survivors make it to safety. This film really becomes an exercise in nihilism more than what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were willing to do with the original film.

In the end, 28 Weeks Later brings over enough of what made the first film such a cult, and later on, a mainstream horror success to be considered a sequel that matches the first one in quality, and at times even surpasses the original in certain aspects. The acting is actually very good despite some characters not being fleshed-out more thoroughly, but I find this understandable to keep the frantic pace of the film from start to finish from being slowed down. For fans of the first film I don't think this sequel will be a disappointment. It may not reach the same creative heights for some fans but it surely won't ruin the experience of having seen the original. The film also introduces a new face to the genre world with the excellent work turned in by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In addition to Alexandre Aja from France and now Fresnadillo, the world of horror is getting a nice infusion of young talent.",1178841600,32,9113,4.727044025157233

The pace was right on que, so to speak. A part of London has been ""reclaimed"" by the citizens that are still living a normal life or what normal is to them. The region has been declared ""infection free"", but there are other areas that are forbidden to go into that have not been fully declared or cleaned up since the ""RAGE"" Virus practically decimated England, London in particular.
I found the acting quite good and scenes were really creepy and scary this time around. We had some familiar faces in it also as of now.
At least 3 actors that have been in Marvel movies are in this sequel. I will let you see which ones they are, but I recognized them right off.
The picture and sound on this HD release was superb in contrast to the dull quality of the first movie. I was very surprised since it is 20th Century.

Excellent follow up to the incredible 28 Days Later.

The medical science fiction is not corny, and so it is perhaps a better than average story line, as zombie movies go.

Renner is the true star power here, but the grabber is the violence, the gore, the conflict of man against the zombie herd.

Some argue that these are not true zombies because the definition is: a corpse said to be revived by witchcraft, especially in certain African and Caribbean religions. It's a movie people. Call them infected, zombies, whatever...it's still a zombie-genre movie, and still worth a watch.

Of course, there is another definition for zombie: a tall mixed drink consisting of several kinds of rum, liqueur, and fruit juice. But how well does that go with buttery popcorn and York peppermint patties????

2901757,3,B000TJBN7Q,"Renner steals the show, this was almost a good movie. The first one is probably a little better. I think they tried to avoid cliches and instead ended up just making everyone look stupid.
The best was Jeremy renner who was hilarious in this, I normally don't like him in most movies but here he was great. He was out of place a bit in that he to me he just stole every scene. Spoilers....

And so he doesn't make it through to the end probably they wanted to surprise us but really he was the only really likeable person here. The kids were a weird plot device doing absolutely stupid stuff just to move the plot forward. They escape and take huge risks over a bridge and go to a dangerous quarantined area where everyone was a zombie . Check. To get a picture . Check.that maybe they could have waited and gotten in a couple months. Check. And everyone dies because of this unbelievable and idiotic thing. Check. Well at least their done doing stupid things. Not hardly they are just getting warmed up.

The then what's with the dad will see some famous actor they didn't want to waste because I had them have a couple parts in the beginning that were sort of interesting and that he was a coward which was kind of surprise but then they have essentially hang around the rest of the movie and keep showing up in the matter where they win they magically appear there is this super zombie not sure why but it made it less believable if you know what I mean

 I like how the militaries code red was so easily I fail fail. But the ultimate ridiculous blooper was watching the dad as he used to security card to open each door in succession  One by one until he finally gets to the mother while the general is talking to the everyone else you mean to tell me that the military doesn't even bother to guard the door yet they have all  this resources and planning behind everything in this huge control room that was a little hard to swallow
The mom being immune was kind of a fun twist essentially  The carrier I guess they tried to surprise us by having the dad kill her which honestly made no sense though how did she not get killed earlier in the movie when there was like five people in the room with her they were all diseased and crazy it appears that they would've killed her based on how the dad acted

 How about when the boys upstairs in the house and yells for a sister and she says nothing for no apparent reason all the mom is freaking out eating tunafish and kitty litter it was one stupid thing after another with all the wrong kinds of surprises I give us a three out of five which I believe is generous I like Jeremy Renner there so she was pretty dang funny but overall I wish I had not watch this movie and I believe that sums it up",1499558400,,2746,4.2251908396946565

Don and his wife Alice, are with a small group of people in a barricaded cottage in London. A young boy knocks on their door and they don't want to let him in. Alice says that he is just a child and allows him in. The sad thing is that zombies have followed the boy and they manage to get inside the cottage. Don escapes but he watches as the zombie tears into Alice. He leaves her for dead.

28 weeks later, the zombies are dying of starvation. The American military is bringing in the survivors and checking them for any infection. Don's children, Tammy and Andy arrives and they are happy to see their father. They were not in the country when there was the zombie outbreak.

Andy has a dream about Alice (he is slowly forgetting his mother) and they sneak out of the base and go to their home for a photograph. Andy finds Alice and she is semi-comatose and delirious. Some guards find them and take them back to the base.

Alice is quarantined and tested and they find out that she is a carrier of the rage virus. Don visits her and seeks her forgiveness. She forgives him but when they kiss, he turns into a zombie and he kills her. He breaks into a quarantine and infect people one by one. Tammy and Andy need to find a way to survive.

2901809,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later (2007)

 Virtually unknown writer/director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo was entrusted by producer Danny Boyle to write and direct the sequel to his fabulous 28 Days Later.  Most fans consider 28 Days Later to be one of the best Zombie flicks ever.  28 Weeks Later justifies the confidence that Boyle showed in the little known Fresnadillo.
 This version of the tale picks up some six months after the outbreak.  (The Zombie like behavior is caused by a virus that causes intense rage in the infected along with people munching.)  The infected seem to have a compulsion to attack, rend and viciously destroy their victims.  Biting seems to be a side issue with them, but an important issue.  These are fast Zombies as we recall from ""28 Days Later"".  Viscous fast Zombies Hell bent on destruction make very tough opponents.
  Rather than a wide brush showing of the disaster 28 Weeks Later focuses on a single family.  The delightfully named Imogen Poots plays the young daughter who with her brother are reunited with dear old dad in a safe zone created in London by the US Army.  The infected have pretty much died off by now and all seems to be getting back to normal.  Shots of the streets of London, empty of living humans, and the ominous musical score go a long way to make the desperate even hopeless but certainly somber mode of the film.  A Zombie apocalypse is no laughing matter.
 But human folly steps in, as it often does.  The dad and kids make it to a safe zone  set up in London by helpful American troops.  But people can and do make terrible mistakes.
 Robert Carlyle (""The Full Monty"") plays the dad with character flaws.  Australian born Rose Byrne (""X-Men"" films, ""Spy"") is a helpful American medico.  Idris Elba (""The Wire"", the ""Thor"" films) plays the American commander in London, even though he is actually a Brit himself.  Good work with accents there.  And Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"")  appears as an American soldier.  The cast is amazing for a Zombie flick.  As we like to say, this is a good movie with Zombies, not a good Zombie movie.  Zombie make-up meets and exceeds studio levels and all technical aspects of film making are similarly top notch.
 28 Weeks Later achieved two awards.  It got the Empire Award in 2008 for Best Horror film.  It also plucked a Spanish award for the Spanish language version, something called the Eloy de Iglesia.  I am not the only one who liked this one very much.  People paid $64 million at the worldwide box office to see it, which is big time good for a movie and unbelievable for a Zombie flick.
 This R rated stunner runs a Zombie average of one hour and 31 minutes.

2901842,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later is an overall a well done movie. The movie begins as an awesome science fiction film and continues with the study of human nature. There is a lot of suspense at the end of the movie because there is an action shoot-out with the characters chasing one another through an Army unit. It is kind of clich that the movie ends with the good characters verses the evil characters but it is a logically ending. I also love how the director Danny Boyle, captures the movie with a documentary feel.

I liked how the director captures the characters personalities. Jim is a bicycle message who goes through a traffic accident but survives. He ends up meeting Selena and Mark who don't have the infection and have to explain the situation. Selena is a realist who explains how the virus has spread through Europe and America. Its funny how Selena becomes the toughest of the group. Jim is more laid back with a sensitive side.

Eventually they meet other survivors and have to work together as a team to survive.
Overall, it is a great movie if you like suspense and sitting at the edge of your seat. I love how the characters were portrayed and the whole good versus evil concept. Great movie! I highly recommend it!",1466467200,,1219,4.536363636363636

2901849,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I bought this Blu-ray because the Blu-ray version of the original 28 Days Later disappointed me. You will notice on all the threads and boards that .everyone agrees the original looks grainy, pixilated and color-shifted. I understand that Danny Boyle wanted something strange and alienating, but that look transfers badly to widescreen Blu-ray.

So if you're like me and were hoping for a better-looking sequel that honors the quality of the original, you'll be happy with 28 Weeks Later. There's still some grain, color washout and color shifting, but less radical on the eyes. There's an extended SFX sequence of London getting bombed by night that actually looks very sharp and rich. Visual beauty comes from the most unexpected places.

The story features many characters and plot lines rather than focusing on a small group of people. You'll have to decide which approach you prefer. I liked 28 Days Later's single group approach; however, 28 Weeks Later keeps the subplots focused and discernible. 28 Weeks Later also has distinguished roster of actors such as Rose Byrne, Robert Carlyle, Idris Elba, and Jeremy Renner to keep you interested.

You know the younger daughter-after being bitten/infected by the father, will be non-symptomatic, yet carry the disease. I so dislike movies I can predicate. Why didn't the first couple of soldiers the father killed get up right away and start killing? Much more money was obviously spent on this movie, and while it had it's moments--""bigger"" plot, so much more gore, splasher guns, louder fire fights, etc... I was much more impressed with Number One--""28 Days Later"".

2902109,4,B000TJBN7Q,One of my favorite zombie movies.....next to 28 Days Later!,1414108800,,59,5.0
2902110,3,B000TJBN7Q,"This movie was okay for the most part. I think during some moments, it was my favorite, however, there are some parts that are just horrible and unintended funny.

The movie is like most other zombie flicks out there: everything is seemingly normal, then things get crazy. It follows the first movie 28 days. The number of days in the title indicate how many days since the initial outbreak. 28 weeks indicate that it's been 28 weeks since the start of the virus and England (and assumingly the United Kingdom as a whole) has been under US military control. They have a ""safe zone"" where citizens can start to return and live out daily lives under a military leadership. The first movie indicated the virus was only contained in the United Kingdom and the second movie sort of confirms that since there's no indication that any other part of the world been infected.

So in come the main characters. You got a military sharp shooter, a medic/doctor, a helicopter pilot, and two kids. There are some random minor characters here and there but nothing of significant. So the movie is really good overall but there are three reasons I gave it a 3 start.

1) The story made zero sense. At first it appears one of the kids has a rare genetic defect where he got two eye color. His mother has it and apparently survived a bit from one of the infected. The story seems to be that they have to protect the kid but never once in the story was that fact brought up. It is left to the viewer. So throughout the movie, everyone is protecting these two kids but yet seemingly for no reason other than that they are kids (which is rare in the city itself since people started moving in). So the entire fact that they decided to go off seems unbelieving yet you, as the viewer, sees that the kid is somehow immune to the disease but it's unclear exactly if anyone else picked up on that.

2) I know weapons in the movie are usually off and I tend to avoid getting upset over unrealistic weapons so long as it fits the story. However, this is where the movie gets funny. Jeremy Renner plays the soldier in this movie. He had a rifle in the movie that has a eotech and behind it he has a pvs-14 night sight. In real life, the pvs-14 draws in ambient light and with the eotech, you can easily see in the dark and hit targets really easily. I have a pvs-4 myself and I use it for hog hunting and it is really helpful item. The pvs-14 doesn't ""magnify"" though some models can. Now with that said, here's where the scene gets funny. Near the end of the movie, they go into a dark tunnel and they have to look through the optics to navigate. Now instead of seeing the ambient light and the holo reticle, we, the viewer see a cheap IR illuminated night vision that you get off a cheap camera and on top of that a reticle that doesn't match that of the eotech. The night vision doesn't match that of the pvs-14 but then again to buy a pvs-14 it could cost several grands depending on the generation and on top of that it would be next to impossible to record properly into the camera. So instead, they use a cheap IR light that shines an IR light beam like a flash light and the camera device (like that of an iphone or some cameras) can pick up the IR light and ""see in the dark."" The one they use in the movie seems to only shine about 5 ft out suggesting it was a very cheap model. That isn't how the pvs-14 work but here's where it gets funny. The character holding the optic is directing everyone around a dark tunnel in a way that is similar to that of the Blair Witch movie but instead they're screaming at each other which way to walk and they keep looking back into the optics but due to the IR illumination, it makes the eye appears bright like when you see your pet out at night. The entire scene was just so silly that I bust out laughing. Every few steps they're all screaming at each other about which way to go or watching out for something but still hitting it and it just seems awfully horrible. My thought is they could have probably made the movie without this scene and done alright, if not better by just walking around in the dark without looking into the optics.

3) The helicopter scene in one part was hilarious. So the soldier has a friend who is a pilot. His friend flying in the helicopter tells him where he is and how they're going to get back together. They finally meet in a wide open field but the pilot sees he has people with him (how he didn't see him with them but yet he flew over him the entire time is a mystery). Anyway being upset and telling his friend he won't pick up any survivors at the risk of being shot (even though the medic is military) everyone started to get desperate because there are a pack of infected coming. So one man in a desperate bid decided to jump on the helicopter's legs and held on. The pilot, really upset tried to shake him off. Now comes one of the silliest scene in movie history. The pilot, really upset there is a man hanging on and no matter how hard he shakes he can't get him off, so enraged, he decides to tilt the helicopter and chop up the pack of infested charging. The scene that follows is carnage and screaming and just things flying all over. The helicopter I thought would crash but instead it's in perfect condition minus the guy who hung on. The end result is he got the guy off the leg of the helicopter and he managed to fly away to direct the team elsewhere.

Overall the movie was alright. I liked watching it for the most part but the above problems sort of got me from thinking it was a really great film. The original 28 Days was awesome and while this movie didn't have that emotional impact, it was a pretty good follow up, in my opinion and possibly addressed some of the mysteries surrounding the first film.",1412985600,2,5784,4.282449725776965

2902181,1,B000TJBN7Q,"The first movie is easily one of my favorites, but this particular story didn't need a followup and it shows in the sloppy structure of the plot. Nothing that occurs is even remotely believable: why is the emergency plan to shove people into a tiny space with unprotected entrances? why does the janitor have unrestricted access to supposedly secured areas and why are those areas not under 24-hour surveillance? If your audience needs to turn off their brain to get through your story then the story is not very good(similarly, everyone in gotham has cancer). I didn't find myself caring very much for these characters, as opposed to the first which still gives me minor panic attacks despite multiple viewings.

if you liked this movie and want more of the same, consider the similarly terrible ""World War Z:Psychic White Jesus Holiday Funtime"". (don't actually, but do read the book as Max is a brilliant author and didn't deserve to be shamed that way.)",1399852800,,957,4.871165644171779

2902236,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Horror movie sequels aren't exactly the best the cinema has to offer, and without Danny Boyle, this one seemed likely to drop off. But it's surprisingly interesting. Maintaining the naturalistic visual style of the original, this one takes on new characters, and deals with the aftermath of the first. It effectively builds a sense of dread, and leverages the realities of epidemic disease to push the characters to difficult choices that feel real. The violence is considerable, but it isn't gratuitous, at least until the last act where the film admittedly goes off the rails a bit. It does, however, end appropriately.

There are quite a few surprises in here, and the cast is strong, some of them having gone on to bigger stardom. The score is also reverent to the original, a quality and intense piece of work.

The DVD includes a commentary, which is interesting if not easy to understand as the director is Spanish, as well as a fairly routine set of features. However you watch it, it's a worthwhile movie.",1390608000,,1014,4.82183908045977

2902241,4,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later is the sequel to the successful 2003 28 Days Later.  It stars Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Renner, Idris Elba and others.  The unique feature of this film is that it was shot on 16mm, which gives it a great look and is worth a watch to notice how much better(in my take) movies used to look.  Also, this was at a time when Renner and Elba were not quite the stars that they are today.

The basic premise is that 28 weeks later (after the outbreak shown in 28 Days Later), London has been completely overrun run the zombies.  The story follows Robert Carlyle surviving with his wife and a few others in a home before being forced out on the run.  Eventually he turns into a zombie and the film follows Jeremy Renner, a group of snipers and a young girl and boy that group up with Renner and a few others.

Overall the plot is fairly simple, its a race to get out of the city, but watching the characters make their way through the city, trying to avoid being eaten or turned is done in a fast-paced, smart way that I kept my attention throughout.  You get to see the type of shots and sequences that later became popular in Walking Dead or World War Z.

Like I mentioned, the film is shot on 16mm which gives it a great look compared to other movies of this age.  If you're interested in movie-making or the photography of film, check out this movie and Beasts of the Southern Wild.  Both are on 16mm, which gives such a different/realistic look that is totally different then how the movies of today look.  Watch World War Z(shot digitally), then watch this movie and you'll be able to see the difference.

There's many closeups(sometimes to accommodate use of 16mm) and fast-cutting parts, but overall the movie is better than average.  While we don't get depth of character or much complexity in the story, the constant suspense keeps you satisfied.",1389571200,,1860,4.448377581120944
2902242,2,B000TJBN7Q,"THE ACTING IS GOOD. However, the ending is abrupt which is disappointing because the story starts off really good. There are too many things that happen that are unrealistic considering the circumstances and it's difficult to go along with the choices being made. I would not recommend this movie.",1389139200,,297,5.081632653061225
2902243,2,B000TJBN7Q,This movie is almost unreedeemable in comparison to 28 Days Later.  The actors' performances provoked my rating of two stars.,1388275200,,125,5.25

2902277,4,B000TJBN7Q,"This was a decent follow up to 28 Days Later though not quite as good.  Most sequels made because the original became a cash cow aren't really that great, they are just thrown together to try and cash in on the popularity of the first one.  28 Weeks Later is much better than those other sequels.  It had a decent plot, good actors and some good action along with a bit of the horror that made the first one so good.",1387843200,,416,4.111111111111111
2902278,3,B000TJBN7Q,"A while back, I watched part of a documentary that showed something really disgusting:  a pizza delivery guy, on camera (he didn't know that he was being filmed) pulled up in front of a house, opened the pizza box, licked every piece of pizza, closed the lid, and then delivered the pizza.  To unsuspecting fools, fools that gave him a tip.

You should be disgusted just thinking about it, but what about me?  I had to watch.  And worse for someone else, someone else that actually ended up eating that pizza.  And that's what I was actually thinking about here at probably the beginning of the second act, when a couple of kids sneak out of a quarantined building in search of a little fun.  They find a pizza joint -- presumably closed 28 Weeks Earlier -- where there is a pizza box on the counter and another on the ground.  The kids opened the lid on each box, and I swore to God that they were going to take a bite.  Now, I know that if you haven't had pizza in over half a year -- 28 weeks to be precise -- this might be tempting.  But it wouldn't be that tempting.

And this film tries to be gross at times, but it's not as successful as the first film for sure.  ""28 Days Later"" was far more successful, as they showed really fast ""zombies"" (were they really zombies or something else?) chowing down on human flesh.  You could argue that that's gross too, perhaps grosser than eating bad pizza.  But that earlier film didn't actually make me want to puke.  Not like watching that kid almost take a bite of pizza that had been laying around for 28 weeks.  Especially if a zombie had licked all the pieces beforehand.

But worse than all of this imagery, this film uses appeal to emotion, bringing in the teenage characters here.  That just didn't work for me.  Perhaps if I were a teenager, this film would have appealed to me more?  The first film was surely targeted at adults, and it felt like to me that they were targeting a much younger audience.

Well, after that documentary that I described in the first paragraph, I refused to ever order takeout again, not that I ever did much before then.  And I should have followed some more of my own advice, which was ""Don't ever watch a sequel, especially the second in a series.  It's always unappetizing.""  Kinda like any of those pizzas, real or imagined.",1387843200,,2315,4.40566037735849

2902281,2,B000TJBN7Q,"IF (very big if) you can get past the _insanely_ stupid premise of this sequel, then this film is good fun. But the first 20 minutes are just an unbroken stream of fantastically bad plot gimmicks. Otherwise, the casting is fine, acting fine, production fine. But the ridiculous string of plot holes is a huge hurdle. Might as well have Fonzi jump the shark.

1. Letting people back after just 28 weeks.
2. Allowing people to break the security cordon so easily.
3. Letting a person with no security clearance wander around with access.
4. 'Quarantining' an infected person with _no_ security at all (meaning no quarantine).
5. Turning _off_ lights and herding people into one big space so that nobody can see a thing, and the virus can spread like wildfire.

A 5-year-old could spot the idiocy here. It makes the film unwatchable for me.",1386633600,2,837,4.726027397260274
2902282,2,B000TJBN7Q,"Ugh. Avoid this, unless you're looking for a really crappy zombie action flick -- and, even at that, you should only catch this on Prime or Netflix or something like that. I entreat you to not spend money on it.

The ONLY saving grace is that there's a bunch of zombie action, and I'm a fan of such things. That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one.

The link between this movie and 28 Days Later is... gosh... you know, I really don't remember if there's any link at all? How bad is that? This movie has the unfortunate distinction of not only ruining the first film in the *series* but also in lessening Jeremy Renner in all other roles he's in, as his performance makes you wonder how often he's mailed it in, simply playing himself.

2902296,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Not a bad movie for the zombie genre if you like that type of movie.  If you don't there's not much to recommend it.  The first movie was good although a little slow in places.  However, it had a unique take on the zombie genre.  In fact, they aren't really zombies in these movies (depending upon what your definition is I guess), but still you could see how 28 Days Later influenced the Walking Dead TV show from the very beginning where both start out with a guy waking up from a coma.  Anyway, this second movie has a decent cast with a couple of recognizable American actors and a mix of British actors that I didn't necessarily recognize.  Good acting isn't really much of a requirement for a movie like this, but the acting wasn't bad.  There isn't much plot to the movie.  In a way it is like a scarier and more violent version of Jurassic Park with a boy and his older sister trapped on an island and trying to escape from monsters with the aid of a few adults.  I wouldn't want to go into much more detail about the plot and spoil it.  However, one scene had the kids wandering in the dark and although I didn't find the scene particularly scary to view I bet it was a scary scene for a child actor to be in.  They probably had nightmares from that.  The boy in the movie doesn't seem to have done any acting since this movie which makes me curious if he had a bad experience being in this movie.  Overall, a pretty good sequel and worth watching if you liked the first movie.",1383523200,,1486,4.226950354609929

2902407,2,B000TJBN7Q,"In 2002, Director, Danny Boyle re-invented the zombie movie with his groundbreaking film 28 Days Later. Many credit Boyle with the current zombie craze we enjoy eleven years later. What made that film so enjoyable was that at the time it was a story we hadn't seen in a long time and it was shot in a way that made it look like a much older film than it was. Five years later the studio wanted a sequel and Boyle wanted no part of it, knowing that it would never live up to the original and indeed it does not. 28 Weeks Later is a continuation of the story, which claims that all the infected had starved to death and that England is free of infection once again. People start moving back in to areas of the country that have been fixed up for them and which are protected by the U.S. Government. We are then introduced to a family which has been reunited. The film starts out with a tremendous action scene that was the only part of the film I enjoyed and the only part that is reminiscent of the first film. The terrific opening is followed by a long, sappy, family reunion and then by a sick person being found. From that point, literally within ten minutes hundreds of people are infected and the army is shooting everything in sight. How could zombies have starved in the first place, but more importantly how can so many people change, just like that, within ten minutes? It didn't make any sense at all, to make things worse, all dialogue and storyline ends at that point and the movie turns into one big gory chase scene without any substance whatsoever. As for the cast of this film, they did nothing to help the story. In the first film, Cillian Murphy was amazing and carried us through the low points, but here it's a cast of newcomers and unsuccessful character actors, who quickly bring the story to a halt. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but not only doesn't it compare to the first film, but it doesn't even live up to the broad genre it is exposing us to. The cast was sloppy, the direction was confusing, and worst of all it just doesn't make any sense! 28 Days Later was groundbreaking, but it's sequel is nothing more than an over-hyped movie that never should have been made.",1372204800,,2208,4.38780487804878

2902409,3,B000TJBN7Q,"Speaking only for myself, it's easy to get lost in interpretive conflict over how to rate this film.  There are ways in it is ineluctably superior to ""28 Days"":  in its pessimism and despair, in a few magnificent, powerful, and (most of all) haunting scenes which I will not spoil.  The intense opening in particular gave me high hopes that this would leave the first installment in the dust.  Yet, this great premise is repeatedly and shamefully squandered in ""too dumb to live"" tropes, flat characters, logical inconsistencies, and sequelitis (I'm thinking of one scene in particular that was lifted in full for Robert Rodriguez's (unfortunately) superior ""Planet Terror"") that erode its strengths to mere mediocrity.  The choice to go with an American cast (fake or otherwise) seems especially forced, and it shows.  When ""28 Weeks"" is good, it's great, but when it's bad...just put ""28 Days"" in the player and make-believe.

In sum:  quite good, but nonetheless suffers by comparison with it's tightly-focused prequel.",1370908800,,1022,5.151515151515151

Directing skill, technical creativity, good plot and suitably competent acting yield a well-constructed movie. Most fans of 'Walking Dead' films should find it  quite entertaining. Even the  average viewer, with a fair tolerance for blood and ravenous people hunting other people, should enjoy it for the cinematic qualities. If one wants to get into moral issues ( I didn't), there are enough to keep you yelling at each other in a group for the rest of the (day) (evening). I suppose I have only one hesitant technical complaint: the idea of instant infection by wounding and instantaneous ""mad"" behavior was hard to swallow.

2902471,4,B000TJBN7Q,"In 28 days, Britain was destroyed by a deadly virus. It has been six months. The plague is dead, and those that escaped are slowly being reinstated back into their homes by the US Armed Forces. When a lone survivor is found hiding amongst the wreckage, military officials believe that they may hold the key to finding a cure, but unfortunately for them, she is also a carrier for the horrible disease! The Rage virus returns in 28 WEEKS LATER, and in a big way. We see how quickly the virus is able to spread again from the very beginning, as it consumes everyone in its path and takes over the streets of London once more. Collateral damage is the name of the game; when the virus strikes, the real terror isn't in being eaten... It is in dodging bullets. 28 WEEKS LATER continues the theme where man is shown to be the bigger monster, and the complete disregard for human life proves to be the most frightening. This tool is used most effectively when Robert Carlyle selfishly abandons his wife for fear of being eaten in the opening scene.

Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo steps up the action and violence in 28 WEEKS LATER, but the story leaves much to be desired. One must fully surrender to the implausibility of the plot and the giant leaps in logic in order to enjoy the film. At the very least, it seems highly unlikely that a country ravished by a deadly virus would begin repopulating itself a mere six months after the devastation. The fact that anyone could survive long enough during this period without the military spotting them in a highly secured zone is a bit much, but then to leave this person completely unguarded only to have the plague begin again requires some real incompetence. This may play into the anti-American sentiment that is embedded throughout the film, however, as the US is portrayed as being a gun-toting police state governing world affairs with semi-automatics and napalm. London turns out to be nothing more than an experiment, and when it fails, it is wiped clean.

Many of these issues could easily be overlooked had we been given compelling characters to move us through the plot, but no one steps in to win the audiences' affection. The two children are as one-dimensional as the military officials looking to save them, and even the deaths of several major characters lack emotional impact. Instead, we have an hour-and-a-half of bland characters beating extraordinary odds in order to survive. Still, there are enough stylish moments of tension and suspense to keep us watching.

Adrenalized charged follow up to ""28 Days Later, ""28 Weeks Later"" may not have the formers stark eeriness of waking up to a empty London, or at least what is thought as a empty London, but it more than makes up for it in action. It more than makes up for it in terror. It may not have the character development of the former, but it's storyline of a family tore apart from the ""Rage"" virus is definitely heartening & angering at the same time. It's story of the bond of a brother & sister is very moving, well acted & executed.

Yes, the two movies are different, but in many ways equal. Danny Boyle is not at the directors helm for this one, but new director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo infuses the film with his own brand of maniacal mayhem. The editing is fasted paced, more so than the first. The storyline of the US Military overseeing the survivors of the virus is a interesting & logical one. The sense of fear & terror are well done, especially the subway scene.

All in all this film stands on it's own very well as a major contribution to it's genre. When all it's parts are summed up, it's a great sequel, though not quite as profound as ""28 Days Later,"" nor anywhere as complex in charcter development, hence just a tad inferior, but in a oversaturated genre of Zombies & Zombie like humans, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a highly recommended terror fest!

Its not the timeless kind of movie that you could watch twice a year though. If you're looking for a timeless masterpiece in the zombie/horror genre I suggest Dawn of the Dead (the new one).

2902550,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Me and my mom wanted a good horror movie to watch and I heard great things about ""28 Days Later"".  The local video store only had ""28 Weeks Later"" in stock and I figured what the hell, let's watch it.  So we rented this one and we were pleasantly surprised.  The acting was really good (even from the child actors), the story was pulse-pounding, and it was incredibly well-made.  It was odd watching the sequel and then going back to see the original, but both are really top-quality.

The film's moody atmosphere and beautiful cinematography really captured the horror of the world these films have created.  The story itself follows a family -- in particular two children, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) -- who basically, innocently, and tragically, bring back an epidemic that was thought to be long gone.  On the verge of rebuilding the city, the children return from a holiday to their father Don (Robert Carlyle) after losing their mother...  but upon sneaking away to get personal items, including a picture of their mother so they won't ""forget what she looks like"", the children unleash a chain of events that lead to the outbreak happening all over again.  Supporting players outside the family include Scarlet (Rose Byrne), who doesn't get much characterization but her determination to keep the children safe makes her an admirable character.  The real standouts are the pair of Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Flynn (Harold Perrineau), two military men who have a fun chemistry and are forced to make tough and heroic decisions based on the children's fates.

The idea that the infection itself cannot spread due heterochromia and leaves the infected only carriers who can infect others but not themeslves is an interesting addition to zombie (well you can't really call them zombies can you?) fiction and the ambiguous ending leaves you to wonder what truly happened and leaves it up for your imagination.  The acting is good, even from the children who manage not to fall into the ""annoying horror movie children"" category (unlike the predecessor's Hannah character, whose acting was godawful!). Looking back, you wonder who's really at fault -- was it the children for sneaking out and bringing a ""carrier"" back to the city?  The military for not keeping the carrier under better watch?  Or was it just a matter of time before it happened all over again?  I love me a horror movie that keeps me emotionally attached and mentally interested, and this movie did both with the good acting all around and the cool scientific integration to the infection's background and how it all works.  I don't understand all the poor feedback, but to each their own.  I really enjoyed the movie.",1341273600,,2711,4.923076923076923
2902551,3,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was an excellent horror movie that revived the zombie genre (before 14 year old kids who laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and masturbate to 300 killed it again) similar to Romero's Night of the Living Dead. So director Juan Tacos Burritos took the next logical step in the story and centered it around the military trying to re-establish civilization in a small sect in London called district 1, even though London all around them still rots with dead bodies and likely still harbors the infection.

Anyways one of the characters played by Robert Caryle survived the outbreak and is given the job of caretaker, where he has access to everywhere inside the district assigned by the military... why? The movie never hints that he was in the military, he doesn't act like a military man and sure doesn't walk like one, so either the army is handing out these extrodinarily private security tasks to random civilians or the movie needs plot convenience to move along.

So Robert Caryle's two kids Maggintoggle Poots and Imogen Toots reunite with him and miss their mother, so they decide to sneak back into infected unsafe London to grab memorabillia and pictures, because patience is for suckaz. So two little kids sneak out of a heavily armed and guarded military base that is under heavy survellience by going on the side of one of the bridges, don't worry as the movie progresses you'll come to realize this is the most inept militia ever. Eventually they discover their mother in their old house, who's still alive and dormantly carries the infection in her. But if she can do that, other people presumably can too, but you never see them in 28 Days Later, so I just presumed that they got beaten to death or something when this plot point came up. However the mother who was in a house in the excellent opening sequence got trapped in a room with the infected flooding in, they didn't beat her to death? Did they leave her alone, because they could sense the infection or something? Did they just puke blood on her and leave? Not really a plot hole but something that bothered me.

So the military scientist's find out about the mom's situation and leave her restrained in a room with 0 guards and non-monitered survellience. Robert Caryle, using his handy dandy plot inconvienience card get past all the sercurity to the detained rare subject who can be the cure to infection, and after leaving her to die decides to start macking on her, knowing fully well about the infection, that she was left out in the infected London wastes, and not even asking what she went through, decides to start sharing saliva with her, until suprise suprise, he gets infected. Now many of my friends have argued whether or not she did that on purpose to get revenge, but if she indeed infect her husband out of revenge she got brutally killed afterwards, hundreds of people died, and her kids lives were in peril, so yeah, great revenge plan mom.

So the now-infected Robert Caryle (probably still weilding his access card) runs around the military compound and kills multiple soldier's who were presumably trained to deal with the infected, and ends up killing all of them. One unarmed infected man without armor vs approximately twenty armed guards. Hm. The rest of the military is alerted and stuffs all of the civillians in a dark cramped basement for their safety, forgetting that the back door is unlocked and Robert Caryle-zombie has apparently found it and broke in. Now people have compared this level of military incompetance to the American troops in the Middle East, politics aside that sounds like a slap-dash excuse of ""oh yeah, we meant for those soldiers to be s***ty at their jobs, see it's like topical and current!"" I don't buy it.

So the people start pouring out of the basement out into the streets were snipers are poised, and chaos breaks out via shakey cam and the snipers shoot to kill everyone basically, wait are the military guys incompetent fools? I don't understand, please movie, spell that point out for me more. So the people in hiding are intercepted by two soldiers, Jermey Renner and Rose Byrne who try to protect the people and escort them out. Eventually the group is literally chased out of the city by an explosion and into the outskirts while the city is being firebombed (and Robert Caryle-zombie avoids inceneration by ducking in an alleyway, whatever I don't care anymore).

So Jermey Renner's token black friend lands in his helicoptor and says he's only taking his friend, not anyone else or else he'll get shot down. A bunch of infected show up that survived the fireblast and are coming towards the survivors (I wonder if the big loud helicoptor had anything to do with it) and in true action stupidity token uses his helicoptor propellers to slice up the horde, spraying blood all over his helicoptor. Yeah carrying a few kids on your helicoptor will get you shot down but infected blood painted all over your helicoptor won't. Again, the helicoptor couldn't carry the kids until one of them was infected, for sequel purposes defy consistency and logic. (P.S. interesting how Planet Terror and 28 Weeks Later came out in the same month and had the same stunt, anyone know which came up with the idea?)

So the helicoptor leaves them and they're running away from even MORE remaining infected that survived firebombing and helicoptor slicing, and they run into the city, which is now being gassed (for all the military's thorough efforts, Robert Caryle-zombie can survive them all). So the survivors minus Jeremy Renner are driving through desolate London when an attack helicoptor comes, sees a car driving, and starts blasting at it with miniguns. Not only are they taking 'Code Red' to laughable extremes, but how do those fools in the helicoptor miss a lone vechicle, it's like shooting at that car for about a minute or two and can't hit the damn thing.

So the car goes into the subway and there's only 1 zombie alive, of course it's Robert Caryle, for DRAMA! So he offs Rose Byrne in a shot that Quarantine later ripped off without shame then bites Muggleton Poots or something until Imogen Toots through tears shoots him off with loud soap-opera music blaring to remind you that this is really a family drama. So now Poots (or was it Toots?) is dormantly infected, and so NOW the helicoptor pilot will take them up, and there's no apparent sign that token black pilot will get shot down. Hm.

So 28 Weeks Later was entertaining and had high ambitions, the acting was good and the whole story was pretty interesting, it just had so many plot holes glaring me in the face that I couldn't come to enjoy it as much as 28 Days Later. Sure Days had some plot holes too, but they were fewer and far between and were more ambigious instead of just plain vanilla stupid like the holes in Weeks. So some great scenes that are few and far inbetween don't make up for an overall jarring and bumpy experience of a movie. If you must watch this open a few beers first so you don't have to think very much about all the dumb crap this movie tries to get away with.",1339977600,5,7099,4.6818910256410255

The movie, without giving away much plot, involves the US Military helping with a viral outbreak in England.  A lot of inappropriate language (if you have younger viewers) and brief nudity.

The rage virus, first encountered in 28 Days Later (2002), has ravaged the UK and it falls to the Americans to take charge of the desperate situation, overseeing the recolonisation of a small part of London. Of course it doesn't go well. Soon the main protagonists are on a mad dash across the devastated city in an attempt to escape from a crazed bunch of newly-infected. The tension and horror are successfully ramped up as the film progresses. There's plenty of gore for those who like their movies drenched in blood.

The Americanized version was definitely an explosion riddled, adrenalin charged, bullet fest that celebrated the cliches of American war films and American zombie films. The problem is, the story probably was not supposed to be any of these things. The actors are certainly not believable as ordinary people, let alone ordinary British citizens. I know that they were indeed English actors but they simply are not genuine in any of the roles. Robert Carlyle is the only bright light in the film and is snuffed out so quickly that his participation is almost negligible - almost. The only reason I can imagine that misters Boyle and Garland could possibly have given this steaming pile of crap clearly cloaked in Hollywood sleaze, a pass, is that they were so consumed with their current work they didn't really have time to look over the script THAT thoroughly.....Well, one can certainly hope so anyway.

2902599,4,B000TJBN7Q,"While ""28 Weeks Later"" isn't as unique as ""28 Days Later"", I definitely like it better than the original. Instead of a largely British film crew, in this one, it's a largely Spanish film crew. Not the actors, but the directors and producers. This one is more American-ized than the original, and I think there's more terror in this one than the original. ""Days"" definitely had more of an isolated and terrifyingly depressing feel to it, and I think the original is scarier.
  ""Weeks"" picks up right where ""Days"" left off. The infection is back again, with even more violence and zombies. This one has even more of a back story to it within the characters other than the infection, which became the main point in the original. This one focuses more on the characters, since we already know about the infection from the first movie.
  The first 5 minutes of the film are kind of boring until the zombies come in a few minutes later. It makes the opening scene pretty terrifying. There are plenty other different zombie attack scenes that are pretty scary (the eye-gouging one was just gross, like the eye-gouging scene from the first). The main score to both films have a grunge rock-ish feel to them, and while it's not loud and disturbing, it's still a pretty creepy score, especially to a film that has to do with zombies.

It also seemed to move a little faster in some parts than I think it should have. There were some moments that could have used a little more fleshing out, but I think I am just nitpicking.

I liked 28 Weeks Later, with certain reservations.  It only works if you don't think too long on certain aspects of the film, purposely designed for reaction, not contemplation.  But.  There was a lot to question (plot-holes, if you will).  And it was these craters I kept falling into, saying to myself, wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.  The greatest example of this is returning people to a segment of London, supposedly clean, while just a few blocks away there were still bodies lying around.  Health issues aside...how do you keep people from roaming into unsanitary areas (which they didn't, two strayed)?  The BIG question being, why the rush to return people to an unsafe area, other than providing the story with a very convenient reason for mayhem to follow/continue.  AND, how did the dad (Robert Carlyle) happen to have the unerring knack of finding them no matter where there went/hid?  That went well beyond convenient and into the arena of being just a plot ploy.
I was also a little put off by the obvious distain for Americans, the military in general, by the filmmakers.  It wasn't necessary to the plot so one suspects a little bias on their part.  I wanted action, not political commentary.
The gem of this piece had to be the candlelight dinner sequence in the dark house that abruptly turns into mad flight in a blast of daylight.  That, and the helicopter showdown.  Wow.

Pretty soon after the rage zombies start to die off from starvation and the US army starts actions to resettle mainland Brittain. 28 weeks after the infection broke out the man meets his two kids in London and tell them of how their mother had been killed by the infected. The brother and sister end up making their way out of the secured part of London and into the still unsecured residential areas to go and visit their old home. Their they find their Mom who is still alive but a carrier of the virus. The Mom is taken back to the secured part of the city. Based on an error in judgement with the Dad he becomes infected from his wife through saliva which restarts a soon to be full-scale infection.
The second half of this film is almost non-stop chaos and action. The civilians now have no one to go to as the soldiers are now ordered to kill everyone in order to maintain the quarantine. This sequel can be compaired with ""Aliens"" considering the increased level of violence from the first film and the larger number of infected shown on screen. This movie is faster-paced and has increased gore levels than the first but also has less traditional horror elements such as suspense. This is more of an action horror film than a more standard horror film like the first. There is a helicopter scene in here that is unrealistic yet very entertaining where the pilot uses the propeller blades to chop through a field full of zombies. Planet Terror also has a similar scene with a helicopter but the main difference with this one is that limbs and body parts are shown flying everywhere while in the other it is mostly a large amount of blood splatter. It is debatable which movie did it first and who copied who. Overall this is a very entertaining sequel that delivers in the horror and gore department. Some flaws in logic such as how the infected father is able to infect the whole area drag the movie down just a bit to be not quite as much a quality horror film like the first.

This movie took everything wide and beautiful.  It's remarkable for its look.  That being the most significant thing about the film, the second most would be the story.  I enjoyed how it felt original and mysterious.  The family's story was effective and the writer inserted no cliche's.  Also, the performances were great.  Seeing Jeremy Renner pre-Hurt Locker was great.

The few problems I have with the movie do not ruin it, but rather just make the film less memorable.  Aside from some shots of the infected father, there's nothing about this movie that I look back and think ""That was awesome.""  28 Days Later had a few good ""wow"" points that I can recall off the top of my head.  The major problem with this film, is that there is no scene that I instantly remember and engage with.  I loved the baseball bat scene of 28 days later and its following ending fight sequence.  Really the only thing that was really cool about this one was the ""sniper-bait"" scene with the kid and Jeremey Renner.  The helicopter scene was underdone, in my opinion.  My only other problem was its sound editing.  The first scene was WAY TOO QUIET!!!!As well as some others.

Other than the fact that 28 Weeks Later is somewhat unexciting, the story and style are equally as beautiful.  It's a blast to look at.  The only thing I would have asked for was a stronger element of action.  Certain horror films, such as the recent Hills Have Eyes, are amazing for they're intense fight scenes.  Have some infected duke it out with humans in a well choreographed environment and we're due for a classic.  To conclude, 28 Weeks Later certainly does justice to the first film, but it does not do justice to its own potential.  It had the tools to be groundbreaking.",1279152000,,2322,4.636363636363637

2902649,3,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later combines melancholy music, dark cinematography and camera shots that alternate between long fluid movements and careening hand held footage in order to draw the audience into disturbingly graphic scenes. In the sequel, the audience is taken on an action packed journey with the Harris family as they attempt to escape the disease that affected millions of individuals across Great Britain in the original modern day zombie film.

  The film is launched with a heart pounding chase scene that leaves Don Harris as the sole survivor among a group who has taken refuge at a small farm in rural England. Coincidentally, it is Don and his wife who open the door to the rebirth of the zombie disease, which sends their very own children on a journey to escape the condemned country. The movie climaxes with an escape scene shot nearly entirely in night vision. Although fans will adore the grainy quality of the movie, which filmmakers carried over from the original, and the fast paced story, there are a few problems with the sequel.

  Story line was not this film's strong point. The audience can see that a good idea was in place, but not carried through to the screen with complete clarity. Supporting characters enter and exit scenes in such a dominating fashion that the audience has trouble identifying the main character of the film. Also, the main point of the film is a mutation of the original virus. A nice idea, yet with the mutation the filmmakers added several discrepancies in character, which are not thoroughly explained by the mutation explanation. In other words the zombies do not obey as the audience expects.

  In addition, many scenes were built around jarring hand held footage that is designed to disorient the audience, yet at times the footage becomes so jumbled that it is difficult to identify the character actions. In some instances the bouncing shots are so obtuse that the footage becomes nearly monotonous.

  Coming from a fan who thought the original film was one of the most innovative horror movies of modern filmmaking, 28 Weeks Later is an entertaining ride that I suggest movie goers choose to experience from a comfortable recliner at home.",1263427200,3,2195,4.91869918699187
2902650,1,B000TJBN7Q,"What makes any film compelling is not the splatter or special effects deployed, or the noisy, furious intensity of its direction; but rather its characters and their situation. Do we care about them and their journey? This sorry sequel offers the wrong answers. You will not care about the characters in this film, so what happens to them is of no consequence whatsoever. Think back to what you truly enjoyed about 28 Days Later. An artificial family unit coalesces, comprised of distinct, well-drawn characters who come to care about each other. We get to see their perils, and the lengths to which they will go to help each other. Unexpectedly, the 28 Days soundtrack is dreamily serene, accompanying visuals which are artful and expansive. In this context, the violence, when it comes, seems even more uncomfortably close and visceral. And since we care about the characters in the first film, the violence is even more real and terrifying. In fact, every violent scene in the original film has purpose, pushing its plot and characters forward. This sloppy, nihilistic sequel offers few moments of calm or contrast, little purpose or poetry, and no imagination, but instead a great deal of splatter and noise. There's nothing compelling or uplifting here, or anything informative in its dismally obvious, satiric sensibility. Our time on earth is short.

Among them are two children (played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton; one of the best scenes of the movie has nothing to do with zombies and have them running through the deserted streets of the English capital). As expected, though, the zombies have not exactly disappeared, and are bound to return with a vengeance.

2902653,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was an amazing film in terms of what it did for the post-apocalyptic zombie genre.  The camera work, special effects, and of course modifications to the general zombie premise were all sheer genius.  However, I felt no particular attachment to the story, itself.  28 Weeks Later, however, uses the same premise and directing style to deliver something far more terrifying, thought-provoking, and generally powerful.

The film begins around the time of the first one, with a band of survivors, including a loving husband and wife, holed up in a boarded shack, trying to wait out the infestation.  As the infected inevitably break in, husband Don is forced to make a difficult decision.  After doing an impressive job of fending off the attackers, he tries to take his wife into hiding, but she chooses, instead, to run off and protect an innocent child.  As the infected swarm around her, she begs for Don to help her, but he knows (as well as we do) that she's done for.  He makes the hard decision and runs for it.  As he leaves the house, tearing across a sunny field with hundreds of infected chasing behind him, he looks back and sees his wife, still banging against the upstairs window, begging him to save her with accusing eyes.

Inevitably, these kinds of hard decisions come to frame the narrative of this story.  As London is eventually rebuilt and repopulated, and as Don is reunited with his lost children (all the while secretly enduring the guilt of his decision), a new infection breaks out, character after character is forced to make such tough decisions, and the writing team is realistically merciless with those who choose to play hero.  It's a tough, at times even cruel film where fate never intervenes to protect the good guys against improbable odds.  Still, the film never leaves you questioning what the right course of action is, even in spite of the consequences it will bring.

It's an amazingly powerful film for just such a reason, the kind that entertains and terrifies the heck out of you the entire time, yet leaves you with an amazing three hour discussion on ethics and altruism to ponder with friends afterward.

And please don't get the impression that, just because this is an intelligent, thoughtful film, it must therefore not be all that scary or action-intensive.  It's been a while since I saw the original 28 Days Later, but I'm reasonably sure this was far more intense.  Each ""scary"" scene seemed more intense than the one before, often using claustrophobia, darkness, and a highly unpredictable plot to keep me on the edge.

Speaking of the plot, I think that's probably the point that polarizes the lovers and haters of this film.  It takes nearly half the film for the outbreak to happen, and I can see why people looking for a mindless, action-packed horror flick would find that frustrating.  As it happens, I found that mostly bloodless first half to be thoughtful, rich in character and drama, and above all else, unpredictable.  It kept leaving me to wonder how things were finally going to go wrong.  Where was the surviving infection going to come from?  Indeed, once the blood starts splattering, the plot manages to stay somewhat unpredictable.  Many thing happened, especially toward the end, that I did not expect at all.

In the end, I think 28 Weeks Later's only problem is that it isn't a mindless adrenaline rush from start to finish.  The film asks you to think, feel and care, but this ultimately makes the scream-intensive second half far more thrilling than your standard fare.",1257033600,2,3560,4.814144736842105

I was extremely excited about this movie when it was first announced because one of my favorite actors ever Jeremy Renner. I have always liked him especially his performance in the great flick Dahmer. So when this first came out I was really excited but this did not turn out as great as I thought. Still the movie was fun and had a bit of that appeal that the first did although I think it was trying to hard to live up to the first. Renner definitely is what makes this movie for me, and once again they are infected not zombies.

The second film follows a some people who get stuck within an infected zone after an infected gets loose, the husband and wife. These people are being lead by a solider who feels sorry for them and disobeys orders and even shoots his fellow soldiers. They have to make it all the way across town to try to get a lift out of the quarantined zone. They have to out last a lot of infected, soldiers, napalm and all kinds of things. This one unlike the last film is a straight survival film were as the last was a mix of all kinds.

This movie seemed well directed and written for the most part but it seemed like they were trying to out do the last film more so than further the story. Don't get me wrong I love when the helicopter starts to chop away at the infected but did it feel a little like the studio was involved in stuff like that. To me the story seemed great at first but towards the last half it did not seem as developed. In fact the first half felt very much like the first film but it started to falter towards the end a little. Acting wise Jeremy Renner is brilliant but I was a little disappointed with the fate of his character, Robert Carlyle is also great in this.

I liked this second film and found it to be a fun flick but it did not seem as real as the first or even as fun. The story was good and the acting was good but it just fell a little short in my opinion. I would still recommend a purchase especially if you have the first one but a rental at least could be good for this one. Look for the two pack if you do not already own these because it is a good deal for the two films.",1255564800,2,2156,4.04215456674473

*Spoilers*

The tricky thing about sequels is that not only do they have to be good movies in their own right, but they also must weather the inevitable comparisons to the movie that it follows. And, fundamentally, this is the biggest problem with ""28 Weeks Later"". Following, as it does, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B0000BZJCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>, but with seemingly everyone who was involved with ""28 Days"" completely replaced, it was inevitable that the resulting sequel would have a largely different tone than the first movie. Whether or not this change is a bad thing will depend on the viewer's expectations.

""28 Weeks"" starts well enough - a group of survivors are holed up tight in a country house, far away from the cities and the rage virus. It's nice to see variety in a zombie movie, and the ensuing demonstration that frightening situations needn't be restricted to the dead of midnight is welcome. Viewers may reasonably question, however, why the otherwise apparently fairly prudent occupants of the house didn't take a few more steps to ensure their safety in this new, uncertain world - such as emigrating permanently to the second story, which seems to be more than roomy enough (shaky camera notwithstanding) and which - once isolated from the downstairs - would seem to be a permanent safe-haven from the rage victims, given that they aren't lucid enough to scale walls or build ladders.

While this may seem like a small point, I feel it neatly underlines the changed between ""Days"" and ""Weeks"". The survivors in ""Days"" were modern 'real' people - in other words, they'd seen a zombie movie or three (as have we all) and subsequently they knew how to protect themselves. Flats barred with impenetrable walls of shopping carts, iron doors, and suits of makeshift armor were the refuge of the besieged in the city. The army out in the country employed round-the-clock shifts, mine fields, and a very prudent once-bit-then-shot policy that prevented serious disaster when one of their own was infected. The point behind all this is that ""Days"" was not a zombie movie in the traditional sense, but rather a movie about human nature under stressful, end-of-the-world conditions. Realistically, you could have replaced all the zombies with, say, nuclear fallout and you still would have had the same haunting themes in ""Days"" - namely, where our humanity begins and ends in a struggle for survival.

""Weeks"", on the other hand, is pretty much a straight-up zombie movie, and in order to facilitate that, the humans have to be a lot less competent than they were in ""Days"". So we have desperate people failing to fall back to a secure upper story and a military with such poor security measures that it seems almost blind luck that they haven't been overrun yet. (Which isn't to say that ""Weeks"" doesn't attempt a point at military ethics, but the civilians-are-expendable message is so anvilicious compared to ""Days"" that it will likely annoy more than thoughtfully provoke.)

Once you accept ""Weeks"" as a straight-up zombie movie, it's not a bad one. There's a living MacGuffin that has to be tracked down, protected, and gotten to safety once the inevitable disaster overruns the safe haven. The biggest problem here, though, is that the build-up to the disaster is long and tedious, with quite a bit of dialogue that sounds like it was meant to be deep and meaningful, but just comes off as the filler dialogue we've all heard before. And once the dying starts, the characters die off so predictably that they might as well all be wearing numbered jerseys.

I guess you could say that I really loved ""28 Days"" because I went into the movie expecting a good, solid zombie flick, and I came out mentally shaken by the moral subtext and end-of-the-world break down of social relationships. But the downside to that meant that I went into ""28 Weeks"" expecting to be further mentally toyed with and was ultimately let down when the movie turned out to 'merely' be a decent, if predictable zombie flick. There's enough here to be interesting, mostly centering around the infected Typhoid Mary of the plot, but ultimately all that gets tossed down the drain in favor of running around in the dark getting eaten. And while there's nothing wrong with that, per se, ""28 Weeks"" doesn't end up standing out significantly from the hordes of similar movies on the market, in my opinion.

2902676,3,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was unique amongst ""zombie"" films (let's just use the word and not start the non-zombie argument for the time being) in that it held a certain amount of logic to it. It worked on several levels. So naturally when the sequel came out, I was supremely interested.
I probably could have saved myself the trouble and watched any ""millitary bad!"" movie out there, like say The Siege. This movie is nowhere near the quality of the original. The setup is great, and there's no arguing with the premise itself save for the way that the plague is reintroduced. However...
In 28 Days Later, when a character died it meant something. When you lost Frank, you cared for him and railed inwardly at his passing. In 28 Weeks, there's no real attachment to anyone. The deaths of multiple characters are basically senseless, no meaning to them nor do they add to the story. And I'm not talking the deaths of the incidental victims, that's a given for the genre. No, it's the deaths of the main characters and the supporting cast that causes such waste. It could have been violence committed on action figures with blowtorches and hammers, and it would have been the same impact.
And let's break for a moment to go into the colossal blunder that every director, filmmaker, and script writer in existence seems to make that assumes that in a disaster all military men go Apocalypse Now on everyone in their way. Oh yes, it's here alright. It's in full force...in fact, it's the drive behind the second half of the movie. It's cheap. I get tired of it. 28 Days had that same sin in force, but the movie was good enough I could forgive it.
Also, don't forget the rule that I don't think was touched on in any Scream movie: if you use night vision in a horror film, you die. And you get a first-person camera death to boot. It does not fail.
...
Alright, I'm back from my trip to Planet Rant.
Perhaps I should be fair, this is a different director and he has a completely different approach to things. 28 Days was very character and human driven in the end, this film is not.
Basically, this film is wasted potential. There are the gleanings of a good movie here, but the ingredients are not cooked well enough to make the overall dish satisfactory. The characters are not as strong, it relies more on tried and true movie tropes to run the action, everything is too ""pat"". No surprises, and none of the feel that makes 28 Days so special. Watch it, it's still alright, but don't expect what you saw in the previous movie.",1248566400,,2514,4.491266375545852
2902677,3,B000TJBN7Q,"The opening scene of this film immediately drew me in.  I found the scene in which Robert Carlyle decides to abandon his wife to save his own life utterly gut wrenching to watch.  I watch a lot of horror movies and am not easily shocked but for some reason a few scenes in the film really hit me.  I kept thinking of ""what if"" scenarios and how would I react in this situation.  Would I be humane or do what it takes to save myself just to survive.  The only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars from me is not because it wasn't a worth sucessor to the original but because of all of the little unbelievable details that seemed to happen throughout the movie.

Pros

+ Brutal opening and a few other tough scenes to watch, usually when the ""rage"" infected are attacking their victims.

+ Very few slow moments and since the infected move just as fast as every one else there's not the typical run, hide and wait for the zombies to get me.

+ The atmosphere of the film was very tense and I found myself tensing up several times without realizing it.

+ Gore and special effects were noteworthy.

Cons

- Story was rather transparent and not very believable.  Would they really let a population of 15,000 people settle in a recently infected but purged London?  They mentioned several times all other areas of the city were not safe.

- Jerky and grainy camera work.  Whether it was intentional or not it definitely is not for someone who would suffer from motion sickness.

- The ease of which the children escaped the military compound and get into the infected part of the city was laughable.

- The father (a janitor) who had an all access pass to the entire facility presses a lockdown button to prove a point to his kids without any reprecussions?

-  The infected but immune mother (who unbelievably survived) was left unguarded!  She possibly held the cure for the ""rage"" infection in her blood but she's left alone for the husband to find her and become reinfected, destroying the whole compound.

- The lone helicopter pilot was allowed to fly unchecked the entire film, even when military jets are firebombing the compound to destroy the infected.

- An infected father who even though he was infected by the ""rage"" was able to avoid being killed, firebombed and track his children to a subway station outside of the compound.

There are several plot holes that are never filled: how did the boy live for so long, and how did he know there were people inside the house? How did the wife live? I understand the genetic abnormality--that part is cool--but how did she make it out alive at all, with a house full of ragies, when very capable men can't seem to avoid being eaten and torn to shreds? Why did the father retain some personality traits/memories when no other rage victim had before? How did the ragies get to the snipers? You get the idea.

The writer/directors ought to have developed the genetic abnormality a little more, created smoother transitions, and relied less on all out gore. Of course, these are just my opinions.

2902682,2,B000TJBN7Q,"While I am not going to preach about how great the first movie was, I felt these sequel just messed up too much to be an enjoyable film. To keep it simple, i will just list the cons and pros of the film.

Pros:

1) The first 10 minutes were very cool, and set the movie up for an incredible story, unfortunately, they flopped it.

2) A couple scenes were cool, I enjoyed the helicopter scene, although that was just utter gorefest crap, that some people may feel takes away from the movie.

Cons:

1) They flopped it, the most interesting and dynamic characters got killed literally when the first zombie appears, and they throw out all character anything to start a mindless chase scene.

2) Breaking zombie lore. It is really bad when a squeal feels the need to break the zombie lore established in it's own movie. I am surprised noone has mentioned the fact that these zombies run around freely at daytime now. In 28 days, they avoided light and remained indoors during the daytime if they could help it, that is why the characters were so capable of moving around and you only saw infected indoors or in tunnels during the day. Every scene that had zombies outdoors occurred during sunset with the light fading. The other lore broken is the formation of the ""intelligent zombie"" that seemed to explicitly harass his loved ones and avoid the failsafes.

3) The sheer stupidity of it. So many things in this are just stupid, so stupid that it is unforgivable. For your convenience, I will list them now.
  -The women in quarantine is left completely unguarded, even after they realized she was infected. A Janitor is given open access to her door with his card (a quarantined area for infected). The then infected janitor, apparently quarantined areas have no cameras, manages to open the door to let himself out of quarantine (quarantine, mind you) and kill several armed guards who are completely incapable of shooting and killing him.
 -In response to this threat, the army shoves everyone into a single, dark, crowded room, cause naturally, placing everyone in a crowded room is the best thing to do when confronted with a highly contagious virus. A room, I might add with a back door that is unguarded and easily opened by a single infected.
 -The army begins opening fire on everyone to kill the virus. So insanely, in fact, that they target and kill people that are obviously not infected. The best example, of course, is when they open fire on a moving car. Cause naturally, there could be a zombie driving that car? Maybe I can understand the napalm and poison to stop the threat, but shooting someone who shouts, ""don't shoot I am not a zombie"" in an area with no zombies present, without making any attempt to extract them is idiocy.
 - Apparently, not only do legions of zombies managed to escape a quarantined area after a napalm raid, even though it only showed like 15 escaping, but they all have radar gps units in their heads even with all of London at their disposal and immediately run to the area the few surviving humans head to for pick up. Plus the ""intelligent"" zombie I mentioned earlier manages to track them perfectly, yet doesn't choose to attack at numerous opportunities.
 - In the stadium tunnel, the stairway leading down is apparently pitch black, yet there is plenty of light at the bottom of the stairs for them to navigate once they fall down the stairs and wonder out about 10 feet from it. Plus, after falling down the stairs in a pitch black environment, whose impulse would be to calmly wonder away, not panic and run, but just meander away before the only person that can see has a chance to find you.

Alright, after that, maybe you can see why I chose the score I did. I will grant it a 2 simply because of the potential, that under better hands, could have made this movie a great experience. At the moment the first zombie appeared. I muttered quite loudly, ""Oh my god, that is not the direction this movie is going"". Yet it was, they just tossed away the plot and started running from crazed gps infected, the end.",1237680000,11,4062,4.584827586206896

As much as I don't mind accents, I couldn't understand a word of what was being said unless it was the US troops speaking. I was also looking for some thread of a plot - no dice. The infected were about as scary as my Dachshund. I know that some folks think these two movies are cult classics like the Romero zombies, and to each his own.

2902704,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Sure there are a lot of fantastic horror movies out there from the Exorcist in the 70's to The Ring in the 2000's. But in my opinion this one tops them all! Why? Because it will scare the hell out of you!!! What I look for in a horror movie is not the acting, although it's not bad at all here. It has to do with not being too cheesey (unless it's a cult classic like Evil Dead II), has to have decent effects, it has to make you become somewhat involved in the characters so you feel for them, & it has to make you feel like you need a hallway light on when you are walking to the bathroom afterward.

I thought 28 Days Later (the prequel) was a great movie. Original & realistic story that seems to be copied more & more these days (biological warfare wipes out much of the population & leaves survivors vs themselves or zombies). It introduced a new kind of zombie that was fast as hell & who could infect you with blood to blood or by mixing internal fluids with yours. And the victims turned INSTANTLY. When the survivalist couple in the first one runs into the main survivor (Cillian Murphy) in the convenient store & the guy gets infected, the black woman hacks him up without hesitation. Her only companion to that point! No time to think about it. That was freakin brutal!

And that's what 28 Weeks Later brings. A group of survivors is sitting around having a quiet dinner when a group of zombies assends upon thier cottage & all hell breaks loose. Literally! Crank up the surround sound & tell me you don't jump out of your chair & start sweating. And the movie NEVER lets up from there! Fantastic movie. Don't root for anyone because they probably won't make it through to the end. This movie is insane & the subway scene is one of the scariest in a movie just by how it makes you feel when you think about it. You're in the complete dark & you hear people screaming all around you. People are changing & killing each other left & right. You just want to survive, to get to the light alive. But there is fear & panic all around you. That's what this whole movie is about. And the best zombie dismemberment ever with the helicopter scene!

If you love horror movies, or if you liked the first movie, or you just want to see a great suspenseful movie, or even if your a scardey cat just daring yourself to get through a tough movie..THIS ONE IS FOR YOU! 28 Months Later is supposed to hit theaters in 2010 or so.

Too bad the homely boy and his stupid sister weren't shot outright once they exited the perimeter and disobeyed the law.  So much disaster could have been avoided. It may not be all their fault however because these children came from very stupid gene stock.  Shortly after they returned with their infected mother, their uninfected father knowingly kissed (and exchanged infected saliva) with their infected mother and yes both mommy and daddy knew she was infected. These two got their just rewards.

The movie was OK except for the fact all the good guys were killed (including a hero military guy who stopped to help them) and these brats got away to spread it everywhere else which is more sickening than the disease.",1235433600,,754,4.8671875
2902706,3,B000TJBN7Q,"I love 28 Weeks Later, the continuation to 28 Days Later. Even with its MANY faults, I can't help but really like this movie.

28 Weeks Later starts off during the beginning of the outbreak. Six survivors are hiding out in a cottage, just trying to get by when all hell breaks lose. Honestly it's one of the most intense and amazing intros to a movie I've seen in awhile. There is one scene I can't get out of my head from 28 Days and that's the tunnel scene. One of the best scenes that I always remember from 28 Weeks is what I call the hill scene. When one of the survivors is high tailing it across a field and you see a mass of infected coming over a hill and flocking right to him. Man I love the intro. 28 weeks after the outbreak begins, and the infected have perished from starvation, the military begins to clean up Britain and try to repopulate it. They bring in people from outside (England was quarantined so everyone else was ok) to start their new lives here. A survivor is found later that's infected, but not like `the infected' were. And so begins our cute tale of horror.

As for movie itself, I really do like it, but like I said before there are so many faults with it. And it's mainly to make the movie scary or intense I guess. I'll give you an example. When the outbreak begins again (you know it's coming so I am not ruining anything), the military shoves everyone into one big room and then shuts the power off in the city and then turns on the emergency back up lights. Seriously? Why would you do this? That's the kind of thing this movie does a lot, just to add effect to it. It can get pretty eye-rolling for sure. But at the same time, I still can't help but enjoy the movie due to the fun it brings. Like the helicopter scene for instance. Once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. So cool.

In the end I would say give it a rent unless you just really like the series like me. I own it and love it but I'm still giving it 3 stars cause of the absurd things that happen.

2902710,5,B000TJBN7Q,"The prequel 28 Days Later was a horror masterpiece. Being a ""small"" movie in close quarters with limited ""infected"", it excelled at keeping the suspense up and frights absolutely terrifying. With 28 Weeks Later, the set is much larger expanding to all of London with at times thousands of infected. I was worried that this larger scale would turn this movie into more of an action horror and not living up to the first. I was totally wrong. This movie put a vice around me and held me down for the entire duration. Every scene is masterfully done. At times the suspense is in the background where I could see maybe something going wrong, but usually doesn't. At other times I had my fists and jaw clenched tightly as the horror unfolded. I often wanted the movie to end so I could get the hell out of there. The intensity is unbelievable. The gore is usually brief but brutal.

I shouldn't have wasted my time.  With a different director and different characters, ""28 Weeks Later"" is just another zombie movie.  It's predictable, slow and uninteresting.

2902724,4,B000TJBN7Q,"""28 Weeks Later"" starts in the same time frame of ""28 Days Later"", and ends much further. Danny Boyle did an excellent job on the first, but he's not directing this time around Juan Fresnadillo is the main man now. The movie feels very different from the first film, being a die hard fan of the first film I was ready to be over critical.

Luckily the intro stirred up the same feeling received from the climactic parts of the original. After that the movie really shifts away from those ideals, and revolves more on a different approach of survival. While the rage infected civilians still play a prime role, the military becomes just as terrifying (and much more destructive). Instead of just waves of zombie like people, now explosions and helicopters make way. Snipers and turrets, fire fights, and military bases, hmmmm.

Sounds a bit more like an action film huh? Indeed it is, but it adds variety to the universe. The action does seem a bit over the top at some points, but the horror still feels just as real and intense as ever.
One will notice a larger budget was enabled this time, and they make sure to use it to its fullest.

Story wise, the objective is much clearer then the first. Yet after the initial break out, the story takes back seat to simply surviving. 28 Days focused more on rationing and slow paced moving about. This one is breakneck speed, for if they shall halt death is imminent. This really helps the film from becoming stagnant, the way it plays out slow moments will only hinder it. I personally liked the original story more, with the initial group of survivors confused and struggling on reaching salvation. It kept us wondering where would be safe, are they just stuck wandering?  Gravitating us to feel their confusion and disbelief. 28 Weeks is less dynamic as it maintains a certain adrenaline rush spanning the entire course of the film. The music is still prominent, and knows when to cue the 'buddy hug the side of your seat, it's gonna' get creepy'.

Summarizing the story, England is deemed safe to relocate to. Precautions are taken direly. The U.S. military provides consistent steak outs. Upon being dubbed safe to live in again, a civilian quarters is established. Ruins of Englands apocalyptic nightmare still strain on, all around lay blood drenched buildings. Vacant stores and vehicles residing on the streets empty as can be.  A  father reunites with his children. Children are still not allowed, but exceptions are made. Without spoiling how, an infection resurfaces. Cures have been something parallel to a dream, but recent study suggest it may be possible. With the infection virally spreading faster then wild fire, U.S. forces must cleanse the area by all means.

What I really enjoyed about this film is although it takes place in a further time, you actually get to watch a breakout start. 28 Days, the protagonist awoke in a daze much after the course of the epidemic, and slowly saw it cease. A second sequel seems less trivial and more a  necessity. A third title is set to take place in Russia. The 28 series is refreshing, chaotic, and very gory. Bonus features include comics, commentary, and a few behind the scenes look at the making of.

Side note, rage virus is not a zombie making mayhem. These 'zombie' like humans are fast, lethal, and blindingly angry. Infection can spread via bite, or any blood entering an open surface. Once infected, transformation is fast.

28 weeks is an impressive sequel, that avoids treading the same territory twice. A film worth the while of viewing, and hopefully good enough to get viewers into the first film (if they haven't seen it already).",1226275200,,3650,4.7594936708860756
2902725,1,B000TJBN7Q,"This is the sequel to 28 days later, and I thought it was pretty weak. An entirely predictable plot from start to finish, featuring annoyingly silly teenage protagonists, their dad, and a group of somewhat dim NATO soldiers. I was disappointed because the first film was well done, had an interesting plot and was surprising. This film the children take over with their TSTL (too stupid to live) antics, and the plot devolves into horror/slasher formula. The moment the children arrived in the military zone I predicted they'd do something really moronic. I was disappointed to be right.

I enabled close captions, which was convenient when I fast forwarded all the chase scenes that the director apparently considered plot development. This way  I could read the sparse dialog without feeling the need to slow down.

The ending was almost the only interesting part of the film. Perhaps a sequel would be better.

Overall? I give this one a star. It was barely watchable and boring in its banality.",1225411200,4,998,4.9226190476190474

This ultraviolent film is superior to the first, which had a very lackluster ending.  The vision of director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and co-writers Rowan Joffe, E.L. Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo is bleak, uncompromising, and even heart-breaking.  There are many sympathetic characters, but every act of tenderness results in disaster, resulting in a world where humanity's better nature actually works against it, possibly resulting in its ultimate destruction.

[Note:  Some spoilers follow.]  I never figured out why the people infected with the rage virus never attack each other rather than concentrating exclusively on the uninfected.  Given they are so whacked out as to not be able to even feed themselves -- we are told that everyone infected the first time around is dead of starvation -- how are they able to resist going after each other?  Another point:  Would the authorities really be intent on repopulating London so soon after the infection?  If they were, shouldn't they have done a better job of guarding the ways into and out of the ""green zone""?  Why have armed guards posted every two feet inside the quarantined area and then have few guards at the entrances?  The two kids have no trouble sneaking out, so you would expect the infected would have had little trouble breaking in.  And given how important the infected -- but asymptomatic -- mother is, why wouldn't she be guarded more closely?  The father is able to visit her without much trouble.  They have all these guards everywhere and then when they have an infected person on their hands, they don't bother to guard her closely?  A few implausible things are bound to occur in any sci-fi movie, but when the writers get this sloppy it seriously detracts from enjoying the film.",1222732800,3,1490,4.61596958174905
2902730,1,B000TJBN7Q,"I'm an old hand at horror movies. I've watched them for a long time, and seen lots of them. I like intelligent horror, not the ""let's spend the whole budget on tubs of blood and guts from a slaughter house"" horror.

I loved the original 28 Days Later. I loved all the possible endings they had shot for 28 Days later (well, the story board idea sucked). It made me think, and even made me rethink my view or irradiated fruits :D

28 Weeks Later sucked. No thought was involved I the movie at all. Just sit back and watch people scream and run for the red colored corn syrup. Ants must have thanked their ant god for all the food the props department provided them. The trees of the world must have breathed a sigh of relief that almost none of them were cut down to be script paper.

The story is inconsistent. In the first movie we're told that animals DO get the Rage infection (hence the animal to human transfer). In 28 Weeks Later, they say animals CAN'T get the infection. Two children are flown from the safety of Spain to the quarantined London. What part of QUARENTINE is not understood? What father would have his children flown into that special hell? Sure, the mother has an immunity to the infection - how does that explain her not being a meal for all those infected people in the house?

Largely this feels like a bunch of people sat around and said ""Hey, we could do a shoot in this location, what sort of zombie attack would look cool there?. There seems to have been no thought put into telling a coherent story in between the attacks.

This sequel was so bad I'll avoid anything more from this soon-to-be trilogy. If I could have the memory of 28 Weeks Later wiped from my mind, I would.",1222646400,11,1706,4.352201257861635

Of course things don't go well, and there's a lot of sprinting away from the bad guys.  The movie's pace is very quick and it's over before you know it.

2902732,3,B000TJBN7Q,"""28 Weeks Later"" picks up where ""28 Days Later"" left off.  The virus that's been turning ordinary human beings into flesh-eating zombies has apparently run its course, the infected humans have all died of starvation, and Britain is slowly being repopulated with many of the citizens who fled the scene at the start of the epidemic.  One of those returnees is Don (played by Robert Carlyle), who is suffering from survivor's guilt after leaving his wife in a moment of panic to be devoured by the creatures.  Or was she?  Suffice it to say, it's hard to keep a good virus down and soon London is in the grip of a major new outbreak of the illness.  Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Imogen Poots and MacKintosh Muggleton (what a great name!) play various characters who spend the bulk of the movie running for their lives from the menace.

Zombie pictures have become such a staple of the horror movie genre that it is hard for anyone to do anything particularly novel or original with them anymore.  Zombie bites human, human turns into zombie, new zombie bites another human, and on it goes ad infinitum.  That scenario may have been fresh and exciting when George Romero first introduced it to the world in ""Night of the Living Dead"" back in 1968, but it has been diluted through repetition and overuse ever since (partly by Romero himself with his endless, ever diminishing variations on the theme).  The one innovation the original ""28 Days Later"" came up with was to speed up the zombies' movements so that they were no longer the lumbering creatures that anyone's 85-year-old granny could easily outrun.

""28 Weeks Later"" has some genuinely suspenseful moments and a nice post-apocalyptic feel in its early stretches, but, like its predecessor, it tends to devolve into a tedious shooting-gallery sideshow the longer it goes on.  Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's hurdy-gurdy filmmaking style, which is intended to replicate the chaos and pandemonium of the situation, often leads more to confusion than to clarification for the audience.  Still, the movie contains a few cool plot twists and raises some thorny ethical issues, such as whether or not innocent people are to be sacrificed if that means ensuring the safety of the population as a whole.  And there is certainly more than enough bloodshed and general mayhem to keep the zombiephiles among us rooted to our seats.  Even the undead can have fun with that.",1218240000,,2417,4.8777506112469435
2902733,3,B000TJBN7Q,"Zombie movie, zombie movie, zombie movie. If that's your cup of tea, this is Darjeeling.  It has all the expected ingredients, and is aimed to please. Halfway through the film, some similarities to the situation in ""Aliens"" occurred to me, but ""Aliens"" was a great film with themes and acting that transcended horror. This movie is just ""aim to please,"" and that's about all, but done with a good budget. As in most standard horror films, there are characters who commit some stupid, and often selfish, acts, leading to the usual sense of overwhelming annoyance in the viewer. Isn't it funny that the main ingredients in standard horror films is a sense of overwhelming annoyance, overwhelming anticipation, and overwhelming terror? ""28 Weeks Later"" will serve up large, satisfying proportions of all three for all the zombie ravenous out there. Eat it up and keep your heart pumping for the next coming feast.

""28 Weeks Later"" is a successful follow-up to ""28 Days Later"", even though I rarely like sequels. It is a different movie with different character motivations. I really like the way Robert Carlyle's character haunts the film. I won't be a spoiler, but the end is as chilling as it is slightly confusing.

2902755,3,B000TJBN7Q,"There's always that extra obstacle to conquer when making sequels, for the lovers of the first movie the second needs a reason to exist, it has to be real, strong and carry the story further than one could have imagined. I really enjoyed ""28 Days Later"" because I got to see it in a half empty theater with a friend, and it felt so real and brutal that I walked out with my knees shaking. Then I saw this movie at home and while it still made me cringe I don't think that it was the lack of super sized screen that made the movie feel smaller than the first, somehow as good as it was there were flaws to it that made it hard for me to give it more stars.

Overall I'm glad I saw it, it was scary, bloody, gross, there was lots of close run ins and plenty of super hungry, super fast infected zombies but the little things that allowed the outbreak spread again made me shake my head in disbelief. At one point I was laughing (the scene in the dark at the stadium escalator) because it was so ridiculous and then I was flabbergasted at the bad decisions, like the new kids who arrived at the cleaned now London sneaked out to get something from their old home even thought it was forbidden to leave, they simply took this dramatic stance against everyone's safety as they opened the portals to hell for everyone else. I was surprised to see who was the main carrier of the virus and then who spread it to everyone else, I know the zombies were fast but the so called safe army guarded compound was like kindergarten during an Easter egg hunt, the infected ravaged anyone they pleased and it seemed that even all those weapons and precautions didn't do much to stop the spread.

The movie looked good, I liked the eerie and forlorn mood and it was a good chunk of horror watching on a rainy Sunday but the little bits of stupidity that well, allowed for the sequel to exist were little too much. At the end it left me feeling depressed, so I guess goal accomplished! Not bad but not the greatest although worth the watch for horror fans.

2902756,1,B000TJBN7Q,"I love this type of theme that are based on ""The End of the World"", but I hate this type of directors modality that they try to impress the viewers by making almost 90% of the movie on close ups scenes.

I think they think that the viewer will imagine what is going on, but when I seat there to watch a movie I want to see what is going on and have good views of the whole scene; I want to see the big picture not everything so close that you opt to press fast forward to move on.

Yes! I was one of those; I did press fast forward because the scene tends to produce me some vertigo when this director shouted all scenes like close ups ones!!!

Almost 90% were that close to the face of people or to the fight that you don't understand what is happening for sure, you only know is a fight or a chase.

I am not sure if you understand me, in simple words, all scenes of chasing and all fights were so close that one can't figure out what is going on precisely.

In my opinion is a bad movie!

THE STORY
When someone says 'one person can change the world' noone usually believes them, however Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo proves this theory with his amazingly executed extreme, 28 Weeks Later.

While Danny Boyle's landmark film 28 Days Later focused on an individual trying to comprehend and outlast the infection that razed his familiar world, 28 Weeks drops us straight into what we were also secretively waiting to experience--the cycle of the virus' mobility throughout England entire.

Fresnadillo starts intimately in space and character development as we meet Don and Alice in a darkened center of a nuclear family's world: the kitchen. There's a short but sensible glimpse into the hearts of this couple, from parental concerns about their children abroad in Spain to a warm moment of a kiss that's interrupted by one of the owners of the home, illustrating the very sparse opportunities of normalcy that the characters will encounter. The situation's scope instantly spirals outward to convey more survivors are living with them, that the world of the film itself is bigger than the region of 28 Days, until the infected descend upon them leaving Don to face a devastating choice.

While the virus creates obvious differences between the populations, both groups manage to find a common ground in behavior: each Infected and Survivor acts like an injured animal, chewing off the dormant parts of itself that renders it helpless in its pursuit to survive. We experience the chilling, full range of all expectations being annihilated, from the personal to national level: protectors betray the trust of those who depend on them, facets of `family' are torn to shreds (from the literal nuclear family to the military and finally, the nation) with a disturbing erasure of the hope -- or arrogance -- that something can be extinguished with a desperate affirmation and will, rather than concede that its enemy might have a will of its own.

The final coda of the film is out-and-out terrifying as the virus becomes all the Rage in Paris...

This `Survival of The Fittest' story, and the true power behind the idea of 28 Days, lies in the brutal frankness of human reaction and our natural baser instinct of survival being tested within the phenomenon of an epidemic. It's impossible to walk away from this film without honestly appreciating how plausible it all actually is.

THE REVIEW
Image/Sound
The eyes are the keynote to 28 Weeks, and Fresnadillo consistently amplified this concept by creating the film through the perspectives of its characters -- his methodology of handheld cameras gives us a wonderfully natural flavor with the edgy, frantic realism of a documentary, and recaptures the speed and chaos of Boyle's innovative film. He also gives us moments to breathe along with the characters utilizing the calming movements of stationary camerawork in placid, yet emotional, moments.

The DVD preserves his vast scope and barren landscapes that the characters have to move through, with slow, broad sweeps that are instantly unnerving as we find London so inconceivably empty, and similarly his every close up stings with impact (a favorite case in point: as Don apologizes to his children for the loss of their mother, we suddenly cut to the look on Alice's face the last time he saw her; not from that desperate plea in her eyes as she screamed for him, but from his perspective of how she must have felt about him, or how he thinks she should feel--a cold, dark hatred that fills the screen before the picture snaps to black. Also emphasized are, (Director of Photography) Enrique Chediak's ingenious strategy of almost-too bright, too-white edges around the colors that seems to replicate a viewpoint experiencing full-bodied fear during the chase and attack scenes, along with the comfortless shadows of the outside world the characters are trapped in during their internment within the ""safety"" of the Zone. Chediak's eerie vision behind London's `twilight' puts the final insinuating touch on England's fate in the film.

The sound quality holds every snarl, scream and explosion in crystal clear resonance, but best of all John Murphy's primal scoring also makes its return, almost as another character, with its distressing essence of intensity and precise despair.

Extras Code Red: The Making of 28 Weeks Later is an entertaining look inside of the film's creation and the determination to avoid the popular trap of rehashing the same ideas, instead expanding on the intriguing journeys Boyle suggested with the close of 28 Days. There's an interesting interview highlighting Boyle's continued captivation with the circumstance of an actual outbreak (and hopefully he will maintain his thoughtful decision to wait until there's really great story behind the plan of creating another development as his did with this one), as well as extending a sincere pleasure (that we as an audience can certainly appreciate) in handing his concept off to Fresnadillo; Robert Carlyle's laidback interview on creating his character, Don, is almost surreal while it's flanked with footage of his on-screen rampages. Fresnadillo also describes a pact that he made with Carlyle for Don's final scene with Alice: to bring the full weight of his rage against the small containment set where they were filming, and Carlyle obliged with an amazingly feral madness, having literally slammed his head into walls and doors over and over enough to sustain headaches for three days afterwards to give the audience a pure version of the transformation experience. The Director's Commentary, is an impressive insight into the talent and endurance of the filmmakers and crew, with production details that make it a film student`s dream blueprint on how to create an effective horror film.

Future filmmakers, please take notes.

This sequel is not bad, but the U.S. Army intervention just gave it a Hollywood-feel (with lousy action scenes such as the helicopter massacre, and way much more blood) which you wouldn't expect after watching the first one, and in my opinion wasn't necessary. Other than that, I liked it. It was original how the virus came back, although the ending was a bit predictable, I swear I knew which city would be next. Anyway it leaves you wanting yet another sequel!",1212192000,2,530,4.53125
2902785,3,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later is my favorite horror movie of all time, so when I first heard that a sequel was shooting, I was ecstatic.  Then, as news trickled in, I became more and more wary of the project.  None of the original actors were on board, nor was Danny Boyle slated to be the director.  I learned that the storyline focused on a boy, and being the mother of a young boy, this movie became something I thought that would definitely not want to see.  But, then, the movie was released.  My friends and trusted horror-advisors at horror-movies.ca began raving about the greatest movie of the year.  Even months later, board members were still proclaiming this their favorite film of 2007.  So, once it came to DVD, I decided to break down and watch it.  After all, could I call myself a fan of the first and refuse to see the sequel, 28 Weeks Later?  I thought not.

I would like to say that I loved the movie, but I can't.  I liked it.  I'll watch it again.  But did I enjoy it more than other 2007 releases?  No.  I even had a better ride on The Transformers.  And I hardly ever enjoy action-adventure flicks.  My best guess is that I came into 28 Weeks Later expecting to be thrilled and disappointed.  In equal parts.  This impossible equation almost always leads to disappointment.  This is an esoteric criticism, but I also have details to support my displeasure.

The biggest problem with 28 Weeks Later was the flow of the story.  Being a sequel of a hugely successful movie buys the right to jump right into the action, however, viewers were thrust into a house full of strangers.  The only familiarity was what was going on outside, with the Rage Infected crazies creating havoc.  I tried to get to know these people, I wanted to find a compassionate character in the mother, but it was difficult to care with so little background.  When the next phase of the film begins, 28 weeks later, we meet the children of the fated couple, and are more smoothly drawn into their situation.  They are, after all, kids, the youngest in new Britain, so you want them to survive and anxiously await the resurfacing of the infection that will endanger them.

The action was awesome, as were the effects.  I absolutely adore the savages, their eyes filled with blood and fury.  They are so scary and so dangerous, and the scene where the infection spreads through a confined group like wildfire heightens the excitement and urgency in a way that wasn't exposed in 28 Days Later.  The music also recalled the original movie in a positive way, showing the isolation of the characters who were trying so hard to cleave together and to survive.

The plot seemed to jump along.  The military doctor and the sniper were meant to be sympathetic saviors, but their motives didn't move me (even though they might have had they been better defined), and then there was the huge problem of the father's constant return.  The little group of survivors was moving around by foot and car, through all kinds of destruction, and that darned Dad just kept showing up.  It was too unbelievable, as was the plot culmination.  The movie came to an abrupt end, and left me quite unsatisfied.

28 Weeks Later is an example of one of those movies whose separate parts (cinematography, effects, soundtrack, etc.) are exhilarating, but without that strength of plot, falls short.",1209772800,,3344,4.6179966044142615
2902786,5,B000TJBN7Q,"I am sometimes a little iffy when it comes to naughty movies. My Christian friends, the most devout among them, are always cautioning me against indulging in what they call the ""devil's work"".  A gory scarefest like ""28 Weeks Later"" qualifies, at least in their eyes.

But as you regular readers know, I have a checkered past and have run with some pretty hedonistic crowds in my day.  I had to keep it a secret from my church group that I watched ""28 Days Later"" - which wasn't hard because as a rather blatant amalgam of many superior movies, I was underwhelmed.  Though at least we got a brief glimpse of Cillian Murphy's pee pee.  No such luck with Robert Carlyle in the sequel.  But in every other department this sequel outdoes the original.

This was definitely a slow-builder but once it got going, it didn't let up until the end.  It's only 90 minutes long, but feels more like 50 minutes given that the chills and thrills come fast and steady.  Not for the very squeamish.",1209340800,,982,4.502824858757062
2902787,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Having panned the unhorrific 28 DAYS LATER, I don't know what possessed me to record this sequel on my DVR and watch it. But, I'm glad that I did. I thought the original was a dull character driven rip-off of George Romero's Horror Classic DAY OF THE DEAD with almost NO horror to be seen anywhere up on the screen.

I'm thrilled to say that this Post Apocalyptic Spin-off literally trounces 28 DAYS LATER in terms of doomsday atmosphere, suspense, frights, and gory thrills. There are moments in this film that had me jumping off my couch. Not an easy task to accomplish. Excellent job.

MINOR SPOILER: Suffice it to say, there are minor quibbles with the plot. These kind of films are never perfect in suspending disbelief. I won't go into the plot of this ""stand alone"" story. (Read other reviews for that, this is for those that saw the film.) But, I was eagerly anticipating a bloody ignominious end to some of the protagonists in this film. Usually, any character that causes untold pain and suffering upon the rest of the cast is dispatched in due course in a horror film. I don't know if the filmmakers purposely had me wishing for their demise or it was entirely a ""happy accident"" (an unintended accident that helps a film). It certainly made sympathy for the protagonists more precarious.

Even though the ending didn't hand me the desired result, any horror film that frightens me, and gets me THAT worked up over the circumstances of its lead characters gets my FIVE STAR rating every time.

Some of the images of horror, desolation, and devastation are some of the best I've ever seen in this genre and stayed with me long after my initial viewing. TERRIFIC! Kudos to the Special Effects team and the director, Fresnadillo. Along with Rodriguez' superbly comic PLANET TERROR, Latino directors seem to be making the best films in this genre at the moment. I hope that they become a serious voice in Horror like their Italian cousins. Here's to more great Horror films, guys. I'm impressed.

I may have loathed the first film, but I'm a serious FAN of this sequel. The blurb on the box is absolutely wrong. It's MUCH MUCH ""better than the original."" By a bloody mile!

This is a FUN, FRIGHTENING, and SUSPENSEFUL HORROR CLASSIC! And a much better addition to the genre than its lackluster mother. I hope this series takes us further to the VERY EDGE of Survival Horror, much like The RESIDENT EVIL series is doing. Mon Dieu, I can't wait for the sequel!

2902789,3,B000TJBN7Q,"I had mixed feelings with this movie.

The first 40 minutes or so was nothing but one clumsy (and confusing) segment after another.  The scene involving a man running to his boat while these fast-paced zombie-like creatures chased after him was more confusing to watch than it should have been.  There was so many unnecessary rapid movements in the camera shots that I could barely tell what was going on.  After all the fast-moving shots were over, you then saw that the man finally escaped on the boat and was free.  It was really awkward.  Sometimes action scenes can move TOO fast, and this is a great example of that.

After the 40 minutes of boredom in the beginning was over, the story finally became to pick up (and so did the action scenes).  From there, the virus that was infecting the people and making them go crazy began to become the main focal point of the story.  The actual virus was disgusting to witness, with the people quickly shooting blood all over the place as they banged their heads repeatedly against the walls.  Quite unrealistic though, and just exciting for the violence only.

This resulted in these snipers who were on top of buildings at nighttime aiming directly for the kill shots to eliminate the creatures, and therefore, getting rid of the virus and preventing it from spreading.  This was the most interesting part of the entire movie.  Actually, just the fact the snipers were so accurate with their shots was pretty scary itself!

None of the storytelling aspects were interesting that involved any of the main characters.  The older girl and the younger boy were both pretty forgettable.  Overall, just a decent movie for people who want to see these new and improved deadly zombies that can move as quickly as people can, and just an alright movie and nothing more.",1209168000,,1809,4.731629392971246

The story picks up 6 mouths after the first outbreak, the U.S. goverment is trying to rebuild England soon a surviour enters district 1 unknow to her that she carrys the virus and all hell breaks lose again.
The acting is very good in this film, it might take a while for the action to kick in, but when it does it grabs you by the balls and does not let got untill the end, some of the violence can be too much for some, but this is a zombie film and you're going to get lots of blood. So in short 28 Weeks Later is one of a very few zombies flick that gives George Romero's zombies a run for it's money, A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!",1208563200,2,1042,4.014423076923077

2902792,3,B000TJBN7Q,"If the first film took its theme to be the collective inheritance of a militaristic and violent culture, this film is about the effects upon a family of personal guilt.  But the theme is pounded in a bit too strongly by a series of coincidences and implausible developments, especially when one of the zombies (I mean ""infected"") develops a personal vendetta and somehow seems to already be waiting for the main characters everywhere they happen to decide to go.

Part of the appeal of the first film was that once the sci-fi/horror premise was established events unfolded very realistically and unpredictably.  In this film events seem clearly designed to fulfill a symbolic role in the working out of one man's attempt to run from the past, and of the effects of this evasion upon his family.

The basic premise of the film seemed intriguing to begin with, and the opening scene was quite strong: in an act of cowardice and self-preservation a man abandons his wife to the advancing hordes of infected; this situation raises interesting questions and sets up an intriguing conflict at the heart of the film: now that he has survived how can he live with himself, and how can he face his children, who will not understand the fear that led him to such a dreadful decision?  28 Weeks Later everything looks to be under control and the survivors in London are being ""protected"" by American soldiers, against the possibility that the virus might still exist -- but of course it does or we wouldn't have a movie.

Apart from the story I also found the execution of this film to be lacking.  It is obviously a bigger film than the first, with a bigger budget -- spent mostly on military action and explosions and a bigger vision of an empty and desolate London -- but this one lacks the inventiveness of the first film.  What was fresh in 28 Days Later feels gimmicky here -- okay, the zombies  can run, but does that mean that they must always be running?  Can't they ever slow down and give us time to look at the action?  The video documentary style footage here also seems just like a less effective duplicate of the style of the first one, and not so much an exciting new look -- and the frenetic editing of the zombie attacks and killings doesn't feel inventive but overdone and done to death.  It sounds odd, but after several bouts of kinetic mayhem with sprinting dead I began to find it quite boring and repetitive -- and that definitely wasn't my experience with the first film, where I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (both in the theater and when I brought it home on dvd).  The first film I would recommend to anyone who likes film (and doesn't mind a bit of blood and gore and zombie violence).

2902805,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I just wonder where this particular franchise is headed... The first movie was a refreshing change of pace in the zombie genre. Yes, I said zombies, even though they weren't undead.

I honestly didn't know what to expect when I first watched the movie, and I wasn't at all disappointed. Of course, when I learned that a sequel was in the works, I was both apprehensive and excited to see what they were going to do with it.

Well, I can say this about the movie... it was very intense. It's not often that I watch a movie and end up coming out of it with a tension headache. But I did when I saw this in the theatre. Sadly, it doesn't translate so well to the small screen.

I won't post any spoilers, so don't fret.

As I said above, 28 Weeks Later is a zombie horror movie, make no mistakes about it. We all know the basic premise behind it. A virus infects people in seconds, making them homicidal. It spreads like wildfire... it takes only one infected to start a catastrophic cascade that grows exponentially.

Six months after the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, Britain has been declared safe, as those who were infected starved to death, and the long difficult process of repopulating London begins.

This movie deals with loss, the will to survive, and sacrifice. The truly frightening aspect of this movie is just what we would do in order to survive. The need to survive does tend to strip away the very basics of civilization in all of us.

It is a horror movie, to be certain, but not in the blood and guts aspect of horror (however, be warned, there is plenty of that if you're into that sort of thing), but instead in the horror of decisions that are made.

28 weeks later has all these elements. We make decisions that we have to live with every day, but this movie takes those decisions to the extreme.

A social commentary? Eh, I don't think so, not like what we've seen in the past. Maybe others might see it as such, but I didn't.

Sequels need to bring something new to the screen, to the canon of the franchise. 28 Weeks Later does so, in a very heart-rending way. Not literally, of course, but emotionally.

And, as one would fully expect, it has been left open for a sequel. Although at the time of this review, that is in jeopardy because it didn't do all that well in the theatre. Then again, there have been dozens of movies that did poorly at the box office and were granted a sequel.

Visually, it was quite stunning. The combat, without giving away any spoilers, was well done. The gore was sickeningly realistic (the one aspect that I didn't like about the movie), and the acting was believable.

I was very pleased to see that Robert Carlyle had a role in the movie, and his role was pulled off beautifully.

As I stated above, I still after all these months vividly remember even after an hour since  I had left the theatre, my heart was still pounding from the intensity of the movie, and it left me with one hell of a tension headache.

Even now, I can honestly say that I didn't find it scary, but it was one viscerally intense film. Others might find it scary, and I wouldn't recommend allowing younger teens to watch it.

My son, who has been getting into the zombie genre, still can't watch it, as the opening sequence because scared the hell out of him. Go figure, he had no problems watching the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Go figure.

The DVD has several special features, including two featurettes, entitled Code Red: The making of 28 Weeks later, & Getting into the action.

For those of you like me who love deleted or extended scenes, there are two available, running approximately five minutes in length, with an optional commentary tract (although I don't know why someone wouldn't watch it with the commentary on).

Finally, there are two digital issues from the 28 Days later: The Aftermath comic that's a must for any fan of the original movie. It acts as a bridge between the first and second movie. After reading the first two issues, I'm probably going to go out and find out if it's available in a graphic novel format.

Overall, it's an excellent way to spend a couple of hours, even if it can get exceptionally bloody at times.

2902806,3,B000TJBN7Q,"The deadly virus ""Rage"" comes back in ""28 Weeks Later,"" much-awaited sequel to the hit Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later."" Though the basic rules of the film's world - zombies running wild, for example - are the same, the sequel has more actions including shootings, explosions and zombie attacks. The film has many plot holes and shaky camera works (and very shaky at time), but it is entertaining nonetheless.

After the film's intense opening chapters, ""28 Weeks Later"" shows us the deserted city of London, where a certain area is now a secure zone for the military and residents. Selected civilians are allowed to return to England and they are informed (by the US army) that the disease is now contained. Of course it is, until someone, or some people, does things that they should not do.

Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack appear (and they are both very good), but their screen time is comparatively limited. The real stars are no doubt the undead. The zombie attacks have become more fierce and gory this time.

The action-packed sequel is helmed by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose unique thriller ""Intacto"" impressed me with its original story. Unfortunately, despite its merits (like terrific opening, impressive shots of the city's landmarks, etc.), ""28 Weeks Later"" sometime needs better plot devices than what they offer to convince us. I know we should forget such questions as ""How can he or she do this or that?"" while watching films - any films - but I think ""28 Weeks Later"" demands too much.

Or perhaps I didn't like these two kids, whose actions play an important role in the plot. Here is a new perspective Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has introduced into the overcrowding genre of zombie films. What you do for love does not necessarily mean a good thing. Well, that is the only way I can think of to account for their presence. Or perhaps the script is not that deep and that new viewpoint is just accidental. I don't know.

2902808,4,B000TJBN7Q,"It goes without saying that most good zombie flicks splatter blood by the gallon (""Cronos"" being a notable exception).  ""28 Weeks Later,"" sequel to the breakout smash ""28 Days Later"" follows that rule with gusto, but the movie emerges as a surprisingly thoughtful-yet-action-packed entry into a crowded genre.

Helmed by relative newcomer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo - a hot young talent from Spain - ""28 Weeks Later"" stays true with what worked in the first movie- realistic yet gory violence capped only by virtuoso special effects showing a London decimated by the zombie horde.  The ""ragers"" unleashed in the first movie are up to their old tricks, running down anyone with a pulse and ""converting"" them into ragers (or lunch) through bodily fluids and nasty bites.  A terrifying opening sequence sees our ""hero,"" Don (Robert Carlyle of ""Full Monty"" fame) abandon his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack of ""Dangerous Beauty"") to be mauled by the ragers.  He barely escapes with his life back to safety - London ruled by the U.S. Army.

But the city ain't safe for long.  Alice shows up from beyond the grave, and she's a ""carrier"" of the rage virus.  Before long (and I don't think I'm giving anything away here, since the ads show the ragers taking over London) there's another outbreak.  An intrepid band of survivors must get to safety.  But where is it?

One of the strengths of this movie is that nobody is safe - often a character will get identified as a ""safe hero"" whom you think will survive all the carnage, only to get offed in spectacular fashion.  The result is a terrifying, edge-of-your-seat movie.  A bare-bones plot - survive - adds to the terror, as does the quip-free dialogue.  This is a strong, intelligent movie, not a clever, hip one that will be dated six weeks after release.  And the movie is mercifully free of gratuitous sex and shower scenes - this is a movie that focuses on the frightening, not the titilation.

If you're a fan of horror films, you've probably already seen this movie.  If not, get ""28 Days Later"" first - you'll need the limited back story to really appreciate this movie.  The DVD extras are also well-worth the investment.

Not a Great Movie, by any means, but a darn good one.  Check it out.",1203897600,2,2241,4.741602067183463
2902809,1,B000TJBN7Q,"Wow. How to describe this piece of plot poo. Oh wait, I just did. Yes, it's a zombie flick, but if you go through the trouble to a) show the military presence in setting up the London reconstruction, and b) demonstrate the overwhelming security activity of all aspects of life, which c) ties into London's reputation as the most camera-happy city in the world, then how do two kids sneak out of the city unopposed? And people, they cross a BRIDGE, one of only two ways into ""the green zone."" This is how the story kicks off, and it's downhill from there. In a city destroyed by slobbering zombies, the first ""carrier"" is found - and they leave this woman alone and unguarded. She's carrying the friggin' virus that has killed millions of people. The plot holes in this are so huge they defy description, the least of which not being that this ""carrier"" caught the disease from zombies that eat every person they see -- except, of course, the carrier. Guess she was just a light snack, the one aberration in a consistent behavior of eating everything.

This installment begins with a truly outstanding opening sequence, one of the most intense scenes in modern horror history, no doubt.  After that, the film becomes an exercise in saying, ""Oh please, that would never happen!""  Yeah, suspension of disbelief is required for this movie, which is ok by me because it's just a movie, but the implausibility will surely turn off several fans of the original (as several reviews here on Amazon seem to suggest).  And while the characters in this film are cool, we hardly get to know them and thus it's a little more difficult to care about what happens to them as opposed to the characters in part 1.

2. the U.S. military leaving a high priority target like the only infected person in the world with absolutely no guard when they can spare 10-15 for a train that has just arrived.  right...

3. the fact that the mother was bitten but not killed.  so apparantly the zombies that got her only nibble.  sure they may have eaten and killed everyone else they've run across but i'm sure since she's a carrier/immune they didn't like the way she tasted. right...

4. the father becomes a zombie that is apparantly intelligent all of a sudden as he knows to hide from those that are trying to kill him and wait in corners until his prey is locked in the room with him.  right...

i can continue one with numerous small inconsistencies like the complete incompetence of the soldiers and their slow reaction time to someone slipping their perimeter.  not to mention the kid is covered in blood which if he touched his sister or the helo pilot it should have infected them if they had the slightest scratch.  or hey...why wouldn't the military scan them for infection like they did with the original survivors?  while many would say hey man it's a zombie film, why do you expect it to make sense?  (i know it's not technically a zombie movie... just bear with me) i would respond to those people that when i go see a movie like this i am suspending disbelief on the things that i know are important plot elements such as the existence of a rage virus, etc.  that does not give the writers the opportunity to just make up whatever they feel like without creating realistic scenarios, especially when all it would take is one intelligent person in the room to say ""hey... that doesn't really make sense...""

2902835,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I was in the minority of hardcore horror fans who found 28 Days Later to be a huge disappointment for a number of reasons, but I have to say that 28 Weeks Later is a much better film than its predecessor. I still can't see how any horror fan could rank either film as among the best zombie films ever made, though - there are just too many problems in evidence.

It's been six months since the ""Rage"" virus outbreak in Britain has been contained, and some civilians are now being allowed back into London - into a highly secure sector tightly controlled by the American military. You don't get in without a thorough medical examination, and the military are everywhere, from boots on the ground to eyes in the air to snipers on top of buildings. Yep, nobody's getting in or out of this place without authorization. Nothing could possibly go wrong here. Not even Houdini could possibly manage to evade all of this security.

The movie opens quite effectively, with a group of survivors holed up in a house having their dinner ruined by a full-scale onslaught of zombies. In a scene that forces you to wonder what you would do in the same situation, Don (Robert Carlyle) cowardly leaves his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) behind order to save his own ass. When his kids Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots) arrive back in new London from wherever they have been, he gives them an edited version of their mom's death. Now, you would think that two kids, one of whom is almost an adult (not to mention exceedingly hot), having already lost their mother to the virus, would never even dream of leaving the safety of their new home to wander out into the forbidden zone. Of course, you would also think that this tightly secured zone would at least have a gate or something to prevent that very thing from happening. Alas, no. Something potentially good actually comes from their escapade, though, as a survivor is found who is seemingly immune to the virus raging in her system. Now, you would think such an important medical subject would be watched and guarded more closely than Fort Knox, yet someone easily waltzes into her room, does something really stupid, and becomes infected. Once the authorities figure out what has happened, they immediately go to Code Red and lock the place down. Civilians are huddled into ""secure"" areas - unfortunately, just turning the lights off doesn't do much good if you're going to leave a door to the place all but wide open. Can you see a pattern here? Too little too late doesn't even begin to describe the security problems in evidence all throughout this film.

Anyway, the second half of the film consists of a race for survival, as Tammy, Andy, and a few others run for their lives from both the increasing numbers of brand-new zombies and the military forces out to exterminate them and everyone else in the infected sector. This is where the film really hits its stride, throwing numerous scenes of blood, explosions, and carnage at the viewer. It's good stuff, no doubt about it - not to mention timely. As the film's few good characters fell by the wayside, I cared less and less about those who remained (especially the annoying boy). I still consider the first film the gorier of the two, however, mainly because there are far less zombies vomiting up blood all over the place in this sequel.

The ending of 28 Weeks Later obviously lays the groundwork for a third film in the series, so expect a question or two to go unanswered here. While I was not anxious to see any sequel to the disappointing 28 Days Later, the improvements seen in this film give me hope that a third movie would definitely have potential. The ""less plot, more action"" approach so in evidence here indicates to me that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo recognized the extent of the plot problems inherent in Danny Boyle's original film, so the third time might truly be the charm.",1202515200,,3918,4.673913043478261

Darker scenes (and there's a lot of them) are horribly artifacted; there is graininess, clouding/fogging, and all around poor picture quality.  Apparently the film was not shot in hd, therefore the print will not look good.  Still, I would have thought they could use some sort of technology to smooth it out.

2902843,2,B000TJBN7Q,"""28 Days Later"" is easily the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.  What impressed me most about it was how intelligent it was; meaning, the suspension of disbelief was very manageable.  Once I got past the idea of a virus affecting someone in that way and spreading so quickly, the rest of the plot made perfectly good sense to me.  The few questions I had were easily enough sussed out over a beer with my friends.  When I heard that they were making a sequel I got very excited and actually marked my calendar.  Opening night, first showing after I got off work I was there.  Three hours later I was banging my head on a table and wondering if there was enough beer in the world to make sense of what I'd just seen.  ""28 Weeks Later"" should become a case study in film schools of how to take everything good about an amazing movie and toss it aside for the sequel.  As mentioned in some other reviews, the plot holes are enormous and unrelenting.  My ""favorite"" ones being: 1) the kids just walk out of the safe zone and we even see soldiers in the guard tower just let them go, 2) nobody is monitoring or guarding the infected (but not symptomatic) survivor, 3) her husband is dumb enough to kiss her, and 4) no matter how many city blocks the little boy is frantically driven through, his ""Raged-Out"" Dad quickly appears and focuses on attacking him and only him.  I was especially looking forward to see the virus spreading through a crowd, as was recounted in the first film.  Nope.  When it hits the fan in the train station, what happens?  The lights go out and we're given a bunch of quick-cut, strobing shots.  Gee, thanks.  Unless you're epileptic there's nothing scary about that.  I give this two stars mostly because I couldn't give ""Days"" seven.  Well, let's call it one for the opening sequence and one for the ending.  If it wasn't for the promise of seeing France get it in the next one, this movie would've totally turned me off to any future ""28 Anything"".",1201305600,3,1984,4.418732782369146
2902844,1,B000TJBN7Q,"Maybe I have seen too many of these types of films, because they are all looking the same.  These types of movies always require dumb characters doing incredibly stupid things that no normal human, who is not suffering from Downs Syndrome, would do.  One thing that is unique to the 28 Weeks Later (and 28 Days) is the puzzling fact that no human even fights back when attacked by a Rage Virus human.  They just seem to roll over and die?  It's lame.  The enormously complex plot (sarcasm) involves the Military trying to re-populate London.  It centers around a woman (Catherine McCormack) who is a carrier of the virus but not affected by it. Being totally predictable and relying on a tremendous amount of stupid actions by characters, it's easy to see where this movie is going.  Her idiot husband sneaks into the lab where his wife is being kept and kisses her, thus being infected and causing the Rage Virus to spread back into London.  Wow, didn't see that one coming.  Anyway, all havoc breaks loose as the infected guy escapes, easily killing helpless well armed soldiers that roll over and die without fighting back. There's no point in explaining the movie further, because you probably already figured out the rest.  It just boils down to the routine group of hapless people trapped in a city surrounded by hordes of infected trying to escape and getting picked off one by one.  I'm sure we will be subjected to a 28 Years Later at some point.  I can hardly wait.",1201219200,4,1475,4.630769230769231
2902845,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Very few horror movies are actually scary anymore... and the ones that are rarely succeed in doing anything besides making you jump. However, five years ago, 28 Days Later set a new standard in quality horror movies. In a genre that has largely been watered down to the point of irrelevancy, Danny Boyle not only reinvented the zombie movie, he breathed life back into horror. Now, the bar has been raised once again.

The plot is very straight forward: seven months after the Rage virus obliterated England, a US-led coalition attempts to secure and repatriate a small part of London. The infected starved to death a long time ago, so the danger seems to be over. Not quite... some minor spoilers follow in the main review.

Skeptics of Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's ability to take over for Boyle will be silenced within the first ten minutes of this film. The opening sequence, which takes the audience back to the original outbreak, was so emotionally charged and poignant I felt myself holding my breath waiting for it to be over. Don (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack) are held up in an old farmhouse with other survivors during the outbreak, but when the infected find them, Don panics and chooses to abandon Alice to save himself. The sheer intensity of this opening sequence is unrelenting in chaotic brutality. Even upon a second viewing, I feel a subtle sense of discomfort watching this sequence. The unbelievable speed at which cautious peacefulness dissolves into chaos leaves me impatiently waiting for a moment to breath. All the while, John Murphy's The House - In A Heartbeat provides the perfect music to add to an already building sense of tension.

As will most sequels, 28 Weeks Later turned up the volume from the original. More gore, more characters and a story on a much bigger scale. But unlike so many sequels than trade these things for quality directing and writing, 28WL managed to maintain the integrity of the first film while making certain elements even better.

The biggest highlight for me what the visual story telling. There are some verbal expositions, but the film's most powerful moments are mostly done without any dialogue. Even without words, the characters were believable (save for one, see my only criticism below) and the emotional weight of some scenes, coupled with strikingly appropriate music, was incredible. Whether it was seeing Don painfully transform into an infected and then murder the woman he was just passionately reunited with or the internal conflict of soldier Doyle as he is ordered to shoot everyone, not just the infected, the film's imagery held all the power. Possibly the best example of this is the scene when the infection begins to spread in a crowd of people. A clear throw-back to the original film, this scene showed what was only described in the first. The rage of the infected and the panic of those fleeing is practically indistinquishable, and once again we see just how quickly and viciously the virus spreads.

I can't speak for him obviously, but if I was George Romero, I would be ecstatic that new filmmakers have continued what he started. The zombies were always more symbolic than anything else in Romero's films. He used them for social commentary as much as he did to scare people. They have more a concrete presence of fear in the ""28"" film series, but truthfully, the zombies are not even traditional zombies. And unlike ""traditional"" zombie flicks, the ones in 28WL are not the focus point, only background for a greater conflict. The horrible nature of the infection is two-fold, the infected themselves and the chaos that ensues from those fleeing them.

The first film took a deep look at isolation and the utter dependence we have on the norms of society. The sequel, thankfully, took a much different approach, choosing to focus on the almost futile stuggle between man's desire to control and the chaos of our innermost emotions

Using a second viral outbreak for setup, 28WL manages to show the dark side of human nature. To me it seemed when the military begins killing everyone, we see the film's true brilliance. As a system of cold order struggles against the raw emotions of panic and rage, humanity is destroyed in the middle. In an instant, the military becomes just as scary as the infected. Also worth mentioning here is that 28WL is the first film I have seen besides Star Wars that successfully uses a wipe transition for dramatic effect. That's no small accomplishment.

These films challenge the traditional methodology of the zombie/survival horror by blurring the lines between what would be a ""happy"" outcome. In the first film's climax, we actually want to see a freed infected person kill or infect soldiers. This time around, we're again torn as the two innocent children struggle to survive, we know things might be better if they didn't.

My only problem with this film was Don after he is infected. While it was interesting to see a specific ""infected"" as a major character this time around, Don acted far too rationally to be believable. Patiently standing still, hiding in an alley to avoid the military firebombs; strike one. Then he somehow manages to follow his children at close proximity even after they drive a car across the city. Don also seems to travel alone, unlike the other infected, yet he never seems to be seen by anyone else besides his children. I can see the dramatic internal conflict Fresnadillo was trying to create by having the children's own father pursue them, but the way he did so came off as unrealistic and cheesy, and upon a second viewing this is even more evident.

Final Score: 9 Save for one drawback, this was an incredible sequel. It not only makes you jump, but think and feel. Well above the common horror movie, make sure you see this one soon.",1200873600,,5829,4.843373493975903
2902846,3,B000TJBN7Q,"Action and gore filled. But the characters were unlikable and they had no developement. It was also a little predictable. I liked the whole 'cure' possibility, which of course is something that makes a sequel quite possible. The intriguing, little details, and camera work gave '28 Days' a certain style. This same stylistic attempt in '28 Weeks' just didn't worked for me. Seemed stale, familiar shots. But it did do a good job of linking the sequels stylistically.

This movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, has too many points in it that I you are saying ""no way that would happen"" and you are too preoccupied about that to even care about what is happening on screen with the characters or plot. I didn't care about anyone surviving, because they were all idiots. The Father who kisses his obviously infected exposed wife, the two kids who sneak out to get photographs knowing that in time they would probably get them anyway, the soldiers and the doctor who have no common sense between them. I think I was harboring a secret fantasy that the little boy would get torn to shreds, because his behavior and downright stupidity made me frustrated. Who falls down stairs/escalators and just gets up and wanders off from there? Wouldn't you stay where you fell? The same ""Godspeed you black emperor"" song from the first movie, also made me mad, I guess they had to use it to tie it to the first, but to me it only reminded me how UNLIKE the first movie it really was! I actually snickered when the infected were running around France at the end, Le Rage Oui Oui!  I really want to one day take all the over acting infected shots and set them to music, maybe Barry Mani lows Copacabana?

2902849,2,B000TJBN7Q,"This is a very well made and nicely shot sequel. The opening sequence and the sequences with the snipers firing indiscriminating at the fleeing crowd below were very memorable and well executed. However, I was completely bugged about how simple it was for the father to access his wife who was supposed to be in some type of quarantine. I know that there are often lapses in logic and suspensions of disbelief in many movies and I am guilty of succumbing  to some of them. But this to me was a very glaring one .

For crying out loud, either the US Military was completely incompetent or the filmmakers didn't think it would be that glaring to the audience. Who in their right mind not put the mother in quarantine with at least one guard at the door let alone a nurse or technician monitoring her?????? Instead the facility was deserted. It was just too simple for the father to access her with a pass card or not. If a person was still found to be alive 28 weeks later with no symptoms in a quarantined zone in the real world, that person would be locked up and video monitored 24/7 for days if not weeks because they want to know how she survived and how she was ""immune"" to this virus. Such precautions would never be taken this lightly especially when you're dealing with a virus that nearly wiped out a whole country! If they didn't have strict protocals we would have been wiped out as a race a long time ago.

2902851,5,B000TJBN7Q,"It's hard to like a zombie movie these days...with the exception of the Rage Virus series (28 Days Later & 28 Weeks Later).

28 Weeks Later picks up about 6 months after the first movie.  The American military has taken over to contain the virus in Great Britain as well as monitoring the Brits to return and repopulate back to normalcy.  However, during the ""reconstruction"", there's a little episode in the countryside.

There's a small band of infected zombies that have raided a small house.  In the small house is a family along with some other surviving humans.  When the zombies raid, family man, Don, loses his courages and escapes for his own safety, leaving behind his wife, Alice, and others to zombies.

Don escapes to London to be reunited with his 2 children, who were sent to Spain during the initial virus outspread.  However, within days, Alice is discovered alive and brought back to London.  It is discovered that she has immunity to the Rage Virus.

Don, feeling guilty, goes to see his wife at the military clinic.  He pleads with his wife to forgive him.  He kisses her and instantly becomes infected with the virus.  Then...all hell breaks loose.

Meanwhile, the military must protect these 2 children as they may possibly carry the immunity just like their mother.  At the same time, the father is out to infect them.

Fast-paced, which seems to be the trend, as seen in Transformers and Bourne Ultimatum.  This movie will definitely not bore you but put you on the edge of your seat.",1200009600,,1508,4.716475095785441
2902852,2,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later is such a well handled film in terms of suspense, acting and meaning, that every time I watch it I get more convinced that it will become a classic in the horror-sci fi genre. Not so with the ""sequel"", which might be well directed by Fresnadillo, but it is not well structured as narrative, and it does not lend any valuable ""message"" to the audience. 28 Weeks Later incurs frequently in the mistake of insulting our intelligence. How can you explain that the husband of the survivor female who is detained in a security health facility can have access to the room encountering no guard, no medics, no soldier or vigilant personnel in the place? There are not even cameras, in a situation in which the reappearance of the virus is feared and it is possible, after the diagnose made by the medical personnel of the female survivor. In fact, that is the key event that originates the virus breach. Besides, the film is so focused in bloodshed, vampire's biting and running, that no meaningful dialogue is possible, preventing one to make any sense of the chaos. And what can you tell about the helicopter used as a mortal power saw for beheading dozens of zombies-vampires? The least  I can say is that the scene is the peak of sensationalism. And insisting about the meaning of the film, why such a valuable element in the story as is the possibility that the female survivor, or her children, hold the key to the cure of the virus is just wasted in favor of leaving the audience with a terrible, pessimistic and fatal ending? Is that the bait for another sequel, parallel to the ""Alien"" series? Meanwhile, we are left with a ""sequel"" that does not honor properly 28 Days Later, no matter the fact that Boyle is among the producers.",1199923200,3,1745,4.592948717948718
2902853,1,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was a brilliant and terrifying movie about a deadly virus spreading like wildfire throughout Britain, and the world?  The characters, while not dynamic, did a great job in their roles.  This piece of garbage follow up was not interesting, did not challenge your brain, and overkilled on all-out grossness instead of the tense and frightening moments from the original.  Unlike in the first movie where we see that Cilian Murphy has some acting talent, Robert Carlyle is completely wasted in a stupid main? role as the villain who begins re-spreading the rage virus.  I also believe Carlyle is a much better actor than the role he took here.

Whereas the first movie brought up interesting questions about humanity in a semi-post-apocalyptic state, and really showed human nature at its worst, to some folks it was the ultimate manifestation of the mans fall from grace, that is his sinful state, or if you prefer, it was our evolutionary nature perfectly shown by survival of the fittest, kill the weak, etc.

Finally, don't waste your money on this trash of 28 Weeks Later, because you will find the plot silly and completely against everything that was established in the first film.  The acting is terrible and wooden, the zombies are not even as cool as they were before, etc. etc.",1199923200,10,1299,4.850678733031674
2902854,4,B000TJBN7Q,"In order to review Weeks Later, it's necessary to say something about Days:

This first leg of the franchise managed to transcend the genre by putting characters at the forefront and weaving poignant moments and themes through an unpredictable narrative.  Sure, it was a zombie movie, but it wasn't JUST a zombie movie.

Days also managed to function as a well-oiled piece of science fiction.  It established the rules regarding the ""rage virus"" and then set our protagonists free to work against it.

Simply put, 28 Days Later is not only a classic of the horror genre, but one of the best dramas I've ever seen.

So where does Weeks stand?  Separated from its forebear, Weeks is a more than competent zombie thriller.  It features some truly beautiful cinematography in spots (though there's a good deal of the ever-popular ""shaky camera"" work to bring the film down in this category).  The action is also quite good in spots- there's a kill scene about 2/3 of the way through that won't be soon forgotten.

Viewed as a sequel to 28 Days Later, Weeks is all over the place.  It needs to be said that the first 30 minutes made me feel like I was watching a true successor to Days.  Somehow, the intimacy of strangers so well captured in Days had been resurrected.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't hold up as well.  By the halfway point, the plot has degenerated into the genre standards.  It executes them well, But the movie no longer feels like Days- no matter how much the score claims otherwise.

On a particularly disturbing note, the film breaks continuity with Days regarding the contagious nature of the virus.  People get splattered with zombie blood and walk away no different than before.  As someone who hopes Boyle returns to direct the inevitable third movie, this change bother me most of all.

Weeks still struck me as the second best zombie movie I've ever seen.  The action is tight, the sights are breathtaking, and the plotting is fast enough to account for deficiencies in depth.  Just don't be surprised that director Fresnadillo hasn't managed to one-up Danny Boyle- few can, right?",1199404800,3,2118,4.763736263736264
2902855,1,B000TJBN7Q,"Awful, awful. I really wanted to like this movie.  I'd read the reviews that the producers were 'cashing in' and creating a franchise, but preferred not to believe them. Wish I'd saved my money.

The subtext of commenting on the Iraq invasion (eg, creating the safe zone' for survivors that isn't safe) is interesting- but I still have enough faith in the US military that they'd make better plans to contain another virus outbreak and protect survivors than they do in this movie.

Similarly, 28 Weeks has too many logical lapses to be enjoyable (escaping poison gas by shutting the vents off in a Volvo wagon?! I know they're safe, but???).

And there are details that don't make sense- I'm not a helicopter expert, but at one point the US Army's flying what looks like an Aerospatiale Gazelle, a European helicopter.  Could've at least rented a Sikorsky Blackhawk for the movie- shouldn't have broken the budget.

28 Weeks Later lacks the cleverness and excitement of the first film. Awful, awful.",1199318400,5,1000,4.852941176470588

I had to turn my head during the helicopter scene, and was actually hoping for the movie to finish.

2902857,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Although they aren't the undead, the ravenous hordes in the ""28 Days..."" films are close enough to what zombies have come to represent, to be counted as de facto zombies.  And thus what we have here is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made, a horrifying, apocalyptic, well-made, character-rich movie that succeeds brilliantly in both the explosive, action-packed scenes and the character driven, story-building ones.  Twenty-eight weeks after the conclusion of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(I should stop now to point out that if you haven't seen the first one yet, you might not want to read this or any other review of the sequel until you have), the infected hordes in the quarantined United Kingdom have long since perished from hunger and general 'burn-out'.  Plans have been carefully made to begin reintroducing some of the millions of refugees back into England.  A multinational military effort spearheaded by the United States takes charge of clearing out safe zones, transporting the first waves back in, and guarding the 'safe' section of London against the as-yet unsecured rest of the country.  Unbeknownst to anybody, not far from the safe zone, a peculiar survivor remains, one who doesn't seem to be infected....at least not in the way the others were.

  When a series of unforseen events, involving - among other things - a previously unknown variant of the infection, results in a breach of the safe zone, things very quickly go from bad to worse, and the military command responds with a shockingly ruthless decision that prompts some of its soldiers to turn and take matters into their own hands to try and save some of London's newly re-introduced inhabitants, who now have multiple problems to worry about.

  There's a lot more to it than that, but I'm trying to avoid giving too much of it away, or too much towards the end.  That's the basic scenario, and blurring the lines between the good guys and the bad guys is one of the things that makes ""28 Weeks Later"" work so well.  Things unfold in unexpected ways, there are some very innovative scenes, and overall it feels very fresh and unpredictable in spite of the 1,273 other zombie movies out there (that's an exageration, but maybe not by much).  Now a lot of those movies are very good (and some are pretty bad) but this is one of the ones that really stands out from the pack. Some have said that the movie's other elements - the extended time before the breakout, the military prescence itself, etc. - took away too much time from the zombies themselves, but I'd disagree.  That was a bit of a problem with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Dead-Unrated-Edition/dp/B00005JO16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Dead (Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;(still a good movie) but here they got the balance and the pacing just right, in my opinion.

  The ending is a memorable shocker, a should-have-seen-it-coming-but-didn't moment, and casts the whole film in a new light.  Well-acted with great effects and a terrific musical score, 28 Weeks Later succeeds on all levels.

2902862,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later is more than what it seems. It is the sequel to to 28 days later, which is loosely based on the terrific prescient science fiction novel Day of the Triffids.

The Day of the Triffids is about the dangers of meddling with mother nature and weapons we do not completely understand and control. The triffids are a new variety of plant that yields important oils, yet is pretty enough to keep as an ornamental. But, the Triffids have a bite too. They can move, and they can kill anything that moves with a whiplike appendage. The oils that they secrete are important enough that they are raised on plantations in spite of this, and they are kept, almost as pets, to show off their exotic beauty by the well to do.

Then the unthinkable happens. A new satellite weapon (the book was written just as sattelites happened) gets accidentaly released and blinds almost everyone. Only a few people are not blinded. Most of the book follows a few people as they try to cope with understanding what has happened, and then with the less than sociable response of some of the survivors and the murderous Triffids.

The book is part of the apocalyptic view of the future that some people had in the 1950's in response to nuclear weapons, the realignment of power, and other tremendous changes in life.

28 days later just translates the plot to the modern day. Instead of the Triffids, we have the Rage virus, a plausible possibility given the secret biological military research that has gone on in the last 50 years. The virus gets loose, and there is no vaccination, and no immunity. Almost everyone dies. In a reverse of the usual British pride at being an Island, and protected from the world, they virus is contained on the island, and the rest of the world is protected. Still, no one understands what has happened, or wants to come to the rescue. During the outbreak, the movie follows a few people as they strive to remain good and survive the outbreak. Along the way they have to deal with other groups that have lost their human souls and prey upon the uninfected in ways that are equally as bad as the infected. By sheer luck, a small band survives their ordeal, and is rescued several weeks or months later.

28 Weeks Later carries on the biological menace theme. The infected die out, the few uninfected are found and rescued, and people are returned to Britain to start up anew. Life is beginning to renew itself, and even children (the innocents) are returning. But, biology is more complicated than most of us want to admit, and one of the survivors turns out to be a carrier. The normal human frailties intervene to unintentionally preserve the virus and transport it to Europe.

As just a horror movie it is superb (not that I am a great expert). It has suspense equal to Night of the Living Dead. You want to root for the survivors. And perhaps the conclusion sneaks up on you. But if you understand enough of the potential of biology it dosen't.

As science fiction it is also superb. It is not just a zombie creature film. It is also an imaginable alternative future of mankind. It is yet another of the parables about the dangers of science, industry, and war that seem to regularly come out of the English longing for the quiet pastoral life.

As a tale of what humans will do under duress it is also superb. There are the leaders without pity for the people, the followers who blindly walk to their own demise, and those who fight for what is right and good in all of us. And none of them really knows what is what nature has in store for them. But do we really understand what we are doing?

2902863,1,B000TJBN7Q,"I am honestly shocked by the number of overwhelmingly good...no, great reviews on this film. Especially given that they all seem to be -- I did not take the time to read them all -- by people who loved the first film. 28 Days Later was a film terrifying in ways Hollywood seemed to have abandoned decades ago. It got under your skin and freaked you out because it lurked in the realm of possibility, scaring on an intellectual level the current generation of film-goers has only read about in books. Then along comes a sequel all the reviewers say is better than the original. Naturally, you buy it because the original was arguably the best zombie flick ever.

28 Weeks Later takes a step in the wrong direction within the first few minutes. Suddenly the virus, the original virus, takes only a matter of seconds to take hold? Not the several minutes from the first flick, which gave the unnerving possibility of getting away from the pack only to realize you brought a zombie along for the ride? Already, it's getting back into Hollywood's comfort zone. They can't actually write anything truly scary, so they have to rely on loud music, sudden movement, and gore. *heavy sarcasm* Wow, that's scary. It just goes downhill from there, leaping from one moment of senseless violence to another in predictable, there's nothing to really be afraid of here, Hollywood fashion. It took one independent screenwriter to make something new and exciting. Then it took an entire team of Hollywood screenwriters to come along and f! ck that phenomenal thing up.

The premise is the only thing 28 Weeks Later has going for it and that was rather quickly lost in the sheer idiocy of the execution. A lot of people have issues with the U.S. Military these days, but there's still no way a civilian would be allowed access to an experimental military facility. At least not without an escort. The best way to have gone about recirculating the virus in this film would have been if Major/Dr. Dumbass had dropped a test tube containing the carrier's blood. Then the Army is portrayed in an uncharacteristically humanitarian way by not immediately opening up on the crowd with machine gun fire. Let's face it. There's no way the U.S. Army wastes time with snipers when a highly contagious, extremely deadly disease is at risk of spreading to mainland Europe. Everybody would die and the U.S. Government would apologize for it later. 15000 people just aren't worth the billions such a disease could infect if it could sweep like a wildfire across EurAsia. Sadly, no one cares because gore sells. It sells because movie audiences haven't seen intellectual terror since Boris Karloff, with the exception of 28 Days Later. I'm not saying movies should be realistic. We'd all get bored because we can see that on the news everyday. I'm saying for a horror film to be truly scary, it HAS to have at least one foot in reality because the idea that something like that could really happen is what made the first film truly scary.",1197763200,9,3003,4.739961759082218
2902884,5,B000TJBN7Q,"I Liked this one as much or even more than 28 days. The movie here focuses on the aftermath of the rage virus, pikcing up the pieces where 28 days left of. The movie starts 28 Weeks later when around 1000 odd english citizens are allowed to return back to London but they are confined to stay in a military guarded and protected block of the city called sector 1. The story develops as one of the infected from outside the sector is brought into the sector as the subject does not show sypmtoms of rage virus but it is later found that the subject is immune to the virus but is neverthless a carrier of the virus. Unlike the previous one by Danny Boyle which aimed at more of a cult clasic or film noir style and pretty much focused on 5 characters against an army of zombies, this one is more centered on the emass infection of people  and we also get to see the role of the army as a overseeing body which protects the people and also kills those very people without compassion following strict military orders when there is a chance that they have been infected. The zombies are portrayed with greater movement and agility and ferociousness than in 28 days. There is also more blood and gore. The direction is spot on keeping the tempo up and the tension pulsating. The Soundtrack follows the same grunge metal theme which acts as the coda for the diseased and hopeless london. The movie sustains interest because it paints this grand canvas of large scale infection seen and experienced through the eyes of a family. Robert Carlyle is the father of this family and it is about him and his two daughters and his wife and what happens to them along the way.  I won't give away more than that. The spanish director of this film is really good and this is his first movie in the English language. This guy is going to make a lot of good movies. He is that good. He's a made a sequel that stands up to the predecessor.

2902890,1,B000TJBN7Q,"What a disgrace to the original this was.

The short form: A wonderful, moody movie, zombie-like foes who were relentless and brutal, but still (relatively) believable with weaknesses turns out a sequel with uber-monsters, unbelievable coincidences, and overkill that never actually kills any of their targets.

Most people classify these as zombie films because of the basic similarity ... near-human critters with an insatiable need to destroy us, born of malice, food, what-have-you.  It doesn't necessarily matter where they come from, how or why they do what they do, fast or slow ... what matters, what makes movies like this is the all-too-human reactions to these impossible circumstances.  How we act, how we react.  It was the secret to the success of Shaun of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Living Dead, even some of the Return of the Living Dead series.  It's the realism of the human response.

This is the failure of 28 Weeks Later.  Gone is the Human response that was so authentic and believable.  Welcome to gross caricature and incredible coincidence.  Welcome to unabashed popcorn-guzzling movie reality where the American Military assists survivors in repopulating a so-called ""safe zone"" in the middle of a possible viral zone with checkpoints based more on cameras than actual guards.

Pay no attention to the fact that the janitor / superintendant not only has full access to all the residential zones (which he abuses by setting off the zone-wide alarm right near the start), but also all restricted military biohazard quarantine zones as well.

Ignore the ease with which two children escape from the safe zone, steal a corpse's motorcycle keys and return to their home, despite the possible horror and infection that this should logically bring.

Pretend that somehow, a single survivor was able to evade previously-shown certain death and survive for (counts the weeks) 8 months (7 months + 28 days, approximately), maybe less, and move the presumably incredible distance from rural Britain to Main Street Central, London, despite the fact that later in the film, the Infected clearly have no reason to NOT attack this survivor.

Imagine that somehow, one of the monsters, despite being infected by ""Rage"" is able to utilize previously-unknown ninja-like stealth and cruel, sadistic patience rather that the blind, unthinking blunt rage from which the virus gets its name, and that this one monster gains superhuman resistance, extranormal senses and nearly infallible tracking ability.

Tell yourself that it is somehow possible that the best helicopter pilot on the planet is assigned security and is able to destroy legions of zombies by flying straight at them, in effect being more effective at killing a crowd of zombies then neighborhood-wide firebombing, nigh-instantaneously-fatal nerve gas (bearing in mind that these are just crazy people, more or less), and teams of highly trained snipers and soldiers in Biohazard (NBC) gear with flamethrowers and (assumedly) the support and equipment that would be necessary to back them.

And, if you're still willing to spend time or money watching this film, consider that the only unpredictability in this film comes how different the ""uberzombie"" is from the rest of the zombies.  This film does not surprise with suspense so much as it bludgeons you with shock, and even then, it seems more gratuitous rather than done for any sort of reasonable plot / story / artistic decision, sort of a ""let's pile on the gore to really scare people!""

Terribly disappointing, from its unrealistic human response to incredible plot holes and coincidences and an ending that tells the viewer, ""congratulations, what you just paid for was nothing more than an hour-plus ad for a sequel we hope to con you into watching,"" this movie is can generously be noted as ""sub-par,"" and far worse if you're any fan of the original 28 Days Later.",1196553600,36,3919,5.115987460815047

There was an outbreak of a virus that could very easily have spelled the end of the whole world, yet they start sending people back to London before it is even completely cleaned up.  There are still dead and, presumably, infected bodies all over the place yet people are moving back in.  Sure, they move back into a fenced in compound but THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN before the whole place was decontaminated.  Then, a couple of kids breach army defenses at the compound and head out into the city.  As if they wouldn't have been shot on sight.  This movie is nothing but a giant plot hole from the first scene to the ending credits.  I could write a thesis on all the stuff that's wrong with it and believe me, I'm telling everyone who will sit still long enough to listen.  Don't waste your precious time on this.  It's a shame that the first movie has to be sullied by this piece of junk.",1196380800,5,1386,4.33852140077821

It's great. I liked it just as well as the first one. Yes.",1196035200,,357,4.085714285714285
2902905,3,B000TJBN7Q,"I will not forgive them for what they did to the mother. Nuff said. Don't want to make this a spoiler zone. But I don't forgive them. It screwed up the story and made it go downhill fast.

That said: This started out so well.

The moment where Robert Carlyle's character (and I love this actor, on reason I rented the flick, the other being I enjoyed the first by Boyle) has to make his dread choice, and then he's running, running, running to the dock with those crazed ""zombies"" is really horrifying. I felt that buzz of suspense. Sure, I knew he had to survive to make the film continue, but it was directed in such a way that it worked. Scary!

The futuristic concept of the isolated zone, military-controlled, the soldiers getting a bit lax, the survivors waiting for life to normalize, etc, all that felt nicely post-apocalyptic. I had, however, a hard time buying that anyone would really want to come back from a safe US to a corpse-riddled, ravaged London. Come on. Would you? Naw. I'm thinking I'd ask for asylum. It strained credulity.

The whole reunion, angst, the dread of when the next virus surge would come, that was all well-done. But once the infection strikes again, it pretty much mostly goes to a place that bored me. Bloody and gory and brutal, but boring. And I had a very hard time sympathizing with the kids. When one stops caring if the children in a story live or die--that's problematic. I stopped caring. And yet, their situation was so awful, I should have cared. The script did not MAKE me care if they got eaten by ragies.

The ending, however, had a glorious final bit of visual action. It sets this up for yet a third film in this storyline, too. But I doubt I'll be excited to watch it if it's going to do the same downhill slide as this one did in the second part. Suggestion: Make me care that the people survive, the way I did in the first film. I gotta want the leads to make it, or why watch? Flesh-eating isn't that rivetting.

2902906,2,B000TJBN7Q,"I'll admit it: ""28 Weeks Later"" - Juan Fresnadillo's sequel to Danny Boyle's breakout horror-hit - is the definite best of its genre this season, and lightyears better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel-Part-II/dp/B000UJ48P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel: Part II</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-IV/dp/B001053038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw IV</a>. The film, faithful to many of the theatrical antics of its predecessor, continues the evolution of the typical zombie slasher. Simultaneously dark & slimy and bright & gritty, it's the film that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000XJ5TOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;never was: a terrifying race between the living and the infected where the paranormal has no place and the term ""thriller"" is defined. It's one of the better sequels of the year, and even franchise-creator Danny Boyle had no bad things to say about it.

That being said, ""28 Weeks"" easily goes down for me as one of the most terrible perversions in the history of film. Under the guise of staying legitimate through the continued use of digital photography and shaky cam, the movie blasts you with all the antics of blockbuster cinema and dares you to question its integrity. There is, however, nothing theatrically or dramatically significant about the lows that ""Weeks"" resorts to in order to shock audiences, which include more blood, grindhouse violence, and the watering-down of characters to the point that they're completely one-dimensional.

Everything that was good or visionary about the original film has become a color-by-numbers process that the director follows in hopes of replicating what was unique a couple years ago. From the moment that the first lady is infected and spews blood, everything is mechanical and typically B-grade, with absolutely nothing about the action, thrills, or suspense being inventive or otherwise not a re-hash of other, lesser zombie films.

In addition, we have the new list of concepts that've been introduced in an attempt to ""spice up"" the scenario for a strictly American audience: nightmares of the dead, an increased level of violence and onscreen gore (culminating in a scene where an infected man beats his bound wife, gouges her eyes out, and rips her throat to shreds), and attempts to draw parallels to the real-life invasion of Iraq - all tasteless, unimaginative, and contemporary cliches that serve to degrade what might've been a great film had it been left in the hands of the independents. The butchered story - an appetizer for the gorehounds - is an ugly face beneath the facade of ""one of the best sequels ever made"": ugly, artificial, and full of antics which it knows nothing to do with.

""28 Weeks Later"" is a blockbuster at best, and at its best, it's tense and suspenseful, exhilarating and exciting. As a matter of fact, it can stay that way if you're not looking for anything deeper than a flesh wound. However, if you're looking for a match to the original's emotional trek, you'll be disappointed. The film ends before the adventure seems to have begun, but already 15,000 people have been burned up. What's more, the final shot of the Eiffel Tower promises that we'll get more gooey blood and snarling folks come 2009. The question remains, will Danny Boyle return to the director's chair to save his shriveling franchise? Who knows...",1195948800,3,3527,5.674242424242424
2902907,5,B000TJBN7Q,"What can I say?  I'm a sucker for zombie movies.  As such I thoroughly enjoyed the low-budget, high concept endeavor that was ""28 Days Later"".  Was it a perfect film?  Not by any means.  I'll grant that it drags a bit at the start and fizzles a bit toward the end.  But what is sandwiched in between is pure joy.

When I heard a sequel was being released I was not at all surprised.  But like most fans of the first film, I wasn't expecting much.  Sequel films of any genre tend to disappoint more often than not, let alone horror sequels.  But damned if I wasn't going to watch ""28 Weeks Later"" anyway.  Boy was I surprised.

Despite a totally new cast and different director (spanish speaking at that), ""28 Weeks Later"" manages to dial up the intensity with a clever and plausible view into the not too distant future.  The movie picks up of course, 28 weeks after the first outbreak of the rage virus.  This time the story focuses on the clean-up and reintegration of citizens back in to London to start over.

But the writer/s were clever in their approach.  While the film still has large scale scope, the story focuses mainly on one family and allows us to really emotionally connect to them, rather than just sit and wait for them to become zombie food.  In addition we discover that this family will play a critical role in the fate of the world versus the rage virus.

So why is the sequel better?  No secrets here.  The characters and story are simply better written, acted and executed.  Further, the film clocks in at a very tight 1 hour and 32 minutes.  But worry not, there's still plenty of gore to go around.  I would have to say though, that the best aspect of the sequel is the cinematography.  It's exquisite...and I don't mean for a horror flick.  I mean for any type of film period.  Inventive and clever shots abound in this film which keeps perspective fresh and always engaging.

I can't envision anyone who loved the first film not loving this sequel even more.  ""28 Weeks Later"" accomplishes what has proven nearly impossible in film making.  It not only maintains the continuity and feel of the first film, but also manages to carve out it's own identity rather than just regurgitate the first film in a different wrapper.  No small feat these days.  I believe that the two films as a package are must own material.",1195516800,,2342,4.478672985781991
2902908,4,B000TJBN7Q,"First things first--I really did not like the original movie, 28 Days Later. Not because they ""weren't zombies"" but because I found the plot derivative, the action muted and slow, and the characters silly (not to mention the premise of the movie seemed ridiculous to me). That said, I had low expectations for the sequel. Boy, was I ever glad I rented this movie--so glad that I ponied up the cash and purchased it immediately.

'Weeks' succeeds on all the levels that its predecessor stumbled on. The opening sequence is one of the BEST I have seen for horror in years. Whereas 'Days' begins with a whimper, 'Weeks' opens up with an undeniable bang. While 'Days' tried to be artsy and claimed originality, 'Weeks' threw that to the wind and made a gory, more sensational story--and somehow ended up being even more humane and effective than the first movie! I appreciated how the military was not reverted to the (yawn!) inhuman robotic EVIL BAD role. At one point they are forced to fire on innocent civilians, but the decision to do so is not because they are evil, but rather a strategic decision that makes sense and is revealed to the audience. That, along with the struggle that an individual sniper and an army medic face lends humanity to the story and balances things nicely.

Similarly, the dramatic center of this story--involving a broken family of a father, a mother left for dead, a brother and a sister--was touching, heartbreaking, and endearing beyond any relationship in the first film. Robert Carlyle does an amazing job (as always) in the role of the father.

The visuals and editing for this movie also improved on 'Days'; it still kept the haunting soundtrack, but improved on the technique and graininess of its predecessor. Oh, and there are more infected, more blood, explosions, palpable terror and chaos to delight even the most hardened zombie fan.

So with all these things going for it, why not five stars? There are some serious plot holes that bug, and I'm not sure if they have been discussed in other reviews yet, or if other reviewers were bugged by certain story aspects. Mild spoilers follow, so please don't read if you don't want to know.

The first glaring error is when the general tells the medic that they know enough about the rage virus, and that it cannot spread between species. Considering the premise for the first movie was human infection from a raged-up monkey, this is silly. Just a nitpick, but silly nonetheless. Secondly, why on earth would the father (who is not military personell, he isn't American, from what I can tell, he has no real important role whatsoever) have access to private military holding rooms, especially with someone so valuable as the carrier/infected mother? Why wasn't there any security in the area? The final (and more significant) problem I had with the film was the overwhelming need to save the young boy because of his natural immunity to the rage virus, and this concept of a cure. The virus spreads and infects almost instantaneously. A vaccination to prevent rage outbreaks I suppose could work--except that from the boy's mother (who was infected, but immune), we see that anyone with any direct fluid transfer interaction with her immediately becomes infected. If someone was not vaccinated, they'd immediately succumb to the virus, killing, ripping, infecting anyone else in their path. Even if a cure was found from the boy's blood, the logistics of injecting all the infected (who are highly dangerous and contagious) would hardly be worth the costly effort. Especially considering these AREN'T undead zombies--the infected parties will die within a few weeks when they can't feed (as the audience knows from narrative at the beginning of this movie). It would be much easier (and safer) to simply wait out until the infected die of starvation, and rebuild from there. From a tactical standpoint, it didn't really make much sense. But perhaps this was intentional. It certainly makes the choices of the characters more poignant; and that unlikely, stubborn hope in that face of futility becomes all the more meaningful, even if the plot is a bit uneven as a consequence.

Having said all this, the bottom line is that I absolutely love this movie. I highly recommend buying this film; it is everything you could ever ask for in a zombie movie.",1195430400,,4338,4.879240162822253
2902909,4,B000TJBN7Q,"'28 Weeks Later' is as good, if not better than '28 Days Later', so its probably 4 and a half stars for me. Right from the opening scenes this will have you hooked. Robert Carlyle as Donald Harris is holed up in a remote house with his wife and some other survivors. This immediately brings 'Night of the Living' to mind, and '28 Weeks Later' can certainly be compared with that ground breaking film.

There are a number of brilliantly realised set pieces in this film. One near the start and another that hinges around a plot twist, which you might see coming, but I didn't. It also has some genuinely creepy moments , most noteably in the London Underground, where frankly I didn't want to watch (but had to). The acting is all of a very high standard and the Director has done a fine job recreating the sort of post-apocalyptic feel that the first film had.

My only real criticisms are that sometimes I found the fast-cutting a little too fast for my liking, but maybe I'm just getting old. Also there is a rather unlikely scene near the end which seemed a little contrived. However the actual ending was very good and certainly left the producers an opening to make another film. That would be a mistake though, because overall this is cracking film that any subsequent sequel would undoubtably fail to match.",1195430400,,1314,4.563559322033898

2902911,3,B000TJBN7Q,"*****May Contain Semi-Pre-Conclusion Spoilers

I liked this film's predecessor, 28 Days Later. The concept and the thrills were good, so naturally, I had to check out the sequel to find out what transpired over the next 28 weeks.......

28 Weeks Later begins at the time of 28 Days Later at a cottage in the English countryside inhabited by 6 survivors who are hiding out from the infected. Among them are Don and his wife Alice, with an older couple, and twenty-somethings Jacob and Karen, the latter of whom is awaiting the safe return of her boyfriend, who ventured out 5 days prior, never to be seen again.

A knock at the door during lunch is hesitatingly answered, only to reveal a young boy in peril, whom they quickly let in. As he eats and tells of his terrors, Karen opens a small space in a boarded-up window to look outside and an infected reaches in and infects her immediately. Following a few moments of mayhem and further infection-spreading, Jacob flees, and Don, in an act of extreme cowardice or plain selfishness, also escapes, despite the pleas of Alice, who is left behind with the young boy to fend off the infected ones.

Apparently, Don knew that to stay behind and help anyone but himself would be the end of him. He hightails it to a boat which Jacob reached shortly beforehand. Jacob is attacked and taken down then Don manages to get away, unscathed. He winds up in a military camp and is quarantined as he awaits the return of his 2 children, Andy and Tammy.

Enter 28 Weeks Later.....Britain is gradually being repopulated. At this point, there are 15,000 civilians who have been allowed back under U.S. Military-Guarded Code Green Confinement. Tammy and Andy are the first and only children who have been allowed back post-virus after having stayed in USA since the initial outbreak.

Don tearfully breaks the news to the kids about their mother, convincing them in an off-handed manner that she was killed and he did all he could do to save her or at least, by golly, to save himself. There is no doubt he regrets his actions and presently has deep remorse. At this point, he may be in denial or may be simply flat out exaggerating his would-be heroics. It was lost on me.

That night, young Andy tells Tammy that he will not be able to recall his mom's face, that he does not even have a photo to remember her by, so the next day the 2 kids escape (without much problem) to return to their family home to retrieve photos and certain items. There they find their mother alive at the same time the military swarms in to recapture the 2 young refugees. Alice (the mother) is put in restricted quarantine and strapped down while left unmonitored (via monitors), unwatched (in person), and unguarded (outside the door).

Medical officer Scarlett determines that Alice was clearly bitten by an infeced one, yet shows no symptoms. She is a carrier of the virus with natural immunity. It is a genetic abnormality that could be imperative in
leading to a cure and she is thus deemed as either invaluable for further testing or else as a curse to get rid of. As this is being discussed between the General and Dr. Scarlett, Don gets into Alice's room, steals a kiss, and becomes instantly infected. Don then goes on the run and the infection is rampantly spread, ensuing in mass chaos, whereby the military enforces Code Red Status to target and kill any and all civilians.

Meanwhile, Scarlett and military officer Doyle understand the importance of protecting and preserving Andy and Tammy, for one or both of them may carry their mother's gene that could lead to a cure, thus do all they can to help the kids to safety. Of course their plan is impeded all the way
by the infected ones and the military, as they race to a certain location to be picked up by Doyle's helicopter pilot pal Flynn (played by Harold Perrineau -- Michael from TV's Lost).

That's the synopsis, more or less. As others have said, the plot holes are many. As well, an utter sense of purposlessness was prevalent once the protagonists grew increasingly outnumbered. There was overall intensity throuhout, plenty blood and gore, fine acting, with a few too many less-than-intelligent characters. All in all, a good action/thriller movie for anyone not wanting to get too seriosly involved. As a sequel,
it was entertaining enough, but in my opinion, 28 Days Later was the better of the two. There seems to be varying opinions on that. My expectations were maybe too high on this flick after seeing somewhat above-average reviews. I will say I was not bored because I had too many questions.

I had to wonder:

1) Were we supposed to care about Don? I certainly didn't.
2) How or why did Don keep popping up in scenes involving his children? I
  kept thinking ""isn't he dead yet?""
3) Why were the 2 kids able to return to Britain in the first place since
  no kids were allowed back yet?
 4) I presume the US military was brought in because Britain's
  military had been expended? Nice way to fictionalize or showcase the
  U.S. military as incompetent and rash in decision-making.
5) Were the kids to blame for new outbreak by finding thier virus-
  carrying mother? Or was Don to blame for kissing her and spreading the
  Rage anew? Or was the military to blame for lax regulations?",1195344000,,5282,4.641630901287554

2902926,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I disliked the original in this series for two reasons: first, the illogical and stupid conduct of some characters that acts to set up contrived moments of terror and disaster, and second, the clichd portrayal of military characters as amoral incompetent thugs. I liked the sequel quite a bit better, though the first issue does recur to some degree.

First, the plot in a nutshell: the Rage virus which turns its victims into living berserkers has burned its way through the UK, killing many and causing a mass evacuation of the survivors. The rage victims lack the focus to eat and so starve to death in about six months, allowing a cautious US led repopulation of the British Isles, beginning with the Isle of Dogs in London. The film follows the lives of one particularly unique family during the attempted resettlement and the new outbreak of the Rage virus that threatens to destroy the new society and the family as well.

This movie offers all the scariness of the first one with the beginning sequence and the auditorium outbreak standing out as especially scary set-pieces. What 28 Weeks has over 28 Days is a bigger budget, less boring downtime moments (let's watch the survivor shave without using water!), and more of an epic scope. The helicopter versus zombies moment takes the classic Romero moment from Dawn of the Dead and redoes it on a heroic scale, and the action sequences are expertly filmed and choreographed.

The politics of the movie seem at first to be a condemnation of America in Iraq, but the military characters are nowhere near as villainous as those in the original, and the brutal quarantine methods used seem sadly appropriate given the risks of an outbreak. Ironically, the spreading of Rage to the Continent is directly a result of soldiers disobeying orders and allowing their humanity to cause them to waive the ""Code Red"" orders. The theme of the US Army standing by impotently in the Green Zone as civilians kill each other and the soldiers in fits of savage insanity while the attempt to rebuild a shattered nation fails of course has more than a little topicality, but the theme is nuanced, not heavy-handed, and ultimately the viewer can take it or leave it and still enjoy the movie.

The characters this time around are generally well-portrayed though we do not see much exposition about their backstories or perspectives, due to the fast pace and frequent action. The family under siege is excellent with Carlyle and McCormack standing out in fairly skimpy roles, and the kids being somewhat weaker. The military characters including even the commanding general are well done, and one senses the horror and sense of loss the soldiers are experiencing even as they execute unthinkable orders. The scene in the control room as all the CCTV cameras slowly blank out is superbly done.

What are the problems? Well, mainly with the contingency planning of the military. Perhaps the military planners are deliberately intended to seem like morons (perhaps oblique Iraq commentary?), but the huge flaws in planning that allow the outbreak to quickly reach crisis levels seem to be pretty noticeable ones. For instance, in case an infectious subject is found and isolated, why place them in a lab without any guards or observation? The whole sequence where the guilty (and apparently horny) Robert Carlyle is infected by his wife, transforms into a carrier over the space of a few minutes, kills his wife, and then breaks out of the lab should simply not be possible given the ludicrously high security levels established earlier in the film. There are guards every 10 yards in the cafeteria, a sniper on every rooftop, soldiers in every metro car, but no guards at all in the medical quarantine section to keep watch over the main risk of re-infection. (Carlyle's swapping of spit with his as yet non-medically cleared wife is also a fairly astounding decision on the personal level, but let's assume he's under strong emotional influence...)

Then once an outbreak is verified, the military herds everyone together into one huge auditorium. With any disease, let along Rage, this would be a rotten idea. Why not lock everyone down in their individual apartments and then slowly release all those confirmed as being uninfected once the common areas are secure? On top of that, once everyone is herded into the central area, the lights are then turned off (which incidentally hinders the soldiers fighting the infected much more than it does the infected themselves). Finally, the high security assembly point for the unarmed and unguarded civilians is then breached easily by Carlyle busting through some flimsily chained doors (yes, we know he has high access clearance, but we don't know if the Infected remember how to use swipe cards, and as I said we do not see Carlyle using any sort of unlocking key, just bashing open a door.). He then infects many in the helpless imprisoned crowd, elevating the situation rapidly from outbreak to crisis.

Once we get past these stupendously jaw-dropping moments of incompetence, the rest of the movie avoids any other obvious ""whoops!"" moments, though the durability, mobility, and tracking acumen of the infected Carlyle maybe is a tad unlikely, but the ""lead zombie"" position in most horror flicks is an old and honorable tradition. The great leaps in credulity needed to advance the plot to its mature stages still stand out in the viewers mind, and the script could have been done better to avoid requiring the viewer to make quite so many suspensions of disbelief.

Overall this film is gorier, more nihilistic, faster paced, and more heart-breaking than its predecessor. I feel it is a better horror movie, and the ambiguous though still pungent political overtones add a certain zest to the mix. The cinematography is excellent, the stunts look great, and we see an excellent cast portraying characters we come to like and care about even as they venture deeper and deeper into harm's way. Most of those who liked 28 Days will like this as much or more, and those who disliked 28 Days' occasionally sluggish pacing, limited scope, and tired ""soldiers are bad"" subtext will enjoy 28 Weeks far more",1194912000,2,6188,4.931861804222649
2902927,2,B000TJBN7Q,"Why only two stars? I hated the movie. One star is because I support Zombie movies, the second star is for the fact it's not a HORRIBLE horrible movie/inexscusable waste of 2 hours of life as long as YOU are not the one who pays for it (watching, buying, or renting!). That said...

I loved the first movie. Hands down. So I had mild expectations for this, but it dashed even the lowest bar.

The concept was good. The IDEA I liked. The execution wasn't worth the film it was put on. The plot and ending was completely and easily figured out in the first 30 minutes. The first five minutes was the ONLY good part. The rest went from painstakingly slow to freakishly quick and predictable.

*edit*- spoilers *end edit*

Strike 1-unbelievable, very unrealistic. The fact that so many incidences were because of character COMPLETE AND UTTER stupidity disappointed me. That 2 kids want to go on an ""adventure"" considering the devastation that occured, knowing that people were brutally murdered, knowing how contagious the virus was, having to steal bike keys from the hands of a dead zombie and still happy and laughing?

Strike 2- the fact that they give UNLIMITED ACCESS to EVERYTHING to any of the survivors they found. That would NEVER happen and the fact that they say the military would do that is laughable. The military doesn't even trust regular citizens with INFORMATION, so I couldn't believe they would give that kind of access in that kind of situation and think everything was going to be hunky dory.

Strike 3- The way that they (as in the people trying to save them) knew that the kids could genetically be carriers and were trying to release them over the channel instead of taking them to a base, where they might be killed but had a better chance than on their own, knowing that they could have been infected already (since they found the mother who was also infected and highly contagious).

The other main characters (not the extras, they don't really count) got less than what they deserved. And France too (just kidding! couldn't help it! :D )

2902929,5,B000TJBN7Q,"I say it's a non-zombie movie because in both 28 Weeks Later, and it's predecessor, 28 Days Later, we never actually see a zombie.  The Rage, a primate virus, has infected England's population and turns it's people into maddened monsters that are out for blood.  Just one drop of contaminated blood is enough to infect anybody or anything it comes in contact with.

This film picks up where 28 Days left off.  We're in England and the city has been deserted for about 28 weeks after the events of the first film.  It is now time to repopulate the major cities and try to start life (for those whom survived) all over again.  But is the virus really gone, or had it just been laying dormant?

I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and I'm glad to say that this one doesn't disappoint, it's even better than the original.  Containing one of the coolest helicopter-vs-other-stuff scenes I've ever seen, and one of the scariest/suspenseful night-vision shots, plus a great (although predictable) ending, this could be one of the best horror movies I've seen to date.  I'd even say that this series is bringing back elements to the horror genre that once made it so great.  Most modern horror movies stink, but the 28.. series is shining a light on the genre again that just may revive it to what it once was back in the 70's and 80's.

Both of these films take a limited budget and add good writing, excellent acting, and nice direction to make some great film viewing for all of us.
Yes - ""28 weeks"" does have some plot ""jumps"" that force you to kind of just go along with the flow and ignore some possible plot holes (how can a virus infect in seconds, etc etc) but nothing more than a normal ""zombie"" style movie has done in the past. You will most likely be so caught up in the break neck pacing of this movie - at just about 90 minutes this is one film that for once needs No trimming - that any small concerns will be over shadowed by some great thrill and chill inducing filmmaking.
Bravo to the filmmakers for not holding anything back - no one is safe in this ""world"" and everything can and does change - even up to the credits. I hope the creative forces behind this movie follow up with at least one more - it will be well worth my movie and DVD viewing dollar!

It has been a while since i saw a very strong and intriguing movie like 28 weeks later, out of all those Comic book super heros movies and lame romantic comedies, 28 weeks later stands alone as a very enjoyabale movie,
I just watched it again for the second time on dvd, and i enjoyed it as much as the first veiwing !
What can i say, it has everything : Horror, Action, creepy sets, good acting and simple enjoyable but thrilling plot.
the action was very well done, i particularly loved the sniper - Chaos scene, wow that was very thrilling !!

It should have been a master piece, it felt short from becoming one because of some plot holes, i wish the writters paid more attention to those, it would have made this a true Masterpiece.
But im willing to ignore those plot holes, because the movie has alot to offer that i would ignore the negatives and just enjoy this excellent movie, besides many of the blockbusters out there have some plot holes, one comes to mind is Die Hard 2, it had a lot of plot holes but still is considered a blockbuster movie..

2902946,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's film was done in such a way that a sequel was almost bound to fail. Their film was a horror movie alright, but it was really an exercise in experimental filmmaking. Any film that was to follow it up will have to contend with the cool factor of not just a twist on the zombie theme (even they are not zombies) but the choice in music and look of the film. All I can say is that 28 Weeks Later doesn't disappoint and even surpasses the original film in certain aspects.

Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a great job of trying to stick to the premise begun by Boyle and Garland in 28 Days Later and adding his own signature to the sequel. The film begins with a scene which encapsulates what someone who never saw the original film needs to know about what to expect with this one. We're introduced to Don (played by a gaunt and quite haunted Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) trying to survive with several others at their English countryside cottage just outside London during the first couple weeks of the Rage-virus outbreak. This prologue shows just how tenuous any form of safe haven can be once sentimentality overrides the primal instinct for self-preservation. Don is given a choice of choosing sentimentality to try and save someone he cares about and maybe die in the process or follow the basic need for self-preservation in time of extreme danger and distress. Don picks the latter and we're shown how horrible his choice was but at the same time how plausible a decision it was when put into context. If we were put in a similar situation could we honestly say that we wouldn't had made the same choice which Don took. The scene with Don running across the open field with dozens upon dozens of Rage-infected people chasing after him was quite chilling.

The movie goes through an introductory credit sequence explaining the timeline since Don's escape from the cottage. We're told that the British Isles was quickly quarantined once authorities saw how futile it was to try and save it from the ravages of Rage in the first couple weeks. Following-up on the final scenes in the original film, we know now that those infected by Rage would soon die out due to starvation and that 28 weeks after the first sign of outbreak the world outside of the British Isles have decided that it was now time to clean out the last vestiges of Rage-infected victims who haven't starved to death and begin reconstruction and repopulation of the country. The U.S.-led NATO force in charge of this monumental project is led by U.S. Army general Stone (The Wire's excellent Idris Elba) and have cordoned off a safe sanctuary in London's Isle of Dogs where British citizens who escaped the initial outbreak or were outside the Islands when it began would be housed in while London was slowly sanitized.

This is where Don has been sent and given a job as a manager helping with getting London back on its feet. We're shown the arrival of Don's two children who were safely abroad in Spain when the outbreak first hit England. Their reunion is heartfelt though bittersweet as Don must answer his children's questions about what happened to their mother. Let's just say that Don's explanation is not exactly accurate. The Tammy and Andy (played by newcomers Imogen Poot and Mackintosh Muggleton) take his answers at face value but still end up sneaking out of the protected Green Zone to get to their old cottage to pick-up some items of sentimental value. This is the only part of the movie which seemed implausible and made me realize that once again a horror movie ended up with some characters doing dumb things that would lead to nothing but death and destruction. What the two kids find once they get to the cottage marks the beginning of re-infection and the extreme policies enacted by the military to contain the problem. But containment doesn't hold and soon enough a Code Red order is given to all military personnel.

It is once the Code Red is given that most filmgoers will see the allegorical similarities of U.S. policies and tactics in their War against Terror, especially in Iraq. While I do not prescribe to this notion, Frescadillo handled the situation well. I say I do not prescribe to the notion that the second-half of the movie is a direct condemnation of U.S. war against terror and occupation of Iraq, because it's a theme in apocalyptic movies that's been used before there was a war on terror. It is in this second-half where 28 Weeks Later reminded me a lot of George A. Romero's underappreciated horror film, The Crazies. Just like in that film, the military in 28 Weeks Later don't seem to be heartless about their reaction to the new outbreak and break of containment. Instead their overreaction to the whole deteriorating situation looks to be born more out of desperation and an inability to comprehend the best and most humane way to combat the crisis. As it's always mentioned in other forms of fiction, the military is a blunt instrument and never a subtle one. The Rage infection and those infected seem to only be stopped when using the most blunt procedures and tactics, but such ways also have a tendency to cause much collateral damage to the innocent.

28 Weeks Later is much more epic in scope that 28 Days Later and it is in that which it surpasses the original film. While the first film is more the lives of two disparating groups of survivors and how both groups attempts to survive shows how quickly one could fall from civilized behavior while another continues to hold on to it, the sequel shows that in the end even people with the best of intentions will succumb to the basic instinct of survival with any means necessary. The established shots of London overhead and down on the ground empty and lifeless really brings the apocalyptic nature of the movie with the force of a sledgehammer. These scenes followed up with the firebombing of Canary Wharf really highlights just how much more grimmer and nihilistic in tone and scope Fresnadillo's sequel over Boyle's more hopeful one. It is quite a surprise that its the actions of the youngest and most innocent (as children are usually protrayed in horror movies) which causes a new cycle of outbreak and ultimately the fall of the attempt to bring normalcy back to the British Isles.

I would say that --- even though the movie doesn't really involve zombies but zombie-like people --- 28 Weeks Later actually resembles George A. Romero's Living Dead films more than Boyle's 28 Days Later. While Boyle's film took some of its basic themes from Romero's work, he still didn't go far enough. Fresnadillo took the theme of humanity being more dangerous than the Rage-infected ones during the original film's third act and expands on it with 28 Weeks Later. There's a deep sense of pessimism and cutthroat survival instincts inherent in the film's themes. The only form of humanity to be seen actually comes from the same Americans whose attempts of reconstruction ends up an exercise in total annihilation of the problem even if it includes the innocent being destroyed in the process.

As a sequel to 28 Days Later, Fresnadillo's film shared some stylistic and thematic qualities with the original film, but ends up becoming a wholly independent work (one could watch this sequel without having seen the original and still understand what was going on). Where the original film only touches the surface of the Rage virus doomsday effect on the British Isles and its population, 28 Weeks Later ceases that basic notion and gives the viewer a first-hand look at its aftermath and, later on, how it looks when an outbreak occurs in an area packed with survivors. For a fan of Romero's classic zombie epics I do prefer Fresnadillo's work and the look of his film over the original one, but he does sacrifice some level of characterization to keep the film's tone and frenetic pacing in the latter-half from being bogged down. The film ends on a really downbeat note even as survivors make it to safety. This film really becomes an exercise in nihilism more than what Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were willing to do with the original film.

In the end, 28 Weeks Later brings over enough of what made the first film such a cult, and later on, a mainstream horror success to be considered a sequel that matches the first one in quality, and at times even surpasses the original in certain aspects. The acting is actually very good despite some characters not being fleshed-out more thoroughly, but I find this understandable to keep the frantic pace of the film from start to finish from being slowed down. For fans of the first film I don't think this sequel will be a disappointment. It may not reach the same creative heights for some fans but it surely won't ruin the experience of having seen the original. The film also introduces a new face to the genre world with the excellent work turned in by Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. In addition to Alexandre Aja from France and now Fresnadillo, the world of horror is getting a nice infusion of young talent.",1193616000,,9113,4.727044025157233
2902947,2,B000TJBN7Q,"Quite simply, ""28 Weeks Later"" lacks the narrative jolt of its predecessor. Aside from a truly harrowing getaway scene at the beginning of this sequel that rivals the original, this movie settles prematurely into a rut.  Said rut is chockful of pacing problems, mind-bogglingly large plot holes, and one-dimensional American military characters--their ineptness is presumed to be part of a anti-Bush Doctrine sub-theme (and understand, I'm down with that), but with filmaking this inconsistent who can tell?

A quick scene sums up the direction (SPOILERISH unless you've seen the preview):

A soldier assures two trapped kids everything is alright and exits to check on a noise.  The camera inexplicably follows him to his zombie doom, then cuts back to the kids' P.O.V., as he rushes in to eat them. That it would've been much scarier and tenser had the camera never left the childrens' sides seems kinda Film School 101 to me. And I don't even own a camcorder.

Disappointing sequels are hardly a rarity, but you earn extra suck points when your sequel inadvertently tramples on the original.

2902948,3,B000TJBN7Q,"As sequels go, this isn't bad.  I really liked the original because it created a different kind of ""zombie""--one that had superhuman strength, speed, and anger.  Under those conditions, its easy to see how things can quickly spin out of control.  The horror bonifides of the film (suspense, action, and gore) are all first rate, the acting is good, and the scenario (London being repopulated under military supervision) is definitely plausible.  However, the devil is in the details.  While the story flows well, there are some things that need clearing up:

1.  How is it possible for the military to create an airtight civilian Safe room, but still neglect to secure the back door?  Of all the logical hiccups in the movie, the ease with which the all-important Safe room was penetrated simply had me shaking my head in disbelief.
2.  Picking on the Safe room again, did anyone with half a brain consider how fast the virus could spread in such a densely packed area?  Didn't strke me as too ""Safe"".  Individual safe ""cells"" would have been much better.
3.  A close second was that the Father (who was not a doctor, but a building caretaker) was allowed access to medical quarantine areas.  Also, why wasn't the Mother guarded 24/7 after just being brought back?
4.  Why don't the infected ever attack each other?  They appear to have no intelligence (not even smart enough to eat), but are somehow able to distinguish normal from infected targets.  Perhaps the virus was specifically designed to have that effect, but its never explained.
5.  How is it the infected retain all that energy if they ingest no food and constantly vomit out all that blood?
6.  Lastly, why was there no backup plan that involved putting the fleeing survivors under quarantine themselves?  Or (more directly) even shooting down anything coming from the UK in an emergency.

Yeah, yeah, I know--its just a movie.  But still, its as if the writers consistently gave the Rage virus an EASY button.  The script strains credibility, making an otherwise taunt film seem sloppy.",1193529600,4,2052,4.8530259365994235

2902967,5,B000TJBN7Q,"_28 Weeks Later_ (2007) is a post-apocalyptic science fiction film which is a sequel to _28 Days Later_ (2002) which features the response of the British government to an outbreak of the rage virus which turns men into mad zombies.  This film asks the difficult question as to how disasters should be prepared for and as to what role government should play in restoring order.  The government in this film (run by the American army) is given an ambiguous role to play.  Difficult decisions are required which often lead to the loss of life.  In one particularly disturbing scene, the rage virus breaks out and a crowd of people flee a building as the army officers are forced to shoot randomly into the crowd.  The moral question involves whether such actions are justified in light of the fact that the rage virus is spreading through human contact and that once contracted it leads to blind madness.

This film begins with a group of survivors who are hiding out in an old house.  A husband and wife live together with an older family, hiding from the rage infested zombies.  However, one day a young boy comes to the house and is followed by the zombies.  The husband manages to escape but is forced to let his wife be overtaken by the virus.  The movie then focuses on the man and his children who are being brought back into the country.  The country now exists under martial law controlled by the United States military.  As it turns out however, the man's wife had a special genetic eye condition that enabled her to survive the rage virus, but she still remains a carrier of the infestation.  This leads to her infecting the populace.  The rest of the movie features the man's children and a few others trying to flee the virus as it spreads throughout the people.  Unfortunately, the man himself after making contact with his wife quickly becomes infested with the rage virus.  His children along with an army officer and a medical officer must flee the rage infested zombies.  The movie ends on a highly disturbing note.

This film is good entertainment, but also raises disturbing questions concerning military preparedness and the role of government.  It is recommended for those who like such films and who would consider these issues while watching a movie of this type.",1192924800,,2284,4.722222222222222
2902968,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Spoiler warning: two important scenes detailed.

 28 Weeks Later is a good movie but not necessarily a good sequel to the original.  28 Days Later was concept based while this feature is scene based; in this respect, only two scenes stand out but they are exceptional in their psychological rendering.  The first exemplary scene exploits the fear behind all movies where the laws of nature or human civilization turn upside down and inside out: the anxiety of backward reason.  When rendered with attempted realism, these movies tend to showcase what happens when the exterior world turns on us and all is changed and unpredictable.  When one seemingly logical step, like containing civilians in a safe area during an outbreak leads to infection, death, murder, and destruction.

 This particular scene reminds me of the ""stretta di confuzione"" (usually attached to a finale) in traditional Italian opera.  Usually as an ensemble, this musical number begins small and builds in intensity resulting in a steady pace upwards into chaos and confusion as the emotional state of the characters becomes more distressed with each passing bar.  This scene begins small when the lead antagonist visits his half infected wife (a typhoid Mary comment) and is infected by her kiss.  He escapes her containment room (after brutalizing her to death), then proceeds to do the same to the surrounding military personal.  Once the alarm has been sounded, the civilians of the safe area are rounded up into a ""secure"" indoor parking garage until the issue can be dealt with.  Of course, this space isn't so secure after all and the infected father breaks in and begins to contaminate those around him (in the dark mind you, the power was turned off as a precaution by the military).  The civilians begin to panic and free themselves from their isolation running through the structure and out into the streets.  As they go, snipers/sharp shooters begin to pick off the infected amongst the crowd, building an additional sense of danger to the innocent.  Then, it is decided that infection cannot be controlled so all moving targets are ordered to be killed, infected and non-infected alike.  The inhumanity and upside down reason whirls to the surface as civilization breaks down and destruction ensues.  The finale percussive blow is dealt when the military authorizes fire bombing of the re-inhabited area causing mass destruction and death, although all the rage infected aren't killed.  During these few moments, the protagonists maneuver their way through the chaos in their attempts to survive the developing crisis and inverted events around them.

 The second scene of note takes place when there are only three remaining protagonists who escape into the London underground.  Much of the city above has been cleared of corpses by the military but they haven't made it into the unseen areas of the city, namely the subway.  The only source of vision the characters have is an infrared scope on a military rifle.  They are then forced to navigate the underground in what is one of the most surreal moments in horror/thriller movies I've ever seen.  The oldest, a military officer, looks through the scope of the gun (also the camera's point of view) and gives orders as to where the children should step as they descend an escalator littered with corpses.  This whole scene is an exploitation of our fear of the dark and our sense of escaping an unsafe location to a seemingly safe one that actualy isn't during a moment of high anxiety and danger; this whole portion of the movie is not to be missed, especially since it is the climax of the feature.

 I felt that the sole purpose of 28 Weeks Later was to connect scenes of greatness with lesser scenes of story building and dialogue.  In essence, it reminds me once again of numbered opera where complex ensembles and solo pieces are connected with relatively uninteresting recitative.  The story doesn't move forward overly much in the ensembles and arias but does in the recitative; although it should be mentioned that this particular movie is short on recitative and long on complex numbers.  It is worth seeing for these two scenes alone because they stay with you long after viewing the film, as any good horror/thriller should do to those who watch it.",1192838400,,4299,4.953974895397489
2902969,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Yet one more commentary on man's folly, 28 WEEKS LATER brings us back to that place of stark, stark terror and dead end fortunes: London. It's 28 weeks later, and things look to be safe now for the repatriation of a desiccated city. Fifteen thousand civilians have already been allowed to move in again, under the watchful eye of the U.S. Army. But one survivor turns up who is found to be immune to the rage virus, an immense discovery which could potentially lead to a cure. But it's a double-edged sword, as this survivor now also becomes an Infection carrier - as everyone soon horrifyingly finds out. So, 28 weeks later, it all begins again.

No, this one isn't as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>, which set a new and stylish benchmark for horror. 28 WEEKS LATER, while sleek and scary and shot with vitality, doesn't quite give off that same vibe of bleakness and hopeless inevitability. This one also has a faster pace and more action. But both 28 DAYS LATER and this sequel aren't about saving the world or finding a cure. No, they're about sheer survival, about getting the eff out of Dodge without getting mangled or bitten or gouged or snacked on. And it's about fighting as hard as you can for your loved ones and friends. Because of this, these films tend to affect us more on a personal, primal level. These panicky, desperate characters resonate more with us. We're no brilliant scientists or superheroes out to save the day; we're basic blokes trying to make it out alive. And these films, they'll slug you in the gut.

The premise unerringly targets one fear within us all: fear of the virus, whether it's the flu virus or the plague or, heck, even a computer virus. There's just something so frightening and debilitating about an infection which leaves us helpless and which could spread so widely, rapidly, and exponentially and seemingly has no cure. The monsters here aren't really zombies in the old-fashioned sense. They don't crave to munch on your brains. Instead, they're fueled with an unquenchable and mindless rage. They'll run you down and catch you and inflict massive pain and intolerable violations upon your person. If they happen to munch on your brains, it'll probably be accidental. Another factor which punches up the horrormeter needle is that the Infected aren't slow or shambling like your grandfather's zombies. Instead, these are savage, bestial wackjobs who chase down their victims with electrifying alacrity.

Don't look for the characters in the first film; they're not here. The focus instead is on a tiny band of folks, which includes a sister and her little brother (who also might be immune), a military medical officer, and an intrepid Army sergeant. As they struggle to flee to safety, they not only must elude the murderous Infected but also the military, whose mandate has been drastically elevated to Code Red, which basically means that the fit's hit the shan and now all civilians are considered lost causes. These kinds of films, I really hate it when I find myself pulling for a character. I know the odds are my favorite might buy it at any given moment. It's doubly chancy when you happen to like a lot of them. Those four I mentioned? I liked them all. It's a pity.

You get caught up in the oppresive mood of the film. First of all, the chilling, driving score will make certain of that. And the very good and willing cast won't let you down, either. I started getting that edgy, crawling-under-the-skin feeling right from the opening minutes, and when that knock rapped on that door, brother, I was already yelling at the screen: ""Don't you open that bloody door!"" But of course they did. Then come the first bits of horror. But don't get the impression that it's all remorseless terror and jugular veins getting munched. There are let-ups and times for winding downs, fleeting though they are, and, admittedly, there isn't much respite in the latter half of the film. But juxtaposed with the bloodletting and -curdling are moments of serenity and sweetness, as when Andy and Tammy motorbike it back to their home and we get to enjoy the tranquil, eerily empty streets of London. But, of course, that's only to set you up. There are several disturbing and graphic scenes and a harrowing sequence staged in a pitch dark, subterranean setting, with a rifle nightscope as the sole means of vision.

A bit now on the special features, which are actually worth spending time on: there's the pretty interesting audio commentary by the film's director and producer, both of whom share co-writing honors; 2 deleted scenes (a cafeteria scene and Andy's fractured subway dream) with optional commentary; the 13-minute-long ""Code Red: the Making Of"" featurette; ""The Infected"" featurette- (7 minutes long, and you get to meet the Infected movement advisor); the ""Getting Into the Action"" featurette (7 minutes); 2 so-so animated graphic novels: Stage 1 -""Development"" (7 minutes long - featuring Warren and Clive, who, while attempting to invent a rage inhibitor, unwittingly give rise instead to the Rage Virus) and Stage 3 - ""Decimation"" (4 and a half minutes long - two humans in an Infected-populated London battle it out); and, naturally, the theatrical trailer.

An expert exercise in evoking goose bumps and night chills, 28 WEEKS LATER might also leave you a bit depressed and maybe even wrung out. But in a good way.",1192492800,,5543,4.9935064935064934

The dilemma of the army, what to do, kill them all. It was crazy. The directing was astounding, every shot adds to the tension and the thrill of the movie. The real question is, who's more frightening, the infected or the US army?",1192492800,,361,4.65625

What I didn't like most about this movie was the ""family stuff"". I'm talking about the guy who abandoned his wife when she needed him, then finds his kids, then they find their mom, then he finds his wife, becomes a zombie-tortures the crap out of her and then pursues his kids the whole way through the movie. He ends up getting killed by his daughter at the end but not until after he bites and almost kills his son.

I felt like there was too much of a relational/emotional plot that i didn't want. It makes me wonder was there a message trying to be communicated by the director, writers, etc???

That aside the gore was awesome and the zombie's made my heart race which I enjoy.",1192406400,,891,4.291666666666667
2902972,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Taking place 28 weeks after the events in ""28 Days Later"", ""28 Weeks Later"" is a good sequel that is hobbled a bit by knowing how the infected act, react, what they do, and how they do it.

That's to be expected.  After all, we know who Batman is, and what powers Superman has, yet there is potential for a very good film to be made from familiar material.

Several people have mentioned the huge plot holes.  For instance, here is a woman who has survived for 28 weeks, yet is infected.  Somehow, she is immune to the ravages of the 'Rage' virus, yet is a carrier.  That's possible (see 'Typhoid Mary').  This is the only person ever discovered to have this trait (at least so far).  Yet they strap her into a bed...and disappear!  No patient in real life is strapped into a bed and then just ignored.  And this is no regular patient.  She may represent a cure for a terrible, terrible disease.

And then there is the question, why bring back people at all?  They bring something like 15,000 people back, put them on an island, connected by bridges loosely guarded, and expect nothing to happen?  Why not wait for, say, a couple of years?  Or, perhaps, until they discover a cure for the virus, or a vaccine?

OK, the premise of the movie is what it is.  The question is, is the movie worth seeing?  I'd say YES.

It's scary.  We know what the infected are capable of.  The can do superhuman feats of destruction, trying to kill whatever they can kill.  They are gruesome, they are bloody, they are fast, and they are uncontrollable.

The movie made me jump several times, and held my interest during the entire film.

The movie is all the more frightening when you consider that we have a threat that is facing us right now, that is all too real - bird flu.  The bad thing?  The incubation period is not seconds as it is with the rage flu (handy to tell if your patient is now infected), but days or perhaps weeks.  The infection could spread around the world before we even know it is there.

Be afraid.

28 Weeks Later is recommended.  BTW, the extra features on the DVD are interesting and informative.  All of the actors playing the infected have dance backgrounds, and their movements were carefully choreographed.",1192320000,,2221,4.4638403990024935

This centers mainly around a family and how they react to the outbreak getting inside their safe and protected community.  There are some very tough to watch scenes in this early on, but there was a lot of spirit to get the main characters safe.  There is one scene that was so horrifying claustrophobia wise and the music blaring (that famous music from the first one) that will make your heart pound from fear.  I loved the conflict the soldiers had also, when they were forced to gun everything down.  The actor that played Doyle was great at really making you feel for him, he was so conflicted.

2902987,4,B000TJBN7Q,"The directors and production staff took what could have been just any bad sequel and give it a life of its own.  They managed to turn what could have been a shadow of the first movie into a run little chase movie in its own right.  It was also interesting that they divided the movie into a 28 days/28 weeks later timeline (however briefly) to make the audience understand that the infection was happening in other parts of the country.

All of those involved managed to do this by violating zombie movie rule #1 if a family member becomes contaminated destroy and dismember them immediately.  Of course if they did that we wouldn't have much of a movie.  You also can't ask yourself other inconvenient questions like ""if you escaped rage infected Brittan why in Gods name would you go back?""

The acting from the children was also surprising they in particular did a great job.

2902988,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I find myself kind of confused in regards to a couple scenes in 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the hit 28 Days Later, in where there's quite a bit of gore thrown around. Normally I would chuckle that the filmmakers feel gore will scare rather than disgust and that we will lose sleep at night because of it. Yet I didn't mind it in 28 Weeks Later and even more still, I actually liked the movie as a whole. Wonder what happened here?

About 2 months after the events of the first film, we find that the contagious disease which turns people into mindless rampagers has been contained and there's hope as well with civilians now returning to a selected area of London. But when the virus spreads, scientist Scarlet and military sniper Doyle have to take siblings Tammy and Andy, who might carry a genetic anamoly making them immune of the virus, to safety.

I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the original. Sure it had a good opening, what with a guy waking up to a deserted London, but after that it felt kind of downhill and when they got to the military compound, I got kinda bored. This film manages to keep up its tension and keeps the atmosphere uneasy and creepy so even if the characters are safe, they probably won't be for long. It's also a bit more ambitious scale-wise than the original and while that makes it feel less indie-horror and more studio horror, it still stands on its own.

The problem with a film in the horror genre is that it doesn't really allow the characters to feel like characters but merely munchies for whatever beast is after them. Here it's a little bit different so when a character gets killed off, we actually feel sad they're gone and not just ""oop, there they go"". The film's grounded by Robert Carlyle as the dad who can lie and feel emotional and feels real. Then there's also Rose Byrne who must have a natural sympathizing quality because I never get the feeling she's just going through the motions in anything.

It might not light your world on fire and be your favorite horror film ever (or zombie film for that matter) but it can probably freak you out if it can.",1192060800,2,2120,4.400510204081633

Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world.

Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.

28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.

28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud ""PUNG!!!"" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect.

28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.

It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.

2902992,2,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was a classic.  It was a new and refreshing look at the Zombie genre, and the theme of ""The Last Man on Earth.""  However, 28 Weeks Later was simply an attempt to make money off a well done original.  The movie was had plot holes the size of the Wembley Stadium roof.  First of all, why is the U.S. Army in charge of London?  Where are the British officers and government officials?  Armies place troops all over the world.  Doesn't it make sense that England would recall some of its own troops to London to oversee the U.S. Army initiative?  And, the British Government, like our own U.S. Government (as our Cabinet jumps on Air Force One during a crisis), would have fled London immediately at the first sign of the original rage.  The royal family and parliament would have been safe elsewhere outside of London proper, allowing them to return to govern at a later time?  Where was the British government in the film?  AND, what 6th sense did the Father who contracted the Rage Virus have in order to end up in Wembley Stadium to pursue his children after his children needed a vehicle to get there?  AND, for that matter, if the mother of the children, and the wife of the father, was a Rage carrier and in medical isolation, where was the guard to keep her isolated?  Instead, the husband/father walks in and gives her a kiss to become infected?  WOW!  The director obviously thinks the viewing audience is comprised of complete imbeciles, or perhaps non-thinking Zombies.

The Father tries his best to start a new life and start a relationship with his two astrained children but is burdened by guilt for being unable to save his wife during a bloody zombie attack. (The father plays the tragic character of the film and I couldn't help but feel heart felt sympathy for him.) The quarantine is working and no reports of the infected are announced. The father has a good job as an engineer and things are going smoothly but the children are restless from being bottled up. They escape form the quarantine in an attempt to locate their old home. When they finally find their house what they find there may compromise their lives and unleash the Rage Outbreak once again. 28 weeks is the perfect sequel to 28 days.

2903004,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was a surprisingly great horror treat, and 28 Weeks Later is no different.  Picking up six months after the events of the first film, 28 Weeks Later centers around the United States military helping restore the mainland of Britain after the rage virus has been wiped out.  Cowardly father Don (Robert Carlyle) is re-united with his children (Imogen Poots, Mackintosh Muggleton) while everyone else tries to get back to normal.  Unbeknownst to everyone though, is that Don's thought dead wife (Catherine McCormack) is not only immune to the virus, but has become a carrier for it as well.  As you can no doubt guess, it doesn't take too long for things to get very, very bad.  Though I was a little apprehensive upon hearing that Boyle and original writer Alex Garland were only on hand as executive producers, my fears were put aside when the film kicks into high gear during it's opening sequence.  The cast is more than solid, and features Jeremy Renner (SWAT) as a heroic sniper, Rose Byrne (Danny Boyle's Sunshine and FX's Damages), Harold Perrineau (Lost, Oz), and an all too briefly seen Idris Elba (The Wire) as the stoic General Stone.  The gore ante has also been considerably upped from 28 Days Later, with some impressive and brutal effects.  All in all, 28 Weeks Later is a stunning sequel that surprisingly manages to live up to (and in some cases top) the original film, and is more than worth checking out for horror fans, zombie fans (normal or running), and fans of the first film alike.",1191974400,5,1532,4.7330827067669174

In a way this is the ""Aliens"" to 28 Days Later's ""Alien."" 28 WEeks later has the same texture that 28 Days had, but is in some ways more of an action film than its predecessor. The movie is intelligent, but doesn't explore as many themes as 28Days. No existential dialogs on the meaning of life! Deeper themes are explored through the perfect or near perfect casting of the main characters. --in fact I can't think of a movie of this type where the characters have been better cast than this. Very cool faces here--and the director is able to ""say"" a lot through them. The sets are also very well done. And, when it comes to atmosphere the movie is as good as classic Ridley Scott. Also, we dont' have any of the cheap moralizing that makes most of Romero's films so tedious. The audience is left to make up its own mind--which is how it should be.
I give the movie four stars because--again--the ending isn't especially satisfactory; and things become rather formulaic towards the end. Setting up a ""third"" movie in the series at the end cheapens things.
  While this may be a stretch, part of the reason these films have become so popular is that they reflect the current climate of terror associated with ongoing conflict with the middle east. Both 28 Days Later and 28 WEeks Later are brilliant. Go see them both.",1191888000,,1389,4.507936507936508
2903006,4,B000TJBN7Q,"When I heard there would be a sequel to 28 Days Later sans Danny Boyle I was deeply dissapointed.  For one, a sequel to suck a great film just seemed to be a cheap cash in on the successful low budget first film.  For two, the talent was gone.  The first one had such a good conclusion, that a sequel seemed like it would just sully the original's story.

28 Weeks Later doesn't fall victim to the folly of most sequels, however.  It also doesn't follow standard horror formula, as per the first film.  It's frightening, yes, but this is a film hardly chock full of idiotic one dimensional characters.  At the center is a family - part of one anyway.  Two children just return to see their father after mainland England has been all but wiped out by the rage virus.  They believe their mom is dead and soon discover she is still alive, with infection but without the symptoms.  The tension within the family sets off a series of events that allow the rage to take over once more.

What makes the film successful is that this is not just a cheapened version of the first. It has first rate characters played by first rate actors.  Most notable is Robert Carlyle, as the father who's fear, regret, and lies lead to the virus being unleashed again.  One one side, we're feeling sorry for him, but also want to condemn his actions.  The children are the real central characters as we follow them through the film trying to survive. The actors are incredibly believable in their roles, with the characters continually making more realistic choices than you'd see in a standard horror film.

Largely absent from this film that was in the first are the grander themes that made the first film so great.  There are still some rather intelligent observations on how the government reacts to the outbreak, where the military is seen taking all lives, including civilians.  Throughout the film, we are questioning their tactics and morality.

The only dissapointment falls in probably the last few minutes of the film.  They obviously intend to spin this off into a franchise, but the last moments of the film make me feel like they may ruin what they have by creating run of the mill zombie pics.  However, it's only a few minutes we're talking about.  The rest of the film is dazzling, down to the attention taken to effects, music, and ambience.  It may turn out to be the next 'Living Dead' type horror franchise, continually pleasing.",1191888000,,2428,4.610722610722611
2903007,2,B000TJBN7Q,"I thought the sequel was going to be better, but it was so predicted. In other words, you could guess what would happen in the movie. Some parts were so silly. The movie needs more originality. This movie reminds me of Resident Evil.

The writers needed to put more reality to the sequel. For example, why would you want to go down in a subway tunnel when there is no light, food, protection, or nothing. It does not make sense. It is a stupidity...

Don't even buy the movie. It is not worth it. If you want to rent it, OK. I think there are better movies available than this movie.",1191888000,3,583,4.243243243243243

However, you can tell that the original director is not at the helm.  Also, much of the action is repetitious rather than necessary for the plot.  As well, the military does such stupid things that you cry out for a smart civilian (like a movie reviewer?) to give them some advice on what to do with these raging people and the innocent uninfected ones.
In a really stupid move, someone ends up spreading the disease to France by the end.  Dumb soldier!  Dumb! Dumb!

2903009,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Okay, so here's the thing, i really did not like 28 Days Later. I saw it because of all the hype about the film and really, i didn't find it scary that much. So naturally, i was hesitant on seeing the sequel, 28 Weeks Later but after words, i regretted ever saying it.
The sequel, i feel, is a vast improvement over the first one. The plot of the film takes place, fittingly, 28 weeks after the first film. By now, all of England has been de-contamined and London has already begun repopulation with the help of the US army. All things seem to be going well but when two kids venture out of the 'safe walls', they inadvertly cause a breach in the defense of London and when night comes, the virus will have begun to spread again.
Not only are there some pretty tense moments but there are also some pretty thrilling sequences as well. By far, my favorite scene would have to be the subway sequence, where the film maker uses a very unique film technique that produces a very narrow film view that adds the tension of the whole scene.
The film can also be viewed as an allegory to our modern day goverment and how there decisions tend to work in their favor over the general population.
A very satisfying sequel and definently a scary movie to watch at night.",1191888000,,1258,4.357446808510638
2903010,4,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later boasts a fantastically intense opening sequence, and with it a promise of a relentlessly paced thriller. And director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo delivers exactly that. Outdoing the intensity (and certainly the gore) of its predecessor, the sequel retains much of the jumpy scares and all of the terrifying zombies, but focuses more on visceral action and horrifying violence, and brings a welcome unpredictability to its frenzied survival story. 28 Days Later you may fear those corrupted by chaos. 28 Weeks Later you will fear those infected by Rage.

Twenty-eight weeks after the initial Rage Virus outbreak finds London occupied by the American military and a heavy quarantine in place. Those that survived begin to rebuild their world in seclusion, and after several months of no sign of the virus and all those originally infected dead to starvation, hopeful tranquility appears to return. But such serenity was not meant to last, and when a father with a dark past is reunited with his children, tragic events unfold that rapidly lead to another outbreak of the Rage. Once again an epidemic of voracious zombies threatens London, and those trapped between the ruthless military and their drastic precautions will find little solace amongst the carnivorous abominations that roam the streets.

When 28 Days Later premiered, horror fans the world over praised it for its new breed of zombie with a familiar penchant for human flesh, but also a new, extremely aggressive and violent temperament. Combined with an enhanced agility and speed, Danny Boyle's unique twist on the undead fiend became far more terrifying than Romero's original design. While Days used his vicious creatures almost as a backdrop for the more diabolical workings of his corrupted military, Weeks takes full advantage of these cannibalistic crazies to produce some truly shocking horror scenes. The opening sequence perfectly outlines just how deadly the infected are as they overwhelm the small group of survivors and dispatch them in a quick and brutal fashion. From there each encounter becomes even more panic-inducing as Fresnadillo utilizes several ingenious tension-building devices, from the shaky handheld cameras to the foreboding music. One standout scene finds the protagonists in a pitch-black subway station with the only light source being a sniper rifle night-vision scope. In a wonderfully chaotic moment all hell breaks loose and we are witness to a riveting fight for survival where we feel as helpless as our heroes thanks to Enrique Chediak's camerawork and the frantic editing.

With the increased zombie screen time comes a far higher level of blood and gore and both are handled well to enhance the gravity of the survivors' plight. Throats are torn, eyes are gouged, and heads explode to reveal a sadistic amount of bloodletting that will have gorehounds cheering and the squeamish fleeing. Partway through the film a helicopter decapitation reminiscent of Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror can be found, but here it's no longer an over-the-top splatter of body parts, but rather an exercise in some truly horrific bloodshed.

Though different in focus from its predecessor, 28 Weeks Later builds upon Boyle's original concept to create a terrifyingly appropriate sequel that carries on a series of horror films that redefines the zombie. No more are the shambling, brainless denizens of the night - here the undead possess an unparalleled speed and ferocity that only the most heavily armed (and fortunate) can hope to escape. Arguably superior to the original, 28 Weeks Later is a triumphant return to a remarkably frightening world lost to both those in power and those immune to it, where death can descend upon you in the blink of a bloody eye - if you're one of the lucky ones.

The first was awesome, but this film comes along and tries to ruin wh hard to follow (the plot is so at the first did.
It's hard to follow (the plot is so full of holes)
It's poorly shot (The first one was innovative atleast, this one contains a 15 minute handheld nightvision shot) I believe the camera man was having a seizure

Way to ruin a franchise!",1191715200,,461,4.2988505747126435
2903012,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Ok, let's get started with the nitty-gritty. I did enjoy 28 Days. However, the biggest plot holes in the whole series actually came from the first one in my mind. Ok, it's Boyle's baby, right? Well, certain things don't make sense to me. First, the virus is called ""rage."" They certainly didn't seem very aggressive to me. These are supposed to be mindless killers, but it's like they all waited to attack the farmhouse at the same time, like plotting their own ""lets kill or infect everybody right...NOW!!!"" strategy.

28 Weeks, in my mind, showed the infected in their true ravenous form.

Second, where was the action in ""Days?"" Only a couple of friendlies actually died. The infected turned into semi-good guys later in the movies when they killed all the soldiers. So what? Everybody hated them.

Lastly, why didn't they cannibalize on each other? If the infected were starving, it would make sense that a virus called ""rage"" would eventually get the infected into a state where they would attempt eating each other. Someone with the disease can't get any more infected than they already are, so don't give me that ""it's because they only go after non-infected"" crap.

28 Weeks works so well where its predecessor failed. Yeah, waking up in an empty London would be hella scary, but they didn't go anywhere with it. This sequel lets us see what kind of carnage the infected can truly inflict.

Oh, and on the military as being morons front. Who would know what to do if you're dealing with a virus that nobody has the first clue about when the guy who made it was killed? The husband in the movie made a lot of sense to me...if you realized just how much you missed someone, I'd get over zealous as well. The only hole I found was in leaving that woman alone. Otherwise, I love this movie.",1191715200,,1794,4.61128526645768
2903013,4,B000TJBN7Q,"I'm a big fan of the ""Night of The Living Dead"" series,but alot of these other movies who are trying to catch the same fire as the series miserably fail.

Not this one and this sequel,these particular virus-infested are more deadly,faster and pure savages. The storyline was much to be desired but better than most. But honestly when you go see these movies a storyline is the last thing you're thinking about. You just hope it's not another blood fest and there is some actual good visuals and scare out your pants moments.

28 weeks later has all of that,the only problem is whoever the camera man or the cinematic director should be not allowed to work on the third installment. The camera is all over the place,maybe to give you the feeling of being right in the depths of hell but it's little bit too much.
At times you might have to look away not because of gore but fear of motion sickness.",1191628800,,897,4.463414634146342
2903024,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Taking a play from the George Romero zombie-movie book, 28 WEEKS LATER--the sequel to the 2002 successful zombie picture 28 DAYS LATER directed by Danny Boyle--has none of the original characters from the original picture. Instead, the film revolves around new characters living in England in the aftermath of death and destruction caused by the Rage virus.

The picture begins during the time period of 28 DAYS LATER with a group of unaffected citizens attempting to survive in the English countryside until those infected with the virus die out. It looks like they will make it until the cottage they are staying in is attacked by a horde of zombies. A small battle ensues, but the survivals are outnumbered. Some of the survivors, including Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle) and his wife Alice (Catherine McCormick) try to make it to the escape route, a boat on the river. Things go terribly wrong and Catherine is attacked and bitten by the creatures. Thinking only of himself, Donald leaves his wife behind and succeeds in escaping down the river.

The movie then fast forwards seven months after the initial outbreak. The virus was contained and didn't escape the country of England. Those infected died within a few weeks. With the help of the United States military, the country is in the very initial stages of rebuilding while scientists attempt to develop an anti-virus should an outbreak of the Rage occur again. Donald meets his children who had been staying overseas in the U.S. and they attempt to rebuild their lives. The Harris children soon find themselves feeling like prisoners and unable to understand why they can't return to their old home since the virus is now contained. They sneak through the safety barrier and return to their old home. There they discover that their mother is still alive. It is later discovered that though she has not been affected by the virus, she is carrying it in her blood. With Mrs. Harris discovery, there is hope that an anti-virus might be developed from her blood. However, no one suspects how far love and guilt can push a person and London soon finds itself in the middle of another outbreak.

As far as sequels go, especially a zombie movie sequel, 28 WEEKS LATER is especially well done. Starting with the prologue that introduces some of the main characters and ties this film to the events from the original, 28 WEEKS LATER does an excellent job of remaining true to the mood and tone of 28 DAYS LATER, yet, sets up a completely different story that stands strong on its own. A person doesn't need to see 28 DAYS LATER to be able to enjoy 28 WEEKS LATER.

Personally, I was initially reluctant to see 28 WEEKS LATER because it wasn't directed by Danny Boyle (though he did direct some of the second unit filming). But after hearing positive remarks about the movie from close friends, I'm glad I saw the picture.

Recommended for anyone who has seen 28 DAYS LATER and people who like zombie movies.",1191542400,,2959,4.771484375

2903026,2,B000TJBN7Q,"If you are a hippy you will love yet another movie that shows the military as nothing but complete morons. If you have ever served in a war you will cringe through half of the movie.

 The Good: There are a lot of zombies, and you get to see a good section of a city being destroyed. Plus mass panic and all that. The highlight of the movie is a helicopter VS. zombie scene. Plus there is a decent and plot this time.

 The Bad: Like in so other zombie movies I will not name, there seems to be a master zombie that is just as brainless as all the others, but he keeps showing up anyways and never gets sidetracked or killer in any time of crossfire while he is leading an attack (by leading I mean up front, not in the back directing orders).

 The Ugly: If you are using lethal gas on a city, I guarantee there is no need to have teams of guys with flamethrowers walking through the gas trying to look cool; the gas will be just as fatal without their assistance. Delta Force snipers are pansy's with poor aim and snap at the first sign of trouble. Plus, the zombies no longer require oxygen, this is a small detail, and in most other zombie movies it would work, but the basic plot of this one goes against it.

2903029,3,B000TJBN7Q,"Most sequels are the cud that cattle spit up and chew again before digesting it in their second stomach--a rehash that takes all the best elements of the first film and robs them of flavor. This sequel is quite good at avoiding the cliches that dog most films of this type and the writer/director avoids rehashing the first film taking an original story related to the first and exploring the aftermath of the viral outbreak. The director uses many of the same techniques that director Danny Boyle used on the first to create a vibe of immediacy and reality in the action that we see and expands on this creating a sense of quiet dread.

The film follows two children who are returned to a ""safe haven"" community established by the military in London. It seems that one of the children (Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots) may have some sort of genetic immunity to the virus which interests of a military scientist (Rose Byrne also in Boyle's ""Sunshine""). Their father (Robert Carlyle)survived but their mother may still be out there with the infected. When the children disappear outside the city's safe area to look for their mother they risk infection and death prompting the military to look for the children.

We get a commentary track from the director and producer. Deleted scenes with commentary by the director, an animated short that acts as a prequel to ""28 Days Later"" and one that acts as a bridge between that film and the sequel as well as a multi-part featurette on the making of the film.
Fox has done a nice job with the extras. The screener I received suffers from digital compression problems but I suspect Fox will solve those before the finished product hits the street on 10/8 (edit: 10/13as a follow up--the final DVD version released looks just fine).

Let's be honest here if you watched the first film and didn't like it or thought it was no big deal chances are you won't enjoy the second film. ""28 Weeks Later"" doesn't just try to replicate the first film but expand on its story in a meaningful way. The filmmakers are pretty successful in what they try and accomplish with this imaginative sequel. It's not a radical departure nor is it a rehash of the first film. Fans who enjoyed the first film will enjoy ""28 Weeks Later"" although the characters aren't quite as well drawn as in the original film.

Both this film 28 Weeks Later [Blu-ray]and 28 Days Later [Blu-ray]are available in the Blu-ray high definition format as well with similar features. I'd recommend this as it is a entertaining thriller with some fine performances.

""I wish Roger Ebert was still writing reviews because he would most definitely decry the ""idiot plot"" moment of ""28 Weeks Later."" It comes when Don (Robert Carlyle) decides to plant a wet kiss on his obviously exposed-to-infection wife, despite having seen the Zombies first-hand and knowing full-well how the infection travels and how it has pretty much decimated the population of Britain. I watched this at the Westlake Village Promenade today at 4:50pm with a crowd of mostly teenage guys and even a lot of them were shocked at how ridiculous this was."" - Bryce Zabel, moviesmackdown

Big budget blood drenched sequel could have been so much better. Another ridiculous moment comes when they start firebombing part of the city--gee, why not just nuke all of London, if infrastructure destruction is not a problem, then you could be certain of extermination? Then the city is gassed, why didn't they do that in the first place? Well they have a big budget this time and lots of huge fiery explosions are obligatory I guess.

Another thing, the camera shakes WAY too much. What's going on? When the boy sees his infected father through the door, the camera moves very fast and next thing you know the rage has spread inside the quarantined building. What happened? Only by going slow-motion through this sequence can one see he breaks through a heavy locked steel door by simply banging on it. 300 people are trapped inside but one skinny infected gets in no problemo. The boy sure must be a good sprinter cause he gets from the door to walking over people 40 ft away in .5 seconds. And you know exactly what is going to happen when the rage hits a large crowd of people because it is described in detail in the first film (the airport story). I submit to you, a predictable scene does not make for a scary one no matter how much blood, screaming and unsteady camerawork you throw in.

The original had lots of slow parts with interesting dialog and scenery that made one think and give a breather between the scary parts. This movie just got on the bandwagon of all the bad ultra-bloody films that have come out since the original--Hostel, Saw, Hills Have Eyes, etc and, not to be outdone, is scene after scene of murder and mayhem. The one interesting idea in this one, that some can be immune, is not really developed except to spread the virus to show, you got it, more blood and gore.

The music throughout is THE EXACT SAME as in the original, they couldn't even get original music?? (Maybe they spent too much on those explosions)

Overall this was a big disappointment for me.",1189641600,13,2689,4.650526315789474

It was with a lot of anticipation that I went to see 28 WEEKS LATER - specially because I believe the first film, 28 DAYS LATER, was a genuine new look at the beloved Zombie genre.

But I got a little disappointed with this sequel because it does not offer much. The synopsis looks promising: weeks later, the original infected people on the UK dies... and the country is declared safe. So it is up to the British living abroad to come home and start again. And we meet this guy who has two kids (who were abroad on a school trip).

Suddenly, they find his wife (who apparently got attacked and died on the prologue). But she is fine... because she is immune to the disease. But she does has the virus... and it is only a matter of time until the whole thing starts again.

The problem with 28 WEEKS LATER is that the audience does not bond with any character. There is nobody there for the audience to empathize with. I feel some lack of focus in those characters... and the whole film becomes a escapist time-passing.

It was exactly the huge investment in characters that made the first film so good. But here... It's all missing.

That is not to say that there are not great moments. The intro (when the guy loses his wife) is well paced... the scene where the helicopter decapitates (oh, yes!!!) a group of infected is fabulous... and the best sequence is when the survivors drive away from the military dodging poison gas clouds on the streets of London.

But that's it.

Also... this film contradicts one interesting element presented in the first film. I remember (on 28 DAYS LATER) one character saying the infection had reached other countries. That does not seem to be what we see here. I got a little confused.

Still it is worth a look.",1189296000,2,1758,4.46875
2903070,3,B000TJBN7Q,"I disagree.

28 Weeks Later has such staunch editing that the film seldom allows one to breathe in it's storyline. It is based on a son, a daughter, a mother and a father caught up in the whole virus affecting the world. My only complain and a big flaw in the film is the fact that the characters are not even allowed to grow on you. Before you know anything else, you find characters running and hiding. It's a bit too active and it seems that the director is trying too hard to create an impact.

28 Weeks Later does create an impact, in the sense it is still a must watch film but there is nothing about the film that deserves recognition or respect. It tries to incorporate a whole lot in a space of way less than 2hours. A lot of readers/posters/critics on imdb.com wrote this is one of the best films they saw in 2007. I can see what they could have liked about this film but I must say, in my heart of hearts, it is quite underwhelming.

Watch [...] and figure out how it had those 4minute action scenes. There were maybe 2 scenes in the film that made me jump from my seat. The film,overall, though would still remain disappointing. However, I would not like to pull you away from it. Watch it cause you might just like it or you might just end up finding I make sense to more than just myself.

Try watching ""[...]"" - a good effort and it doesn't try to change the world. I eagerly await the follow up to this film, if any at all. I'll just keep my expectations low.",1188950400,,1475,4.183098591549296
2903071,3,B000TJBN7Q,"What's not to like about zombie triathletes ripping open and converting humans at a rate of speed that leaves the urgency of ""Speed"" and ""Run Lola Run"" limping in a cloud of dust? Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, who previously helmed ""Intacto,"" has infused ""28 Weeks Later"" with a more ""Hostel""-proper level of gore -- projectile blood vomit erupts at regularly spaced intervals, eyeballs get squished and, in a Peter Jackson-worthy scene, a mob of zombies gets sliced and diced by chopper blades in a celebratory burst of gristle, hemoglobin and bone.

There is the obligatory jab at the U.S. empire's reputation for barbarism toward foreigners (i.e., the current war on terror) and, just like ""The Host"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" ""28 Weeks"" criticizes the pitfalls of a technologically murky society. Then there is a misplaced subplot involving a father's cowardliness and subsequent regret that culminates in an awkward scene that begins with forgiveness and ends in blind rage. But primarily, ""28 Days Later"" is about zombie face time. The rest of the film plays second fiddle to these orgies of rotting, human-size, PCP-infused piranha. And Fresnadillo gorges the viewer on zombies until your brain pan's fried. It's not bad, it's just no rival to the flawless ""28 Days Later.""

2903076,2,B000TJBN7Q,"Here's a joke in the grim years after the devastation of the Rage Virus was released from a London biological research lab, ripping through the population like a blood-engrimed scythe & devastating the UK---you ready?

OK, here goes: two guys are chilling outside of the Safe Zone, right? And one guy looks over this brick wall they're standing next to, freaks out, and yells ""Oh my God, it's one of the Infected---he's coming this way!""

And the other guy, he doesn't say anything, but he gets these brand new running shoes out of his rucksack and starts putting them on, tying up the shoelaces, the works, right? And the other guy is looking at him like he's gone crazy, and he says ""what the bleeding 'Ell are you doing? Those things have Rage---they run like they've got a howitzer mounted in their [EXPLETIVES]! You can't outrun those zombies!""

And the other guy just smiles and takes off, saying: ""I don't have to outrun the zombies. I just have to outrun you.""

I made that joke up about 15 minutes in to watching ""28 Weeks Later"", the utterly uninspired sequel to one of the most nightmarish flicks I have ever seen, Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"".

Now it's true that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo had some mighty big directorial Wellingtons to fill: Boyle is a demented visionary and an absolute guerrilla warrior with his directing. Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" could have been a dippy little coda or sideshow to the 2002 onslaught of zombie flicks.

But Boyle brought a silver ewer brimming with gory cinematic deviltry and---of all things!---dignity, to his End of the World flick. The result was brooding, elegant, gory, nasty, & insanely scary, a throbbing mainline right to the jugular of post-9/11's deepest, darkest fears.

The sequel has the same trappings: the Sprinting Dead, zombies who do wind sprints to get you, tear your guts out, and then try out for the Iron Man triathlon afterwards. It has the Military, with their nifty gas masks & black battle armor & Happy Thoughts amped through the City of London, where evacuees have finally been allowed to return, 28 months later, after the American military has cleared the City of the Rage virus.

You've also got the trademark Big Red Clotted Gory Puke Sequences (tm), where the jetting spew is of the extra-chunky Vegetable Soup variety. And there is a sweet, razor-blade instant of pure shrill terror during a sequence of rampant pre-quarantine madness at an English cottage which lopes along after the film's intro credits (though Boyle directed it, surprise!).

Bottom-line, ""28 Weeks Later"" is like a bunch of grad students messing around with lab rats. Dump the Brits back in London; have a few grunts play peeping Tom with the starlight scope; wait for, as they say in Jurassic Park, ""life to find a way."" Life does, the Military uber-FUBARS it, & before you can say ""would you like a side-order of red puke with your order, Sir?"" London is, yet again, crawling with the wild-eyed infected, doing their yark-yarking thing all over again. Ugh.

It's watchable, but only just. Amazingly, the sequel manages to take all that awesome fear, tension, and terror and totally jettison it out the airlock.

But the concept still has promise, which is why I hope Boyle takes a final cut at this thing. However you want to frame it, Boyle's monsters, running zombies are utterly terrifying. The regular Romero-style lumbering dead are bad enough: given enough time & ample exhaustion on your part, they'll get you. But the sprinting dead---these zombies that run after you---that's just too much.

If you don't agree, if you're not feeling it right now, then take a second and just think about the prospect. I just walked through my empty office this evening, out to the foyer, and into the can. I was in there about 2 minutes. I walked back out & the elevator slid open, and two guys---two mechanics, techs for the ventilation system---jogged out, totally spooked me flat-out bugshxt.

I gotta admit, man, it kinda unnerved me. If those dudes had been infected?---OK, you're with me.

Cool. Let's move on.

That's what works about the whole 28 days later thing, what worked about the original, what even worked about Zach Tyler's terminally unsettling reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead"": these undead, hungry, hateful, baleful, gibbering things running at you with murder in their eyes and a-growling in the belly, before you can prepare. That's it, isn't it? You're not ready.

The Running Zombie doesn't give a man a decent getting-ready time. It's like the [NAUGHTY WORD] in hide-n-seek years ago who would pretend to be counting to 100 and then go ""38, 37, 36,---3, 2, 1 HERE I COME!"" and everyone would panic. With a [EXPLETIVE] like that on board, those hide & seeks would become bloodbaths.

So I guess what it all boils down to is this: quarantine this flick. Numero 2 doesn't move, it doesn't groove, it doesn't boogy, it doesn't scare me, & I can't dance to it.

And pray for a follow-up that shows us something *really* scary.

2903077,3,B000TJBN7Q,"I found myself watching another apocalyptic movie this weekend. 28 Weeks Later is the sequel of the 2002 zombie British hit 28 Days Later. The story is somehow, weaker this time around, but it gives us decent amounts of suspense, and the visuals are much better that its predecessor. It's the zombie flick for the 21st Century.

Brief Introduction Story:
A group of survivors led by Don (Robert Carlyle) are hiding in a farm house in the countryside, away from the city and its ""infected"" inhabitants. A child knocks on the door and they let him in, he seems to be ok. All of the sudden, the zombies find the house and start attacking everybody. Don gets to kill some of them, but he is unable to save his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack). As she is crying for help, he leaves her--basically she is left for dead. He runs away and barely escapes from the blood-thirsty zombies.

Six months after the virus stroke humanity, Great Britain is now under the US protection. The US military is now in charge of security. Now that all the infected people have died--apparently--some geniuses decide to bring the population back to a small ""safe zone"" in London. Don and his two kids reunite at last. He explains to his kids--his way--what happened to their mother.

The kids are bored in this self-contained area and decide to go out. They leave the safe zone and go to a restricted area of London--an empty city, a reminder of the terrible things that happened there. They find their house, indeed, but they also find their mother hiding in the house--apparently, she survived the attack. Suddenly US soldiers get to the house and secure the area.

Alice is now in the military base for testing, and unfortunately she is positive. But the unusual thing is that she does not show any signs of the disease. Is there a hope for humankind? What's so special about her? Bringing her to the safe zone is not a good idea anyways.

Review:
28 Weeks Later relies on flashy camera work to give us a futuristic vision of tension, uncertainty and desolation. The aerial shots of London look impressive similar to a war zone with empty streets and wrecked cars. In other words, the photography is probably the best attribute the film has--very realistic, similar to Children of Men. Although the soundtrack was intrusive at times, visuals get a B+.

The story is somehow, sillier than the previous film which was about surviving. This time around, it's more about family values--and dealing with guilt. This family affair sub-plot just didn't work for me. It gives the movie a melodramatic touch that wasn't necessary and because of this, the movie drags for a while. People come to watch these movies for zombie action and I believe the movie needed a bit more of that.

As I watched the film, many questions were wondering my mind. Why would you want to bring people back so soon? Scientists barely know the disease and don't even have the cure. Not only that, they were never sure if the virus was dead. Maybe the Brits were so eager to comeback and start over, but that's not fully explained. Also, the movie doesn't show if the entire country is secured--London is the only place we know.

The Verdict:
Zombie films are getting more ""scientifically"" correct nowadays. Where is all the fun? Give us less drama and more action next time. Visually pretty, but 28 Weeks Later drags and has mildness horror moments.",1187049600,3,3396,4.705387205387205
2903078,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Some say that sequels are at a disadvantage to the movie going public because they take a franchise and turn the familiar and beloved into some sort of bastardized version of what got people to shell out about $10 each to see it on the big screen. Examples are Tx Chainsaw, Jaws, Batman, Superman, Ghostbusters (most of you under 30 or so won't be familiar with the term ""Ghostbuster""), etc.

Don't forget though Sequels usually make more money that the originals.

The upside is that it's possible to take characters and/or situations you have enjoyed in the past and play kind of a ""what if ..."" type scenario that expands the original idea and provides more insight into the original. Thus letting you the purchaser of tickets savor the story you have grown to love ie Harry Potter. Examples would be Spiderman (thank you so much Sam), Blade, Die Hard,X-Men,Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Man with No Name Eastwood movies, aaaaaannnnnnddddddd 28 weeks later.

If you liked the first one it seems like you would like this one because it takes several of the ideas from the original and presents a ""what if ..."" scenario. The difference in the sequels that suck versus the sequels that soar is often the story. Does the sequel REALLY try to extend the 1st story, or is it simply a money making scheme from the film industry. Let's be smart here; Hollywood is about money and the people writing the checks to get on screen what you see on screen want their money back with interest.

There are other things that make a ""successful"" movies  vs a ""box office flop"". Timing of release (Grindhouse) making the movie match the trailer (Primeval) and of course portaying the subject matter in a way that others relate to and become emotionally attached to (300).

Now what would one do to make a successful ""Zombie"" movie in 2007, roughly 40 years after the idea really took off.

How do you rethink what was a rethink or the whole ""zombie"" idea to start with. In fact, the fiends here aren't zombies, but ""The Infected"".

What if you take say a virus that spreads like wildfire dooming you and all those around you that you love and it is secretly being made by government funded research firms.

This virus, once released into the general population, is ""fixed"" by the military, which last time I checked, is also funded by the government. The way the military fixes things is by doing their job: killing people and breaking stuff (no stab at the military here, thank God you're out there protecting my children, putting your own children at risk because of how you understand that freedom is paid in blood).

Thus the govt has needlessly killed all these many people for absolutely no reason other than to find out how it feels to play God and there's noone to control these mad tyrants.

Fear of being alone, fear of the dark, fear of the government, fear of the military, fear of having your throat ripped out by the closest one to you. Danny Boyle and his team are brilliant. The truth about control is often a situation only fools believe in.

This one may not be your favorite of the 2 so far. If you hate sequels then you probably aren't going to like whatever comes next from this franchise. And it IS a franchise.

Please check out the comic/graphic novel related to this series if you want the story to be explained further. Questions like what happened in that 28 days before Jim woke up are answered. Who would make something like ""Rage"" and WHY for God'sake would they try to make it anyway. Was there anyone else working on the ""Rage"" project. What happened to the monkeys. Why don't ""the infected"" just tear each other apart, seems like a vicious circle if that were the case; infected 1 sees infected 2 they fight wounding each other mortally and die in the lab, end of story. Where did the jet Jim sees and at the end of the film come from? How did anyone survive the initial outbreak of ""Rage"", I mean if it's just on the U K Island, the military nukes the island; saving coutless lives at the cost of several thousands.

Oh, I'm sorry was I raving, to quote a great line from Exorcist 3.

Watch the movie, the first 6 minutes of the movie are absolutely incredible!!!! The moment when John decides who he is saving in the upstairs room ... the guy should win an award just for that one single moment when you see the look on his face and know he has to figure out in nanoseconds what is most important to him in life ... it makes me shiver and say ""by the grace of God go I"". Iknow I've watched the 6 minute opening on youtube at least 20 or so times just to see that expression on John's face and be able to read his thoughts.",1186704000,3,4640,4.468085106382978

The moment you realize the plot involves children-in-peril you know the story is headed in the wrong direction.  Would the US government really allow children to settle in a highly dangerous compound?  Well, maybe yes, but only in a movie that disregards plausibility.  If security of the compound is so critical, would it be that easy for the children to escape the quarantine?  This leads to one of the most incredible coincidences in movie history, followed by what can only be described as ""cinematic-stupids"" when the most dangerous prisoner in the compound is left unguarded.  Its better to savour the original than watch this mess of a movie.",1186444800,6,762,4.960629921259843
2903080,5,B000TJBN7Q,"So the going rule in Hollywood is to always make the sequel a piece of junk and people will see it anyways because the first film created major hype....so this is where the whole, ""a sequel is never as good as the first"" ordeal comes into play....Whopsee...someone screwed this up royally.  In fact, 28 Weeks later is not just as good as the original, but probably better, at least in my opinion.

I was a grand fan of the first film (minus the ending and some cheap plot planning), but needless to say, I was even more impressed by 28 Weeks Later.

So what works here?

The Plot - First off, they did an incredible job of mixing it up a bit. I guess they're stating a trend now in the film industry, where some talented people are allowed to experiment and throw out some genuinely new things. Case-in-point...I never expected some of the twists that I saw in this movie. If you're sick of the same old endings, the same old hero movies, this one will rock your socks off. It's basically like Saving Private Ryan with zombies...well done.

Special Effects- Obviously big-budgeted, so I don't have to go into too much detail here. You can expect the pros. However, I want to add that they had some good effects and some rather questionable ones. But the mix doesn't really upset me too much. Overall, you get a great dose of zombie gore.

Camera- Well, on a pro movie, you'd expect pro things, but sometimes they'll throw in a little bit of cheapness to bring out that classic effect. A lot of the camera-work in this film was handheld...and not too steady at that (feel a headache coming on?)...eh, it's not that bad. It's that amateur edge that almost makes it feel as if it was shot by a trembling newscaster from time to time. They didn't skimp on the cranes and pods, but it was an interesting effect that for the most part, I enjoyed.

In any case, the huge sets, big guns, extreme action, and wonderful plot twists make this an excellent addition to any horror film collection...and obviously a must have for all zombie fans. It's probably the only movie I'll pre-order this year...",1185753600,3,2089,4.51058201058201
2903081,5,B000TJBN7Q,"For some reason, the way the infected chase after their ""prey"" in this movie is eerily realistic. They run upright, ""eagerly,"" and with all their might. They turn the corner to reveal their numbers, a massive crowd of bloodthirsty, demonic-looking infected beings, with no intention other than to rip open their victims. This movie, somehow, captures suspenseful horror in a way that I've never seen. The creepy, gothic sounds from the band Muse add to the darkness of this film. It's just so odd the morbidity... I can't pinpoint exactly what makes this movie so morbid (although, that's the plan of the director). The military portrayals are top-notch realistic, comparable to the movie ""Children of Men."" I hate movies with loads of gore and blood, but the mere artistic value of it makes it one of my favorite movies. I mean, if something like this were to really happen in reality, watching this movie shows us exactly what it would be like, truthfully. It has a sort of ""Resident Evil"" vibe to it, while also adding a lesson in why we shouldn't tamper with biogenetics too much.",1185580800,18,1084,4.802139037433155

2903083,5,B000TJBN7Q,"When I heard that this was coming out, I was not expecting much. The original is arguably THE zombie classic (discounting the hysterical ""Shaun of the Dead"") of the last decade, but the sequel involved almost none of the original minds that brought us the stark terror of ""28 Days Later"", which combined the threats of cataclysmic disease and it's deadly effects on the mind which caused those infected by what became known as the ""Rage Virus"" to viciously and relentlessly attack the uninfected, either killing the victim or spreading the disease.  A sequel had potential of course, but it seemed like it would be a by-the-books popcorn affair. Boy, was I wrong.

People complained that the first film started too slowly and was boring for the first twenty minutes; I disagree, but that issue has been addressed nonetheless. The opening sequence flashes back to another group of survivors during the original outbreak.  Their fate is one you won't forget; it is startling, chaotic, terrifying, dramatic, hopeless, and heartbreaking, all within one fairly short chain of events. That's when I knew this one was going to be everything I wished it would be and it never let me down. This film is epic and personal, gruesome yet tearful, and manages to give you everything you want, even when you had no clue that you wanted it.

The evolution of the Rage Virus is a fascinating one in that it manages to outlive the death of all of the infected (from starvation) by exploiting a rare gene that allows some people to be carriers of the virus without succumbing to it's effects. The result: even kissing your wife hello could be the catalyst for a new, deadly outbreak. The story kicks in 28 weeks after the infection dies and the US military is overseeing the repopulation of London; or a district of London to be precise. Every possible step is taken to ensure that the horror that was the infection that wiped Great Britain's population clean off the earth is not repeated. Naturally, the virus finds a way. As the crushing mass of humanity flees from the compromised quarantine and the murderous zombies, there is an amazing scene where the rooftop snipers are frantically trying to distinguish the civilians from the infected as they run down a bottlenecked street. The chaos and hopelessness of the situation are palpable as the camera shows us through a soldier's scope just what he is up against in dramatic fashion.  The way that these situations of large-scale human terror are turned into personal struggles is what makes this movie a stone cold classic in my mind where it otherwise would have been just another great horror film.

The cinematography impresses as well.  There are plenty more of those iconic shots of deserted London that bring back memories of the first film and make me wish I lived there so I could appreciate them more.  Another nice touch.  And the final shot of the film, while not unexpected, is one that will chill you to the bone and thrill you at the same time.

I've spent significant time trying to think of a horror sequel that surpassed the original so superbly and I honestly can't think of one. The closest would be the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but I still prefer ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Dawn"" so ""28 Weeks Later"" takes it. This is an absolute take-no-prisoners, hard ""R"", work of terror that must be viewed by all professing to be horror fans.",1184803200,130,3396,4.740677966101695
2903094,4,B000TJBN7Q,"While all these other reviews make legitimate points concerning this film, they do miss one (from what I've read).  How is it that the two people responsible for bringing the 'Rage Plague' into the quarantined area are treated like heros?  (And if that's a spoiler, then you've been living in a cave!)  Isn't all the blood and carnage which subsequently ensues (granted, the best part) technically their fault?

  Ok, so it's just a horror movie, I get that part.  But still, I find these two pivotal roles less then sympathetic.  And I feel more story could have been developed before the film went into 'Automatic', churning out all the screams & gore.  Of course, it is fairly easy to over look all that when the on-screen-action is busy leaving you breathless (verging on numb).  Still, despite it all I suppose 28 Weeks Later is one of the best Shock Horror movies to come out recently.  Now that's scary.",1182211200,,910,4.69620253164557
2903095,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later provides a worthy sequel to the original 28 Days Later, and maintains the same frenetic pace, music style, filming look, and edge-of-your-seat thrills that were provided by the original. It doesn't disappoint.

The filme begins with a great scene which is assumed to have happened at the same time as the original movie. We find Don, Alice, and several others attempting to squeak by in life, scrounging on what they can, hiding in a dank, dark basement of an inner-city cottage of sorts. The windows and doors are boarded up; no light gets in. They don't want those infected by the Rage virus to realize that ""normal"" people are inside.

Unfortunately, however, they are discovered, and their quiet, safe cottage soon becomes a source of carnage and chaos. Don is forced into self-preservation mode when an infected person is placed between him and his wife. What makes the decision especially difficult is that Don is right next to an escape route. An exciting start gets even more interesting when Don decides to abandon his wife and make a break for it.

As he makes his way out of the cottage, he looks back to find his wife screaming for him, and looking at him through a window. The anguish is written all over his face as his wife is taken down by the infected, but he continues to make his escape, running as fast as he can. Naturally, he begins to get chanced by the infected, and a great fear of someone being chased is realized: open fields with no escape route are not the preferred location.

After Don's escape, where he has to yet again make a decision to leave someone behind and display the truism in today's cynicism, the movie ties up the loose ends of the original. The British Isles, just as Jim and that soldier who was chained up along with him suspected, have been quarantined, and the Rage-infected people are left to die of starvation. Well, 28 weeks later, the world decides that the outbreak has contained itself, and the time has come to rebuild society on the British Isles.

The cleanup effort contains all you would expect: a large military presence, burning of bodies, reconstruction, creation of order, and repopulation. The U.S. Army and its NATO allies hold strict control over the logistics and the mission. It's still not safe, and only an isolated area of the island where the majority of the cleanup has occurred will be inhabited. Most of the repopulation is comprised of those who were off the island at the time of the original outbreak, or at least those who made it off.

Don is placed in this location as a manager of a building of sorts, and his children are part of the repopulation process. We're shown the happy reunion and we find out that the children were in Spain when the Rage outbreak began. It's only a matter of time before his children, Tammy and Andy, ask about their mother, and Don, naturally, lies to them, telling them he tried to help her but the Rage-infected people got her. He sells it really well, though, and they believe him.

Unfortunately for Don, the movie had to progress, and the Rage had to reappear; otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie. So, naturally, Don's children escape the quarantined zone to travel back home. There are some items they want to get, specifically a picture of their mother, so that she is never forgotten. It turns out that their mother isn't dead, and Don, as well as involved scientists, have some 'splaining to do!

It turns out that the mother has the Rage virus, but is somehow immune. This tidbit of information should have been passed to Don, because he clearly wants to make amends, explain himself, and be ""close"" to his wife. And, thus, the outbreak begins anew.

From there, disorder and confusion ensue, with the military unsure how to handle the rapid spread of the virus, especially when fueled by a frantic, scared, panic-stricken population. The military is forced to go into a ""Code Red"" situation, and that is almost always a bad thing for the bad guys. ""Code Red"" in this movie means using a sledge-hammer to kill a fly, and the military does a pretty good job of killing the fly. It's just too bad that it's not 100% effective.

As a result of the slight military inadequacies, we find a cast of survivors, which include the children and their doctor, as well as one of the Army snipers, running to the safety of a helicopter extrication at Wembley Stadium.

The film ends on a somber, downtrodden nature, as we see the helicopter, which has presumably crashed, in Paris, France, and the Rage virus has spread off the British Isles.

It's a worthy sequel, with much of what made the original such a cult classic. The only real negative that I can mention is that there are parts of the movie, in the director's effort to convey the incredibly frenetic post-outbreak chaos, that have very shaky, unstable, even distracting filmwork. It's as if the filming was done during an earthquake and there is absolutely no stability. Otherwise, the style, theme, sound, feel, and if possible, even the smell makes the viewer think of the original, and in that effort to be true to the original, this film is a resounding success.",1181952000,,5154,4.6703417861080485

2903098,3,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later is one of the better, more serious horror films ever made.

But since its premiere, lesser zombie films have rushed to trade on the Zombie film's reputation. First there is Shaun of the Dead, a Brit kitchen sink comedy that shows us the lighter side of zombies and even how to deal with them if one ever encounters a real one.

Fox and the Brits are back with 28 WEEKS Later, a decidedly weaker effort than Days, with Iraq War failures intermixed with dabs of Family Values. The movie is bad but the politics are the cheekiest since the Full Monty.

What remained of Brit forces, wiped up the carnage of 28 Days Later. But this bigger production demands a mightier crew: Yes, I'm afraid they've brought in the Americans. The US Army with all of its smugness intact is ready to screw it up and make a mess. This way, see, we don't just have just a zombie movie here but a metaphor for the joint British-American Failures in Iraq.

Lets not forget family values. Robert Carlyle seems a bad choice for the father of two little girls. After all, Carlyle abandoned Frank and Malachy McCourt., left them to fend for themselves in Limerick Ireland. Carlyle wandered off to England for good when wife Angela and the family became a burden in Angela's Ashes. Also, he didn't provide the greatest fatherly example when stripped to the essential Full Monty in the movie by that name.

Six months after the quelling of the Zombie invasion, civilians return to the boroughs of London to find US Army helicopters circling over Big Ben and the Thames, and US Army sharpshooters on the roofs watching for re-emerging zombies to return for another blood feast.

Despite the American presence, the yanks in the cast don't seem genuine. Seasoned Americans- I'm one of those- can spot this instantly. Brit actors can fake the accent and the look the ticket in some varieties of American movies, particularly when there are other Americans in the cast. But these 'Americans' have to be modeled after signature American types. These GIS ARE Americans though. They just seem a lot like Brits. Without the f*ck*n' adjective in every three word sentence and the US uniforms, you wouldn't know they were yanks at all.

The problem is really that Brit filmmakers don't know that in a movie like this you make use of stock American types. They've got one guy, the Black US army general who is modeled on the authoritative figure, often cast as a cop, that Ernie Hudson plays in stateside movies. Hudson is macho. He's got all the cool left over from Richard Roundtree's portrayal of John Shaft in 1971 and some menace besides. This guy playing the general in command of US Forces in London is decidedly weak tea by comparison.

Carlyle's kids are angry at him for telling them their mother is dead, but tries to con them instead, saying he only said that the Zombie kissed their mom. When the mom turns up alive, apparently untouched by the zombie contagion, a combination of full-fledged AIDS with Rabies combined, a nurse decides that she and her daughters must be preserved at all costs. Their blood could be the source of a protective serum against the Virus.

The efforts to isolate and quarantine any stray zombie still operating go awry when Carlyle, overwhelmed by guilt for fibbing to his kids, tries to at least straighten it out with the suddenly alive missus. But she really did get kissed by a zombie, and for Carlyle, that's the rub. In the time it takes to passionately kiss his wife, Carlyle is transformed into the most rabid of zombies. He cuts himself a swath of victims-cum-zombies just in the hospital alone, that reignites the crisis of six months ago. Suddenly, the smug Americans on rooftops have to break away from the peeping tom role they've been playing with rifle telescopes and do some serious shooting. But like the Iraq venture, the sharpshooting soon runs amok. A rooftop shooter named Doyle stops shooting, realizing the sharpshooters are now killing innocent citizens, unable to separate zombies from human beings.

Doyle teams up with Carlyle's two daughters who are now fleeing poison gas attacks and rockets from those American helicopters overhead, along with sniper fire from his brethren still atop the city's major buildings. One sniper pumps a bullet into the statue of Lord Wellington in Trafalgar Square as Big Ben strikes the hour. Its all low comedy to make sport of the American GI ignorance of British tradition and landmarks.

Doyle is killed but the two daughters escape to a Soccer stadium where Doyle's friend, a black helicopter pilot, brings them aboard and the craft wends its way out to sea over the White Cliffs of Dover. I can faintly hear the strains of Vera Lynn singing When the Lights Go On Again, as the Yanks, aided by the pluckier Brits, mount a quick counterattack and end the film.

28 weeks later isn't a great film, but its a sly dig at the Bush Administration and the Poodle Acquiescense of Tony Blair.

2903100,4,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Weeks Later is a sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, which was a refreshing zombie film that took itself very seriously and arguably reinvigorated the sub-genre for bloodthirsty audiences around the world...I consider myself among them.  Danny Boyle steps back as director but his influence is intact as he produces this film.  Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, a Spanish filmmaker recently nominated for an Academy Award for his short film Esposados (released in the US as Linked), directs this sequel but maintains many of the stylistic standards of the first film.  Like 28 Days Later the cinematography is digital, and it is in 35mm format with some shaky camera work and some very quick edits.  I have to admit that at times the attack scenes seemed a little over-stylized and one scene was derivative enough from the Blair Witch Project that it came off as an intentional tribute.  Not to say that bothers me much, I'm just pointing it out.

The first film was about a virus called ""Rage"" that quickly turns it's victims into fast-moving cannibals that are a bit more real and scary than the mindless traditional zombies of George Romero's films.  After a while the first film ended with all the infected people starving to death. The second film starts off with a thorough American occupation of London that works to contain and prevent another outbreak while at the same time re-introducing British civilians.  We are then introduced to a family of characters, some of which have a genetic abnormality that allows them to remain healthy with the virus.  They are un-effected carriers of ""Rage"".  This of course leads to another outbreak in the setting of a military occupied London.  And so we sit back and watch as the zombified shenanigans ensue.

28 Weeks Later is extremely violent but it's even more brutal than many films of this sub-genre because it takes itself so seriously and it actually works effectively for that.  We are introduced to several would-be protagonists, two of which are deeply riddled with guilt and that makes the characters three-dimensional which allows us to actually care about them.  But by the same token, the movie doesn't pull punches and the zombies get their way more often than not.  That means the violent tone in general was a bit more real for me.  There is also an incredibly gory sequence that is identical to a scene in Planet Terror, the first feature in the recent collaboration Grindhouse.  It's interesting to compare the two scenes, because in Planet Terror the scene is so amusing and slapsticky while essentially the same scene here in 28 Weeks Later comes off as shocking and disgusting. It is an interesting comparison that compliments the refined style of both movies.

The middle acts of 28 Weeks Later serve as a political allegory of sorts, in terms of the war in Iraq, although I couldn't perceive which side the film is actually taking.  It seemed to suggest both judgements of ineptitude and sympathy toward the American military.  So the commentary seemed kind of inconsequential other than to reflect our modern cultural and political climate, which is firmly in the tradition of George Romero's early zombie movies, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead.  I must say that the commentary itself was so heavy-handed at times that I was really keeping my fingers crossed for that fast-moving Saddam Hussein zombie...oh well, perhaps I'll have to wait for 28 months.",1180483200,6,3439,4.905008635578584

2903102,5,B000TJBN7Q,"28 Days Later was one of those pre-hyped horror films that generated a lot of buzz before its release. I saw the film in the theaters during that hype, liked the film, but I think the hype machine left me with expectations that were extremely high. I appreciated the film much more after I bought it on DVD. The first film is a clever and creepy ""zombie"" film that also touches on the possibility of how we would survive if an entire city was wiped out by some kind of infection.

28 Weeks Later was a differenct story for me. I went in with low expectations thinking I would experience a quick cash in sequel but to my surprise this film was made with a great deal of integrity and respect for the original. It follows that whole theory that the second time around everything is a bit bigger and louder, but it offers us this without compromising the story. 28 Weeks Later is a welcomed chapter in the frightening look of what would happen if we lost control during an outbreak of a violent infection. Needless to say, from a horror film standpoint, this is the best one to come out in awhile.

28 Weeks Later is a direct sequel to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, although none of the characters from the first film have returned. Instead, we follow a new group of individuals from their first harrowing encounters with the infected during the initial terrorizing of Britain to their attempts to repopulate London six months later. Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) have two children, Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton). The kids are in Spain during the outbreak, while Don and Alice are in hiding. When their hideout is discovered by a group of infected, the cowardly Don runs off, assuming that Alice has been killed. 28 weeks later, the kids come home, but it isn't long before it becomes apparent the crisis isn't over. Members of the U.S. military, including the lead medic (Rose Byrne), a sharpshooter (Jeremy Renner), and a helicopter pilot (Harold Perrineau), try to contain the new epidemic but it spreads too fast and too violently, triggering the ultimate solution: Code Red.

This film had me hooked from the start. The opening scene did what no horror film has done in recent memory: it made me jump out of my seat. That first initial break in during the first 10 minutes was exceptionally well done and it really threw me head first into the story. Intense is probably the best way to describe this scene and the film is filled with many intense moments that should entertain the viewer.

Despite all the entertainment provided by the action, the films smaller moments probably are the highlights. The first film did a great job of creating the isolation and decaying nature of London after the infection outbreak. This atmosphere is wonderfully re-created here with several overhead helicopter shots of an empty London, looking incredibly creepy. Both films tapped into my fear of just being alone in a potential situation like this. The idea of this is no different from being one of few survivors if we had a nuclear fall out. I also dug the idea of repopulating Britain but under strict guidelines to ensure that the infected could not break out again. It made me think of what could happen we had to be in a similar situation. The idea of being under such a lockdown is even more terrifying than the infected that are represented in this film.

The acting is top notch from all involved. If I have one complaint is that I cared more about the characters in the first film but since the cast has been expanded a bit this time around, I can see why character development couldn't be properly explored. Actors like Robert Carlyle and Harold Parrineau for instance are criminally underused and we aren't given much insight into their personalities. They do a decent job, especially Carlyle but they aren't given enough to do. The children played by Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton are truly the only characters who garner our sympathy and they do a damn good job of it too. Not merely because they're children but because they do a great job of making their characters believeable and easy to relate to given the situaton. Jason Renner and Rose Byrne also provide adequate support with Byrne creating a female character that is strong and believable.

I want to talk a bit about the shakey cam because in most reviews I read, even those that liked it, many people have complained about the shakey cam. I'm not a fan of this device. I think quick edits take away from the action taking place on screen and it also makes it extremely hard to tell what's going on. The action scenes in Batman Begins are an example of this. I love that film but my only complaint was that the hand to hand combat scenes were so hard to get into because the quick edits made it difficult to tell what was going on. To my surprise, the shakey cam in this film, added to the visceral experience of the film. There are many moments where it is hard to tell what is going on when the infected strike but the screams of horror and the snarls of the infected was all I needed to hear in order to truly feel the horror of the experience. The quick edits actually made many of the scenes much more intense.  The best example of this is during the code red scene when everyone is looked  down and one of the infected breaks in and begain to infect everyone. The scene is mostly dark but  the intensity of how quick it was taking place, made the scene all the more frightening. The slower action scenes work as well (especially the various sniper scenes towards the end and a very frightening night vision scene that had my theater shrieking a bit) but I did appreciate the quick cuts this time around. You win this round shakey cam!

I think when the summer movie season is over 28 Weeks Later will be remembered as one of the pleasant surprises of the season. I'm not sure how well it will do financially compared to the original film since the horror genre has been milked to death between 2006 and 2007. If the film doesn't register in theaters, I think it will definitely find a great home on DVD. This is a welcomed companion piece to 28 Days Later and it's a truly frightening experience that did not disappoint in the slightest. Definitely recommended.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>",1180137600,12,6469,4.716814159292035
2903103,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Okay, here's the thing.  Few sequels are better than their predecessors, and in my humble opinion, one should never go into a theatre to see a sequel with the expectations that it will surpass that predecessor.  Historically, that just doesn't really happen.

This movie is getting a lot of negative feedback from fellow Amazon'ers.  I'm fairly critical of movies, myself, and went into this movie with low expectations.  28 Days Later was incredible on so many levels;  story, cinematography, art direction, acting, dialogue, etc.  I went into 28 Weeks Later asking myself, ""There's no way this movie can come NEAR 28 Days.""  To my surprise and delight, the movie exceeded my expectations, and so I was pleased!

First and foremost, you'll probably notice that this sequel had a MUCH higher budget than 28 Days Later had.  From sweeping air shots, to massive explosions, to being filmed on standard 35mm as opposed to the raw look of MiniDV video (as seen in 28 Days Later), this movie is larger scale.  Some people feel this takes away from the raw, grittiness (for lack of a better word) that 28 Days Later had.  I personally feel as if it's an enhancement; as if going from casette tape to CD, and listening to the improvement in quality.

The film opens during the same time frame as the first movie, but we've shifted to another group of survivors in a part of the English country side.  It's a different perspective of surviving the infection, as opposed to the pseudo-urban feel of London.  After an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride of an opening scene, we flash forward several months, where it is presumed that the last of the infected have starved to death, and repopulation now begins.  Of course, with a clever twist, a certain catalyst sparks yet ANOTHER outbreak of the RAGE infection, and the chaos ensues.

In 28 Days Later, the movie starts after all of the large-scale pandemonium has occured (hence the name I guess).  We begin the story with Jim, who is all alone.  This feeling of isolation is what gives the film it's eerie feel, in my humble opinion.

In 28 Weeks Later, you're placed smack dab in the middle of the outbreak, and you can cut the suspense and tension, and all out anxiety, with a knife.  You experience the panic, devastation, and moreso in this filme, the desperation, which were all things absent from the original.  This gives 28 Weeks a different ""feel"" from 28 Days.  It's a different ""dimension,"" so to speak, of suspense, terror, etc.  And obviously, some people don't dig that!  I, personally, loved it.

My advice:  Don't buy into any hype before you see it.  You're more likely to be let down if your expectations are over-the-top.  This movie isn't better than its prequel, but I think it certainly lives up to it.  Not to mention that it's exhaustingly scary, the whole way through.  It REALLY doesn't give you much of a break, as far as ""edge of your seat"" moments go.",1180051200,8,2918,4.718811881188119
2903124,5,B000TJBN7Q,"First of all, don't believe the critics and other morons who poorly reviewed this film. It is bleak and disturbing...but isn't that the way all great horror movies are ? The acting and direction are top notch and the script makes a fluid progression following the events of the first movie. Not to run rampant with my adjectives but this is an extremely tense and horrifying film. This is not for people who like their scares spliced with humor. This is not for dopes who believe that horror movies should be moral fables where the bad get punished and the virtuous sail into the sunset. Real horror, I believe, is like real life - sometimes terrible things happen to good people.

  For fans of zombie movies, this is nothing short of a gift. If you enjoyed Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake and like the concept of fast, raging zombies rather than slow, lumbering ones, this is for you. I know that Romero fanatics think that this is sacrilege but to me, running zombies are infinitely scarier than walking ones.

2903125,3,B000TJBN7Q,"New directors equal different material, and often times, worse material. We see that when it comes to 28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the stylishly original 28 Days Later. It's a solid effot and packed with entertainment, but falls short in terms of the longevity category. When I think longevity, I think of films that stand alone. This is not one of those films.

The concept is nice. As viewers, we visit London 28 weeks after the outbreak and roughly two months after the last incident of infection. The US military is in the process of bringing civilization back to London, as they've sealed off a protected area in the heart of London that has everything from running water to electricity. On nearly every rooftop there is a sniper, prepared for the worse. It seems that the powers that be have thought of everything and are ready for any situation. That's until, of course, SHE shows up.

""She"" is a mother played by the always-gorgeous Catherine McCormack. She is seemingly infected, but at the same time immune. In other words, she doesn't show signs of the disease - like rage - but if, say, someone like her husband were to kiss her, he would become infected and all hell might break lose. And guess what happens?

It's 10 minutes into such a catastrophic levy being openened that I found myself being extremely entertained. I cannot, however, say that the last half-hour of the film was satisfying. As a viewer, I wanted the film to go in certain directions and found that in almost each case (except for a brilliantly executed final 5 minutes of the film), the director had other ideas.

This is not your father's 28 Days Later. This is something else. It's not altogether bad, but when stacked against older brother, 28 Weeks Later looks rather weak and in need of some practice.",1179792000,,1791,4.6761904761904765

Zombie films are not for everyone. You know you are a true fan of zombie films if you were excited for this sequel. I was amongst the few hopefuls. I was let down. Mostly the film and more importantly the zombies did not have the raw, visceral, jacked, amped on speed and crack intensity the zombies from the first film did. This film just relied on shaky camera work mostly. And darkness. A lot of darkness.

Forget the plot. All I need say was that there was a star zombie and a nuclear zombie family. A zombie film with family values.

2903127,2,B000TJBN7Q,"After only five minutes watching this movie I had an almost overwhelming desire to walk out of the theater. I very much enjoyed the original, 28 Days Later, and thought it brought a fresh take to a tired premise; the Zombie Thriller genre. The non-steady cam techniques used through-out most of the film turned out to be nothing more than a desperate ploy by a director who didn't have much of a story and needed something to try and make a name for himself. It was, however, an effective headache generator.

  But I think the true culprit in this movie is the story. The story/screenplay was horrendous and filled with many inaccuracies and cheap thrills. Prime example; the military quarantines someone they suspect to be suffering from a contagious pathogen responsible for wiping out millions of humans and we are to accept that the janitor has unfettered access to the persons cell? The janitor who just happens to be the womans husband? Please! Could they not have come up with something more serious?

  This movie was nothing more than a sham and a mockery of the original. I am surprised Danny Boyle had anything to do with it. I can only hope he was legally required to do so or maybe he thought he could turn around a hopeless cause.",1179705600,,1245,4.636363636363637
2903128,2,B000TJBN7Q,"Calling 28 Weeks Later a story is, frankly, stretching things.  Think of it more as a sequence of scenes, some frenetically frightening and deeply disturbing, some marginally gross in a puerile way, others genuinely boring -- as characters trudge from point to point in search of a ride on an Apache helicopter.

Of the characters, only one is sufficiently unique or engaging to grab the audience, and she, the mother of the family at the center of the film, dies early.  The most interesting stab at character and plot development -- a father's lie to his children about the fate of their mother -- seems full of promise, but ends shortly after take off with a crashing, blood-soaked, and, finally, charred finish. Rather than employing the time-honored idea of a character arc (in which, perhaps, the father ultimately redeems himself through some act of heroism), the father becomes this incredibly controlled killing machine (unlike all of the other infected), which then leads to random, semi-plausible people being chased from one place to the next and dying here and there, all the while haunted a foreshadowed ending that, early in Act I, hits you between the eyes (literally) like a two-by-four.

Let me be very clear, however. 28 Weeks Later has some incredibly scary moments that will stick with you, courtesy of some terrific cinematography and post-production. The ""zombies"" in the film seem real, ravenous, and frightening. The opening sequences of the film are terrific for all of these reasons. And, if that's what floats your boat, and you don't really need much more, you'll likely enjoy this film. Frankly, I found it more oppressive and, at times, boring than genuinely engaging.

I, too, am a life long horror (but not slasher) movie lover, and, in particular, a fan of apocalyptic films like this. But I prefer my horror films to be intelligent and plot-driven, not merely a bag of frights (no matter how effective). In the end, 28 Days Later was superior to this sequel in just about every way.",1179619200,4,2017,4.920588235294118
2903129,5,B000TJBN7Q,"Much more than a horror film, 28 Weeks Later takes the original premise of the outbreak of Rage (the disease that decimated the population of Great Britain) and takes the concept of human vulnerability a giant leap further. The rage victims are as frightening as ever (and for gore fans, there are lots of them in this sequel), but the storyline of rebuilding Great Britain (starting with a ""green zone"" in London) is what's really chilling about this film. Think ""Andromeda Strain"" on steroids.

The way this film was shot and edited is superb. The quick cuts and frenetic action makes you feel as if you are being chased and mauled. The acting is wonderful, and the writing is top notch. I'm a complete horror junkie -- everything from Herschell Gordon Lewis and Dario Argento to Ji-Woon Kim and Takashi Miike. But 28 Weeks Later is one of the best conceptualizations of true horror that I've ever seen.",1179532800,6,905,4.727848101265823
2903130,4,B000TJBN7Q,"You know, ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Resident Evil,"" and too many more to count, including this one's prequel (which I didn't see). It's been done so many times, with pretty much interchangeable plots, that any new one had better be something different.

This one is. The ""Rage"" virus has depopulated England, down to the last howling bloodsucker - as far as the authorities can tell. So, once it looks like all's clear, they start shipping planeloads of tasty expatriots back into the most undefendable, unsecurable part of the UK: downtown London. You can pretty much guess the rest.

Given that everything else in this movie is recycled, novel (or at least well-done) effects distinguish this one. There's a fair bit of red spatter, if that's the kind of thing you like. There are also some great CGI scenes of the military trying their military solutions throughout London - some of the coolest since that big ending scene in ""V for Vendetta"". And, since this flick is really just there to manipulate your nerves, it does a great job with flashing lights, blinding glare, and bouncy camera stuff. One other thing worked pretty well - it looks as if the current generation of cameras has shutter speeds so high that motion blur essentially doesn't exist. Instead, action scenes have a jaggedness that grates on the eye in a way completely suited to the jagged mood.

So that's about it. A plain old contagious-zombie movie with above average effects. I give it four stars for staying loyally true to its genre, not trying to be anything else. If you have an evening to kill, these virus-driven maniacs will take care of it for you.

2903132,4,B000TJBN7Q,"In ""28 Days Later"", Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find a virtually deserted London. He quickly learns the ""Rage Virus"" has swept through the country changing the infected to zombies who hunt for humans to feed on. There are a handful of uninfected people, but their numbers are dwindling fast. He joins up with a group of the survivors and attempts to get out of the city, where the concentrations of diseased are, to the countryside. He and the survivors hope they will be able to wait for help and rescue.

Written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting""), ""28 Days Later"" proved to be an example of what could go write in a suspenseful, well-made horror film. The filmmakers realized the key to success in this genre is to give the audience little glimpses of blood and gore and concentrate more heavily on suspense. It worked and ""28 Days Later"" was a cult success.

I was worried to learn of the sequel ""28 Weeks Later"". In this day and age of `horror films' depicting the most gruesome acts in vivid, lurid detail, I was afraid ""Weeks"" would fall victim to this. I was even more worried when I learned the sequel would be released by Fox Atomic, the genre picture division of 20th Century Fox, whose most famous release to date has been the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and it's recent sequel. ""Weeks"" seemed destined to be a blood bath and gore fest, losing all the elements of suspense that made the first film work so well.

I was pleasantly surprised by ""Weeks"". Surprised in a good way. Director and co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (""Intacto"", a film I am not familiar with) has kept much of what made ""Days"" work intact. With the lone exception of one scene in which the blood and gore fly with unnecessary abandon, the film is surprisingly suspenseful.

""Weeks"" begins a few days after the outbreak. Don (Robert Carlyle) and his wife, Alice (Catherine McCormack) have holed up in a small country house with the two elderly owners and three other survivors. With all of the windows boarded up, they seem to be relatively safe, trying to deal with the shock of recent events as they eke out a living. Then, a little boy bangs on the door and they let him in, just before a hoard of the infected zombies attack the house. Don and Alice make it to the roof, but Alice is soon surrounded. Rather than risk his life, Don runs and manages to escape, turning back to see the look of disbelief on his wife's face just before they descend on her. Six months later, the US Army has secured a small area in the middle of London and are confident they have things under control. So they let some British survivors back, to begin repopulation. Don, in charge of the water and electricity of the area, anxiously awaits his children's return. They were on a school trip when the outbreak started and have spent the last six months in Spain. Tammy (Imogen Poots), 15 or 16, and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), 8 or 9, run up to their dad, excited to see him after so long. They naturally want to know what happened to mom and Don tells them a slightly different story. Tammy and Andy want to go home, to retrieve some lost possessions, so they sneak off the island and commandeer a motor scooter. Searching through their home, they are surprised to find Alice holed up in the attic. An army doctor, Scarlet (Rose Byrne) runs some tests and realizes Alice is infected with the virus, but is not affected by it; she is a host and can transmit the virus through her blood or saliva. Don learns of Alice's return and goes to see her. Then, all hell breaks lose as the Rage Virus starts to infect again. The army attempts to eradicate the virus, but can't control it. Tammy and Andy manage to escape with the help of Scarlet and another soldier, Doyle (Jeremy Renner). Escape is relatively easy, then they have to stay alive.

It's a nice touch the film starts during the same timeframe of the original, introducing us to a new set of characters living through a different version of the same horror Jim experienced.

Co-written and directed by Fresnadillo, ""Weeks"" takes a while to set-up the environment of the story. As Tammy and Andy arrive at the airport, vacant except for the one plane, they make the journey to the secure area on board the Tube, protected by soldiers, riding past soldiers standing sentry, listening to a soldier tell them about living in the new zone. As the subway car travels along the tracks, we see the evidence of the virus as soldiers remove the bodies from homes, stacking them in the middle of the street for disposal. But the remainder of the area is vacant. No people, no cars, no boats on the Thames, no movement of any kind. Once this is done, the film has established the environment the two kids will be living in and the difficulty they will have moving about, surviving, and making their way to safety. This is a necessary, welcome step in the process of establishing a successful suspense film. If we believe the surroundings, or environment the characters are living in, have to escape, we feel every moment of their journey.

How they were able to accomplish the establishing shots of London is beyond me. Street after street is empty of human life. There is no point of the day, except maybe the middle of the night, when any London street has no one or nothing moving along. As the two kids ride the Tube to the protected area, we see street after street, building after building, empty. The city is deserted. The River Thames is vacant.

The US Army is presented as a necessary evil at first. Naturally, there are no British soldiers to help with the containment; the virus has wiped all of them out, leading to the establishment of a ""US-led Nato Force"". Led by Stone (Idris Elba, HBO's ""The Wire""), the force is very efficient and very careful to make sure everyone is safe. Some of the soldiers, Flynn (Harold Perinneau, TV's ""Lost""), a chopper pilot, and Doyle (Jeremy Renner) are bored and get up to some antics, but they are going about their duties. Then, when things start to go wrong, they naturally take the most extreme route and try to contain the problem.

The film uses a series of techniques to show quick flashes of the action, lingering on most for only a few seconds. There is a lot of handheld camera work, most of the cinematography is almost monochromatic in shades of brown, and the editing is fast and furious. The combination of these techniques help to create a unique look, giving the film a bleak, cinema verite quality which also helps to create suspense. As we never linger on any shot for very long, there are brief moments when the camera reveals a little shot of horror. Will an infected person appear at any moment and attack on of our characters? We never know because our perspective is always shifting.

With the lone exception of one scene, the film concentrates more on building suspense than reveling in blood and gore. The majority of the shots revealing blood or violence are just enough to get our mind thinking about it and in many, the blood is black or brown. Horror is always more memorable when our own mind starts to fill in the blanks and connect the dots.

This one scene, just before the virus breaks out again, is bloody and gory and excessive. It almost feels as thought Fresnadillo let's his better judgment lapse and lingers on some of the elements of this tableau too long. We get the idea, yet he holds the camera over parts for what is relatively a long, long time.

That said, as much as I was grossed out, this same scene almost seems necessary. Because so many of the other shots are fleeting, giving us very brief shots of the horror, we almost need something like this to fuel the flames, to provide material for the future brief shots of people afflicted by the Rage virus featured throughout the film.

Yes, there will likely be a ""28 Months Later"". The filmmakers have included a brief scene at the end of the film allowing the story to continue. Hopefully, the next film will be as successful as the first two.",1179360000,4,8054,4.557705597788528
2903133,4,B000TJBN7Q,"Five star reviews go to Star Wars, Godfather, and Lord of the Rings.

Having said that, this one made it into the 4 star categories for being fast paced, intense, and inventive in having two antagonists in The Infected, and the US Military.  Not saying the US Military were bad guys, yet sterilizing a city with fire and cyanide gas while people are trying to escape does make for an antagonist role.  Nobody in the film is safe, the pacing is faster than 28 Days Later (which I loved and also give 4 stars), and the special effects are very good.  If you like a great zombie film, check this one out.  I personally found it very enjoyable.",1179100800,,640,4.389830508474576
