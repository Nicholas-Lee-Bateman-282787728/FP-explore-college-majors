8548558,2,B00A92MFQQ,"This is an amazing anime I've seen many times before ordering the series to add to my collection. It is stated in the description as, Language-Japanese, Subtitles-English. This is not true, however. It is English voice and no subtitles at all. If I had known this I would not have ordered this series here.",1437350400,2,306,4.685185185185185

8548560,4,B00A92MFQQ,"First off, I'd like to say that this DVD is in ENGLISH. I was expecting Japanese with English subtitles, as the description states. Honestly, I was really disappointed about that because I do prefer to watch anime in Japanese. Otherwise, I really do like this anime. I contemplated returning because it is in English, but ultimately decided I still liked it enough to keep it. If you don't mind watching it in English, I would definitely recommend.",1423958400,3,448,4.8311688311688314
8548561,3,B00A92MFQQ,"I was pleasantly surprised by this. It was adapted from a book, and I believe the original author had some truly interesting things to express concerning repeating time loops, immortality, and love versus lust. He also decided the proper vehicle for these themes was feudal Japan, a dystopian future Tokyo, vampires, and samurai. Sign me up.

Our protagonist is a master swordsman. He's being chased by undead warriors and finds refuge in the home of an attractive, mysterious woman who turns out to be a vampire (knowing she's a vampire doesn't take away any mystery). Our hero turns into one as well and some action robs him of his head. He awakens in a dystopian future Tokyo. A search begins for his lost love and the answers to a HUGE past that he has no memory of.

What went wrong?  So much of this is executed admirably, but some small parts are unforgivable bluster and misplaced fan-service. Let's get to it:

***PROS***

STORYLINE
The concept is intriguing and paced well. The characters are not ocean-deep, but instead are governed by primal, relatable desires. It's unclear whether the love shared between the hero and the vampire he seeks is real and timeless--or twisted lust and uncontrollable obsession. The jumping from past to present is tasteful, and the narrative stays cohesive (which is a rarity in anime like these). Also, though vampires are in the show, they are not the center of it; as a result, the plot avoids any of the tired crutches commonly seen today.

ANIMATION
Gorgeous character designs and fluid animation. The battle scenes are vicious. The CG starts to feel clumsy about halfway through, but it's still handled well enough to avoid negative comparison with a Playstation cut scene.

TWISTED
I'm a fan of revelations that are hard to swallow (Berserk/Elfen Lied/Evangelion), and Kurozuka delivers a very disturbing one. It is worth watching through one time, just to confront the ending.

***CONS***

IDENTITY CRISIS
Once the final stage is prepped and ready, some out-of-place humor is injected. It feels unwarranted, but it's still not enough to mess up the plot. Once we reach the final boss, we're treated to two VERY poor choices that come in the form of two battles. The master villain is a scientist and supposedly intelligent; yet when he changes into his attack form, it looks terrible and is void of any real tactical consideration. His intelligence also disappears and he dons the guise of a hentai monster, peering through the split legs of a bound heroine and ogling her breasts, the better to give the hero ample opportunities to thwart him.

The second battle involves a distraught ally. Despite the superb animation thus far, the fight is poorly animated: filled with still shots and three-frame motions. It tries to feel epic, but it has no place in the storyline. After the two extremely disappointing bouts, the story resumes and ends beautifully. Normally, I'd take the great with the awful. But this story was so admirable that the forced inclusion of those garbage scenes really derailed it pretty hard.

All in all, watch it before you buy. IT DESERVES A WATCH. This would have received four stars if not for those ridiculous fights in the end. They stole the mood and narrative (momentarily). The story does return to deliver a harsh realization that grounds the viewers and leaves them with a menacing concept. If only those fights had been avoided.

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seems to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1380153600,6,3585,4.887973640856672
8548562,4,B00A92MFQQ,"1) The DVD: 3/5
a) This product is a DVD-r, but frankly the video and audio quality are the same as those of a regular DVD release (at least to my eyes and ears). It looks and sounds fantastic. The packaging is also very good, and at the same level of any regular DVD release (as it should be given the price that this is selling for).
b) The sound is English 5.1. Unlike what the product description says, it has no Japanese audio, and no subtitles. This is very disappointing. I prefer to watch anime in Japanese since the voice acting is generally so superior to the english dub (plus it allows me to practice my japanese). How difficult would it have been to leave the original audio as an option and add, at least, subtitles for the hearing impaired? By doing that you now catch three diffferent demographics: (1) People that prefer to watch anime in English
(2) People that prefer to watch anime in Japanese (3) The hearing impaired. Bad move. I do not think that I will support these DVD-r releases in the future if they do not include the original japanese audio.
2) The series: 5/5
a) Beautiful, dark, and moving. This is seinen at its best. I had not seen something like this since Texhnolyze.
3) Total score: 4/4",1355788800,18,1223,4.44
