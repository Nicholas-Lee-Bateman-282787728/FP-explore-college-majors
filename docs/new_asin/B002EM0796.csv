8368042,5,B002EM0796,"This documentary is just amazing.  Please take the time and fully immerse yourself in Woody's journey through life.  You will be amazed.  Do not be angry at him for abandoning his children.  Suicide would have normally been the only path for him but he found a way out and I commend him for that.  He has so much love for everyone.  His vegetarian lifestyle is a huge part of who he is and why he was able to live such a long and passionate life, so full of positive energy.",1390348800,,474,4.211111111111111
