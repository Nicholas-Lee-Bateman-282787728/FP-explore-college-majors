I would buy it again with English  subtitles just to enjoy it  more. It also has sharp plot twists and turns that kept my eyes glued to the screen. The film  works because the viewer doesn't know until the last moments how the It will end. But when the film ends, that ending is  just right. The film's makers deliver the ending  so quickly, silently,  subtly and skillfully,  you have to  watch carefully because if you blink, you just might miss that ending.
The DVD cover shows several festival prizes and nominations for the film. It deserves all the prizes and nominations. I did find this film with English subtitles but the image quality is so bad, I am glad I bough the DVD.",1494892800,,853,4.516339869281046
8262026,4,B0016APX4Q,"At first glance, Lars is an unprincipled slacker who subsists on a part-time job at a swimming pool and by mugging the clients of the prostitute who lives upstairs. (She's in on the scheme and lets him know when a customer is leaving.) One day he sees someone he had never hoped to see again, the man who molested him when he was a child. Not only that; the molester appears to be ""grooming"" another boy. Lars goes to the police, but they tell him that they can't arrest anyone who just appears to be looking for victims. This brush-off prompts Lars and friends to become vigilantes, hunting down suspected child molesters.

The most interesting part of this film is the characterizations. We can see why Lars is damaged. We can see how an evil man can appear harmless and mild-mannered and how he justifies himself. We can see the kind of young boys who are vulnerable to the attention of what seems like a father figure and why they don't want to believe the worst.

The final scene, which occurs after Lars and company are driving away from a confrontation with the pedophile, stayed with me for a long time.",1493251200,,1111,4.522388059701493
