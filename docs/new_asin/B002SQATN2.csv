3982051,4,B002SQATN2,"The moves are good but the instruction moves pretty fast for a beginner. IF you have some basic hip/hop moves down, this video may add some flare but if your a beginner, be prepared to hit the rewind button a lot.",1357776000,4,213,4.219512195121951
3982052,1,B002SQATN2,"This is the worst ""learn to hip hop"" dvd. I bought it for my 6 year old. It is so ""old school"" like the 90's maybe. They don't teach you little moves they teach you a whole routien. NOT worth it at all.",1356739200,,202,3.7209302325581395
3982053,2,B002SQATN2,My 11 year old did not like it. She was okay with the parts Shane Sparks was in but did not like to simple way they break down the steps. Will try to get her to watch completer DVD.,1356566400,,181,3.6666666666666665
3982054,5,B002SQATN2,This item comes packaged with two disks inside which makes it easy to share with a friend!

3982055,5,B002SQATN2,"I was happy to find two chock-full of instruction DVDs in this one low-cost purchase.  I recommend it for all ages, but especially pre-teens.

3982056,1,B002SQATN2,I purchased this dvd for my son because he loves to dance and I wanted to surprise him.  Shane Sparks is amazing but the little girl that teaches this is not a great dancer by any standards.  The music was terrible if you would even call it music.  The dance moves were geared to only girls.  Overall terrible. I wish I didn't waste my money on this.,1332028800,,350,4.17910447761194
3982057,3,B002SQATN2,"It's not what I expected. Suitable for early teenage eventhough the dance look nice. I only like the part featuring Shane Sparks, which was very short time.",1272844800,4,156,4.814814814814815
3982058,5,B002SQATN2,"Have had a few, but this wasn't the typical junk wannabee DVD.  Shane is a pro for sure and the moves are all explained.  Didn't mind that there were 2 DVDs in the package either!",1265241600,7,179,4.085714285714285

8379471,5,B002SQATN2,"I bought this for my daughter. She hasn't mastered all the moves yet, but is definitely having fun learning them. The price was great and we'll worth it to get my daughter up and moving.",1472688000,,186,4.3428571428571425
8379472,1,B002SQATN2,Unfortunately this DVDs did not meet my expectations. It wasn't at all what I expected. I bought the DVDs wanting choreography by Shane Sparks but I don't recall watching any of his choreography. Just a bunch of kids. Disappointed.,1471305600,,231,4.948717948717949

8379477,2,B002SQATN2,Could not hear anything coming from the boys mouth.  The girl was a little easier to understand.  This product is not worth the money.,1394496000,,134,4.541666666666667
