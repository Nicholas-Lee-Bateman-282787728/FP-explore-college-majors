8308478,3,B001HB1JZG,Great movie!!! Terrible DVD because it was from a print that was smuggled out of Iran because it was banned a few weeks after opening. So sad.  I got to see this at a film festival and it was a huge hit!  It is funny and very moving. Really loved it. I really hope this can be released in a good DVD with legible subtitles and clear visuals.  Not sure it will ever be possible. Bummer.,1481414400,,385,4.0394736842105265
8308479,3,B001HB1JZG,"I love this movie--one of my favorites ever--but it deserves a remastered DVD with readable subtitles.  If you speak Farsi, you're fine, but I nearly went blind with the white subtitles superimposed over the white clerical dress of the main character.",1467417600,,251,5.121951219512195
8308480,3,B001HB1JZG,"DVD Review: Nothing but the movie. The video transfer is good but not perfect. The subtitles are written like as if for deaf people and audio, Chinese and English is good.

Movie Review: It's bloody and plot is descent but I couldn't get into this one. I can't stand socialist friendly movies (except maybe Iron Monkey). So thus, ends my review.

Conclusion: 4 for the DVD and 2 1/2 stars for The Lizard.",1429056000,,404,4.52054794520548
8308481,3,B001HB1JZG,"Why Celestial Pictures (via Image) chose to illustrate the packaging for this DVD of ""The Lizard"" (directed by Ho Meng-Hua) with the HEAVY of the film instead of the true star, Yueh Hua, is more misleading than Well Go USA's build-up of Fu Sheng for ""Brave Archer and His Mate""! Egad!...Then, if one is watching this with subtitles, watch out: with Image's retooled type and layout, MORE than once, Lo Lieh's WHITE suit hinders reading of the WHITE subtitles! Next time, go yellow, guys (the subtitles, not the suit)....Finally, anyone watching this with impressionable types (children or otherwise) will want to go past the ""adult"" scene 2:37 in (lasting a minute): rememember, this may be ""unrated"", BUT....Quibbles aside, a decent Shaw take on a Zorro-esque hero who assumes the characteristics of a gecko (The inspiration for Kuo Chui's role in ""The Five Venoms""? Watch it, and judge for yourself.); the formula plot that comes with this story will leave some rolling their eyes, however. The ending could've been edited for time (with the same outcome), too, but that's my opinion. Overall, any movie with ""teen favorite Connie Chen Pao-chu"" (sorry, Miley) can't be ALL bad! Recommended for Lo Lieh completists as well as those who enjoy the work of the underrated Yueh Hua....All the best, Brother Fang.",1253664000,3,1309,5.0368663594470044
