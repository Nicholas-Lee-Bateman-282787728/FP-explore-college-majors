8347020,5,B001W79MCC,"This is for all 6 Parts/Volumes. Excellent! It involves another world/dimension and magical power. It has a lot of heart, real character development, and twists and turns to figure out what's really going on, and who the ""bad"" guys really are. Lots of action, romance (it's not too mushy), and blood-works. The ending, well, you'll just have to watch! So get all 6 before the ice cream cone melts! (I couldn't get all in the same format for a good price, so if you mix and match DVD and Blu-Ray, make sure you're getting all the episodes without getting an extra disc like I did.)",1405296000,,580,4.533333333333333
8347021,5,B001W79MCC,This girl can kick butt.  Everyone likes to see a girl who can knock out a bad guy in three rounds.  This is one princess you don't want to mess around with.  You would rather want to be her ally than foe.  A young high school boy ready to take on his enemies.  This is definitely a classic worth fighting to get your hands on.  For years the dvd was expensive until now it is affordable.  Great fans of anime love this film.. You can tell if a person is a true anime fan when you tell them the name of this series.,1394409600,,515,3.941747572815534
8347022,4,B001W79MCC,This is another good anime in Part 1 the anime begins. We get an understanding about the plot. Kuro has her reasons to kill her brother. Also there is a weird system that is  in the series.,1374969600,,189,4.108108108108108
8347023,5,B001W79MCC,"This series, for those who haven't seen it before, is, like the Korean manga-type series it's based on, a mind-blowing experience, and one which has yet to fail capturing the minds of those to whom I have exposed it. At once a reality-bending series, as well as a heart-rending soap, and a kick-ass actioner, this series throws you into the private hell of a small group of people: Kuro, a humanoid Tera Guardian from The Pure Place- a floating Laputa-like island where the balance of the lives of earthlings is kept; Keita, a young loner who shies away from other people, since some who know him end up dead; Punipuni, Kuro's Doberman Pinscher pup, who provides tension/comic relief, and a sounding board for the audience; Akane, a jaw-dropping beauty, and childhood friend of Keita, who suffers for the boy she loves. They form the core of the action. But I invite you to check out the series, and its precedent comic, Black God. A captivating experience for those with a love of ethereal tales of mystical significance, character assassination, and bad chicks with hard fighting moves!",1290384000,6,1088,4.854838709677419
