7823436,5,6302276349,One of my favorite Sesame Street videos as a child.  Loved giving it to my cousin about three Christmases ago.,1436227200,,110,4.5
7823437,5,6302276349,"The Sesame Street gang does a wonderful job of making the hospital less scary for little kids.  My son relied on it when he was hospitalized for a line infection which was a complication of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.  There was a little girl in the bed next to his who had no family at the hospital with her, and she screamed uncontrollably.  My son sent his video over to her and had the staff put it on.  Within moments she watched, settled down, and began to deal with her stay at the hospital.  Sesame Street we need more videos like this, please.",1329350400,,549,4.3431372549019605
7823438,5,6302276349,"This is a must have for parents and grandparents to have, to calm fears of a young child ( 8 and under ) that has to go in to the hospital. We have been watching this all week getting our 5 year old grandson ready for heart surgery. It has been a blessing  to our family. The only thing that they could have done better is to get this on a DVD.",1301097600,,344,3.7777777777777777
7823439,5,6302276349,I bought this video for my 5 year old grandaughter.  She loves it!!  She always took it out from her library so I thought she should have it for her own.  I gave it to her for graduating from pre-kindergarten.  She was so excited when she received it.  We had to watch it right away....,1181433600,,286,4.127272727272727
7823440,5,6302276349,"As dad of a child who was first diagnosed with a form of leukemia at 23 months, and then a second form at 3 yrs, I came to know this video while staying with her in the hospital.  Now 5 yrs old, in remission for both leukemias, and about to go off treatment altogether, she still must spend one day in hospital a month for chemotherapy and an IV-IG immune system boost.  This video is the first thing she asks for when she gets to the hospital.  In fact, her regular nurse usually has it waiting in the room when she checks in.
Sesame Street's ""Visit to the Hospital"" does an excellent job acquainting young children with the routines of the hospital, and of dispelling their fears of standard procedures, doctors and nurses, and hospital stays, in general.  It tells its story with humor, music and compasion.  Invariably, I enjoy watching it too; at least the first time through each stay.",1028332800,9,891,4.509316770186335
7823441,5,6302276349,"This is my daughter's all time favorite video.  It presents a realistic view of what happens in the hospital without frightening impressionable three year olds.  The main song, ""You Have to be Patient to be a  Patient"" is a good one to have in your parental bag of tricks.",961372800,13,272,4.510204081632653
