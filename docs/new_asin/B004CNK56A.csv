8423320,1,B004CNK56A,Though the DVD cover shows four episodes I can only play two. One is limited. Not sure what I expected as there are 39 episodes in the series. 10 of these I can get from the Internet Archive for free. Not at all happy with this purchase.,1513987200,,237,4.0638297872340425
8423321,4,B004CNK56A,I like Willard Waterman ( who also played the grocer in Dennis the Menace) better than Harold Perry who was the original Gildersleeve. Sit-coms like this bring back memories of the 1950's when people used common sense.,1411948800,,218,4.918918918918919
