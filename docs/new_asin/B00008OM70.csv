1857585,5,B00008OM70,"Alfred Hitchcock's directorial brilliance is undeniable, especially in these five taut thrillers. Full of classic great actors like Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck, ""Wrong Men & Notorious Women"" gives a glimpse not only into how good Hitchcock was, but how wide his cinematic range was.
""The 39 Steps"" is the cryptic phrase that Richard Hannay (Robert Donay) gets, along with a map and a lot of people on his trail. A woman has been murdered in his apartment, and now he's on the run from police and spies alike. He ends up handcuffed together with another woman (Madeleine Carroll), on the lam, in a dangerous game of cat and mouse.
""The Lady Vanishes"" on a train, when elderly Mrs. Froy (Dame May Whitty) mysteriously vanishes. Iris (Margaret Lockwood) and music student Gilbert (Michael Redgrave) must band together to unravel what happened, even though they have a back history of driving each other nuts. They must learn who Mrs. Froy was, why nobody wants to be involved -- and what happened to the military secrets she was hiding.
""Spellbound"" opens with the cool, professional Dr. Constance Peterson (Ingrid Bergman) as the new head of a psychiatric hospital arrives. She's immediately attracted to Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck), but his increasingly odd behavior leads her to think that he isn't who he says he is. She learns that he's an amnesiac, who is somehow linked to the real Dr. Edwardes. Taking the man under her wing, she leads him on a desperate search for the memory -- and sanity.
""Rebecca"" still haunts the vast manor of Manderly. When a timid young woman (Joan Fontaine)  suddenly marries the moody, handsome Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), she finds herself in over her head. His late first wife -- beautiful, vibrant and mysterious -- still lingers in the minds of those who knew her, especially the icy housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. When she learns the truth about what Rebecca was really like, and how she died, it might tear her away from Maxim forever.
""Notorious"" again stars Ingrid Bergman, here as Alicia, a young woman seeking to prove her patriotism after her dad turns out to be a spy. She's sent by agent Devlin (Cary Grant) into the thick of the Nazis, even to the point of marrying Alex (Claude Rains). Problem is, she's fallen for Devlin, but obeys him anyhow. Except that when Alex catches on to her plans, he plans to kill her...
Hitchcock had a rare talent for making romantic and/or spy movies, without making anything in them seem silly. While three of the movies are spy-romance films, where two people fall for one another while embroiled in dangerous international schemes, it also includes two very different stories. One is an exploration of psychoanalysis and the human mind (and a romance), and the other is simply the unravelling of an unsupernatural haunting (and a romance too). These two aren't just different; they also show the range of what Hitchcock could do.
The quality and the kind of writing varies from movie to movie (some are subtle and sophisticated, some are almost slapstick in places), since they came from different parts of his career. The acting is fantastic in almost every movie; at times some supporting characters can be slightly flat, but the leads are perfectly chosen.
These are some of Hitchcock's best movies (although viewers should also check out stuff like ""Rear Window""). Dark, funny, romantic, complicated and always suspenseful, these are well worth it. Amazing.",1071273600,8,3487,4.940374787052811
1857586,5,B00008OM70,"I already own each of the five films individually in this box set.  I am a huge fan of cinema, and Mr. Hitchcock is probably my favorite director.  This collection of his earlier works is excellent!  Each film is, simply put, flat out brilliant.  The set includes Rebecca (2 disc), The 39 Steps, Notorious, The Lady Vanishes, and Spellbound.  The extra features on these movies are also outstanding (especially on the Rebecca 2 disc set).  There's no need to go into the plots because they are above on this page.  I had to pay top dollar for each of these dvds, but luckily, for some who do not own them yet, they are avalible in this handsome box at a reduced price.  So save your pennies if that's what it takes to get this collection.  It's worth it!  Thanks for reading.",1051574400,31,775,4.432624113475177

These are ""suspenseful"" if you're not very intelligent; if you don't possess the latter blessing, then these awful agenda-driven pieces drag on for painful hours as you wait to find out how all women are incompetent bimbos who can't wait to sleep with MI6 or Mossad agents.

7986267,4,B00008OM70,"This is a wonderful collection. The booklets are good. My only critique is the type of commentary Criterion chose. I tried to listen to Marian Keane's commentary for both Notorious and Spellbound but gave up. She clearly is knowledgeable but her commentary runs to themes and postmodern discussion that is not as interesting to me as practical discussions of the making of the film. For instance, I enjoy hearing about how a scene was shot or how the actors worked on it or what it took to produce the film. Keane's commentary is wonderful in terms of defining threads and recurring images in the film. When she lip syncs Ingrid Bergman in Notorious, I turned it off.",1420934400,,667,4.7094017094017095
7986268,5,B00008OM70,"This is a great collection of Alfred Hitchock films.  The theme is Notorious women and the men they have wronged.  These are all great films .  I purchased the collection because I wanted a Criterion version of my favorite Hitchcock  (and perhaps my favorite overall) film: NOTORIOUS.  I got that and so much more with The 39 steps, Spellbound Rebecca and The Lady Vanishes.

7986271,4,B00008OM70,"Hitch, Cary, Ingrid, Olivier, Whitty, Du Maurier, Fontaine. The list goes on. All these great talents combined to make a great package for Hitch fans. A selection of fabulous noir that is definitive of all things Hitch. The suspense, the shadows and light, the camera angles, the sly humor, his trademark sequences, all here, for one great Hitch film-fest. A mix of his vintage British films, and the great classics of Hollywood.
Here are the ""wrong men"" and ""notorious women"" that make up this great collection.

""The 39 Steps""
One of Hitch's masterpieces! From 1935.. ""The Thirty Nine Steps"" has Hitch's trademark style all through it. An innocent man gets involved with spies and counter spies. He is at the music hall, watching a ""Memory Act""(which is quite a scene in itself),there's a gun shot, panic erupts and everyone runs out. A mysterious woman attaches herself to him and comes home with him. She reveals she is a spy and others are after her. She mentions the mysterious ""Thirty Nine Steps"", and the next morning he finds her dead. He goes on the run for fear he will be implicated in the murder and in order to prove his innocence he must uncover this spy ring on his own. His path is fraught with danger, suspense and of course a beautiful woman. It stars Robert Donat,Madeline Carroll(you know how Hitch loved those beautiful cool blondes!), and Lucie Mannheim(as Annabela the spy).Also look for his trademark staircase scene.

Looking for Hitch: Less than 10 minutes in, you'll spy him. What a litter bug!

""The Lady Vanishes""
Of all Hitch's early British made film's(mostly made during the late 1920's and 1930's), ""The Lady Vanishes"" is by far the most captivating one for me.
A train trip is the setting for this mystery. A woman's traveling companion has disappeared. Where could she be? The train is only so big. She tries desperately to find her friend, but is alone in her quest. No one seems to believe that she even had a companion to start with. All seem to have their own mysterious reasons for denying her any help.
Finally one man is convinced to help, and together they try to solve this possible crime. There are lots of tense sequences to keep you in suspense, and your heart pounding. Hitch mixes up the thrills with his marvelous sense of humor and his wonderful trademark style. Wonderful performances by the likes of Dame Mae Whitty, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave add to the enjoyment of this one.

Looking for Hitch:....You must be patient. Check Victoria Station almost at the end of the film.

""Rebecca""
What do you get when you have a great work of literature by Daphne Du Maurier, combined with the cinematic skill of Director Alfred Hitchcock,combined with the extraordinary acting talents of Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders and Judith Anderson? You get pure perfection on film. Movie heaven!

The story begins in the South of France where a young, introverted woman(Joan Fontaine) meets wealthy widower Maxim de Winter(Olivier) His wife,Rebecca, had recently died in a drowning accident and often he seems to be pensive and far off. They fall in love, marry, and go back to his home, an estate called Manderly. She is overwhelmed by the palacial grandeur, the huge staff of servants but mainly by the very prim but chilling head housekeeper Mrs. Danvers(Judith Andersson). The first Mrs. De Winter still seems to have a presence in the household that Mrs. Danvers keeps alive.
To say anymore will be giving away too much of this hauntingly chilling love story/mystery.

Looking for Hitch: Nice day for a stroll...check the phone booth scene towards the end.

""Spellbound""
Here's a little of this riveting story.....
The beautiful Ingrid Bergman plays the distant psychiatrist Dr. Constance Petersen. She treats a number of troubled patients at the Green Manors Mental Asylum, but her toughest case is yet to come. With Dr. Murchison(Leo G Carroll) being forced into retirement a new chief of staff will be arriving. It is the esteemed Dr Edwards(Gregory Peck)who takes over. It is not long before Edwards and Constance find themselves attracted to one another, and it is not long before Constance figures out that Edwards is not really who he says he is. He displays signs of paranoia and amnesia and it is possible that he murdered the real Dr. Edwards. They are on the run to try to solve the case but as the original theatrical poster says,""Will he Kiss me or Kill me?""(The DVD comes with a mini version of this poster).

You'll be awed Hitch's definitive style of camera angles, shadow and lights, romance and a unique dream sequence designed by Salavdor Dali. Not to mention all the wonderful talent that graces this film. Bergman and Peck make screen magic together, Carroll is a legend and this film shows us why. Also starring is Rhonda Flemming,Michael Chekhov, and Wallace Ford. The music by Miklos Rozsa also adds greatly to the building tension, and romantic scenes in the story.
So don't worry about trying to over anaylze this one....As Hitch himself said ""It's just a movie."" But a GREAT one!

Looking for Hitch: About :40 minutes in, you may see him if you're quick!

""Notorious""
The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, gives us another edge of your seat thriller. He combines, mystery,romance, and the evil's of Nazism in this chilling story. It takes place shortly after WWII. Alicia(Ingrid Bergman) is a woman with a past. Her father has just been convicted of spying. American agent Devlin(Cary Grant), enlists Alicia to infiltrate a Nazi spy ring. After her father's conviction, Alicia can prove her own patriotism by cooperating in this manner. She finds herself right in the thick of things and her own life in danger after she goes as far as to marry Alex(Claude Rains), one of the very powerful, rich and dangerous ring leaders of the group. Alex is on to her and tries to methodically get rid of his beautiful wife. Can the handsome ""Dev"" rescue the woman he has come to love so much before tragedy strikes.?

You'll delight to find Hitch's trademarks all through the film. The camera angles are definitive,the trademark staircase scene, the passion between Grant and Bergman electrifying,Claude Rains is terrifying, and the story a rollercoaster of suspense filled moments. There isn't a more perfect film I can think of.

Looking for Hitch: A little over an hour in you can have a little drink with him.(Not too much though, the Champagne needs to last the night at this party).

Hitch was ""notorious"" for stories where the ""wrong"" guy was accused of the crime. There are others that could fit into this collection. But I truly think there is one glaring omission. Shouldn't ""The Wrong Man"" with Henry Fonda, be included in ""Wrong Men and Notorious Women""? It is a dark wonderful piece of filmmaking, based on a true story of a man who happened to look like the criminal.

One other note: I notice that Amazon is out of stock. The outside sellers seem to be taking advantage of that fact, and have raised the cost sky-high. If this set is the absolute way you want to go, put it in your cart or wish list, and keep an eye out for a reasonably listed price. In the meantime, you may want to surf around and see what it would cost to buy these films separately. A couple of them are on the expensive side, but others are averaging the usual cost of a DVD. One more route, would be to go to you local video store, they may have it, or may even be able to order it for you at the suggested retail price.

Five 5 star films, but missing one to make the package perfect.

7986272,5,B00008OM70,"This impressive DVD box set showcases some of Alfred Hitchcock's earliest work in the 1930s and 40s, where the young director was not only breathing new life into Hollywood, but also displaying his enthusiasm for macabre tales of murder and mystery. By 1935 Hitch already had 19 films under his belt, however for the most part, his earlier work (The 1920s films THE LODGER, THE RING, BLACKMAIL and MURDER in 1930) was more experimentation that art, but THE 39 STEPS was the landmark film that put Hitch on the map. Watching it on TV late one night, I was enthralled at how expertly-crafted this little thriller was, and its great to see this classic on DVD. Boasting powerhouse performances form Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll and some fantastic cinematography, 39 STEPS says: ""I respect you and here's a great movie worthy of your time"". Made when movie studios like RKO, 20th Century Fox and Universal had uncertain futures, this was one of the movies that assured cinema-goers that this was not only worth money, but showcased some fantastic thrills, chills, and wonderful escapism.  THE LADY VANISHES (1938) is not the directors' best film however, with a slow-paced first 20 minutes and the writing isn't as strongly composed as 39 STEPS. Some impressive action at the finale and a strident score almost make up for it's casual style.

Derived from Daphne Du Maurier's excellent novel by Philip MacDonald, REBECCA (1940) is possibly one of the most expertly crafted films ever made in the history of cinema, a rare perfect film that deserves 6 stars for its incredible style, music, and some gripping acting from veteran Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. SPELLBOUND and NOTORIOUS are equal in style and achievement, and the DVD extras are fantastic, including The Art of Film: Vintage Hitchcock, a Janus Films documentary, rare deleted scenes, restored image and sound, and some amazing screen, hair, makeup and costume tests with Vivien Leigh, Anne Baxter, Loretta Young and Joan Fontaine. Commentaries by film scholar Leonard J. Leff, author of Hitchcock and Selznick, Hitchcock on Rebecca, excerpts from his conversations with Francois Truffaut, phone interviews with Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson from 1986 and exclusive behind the scenes footage of the making of these classic masterpieces.
