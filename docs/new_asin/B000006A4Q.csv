Although our little one is still a ways away from learning about addition and subtraction, he gets a lot out of this because of the numbers and counting -- and of course his favorite characters!

I hope they make this into a DVD, but for now, it is such a good video, that it is worth getting a used video tape copy.",1154649600,,580,4.106194690265487
