8745746,5,B019PKH8SC,"Coming from an Irish family, and having friends of Irish descent in my youth whose family believed that ""The Quiet Man"" was equivalent to a documentary film, I found much to enjoy and commiserate with in this film.  Colm Meany's character berating Sean Lackey's for his continuing reliance on referencing all things ""Quiet Man"" is just lovely!  This is  a witty movie that seeks to pull back the curtain on many of the stereotypes among (probably) many of today's Irish-American families whose ancestors ""came over on the boat"" several generations back, and had the Irish mist in their eyes when regaling their tales of the ""Auld Sod"".
 The parents are well-meaning, but fiercely protective of their son, and smother him with ""sound advice"" to make him reach his full potential; as long as he remembers to come home and visit on all holidays (and holy days of obligation).
I enjoyed very much the twist of finding a non-Irish love interest in, of all places, Ireland (by way of Cleveland)!
Is ""The Yank"" a deep, ground breaking story that Daniel -Himself- Day Lewis would contort his body to star in? --No.  Is it yet another sad tale of Catholic vs protestant strife in a war-torn border town near Ulster? NO!  It's a delightful romantic comedy about an average guy looking for a life mate and finds the Fairy stories told by his kith and kin are best left to be told by the hearthside and not taken for truth.  Our man has good and decent friends, a family who loves and supports him, and a dazzling young lady who challenges him and yet accepts him as well.  And she's not even Irish!!  Saints preserve us!
I think that the reviewers who find fault with this movie might do so because their experience during their childhood may not have included watching Barry himself Fitzgerald, Bing God Bless him Crosby and of course John The Duke Wayne on any day that seemed fitting for a ""good Irish movie"" .  I'm sure they might not have had their Ma get out the scratched and well-worn Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem ""Spontaneous Concert album"" LP and sing along to ""Tim Finnegan's Wake"" or ""Port Lairge"" (even though it was in Gaelic? Sing along like you know it anyway!) as a highlight of Saint Patrick's Day festivities while enjoying homemade soda bread (with a pound of butter for each slice).
  Finally, if you've read my review thus far, and have NOT been confused by the ""irish-isms"" added into the text, taught to me through the oral tradition of my mom and Pop and recognized by most Irish-Americans, you will most certainly enjoy this film as much as I do; if not, then Katie bar the door!",1473984000,,2597,4.621739130434783

8745748,4,B019PKH8SC,"As an Italian American from NY I though this story of an Irish American from Cleveland was hysterical. When Tom Murphy goes to Ireland for a friend's wedding his American parents want him to find an Irish wife. It's a comedy  but it does show the way Americans view their ""homelands"", as places that don't really exist anymore. Fred Willard giving Tom a lesson in Irish history is pure genius. Who knew James Joyce wrote Ulysses about Ulysses S. Grant??",1472342400,,453,4.6625

8745750,5,B019PKH8SC,"Hilarious!  Comedic satire with a lot of heart and witty humor.  It makes fun of the over-exploitation that ""Irish Americans"" face every St. Patrick's Day and ""Half Way to St. Patrick's Day.""  The message I got was that if you love Ireland so much, go over and see it with your own eyes.  See the beautiful landscapes, read the amazing literature and see the beautiful people.  It's not THE QUIET MAN, there are no leprechauns, no pots of gold.  It was funny how once the main character ""got it,"" the Irish characters warmed up to him.  It was also neat to see how strong family expectations can be and how tough it is to break them.  Stars Colm Meaney, Kevin Farley, and the great Fred Willard.  Highly recommended if you have any Irish ancestry or just want a laugh.",1466640000,,768,4.467625899280575
8745751,5,B019PKH8SC,"Funny movie about an Irish American guy. Great scene at the Cultural Gardens. People with Irish ancestry will really enjoy the humors! Great shots of Cleveland, Ohio!!",1464998400,,167,5.222222222222222
8745752,2,B019PKH8SC,"Terrible movie. Poor direction, continuity, editing; idiotic plot. Embarrassing. It denigrates the Irish. Fred Willard is not funny anymore.",1463702400,,140,6.421052631578948
