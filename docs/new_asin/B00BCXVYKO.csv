5580145,4,B00BCXVYKO,"Roth is an excellent interview subject. He seems forthcoming and honest and is naturally well-spoken. Commentary by various people who knew him is kind of interesting but too broken up and some of it is over the top, flattery that would make Shakespeare blush. Take some of the hagiography with a grain, well a kilo, of salt and the rest is definitely worthwhile.",1387843200,,363,4.777777777777778
5580146,5,B00BCXVYKO,"In these days of flash in the pan celebrities Roth stands out as an artist who has devoted his life to creating some of te most memorable characters in American fiction cast in language as razor-sharp as anything written in the past hundred years.
  Mr. Roth appears here as urbane, modest, witty, charming, and intense.  I was fortunate enough to meet him at his 80th Birthday gala held in Newark's Art Museum and found him to be extremely courteous.  Any fan of this great author should purchase this as it gives a well-rounded portrait of the man and of the artist.",1381449600,4,568,4.594059405940594
5580147,5,B00BCXVYKO,"This is a very well done documentary. You really are introduced to the man and his books.
It is a wonderful blend of the author and some of his friends talking about his work.",1376006400,3,175,4.176470588235294
5580148,4,B00BCXVYKO,"i was pleasantly surprised about philip roth's candidness and charm. somewhere, i had gotten the idea that he was a driven, cranky old man. he may be either, or both, but in this long and fascinating interview, he comes across as warm and serious artist with a wry sense of humor.
although i read ""goodbye columbus"" and ""portnoy's complaint"" years ago, i was moved to begin reading roth's other books when i read that he was retiring.
so far, i've read ""indignation"" and ""the human stain"", and i've started ""sabbath's theater. i can see why roth has won so many major awards. i don't believe he is through with writing, as he says, and i do believe he will win the nobel prize.",1369699200,4,677,4.512195121951219
8566495,5,B00BCXVYKO,"What a valuable 1 1/2 hours spent with an extremely honest, part performer (as public speaking demands), straightforward, still ambiguous, gifted author. Winner of more literary awards than likely any other writer, he provides a lively live tutorial on the why and how-to of the art form, with much very personal self-disclosure as lagniappe.  I did pause to reorder  Portnoys Complaint midstream, wanting to be reminded of its disruptive entry onto the literary scene of its day. This is an imposing documentary, and although some of his peers add commentary, its mainly a one-on-one with Roth.  Historical, impressive!",1515283200,,620,5.3061224489795915

The DVD was thoughtful, insightful and informative",1483574400,,104,5.5
8566499,5,B00BCXVYKO,"Greatness so subtle, as in the quiet world surrounding this immense writer.  The simplicity of working, moving forward, having something to say...such a gift, not to be ignored.  Roth is and nothing else matters.",1441324800,,212,5.205882352941177

8566502,5,B00BCXVYKO,I LOVE THIS MAN'S WRITING. THE FACT THAT WE WENT TO THE SAME UNIVERSITY MAKES ME PROUD. I LOVE ALL HIS NOVELS AND THIS FILM REALLY WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HUMAN BEING AS WELL AS THE GENIUS. KUDOS,1391385600,,197,4.2105263157894735
8566503,5,B00BCXVYKO,"This is an exceptional movie, and I am glad to have taken the time to watch it in its entirety.  The interview questions are never heard, only the voice of Philip for the majority of the film, which is the way it should be.  A peek into his life at home, a salt-box Colonial in Connecticut, adds to the depth of this work, as does the interspersed interviews with those that know Roth, intimately and as historians.  Most films would, sadly, err on the side of too much time with others--perfectly acceptable if the subject of the film is dead and gone--but with a living subject, as Mr. Roth, the asides from others must be edited in with care; that is done here, with deft and caring.  Perfect balance of author versus others.

As a middle-aged writer myself, yet new to the craft, I enjoy seeing the process of others: how much time was spent on creating a novel, how the germ of an idea became words on a page, how the writer's process and instincts for the craft changed over years (e.g. Mr. Roth's dalliance with shorter works in recent years).  This is all ""unmasked"" in Karel and Manera's film through the words of the author, himself.

I have read an article on Philip Roth, I believe it was in Rolling Stone, not too long ago, after he declared his retirement.  It was a strong article, and it tickled my fancy about Mr. Roth and his writing; it was not as deeply moving to me as Philip Roth: Unmasked.  I attribute that to my hearing the voice--literally, his voice--on film.  Perhaps my comment here, now that I consider it, harkens to Mr. Roth's contention that the day of the novel as a medium has passed, the torch now in the hands of ""the screens"". I agree.

Perhaps Mr Roth refused to answer questions about his personal life, and if so, this, in and of itself, reveals something of the author and could have--should have--been mentioned in the film. Although a detailed biography of Roth's formative and young adult years are provided, including his relationship with his parents and his brother, there is an information void about his personal life thereafter.  His marriage to Claire Bloom, for instance, is never mentioned.  Avoiding sensation is laudable, but to avoid even one single quote from Mr. Roth about his adult relationships, known to influence the work of others (e.g. Bloom's memoir Leaving A Doll House) is imprudent. If he refused to discuss it, one of the narrators could have told us this fact.  Roth has mentioned, in other interviews, his desire for solitude while he works, and, even this, would explain to some degree his current station in life. This film, unfortunately, leaves most all influential adult relationships of Mr. Roth either unasked, or on the cutting room floor.

I appreciated that the film takes us through Philip's works chronologically, which is a great help to those of us discovering it now for the first time, as I am.  It gives me a notion for the periods when he wrote the works, helping me choose those that might be of interest to me.

I am familiar with, and appreciate greatly, the writing of many of authors; seemingly Mr. Roth has escaped my reading radar until 2013.  I will rectify that in 2014. I have never read a complete novel of Mr. Roth--I, honestly, couldn't say whether I would want him to ""Bring back Portnoy"", as one of his fans mentioned in the film (laughs).  But, I will be spending time at Mr. Roth's shelf at my local library after seeing this film to judge that for myself.",1388966400,,3464,4.603252032520325
8566504,5,B00BCXVYKO,Loved watching this film on the life of Philip Roth. Read so many of his books that it added to my understanding of him as an author. Highly recommend to any fan.,1388707200,2,162,4.09375
