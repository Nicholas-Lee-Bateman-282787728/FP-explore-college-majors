5049522,5,B0072A4I2W,I just have to agree with the other reviews written to date.  I have six or seven versions of Giselle and this one rates high on the list of favorites for all the reasons cited by others.  One to add to the library.,1419811200,2,215,3.9767441860465116
5049523,4,B0072A4I2W,"This is a nice clean recording, especially attractive in blu-ray.  I first saw the Bolshoi in 1959 at the old Met in NYC.  Whatever else one may choose to say and despite their troubles over the decades since then, they seem to me consistent in their aim to put on stage a performance that is transcendent for the audience.  In 1959 a sophisticated Manhattan audience was left in a such a state of excitement that no one seemed willing to leave the theatre to encounter the real world outside. Many were  openly weeping, cascades of flowers were thrown on the stage. It may have had something to do with the Cold War, but we also learned that the Russians have a passion for life and love that can sweep an audience into another world.  We applauded continuously for more than forty minutes, Plisetskaya came out for one curtain call after another, obviously moved by the passion of the audience response as we had been moved by the intensity of the drama she and the rest of the company had created onstage. The real world seemed pale for days after.

In time I came to see in Bolshoi performances that appeared on Laser Disc a resemblence to the great films of the silent era.
Ballet is, or once was the telling of a story without the words. Today dance is more an exercise in abstract motion, divorced from narration or any deep emotion.  In that context the Bolshoi, the Russian approach to theatre can seem dated .
However,here's nothing dated in the performance on this disc.  It's a bright, clean 21st century staging, well lit, populated by a bright young cast.

The folks at the Bolshoi have been attentive to what has been happening at the Paris Opera ballet.  Giselle's friends are not so much peasant harvest girls as an expensively dressed chorus line. The same goes for the the attendants in the aristocratic
retinue.  This gives the first act an air of spectacle that may please some more than others.  Svetlana Lunkina has the look
and lightness of motion that make for an appealing GIselle.  Her lover is a more neutral figure.

The second act is again well performed by chorus and principals but with little sense of a haunted forest populated by spirits not friendly to the two men who blunder into  the scene.  Maria  Allash is another young dancer, whose blank expression as Myrtha suggests more a prom queen than an avenging Wili. Vitaly Biktimirov does well as the luckless Hans, who gets jilted in the first act, to then become the sole victim of twenty seven unforgiving females.

 This is not intended to be a negative review of the performance.  The dancing is flawless if not always impassioned.  The two leads seem more to live out their roles and their relationship as the second act unfolds.  Lunkina has a bright future to grow into.  If I have a reservation it would be with the orchestra, which often seems too comfortable with the music.  Blame it on the conductor.  Adolph Adam wrote a small masterpiece in a score which can powerfully underline the tragedy that takes place on the stage.  It's in a class with Bernstein's music for West Side Story, which also doesn't let you off with a smile, a song and a dance.",1386720000,12,3150,4.6104129263913824
5049524,4,B0072A4I2W,"This is the other ballet that I bought to see what Giselle is about and to compare it with the other one that I bought. Again these dancers are excellent---they get paid for being good. In my older dance class, we are there because we want to challenge our bodies.",1369008000,2,264,4.3
5049525,5,B0072A4I2W,"I had seen some clips of Svetlana Lunkina's Giselle. One year ago this DVD was not available in the US. I left a comment on amazon.uk. When this DVD is published with DVD region code 1, I just simply bought it. I love Svetlana Lunkina's Giselle very much. She is a natural and light dancer. She continues Ulanova's tradition to dance as a pure, innocent and light Giselle. She is the best Giselle after Galina Ulanova, Ekaterina Maximova (Bolshoi Ballet). Hope this great tradition can go on forever. In Act II Svetlana Lunkina's technique and performance is almost perfect. She is like a piece of cloud, even lighter than Alina Cojocaru. Her dancing is not to jump high, but only move as air flowing. A Beautiful Giselle!",1364601600,15,722,4.692913385826771
5049526,4,B0072A4I2W,"The Bolshoi Ballet's production of Giselle, with choreography by Yuri Grigorovich after the traditional version, and set and costume designs by Simon Virsaladze, is an almost ideal production of the quintessential ballet. It goes without saying that choreographically and visually speaking, the ballet is absolutely perfect - it is all in the hands of the dancers. Dimitri Gudanov is admirable in this role, but it is Svetlana Lunkina who really shines. Her gestures, emotionality, and attenuated lines produce an ethereal and remarkable effect. I would watch this over and over again just for her, without counting her remarkable partner and the solid corps de ballet. As per usual of 'The Bolshoi Ballet: HD Collection', the video and audio is in very high definition, wonderfully filmed. I believe that this DVD is one of the must-have Giselles in any balletomane's collection.",1344816000,18,880,5.292857142857143
5049527,5,B0072A4I2W,"This latest issue in the series of HD recordings from the Bolshoi Ballet was made in 2011 and brings their version of one of the most staple Romantic period ballets to our screens. In this case the choreography is by Grigorovich who has also created a memorable Spartacus and Nutcracker. The Bolshoi Ballet has always been renowned for their wonderful dancing, both solo and corps de ballet, so it is a pleasure to report that their return to recordings after an absence due to refurbishment has not resulted in any loss of their previous high standards.

The setting is therefore completely traditional as one would expect and the stage backdrop and flats are of the previous high quality that one would also expect of this company. In Act 1 the backdrop is particularly beautifully painted and the chosen autumnal colours are picked up in the very lovely dresses and peasant clothing of the female and male members of the corps de ballet. The aristocratic court is appropriately luxurious and stylish and both the gamekeeper and Albrecht wear totally believable outfits in both acts. Giselle is delicate and waif-like as befits the story. Act 2 is appropriately devoid of light colours other than the traditional shimmering dresses of the Wilis and the mood is generally sombre throughout.

Svetlana Lunkina makes a good Giselle and dances with skill and delicacy. Albrecht (Dmitry Gudanov) dances and acts his part with meaning in Act 1 and provides good support when required in Act 2. The unfortunate gamekeeper, Hans (Vitaly Biktimirov), equally acts and dances his role well and is summarily despatched by a very unforgiving Queen on the Wilis (Maria Allash) in Act 2. The Wilis rather steal the show in their famously renowned `danse des Wilis, which is performed with precision and grace.

The whole production is filmed satisfyingly with an attractive blend of close and panoramic views, all of which benefit from the crispness of HD cameras. The sound is clear and full enabling all the orchestral detail to tell. It is presented in DTS-HD and stereo, my personal preferred option being for the DTS choice.

This is a very good version as one would expect and comes into direct competition with the equally excellent version with the Royal Ballet on Opus Arte. Choice between the two could easily be made on the basis of personal preferences as regards individual artistes or ballet companies. In that regard I personally have a slight preference for Royal Ballet version as I find Alina Cojocaru as Giselle and Marianela Nunez as the Queen of the Wilis to be marginally more attractive as characterisations but there will be many who take the opposite view and prefer the Bolshoi version for similar reasons.

Final choice therefore has to be very much a matter of personal taste with this ballet as otherwise both issues are very evenly matched. For that reason I feel that it is only fair to suggest the same 5 star grade for this performance that I gave to the other. In terms of this review please bear in mind that many purchasers often have strongly held personal preferences for particular artists/ ballet companies which, in these circumstances, must be beyond the scope of this review which can only be a general guide rather than a finite recommendation.

In summary therefore, collectors interested in adding this ballet to their library of discs could choose either this Bolshoi version or the Royal Ballet version and be well satisfied with either as an 'only' choice or as part of a multiple version collection. Both offer grounds for serious consideration without a serious risk of disappointment.

But, there were far too many tight close ups of the dancers.  It was as though the cameramen didn't understand that we weren't there to see facial expressions and make-up.  We were there to see artistry, footwork, choreography and it's overall pattern, plus to soak up the culture and romance of the story being cold.  A couple of close ups would have been OK, but there were too many of them.",1516147200,,551,4.515151515151516

8508785,5,B0072A4I2W,"Some reviewers compare the Giselle danced by Svertlana Lunkina to other ballerinas'.
I personally am only interested in comparing her 2011 outing here with her debut in 1998 when she was barely 18 years old, with the great Nicolai Tsiskardize dancing the role of Albrecht.
Admiteedly, Lunkina is technically perfect here, even more so than when she was in 1998. But she had the added bonus of being young (18) and very delicate looking back then, and the Duke Albrecht of Tsiskaridze was such a perfect portrayal that Dmitry Gudanov here, howwever technically proficient, cannot compare.
The cast in that 1998 performance had Maria Alexandrova as the queen of Willis, and that one too was more convincing, though Maria Allash here is, again, technically perfect.
The joy and pathos of this work was brought out vividly in the 1998 version, available on Youtube, but if you vie for good pictorial quality, this one is it, and the cast is very solid (Gudanov, while may not the best fit for the flirtatious Albrecht, is a tremendously capable dancer). And we are given this rather LATE chance to watch the great portryala of Lunkina, which is the major reason for the purchase, really.
Lunkina is not as famous as her namesake Svetlana Zhakarova overseas, but I really find that she has more soul in her dancing than the great Zhakarova at most points. Her Giselle mad scene is splashingly pulled off, bringing out all the vehemence, the disappointment and pathos of the dying girl. Admiteedly, her later portrayal of this scene in this version has more dramatic effect than her debut's.
The great Act 2 saw less dramatic conviction than the 1998 version, though once again, Lunkina is virtually perfect in each and every single move. Gudanov puts his great technical prowess to good use in this Act, but ultimately, I personally am more convinced by NT's Albrech.
Still, Lunkina remains 'the' Giselle to me, being the most delicate, soulful, light and heart pulling Giselle.",1433376000,2,1973,4.927927927927928
