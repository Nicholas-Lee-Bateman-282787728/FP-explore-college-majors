8152133,5,B000JM44YC,"We bought this DVD after my 3 1/2 year old saw a live show performed by Magic Al.  I cannot tell you how much she loves this DVD.  It's not just a magic show, but also a stand-up comedy routine geared toward kids.  The story line revolves around Magic Al, who takes over his ailing Grandpa Lew's magic store.  Initially, he knows nothing about magic, but through the help of his wonderful assistant, Yikes, the rabbit (the rabbit from the magic hat....), Al learns to do some tricks!!!

When my daughter watches this video, even if I'm down the hall, I can hear her chuckling the entire time.  While she had no previous interest in magic, she still adores this video. The point is that it's not just for magic lovers only.

I cannot recommend this video highly enough!",1170979200,,768,4.482014388489208

8152135,5,B000JM44YC,I rarely write reviews but my kids( ages 5 and 9) got this DVD as a gift and they love it so much that I had to take a minute and write about it. The show is really entertaining for multiple ages. As a mom I really appreciate that both kids ask for it. I have to admit that I really like watching it too. The show is funny. Laugh out loud funny. I am hoping that this becomes a series. I would buy them all.,1163721600,,407,3.744186046511628

I was in a n audience of a billion little children who were having the time of their lives with Magic Al and Yikes the Rabbit.  The show was a lot of fun and even as an adult I laughed, a lot.  Al is terrific at captivating childrens attention and keeping them hooked.  When it went on sale, I bought a couple of the DVD's and gave them to a friend with two kids and to my nieces as well.  I got calls from both parents telling me that their kids were spellbound watching the DVD and kept asking for it to be replayed over and over. So,I would say, if you have kids, like magic and like to laugh, then this DVD is definitely for you.  If you don't like having fun at all, stay away.",1161734400,,751,3.9403973509933774

I had to come see what it was all about and I wound up laughing out loud, too!  The magic is really good and really funny.  Magic Al is the best!  Yikes had us all laughing and singing along with the songs!  You've GOT to get this DVD!  You won't regret it!",1161561600,,373,3.8289473684210527
8152138,5,B000JM44YC,"This dvd is so great.  My kids ask for it over and over, and I enjoy it too.  Magic Al is funny and Yikes the Rabitt is the next Elmo.  The magic is cool, but the story and songs are fabulous.  Definitely get one for yourself and get two more for friends and family.  Better than any Disney or Nickelodeon DVD out there.",1161475200,,320,4.015873015873016
