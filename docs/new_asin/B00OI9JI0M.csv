6751694,5,B00OI9JI0M,I have watched all 3 seasons twice and the movie twice. Now for round 3! My favorite show ever!,1488412800,,95,4.052631578947368
6751695,4,B00OI9JI0M,Wrong. There was a 4th filmed for the Internet from Warner. Did release it on DVR format. Poor quality. Redo season 4 on pressed high quality disc.,1485302400,,147,4.481481481481482
6751696,5,B00OI9JI0M,"I just purchased and gobble watched the complete Veronica Mars on DVD. The complete set is made up of three seasons for a total of 64 hourish episodes, plus a decent crowd funded movie that is set ten years further on.
I never saw it when the series was first aired but I have got to tell you I swallowed it all down in a four day binge and I still want more.
The setting of the series is a town called Neptune which I assume to be located somewhere near San Diego and Coronado. The detective film noir voice over says it all: Neptune is a town with no middle class  you were either rich, or you worked for them; and part of Veronicas motivation is also clear from her voice over You want to know how I lost my virginity? Well so do I. Great characters. Terrific dialogue. Good plots that are clearly character driven.
An excellent and thoroughly engaging teenage film noir detective series.
Very highly recommended.",1484265600,,916,4.3882352941176475
6751697,5,B00OI9JI0M,"This is a must! One of the best TV shows of all time. Veronica Mars is smart, witty, deeply loyal but also has some dark secrets of her own. She's a strong female character who does everything she can to help the people in her lives. The show also acknowledges the real race and class tensions of a city in California.",1480982400,,318,4.229508196721311
6751698,5,B00OI9JI0M,I LOVED this series and so did my mom and dad. Since we didn't watch the episodes when they first aired they were all out of order. We always wondered who caused the bus crash because we saw all the episodes before and after the crash but never the right one. About a month before my dad passed away he and I were watching the show and finally saw who caused the crash. Fast forward 3 years and my mom was still wondering and wouldn't let me tell her. I got her this for her birthday and she was finally able to find out! This was a great show and I'm glad it brought us together as a family as well as kept us on our toes. Great buy because it comes with the DVD that finally gives you the missing ending that we all wanted!,1474848000,2,725,3.9726027397260273

6751700,5,B00OI9JI0M,"The Veronica Mars TV show and movie focus on the growth of a high school age detective in the first season to an accomplished young woman in the movie drawn back to being a detective. It has a mix of humor along with the serious nature of many of the cases. Her friends help her with different things the are outside her wide skill set. Her father is a former police chief turned private detective who provides her a lot of wise advice. In the end though, the continuing story is how Veronica gest justice for the wronged - evil is always paid back.",1454457600,,549,4.288461538461538

6751703,5,B00OI9JI0M,I enjoyed this series very much. I wish they had continued and took Jessica Morris into the FBI or what ever her next thing to do would be. But that didn't happen. So will have to be happy with what we got and hope they'll make more movies.,1432857600,,240,4.020833333333333
8683727,4,B00OI9JI0M,"A couple of the disks were out of their slot when they arrived and had gotten scratched during transit. I work retail, so I know sometimes this happens and I have seen worse disks. However, I also know that some scratches don't hamper the playability of the disk. I put them in my player and they still play just fine. So, no big deal.",1526083200,,335,4.25
