8764374,2,B01H0W5RO4,"I'd like to give 2 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option allowed by Amazon.  For the price it should include an English dub.  With the subtitled only a fairer price would be between 1/2 to 3/4 off.",1527724800,,195,4.105263157894737
8764375,4,B01H0W5RO4,"My review is primarily about the Blu-Ray and not the show itself (which I enjoyed).

The good: Visually, this series is gorgeous. The transfer is beautiful and sharp. Despite there being a lot of soft gradients and dark palettes, it's rare to see banding or artifacts. The subtitles have been programmed and positioned very well. I'll add a disclaimer that I'm relatively new to watching Blu-Ray, so I may still be in the honeymoon phase comparing it to DVDs I own, but I'm very happy with the visuals.

The bad: I prefer to watch most anime in Japanese with subtitles, so this didn't bother me, but if you don't like subtitles, you're out of luck - there is no English (or any other language) dub. A *FAR* worse problem, however, is that the only audio track is 2.0 stereo! It's extremely disappointing that there's no 5.1 or other surround track, especially for a series that's so heavy on battle scenes and fast moving objects.

The current price ($38 in May 2018) is a little high for only getting twelve episodes and a single stereo audio track, but I liked the series enough to go ahead and purchase it. Extras are a sparse (clean/no-title versions of the opening and five closing titles), but sufficient. I'm not sure what more I would have wanted to see.",1525737600,2,1262,4.625
8764376,1,B01H0W5RO4,That's why I bought it the fact that it said on the title that it was dubbed in English made me think okay great you know I'm getting a dubbed Blu-ray copy of this really great show small promise I get it and the only thing it has is English subtitles there is no duck to this I am extremely disappointed that I spent almost 45 bucks to get this 3 DVD collection and the only reason I bought it was because I thought it was dubbed and it's not dubbed,1520640000,2,450,3.956043956043956
8764377,5,B01H0W5RO4,Seen this on Netflix maybe 1 to 2 years ago. Iv been looking to get my hands on the full tv series. Or what I can get my hands on. Been pretty hard till I found this Collection. Ill add more when I get it in the mail tomorrow.,1506902400,,226,3.63265306122449
8764378,5,B01H0W5RO4,Discotek is a very small company that releases very obscure and classic anime and live action.  Unfortunately  they do not have the money for a dub.  I rather there be a lack of a dub than a bad one.  The show itself is pretty good however.  They also released kousogiga if your interested.,1506038400,,290,4.39622641509434
8764379,5,B01H0W5RO4,"The artwork,voice actor and story was very good! Be nice if they did a 2nd season. So they can finish up the story.",1496880000,,115,4.043478260869565
8764380,5,B01H0W5RO4,"This was a nice set but even though it came with 2 sets of disks,..one blue ray and one dvd i thought the price was a little high. You simply cannot find this anime anywhere without spending a small fortune and this was one of the best prices i found so far.",1494979200,,258,3.980769230769231
