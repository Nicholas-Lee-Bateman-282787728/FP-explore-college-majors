8377182,5,B002PNU1WW,"When Netflix removed Hidden Palms from their ""My List"" (Instant Queue) I finally had to break down and buy the DVD set.  Luckily my DVD player is multi-region, so no issues playing it in the USA...  No option for English subtitles, only Dutch subtitles are available.  If you live in or love Palm Springs, California this is an interesting mystery series; too bad they cut it short with only eight episodes, but I felt that the writers at least were able to give a bit of closure to the story/mystery while leaving the door open to continue it in the future (which never happened).",1427587200,3,581,4.5673076923076925
