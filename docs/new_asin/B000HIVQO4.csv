8139990,5,B000HIVQO4,"For those unfamiliar, the Insp. Lynley Mysteries are a british mystery drama.  Not to be prudish but these and other british mysteries put NCIS and CSI to shame, admittedly the US shows are not trying to emulate this genre.

In this series we have Lynley, the 8th Earl of Asherton (so he is at times prudish and entitled) and he is matched up w/the working class Barbara Havers.  They have great chemistry and underlying tensions (in the first 4 seasons - the script seems to shy off from that in the 5th and 6th seasons).

I'm not a review spoiler, so I won't go into great detail.  They mysteries are set equally, about half in the british countryside (my favs) and the rest in bigger cities, mainly London.  The series has the 3 most important aspects of good television - superb acting, great writing/script/plot twists, and high production values.  If you enjoy Midsomer Murders, this is right up your alley.

Also, the set does not have subtitles (which I need for some british shows), however if your tv has closed captioning, turn it on and the DVD will pick it up and it works GREAT, unlike how it lags behind on live TV.  Highly recommended - I would suggest buying the complete series vs. one at a time.",1260316800,,1214,4.532110091743119
8139991,5,B000HIVQO4,"As a fan of mysteries in general and Masterpiece in particular, I find this series to be of the same caliber as other Masterpiece entries.  The plots are well developed and the stories are solid. My only objection, is why Lynley is so besotted with the whiney Helen. She seems to always be brooding over something and Linley always seems to be taking the brunt of her mood swings. Ok, she had a miscarriage, but is that his fault? Why did she go to her sister's instead of grieving with her husband?
Other than that, the series is enjoyable.  In my view, Nathanial Parker is the definative Lynley. He presents the right combination of class and determination.",1229904000,3,659,4.6239316239316235
