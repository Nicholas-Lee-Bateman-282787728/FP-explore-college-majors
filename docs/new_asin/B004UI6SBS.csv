8441551,5,B004UI6SBS,"This is a fabulous presentation.  Eli really makes understanding of self-realization and awakening, clear, simple and direct.  He uses examples from his own life which helps facilitate an even deeper understanding. Beautiful flavors of Buddhism are incorporated into this teaching but it is clear that the essential transmission is free of all religions. This would be great for anyone along any type of spiritual path.  I am truly amazed at how simple the essential nature of truth is to understand.  Thank you for making something I thought I would never grasp, not only graspable but experiential too!",1224201600,,604,5.195876288659794
