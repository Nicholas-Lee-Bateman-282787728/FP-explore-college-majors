7328866,2,B0116FPJDA,"A brother and sister duo (Catherine and Henry) who are in an incest sexual relationship lure in females the male meets online and the sister makes sure he kills them. The male/brother wears the skirt in the relationship and kills all the women despite his inner desire to have sex with them and marry them. The sister always antagonizes him and stomps out his confidence and tells him he will never have the confidence to have sex with them. They wear silly old school children's outfits to terrify the victims and do some children's routine beforr they kill them. The movie is greatly flawed in that they don't really explain how the brother and sister duo became so screwed up and in the incest relationship. The brother had several flashbacks throughout the movie, trying to unlock his memory of why he became afraid to have sex with women eho aren't his sister. The flashbacks are frequent, boring, vague, and take up very much of this movie. The reason so many other reviewers are praising the actress who plays the sister is because compared to the brother she is a beast. The man who played Henry is so un-threatening its terrible. Between his nancy boy look and forced scaryness you can tell he's forcing it and he's about as frightening as a fly. They needed a stronger male actor. They also need to explain why the duo became that way. The victim actresses were horrendous and I believe they were actually reading cue cards during. I gave two stars for the sister (Kari Wuhrer) and mad props for a then 48 yr old woman in real life looking about 22 in the film when she makeuped and doll faced in the kid outfit.",1467072000,,1622,4.558219178082192

7328870,1,B0116FPJDA,Don't bother! It has pretty terrible acting and the plot has holes in it. It's not very scary not is it a psychological thriller.,1464134400,,129,4.416666666666667
7328871,3,B0116FPJDA,Wasn't the best or worst I've seen in a while. Nothing special though,1451952000,,69,4.384615384615385

7328873,4,B0116FPJDA,"My review is mostly technical, since the film itself is not bad--though it does tend to drag a bit.

The DVD menu interface is outright horrible. There is no ""play"" option, on the main menu so if you press select on your remote instead of play, you are forced to watch the bonus material. Also, no chapter menu. There is nothing beyond the main menu.

The DVD compression is not the best I have seen. For a movie that was filmed in 5K, there is a lot of noise and pixelation. I was very disappointed with the transfer. It's a shame a Blu Ray wasn't available because the presentation could have been infinitely better.

I have seen worse, but this DVD is not worth $20. For die-hard Gordon fans only.",1443657600,2,700,4.369230769230769
7328874,2,B0116FPJDA,"SECRETS OF A PSYCHOPATH is a very crazy movie, all by itself! It centers around""Henry"" and ""Catherine"" a brother and sister duo that are BOTH as crazy as loons. They do everything together. They live together, they have sex with each other and they kill together!
This is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It was not a horror movie; it was almost comedic, it was so ridiculous.
Please, save your time and your money on this one. It's NOT worth the 90 minutes you'll never get back. It's hard to believe that a filmmaker would even bother to make a ""movie"" this bad and so implausible from start to finish.",1442534400,2,614,4.442477876106195
8723682,3,B0116FPJDA,I will watch about anything with Kari Wuhrer.  This was not her best work.,1531699200,,74,4.285714285714286
8723683,1,B0116FPJDA,"Dull shot on video schlock about a psycho brother and sister pair who lure unsuspecting victims to their house that the brother finds on internet dating sites.  This is supposedly written and directed by vet Bert I. Gordon (Attack of the Puppet People; Food of the Gods) who is 95 years old according to the IMDB.  I can't say anything nice about this one beyond the fact that it's competently made, for whatever that's worth.  It's also not even mildly suspenseful or interesting.  The brother and sister aren't particularly smart or careful and in real life would likely be caught very quickly.  In the movie, you have to endure 91 very long minutes of their antics.  Avoid unless for some reason you happen to be a fan of the director.",1490745600,,738,4.638461538461539
8723684,2,B0116FPJDA,"Secrets of a Psychopath was not so secret.  Kari Wuhrer was good but the others were bland.  There was no real plot twist, and the ending was boring.  The direction was lame, and the flashbacks of the children (around 5 years old) drowning in a kiddie pool in 6 inches of water was not very realistic.  This is time spent watching this movie that I will never get back.",1481241600,,369,4.304347826086956
8723685,1,B0116FPJDA,Really a pretty goofy movie. Font waste your time.,1478390400,,50,4.666666666666667
8723686,2,B0116FPJDA,The only reason I finished watching this movie was to be amused by the worst acting I have ever seen. The director should never do another film and the writer needs to learn about plot lines.,1477526400,,191,4.333333333333333
8723687,1,B0116FPJDA,Was horrible. A couple of nice looking chicks but very poor acting and storyline,1476748800,,80,4.785714285714286
8723688,3,B0116FPJDA,Pretty good. Kind of like other movies but this one doesn't really explain a few things.,1473033600,,88,4.5625
