8191160,4,B000PGHEQM,"Oddly, although I thought I'd avoided getting the Korean version, I got it anyway. Since most folks need subtitles with Shakespeare anyway, at least the spoken language is English, so just turn on the English subtitles and Bob's your uncle. Navigating the menus can be a bit tricky, and I couldn't figure out how to access the Extras. They're on the DVD but not, apparently, on the Korean menu. ALSO, it came in a CD jewel case, not a DVD case, but that's a minor quibble.

Cleese is amazingly better than I thought he'd be, and if you follow British TV (through BBC or Acorn), you'll recognize some good old Brit character actors. Perhaps not the best production ever, but fun nonetheless.

I had to look quite a bit to find this at a reasonable price (it is for my grandkids' school project), but, as the adage goes, ""You pays your money, you takes your chances.""",1470268800,,865,4.538461538461538
8191161,4,B000PGHEQM,"This is the best production I have found, however, it is hard to distinguish between all the characters.  There are many situations of disguising one for another and my students had a hard time following it!",1380844800,,207,4.75
8191162,5,B000PGHEQM,"The sets are tame, the acting great.  Cleese amuses and stings, his timing is superb!  An important part of any library, true to the master author.  Well done.",1370476800,,159,4.607142857142857
8191163,1,B000PGHEQM,"The TAMING OF THE SHREW is supposed to be a comedy, but you would never know it by watching this version.  It is the dullest version of TAMING OF THE SHREW that I've seen.  There is no chemistry between this version's Kate & Petruchio.  The BBC may do a good job on some films, but this is not one of them.  I really dislike the Zefferelli version (starring Liz Taylor & Richard Burton), but if possible, this version is even worse.

I would encourage anyone who likes TAMING OF THE SHREW to get the ACT (American Conservatory Theater) version, starring Marc Singer and Freddie Olster. That is a superb version of the play (in fact, it it the most well-acted and produced version of any Shakespeare play that I've ever seen---and I've seen many), and you can get it on DVD via Amazon.",1312588800,,784,4.454545454545454
8191164,4,B000PGHEQM,"You would expect the BBC to do a great job with The Bard, and you'd be right. Everything about this production falls into place. Sets are spare, but the costuming is gorgeous and the actors present Elizabethan English as though it's all they've ever spoken. Maybe other presentations spend more on props and production, but it's hard to imagine any cast bringing the text to life any better, or doing a better job with the turbulent counter-currents flowing under the words themselves.

The cast includes many well known actors, but one truly distinguished himself: John Cleese in the role of Petruchio. He's a great comedian, for sure, but this dramatic role shows another side of his skills. Somehow, all the bluster and swagger that makes Cleese's humor so outrageous works equally well in utterly serious role. If anything, he carries the role too well. He incarnates that brutality, like a brainwashing flick from the cold war era, in a way I find wholly convincing. I find it repellent, in equal and opposite reaction to the force in me that carries gentle affection for the women in my life. It's ironic that Cleese's mastery of the role is what's taken so much out of this play for me.

I can't think of a better ""Taming of the Shrew."" I recommend it highly to anyone who can keep their distance from it better than I can.
