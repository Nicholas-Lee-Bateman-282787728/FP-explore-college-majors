8497095,3,B006FMM8LG,"Twelve Crowded Hours span the period of time it takes for crime-busting newspaperman Nick Green (Richard Dix) to clear his sweetheart's brother (Allan Lane) from a murder charge. Actually, ex-sweetheart is more accurate. The movie opens with Green sauntering into the Busby's Dancing College where his estranged girl Paula Sanders (Lucille Ball) draws pay as a dance instructor. However, his attempt to win her back gifts him with a hurtful slap in the face. See, she's got beef on account of Green's having written some negative stuff about her brother before, never mind that her bro is sort of shady.

How dumb are henchmen who steal from their crime boss? Three such dullards aim to amscray out of town with a satchel crammed with $80,000, loot what's ill-gotten twice over. Burly numbers racketeer George Costain (Cyrus W. Kendall) is the main heavy, and he cuts a sneering, imposing figure. He sure doesn't appreciate his own goons embezzling from him. He arranges to rub them out. Paula's brother Dave, fated to be a trouble magnet, just happened to step in as the perfect fall guy.

Twelve Crowded Hours is an RKO production, a decent B-movie effort. It's very much a movie of its time, having been released in 1939, back in the days when bottled milk was delivered to your doorstep, and reporters are referred to as keyhole peekers, and every motion picture has a scene depicting the activity of a press room in full bustle. Who would've thunk it that the big bad was so civic-minded? There's Costain in full pursuit of the fella what ran off with his satchel. The satchel snatcher leads him to the subway station at which point Costain is confounded by a turnstile for lack of a nickel. Instead of jumping the turnstile, he offers a passerby five dollars for a nickel. The passerby says no, and Costain allows the satchel snatcher to get away.

This movie is a gabfest. Much of the plot concerns Green, held captive by Big Boss Costain and his gunsels, desperately playing a stalling game, seeing as how it's curtains for him the moment he spills the location of the purloined satchel. B-movie king Richard Dix is capable in his intrepid newspaperman role. Poor Lucille Ball still was still years away from her big break. TWELVE CROWDED HOURS falls in that infuriating period of years in which Ball was working hard as an ingenue but not making much headway. Here, she doesn't get to do much but look pretty. She doesn't even snag a whole lot of lines. But she does save the day, so that's something.

Maybe the most intriguing character for me is the contract killer who, when not on the clock, is this affable family man. I would've liked for the movie to explore more scenes for his character, but no. His role is complicit in the movie's having to produce two spectacular vehicular collisions, since his method of bumping victims off is savagely plowing his truck into their automobiles. Just goes to show, the film crackles when it's showcasing its action beats. However, during those more sedate moments, the scenes fall flat, and the absence of snappy dialogue sinks the whole thing. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",1499644800,,3120,4.761552680221811
