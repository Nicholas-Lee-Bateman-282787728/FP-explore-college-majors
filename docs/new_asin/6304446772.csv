""With me stand 6 million accusers, but they cannot speak"". This was the first trial that had witnesses testify which had such a moving effect on the public. Furthermore, this trial was televised to the world. Unfortunately, Israel did not have TV at the time.  The world became conscious of the impact of the holocaust by hearing this testimony.  Hausner wrote an excellent review of the issues in his book ""Justice in Jerusalem."" Deborah Lipstadt presents a very effective summary of the trial and its significance in her book ""The Eichmann Trial"".  ""The Eichmann Show"" was broadcast last year on BBC and documents the TV producers who broadcast the trial.  I hope this BBC show gets wider distribution.  I would like to see PBS rebroadcast their show.",1455926400,,904,4.901315789473684
8529830,5,6304446772,"The Trial of Adolph Eichmann is a chilling first hand account of the trial of Nazi Germany's architect of ""The Final Solution.""The net result of this tragic era in the middle of the twentieth century was the wholesale destruction of 6 million Jewish lives. In 1960 Adolph Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires, Argentina by an elite group of 5 Mossad agents, thus ending 15 years of worldwide searching to bring this most wanted Nazi to justice.  The Trial is narrated by renowned journalist, David Brinkley. The actual trial footage deftly covers the most poignant aspects of just who and what Eichmann was and did. Perhaps the most significant thing the viewer will take away from this film is that 6 million people died one person at a time. In bringing Eichmann to trial for crimes against the Jewish people, the Israeli court brought witnesses from all over Europe representing all aspects of European Jewry. Your feelings will run the gamut as you bear witness to these horrific accounts from a most personal point of view.  The film also adequately covers Eichmann's defense by Nremberg attorney Robert Servartius. It is most intriguing to listen to Eichmann's limpid explanations of exactly what he did and didn't do, was responsible for and not resposible for. Perhaps what is most chilling is the calculated coldness that pervades his persona. Each and every viewer will understand the significance of this historic footage and see this 'footman of death' for what he was. For those who have seen ""Schindler's List"" there is one particular first person story that will loom heavy.  On June 1,1962 Adolph Eichmann was hanged for crimes against the Jewish people. His last words personified his reflections on his place in history; the dispostion of his remains was  symbolic of Israel's response to that place.",973296000,20,1819,4.993399339933993
