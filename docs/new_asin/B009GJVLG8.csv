The simple story of a young chemist, who has set up in business in a drugstore with his best gal.  He gets mixed up with gangsters who have him mix counterfeit toothpaste, cosmetics and later medicines which they package as the brand name products and strongarm local shopkeepers into stocking.  The chemist is able to pay off his drugstore and marry his girlfriend on his ill gotten gains.  He ineffectually refuses to continue working for the gang but is coerced into returning after a beating and a threat to his young wife.

Next, the gangsters girlfriend, furious over being dumped by her two-timing man, contacts the manufacturer of a bestselling antiseptic that the gang has been counterfeiting.  A lawsuit is filed, and the police get involved.  Scheduled to testify, and under police protection, the star witness is gunned down outside her apartment.  The young chemist, in the car with the hit man, struggles for the gun but is knocked unconscious.

Later, his wifes delivery of their first child goes awry and the medication that can save her is an ineffectual knockoff supplied by the crooked gangsters.  Realizing that the gang is responsible for the death of their child, the chemist goes after the gangster, shooting him in his place of business.  The body falls into a vat of acid.

Although the hoodlums end up on the chain gang breaking rocks, the chemist and his wife are at liberty now to live a normal all American life.

Obviously a precode film, there are a few jokes about drugs, a reference to prophylactics, and the chemist, one can hardly call the spaghetti-spined whinger a hero, not only escaping a custodial sentence for what was really cold blooded murder but ending up with a nice little business and a wife who loves him, either unaware of his complicity in her late medical mishap or improbably forgiving him for it.  Its always interesting to see Bette Davis.  In this she is a youngster, full of pep and impossibly slim.",1431302400,2,1995,4.829411764705882
