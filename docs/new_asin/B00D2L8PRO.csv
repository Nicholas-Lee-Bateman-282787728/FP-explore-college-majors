8588608,5,B00D2L8PRO,"McGuire, Go Home is the inadequate and alternate title of this excellent film regarding the divisions between the Cypriots and British. Dirk Bogarde's intelligence manifests itself in almost every frame. The film is quietly directed by Ralph Thomas in the British movie style of the time, and while a little dynamism would not have been amiss, this is an almost great picture. The DVD is better than just adequate. Would love to see it on Blu Ray. Not yet available.",1389139200,4,466,4.8375
