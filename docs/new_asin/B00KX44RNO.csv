6453349,5,B00KX44RNO,VERY GOOD,1426291200,,9,4.0
6453350,5,B00KX44RNO,This is a very nice set.  Well packaged.  The actual DVD case is a 38 page hardboard book which has slots in the top of the pages for the discs to slide into.  The book has a brief history of each estate with pertinent facts regarding famous residents that lived in the estates.  The episodes show the insides of the homes along with interviews from present owners excluding Hampton Court Palace which is no longer a private home. Definitely worth the price.,1422576000,20,458,4.548780487804878

6453354,5,B00KX44RNO,"Stunning and beautiful but at the same time, it is hard for us Americans to realize how arrogant the British aristocracy was when these estates were built.  Wonderfully produced.",1418169600,,178,5.137931034482759
6453355,5,B00KX44RNO,Great history and the printed pictures in the book are excellant,1416787200,4,64,4.909090909090909
6453356,5,B00KX44RNO,"You get to visit Highclere Castle, Downton Abbey, Hampton Court Palace, Althorp and Chatsworth in five DVDs. Every single structure is full of history, architecture and interior design unmatched to any other. These are truly a grand scale creations of human beings with centuries of pride and tradition. Unbelievable feast for the eye from the manicured gardens to every single interior and exterior detail. Full of vibrant colors and life that only British can offer with centuries of dedication in creation and upkeep of such estates. It will cost more to get each DVD separately, much more. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1412294400,23,614,5.15

6453369,5,B00KX44RNO,Beautifully packaged: DVDs inserted within a lovely book.  This is a fabulous collection of info about some of England's remaining great estates. Must be seen again and again to take it all in!,1455148800,,193,4.848484848484849

6453374,5,B00KX44RNO,Satisfied customer,1439337600,,18,8.5
6453375,4,B00KX44RNO,"Interesting, but not enough about the houses - it's more like a ""gloss over"" with a lot of interviewing, when less talk and more viewing of the rooms would have been better.  After all, this is entitle ""Iconic British Estates"", not ""what the windbags think about...""",1429142400,14,266,4.782608695652174
6453376,5,B00KX44RNO,"Very well done with the right combination of historical detail and stunning video. The accompanying well-written book is a huge bonus. If you are interested in the British landed gentry and the social, political, and aesthetics influences associated with fine manor homes, this suburb collection is for you.",1428883200,7,307,5.416666666666667
8662444,5,B00KX44RNO,"Super, very interesting.
Thank you.",1526515200,,35,6.2
8662445,5,B00KX44RNO,"If you like historic British houses or English history, this is one great set. Its presentation is classy and a little unusual. You get a book that fits in a sturdy slipcase which looks like an oversized DVD case. The book inside has thicker pages, like a thin cardboard. And some of the pages are double-thickness because they have a slot for one of the five DVDs included.

The book includes some extra historical material and photos to whet your appetite for the DVDs. For example, in the Chatsworth section, there's a photo of Kathleen Kennedy on her marriage into the Duke of Devonshire's family. A sad tale, as her husband went off to war and was killed after only a month of marriage.

Though in America, we find the idea of primogeniture cruel and anti-egalitarian, it is only the practice of leaving everything to one heir that made it possible for a big estate to remain intact over hundreds of years.

Each of the discs run about 56 minutes, for almost 5 hours of total viewing.  English subtitles are available on the shows. There are no bonus extras.

You can buy each of these shows separately:
A...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-the-Manor-House/dp/B0077PBPYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of the Manor House</a>. In 1912 there were over 1,500,0000 house servants working in English manor houses. There could be no typical Edwardian manor house life without them. This is the story of how that all changed in a couple generations.
B...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Highclere-Castle/dp/B00AY2DL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Highclere Castle</a>.  This lovely great house is the home of the 8th Earl of Carnarvon. Today it is probably best known as the home of the Granthams in ""Downton Abbey"". An ancestor is best known for financing the discovery of Tutankhamen's Tomb.
C...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Henry-VIII-s-Palace-Hampton-Court/dp/B00C888OFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Henry VIII's Palace: Hampton Court</a>. This is still owned by the crown, but it is one of the Historic Royal Palaces group, so called because no royalty live there anymore. Half of it is Tudor with magnificent timbered ceilings and kitchens of amazing size (I've seen them!). The other half is Stuart, with Italian painted ceilings of near-naked people frolicing in positions no real person could manage.
D...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Althorp-Spencers/dp/B00C888NRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Althorp: Spencers</a>. The Spencers have been at Althorp for a very long time. The most famous, Diana Princess of Wales, is buried at Althorp on an island in the middle of an oval lake. It is serene and beautiful. And tourists cannot break off chunks of her memorial for souvenirs.
E...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Chatsworth/dp/B00C888KGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Chatsworth</a>. This estate is the size of Washington D.C., and it used to be five times larger. You may remember Chatsworth standing in as Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's mansion, in the 2005 film version of ""Pride and Prejudice.""

Lots of great viewing and great history.

8662448,5,B00KX44RNO,"Very interesting info about several estates that I had heard of, but never really had the background, so I didn't know the family members.
Suggestion:  Would it be possible to give an account of some of the British Estates that have NOT survived ??  I think the histories of the families is very interesting from any perspective..",1506038400,,330,4.771929824561403
8662449,5,B00KX44RNO,This is a wonderful set!  I very much enjoyed watching it; it is very well done.  I will definitely watch it again.,1500422400,,115,4.181818181818182
8662450,5,B00KX44RNO,We are enjoying our armchair travels. Will probably watch a few times over the years. At 90 years of age travel has become a burden and any films well done as these will be enjoyed.,1494547200,,181,4.2

Had to send the whole thing back.
I didn't re-order.",1485129600,,84,4.3125
8662452,5,B00KX44RNO,Wonderful - a whole collection of DVDs in a lovely booklet.  And the price was a steal.,1483920000,,87,4.117647058823529
8662453,5,B00KX44RNO,"Beautifully packaged in a hard cover book-like set, it sets the standard if you love meandering through a very different time and place. My favorite is  Highclere Castle (think Downton Abbey). The Carnavons are a gracious couple, I could listen to Lady Carnavon all day (she has also written some wonderful books on Lady Almina and Lady Catherine) The Manor House CD sets this former lifestyle in motion and is a great way to understand the hierarchy of the people who lived in these gorgeous homes and how others toiled so unfairly with long hours, hard work and idiotically low pay. If you loved Lady Dianna, you'll be swept away by her brother's tour and beautiful memorial to his sister at Althorp. Opposite that story, it is almost difficult to watch the story of Hampton Court and Henry the VIII, where life could be very cruel and illustrates what a ruthless man he was. Simply put, this CD set will take you away to an era gone by. It never fails to make me feel like I live in a tiny house after ""visiting"" these 100, 200 and 300 room estates!",1477440000,4,1052,4.507853403141361
