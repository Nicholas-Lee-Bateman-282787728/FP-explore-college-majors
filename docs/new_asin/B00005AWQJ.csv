1419451,1,B00005AWQJ,"In pursuit of factually correct accounts of our western history? Stay away from this poorly executed, and factually dishonest DVD. There is absolutely nothing burned on this disc that is correct or well done! Waste of time and money!!!",1253664000,6,235,5.051282051282051
1419452,3,B00005AWQJ,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse release of this film.
""The Gunfighters"" is a passable western set in Wyoming, but Alberta, Canada fills in quite nicely for the scenery. A Canadian film, which ends making the viewer believe it was a pilot for a series that never materialized. It's fine for the family with mild violence and no profanities.
George Kennedy plays the heavy in this story of three brothers who battle land baron Kennedy. The brothers have enough of waiting for the law (who is under Kennedy's control) to help them and take matters into their own hands. Filled with typical clichs, I'm sure you'll figure out the ending before the movie gets you there; still it's a pleasant diversion especially for the low price.
As with many of Brentwood Home Videos, this one has a cartoon (from Max Fleischer) and there are 8 chapter stops for easy selection. The transfer is excellent (for a budget release), looking like it almost came from a master source - almost. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079136000,6,1192,4.680952380952381
1419453,3,B00005AWQJ,"With the exception of George Kennedy and Art Hindle, you probably won't recognize too many faces in this 1987 telefilm unless you live in Canada, where this Western was produced (the word ""out"" is pronounced ""oat"" north of the border).  There's nothing new here . . . the evil land baron (Kennedy), the good guys who are forced to turn bad, etc., etc., but the production values are reasonably good and some of the Canadian locales in Alberta are spectacular (the setting is supposed to be mainly in Kansas).  Unfortunately, the acting is wildly uneven, though Hindle is easily the best in the cast as the older of the two Everett brothers.  The 95 minute film looks like it was a series pilot.  I don't remember seeing this, so perhaps it was produced exclusively for Canadian television.
There are two interesting people associated with the production.  One of the Executive Producers was Sonny Grosso who was one of the real cops portrayed in ""The French Connection"" (the Roy Scheider character).  The other is Domenic Troiano who composed the music.  Troiano replaced Joe Walsh on guitar, when Walsh left ""The James Gang"" for a solo career in the 70s.
Despite the fact that the film was produced in the late 80s, this DVD looks very ""soft"" reflecting its status as a budget release.  At times, it's hard to tell whether it's the photography or the lack of remastering that's the culprit (or both).  Nevertheless, Brentwood Communications does give you the usual extras of a cartoon, a dictionary of DVD terms, an interactive movie trivia game and 8 chapter stops for this release.",996019200,13,1584,4.81549815498155

1419462,5,B00005AWQJ,"I do not remember ever seeing this western in the last 24 years.  There is just something about it that I just love.  The lead actors: Cole, Dutch and Matt Everett are terriffic.  George Kennedy is a meany.  I bought the DVD.  I watch it almost everyday.  I love the musical score also.  The other actors are very convincing in their roles also.  I can't help it, it is like an addicition.",1321401600,3,389,4.305555555555555
1419463,5,B00005AWQJ,My husband saw this on tv and had to have it. I hunted all over for it before finding it her on Amazon. Should have looked here first and saved myself some time. This is a really good western. Women will even enjoy it. It has a very catchey little tune that you will be singing and if it does come on tv and you hear it you will always know it's The Gunfighters movie thats on. George Kennedy makes a terrific bad guy that you'll just love to hate.  And all the good guys are so handsome you ladies will like it. A most enjoyable movie.,1312761600,,536,4.009345794392523
