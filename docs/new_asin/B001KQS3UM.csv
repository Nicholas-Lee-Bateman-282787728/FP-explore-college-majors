3668502,4,B001KQS3UM,"I have several at home DVD workouts and I like this one from time to time.
The instructor goes quickly so don't be discouraged, just keep at it, or pause it and figure out the move and do it with her again. Overall it is a pretty good total body workout, I wish they spent a little longer on each targeted area, but I still like the DVD.",1275609600,,337,3.9705882352941178
3668503,3,B001KQS3UM,"My favorite instructor from here is Stephanie Vittorino.  She leads only 1-10 minute segment: Ultimate Buns and two workouts of the ""bonus workouts.""  Other than that, the very energetic Cindy Whitmarsh leads a decent 20 minute upper body weight workout-very fast paced,but has lots of compound exercises for time efficiency.  If you are into power moves, heavier weights, and are more advanced see the Marco Reed workout, ""Upper Body Cardio.""  In the ""Buns & Abs Toning"" workout, I skip the abs section because the trainer, Meredith, is not attractive.  She is fully covered in black and does those high school sit-ups progression style!  There are varied sit-ups, but the basic position is to lift up to your bent knees.  There is also straight legged sit-ups ,too. Too bad that Meredith continues those undesirable sit-ups in the bonus workouts, but only for 2 minutes.  All in all, I only frequent Cindy Whitmarsh's workout,FIRM UPPER BODY.",1261785600,11,944,5.084415584415584
3668504,4,B001KQS3UM,"I love most of this DVD. Just wanted to mention that it is not all Cindy Whitmarsh. Cindy gives an excellent 20 minute upper body workout that is combines exercises giving maximum benifit for the time. I love that one-I would call it intermediate and up. Then Stephanie Vitterino gives a great 10 minute buns burner. The ab workout on this DVD is awful!! Some woman in a bulky black jumpsuit gives the worst ab exercises ever. There are some really short bonus exercises, but I never bothered wiht them because they are really short.",1246665600,21,533,4.621052631578947
3668505,5,B001KQS3UM,"I've  been trying several different exercise videos, and i really liked this one.  It breaks the workouts into 20 minute intervals, except for  the abs that is 10 minutes, (which is a great workout).",1236556800,9,199,4.794117647058823
8315886,4,B001KQS3UM,"My favorite segment is Cindy Whitmarsh's Upper Body Toning segment. This used to be called ""Tank Top Arms"" on Exercise TV and I was so happy I found it on DVD. She is great and her workout really works the arms, back and abs. This is my favorite segment on the DVD.",1408233600,,265,4.115384615384615
8315887,3,B001KQS3UM,It's Okay...this item requires a lot of time and energy..I did not expect it to be this difficult. It's a little hard but I'am getting there..,1383868800,,142,4.5
8315888,5,B001KQS3UM,"This work out really challenged me. When i finish it, I am soaked. I would definitely recommend this video for all levels of physical activity.",1380758400,,143,4.76
8315889,4,B001KQS3UM,"I got this DVD because I love the Exercise TV series and the instructors and it seemed like a nice workout for those days you don't have a lot of time.

The first workout I tried was the Firm Upper Body with Cindy Whitmarsh.  This was a decent workout with curls, tricep dips, ab work with a tiny bit of cardio thrown in.  It ran about 20 minutes and I combined it with one of the Ultimate Body Cardio workouts for a good 40 min. total workout.

Next I did Upper Body Cardio with Marco Reed.  This was sort of an interval training workout, he suggests you use 8 to 12 lbs, not me 5 lbs was plenty. Lots of lunges, squats, jumps with the weights.  Not my favorite, I'm a intermediate to advanced level workout person but some of the pulls with jumps (similar to kettlebell type moves) were a bit much for me.  It ran about 19 minutes for me.

The same day I did the Bonus Buns and Bonus Abs.  The buns was the usual squats and lunges (lots of squats and lunges) and a tiny bit of mat work.  About 10 min. and I felt it.  The Abs were about 120 various types of sit ups (no crunches for this instructor full sit ups thank you very much).  She started with progressive where you 4 different types 5 times each, then the same ones 4, 3, 2 1.  Then she moved on to other torture with more different types.  For even more torture she threw in some planks on the elbows with knee touches (I swear there were at least 50 but she said 20 on each side) then full planks with arms extended and knees to the elbows (again I swear there were at least 50 but she insisted it was 20 each side)  About 10 minutes of torture.

After combining the Upper Body Cardio and the bonus buns and abs, there wasn't a part of my body that was sore (maybe my little toe on my left foot).

I haven't done the 15 min. bonus mini workouts but if they follow the other Ultimate Body workouts that I've tried it's little 2 min. workouts with various instructors.

These are not bad strength workouts if you are either out of time or you want to combine them with something else to get a good long workout in.",1370649600,,2075,4.119402985074627
8315890,4,B001KQS3UM,"When I discovered that ExerciseTV went off the air, I was crushed.  Several years ago I lost 40 pounds and kept fit by using the cable feature.  During that time I kept telling myself I ought to be buying the DVDs, but always talked myself out of it (why pay when I got them for free On Demand???).

Since that time I lost my focus and several years later I am diligently trying to get back on track.  I was so happy to find I could purchase these DVDs through Amazon.  I'd been looking for my favorite Cindy Whitmarsh arms workout, but was not able to find it.  On ExTV it was called ""Tank Top Arms"" so I kept passing this DVD up for other choices.

I finally purchased it to add to my collection and was happily surprised to discover that while on this DVD its simply called ""Firm Upper Body,"" it is in fact ""Tank Top Arms.""  Yay.  This workout is a great, quick routine that makes this ""re-beginner"" sore enough to feel as though I've done something positive in conjunction with my healthy goals.

The rest of the segments are great, too, except the abs routine (which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5).  It's too monotonous and uninspiring for me to bother with (I use Cindy's ""Incredible Abs"" from the ExTV ""Quick and Incredible Abs"" DVD instead).

I would say this DVD is for a beginner just about to transition to intermediate workout level, but you can bump up the intensity on the arms portions easily enough by increasing the weights.",1363737600,3,1451,4.373134328358209
8315891,5,B001KQS3UM,"I love Cindy Whitmarsh's workouts because she explains what each move does for your body and never scolds you or tells you to ""Suck it up"". She also includes helpful tips (like keeping your head up when you bend down so you don't get a headache!). I'd always wanted toned upper arms and shoulders, and this DVD helped me achieve them. There are other workouts on this DVD as well, but I like the Upper Body workout the best.",1361923200,2,424,4.379746835443038
8315892,2,B001KQS3UM,"I thought that this video would be on par with the others from Cindy Whitmarsh.  Turns out that she only does one segment, and the other segments are very substandard.  The exercises are boring, the instructors are uninspiring, and the filming is amateur.  I can't recommend this video at all.",1351036800,3,293,4.82
8315893,2,B001KQS3UM,"i always have enjoyed exercisetv work-outs, and this set is included. unfortunately, the cd is scratched and skips at least once during each individual work-out.",1326067200,,161,5.48
8315894,5,B001KQS3UM,Really lovvvvee these combination workout.  Brillant the best.  The 20min workout by Mark really get you sweating your but off just great mix of cardo and weight training minute of each for 20 min total....  then following Cindy Whitemarch love her too and the other instructions are all great!  Lots of 20 and 10 minute workout on one DVD.  So depends on your schedule and the time you have it has it all...  I am going to purchase the other Exercise TV dvd too.,1293148800,,463,4.4523809523809526
8315895,5,B001KQS3UM,I like this because I have options as to which one I want to do.  There is a choice of 4-5 so I like that.  The Upper Body cardio is more for a man I would say but instead of the push ups I stay on my hands and move around.  Its a good workout!,1279756800,,244,3.4
