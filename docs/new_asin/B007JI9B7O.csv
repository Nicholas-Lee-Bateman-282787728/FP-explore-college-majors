He got the basics of plot correct,but he left the movie was trach Z rated crap. The FX were cartoonish,the Nazis all talked like the beat up robot from The Black Hole. Rent this turd if you must,or ask for mine. I won't miss it. If you see this on the dollar sale its 99.9 cents to much.",1392940800,,422,4.158536585365853
