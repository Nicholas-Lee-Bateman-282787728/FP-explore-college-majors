462043,4,6302453011,"For starters, ""Arrowsmith"" was not an ideal project for director John Ford.  He doesn't seem to be particularly engaged by the material and his usual flair is lacking in this production.  That said, this enterprise is saved by the superb screenplay by Sidney Howard adapted from Sinclair Lewis' novel and an excellent cast.  Lewis' tale of an idealistic physician who compromises his principles and his marriage as he rises through the ranks of his profession is told intelligently and compellingly.  Ronald Colman, though maybe a little old for the role and a wee British for a Midwestern doctor, is dynamic as Arrowsmith.  Helen Hayes does wonders with her role as Arrowsmith's long-suffering wife.  On paper there is little substance to her character but Hayes does the most with what she is given.  Though made in 1931, this film holds up remarkably well because it's central themes are as relevant today as they were then.",1110499200,2,927,4.98051948051948
462044,4,6302453011,"""Arrowsmith,"" the 1931 film directed by John Ford and adapted from Sinclair Lewis' classic novel by screenwriter Sidney Howard, was actor Ronald Colman's favorite film until he made ""A Tale of Two Cities."" Colman stars as Martin Arrowsmith, the idealistic young doctor who seeks a cure for bubonic plaque. Inspired by his mentor Professor Gottlieb (A. E. Anson) to pursue medical research, Arrowsmith gets his medical degree and marries nurse Leora Tozer (Helen Hayes) and ends up being set up by her family as a country doctor in South Dakota. He proves to be a poor physician, but he does come up with a serum to cure cattle of a disease. After returning to New York to work with Dr. Gottlieb, Arrowsmith is inspired by the Swedish doctor Gustav Sondelius (Richard Bennett) to go to the West Indies where the bubonic plague is raving the islands. Gottlieb wants Arrowsmith to give the test serum to only half the patients, to do a sound clinical study. But after Leora succumbs to the disease, Arrowsmith gets drunk and ends up giving the serum to all of the patients. Although the British authorities credit him with ending the epidemic, Arrowsmith knows he has betrayed science to be a humanitarian.
Certainly an interesting film, which Sinclair Lewis considered an excellent cinematic representation of what he had tried to do in his novel, even with the major cuts and changes mandated by Howard's screenplay. The author had refused the Pulitzer Prize for his 1925 novel, so if he is happy with the adaptation I am not going to accuse him of merely being polite. The choice of John Ford to direct the film does not end up being significant in any noticeable way and I would think most viewers would be surprised to see his name on this one. Colman's performance is excellent in a part that plays to his strengths, and since his character dominates the movie he gets the main credit for making it work. His scenes with Hayes, who won the Oscar that year for ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet,"" are quite effective as if young Myrna Loy as Joyce Lanyon, who briefly catches Arrowsmith's eye. The story is certainly atypical in that it speaks for the important of scientific research over the healing arts that Hollywood usually associates with great doctors. ""Arrowsmith"" received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Writing (Adapted), Cinematography and Art Direction, and the score is by Alfred Newman.",1049068800,14,2410,4.866180048661801
462045,3,6302453011,"This highly touted 1931 film, based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Sinclair Lewis (who refused to accept the Pulitzer), was named one of the ten best films of the year by none other than The New York Times. It also received a number of Academy award nominations, including that of Best Picture. Directed by the now legendary John Ford, I had high expectations of the film that were, unfortunately, not met.
This is a film that has not aged that well. While Ronald Colman, in the role of the central character, Martin Arrowsmith, is excellent, the film does not live up to its reputation. This film was shot in the early years of talkies, and it still carried some of the earmarks of a silent film. Exaggerated posturing, odd segues, and somewhat disjointed scenes mark it as such. It also suffers from a somewhat uneven screenplay.
The story revolves around a young, idealistic man who wishes to become a research doctor, rather than a practicing ohysician. He runs into a nurse, Leora Tozer (Helen Hayes), whom he falls in love with almost immediately and marries right away. One wonders what the urbane Arrowsmith sees in this somewhat pedestrian woman, as there appears to be no chemistry between them.
After they marry, he gives up his dream to be a medical researcher and, instead, moves to South Dakota, where his wife, Leora, is from and sets up a country practice. While working as a local physician, he interests himself in the plight of the local bovine, as they have fallen prey to disease. He comes up with a serum that saves the day, and he publishes his findings.
His research comes to the attention of the well respected McGurk Institute in New York City, where his medical school mentor, Dr. Gottlieb, is established. They make him an offer he cannot refuse, and he and the devoted Leora relocate to the big apple. There, he has a break through, having created a bacteria destroying serum. When Bubonic plague besets the then British West Indies, he goes down there to conduct a clinical trial with his serum. Leora also goes with him, against his better judgment.
While in the British West Indies, the authorities refuse to let him conduct clinical trials. They want him to give the serum to everyone. Arrowsmith is not prepared to do that as a medical researcher. He is then approached by a black doctor, a graduate of Howard medical school, who is working with the native population in one of the outer islands. He is willing to have Dr. Arrowsmith conduct his clinical trials on the native population. So, Arrowsmith goes off, leaving Leora behind on the main island, where he believes she will be safe.
A tragic set of circumstances causes the devoted Leora to contract the plague, while Arrowsmith is away. By the time he returns to her, it is too late. Going off the deep end, he stops his clinical trials and does the humanitarian thing, indiscriminately giving the serum to all. When he returns home, he is hailed as a hero, but he knows that, as a man of science, he has failed in his objective.
The most interesting segments of the movie are those scenes that take place on the islands. They are beautifully shot, moody and atmospheric. It was interesting to see the inclusion of the black doctor, at a time when Hollywood films generally only included blacks as eye rolling, singing, dancing Stepin Fetchit characters.
Ronald Colman is his usual velvet voiced and handsome self, competent and sympathetic in his role as the idealistic man of science. Helen Hayes I found to be lackluster and annoying in the role of Leora. When she contracted the Bubonic plague, I could not help but think that Arrowsmith would now be free of this stupid and insipid albatross. Myrna Loy has a bit, and I mean bit, part in this film, as a lovely looking woman, who is definitely interested in Arrowsmith.
Notwithstanding its shortcomings, fans of Ronald Colman, as well as those who love vintage films, will enjoy this one.",1023494400,6,3945,4.727140783744558

462047,4,6302453011,"A prestigious Goldwyn production, ARROWSMITH offers a wonderful performance from Helen Hayes as Leora; Colman's performance is good, yet he's rather wooden in comparison. Directed by John Ford (!) it was actually considered a very modern picture back in 1931 because of the criticism the film makes of the ""selfless"" dedicated research scientist. An interesting, complex comment on racism is also part of the experiments which Arrowsmith practices: When the white inhabitants, to whom the serum is first  offered, refuse the conditions of it's administration, Brooks, a black doctor offers his people to test it. Arrowsmith accepts and hellish montage of fire, shadows, rats and fleeing black bodies follows!",958435200,2,708,5.495412844036697
462127,3,6302453011,"""Arrowsmith"" is a 1931 film based on the 1925 Sinclair Lewis Pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name. Coming from Lewis, the novel was an indictment of the medical profession.

Handsome Ronald Coleman (1891-1958) plays Dr. Arrowsmith. Coleman was a silent film actor whose rich, melodious voice propelled him to stardom when talkies came out. He was Oscar nominated for two films in one year - 1929 (""Bulldog Drummond"" and Condemned""), and again in 1942 (""Random Harvest"") and finally won in 1947 (""A Double Life""), for which he also won the Golden Globe.

FWIW - Although Coleman was a great actor, at 30 years of age he was getting a little too old to be playing a medical student. That's probably why Ford shot the initial scenes from the back without showing Coleman's face, however, his voice is clearly the voice of a middle aged man and not a young medical student.

Helen Hayes (1900-93) plays a nurse whom Arrowsmith weds. Hayes, the ""First Lady of American Theatre"", is one of only 12 people to win the quadruple crown - an Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony. In her case, she was the first woman to achieve this status and she ran up a total of 7 - 2 Oscars (""Airport"", ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet""), 2 Tonys (""Happy Birthday"", ""Joan of Lorraine""), 1 Special Tony Award, and 1 each for an Emmy (""Harriet Beecher Stowe"") and a Grammy. Her life was more devoted to the stage, but she managed 50+ performances on TV and 20+ films. My favorite Hayes performance was from ""Anastasia"" (1956).

Myrna Loy (1905-93) plays a New Yorker whom Arrowsmith assists (and becomes his second wife in the book, but not in the film). Loy started in silent films in the mid 20s, appearing as an uncredited slave girl in ""Ben Hur"" (1925) and then appeared in more than 50 silent films before transitioning to sound. Her persona as a comedienne slowly emerged in films like ""The Prizefighter and the Lady"" (1933) that was directed by Woody Van Dyke, who would help transform Myrna Loy into Nora Charles, the other half of ""The Thin Man"" series (1934 - 47) for which she is best known.

Clarence Brooks (1896-1969) has the distinction of being the first Black person to appear in films as a highly educated person. He made about a dozen more films through 1951 but ultimately ended up playing a butler, a porter, and a half naked savage.

Look for Ward Bond in an uncredited appearance at the start of the film as a cop. Bond was a close friend of Ford and appeared in dozens of his films. Look real closely and you'll also see everyone's favorite grandma Beulah Bondi, Ford favorite John Qualen, and cowboy star Ray Hatton.

John Ford (1894-1973) was a struggling director in the early 30s, and his 76th film was the first that distinguished him and hinted that he might have a future.  Ultimately he won 4 Oscars (""The Quiet Man"", ""How Green was my Valley"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""The Infortmer"") and was nominated for ""Stagecoach"". He had 3 DGA nominations and 1 win and 4 wins by the New York Film Critics.

FWIW - Ford's greatest as a director is not apparent in this film, although in retrospect you may detect some clues.

The music from Alfred Newman (1900-70) is impressive. Newman was nominated more than 30 times for an Oscar and won 9 times - ""Camelot"" (1967), ""The King and I"" (1956), ""Love is a Many Splendid Thing"" (1955), ""Call Me Madam"" (1953), ""With a Song in My Heart"" (1952), ""Mother Wore Tights"" (1947), ""The Song of Bernadette"" (1943), ""Tin Pan Alley"" (1940), and ""Alexander's Rag Time Band"" (1938).

1931 was a great year for film. The top grossing films were ""Frankenstein"", ""Cimarron"", ""Mata Hari"", ""City Lights"", and ""Dracula"". The Oscars went to ""Cimarron"" (Picture), ""The Champ"" (Actor), and ""Min and Bill"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year include  ""M"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde"", and ""Monkey Business"".

The NY Times' Mordaunt Hall called the film ""intelligent and forceful"" and ""highly praiseworthy"", and praised the acting and the direction. The film was nominated for Best Picture, Writing, Cinematography, and Art Direction, but didn't win.

The movie is the only ever filmed version of the book, so it's interesting from that POV, but it's really a watered down version of the book without the harsh criticism of the medical profession. And Coleman is just too old for the part. OTOH, it's a chance to see the great Helen Hayes in action and the supporting cast has a plethora of great character actors.",1312848000,,4459,4.722007722007722
462128,4,6302453011,"Arrowsmith may have been made with a misstep or two along the way, but it's not that bad a movie. The acting is convincing and the plot moves along nicely; I wasn't ever bored. The cinematography and choreography work well and the script was well written. In addition, the quality of the print is very good. On the other hand, I agree with people who say that the ending is too abrupt; and Ronald Colman was a bit too old to be playing a young doctor fresh out of medical school during the first half hour or so of this film.

When the film starts we meet Dr. Martin Arrowsmith (Ronald Colman) who falls in a love with a hospital nurse Leora Tozer (Helen Hayes). Pretty soon they are married; and Leora convinces Martin to set up his new medical practice in South Dakota. Martin had been considering dedicating his life to medical scientific research, but he is happy to go with Leora. Their attempt at having children doesn't go very well but they are in love with each other and they manage to move on. Martin also has quite a disagreement with the state veterinarian (David Landau); but I'll leave the rest of that for you to discover.

After a couple of years in South Dakota, Martin gets an offer from his elderly medical school professor and mentor professor Max Gottlieb (A.E. Anson) to accept a good paying research position in Manhattan; and together Martin and Leora move to the big city. After another two more years, Martin makes a huge discovery that a certain chemical mixture can kill ""bugs;"" and from that it isn't long before Martin and his peers strongly suspect that his mixture can potentially cure or at least ward off the bubonic plague epidemic occurring in many places including the West Indies. Martin goes on an expedition to the West Indies--and to his surprise Leora insists on going with him; she can't be away from her man. Another colleague, Gustav Sondelius (Richard Bennett), accompanies Martin on his mission.

But trouble looms. It's not the most humane mission; Gottlieb and others want Martin to only give his serum to half the population in a region of the West Indies; this poses an ethical dilemma for Martin Arrowsmith because it's highly probable that those who do not get the shot of serum will die of bubonic plague.

Of course, many more things happen to Leora, Martin, Gustav, Max Gottlieb and the others--but I'm not about to spoil it for you so I'll leave it at that! However, I will say that you should look for a fine performance by Clarence Brooks as Oliver Marchand, M. D.; this was the first time an African American was depicted in an American sound film as someone with lots of high level education, refinement and a brilliant mind. Myrna Loy has a small part as a woman who attracts Martin while he's helping the locals; and Russell Hopton does a good job of playing Terry, a young chemist at the Manhattan institute where Martin works. Claude King also plays Dr. Tubbs, the director of the research institute.

Unfortunately, the DVD comes without extras--unless you count scene selection and subtitles as extras. I would have liked some commentary but we simply don't get any.

Arrowsmith suffers from a few all too quick plot twists and the ending is definitely too abrupt. However, it's not all THAT bad; and fans of the actors in this film may well want to get this for their DVD collections.",1261872000,,3353,4.645868465430017
462129,3,6302453011,"In ARROWSMITH, director John Ford tries mightily to bring to life the novel by Sinclair Lewis about the eternal struggle between idealism and pragmatism.  In this, Ford fails to bring to life the memorable drama that is on every page of Lewis' novel.  The fault is not Ronald Coleman's as the physician who always places people over profit. Rather it is the herky-jerky script that shifts the setting from one sharply contrasting scene to another with neither believability nor seamless segue. Coleman plays Dr. Martin Arrowsmith right from the start as one who wishes to study medicine so as to become a researcher to find cures for All That Ails Mankind.  Fair enough.  But no sooner does he say that than he is quite willing to become a country doctor in Montana far from any lab. He brings with him his wife (Helen Hayes), a nurse whom he proposes to on the first date. In short order, he finds a cure for a cattle plague before deciding to move to New York to find work as a researcher in a fancy Upper East Side facility.  In the novel, Lewis pictures this facility in the bitterest terms as all that he saw as wrong with modern medicine.  Such doctors, Lewis viewed as mercenary and any results of research had to have an immediate payoff.  In the film, Ford at least got this right as the facility's publicity director had no problem with labeling a prototype of a serum of Arrowsmith's as a universal panacea.

Most of the movie gives snippets of Arrowsmith's life from country doctor to medical researcher to caring physician in plague torn West Indies. The audience sees clearly enough what happens to Arrowsmith but fails to feel an empathy even during moments of tragedy.  When his wife loses her baby, Coleman is strangely detached from the reality of the loss.  When she dies of plague in the West Indies, Coleman shows even less feeling as he can do no more than place her lifeless body on the nearest bed. And then there is the Myrna Loy character as Joyce, a recent widow whom Arrowsmith meets in the West Indies.  In the novel, they marry only to learn that the idealistic Arrowsmith has no place in the glitzy world of Upper East Side doctoring. In the film, director Ford introduces her clearly as a romantic complication, perhaps to test the fidelity of the true blue Arrowsmith.  However, their relation never progresses beyond that of the passing acquaintance. Ultimately, ARROWSMITH is a film that with a tighter script might have emerged as an engaging indictment of the money hungry medical profession. Instead, the indictment fizzles out as what might have been but wasn't.",1242864000,,2601,4.717439293598234
462130,3,6302453011,"I have a MGM video of John Ford-directed ""Arrowsmith"" and the liner notes on the cover read: ""Named one of 1931's Ten-Best Films by The New York Times, Photoplay and Film Daily, the film was also a top box office success."" The film actually got four Oscar nominations--Best Picture, Writing (Adaptation), Cinematography and Interior Decoration--but all these facts may be a little incredible to us now.

Not that the filmed adaptation of Sinclair Lewis's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is terrible or worthless. After all this is a John Ford movie. As I tell you later, it has a few touching moments, but still the film is very disappointing even for those who have not read the original novel. Obviously ""Arrowsmith"" is trying to be something - satire, romance, cautionary tale, or morality tale - but you are not sure what it really wants to be even after the film ends.

Those who have read the book will be dismayed to find the film hurriedly moves on, skipping considerable portions of the first half of the book. Unlike Lewis's novel, or expose, the film doesn't have much to say about the life in a small town in America. There is no Pickerbaugh and his doggerels. The satire is there, but it doesn't bite even by the standard when it was released.

The film quickly moves on to show the life of Dr. Martin Arrowsmith in New York City, working for prestigious McGurk Institute. (Its interior designs are pretty good.) Then, before we know anything about the publicity-minded institute and its unwritten codes, an epidemic breaks out in the Caribbean Islands. Despite its powerful scenes that ensue, the film looks too short and the ending abrupt.

There are some merits, however. Myrna Loy is effective as Mrs. Joyce Lanyon, but her role is not big. Helen Hayes (who was to win Oscar the same year for the role she played in ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet"") is also good as Martin's devoted wife Leora (and one moving scene set in the dark house on a Caribbean island). It must be pointed out that like Sinclair Lewis's original ""Arrowsmith"" the film includes a black character Oliver Marchand (Clarence Brooks), a competent and heroic doctor who supports Martin. He is not a stereotypical black character you might find in most films of the day.

Though not a total failure, ""Arrowsmith"" needs a better script that allows for character development. Or perhaps what it needs most is running time.",1236297600,,2398,4.796610169491525
462131,3,6302453011,"This film was actually nominated for four academy awards - cinematography, art direction, adapted screenplay, and best picture. Viewing it today, there are so many somewhat incomplete storylines and messages present, I am somewhat unclear about the director's goal in all of this. Sinclair Lewis' book, on which the film is based, goes into great detail about the tribulations and triumphs of studying to be a doctor and then practicing medicine back in the 1920's. It is just impossible to convey all that goes on in the novel in one 108 minute film. First of all, although young Dr. Arrowsmith comes across as an admirable protagonist who doesn't lose his idealism through all of his experiences, his character development and motivations are just not fleshed out in the film, and thus he is left an unintended mystery. His passion for medical research definitely shines through in Ronald Coleman's performance, but I had many unanswered questions. The film seems to imply that Arrowsmith is attracted to Myrna Loy's character through one scene in particular in the film. Was this intentional? The two have an affair in the novel, but if it is going to be omitted from the film - and it is - what was that one scene doing there?  Arrowsmith talks a good game about loving his wife, but he seems to constantly overlook her in his passion to find new cures for diseases. Is he actually taking her for granted, or is this just a common attitude from the past in which wives always took a back seat to their husbands' careers?

There is another whole part of the film that is quite troubling to a modern audience. When Arrowsmith is sent to the Caribbean to help fight the plague by testing his new serum, he is instructed to basically do what today is called a double blind study. He is to inject half the patients with his serum and the other half he is to treat conventionally. Thus, it can be determined whether or not the serum will be effective. When Arrowsmith presents his plan of action to the local plague-ridden residents, the shocked citizenry deny his help ""in the name of humanity"". However, a local black doctor, Oliver Marchand, tells Arrowsmith that he knows of how he can accomplish his goal - by experimenting on the black residents of the island of course! To me, this was all too reminiscent of the Tuskegee experiments and had a large Ick Factor to it.

I can't grade this film too severely since I have to take into account its year of production, the fact that dialogue had not become that sophisticated yet since talking pictures had only been universally accepted for about two years, and finally that a complex novel is being squeezed into just over an hour and a half. This film's value today is mainly as an example of one of the better transitional era talkies. Dialogue and acting were much more natural than they had been just a year or two prior to this film, but vast improvements, particularly in dialogue and technology, were just a couple of years away.",1174694400,,2988,4.687619047619048
462132,1,6302453011,"I truly wanted to like this film. The cast. The director. The script. But sadly, it is dreadful. The script is a mess. The direction is hit and miss. And Ronald Colman, in the lead, turns in what must be recognized as one of his worst performances. He is not 'present' in his scenes - save for one, when Arrowsmith's wife has just died and he is drunk. He looks inebriated, with fire in his eyes, and he is actually in the moment. The rest of the film he drones on with his utterly self-conscious voice, leaving poor Helen Hayes acting to a wooden dummy. He simply isn't there.

There is splendid photography in most of the West Indian scenes. Quite stunning and worthy of freeze-framing to appreciate the composition.

Avoid this and go straight to the magnificent DODSWORTH.",1157500800,2,776,4.575539568345324

462134,4,6302453011,"I have become a fan of Sinclair Lewis over the years and it all began when I read ""Arrowsmith"".  I admit that I was initially befuddled by the book until I came to understand the relationship between Medicine and Science; Money and Research.  Into this mix comes a man who knows what he wants to do but is twisted into something else.  In the end, his pursuit of his avocation costs him the one he loves the most.

Many years after I read the book, I got a chance to see the movie.  I was looking forward to the opportunity because it was directed by my favorite master of the trade, John Ford.  Although I noticed some of his usual techniques were missing, I had to acknowledge that Ford did a great job.  I thought the best imagery he created was the fog in the pestilent island home.  As the leading lady was succoming to an illness, we saw the fog creeping into the open doorway and into the darkness therein.  There were other images that I enjoyed but much of the enjoyment was with the acting.  I have come to realize that it is no coincindence that Ronald Colman happens to keep showing up in impressive movies.  Here he is teamed up with a very young Helen Hayes (how did she manage to skip middle-age and transform from a young actress to en elderly one in her career?).  There is a good supporting cast with a few of the Ford stable of supporting character actors.  (Did you catch the unbilled Ward Bond playing a cop in an early scene in the movie?)  The movie, naturally, skips a lot of the book's details and I'm bothered that they changed the location of the heroine's home town from North Dakota to South Dakota.  However, the movie did well to bring out the focal points of the book while finishing in a better dramatic flair.

I found the movie ""Arrowsmith"" to be a strong picture for its' time just as the book was a strong challenge to its' time as well.  There were some aspects that were dated but there were also some aspects that were treated better than Hollwood's usual approach in that era.  For example, the work that the doctors did among the Black islanders failed to conjure up the usual embarrassing scene of the overt bigotries of the time.  In the end, amidst the grief, there is hope.  That is a stock trait of Ford's movies that I was glad to see included.",1140566400,,2292,4.360849056603773
462135,3,6302453011,"With the advent of sound, it seems movie directors forgot what pictures could be. Certain technical problems of the early sound era (positioning of microphones, for example) were a major source of these difficulties, but generally speaking the movies made furing this time period (1929-1934 or so) are incredibly stagey and stiff.

In this picture Ronald Coleman plays Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the idealistic young medical doctor who discovers a serum for plague; Helen Hayes is his devoted wife, who dies from the disease. The script is almost laughably inane, the acting utterly wooden. Coleman, with his highbrow English accent and stiff manner, seems miscast; Hayes at least shows a little bit of life. For some inexplicable reason the movie struck a chord with the public and it was nominated for an Academy Award, though it lost to GRAND HOTEL.

Note and question: For years it's been reported that the movie originally ran 10 minutes longer, with much of the part with Myrna Loy as the ""other woman"" being cut and apparently lost. I notice the running time of the movie given on the DVD is about 10 minutes longer than the time given on older VHS copies. Does this mean the snipped film has been restored??",1133308800,3,1211,4.87378640776699

The picture quality is beautiful, the camera moves very well for being an early talky, and the plot moves as well. There are also some interesting visual/arty shots in the film that impressed me, and the acting was quite good too, although there were a few scenes that had overdramatic elements. But, I don't find this a problem.

Ronald Colman is, as always, charming; the story and role are good for him, and as I said above, the direction was excellent. So many early talkies ARE stagey and static - this one is not.

One scene that I found really cute was the one where he pulls out a little boy's tooth and remarks to the boy that he ""hasn't been making the most of his toothbrushing opportunities"".

Get this movie. It comes highly recommended from me as a fan of both Ronald Colman and old films.",1112313600,16,905,4.5060975609756095

7825649,3,6302453011,"One thing the pre-code Hollywood pictures do very well is they allowed significant brevity in film. Arrowsmith is adapted from the famous Sinclair Lewis novel of the same name. John Ford adapts a 440+ page, well-known, and widely-read novel into a best picture nominee in under 110 minutes. Impressive. The release year of 1931 represents the transition period between sound film novelty acts like The Jazz Singer (1927, Alan Crosland) to serious, well-made, award season contenders like Arrowsmith. Of course, Arrowsmith is not the first great sound film to be nominated for awards. In fact, its difficult to even call it great at all; its watchable, not memorable. Yet here we have a silent film transition star in Ronald Colman transitioning into a talkative character in Arrowsmith, a director in John Ford transitioning from B-westerns and melodramas, and a studio in MGM under Louis B. Mayer who wants to transition MGM from leading studio status to untouchable. Unfortunately for Colman, Ford, and Mayer, their attempts to push Arrowsmith into an unforgettable film failed. Melodramatic, sentimental, and clich seem like harsh labels, but alas, they fit this film. Also, the natives of the Caribbean infected with Bubonic Plague are shown in unflattering portrayals, as are the Swedish characters with their accents amped to the point of unintelligible babel. In the end, Colman never really broke into A-list star status, the film never won any awards, although a few bright spots emerge: (1)  Mayer and Ford went on to achieve legendary greatness; (2) the female stars in Helen Hayes and Myrna Loy became female icons and A-list stars in their own right; and (3) Arrowsmith introduced a market for medical-related drama film. Also, notice the widespread drinking in this film; Prohibition is still in effect in 1931 and its interesting to see some of that pre-code naughtiness come through.",1425686400,,1899,5.185667752442996

This has to be THE WORST adaptation ever of a great book made into a movie, and honestly, no excuses for it being made in 1931. Not that it's in the same vein, or faithful to its original, but one should remember that Frankenstein was made the same year, so the art of making ""talkies"" didn't have to suffer in the hands of a great director, or await new technological developments!

Imagine someone who has seen Dodsworth, one of the greatest, as well as one of the most adult films of all time, and has read both that book and Arrowsmith, then coming across this ridiculous movie. What were they thinking?",1329782400,,728,4.473684210526316

Directed by John Ford

Based on a Sinclair Lewis novel ""Martin Arrowsmith"". A medical researcher is sent to a plague outbreak, where he has to decide priorities for the use of a vaccine.

Colman and Hayes are an attractive pair of leads. Myrna Loy has a much abbreviated role in the film as a New York socialite that Colman meets down in the islands.

Earnest and already quite distinguished looking as young Arrowsmith is Ronald Colman, Helen Hayes suffers nobly as his neglected wife, infected herself through a careless action by her doctor husband.

Near the end of the story, we get a glimpse of the young and seductive Myrna Loy in an underwritten role.  Editing seems to be very obvious from the original ending in the novel.

Nominated Oscar for Best Art Direction (Richard Day), Best Cinematography (Ray June), Best Picture (Samuel Goldwyn), Best Writing, Adaptation (Sidney Howard)
