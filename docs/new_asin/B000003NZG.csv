7903173,5,B000003NZG,"A TRUE CLIFF HANGER. THE ACTORS, ESPECIALLY CLAYTON MOORE AND KAY ALDRIDGE WERE EXCELLENT BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID SEEMED BELIEVABLE. BOTH RODE HORSES AND FOUGHT THE BAD GUYS WITH ZEST AND I SERIOUSLY DOUBT DOUBLES WERE USED. THE LANDSCAPE WAS NOT PAINTED IN LIKE MANY SERIALS. THE STORY KEPT THE INTEREST UP AND RUNNING. i WATCHED IT ON VHS TAPES AND THE PICTURE AND SOUND WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR. I SUPPOSE THE DVD MUST BE AWESOME. I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND BUYING IT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK BACK TO THE 40'S AND 50'S WHEN THESE SERIALS RAN IN MOVIE THEATERS.",1389916800,,542,4.540816326530612
7903174,3,B000003NZG,"A compilation of a ""chapter movie"" that I saw on successive Saturday afternoons growing up in New York in the 40s.  Perhaps, even at that early age, I was fascinated by the idea of an attractive, long-legged heroine and a similarly fascinating villainess.  A cute, if implausible, adventure tale, set in North Africa, which today would seem almost a parody, but I'm enjoying the trip down memory lane which it's affording me at not too high a cost.  One of the ""bad guys"" is an Italian, so identified, possibly because they were part of the Axis, w/ which we were (or were about to be) at war but not the object of pathetic ridicule that Italians became in the war movies that followed.",1188777600,,686,4.560975609756097

7903176,5,B000003NZG,"The original title of this was ""Perils of Nyoka,"" which is more appropriate because it conjures up reminiscences of ""The Perils of Pauline.""  It's the first serial William Witney directed alone.

It's excellent:  Lots of action, terrific cliffhangers, good musical score.  From what I've read, most people seem to prefer it to the original Nyoka serial, ""Jungle Girl,"" but I beg to differ.  I find it just a notch behind ""Jungle Girl,"" mainly because Kay Aldridge (""Haunted Harbor"") doesn't measure up to Frances Gifford, and Lorna Gray is a little over the top in her high priestess role.  Gifford had been on loan to Republic for ""Jungle Girl"" and wasn't available for this one--Aldridge is a capable heroine, but she's no Frances Gifford.  You'll note that they changed Nyoka's surname from Meredith to Gordon (in order to save on royalties to Edgar Rice Burroughs' estate) and the setting is now North Africa instead of the jungle.

This was Clayton Moore's first starring role.  As everyone knows he became famous as the Lone Ranger, a role he carried on even after he left the movies and went around promoting the Lone Ranger's values.  Moore starred in about ten serials, but never as the Lone Ranger.  He died in 1999 at age 85.

Charles Middleton (Ming in ""Flash Gordon"") is exellent as a bad Bedouin, though he's not as dominating as usual because he's not the main villain.  The stunts are done by Dave Sharpe and Tom Steele--Sharpe doubles Clayton Moore in all the fights (quite noticeably because he's not as tall as Moore), and he considered this serial among his best work.  And inside that gorilla suit is Emil Van Horn as ""Satan,"" though he's not even listed in the credits.",1136592000,,1691,4.786206896551724
7903177,5,B000003NZG,"I've never been a huge fan or collector of the old serials. I've only seen two or three in my time and I'm too young to remember them firsthand...so mine is a novices review,but even I know better than to judge one by modern standards. If one were to go into ""Nyoka.."" with a cynical modern day attitude they would be in for a world of disappointment. Don't expect any kind of cultural or historical authenticity, or shakespearean acting...Do expect a whole lot of fun,excitement and some pretty decent stunt work for the time period. Its lots of fun watching the achingly cute Nyoka go from heroine in peril to jumping out of trees and taking out two bad guys on horseback single handedly. The expression on her face when that rope bridge breaks on her is priceless...I had to rewind it 3 or 4 times... again,not shakespeare caliber acting by any stretch..but great silly fun. This kind of stuff was obviously made for 12 year old boys (and there's nothing wrong with that)....but Nyoka will make you long to be 12 years old again anyhow. Enjoy!",1044230400,4,1046,4.598930481283422
7903178,5,B000003NZG,"Who said they didn't use to have feminist role-models in the movies? Kay Aldridge as Nyoka doesn't take any guff of the bad guys, whether male, female, or simian--she just decks 'em and moves on to the next peril. She even, on occasion, saves the hero, who is played by The Lone Ranger himself, Clayton Moore. Add the villainy of the wicked Vultura, Charles Middleton (AKA Ming the Merciless in the Flash Gordon serials), and Satan, the ape (actually the great Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan in an ape suit), and you have a movie packed with the kind of goofy fun serial fans love. As good as it gets.",1020902400,3,591,4.481481481481482
7903179,5,B000003NZG,"Oh lord, how I enjoyed seeing this again.  It's amazing what I remember of it from when I saw it at around age 12.  It has stood up over the years, with all the gimmicks that make these cliffhangers so lovable.  The killer ape is superb...there's a ""ham"" inside that suit, I swear!  He's a natural scene stealer. Then there's the dog, a match for Rin Tin Tin any day!  And the heroine!  The chapter endings, especially when she falls into a fiery pit, and the ""pit and the pendulum"" ending...  This definitely is a gem among cliffhanger serials!",992649600,6,545,4.444444444444445
7903180,5,B000003NZG,"""Perils of Nyoka"" (the original title) gave former models Kay Aldridge and Clayton Moore their first starring roles, in one of the best serials ever made. A viewing of it will reveal sources of many gimmicks  from both the ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" movies.  It even features a female villainess (Lorna Gray, later to be known as  Adrian Booth), a dog who seems smarter than some of the humans, a comic  monkey, and a killer ape. The supporting cast is top-notch, as is the  direction of William Witney. Republic made the best serials and this has to  be near the top.",959904000,11,573,4.568627450980392
