8392330,5,B0039UU3FU,"After watching a few movies staring Gena Rowlands, I'm sorry to say that for the talent she possesses, and the versatility with which she executes her roles, she is very underrated. Her portrayal of Betty Ford, presenting difficult periods in the life of a loving wife and mother, was moving, thought-provoking and informative. There is a thread of being direct and unswerving in her style of acting that often requires her to be physical in many scenes, in which you think she is going to hurt herself. No matter what the character, how low or embarrassing the circumstance, she is still a lady with a sense of self respect that lifts her humanity above the trials at that moment.",1281312000,5,681,4.73109243697479
8392331,5,B0039UU3FU,"GENA ROWLANDS GIVES ANOTHER WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AS BETTY FORD. NOTE: ALL THESE WARNER ARCHIVES DVDS WILL NOT WORK ON SYSTEMS THAT HAVE A RECORDER OF ANY KIND. YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO WATCH THESE GREAT TITLES ON ""PLAY ONLY"" DEVICES. THEY PLAY GREAT ON MY CHEAP DVD PLAYER AND WON'T READ ON MY EXPENSIVE DVD/VHS COMBO.",1276646400,2,319,4.614035087719298
