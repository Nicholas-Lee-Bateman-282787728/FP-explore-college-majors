2562409,5,B000FEY020,"The DVD consists of 3 parts: Nutrition, Exercise, and Circulation. As far as nutrition goes, I did not hear anything I didn't know already, most of the things Dr. Murad was talking about are pretty much common sense. Although I learned more about the nutritional value of cayenne pepper and it's impact on blood circulation.

As for the exercises, they are excellent! There are 10 different exercises shown in the video and one supposed to pick 4 of them and do them regularly, 3 times a week for about 20 minutes. I started doing themn 1-3 times a week for 10 minutes and I can already see how my legs toned up in less than 2 weeks. After the first time doing the exercises I felt the difference. Just make sure you stay plenty hydrated while doing those exercises otherwise tomorrow will bring a lot of muscle pain:)

The DVD definitely worth it but one has to commit to following the advice and doing exercises",1203033600,40,913,4.527272727272727
2562410,5,B000FEY020,"I exercise regularly and very rarely have soreness.  After one go all the way through (only ~20min) I am still hobbling 2 days later.  Sitting is near impossible.  Everyone is making fun of me at work.  This video is well worth the purchase price.  I don't know about getting rid of cellulite yet as tonight is only my second go at it, but I will update later.  I like that there are a lot of extras.  An interview with Dr. Murad, a nutritionist, and another trainer.  Most of the information isn't new, but it is nice to have it hammered home again.  The only criticisms I have in no way affect the rating I give this product for giving me a good workout.  The production is cheap.  During interviews the camera pans in and out awkwardly.  It would have been nice to have camera #1 and #2.  Cuing is poor with the instructor, she doesn't indicate which leg to work with, miscounted reps on a few exercises, and doesn't indicate a change when stretching, so that when you aren't looking at the tele you can fall behind. It would be great if there were two exercise segments.  One that goes slowly and explains how to do the moves, and one that goes all the way through without pause.  A lot of time is spent explaining the exercises and correcting the beginner demonstrator.  This isn't necessarily bad as it gives you some time to breathe, but as things get easier I can see getting impatient.  Overall, don't listen to my complaints.  Just get this video so that I don't have to be the only one hobbling around.",1201651200,28,1513,4.420289855072464

2562421,2,B000FEY020,"This product comes with a long boring introduction that you really need to listen to in order to make the process work. It is not quite as advertised stating that the key exercises will target the areas and reduce cellulite. It is actually the tried and true method of healthy eating and exercise along with massage. There is a lot of controversy over the massage approach to cellulite reduction and many exercise trainers feel this is just a marketing ploy to sell expensive unnecessary products.
That all being said, if you follow the healthy eating plan and if you faithfully do the exercises you will see a reduction in cellulite but that is not exclusive to this product. Any healthy eating and targeted exercise plan will reduce your cellulite.
Also, the product claims a visable difference in 4 weeks. I didn't notice a difference in 4 weeks or at least one that mattered to me. Perhaps if you take pictures  you may see some subtle changes but not a dramatic meaningful difference.
My final point is that for the first 2 weeks my legs butt and hips were sore but after that I grew accustomed to the exercises and they weren't difficult for me. In fact I memorized them and could do them while watching TV (this was somewhat a good thing). The problem is that the claim is in just 20 minutes a day you could get results and as your body strengthens you will need to increase the frequency, intensity or duration to continue to see results.
Of course we are all looking for that miracle quick fix for our problem areas and although we know this isn't reality we still purchase things like this. It will help, but takes dedication and commitment - like anything. If you are willing to put in the work and time you will see results but that is the case with any exercise.",1347321600,4,1775,4.529595015576324
2562422,1,B000FEY020,"The nutrition info is boring to watch and not very informative. The exercises are very basic and really are primarily meant for beginners. If you are an intermediate to an advanced exerciser, I would not recommend this video.",1345248000,3,225,4.947368421052632
2562423,5,B000FEY020,"Love this DVD!!!! Only 20 minutes long and the workouts are really useful. The first week I started, my legs were still sore after 3 days, which really means I worked those muscles well.

2562425,2,B000FEY020,"The exercises in the video are good--they are definitely effective and you will be sore after your first attempt. However, the DVD is terrible. You can't skip directly to the exercises without having to fast forward through the other common sense junk. There aren't many tips on how to do the excersizes correctly, which is essential in doing an effective workout with out hurting yourself. (I must have been doing something wrong because I strained my knees.) Also, Kim is annoying--her form of encouragment to keep going is a series of ""wow's"" in a very bimbo tone of voice. Obnoxious. Don't pay more than $5.00 for this program, it's not worth anything more than that.",1322265600,7,671,4.843478260869565
2562426,5,B000FEY020,"I bought this DVD a few months ago after I decided to go on a battle against cellulite...again. I have tried everything over the years and although I'm petite and in decent shape, the ugly dimples on my thighs and butt have always made me feel unhealthy and self-conscious. I have been doing the routine for over 3 months now and I have definitely noticed a difference! The cellulite appearance has been reduced and my legs are toned, more muscular and stronger. I have to admit though, the exercises still feel hard for me, even after 3 months. Instead of picking 5 and working out for 20 minutes, I do all 10 exercises but I do less repetitions. I can't pick my favorite 5 because I feel like all 10 target different areas. I know the exercises by heart now so I do them in front of the TV and I must say, this DVD really does the trick! I've also started eating healthier and implemented dry brushing morning and night, which definitely helps tone the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite. I highly recommend the DVD and if you stick to it, you'll see results!",1314144000,5,1070,4.436548223350254
2562427,5,B000FEY020,"if i could rate this video higher than 5 stars, i would! this is the single best workout video i've ever seen and the best leg workout i've ever done. i've been through a very painful cheerleading camp, daily step aerobics, 20+ mile cycling jaunts and military training, and nothing even touches this quick little workout. one look at kim, and you can see what you're working for!

i've also always been told you can never get rid of cellulite and have tried and failed enough times to believe it, but this workout does it. hard to believe, i know, and i wouldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it for myself. it actually doesn't take long to see results either. i started doing this workout after i had two children 18 months apart and had lost a great deal of tone from not working out for so long. after literally a few weeks, i have more definition in my legs than i've ever had. i really love that you can do it anywhere, quickly and without weights, a gym or a trainer. after a few times, you will have the 10 exercises memorized and don't even need a DVD player at that point.

be warned, this workout is incredibly painful the first time--i had trouble going from sitting to standing and vice versa! and the second day is always worse! it does get easier, though. it seems impossible to do it the 3 times per week that she suggests--i just laughed at that when i first heard it--but it can be done. this is really the only workout i'm doing right now, and i've been doing it 3 times per week for a few months now. that's only after doing it once per week for a while and then twice per week for a while after that.

as the negative review said, the presentation leaves a little to be desired, but she doesn't mess around! she gets right to it without a bunch of talking, which is good when you've done the video a few times and just want to get it over with!

this is an absolutely amazing workout and worth every penny. even after several months of doing the workout, i still get my heart racing, sweat a lot and feel the burn. if you can tough it out, you will invariably be amazed by and satisfied with the results.",1308700800,11,2129,4.262376237623762

2562429,3,B000FEY020,"This is definitely a good workout!  You will feel it, in a good way, if you stick with it and finish every exercise.  The reason I gave it a three star is because of the instructor and DVD setup.  You can't just skip right to the exercises without having to fast forward through an interview.  Additionally, I found the instructor to be highly irritating.  After a few times of watching the entire video, I have found it helpful to put it on mute and just enjoy listening to music while following along by sight.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this video; however, just be prepared to be annoyed!  :)",1296000000,6,610,4.541284403669724

I've been doing them after some breaks and my muscles were very sore.  It's great though, as many other workouts out there barely make you pant or sweat, and produce close to zero results.  This one definitely makes a difference, especially massages with moisturizer, I just wish I had a stronger will to follow it regularly!",1272240000,4,500,4.975903614457831
2562431,5,B000FEY020,"I am a size 2 so fully clothed, I look fine. But, put me in a bathing suit, and I immediately throw on a cover up. I have always been very self conscious about my upper thighs, but was able to maintain them when I was younger by running and even just walking. Due to age (I am now 41) and genetics, they have gotten worse with loss of muscle tone and increased cellulite. Even when I used to run, I never felt that I was getting the toned look I wanted. Although my body type will never allow me to be ripped, I definitely feel and see a difference in my upper thighs and butt. One of my friends said she could see more definition even in my jeans. I feel stronger and I feel like my legs overall look better. This DVD definitely works and targets the areas I needed help with. And, the best part is it doesn't take a lot of time. I work full time and have a family, but I can squeeze in this workout 3 days a week. I will say it was hard at first. I hadn't worked out in awhile and I was a bit sore, but keep doing it and it gets easier. Thank you!",1270598400,19,1049,3.883720930232558
2562432,3,B000FEY020,"I can see how you would definitely see results if you did this frequently, however the video itself is not super exciting.  There is an instructor, one experienced person and one lady who has no experience and they point out the inexperienced lady's mistakes throughout the dvd. There are 10 exercises one right after another totaling 20 minutes that are all good exercises that really target the glutes and lower body, but there is nothing in between so it doesn't really flow.  I will keep it and use it periodically, but not something I would enjoy on a day to day basis.",1264204800,17,574,4.617647058823529

2562434,3,B000FEY020,"The only worthwhile part of this DVD is the exercise routine itself. All other information presented on nutrition, creams and massage, etc. is too basic and vague to truly be useful to anyone. Everything that is discussed by the ""experts"" is common knowledge to most people (i.e. exercise regularly, eat healthy, stretch, moisturize your skin) and no truly detailed practical tips are given. For example, the DVD provides a long list of ingredients that a good lotion might contain, be we are not told if we should find a lotion that contains all of them or just any one of them or if one ingredient works better than another. Also, we are not told when or how to use such lotion. Also, we are told to eat healthy food, but little explanation of what this really means is provided and some of it is even a bit confusion at times (for example, Dr. Murad tells us we should eat meat and soy to increase our intake of protein, but he doesn't mention beans, and it's not clear if this means he considers legumes to be off limit or simply forgot to include them).

The workout, on the other hand, is pretty good and it might be worth buying the DVD just for this. I already knew most of the exercises shown (all but 2 of them), but I had never done them all in a row like this without interruption. Also, the pace was fairly quick, creating much more of a challenge (my heart beat actually got elevated, which never happens to me while doing these kinds of exercises!). I was not terribly sore at the end of it (nor the next day), but while performing the exercises, I did feel I was being challenged. Also, because of the fast pace, I think routine qualifies as both strength training and cardio exercise for me.

It should be noted, that while I did the entire workout (all ten exercises), Kim says we can choose as few as 4 of the ten exercises and do them for 20 minutes. The exercises presented vary considerably in intensity and one can chose those that best fit her level of fitness, which is useful (if I had chosen the easiest 4 exercises I would not have been challenged properly, but there were a few exercises I would have found hard to repeat for multiple sets). Personally, I prefer to do all 10 exercises in a row, but others might find it simpler to only learn how to do a few of them.

All exercises were explained well and were easy to perform, even though I found it hard to pay attention to what Kim was saying while reading the written instructions at the same time (I think it would be good to watch the entire routine once before trying it out). The stretches were pretty basic (except for the very challenging split), but this section of the DVD might still be useful to beginners.

I can see myself using the workout section of the DVD regularly. I doubt this will make my cellulite disappear, but I am sure it will help tone my legs more.",1251158400,8,2859,4.388679245283019
2562435,5,B000FEY020,"As a fitness instructor, I'm always asked about something my clients can do on vacation.  Voilla!  ""Love your legs"" was the hit of the century.  It has been an instant hit with all of my clients and helps them return to my workouts easier when they return.  I felt that the instructor Kim was very knowlegeable and used very intelligent cueing to motivate the participants.  I would have to agree with the majority of the reviewers in that the video was spot on. I was not sure what ""Jen's"" criticism was all about and I found the production quality perfectly fine.

My first go at it, I thought, ""Eh, this'll be easy. Nothing ever gets my legs sore."" Thinking I was too cool for school, I didn't stretch. The workout was difficult... in a GOOD way! After twenty minutes, I was dripping in sweat and my legs... actually felt fatigued for once! My heart rate was up throughout the workout, which is an added bonus to have some cardiovascular benefits. I certainly paid for it the next couple of days. I was incredibly sore. So sore I even had trouble walking up and down the stairs. My students made fun of me at school because I had trouble sitting and bending over. I tried the workout again last night and I stretched before and afterward. Today I have minimal soreness and know that I can really get some results. Heck, I've had results just after two workouts. My advice: STRETCH!!! You're not a superhuman when it comes to this workout!

The other parts about the nutrition and circulation are good bits. Not anything we hadn't heard about before with nutrition, but worth listening to again. The massage and stretching stuff is good stuff to make part of your nightly routine. Before I bought this DVD, I already started dry brushing before my showers and using a firming lotion with a leg scrubber and have seen results, so I know paired with this workout and healthy eating will be awesome!

The best advice Kim says in this is if you have time to take care of your hair and the skin on your face, you have time to take care of your legs. I never thought of it that way but it is really good advice that I'm sticking to!",1242086400,14,1722,4.429022082018927

This is the only cellulite work out DVD which has received five stars out of five from its customers.  I don't understand why other buyers were complaining about this DVD being too 'dizzy' or out of focus.  It was a pleasure watching it and following the exercises.  Sometimes the camera man would change focus from the Kim's full body image in order to show her legs or feet only so you can be able to see how to keep the right posture, where the core of the exercise is and where you should feel it.  Not doing exercises the right way you will only get a small amount of results and Kim wants to make sure that you are doing the right thing.  Even by using a normal person in her DVD, by normal I mean somebody who is not a gym freak and who exercises only once in a blue moon, Kim wants to show that anybody can do these exercises and get results.  I jog every morning for two and a half miles, so one would think my legs are used to exercising.  Well, after trying Kim's exercises on this DVD I have come to the realisation  that jogging plays only a small role in having nicely toned and defined legs.  I would recommend this DVD to anybody.  And it is OK to do as much as you can, lift your leg or do the squats as much as your body and muscles allow you to, as long as you do it the right way, you will notice that in time you will manage to do more of a lift or squat.  Exercising should be pleasurable and if it hurts, stop and relax and try again tomorrow.  I lost 27 pounds through exercising and dieting. When I first started jogging I was out of breath after only 5 blocks. Persistance and commitment helped me realise my goal of two miles and further.

It's about the size of a credit card, so you can even carry it around with you in your wallet or pocket. Very helpful! Anyway, the first part of the video is basically an informative on cellulite and proper nutrition. Good things to know. The second part is a series of exercises ranging from beginner to advanced, with varied stretching techniques at the end (relaxing and essential!). The last part is based around proper circulation and shows you how to massage your muscles. Which reminds me, if you don't already own enriched lotion (with all the good stuff like vitamins), consider buying some. You can also buy one of those massage brushes, but it's optional. You can use your hands. Anyway, yes this is a much recommended buy.",1433721600,,1157,4.54066985645933

I also don't care about the video being of poor cinematic quality because I didn't buy this video for special effects. The bottom line is, the excersizes are great and if u need more of a challenge then add weights or do more reps or add more excersizes. If it is too hard then decrease the reps. Love it!",1424044800,,445,4.186046511627907
