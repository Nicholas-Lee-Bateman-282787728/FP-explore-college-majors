This takes us from the world we know and brings us back to reality that we as a people sometimes forget. These are real people telling real stories. A look at the lower class working men and women from ""The Gateway To The West"", the City of St. Louis, MO., through the eyes of an Irishman who migrated from Rural West Ireland. The thoughts and opinions of how someone in the working class of another country views the laborers in a big American city is unprecedented. This is an 'outside the box' look that can't be matched by today's standard of film making. If you are tired of documentary's with insincere attitudes and rehearsed screenplays then it's time to get back to the basics. Take a look at the real working class of our nation and their struggles.",1498435200,,931,4.482352941176471
8744700,4,B019D3J41U,"Red Neck + Culchies, a film made by Anthony Monaghan gives an analytical look at the troubles in Americas working class. The film talks about Culchies- country folks in Ireland who are similar to red necks in America.  Most red neck are either English and/or Scottish decedents living in rural Americans. Anthony explains he and other Culchie connect with red necks because they are both hard-working, self-reliant people who are concern with being real.  Anthony interviews people that have worked for his company, Irish Construction, in St. Louis. These interviews reveal the magnitude of the problems working people face with drugs and violence.  As a business owner and a Christian, Anthony is stuck between a rock and hard place; he wants to do what is best for his company, but also wants to help people at the same time.  Anthony often puts people before profits unlike corporate America, he looks at his employees as people not as just a means to the end.
 The film reveals the truth about how helping people is a tough business.  It can be costly and heartbreaking.  The struggle to make a while dealing with addiction, incarceration, and inadequate health care, is nearly impossible according to the testimony of people in this film.  Anthony watches people he attempts to help take one step forward and two steps back, falling in the same old holes. It is admirable and brave to raise awareness by speaking so openly and honestly about things like drug use and street violence.  I enjoyed this movie very much. letting you know.",1476144000,,1539,4.888461538461539

8744704,5,B019D3J41U,"Watched this movie and it really struck a nerve.  Being in my 30's now and having run a contracting company and going through workers I can tell you what a nightmare it can be.  The argument that you just take these people that have problems and push them away is one that fails to take into consideration that in the end these are people that need something to do to stay out of trouble.  In this movie, Tony demonstrates the same problems I have had with workers: self destructive behavior, endless lies, and ironically still the ability to see the human side of them, despite the troubles caused.",1462147200,,599,4.527777777777778

8744706,5,B019D3J41U,"I was lucky enough to be able to see this truly riveting documentary film in its entirety and would like to share that I found it not only remarkably interesting,, but I was captivated by it's powerfully unique perspective of the filmmaker, Anthony Monoghan, who from Ireland with a staunch work ethic and giant heart, leads the viewer through his experiences in the construction industry, managing American working class men. While Monaghan has traveled the world, he conveys that in the heart of the Midwest in America, he discovers an anomaly. He hires hard working men who are often battling various addictions, yet trying to live their lives and provide for their families. This film is chock full of good humor, keen insights into human nature, and tear-jerking moments as the audience is taken along a most unexpected journey into human nature, the pitfalls of society, the working class and the great successes and sometimes failures that we find within the hard working sectors of American society. The cinematography perfectly captured the days and moments of these men, and Anthony's first-hand accounts of his own life and family are touching - adding a very real flavor to this fabulous film. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like a true peek into a class of our society that just isn't seen, but full of very special and interesting experiences that everyone can gain from.",1453680000,3,1396,4.94468085106383
