645097,2,6303439705,"HOLOGRAM MAN is a film from the early nineties that tried to envision a ""Big Brother"" kind of world, with funky looking cars, a biodome over Los Angeles and a nasty corporation running the government.  It's full of hectic shootouts and explosions but doesn't have much of cast or any kind of cohesive plotting.  Joe Lara sleepwalks through his role as Decoda, the cop on a mission, and co-writer/producer/co-star Evan Lurie, muscles ablazing, tries to be a Sylvester Stallone clone, with about as much acting ability.  The effects are cheesy and there's no real logic behind the whole process of holographing these criminals.  And the movie has the most incompetent police force on screen.  If you like lots of firepower and pyrotechnics, then you might find something to like in this subpar feature.",1154390400,,800,4.984962406015038
645098,2,6303439705,"It turns out that this film was made the same year as ""Virtuosity.""  They say Hollywood scriptwriters come up with ideas at the same time.  That is so true here.  I don't know which film imitated which, but they have much in common.  This film also takes much from ""Robocop.""

Evan Lurie not only acted in the film, but directed and produced it.  He played the villain and I would imagine that most people so involved would put themselves in the hero's role.  I'm surprised that a B-movie actor had enough clout to make a film.  Good for him!  Still, he was cowardly in not showing as much of his body as his female love interest shows of hers.

The villain and the hero look so much alike, I had to watch the credits to make sure they weren't the same person, identical twins, or brothers.  During the course of the film, the hero gets promoted but his hair gets longer and his beard gets shaggier.  I can't imagine a public office that would allow a superior to look so ragged.

In this futuristic film, LA is run by a corporation.  Sound fascist to me.  The villain is trying to overthrow it.  Though he's supposed to be the bad guy, I didn't have a problem with someone overthrowing that type of government.

This film had two themes:  what should cops do when a ""bad guy"" has a hostage? and should cops break regulations?  Unfortunately, it never resolves those matters.

This film was just one shootout then an explosion and repeat.  It's tedious after awhile.

I loved that many blacks had roles in this film.  I appreciated the biracial diversity.  However, this is supposed to take place in Los Angeles, a city that is at least 1/3 Latino now and will only be more so in the future.  It made no sense that this film did not give Latino actors a chance to perform.

To the film's credit, it pioneers elements that big-budget Hollywood films may have stolen.  Inmates get frozen:  this tactic was later used in Spielberg's and Cruise's ""Minority Report.""  A mole helps out the bad side just as it would happen in Reeves' ""Matrix.""  The film starts with an unethical black supervisor and his ethic, white trainee just like Denzel Washington's ""Training Day.""  I have to give Lurie points for this.",1152921600,,2203,4.529262086513995
645099,1,6303439705,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing! This is a HUGE load of pants! It's so bad it's on my top ten list of worst movies of all time. Joe Lara is a great actor but he was COMPLETELY wasted! Every other actor was just  plain awful. They were reduced to such garbage. The script and storyline are  seriously PADDED! And Joe looked like a major fag in that white leotard. I  must admit that the FX were decent,but the film is sooooooooooo terrible.  It's as boring as hell and is so heinous that it's laughable. The makers of  this movie should go to a maximum security facility and a million dollar  fine! The film is far too gory and the body count is WAY too high. What a  pathetic waste! Rated R-contains gruesome,gory violence,strong profanity  and a scene of strong sexuality.",956534400,5,783,4.426573426573427

Maybe a decent film in 1995. Today, not so much. Plenty of action. Wasted a lot of cars. Use of CG blasts too. Just too trite.

7846912,3,6303439705,"Hologram Man seems to be a passion project of action regular Evan Lurie, who not only co-leads the movie but also wrote and produced it. Lurie abandoned acting right before the slump of the video market to pursue a career in art and music, but he leaves behind one of the more colorful magnum opuses you can expect to find from B-movie stars. This one is pretty weird and won't appeal to most general viewers, but its also an adrenalized rush and one of the sounder-looking productions from the PM Entertainment library.

The story: Imprisoned in holographic state for five years, a vicious anarchist (Lurie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer-2/dp/B00009MEBV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer 2</a>) achieves near-immortality upon being sprung by his gang, and the only one who can bring him down is the cop who arrested him in the first place (Joe Lara,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarzan-The-Epic-Adventures/dp/B000X6T8Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarzan: The Epic Adventures</a>).

Lead star Joe Lara is a goofy hero of yesteryears low budget scene, and the movie features a surprisingly great cast that includes Michael Nouri, John Amos, Joseph Campanella, Alex Cord, Arabella Holzbog, Tiny Lister, Derek McGrath, William Sanderson, and Nicholas Worth, but Id be lying if I wrote that Lurie doesnt steal the movie out from under all of them. His character  Slash Gallagher  belongs among the ranks of villains so cheesy and overblown that they become spellbinding, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sho-nuff/dp/B00005JD5H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sho'nuff</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Kreese/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Kreese</a>. Lurie shows off his aptitude for action well enough, but for once, the bulk of the strength he brings to the movie is in his presence, which he accentuates via some memorably overblown delivery and the worst braids ever seen on the head of a white man.

The movie is full of weird ideas, beginning with the notion that a persons consciousness can be extracted into digital form  a digital form that can be encased in synthetic skin, shoot electricity at people, and attack you through your computer monitor. If you cant roll with that sort of thing, don't even bother with this one, but it will give you some great times if you already know what you like. It helps that this one clearly has a decent budget behind it, and a production design thats more balanced than the B-movie norm; the world largely looks like something that could actually develop, with only hints of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B00T73AO0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B00003CXCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;influences here and there. The message of the movie  about the potential of improperly-harnessed technology to infringe on civil rights  feels a little out of place but is still a nice touch.

Disappointingly, the action can be lacking: the numerous shootouts are generally filmed better than the low-budget norm but get repetitious after a while, and there aren't enough fight scenes for my taste. The final showdown is an awkward green-screened thing ala the VR brawls of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expect-No-Mercy/dp/B00030WW58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expect No Mercy</a>. The film would have earned a higher rating had it delivered in these areas, but honestly, it just misses out even as it is. Particular fans of Evan Lurie will like it, and lovers of low-grade sci-fi will also have a ball. Know yourself before you buy this, and don't hesitate for too long if you think this might be for you.",1444608000,,3998,6.402597402597403

No Oscar nominations. Just good old fationed actioned and superpowers. This would have been a great lead off movie for a series. The fight scenes were great, just the right amount of romance, but there could have been a little less of the shootouts. Joe Lara is one of those actors that should have been a bigger star, but since he is imprisoned in these B-Rated movies, at least he is doing good work.

7846919,3,6303439705,"The Good Things:
-It was only five bucks!
-Special effects are a little antequated, but still passable.
-There's plenty of action throughout.
-The guns that shoot explosive rounds are cool!
-The bad guy was great.
-Some interesting ideas; LA in a biodome, a corporation running the city, prisoners stuck in holographic stasis...

The Bad Things:
-Some lines contradict the action.  Some of it was downright cheesy.
-Characters are typical, almost like stock characters.
-There are a few boring bits.

It's a B-rated movie that's not as bad as it could have been.  The characters and plot are a little bland, but it is pretty exciting and has some interesting ideas and scenes.  It's not as great as ""RoboCop"" or the ""Matrix,"" but would be a good compliment to something like ""The Lawnmower Man"" or ""Virtuosity.""
