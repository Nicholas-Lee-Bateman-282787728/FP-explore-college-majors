2992305,2,B000WUUNSC,This is less a review for the show than for Amazon's ridiculous price.  $29.95 for a show most people recorded?  And about 90 mins.?  Give me a break Amazon!,1193529600,6,157,4.344827586206897
2992306,5,B000WUUNSC,"From the very begining, It starts with the notion that can't be negated by anyone.<For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. It's one of the fundamental laws of physics -- of nature. Nothing occurs in a vacuum in the natural world. There are ripple effects > we should bear this fact in mind when we do somthing to our planet.
this documentary reminded me that what we(mankind) did for our benefits has posed a great threat to our planet. But on seeing this, I realized we still have a grip on moderating the damages we've caused. In terms of that, i was tremendously impressed by the segements related to inserting wolves in the yellowstone park. that was one great demonstration showing me that our efforts to save our planet can make a siginificant differences !( Actually, I was toooo ignorant that one specie is capable of playing such a meaningful role in the nature!!! )
furthermore,I was so shocked that people in africa emitting the least amount of CO2 have been suffering that much from the global warming.
It is really platitude to say this but How ironic this is!!!
It makes me feel so bad about them and become conscious of what I squandered..
I personally thanked CNN for letting me
be educated germane to grave problems we are facing which need to be rectified anytime soon. I hope by buying this DVD you can learn something out of this~~~",1193356800,32,1371,4.622950819672131
2992307,5,B000WUUNSC,"Breath-taking. Enlightening. Emotional. Touching. Pivotal. Humbling......A Masterpiece.

""Planet in Peril"" erases all lines on the map. Africa is at our doorstep. China isn't so far way. Madagascar is not just a fantasy. The Amazon jungle is our forest. Greenland is in our back garden. A Breath-taking journey...

One land. One people. One family. One struggle.

The wildlife and animals on our beautiful planet are the most delicate of our creatures. They cannot speak literally, but through their beauty and sound we hear them all around us. However, day by day that universal ""song"" is becoming quieter. If we could no longer hear them, the silence and loneliness would break our hearts. We would be alone, and how frightening that would be.

Common sense would tell us that we would be next...

""Planet in Peril"" conveys the striking contrast of the joy in perfect beauty and the sadness of perfect misery. To hear and feel the emotions as dear fellow humans, fellow family members, explain their fear, pain and sorrow over human losses that can never be compensated by anyone except God.

We should all be grateful that ""Planet in Peril"", took the time to document and show us the big picture of what is happening to our planet, to our home. To listen and learn. Humbly.

What we don't treasure we often lose.

""Planet in Peril"" causes one to reflect upon the fact that we must wake up and realize we are the caretakers of this earth, it's our duty. Our sacred duty.

A Masterpiece...

It covers global warming, the capture and sale of endangered animals on the black market, pollution, deforestation, etc. CNN did a wonderful job of making it interesting enough to hold the attention span of a typical high school student but in keeping it informative. The main reporters are Anderson Cooper, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, and Jeff Corwin. They go to China, South East Asia, Yosemite, Brazil, and Madagascar, to name a few of the locations. My hope in showing this movie is that maybe one of my students will become an environmental scientist to help stop some of the problems showcased in this movie OR maybe they will realize that humans are part of the problem and step up to the plate to help protect the planet....use less water, don't buy illegal animals, etc...just a thought...",1436227200,4,1037,4.864406779661017

Planet in Peril is truly a fascinating video that educates you on many of the issues facing out planet today, and how it relates to us...the humans that populate the planet.
They did an excellent job taking issues we do not want to think about and connecting how our lose of species thousands of miles away, droughts in other countries, and how we are polluting our planet, has put our planet in peril.

These two & their cohorts present the ""bad news"" very professionally. But as with Leo DiCaprio's ""The Eleventh Hour"" and the new ""End of Poverty? Think Again""...it's too late for any permanent fixes. We do not have the knowledge bank, technology, remaining assets or required leadership to survive much longer.

I purchased this DVD years ago after seeing a segment on CNN.  I have found that it appeals to all audiences.  I showed it to some teenagers recently; and then, posed the question-""If not us, who?""

The reason it is sooo long is that it was made for television and the editors didn't edit out any the commercial transitions. One must endure constant reviews of what was just covered as if the commercial it edited out (thankfully) had caused the viewer to forget what was covered just before the commercial.

We are loosing the rain forest & there are a few Under-paid ppl trying to protect it before we loose the creatures that live there Forever. I honestly think that all creatures have a Purpose for something,whether it's keeping balance of animals in check,spreading seeds,fertilizing,ect.and if we wipe them out things can go down hill in a hurry and allot of plants are used to make all sorts of Medicines from plants in the rain forest inc. drugs used for cancer patients,which reminds me of the Movie ""Medicine Man with Sean Connery"",if you've not seen it buy/rent it and it was also about the Amazon.

2992348,5,B000WUUNSC,"This documentary made by CNN's journalists Anderson Cooper and Dr Sanjay Gupta and Animal Planet's wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin is an excellent eye-opener on climate change and species loss our planet is facing right now.
The first DVD starts addressing the issue of wildlife trade in Thailand. Anderson Cooper follows a Thai police raid in an outdoor market in Bangcoc. They map out a plan to arrest wildlife dealers but when they arrive at the market all the stores are closed probably because someone tipped of the dealers. Then Anderson gives useful information about wildlife trade, how profitable it is and how difficult it is to stop this in a poor country like Thailand. He also gives us stunned information that the two main markets for wildlife is America as pets, and China as food ! Afterwards Dr Sanjay Gupta goes to Beijing to figure out more about China's habit of eating wildlife. Equally stunned is the intensive use of wildlife in China's traditional medicine. Putting altogether in the context of China overpopulation and economic growth we can realize that species loss will not stop.
Then, Jeff Corwin goes to Madagascar to show us the impact of deforestation on species loss. He correctly points out the relationship between deforestation and poverty as, like in Madagascar, the tropical forests in the planet are in poor countries where the forest itself is the only wealth (wildlife and wood) people have. From Madagascar to the Yellowstone National Park in Colorado, Anderson Cooper checks out the effort and success of re-introducting the once vanished gray wolf made by environmentalists in the United States.
In the second DVD, Anderson Cooper goes to the Amazon in Brazil to check out how deforestation is contributing to the greenhouse effect. We can realize how difficult is to protect Amazon given its immensity.
Then the journalists show us the impact of climate change presumably caused by greenhouse gases and the rise in planet's temperatures (some scientists and politicians disagree even in the United States). Jeff goes to the Artic where ice is melting at a staggering speed and polar bear population is lowering. And Anderson goes to Greenland where new islands are cropping up as ice melts. Both point out the aftermath of melting which is the rise of oceans. So, Dr Sanjay goes to a remote island in southern pacific which is thought to be sinking. We can forecast that the poor populations of third world countries will be among the  first global warming losers.
Finally Dr Sanjay checks out in China the information that people are getting cancer from poluted water caused by waste products of China's new factories. And Anderson tells us insightful information about people getting cancer in the United States from polluted air. Again the people more exposed to toxins are the poor one who live in neighbourhoods next to highly pollutant factories.
The net effect of all these changes caused by mankind on the Earth is the main message of this excellent documentary made by CNN, i.e., our planet and ourselves are in great danger once nothing to change in the near future.",1209600000,3,3120,5.0

I returned 1 copy due to the DVD (Disc 1) not wanting to start/run correctly, but the 2nd copy received had the exact same issue so maybe it is just developed that way.

The only way i could get it to play was to select and play each chapter individually, but there is a issue with that too as the chapter starts over automatically when it completes.  Frustrating to say the least.  Also, not very well edited with regard to commercial spots.  Again, content is truly amazing but CNN really could have done a better with overall product.

this documentary reminded me that what we(mankind) did for our benefits has posed a great threat to our planet. But on seeing this, I realized we still have a grip on moderating the damages we've caused. In terms of that, i was tremendously impressed by the segements related to inserting wolves in the yellowstone park. that was one great demonstration showing me that our efforts to save our planet can make a siginificant differences !( Actually, I was toooo ignorant that one specie is capable of playing such a meaningful role in the nature!!! )
furthermore,I was so shocked that people in africa emitting the least amount of CO2 have been suffering that much from the global warming.
It is really platitude to say this but How ironic this is!!!

3226804,5,B000WUUNSC,"Breath-taking. Enlightening. Emotional. Touching. Pivotal. Humbling......A Masterpiece.

""Planet in Peril"" erases all lines on the map. Africa is at our doorstep. China isn't so far way. Madagascar is not just a fantasy. The Amazon jungle is our forest. Greenland is in our back garden. A Breath-taking journey...

One land. One people. One family. One struggle.

The wildlife and animals on our beautiful planet are the most delicate of our creatures. They cannot speak literally, but through their beauty and sound we hear them all around us. However, day by day that universal ""song"" is becoming quieter. If we could no longer hear them, the silence and loneliness would break our hearts. We would be alone, and how frightening that would be.

Common sense would tell us that we would be next...

""Planet in Peril"" conveys the striking contrast of the joy in perfect beauty and the sadness of perfect misery. To hear and feel the emotions as dear fellow humans, fellow family members, explain their fear, pain and sorrow over human losses that can never be compensated by anyone except God.

We should all be grateful that ""Planet in Peril"", took the time to document and show us the big picture of what is happening to our planet, to our home. To listen and learn. Humbly.

What we don't treasure we often lose.

""Planet in Peril"" causes one to reflect upon the fact that we must wake up and realize we are the caretakers of this earth, it's our duty. Our sacred duty.

A Masterpiece...

3226845,5,B000WUUNSC,"This documentary made by CNN's journalists Anderson Cooper and Dr Sanjay Gupta and Animal Planet's wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin is an excellent eye-opener on climate change and species loss our planet is facing right now.
The first DVD starts addressing the issue of wildlife trade in Thailand. Anderson Cooper follows a Thai police raid in an outdoor market in Bangcoc. They map out a plan to arrest wildlife dealers but when they arrive at the market all the stores are closed probably because someone tipped of the dealers. Then Anderson gives useful information about wildlife trade, how profitable it is and how difficult it is to stop this in a poor country like Thailand. He also gives us stunned information that the two main markets for wildlife is America as pets, and China as food ! Afterwards Dr Sanjay Gupta goes to Beijing to figure out more about China's habit of eating wildlife. Equally stunned is the intensive use of wildlife in China's traditional medicine. Putting altogether in the context of China overpopulation and economic growth we can realize that species loss will not stop.
Then, Jeff Corwin goes to Madagascar to show us the impact of deforestation on species loss. He correctly points out the relationship between deforestation and poverty as, like in Madagascar, the tropical forests in the planet are in poor countries where the forest itself is the only wealth (wildlife and wood) people have. From Madagascar to the Yellowstone National Park in Colorado, Anderson Cooper checks out the effort and success of re-introducting the once vanished gray wolf made by environmentalists in the United States.
In the second DVD, Anderson Cooper goes to the Amazon in Brazil to check out how deforestation is contributing to the greenhouse effect. We can realize how difficult is to protect Amazon given its immensity.
Then the journalists show us the impact of climate change presumably caused by greenhouse gases and the rise in planet's temperatures (some scientists and politicians disagree even in the United States). Jeff goes to the Artic where ice is melting at a staggering speed and polar bear population is lowering. And Anderson goes to Greenland where new islands are cropping up as ice melts. Both point out the aftermath of melting which is the rise of oceans. So, Dr Sanjay goes to a remote island in southern pacific which is thought to be sinking. We can forecast that the poor populations of third world countries will be among the  first global warming losers.
Finally Dr Sanjay checks out in China the information that people are getting cancer from poluted water caused by waste products of China's new factories. And Anderson tells us insightful information about people getting cancer in the United States from polluted air. Again the people more exposed to toxins are the poor one who live in neighbourhoods next to highly pollutant factories.
The net effect of all these changes caused by mankind on the Earth is the main message of this excellent documentary made by CNN, i.e., our planet and ourselves are in great danger once nothing to change in the near future.",1209600000,3,3120,5.0

I do appreciate what CNN is doing by helping make our society more aware.",1198195200,2,417,4.581081081081081
3226851,5,B000WUUNSC,"I was so taken with the program on CNN that I hoped I could then find it on DVD to give to my son-in-law for Christmas (they refuse to get cable). Thank you for making this available just in time for my Christmas gift list!  It really is a good series ... highlighting the hot spots in the world and giving you a desire for more knowledge in many of the areas. How sad that we as a species are destroying what was a phenomenal gift ... all for the almighty dollar... which will have no value at all once we've destroyed all else!

Shipping was fast and the set is now all wrapped up to put under the tree ... Merry Christmas!",1197331200,19,625,4.073170731707317
3226852,5,B000WUUNSC,"Excellent documentary and an eye opener about how modern Civilization and mankind in general are affecting the only planet in the Solar System to harbor life as we know it and so far what we know of the Universe! It's time for everyone to raise to the occasion by saving the planet and develop alternative, sound, and healthy technologies that can help reverse the current detrimental and dangerous path that will affect every living being on Planet Earth.",1197331200,4,456,4.858974358974359
3226853,4,B000WUUNSC,"I am looking forward to watching this DVD, but after Anderson talks for the first 2mins on disc one, the DVD jumps back to the main title screen...
Anyone elses do this?",1195603200,,169,4.3125
3226854,1,B000WUUNSC,"Movie may be good, but the price is just crazy high. I can buy it on iTunes for four dollars. Thats not a typo either.",1193875200,13,118,3.76
3226855,5,B000WUUNSC,Wow. Unbelievable. Frightening. Frustrating. Informative. I watched both nights of the documentary and couldn't believe my eyes. It was incredibly upsetting. I hope that everyone watches this and walks away realizing that we need to make changes and not down the road - but here and now. Well done!!,1193875200,3,299,5.122448979591836
3226856,5,B000WUUNSC,"Planet In Peril is a very informational and fascinating piece to watch. You're educated about the issues facing the planet and how it all relates to you. So you might say how losing species thousands of miles away doesn't affect you or how pollution and drought in another country doesn't affect you either, this will make you look at things a little bit different. Planet In Peril will open your eyes to the issues facing us and future generations, it will compel you to act and maybe even go out and buy compact fluorescent lightbulbs. This film is a wonderful piece of information that needs to be seen by every single person on the face of the Earth.",1193529600,11,654,4.5508474576271185
8225744,4,B000WUUNSC,"I found it quite depressing.  It makes nit want to buy any thing from a China ever again, with their culture of abhorrent animal welfare attitudes.  The sheer ignorance and care for the animal kingdom they're raping but nothing but greed, and supposed health benefits slaughtering endangered wildlife for the species parts and pieces.  The U.S. and the West are as complacent, with their own greed and supposed desire for endangered species body parts.  Our species is truly disgusting and disheartening with regards to the rest of our worlds species.

I gave it 4 stars, because though a new CD, the second two sections of Part Two of this series we couldn't watch. The disc kept skipping and freezing, prohibiting us from watching those two chapters.",1516665600,,752,4.936507936507937

8225747,3,B000WUUNSC,"This CNN report, running about three hours, presents a wide-ranging but rather superficial view of some major problems facing the world.  It deals with four issues, 1] illegal wildlife trade and extinction from environmental destruction; 2] global warming, 3] environmental pollution, and its effect on health 4] and to a lesser degree population pressure.  The problem here is that by trying to address all these issues simultaneously, it does not really address any of them in depth.  Further, it skips around from one topic to another, making it difficult to create a coherent narrative.  The program would have been better if it had been more narrowly focused.  Despite this, it contains some useful insights.",1494806400,,713,5.219298245614035

8225752,1,B000WUUNSC,"The first half of the show was great,  it's too bad the other DVD didn't play on any of 10 different devices we tried.  This seems to be an issue with this manufacturer.  We purchased it from Best Buy and there was a different manufacturer on the case and it worked great.",1468886400,,272,4.1923076923076925
8225753,2,B000WUUNSC,It's a very interesting documentary.  The reporting and filming seem to be of very high quality.  It covers ecological issues from all over the world.  Too bad the second DVD was defective and unplayable.,1450569600,,204,4.9411764705882355
