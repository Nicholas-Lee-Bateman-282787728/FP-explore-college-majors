1901081,2,B0000A14TI,"Probably she's still too little to enjoy it, but this one doesn't make her sit still for long, compared to ABCs and Numbers DVDs.  Hopefully, that'll change when she gets older.",1141344000,,177,4.709677419354839
1901082,5,B0000A14TI,"Perfect for teaching toddlers about good manners - they always listen to Barney! Not only is it the usual Barney and friends fun, it helps little ones to remember to say ""please,"" ""thank you,"" inside voice/outside voice and cleaning up after yourself. My 2-year-old has so much fun watching it - and is learning good manners too! The ""Please and Thank You"" song is very catchy, and everyone is on their best behavior at the fantastic party. The ""Topsy Turvy Tea"" from the Alice in Wonderland sequence is also a favorite... including a hilarious one-liner for the parents!",1122940800,16,571,4.836734693877551
1901083,5,B0000A14TI,"When I got this video I was amazed at how quickly it became my 25 month old's favorite tape.  He watches it over and over again.  He can't get enough of it.  He began saying ""Thank you mommy"", ""Please"" and ""Excuse me"".  The songs are upbeat and the theme of manners is direct, yet fun.",1115337600,3,285,4.127272727272727
1901084,5,B0000A14TI,"I've read other reviews about how annoying Barney can be, but there is alot worse than Barney out there.  The kids love him, and there is an educational component to his DVDs. This is one of the better ones.  The songs are about sharing, washing and other behaviors we want to encourage.  I for one would rather my children be listening to a dinosaur sing about inside voices than watching mindless cartoons.",1070582400,34,408,4.638888888888889
1901085,5,B0000A14TI,"As a father of four year old twins, this is a life saver on road trips. Grant it, they are 4 and still watch this. I have went through several of these different dvds. I don't know how to rank Barney, but if it keeps my children's attention, I have to give it a 5 star rating.",1470614400,,276,3.8596491228070176

1901089,5,B0000A14TI,My nieces and nephew love this video.  I bought it when my sister was having issues with their manners.  She made a comment about needing Barney and since  I am the queen of finding stuff online  (according to my family) I ordered it. They have watched it multiple times.  I have even heard them  (and their mom) quote it.  lol,1433548800,,327,4.35

1901102,5,B0000A14TI,"Barney has been one of the favorites for kids for a long time. I can tell my brother and cousins enjoy this show so much, and they also learn in the process, that is for sure.

I have nothing to dislike about this DVD and I would recommend it to anyone with little kids at home.",1397174400,,278,3.9642857142857144

1901104,5,B0000A14TI,"Since my grandson loves Barney, this is a good way to teach him great lessons in life. He is so unaware how much he is learning because Barney and his friends makes it so much fun!!!!",1389052800,,183,4.111111111111111
1901105,5,B0000A14TI,"I have it on good authority that my grandson absolutely loves his Barney DVDs.  He is only 2 and has taught himself to insert, play, stop, and remove DVDs.  He  cannot get enough of Barney.",1378684800,,189,4.3428571428571425
1901106,5,B0000A14TI,my daughter loves Barney and she watched this dvd numerous times and would recommend it to anyone who has a kid who likes barney,1377475200,,128,4.375
1901107,5,B0000A14TI,I am glad you had this to purchase. It is so hard to find valuable TV programming and this is GREAT. We allow our child to watch Barney only during breakfast and lunch to assist in limiting TV exposure. Hard to find quality programming these days.,1375833600,,247,4.391304347826087
1901108,5,B0000A14TI,I recommend this DVD for those with small children.  It is excellent for teaching and/or supporting why it's importatnt to use good manners!  My son loves it.,1367020800,,158,4.814814814814815
1901109,5,B0000A14TI,Very happy with this movie. Great songs and teaches good values of sharing. My 3 year old and 18 month love it!,1361923200,3,111,4.090909090909091
1901110,4,B0000A14TI,"The DVD was a great movie my daughter enjoyed it , I gave it 4 stars because the DVD was distroyed when I recieved it , and the middle of the DVD doesn't play, and the discription didn't say it didn't play just that it was previously viewed. Aside from that what she got to watch she loved (she's 4 yrs old)",1356393600,,307,3.967741935483871
1901111,5,B0000A14TI,I love this era of Barney movies.  My 10 year old loved them when he was little and now my 1 year old loves them.,1354838400,2,113,3.52
1901112,3,B0000A14TI,Barney is a wonderful character. I only wish there were less people and more speaking from Barney. Definitely not for children under the age of 2.  Too much going on and to many background distractions.,1335225600,,202,4.771428571428571
1901113,1,B0000A14TI,"This video has the characters acting out bad manners at the dinner table and they do it in a way that will have your kid laughing, then afterwards it shows good manners, but to make the bad manners funny defeats the purpose, your kids may end up picking up some more bad manners they didn't know yet and think it's funny. Not a good movie in my opinion, i'd recommend going with the Dora Manners Movie instead.",1321401600,2,410,4.337662337662338
1901114,5,B0000A14TI,My daughter can't stop watching Barney. And from what my wife tells me that our daughter interacts with the Barney and her manners afters this DVD has taken a total 360 turn. Not that we didn't try to install that type of behavior in her. But in my opinion kids tend to follow example from what they see on TV than from their parents. That is why I have invested my time in getting all the learning DVD's for her and encourage her and this is one of many DVD that she likes.,1307664000,2,474,4.10752688172043
1901115,5,B0000A14TI,"My son started watching this when he was 2 and now at 3 almost 4 he still loves Manners Barney.  This one has some fun scenes that aren't like a typical Barney episode.  They talk about everything from washing your hands to inside, outside voices.  I have used it when correcting my child's behavior with success.",1297382400,,313,4.553571428571429
1901116,4,B0000A14TI,"My little one is two. She really doesn't understand how to implement what they are talking about from the video, though she likes it and knows the words and dances to all the songs. Very entertaining.",1284595200,,200,4.583333333333333

1901118,3,B0000A14TI,It's ok. I had high hopes. But I was dissapointed after watching it with my son. He (who was 3 at that time he got it) watched it a couple times. After that - no more. Even though he loved Barney.,1260403200,,196,3.8048780487804876
1901119,5,B0000A14TI,"My kids have always loved barney. They have learned so much from him. But this DVD has actually been a huge hit with my 5yr old and my 3yr old because they have noticed that Selena Gomez is in it. She is much younger of course but now she is in ""wizards of Waverly place"" and they love being able to see her younger. Plus I love the reference to Alice in Wonderland.",1235433600,,366,4.027397260273973

1901121,4,B0000A14TI,"only there was a song about listening to Mom and Dad.  Otherwise, this video is everything the other reviews state: catchy songs and great messages.  The day my 2 1/2 year old watched it, she started applying what she learned, it was a beautiful thing.",1201305600,6,252,4.5777777777777775
1901122,5,B0000A14TI,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this DVD!  She's an afficianado of Barney, but this is by far her favorite to date.  She knows all of the songs and loves to use her good manners just like Barney does.  It's a wonderful compliment to parents who are teaching ""please"" and ""thank you"".",1185148800,,284,4.320754716981132
1901123,2,B0000A14TI,"I can honestly not give it a rate at this time (I guess I have too)

my daughter is only 2 years old and she just

started to be a little afraid of person with Mask.

And there is a part in the movie where the children

are dressed up with mask, and she asks me

to take it off.

But keep in mind BARNEY in general is a

very educational and entertaining movie for the kids.",1174262400,,374,3.779220779220779
1901124,5,B0000A14TI,My son likes this so much and he is totally attracted by the messages passed through the nice songs. He has been watching this since he was 18 months and still (he is 3 now). It is so interesting especially with its lovely songs. However in addition to being so interesting and exciting it teaches the toddlers the main manners in an indirect way.,1166054400,2,347,4.4375
