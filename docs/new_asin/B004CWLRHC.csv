4329230,5,B004CWLRHC,I owned the U.K. series with Mr. Kenneth B.and the only difference is his character wallander drives volvo X-C90 & This version Saabs.,1344384000,,134,4.869565217391305
4329231,5,B004CWLRHC,"i love love love wallander.  the scenery is beautiful, the stories are original and interesting, and you want to know more about the characters.  i love watching these over and over and cant wait for the second season to come out!",1322438400,,230,4.585365853658536
4329232,5,B004CWLRHC,"I devoured the Wallender books when I discovered them and was looking forward to Branaugh's series--with trepidation. My trepidation won at on that one. Branaugh is all wrong for the character. It should have been played by Bian Cox. Branaugh is too healthy and way over the top; and the tone of the series is so bland, typified by the weathercaster delivery of the actress playing his daughter. Therefore, after reading the reviews for the Swedish version, I took the plunge and was joyfully surprised. I cannot say enough about the integrity of this series. THe direction and tone of the shows are pitch perfect, and the acting leaves me breathless. Have no fear, Wallender is still here!",1311984000,5,690,4.8559322033898304
4329233,5,B004CWLRHC,"I love the author Henning Mankell and very much enjoyed Kenneth Branaugh's English film versions of some of Mankell's mysteries. Just recently, I obtained these Swedish films of Mankell stories. The lead actor is excellent [as is Branaugh], as is the actress who plays his daughtere, and the stories are interesting. I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys well done mysteries and who does not have a thing about subtitles.",1304899200,,428,5.042253521126761
4329234,5,B004CWLRHC,"The DVD's are amazing, somewhat dark subjects, but I like the genre. Some are not for the fainthearted. These Swedish made are amazing! I liked the Brit version, but these have that little extra. Sad they had to discontinue because  Johanna Sllstrm
died. She was very good as Linda Wallander, thru my researching the subject I found that she was battling depression most of her life and  after surviving the tsunami in Thailand she was unable to cope - So sad....so young (32) hope she is in a better place......
The swedish version is the better one, but I'm still going to continue with Kenneth Branagh's version as they come out.
As one can see these really caught my attention, totally riveting.
Got all the swedish versions and bought from ""blowitoutahere"", a super seller on amamzon.com.
Can't say enough about their customer service, speedy shipping, just great!",1301097600,14,869,4.904761904761905
4329235,5,B004CWLRHC,I'm only going to submit one review for all the WALLANDER videos (series) I purchased. I loved them. I prefer this series in Swedish  with English subtitles over the English versions.,1421193600,,183,4.903225806451613
4329236,5,B004CWLRHC,"This series is on the noir side of things and has well developed, unpredictable characters in often unpredictable stories. I had a technical problem with series 1 in that the panning motions seemed to be jerky instead of smooth. Season 2 had no such problems. In spite of this I am enjoying the series. Comparing it with Branaugh's version is ""apples and oranges."" They are both great. The subtitles are easy to read and don't intrude.",1420070400,2,435,4.7368421052631575
4329237,5,B004CWLRHC,ALL of Wallander is in my opinion the Worlds Best of TV without a doubt.  Im hooked:),1417910400,2,85,4.0
4329238,5,B004CWLRHC,This is basic DVD information. The region 1 release of the first season of the original Swedish Wallander was done in installment sets. This is the 3rd and set of Season 1.,1413763200,,172,4.40625
4329239,5,B004CWLRHC,"We have watched every episode of all series of this. Absolutely A1. Great story lines throughout. Took up more hours than we could spare,but couldn't stop watching! well worth the bucks!!",1409788800,,187,5.064516129032258

4329241,5,B004CWLRHC,"Good product, pretty much as advertised.  I wish they'd had an English soundtrack.  Subtitles are good, however.",1408320000,,112,5.529411764705882
4329242,4,B004CWLRHC,This series is great.  I love the actor that plays Wallander and prefer to watch the Swedish speaking version (with English subtitles) as opposed to the British version.  The Swedish actor is far closer to resembling the character than his British counterpart.  The series does the author of the books proud!,1400371200,3,308,5.0
4329243,5,B004CWLRHC,This series is absolutely excellent. I would recommend it to anyone that likes detective mysteries as long as you don't mind the subtitles. Fantastic purchase!,1398297600,2,159,5.4
4329244,5,B004CWLRHC,DVD recoring excellent. Disks of high quality and program very very good. Wallander is one of the best crime series.,1397952000,2,116,4.85
4329245,5,B004CWLRHC,If like me your are a fan of this genre then all I can say is you have found nirvana. Wallander is the best!,1389139200,2,108,3.5416666666666665
4329246,5,B004CWLRHC,Enjoyed the previous six episodes and look forward to more after this series continues. It is a great portrayal of Swedish society.,1373587200,,131,5.0
4329247,5,B004CWLRHC,"Love love love these Swedish Wallander stories. A must see for every  lover of Scandinavian crime drama. While the BBC Branagh TV rendition of Henning Mankell's Wallander books are fine, it feels better to see Swedish actors and Swedish landscape in this TV series.",1370390400,2,265,5.0227272727272725
4329248,5,B004CWLRHC,"This series is great. My order arrived in good time in good shape. I could not ask for anything more. Plus, I got a good price.",1363910400,3,127,3.923076923076923
4329249,5,B004CWLRHC,"why don't they add SPANISH subtitles? In latin America this show has many, many fans... This is one of the best police shows I have ever come across together with Criminal Minds.",1363737600,,178,4.59375
4329250,5,B004CWLRHC,"I've come to love the Swedish Mysteries/Procedurals. On the whole, they are grittier and more believable than the typical US product.",1362009600,,133,5.380952380952381
4329251,5,B004CWLRHC,"We got hooked on this series by viewing the second season on cable. I then purchased the entire first season from Amazon. They are much different due to change in the cast. [One of the original actors is now dead.]
I frankly enjoyed the tension between the Wallander character and his boss (in the second season) more than the issues with Wallander's personal life (first season). But they're both better IMO than the well-done copy by BBC starring Kenneth Branagh, apparently for people who can't read subtitles.",1360108800,,513,4.908045977011494
4329252,5,B004CWLRHC,We are hopelessly hooked on this series. Trying to find season 3!Every episode is top rate and the acting is superb.,1360022400,,116,4.571428571428571
4329253,5,B004CWLRHC,"I wish they would collect all of season 1 in a single offering, but it's worth it to purchase the episodes 3 at a time to watch the Swedish Wallander. Henriksson is amazing, and while I also like the British version, I prefer the Swedish. So watch all of them!",1355875200,,260,4.22
4329254,5,B004CWLRHC,"This review holds true for both Year I and II of the Swedish Wallander series. Nothing quite like it on TV, really, with awesome acting, particularly by Henricksson, who can act ""quiet"" better than anyone , with the exception of Alec Guinness in the Smiley TV series.",1353283200,,267,4.702127659574468

8423678,5,B004CWLRHC,"This is one of the best-written cop/detective series ever.  If you are into Scandinavian travel or culture, you'll love this.  We've actually visited Ystad, Sweden, where this was filmed, and stayed in the police station building (which was a train station but is now converted to a B&B).",1477267200,,288,4.979166666666667
8423679,5,B004CWLRHC,"One of the reasons that my wife and I went to Sweden was to visit Ystad in 2o14.. If you watch any of the two Wallanders you have the same impression of Sweden In snow and darkness. Sweden for us Americans is like going home. We know all about Sweden because we have been there before. We have either read the Wallander books or better yet dissolved into the Films of Branagh and Krister. They each poster the Wallander star that is apparent in each series. But, let us not forget the Beck series which  is also available. They are all available from big A.",1453593600,,557,4.304761904761905

8423682,5,B004CWLRHC,"Well worth reading the subtitles, I am an avid Mankell/Wallendar fan. Like the fact that these episodes do not follow the books, that was done by the BBC on PBS. So these are new",1440460800,,178,4.264705882352941
8423683,3,B004CWLRHC,"Good, but not as good as the previous two volumes.....I love Walander!",1437004800,,70,4.916666666666667
8423684,5,B004CWLRHC,Outstanding series ... Krister Heriksson's portrayal of Wallander as he ages in the series is just excellent!,1433808000,,109,5.470588235294118
