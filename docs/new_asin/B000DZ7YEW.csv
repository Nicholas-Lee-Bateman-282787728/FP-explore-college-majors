8102741,5,B000DZ7YEW,My roommate enjoyed this DVD as a anniversary gift. It brought back memories to her and her husband. Rocio sang great cover versions of songs like Amor Eterno written by the talented Juan Gabriel.,1377648000,,196,4.794117647058823
8102742,2,B000DZ7YEW,The songs alone are fine.  The video is not necessary as it consists of shots of Rocio Durcal in her mature age. The video is of slow scans of her body attempting to make her look sexy.  Perhaps she is good looking mature person but the video is not necessary. A plain MP3 or CD would be enough.,1271808000,,295,4.068965517241379

8102745,5,B000DZ7YEW,"Firstly, I love Rocio Durcal!!

This DVD was awesome...it has 5 music videos which include Caricias, Sombras...Nada Mas, Caramelito, Porque Te Quiero and Desaires, all of which were beautifully made. There is also a behind the scenes look at the making of the video for Porque te Quiero.
The rest of the songs (and all of this is in order as it appears) Amor Eterno, Quedate Conmigo Esta Noche, La Gata bajo la Lluvia, La Guirnalda, Como tu Mujer, Te Sigo Amando and Como Han Pasado Los Anos are directly from her ""Concierto Inolvidable"" DVD. I own that one, so it was a little of a disappointment to have that again but other than that, seriously...I CANNOT be more thrilled with this DVD. For the price...it's a great deal.

Suerte xoxo",1220572800,3,738,4.625954198473282
8102746,4,B000DZ7YEW,"If you are a Rocio Durcal fan, you will enjoy this DVD.  You might also think about adding the Jose Feliciano ""Ayer, Hoy y Siempre"" DVD/CD to your collection.  They complement each other.",1149465600,2,187,4.636363636363637
