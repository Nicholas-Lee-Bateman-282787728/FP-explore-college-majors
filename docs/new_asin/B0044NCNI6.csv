8416244,5,B0044NCNI6,"Separation City is one of those movies that for some reason was (in my opinion) badly marketed and not many people know about its existence. It is a very well produced and equally funny movie that involves a serious theme. If you are looking for entertainment and some very pleasant surprises, you should definitely watch this movie. The scenery and the actors are very good and in combination with a very interesting story make this film a must Watch.",1491609600,,452,4.734177215189874
