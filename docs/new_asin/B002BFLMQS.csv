Excellent content and well executed. Sensitive and in depth.

8361276,5,B002BFLMQS,"This is a great bridge-building / discussion-oriented resource like no other that I have seen. Especially on the lightning rod topic of same-gender attraction. I have learned quite a few things from this; most notably a couple of nuggets here:

""Easy to be stereotypically conservative or liberal but desire to chart a third way that creates more of messiness but a place where Jesus would want us to go""

""We often say love the sinner hate the sin, but that is not what Jesus has said. In fact, in many places he demonstrated the opposite: Love the sinner and hate your own sin.""

This DVD does not offer lines in the sand - or how to make a stance on issues. It does not offer simplistic solutions. It works through the complexity and ambiguity as it stands. It can be a great resource for people of any theological stance; however it might frustrate those who want to draw to a conclusion quickly.

It is well-produced, with articulate interviews, and good ancillary questions for group dialogue.

I heartily commend this resource to all people who want to learn, discuss, and live with people who are different than them. One could look at it this way:  This could be a good teaching tool for anyone on how to live with people who are different than them (just using homosexuality as the case in point).",1245974400,4,1307,4.612068965517241
