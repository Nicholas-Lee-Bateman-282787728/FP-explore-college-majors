5879748,5,B00DYZ80WI,Very good.,1414713600,,10,4.5
5879749,5,B00DYZ80WI,"I absolutely LOVE this dvd set!  There are two morning routines to choose from, Rodney Yee is the instructor for the A.M. sets. (A.M. ENERGIZE-30 MIN.) and (A.M. FOCUS-20 MIN.) and an additional (A.M. MEDITATION-5 MIN.)  I have done the a.m. energize routine quite a few times now...as a beginner of yoga, I find the moves
relaxing and refreshing to start my day with.  The music is calming, the setting for all routines are outside on beautiful ocean-sides or
grassy fields. The voice overs are peaceful, and not too fast, I am able to keep up with the instructions. Very professional filming...some at home workout programs can seem almost, for a lack of better term cheesy..but this dvd is not that.  I have done the p.m. unwind, and have very much enjoyed that too..the p.m. sets instructors are Colleen Saidman and Patricia Walden.  The p.m program includes (P.M. UNWIND-30 MIN.) and (P.M. RESTORE-20 MIN.) and an additional (P.M. MEDITATION-5 MIN.)  Overall, I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is looking for a way to ease into a yoga program!  It is great and will remain a favorite in my at home collection for many years to come!",1396310400,20,1155,4.773869346733668
5879750,4,B00DYZ80WI,"I found the Rodney Yee a.m. yoga in VHS version at the library few years ago. The a.m. yoga session was so wonderful; if sleeping is a 1, and sprinting is a 10, it's about a 3 or 4. Gentle and relaxing, yet still considered ""exercise"" if you're just too tired for anything spirited. I was worried that this wouldn't be the same version (there are like 7 different RY AM/PM yogas now!) so I got the double DVD set. (I was looking for the 20-minute session where he's on the beach, in a black bathing suit.) I also tried the other a.m. version, and it's about the same speed. It is truly for beginners, yet a nice way to wake up if you just want to get your body moving and don't have a lot of time.",1391472000,18,697,4.057971014492754

5879755,5,B00DYZ80WI,"If you loved the VHS tape AM/PM Yoga, in particular the AM Yoga with Rodney Yee, you can find it here in a segment called ""AM Focus."" Forget about buying the old VHS tape. I bought the VHS tape 18 months ago and it broke a few days ago. I decided it was time to find a sturdier media, i. e. DVD. Do not be lured into buying other media labeled ""AM Yoga."" This is the only one with the gentle exercises which Rodney Yee made famous in 1999.",1508716800,8,439,3.943820224719101

5879757,5,B00DYZ80WI,Really like the Am Yoga. However the PM Yoga is still above my abilities at this time. I have another DVD that is slower  and more  educational at a basic level from positions to practicing the different Yoga positions than what was presented in the PM version.,1505347200,,261,4.531914893617022

5879760,5,B00DYZ80WI,"I have been having back trouble for the last year and a half. I decided to give Yoga a try after physical therapy did not help at all. All I can say is I'm glad I did, my back has been better than it has been in to long. Rodney's instructions and pace are great for beginner, also I am an overweight person and am able to do all of the moves with just a little modifying.",1492387200,2,371,3.831168831168831
5879761,5,B00DYZ80WI,Gave this to my son for Christmas. He and his girlfriend love it and use it regularly. They like the varied levels and sets.,1491436800,,124,4.208333333333333
5879762,5,B00DYZ80WI,love it,1491091200,,7,3.0
5879763,5,B00DYZ80WI,The hard part is getting myself started! After that a nice relaxing way to start the day. I feel so much better after I dedicate that time to this awakening. I mostly use the AM yoga but have used the PM a couple of times also and it is just as nice.,1490400000,3,250,3.826923076923077
5879764,2,B00DYZ80WI,"The PM Yoga is the least relaxing yoga I've seen.  The yoga instructor ZOOMS through the steps, seemingly unaware that this is targeted for beginners.  She mentions pose names without describing them and moves on.",1480204800,4,213,5.057142857142857

5879769,5,B00DYZ80WI,"I actually buy this for the AM Yoga routine. Have to keep re-buying because I give this away to friends when their backs go out.

AM is only 15 minutes, with easy to follow, basic moves that are very powerful. Anytime one of my family has a back strain (including my uncoordinated husband and my inflexible son), they'll do this once a day for a week and all is well.

PM a little longer with more advanced flexibility moves. Both routines a terrific intro to yoga.",1474502400,6,465,4.395348837209302

5879778,2,B00DYZ80WI,"This is definitely more of a beginners video, very mellow and not very flow/posey...more meditative.  If that make sense.  If this had been my first dvd, I might have loved it but now I feel like I am past this.  The meditation is very nice tho and I am trying to get more into that side of yoga.",1465776000,6,296,4.068965517241379

5879781,4,B00DYZ80WI,"The AM portion is led by Rodney and the PM (a separate DVD) is led by Colleen and Patricia. I really like the AM w/Rodney + his short meditation included that you can choose to stay seated for...or not. It's very gentle, very beginners, but a really great way to start the day. The PM DVD is okay. I do Colleen's set after the treadmill to stretch out and decompress the day. Her voice though... Or maybe it's not her voice, but how she delivers the instructions. It's off putting and can distract you when you're trying to zen out. Her voice comes at you in sort of an ominous way. They could have turned down the level of her voice in post and edited it to make it softer. Overall, a great set either to start out w/yoga as a beginner or to just bookend your day with short, calming 30 minute sessions.",1463529600,2,804,4.2272727272727275
5879782,4,B00DYZ80WI,I liked the Rodney Yee A.M. Yoga video but did not like the instructor on the P.M. Yoga video.  I'm a beginner and she just ran through the movements too fast.  I just use the Rodney Yee video and it suits what I want.,1463356800,6,218,3.9318181818181817

5879784,4,B00DYZ80WI,"I'm a beginner to yoga and have been doing it for about 2 months so I've been searching for good DVD's to branch out with.  I really like both of Rodney's AM sessions, as well as Patricia's PM session.  Colleen drives me nuts, to be honest, which is the reason I've only rated it 4 out of 5 stars.  She does not stop talking...""exhale, exhale, exhale.""  The session would honestly be a lot more relaxing without her leading it because the poses themselves are calming.  So, I find myself avoiding her session.  I wish Patricia's was 30 minutes instead of 20 since hers is my preferred evening routine.",1459468800,14,601,4.518518518518518

5879786,3,B00DYZ80WI,"I purchased this for a friend - I have an old version of Rodney Yee's am & pm Yoga that I've been using for over 15 years.  It's has many of the same stretches but done differently.  He does a better job teaching how you should be breathing and he does more repetition of the same stretches which is nice for the beginner.  I still like my old DVR.  I only watched the am before I gave it to my friend so I can't comment on the 2nd part, but she said she likes it.",1456963200,,464,3.8526315789473684

5879791,5,B00DYZ80WI,Love the easy to do and follow routine. The fact that it's 20 minutes makes me more likely to do it. After doing the restore session I feel so calmed!,1442275200,,150,4.033333333333333

5879793,3,B00DYZ80WI,"I love Rodney Yee's practices, and was looking forward to this after specifically searching for ""Rodney Yee beginner yoga"". I love the AM practices, led by Rodney. However, the PM practices are led by Colleen Saidman and Patricia Walden, and I was disappointed with them overall. After multiple attempts, I gave up on the PM disc and now only use the AM disc, so I feel a bit ripped off and misled. If Rodney had led even one of the PM practices I would have given this a better rating, but I had to buy another video for PM use since Colleen bores and irritates me and I fell asleep every time I attempted Patricia's practice.",1439596800,6,627,4.413793103448276

5879797,5,B00DYZ80WI,I love this dvd pack!!! I have become a person that has to now do yoga daily. The instructions are very clear and easy. I have been doing these DVDs so much that I am now looking at Rodney's other yoga DVDs for a step up.,1427328000,,221,3.8260869565217392

5879799,5,B00DYZ80WI,"I bought this late May 2014 because I hoped for a gentle yoga to relieve the beginning of hip ache, my first sign of aging. I have been doing the A.M. Focus for 8 months now, and it has improved mobility, as stated on the cover. In the beginning, my hips were stiff from not being able to walk regularly due to plantar fasciitis. In the sitting yoga position, my knees were way up, not down on the floor. Now my sitting yoga position is closer to what it should be. Though there are some exercises Mr. Yee does that I can't duplicate exactly, I've come much closer, and become more flexible. Admittedly, I've not yet found a yoga ""for beginners"" DVD that I think is really for beginners, but this one comes pretty close. I've tried some others in the morning, but this a.m. yoga is my go-to most mornings. I've incorporated a few exercises from the A.M. Energize yoga into the A.M. Focus section, because I felt they were more helpful for my hips. In addition to this yoga I have been riding a bike 30 minutes/day for the last 8 months also. I may be ready to move to Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Strength and Flexibility soon. I tried it once or twice. Bottom line, I would recommend the A.M./P.M. DVD, keeping in mind that true beginners need to know to do things at their own pace and capability, but the capability will improve.",1423267200,12,1329,4.362903225806452

8599335,1,B00DYZ80WI,"I purchased this because my friend had it and I thought it was the same one.  Not!  You cannot fast forward through all of the advertising, it does not have the separate workouts (i.e. hip openers, back, etc.) nor can you go to a specific exercise or chapter.  Really disappointed.  Especially with the advertising - it is ridiculously overdone - sell, sell, sell!!",1523491200,,365,4.746031746031746
