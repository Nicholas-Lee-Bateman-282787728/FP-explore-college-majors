2942346,5,B000VKL6SE,"Yes, the show is overly perverted. Yes, the series is short. Yes, it seem to truly lack direction. No, this did not deter me from liking it.

Ninja Nonsense is a rather original show filled with the most randomness I have ever seen in an anime. It's got just the right amount of creepy perverted humor. The show pushes the limits, without going overboard. Each episode is fresh with a slight background story. i watched the opening and decided it was a stupid show and I didn't need to see it. A few months later, I decided to give the 1st episode a try. Then I had to see the 2nd and the 3rd. The story didn't grab me. I just thought it was funny as hell and something different. It's a must watch. At least give it a try.",1303516800,3,723,4.164285714285715
2942347,5,B000VKL6SE,"I've been watching anime since it started getting popular around the mid 90s, if you don't count Voltron when I was a kid, and while a lot of the anime I saw had a kind of superficial appeal (violence and nudity) I never really liked it that much, I was more into films.

NOW THAT I'VE BORED YOU, I want to say I only mentioned that because this is one of the few anime shows I've ever seen that I actually liked.  For the most part, the whole thing is a straight up parody of a lot of the more cliched anime tropes, so to get a lot of the jokes you have to be a little familiar with anime (for example the fact that every anime show seems to have a hot bath episode as an excuse to show naked girls).  On the other hand, there's a lot of actually legitimately funny humor on its own merit, which you don't see in a lot of anime.  In my experience, most of the ""humor"" in anime is along the lines of some generic everyman teenage guy accidentally walking in on a naked girl while she showers, and then he gets a nosebleed (I still don't get that), and that kind of junk.

Overall it's about a ditzy ninja girl in training, at least that's the premise, and then the show goes in any direction it wants from there.  Her ninja master is basically a sentient yellow circle, who is an obnoxious juvenile pig but is actually kind of endearing as a jerky character, which is part of why I liked this show so much, it has a persistently goofy charm throughout with its various characters.

I'm not going to sum up all the rest of the side characters and episodes.  If you like anime, you probably already like this.  If you don't like anime, I think there's still a chance you'll like this.  The same applies to the Ghost Stories anime by the way.",1299715200,2,1739,4.179640718562874
2942348,4,B000VKL6SE,"Really liked this series.  Not too much Fan Service, but it was pretty good nonetheless.  I would say worth the effort.  May even be okay for kids.  Although I would recommend screening it first.",1214179200,3,195,4.647058823529412
2942349,4,B000VKL6SE,"I don't repeat the plots. This is a comedy with some romantic inclination. If you like bad jokes, a somewhat dirty sense of humor, and silly situations this is for you. If you liked Bobobo Bo-bobobo you might like this, but it may be a little less silly. Not by a lot. It is one definitely worth picking up if you like the comedy genre of anime films. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek references to older anime and popular Japanese culture, so reading the Liner's notes in the included booklets is a good idea. There are also some art and other notes you may or may not find interesting, as well as a short Manga. With little fighting and no real bad-guys this is a series driven by characters and the situations they get into (or create). Sometimes the screen is ""busy"" with translations of what's on the screen in Japanese, it's usually worth pausing to read what they say. Some are informative, many are amusing. Overall I liked this series quite a lot.",1202860800,7,957,4.474285714285714
2942350,5,B000VKL6SE,"Ninja Nonsense is just down right FUNNY! Off the wall they say, wacky, and in a suprise, Charming! I must say IMO this is one of the Best Dubs probably in the history of Dub Animes. Perfect Cast! Right Stuf did an AWESOME job. (They really seem to Dub Animes quite well.)  ^_^
Back to the show, if you want to laugh buy it! Simple as that! Warning this Anime is quite nice looking very colorful but NOT for Kids. Second Warning don't eat or drink while watching this Anime you might choke, laughing so hard! =)
Ninja Nonsense will go down as one of the FUNNIEST Animes in History! (I hope.) ^_^",1196640000,17,594,4.256637168141593

8219085,5,B000VKL6SE,"I was very excited to find this little hidden treasure. I had watched episodes on demand but then the show went off demand & i didn't get to see the rest of it. I very even more impressed at the quality of the case, it is thick durable cardboard & very beautiful. The boxed set comes with a booklet that tells all sorts of info about the show. I only wish that the series was longer, but it is so cute and just darling. I love it!!",1366934400,,431,3.9655172413793105
