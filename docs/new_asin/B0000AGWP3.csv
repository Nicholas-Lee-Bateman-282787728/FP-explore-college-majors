1906073,3,B0000AGWP3,"When you think of great war movies that depict great battles of World War 2, you think of The Longest Day, or Saving Private Ryan...True Normandy was a great battle.  However, the landing at Salerno Beach lasted 21 days...

A Walk in the Sun is the greatest representation of this event so far.  Although a lot was going on away from what this film depicts, it never-the-less is one of the best of the War Genre.  A true character study of what men, bonded in the brotherhood of war, go through emotionally and mentally.  Most films to this time had been made showing just the physical aspects of war.  If you have seen The Longest Day or Saving Private Ryan, you will see the influence that A Walk in the Sun has had on the emotional and mental aspect of those films.",1231718400,,768,4.373239436619718
1906074,2,B0000AGWP3,"A good price but there IS a hidden price - the quality of the audio is very poor, at least in ""The Way Ahead/Immortal Battalion"".  Which is really a shame as this was the movie I bought the series for!  In all fairness, there is a disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD in regards to quality - too bad we weren't aware of this before purchasing!",1189728000,6,345,4.134328358208955
1906075,4,B0000AGWP3,"The DVD is worth its value for ""...One of Our Aircraft is Missing"", a priceless gem from the British Film machine that is pro-Free Dutch and RAF, and taughtly crafted by the Archers and edited by (future ""Lawrence of Arabia"" director) David Lean.  The film is technically marvelous, and holds up extremely well today.  The transfer is poor-to-mediocre.  Such a pity that a film that was nominated for two 1942 Oscars (Screenplay and Special Effects) is allowed to be crammed on a DVD of such crummy quality.

""Spitfire""(a/k/a ""First of the Few""), is notable as one of two films directed by actor Leslie Howard, and the last film he starred in before being tragically shot down by the Luftwaffe while on a commercial flight from Spain to the UK in 1943.  This copy of the film is absolutely atrocious, often having no better clarity than grampa's old 8mm home movies.

""We Dive at Dawn"" is a mediocre transfer of a typical wartime British ""huzzah"" pro-Navy submarine film.  Nonetheless, it is very entertaining, if a tad trite for such serious subject material.

All of the actual films merit viewing, as they are interesting, if not downright exciting.  But if you have the opportunity, opt for better-quality individual DVDs for all three.",1187049600,14,1240,4.866666666666666
1906076,5,B0000AGWP3,"I bought this for One of Our Aircraft Is Missing.  I had recorded this movie on VHS several years ago by chance, and it has become one of my favorite war movies, and I have long wished I could get it on DVD in the hopes of getting a better quality recording.

For ""Missing"", the story centers around a British bomber crew who must bail out over occupied Netherlands and try to make their way back to Britain, with the help of various citizens and underground along the way.  I tend to like documentaries, and while this is drama, much of the footage and audio of bomber aircraft is authentic, as the movie was filmed in 1941.  This is not your typical war movie, though, somewhat also like a thriller.  It draws you in, and is cleverly written, making you wonder what will happen next.  The special effects for the time are very respectable.  I wish modern movies could incorporate some of the unusual story-telling production values used.  The transfer of the film is excellent, and has been remastered for multi-channel Dolby, and while there's only so much you can do with a period film's audio tracks, I was amazed how good it sounded over my surround-sound.  I can understand what the crew members are saying when they speak with oxygen masks attached to their faces, something the audio from my old VHS tape copy didn't allow.  The video quality is very good too.  This is not high-definition, but pictures are sharp.  There are some minor film artifacts from the original film, but it wouldn't be noticeable to most.  If you've never seen this movie and don't even care about the other two, buy the DVD just for this one movie.  Movie rating:  *****  Quality rating: ****

(five stars is best possible using my ratings above.  I rate the whole DVD 5 stars just because of this one movie...my lower ratings on the other two movies shouldn't detract from this one movie which more than justified the purchase of the DVD on it's own, so geting two other movies are more like a bonus to me)

""Spitfire"" tells the story of the lead designer of the venerable British fighter aircraft of the same name.  It's an interesting story, but war and history buffs are the main two audiences who'd want to watch this.  Video transfer is only average, likely limited by the original film and perhaps not surprising for an unrestored 60 year old film...somewhat blurry, with muddy audio.  Again, the history and occasional piece of footage from the time acts as a time tunnel, so if you're interested in the subject matter, it may be worth seeing at least once, but if you really want to know about the roots of the Supermarine Spitfire and can dispense with a bunch of make-believe drama, read a good history book on the subject.  Although I don't mind owning it, you can lead a happy life without ever seeing this movie.  This is no ""Dambusters"", which is a terrific example of another real-life plotline where a scientist/designer must overcome red-tape to develop and overcome hurdles on a significant invention.  I'm rating this movie with the presumption you found yourself to this review because you like war movies.  If you like musicals or Bogart or Pulp Fiction, this kind of movie is definitely not going to interest you.  If you liked Aviator, then it may interest you.  Movie Rating: **1/2  Quality Rating:  **1/2

""We Dive At Dawn"" is a good war movie, but not a great war movie.  It tells the story of a submarine crew trying to sink the German battleship Brandenburg, but involves other story telling regarding their families, and some of the trial and tribulations of being at sea.  It has a somewhat lighter tone to it than some other war movies, but is quite interesting in parts.  Again, much of its value to me is seeing some authentic submarine operation from a movie filmed during the time in question.  I'm not sure if any of the actual story is based on fact, but much of the movie's drama is not convincing to a modern day viewer, although I personally don't mind this as it was typical of how movies were made at this time, and it helps one to see what it was like to be living through WWII.  If you've already seen most of the A-list war movies of the 1950's-1970's and are looking for lesser known war movies as I was, this is worth seeing.  The video quality is very good, with sharp pictures and good contrast.  Audio is very good too, though not quite as good as ""Missing"".  Movie Rating: ***  Quality Rating: ***1/2

For all three movies, note they are in black and white, and there are no track marks or scene selections.  I didn't really care about this last point, but sometimes you want to review a scene.  To do so, you can only use your DVD player's fast forward/reverse keys, not track increment/decrement.  Also, there is a special feature called ""Mr Blabbermouth"" which is a curious movie reel showing interesting facts about the Axis' and Allies respective resources, and the defeatist thinking that some people had after Pearl Harbor.",1165276800,29,4968,4.622146118721461
1906077,3,B0000AGWP3,"It was fascinating seeing the first of these - ""One of our Aircraftt is Missing"", in the company of a sixteen year old grandson,  who definitely found it a bit boring in parts, and I was verry struck by the exemplary behaviour of the participants - ideal not real - As an essay in nostalgia, very well made, I enjoyed it, as did my son, who is a film maker anyway;  he was interested in techniques and conditioned,as a child, to such films.  Spitfire, I knew better as ""The First of the Few"" - a far more sensible title, anyway, and it has the same well-made interest and a real story, sentimentally told.  ""We dive at Dawn"" is well acted and has the same archival interest, while appealing to older viewers or film buffs.  Quite moving.",1142726400,9,737,4.389705882352941

7997139,3,B0000AGWP3,"One of Our Aircraft is Missing, 1942 film

This was produced with the co-operation of the RAF and the Royal Netherlands Government in London. In the summer of 1941 five Dutchmen were executed for helping members of the RAF to escape. This is their story. One April morning a British bomber did not return with the others. We see the members of the crew. [Note the blackboard used to record and display data.] Airmen listen to a soccer game on the radio. In the morning they enter their bomber and take off. We see the activities of the crew inside the bomber and their conversation. They fly towards the Dutch coast. There are flashes from anti-aircraft cannon. They first drop leaflets. A log records their journey. Searchlights on the ground sweep the skies. Buildings on the ground burn from the bombing. Their bomber flies lower to drop the bombs. One man destroys a piece of paper.

A hit on their bomber stops one engine, they fly lower. More trouble causes them to parachute from the bomber, the pilot is last. Daylight finds one of their crew is missing. Dutch children hunt for straying farm animals. Their dog finds the fliers up a tree. A safety pin is a symbol to keep quiet. They are brought to a house. A schoolteacher speaks and questions them. Are they who they say they are? They are given food. The sea is 58 km away. Can they hide in a church? Is it the right religion? They have a plan. Wearing clogs is part of their disguise. [If a man is disguised in a woman's dress would his height give him away?] You need a permit to travel in Occupied Holland. Bicycles are used to travel. The Germans found a parachute and are searching for its owner! A local collaborator visits this house and discovers the Englishmen. Was there a mix-up in the gramophone records? [What did they do to keep him silent?]

They travel by boat along a canal to watch a soccer game. They discover their missing crew member at the soccer game, well-disguised! A truck carries them to the seaside where they hide in a warehouse then a home. There is a plan to get them back to England during the next air raid when people seek shelter. This involves some risk from a few Germans. They will use a rowboat to find a fishing boat at sea. They must pass a guarded bridge, which opens to let fishing boats enter the harbor. A guard sees them and shoots at them. George is hurt. They stop at a station used for airmen shot down at sea. Two small boats arrive to rescue them. They must hurry because E-boats are coming. [Equivalent to PT boats.] Next stop Dover. Three months later they are back in service with a newer and bigger bomber. Four engine bombers can reach Berlin.

This is a slower-paced movie than some others from this era. It doesn't have much action and avoids any of the nasty events that were going on. You could read a book to learn more about the events in Occupied Holland at this time.",1358467200,,2893,4.452830188679245
7997140,3,B0000AGWP3,"If you don't have these movies yet, this disc is a bargain, but the quality is not the best.  We Dive At Dawn is the best print, with Mr Blabbermouth, One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing and Spitfire following in that order in quality.  There are video glitches in all from the tape master used.

7997142,4,B0000AGWP3,"This anthology of a trio of Britain's best WWII propaganda films finally allowed me to view ""Spitfire"", a film I had long read about but had yet to see. It also reacquainted me with ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" and allowed me to view ""We Dive at Dawn"" in it's entirety for the first time in aeons! The print quality was not of the best but who cares? At least they're viewable and for the most part understandable (there is the occasional drop-out of sound) and for the price of the disc, and the choices which make up this triumvirate, any and all shortcomings of this disc is forgiven. Besides the three features there is an American short subject ""Mr. Blabbermouth"", not so very funny but understandable considering when it and why it was made. Having been raised at a time when the American-made ""War Films"" were on TV almost any Saturday afternoon (""War Zone"" on KTTV 11 here in Los Angeles), and having seen most all of them a million or so times, it is a welcome experience to see what the ""Brits"" were watching while we were seeing the likes of ""Destination Tokyo"", ""Guadalcanal Diary"" and ""Air Force"".

7997144,4,B0000AGWP3,"Spitfire, a notable documentary from my own youth, hits on all twelve cylinders covering the intense rivalry between nations dureing a relatively brief inter-war period of the 20's and 30's. Specifically the Schneider Cup air races of that same era. Interesting reading if you've had some contact with these seaplane races, you're going to love some of the last remaining photo images of a few of them in this film. Film images more accurately as these planes are moveing, fast; 440mph in one case and still a record for seaplanes for top speed. R.J.Mitchel designed a raceing seaplane for Supermarine in Great Britain includeing a winning design with the S6. B model racer that some say was a predecessor to the Spitfire series of combat fighters of WW2. Two companion features are authentic, wartime representations of combat units in action their familys and friends. It was wonderful reconnecting with these airplanes and their champions in this film. 4 stars for what would otherwise be just another wartime propaganda piece. Spitfire does indeed rise to the occaision in every respect. Thankyou",1260576000,,1100,5.116666666666666
7997145,4,B0000AGWP3,"I always enjoyed ""One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing"", and bought this little set for ""Spitfire"", starring the doomed Leslie Howard as the doomed Reginald Mitchell, designer of the wonderful Supermarine Spitfire and the Supermarine Racer. ""We Dive At Dawn"" is interesting, chiefly to see the difference between the US Navy fleet subs I grew up watching in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Up-Periscope/dp/B00005JN9P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Up Periscope</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Silent-Run-Deep/dp/0792841670/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run Silent, Run Deep</a>&nbsp;and to see old friend John Mills, fresh off his ""triumph"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Which-We-Serve/dp/B0000YEE4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Which We Serve</a>.

One thing I found very interesting was the packaging: ""One Of Our Aircraft, etc"" is about a Lockheed Hudson crew, though the DVD cover shows a Lancaster....and then I went ""Hey, radial engines! What the...?"" Turns out the picture is of a Lancaster II, which was equipped with Bristol Hercules engines, rather than Rolls Royce Merlins. The Hercules performed wonderfully in the Beaufighter and Sunderland, but the Lanc II's bomb load and service ceiling each were only 2/3 of the Merlin-engined Lancs.....which makes even less effective the ill-fated Manchester, which the Lanc replaced.",1254096000,,1489,7.272222222222222
7997146,4,B0000AGWP3,"I'd been watching this one like a hawk and when I saw the bottom of the lowest used price drop out I dove. I know that at least some of these titles were not previously released on digital video disc, at least not in the Region One, so for that reason alone this is a serious must have. Then you SPLAT crush open the jewel case and BOOM burrow out the disc and PLOW press play. Worth what a couple of bucks big time, am I right?

Personally, I think ""We Dive at Dawn"" is the best of the bunch. Here's why. The submarine movie is a better genre than the fire fight. The other thing is that ""One of Our..."" is way over hyped if you feel me. There are so many more fire fight movies than submarine ones. And then there is the video quality factor. Crunch crunch crunch. And who cares which one is better. The utilitarian value of a mediocre quality transfer of a decent movie from a resource scarce genre ought in principle to be greater than a poor quality transfer of a slightly better movie from a genre of flowering abundance. Otherwise put, you really ought to prefer the basically mediocre movie from the nobler genre to the more or less similar movie in the baser genre.

Anyway, this bundle is a good deal if you like movies that are their genre, which this hawk-eyed dove does.",1251158400,,1283,4.275720164609053
7997147,1,B0000AGWP3,"Unfortunately this had a very poor sound track and you could not hear the words because they were all blurred.
