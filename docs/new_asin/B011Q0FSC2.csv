7340039,5,B011Q0FSC2,Love the Movie!!! It comes with all three movies in Digital HD with lots of Bonus features on each disc plus it came with a whole disc of bonus features which is awesome. Also comes with a unique code so you can have the digital version so you can watch it online anywhere.  Very happy with the purchase:),1445385600,23,305,4.258620689655173

7340041,4,B011Q0FSC2,"Just got it today, I preordered it and it came in a entirely made from cardboard packaging which I never like to see. But I look forward to seeing the new bonus footage that came with it and there's a short film as well. All in all its not that bad (could be worse)",1445299200,18,265,3.925925925925926
7340042,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Excellent time travel series that set a standard for good science fiction, that nobody has had any luck coming near.

Most Sci Fi movies, especially movies related to time travel, beat you over the head the whole movie with the Science of how something is happening in the movie, while sacrificing the story.  Back To the Future has one of the best stories ever created and Michael Jay Fox, and Christopher Lloyd made the characters their own.  A remake would just never be possible because no actor, no matter how brilliant, would be able to replace either of them.

I don't really know what special features are included in this edition but it does have a complete video quality overhaul which is more than enough.  I encourage anybody and everybody to see this trilogy at least once and feel the magic that was this series.  It is fun all the way from the beginning until the credits roll after part 3.

My only complaint is that it should have included a free hoverboard....... I WANT A HOVERBOARD!!!!",1445040000,7,1005,4.6440677966101696

7340044,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Howdy;

I give the movies five stars and do have all on DVD, but want to upgrade to BLU.

10-27-15 - Question on four disc or five is no longer a question.  The Blu-ray is FOUR discs and all of the documentaries are included.

I just want to thank all those that replied.  I have seen all the documentaries, now to watch the movies.
Peace out.

7340045,5,B011Q0FSC2,Don't listen to any of these reviews prior to Oct 20th. The item hasn't been released yet. How can there be a 1 star review for something that doesn't exist yet??  Amazon needs to do something about these loons.  Ignore my 5 star rating as well.. (even though we all know it's going to be awesome),1438905600,171,297,4.285714285714286
7340046,4,B011Q0FSC2,It's great that it's coming out In October because my birthday is on the 26 to be precise! When I first saw this movie I was going on 12.. Anyway I've been a fan ever since 1985! The price is not cheap for Blu ray unlike the DVD box set I paid only $34.00 for it not for this its $45.00 to $88.00 not including tax & shipping.,1438905600,3,326,3.8088235294117645
7340047,1,B011Q0FSC2,I love the films but they deserve much more than what we are going to get it's going to be the same grain reduced and artificially sharpened transfers we got for the 25th the films deserve 4k mastered transfer like sony has been releasing with no grain reduction and no artificially sharpened picture. the films by themselves get a 5 out of 5 stars but these transfers get a 1 star. here's a link showing a comparison of back to the future 1 with a better print.

7340052,5,B011Q0FSC2,"This is the greatest trilogy of all time.  Emphasis on time.

I remember watching these movies when they first came out, and they're just as phenomenal now as they were then.  Even after 30+ years into the FUTURE!

Picture quality is better than I ever saw them in the past.  Lea Thompson is smokin' hot (not quite as much as her role in Howard the Duck, something about that frizzy 80's hairdo and her being lead center in a female rock band.)

Fun fact:  When you watch the ending of the third one, pay close attention to the kid playing ""Verne"" on the train.  He sneaked in an ""Easter Egg"" that they didn't find out until after releasing the movie - and it's in this release.  I won't spoil it for you, but that's what google and YouTube is for.",1534204800,,748,4.285714285714286

7340075,4,B011Q0FSC2,"Movies are fantastic, and the bonus features and Blue Ray make the trilogy package worth it.

Dinging one star for the download capability.  When you ""download"" you load it onto your Movies Anywhere account, where it lives in the cloud.  This means it is not a local copy like an mp4 or something, only one you can stream when you have network access.  So you cannot watch on a plane or in the car or anywhere you don't have reliable network access.  ""Movies Anywhere"" is a bit misleading, eh?",1531353600,,493,4.49438202247191

BTTF was released in 1985, during my senior high school year. If I could be any movies character, I would be Marty McFly. These films really seem now like a trip Back to the Past.

Inside the package were TWO copies of movie #2, and ONE copy of movie #3. Movie #1 was nowhere to be found. Two star for the annoyance of having to go to UPS in order to return the one with a missing copy, and reordering. I'm curious if anyone else has run into this problem?",1516579200,2,417,3.9761904761904763

As one of the die-hard fans, thought I'd post a review on the blu-ray collection, not to say how great it is, but give more of a run down of what to expect. There are more vintage featurettes than updated interviews, but the six part documentary is scattered between the three discs. By far, the best interview of the whole thing is the breakdown of science of time travel. It's a time travel take at it's finest, and really hasn't had any other movie match it's blockbuster power.",1511395200,,726,4.549618320610687

7340196,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Brilliant movies that have stood the test of time. I had never seen any of the movies until I bought this set. I was encouraged to buy the trilogy after hearing the Popcorn podcast with Jack Ferry and Mitchel Davis.

The first movie is a classic that I could watch over and over just for the satisfaction of the story and how well it was conveyed by the actors and director. This movie set the tone for other movies that followed it.

The second movie is where it gets totally crazy and amazing. The second movie continually references the first movie and calls back tons of great gags from the first one. I can watch this movie over and over again, only to discover new things that I didn't see the first time. It is incredible how many layers this movie has. It was interesting though, they started this movie using the same ending footage of the first one, AND they gave you basically a free preview of the third one.

The third one is good but lacks the pizzaz that the second one had. It was a little disappointing, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat.

All around great movies that anyone can enjoy. With the blu-ray disc set, these movies are gonna be timeless and I will show my grandkids these movies. 10/10 Popcorns!! Would watch again!",1501027200,4,1254,4.369098712446352

7340271,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Wow, I cannot say enough about what a superb job Universal has done on this classic movie trilogy. This is the review for the 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook Target exclusive with the ""Bonus Disc"" specifically for the 30th. Now, we all know the previous Edition that came out was the 25th Anniversary and had the foldout boxset with slipcover. The same movie blurays are in this set with same awesome extras on each disc.
It is exact, but I am satisfied with it because the blurays look outstanding on the UHD 4K TV and Sony upscaling bluray player. The res is 2160p!
So, no real need to go into the extreme details of all the previous extras, only that they are there from the 25th set. If you do not own that set, you may want to get this one. There are some really good extra features on the Bonus 4th Disc included here.

I saw that Netflix had put them up, so I decided I was going to watch them. Fell in love. When Netflix decided to take them down about 3 or 4 months after they added them, I was very upset. I wanted to watch them so badly when I was still pregnant with my now 2 month old daughter, but couldn't. So, I decided to see if Amazon had the Blu Ray discs, and my husband just recently bought the 30th Anniversary Edition for my for Christmas. I now love these movies. I will forever cherish these movies, and introduce them to my daughter in a few short months. 5 star rating from this BTTF fan!",1484438400,4,751,4.1506849315068495

7340347,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Big fan of the 80s movies and back to the future was a essential movie of the 80's along with star wars, indiana jones, ghostbusters etc....  I must say for a 80's movies  the trilogy looks pretty good for their age.  Am sure it might look better or when a properly made 4k UHD version comes the quality will look even better and sound better.

Anyways enough of the tech stuff the movie had alot of cool things that i liked that many movies of today are trying to mimic or copy for success.  I don't dont have many time traveling movies were good or just as good as back to the future.  When you think about future, past, or time traveling one of things people would suggest is ""u mean back to the future"",  Wish they made another back to the future or the one doc hinted about been there done that now there is only 1 other place to go.. spoiler free... no worries  we all know that place  belongs with star trek mostly..heheheheheeh

Wish i still had my old nike shoes, life vest the baggy jeans, simple solid shirts was a trip down memory lane for me and alot of the 80's kids that was stuck on Doc.

Terms of extras and other things included I haven't seen it all yet but plenty of interviews, trailers, docs, etc to watch.  the digital copies worked or was redeemable for me.  Flixster didn't accept the codes, but vudu did and now i can easily watch the ultraviolet versions on my phone too which is a nice an convenient  thing to have especially now since most new movies or star wars episode 7 should have.

I hope they don't make another blu-ray version or try to milk fans with other versions.  I saw there was a 25th, regular blue ray version, the flux capaciator box, steelbook etc.  I swear if they do that for the 4k version am gotta quit buying back to the future and use my money for other better deals or movies that have 1 version of the movie with all the extras and remastered version in one box.  Not gotta pay 20$ just to get a new trailer, or a new 5 minute interview, but everything else is the same as the previous version and you can get that previous version for way cheaper......",1473292800,2,2108,4.2537688442211055

7340499,5,B011Q0FSC2,"Great Scott! I still remember first seeing BTTF part 1 for the first time when I was 8 on VHS (ah, the glorious 80's). After I finished watching the movie it instantly became my favorite movie and till this day it's still my favorite movie. The entire trilogy is my favorite trilogy, and even though I own them on DVD in various versions I will still watch them on TV. There is just something very magical about the bond between Marty Mcfly and Doc that has me glued to the screen.

The entire trilogy has something for everyone in my opinion. Time travel, romance, humor, Biff Tannen who I love to hate, great sets, and just an overall feel good factor. It's a timeless series, and even though we're now in 2016 I still very much get a kick out of the 2015 that was picturized in BTTF 2. There will never be anyone that can replace Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. I was so happy to watch these 3 movies on the big screen on Back To the Future day.

I loved all of the bonus features on this DVD set (especially the making of the movies), and I will probably buy every DVD of the trilogy even if the bonus features don't change. :-) So, why don't you make like a tree and get out of here and get this DVD set? You know it's your density...I mean destiny to get it. And don't forget, if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything.",1457654400,,1337,4.158301158301159

7340596,4,B011Q0FSC2,"Love the trilogy!!! It is fun to own all the three Back to the Future movies as a trilogy. The last time I watched some of them were in the theater, and the DVD's reminded me why I liked them so much. I love the beautiful detailed sets, the dramatic score with a full orchestra and the light hearted, simplified time travelling universe created by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gales (not mention the fully committed performances by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Thomas Wilson, as Marty McFly, Doc Brown and Biff Tanner, respectively).

I am giving the set 4 stars because it comes with 2 bonus disks with terrible extra features that make you feel like you need a time machine so you can warn yourself not to them. These extras include the transcript of an interview with Bob Gales and Robert Zemekis concerning frequently asked questions. I admit the content was interesting, but having monochrome text that you have to scroll through with your DVD remote seems a little bit like using a cellphone as paper weight.

They also include an episode of the shortlived BTTF cartoon, and a terrible ""update"" to the movie where Doc Brown gives half baked explanations as to why inventions in the movies don't actually exist in 2015. (Basically, he went forward in the future and learned that they all have terrible repercussions so he now has to go back and time and prevent them from being invented.) This extra was a lame, unnecessary and inconsistent clip that looks like it was thrown together in an afternoon and filmed in a storage unit (all the more glaring when compared to Zemeckis meticulously detailed sets). Also, it is an apology for an admirable portrayal of 2015 which includes accurately portraying Google glass, Skype, social media, thumb print scanners, a dog drone walker, and even Katie Perry's 2015 Superbowl sharks.",1453680000,5,1833,4.815873015873016

The DVDs have many extras you'll enjoy and then some
Probably the most-talked about issue of this release is the product's interpretation of the soft matted original cut. If you dig deep enough in Internet sources, you'll read a mixture of positive and negative responses. Fact is, on this 1.85:1 version, you will see less picture information in height, and more in width than the 4:3 version. This movie was shot in soft-matted format, which basically means that the original prints were in a kind of '4:3' format, where in the upper and lower regions there is information that needs to be covered (the microfone syndrome), and was not intended to be part of the screening of the film.

7340719,2,B011Q0FSC2,"One of my first DVD purchases years and years ago, was a BTTF DVD Box Set. I've always loved these films and wanted to own them. Of course, this set was plagued by the Framing Fiasco, where whoever created the discs used horrible transfers. I only found out about the fix (mailing in the discs for replacements) years after the fix ended. I had too much sentimentality over that original box set I spent way too much of my college money on, so I never replaced it.

Until I saw a good deal on the 30th Anniversary Blu-rays. I assumed they would have learned and get the transfers right, but I'm having a lot of trouble actually playing the Blu-Rays. I put them into my PS3 (which plays other discs just fine) and the disc just spins and spins and doesn't load. It took me at least a dozen tries (and sometimes more than a day) to get the disc to play. I waited too long to watch them and see if it was a problem that persisted or was a one off, and now I can't return this set (again).",1448236800,,985,4.157068062827225

7340779,2,B011Q0FSC2,"Universal are at it again releasing this back to the future series on Blu-ray once again
advertising it as 30th Anniversary this time around
the HD transfers for this new 30th Anniversary are the same as the 25th Anniversary transfers
and so is the sound quality which is the same 5.1 Master audio mix
I mean you would think that for a new 30th anniversary the sound quality would be boosted to a new 6.1 or 7.1 mix
just like Lucas did for his Star wars Blu-ray which is 6.1 master audio mix for all 6 episodes
Universal did it for Jaws and added a 7.1 master audio mix for the Blu-ray version
which sounds incredible by the way
but Universal did not bother making that much effort with the back to future series
most of the content on this new 30th anniversary edition is from the 25th Anniversary edition, nearly all of it actually
the setup for the extras is the exact same way as the 25th Anniversary edition
Disc 1 has the feature film plus the Tales from the Future featurettes
plus the archive featurettes from the special edition dvd versions, plus the Deleted scenes, outtakes etc
every extra from the 25th anniversary has been carried over
Disc 2 & 3 have the exact same setup
Disc 4 is the Bonus Disc with the new retrospective Documentary
which is not new at all, apparently this retrospective Doco called
LOOKING BACK TO THE FUTURE was filmed back in 2009 so it's Definitely not new
it must've been a TV broadcast special or somethin'
obviously universal felt the need to add something as a new extra for their 30th anniversary release
there's a featurette on restoring the Delorean called OUTTATIME again not a new featurette
it was filmed back in 2012
DOC BROWN SAVES THE WORLD which Christopher Lloyd talks about the Gadgets
from the series and explains why they don't exist in 2015, pointless waste of time featurette I think
and you get 2 episodes from the back to the future Animated series
that's about it for this Bonus Disc

the U.S. 30th Blu-ray version is foldout case Digi-pak, the U.K. version is a thick Blu-ray case with Disc trays inside it
both versions are all regions so all you have to do is choose which packaging you like best
if you have the 25th anniversary Blu-ray trilogy, not sure if this new 30th anniversary is worth buying
the only Difference is the Bonus Disc with the LOOKING BACK TO THE FUTURE TV special
2-3stars for this new 30th Anniversary Blu-ray, if your not fussy about the 4th Disc
just keep your 25th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of the series",1446854400,9,2497,4.5488888888888885

It's made of metal(which was a nice surprise, i thought it'd be plastic!), and there are spaces where you can attach/screw the plate to a surface.  Just be aware that it's in 'mini' size and is nowhere close to the dimensions of a real license plate.

Still it's a nice and pretty unique extra to have with your BTTF boxset.  The packaging of the blurays themselves is in a normal paper/mediabook style packaging, which can't ever really close(unlike a regular Bluray case or even a steelbook). I'd still recommend this over the limited edition 'flux capacitor' box set.  :)",1446681600,,736,4.848

If you were not happy with the limited edition flux capacitor boxset quality or don't want the 'mediabook' style release of the normal 30th anniv. release, then the steelbook is perfect.

7340800,3,B011Q0FSC2,"This is a very shameful cash grab by Universal, they have not upgraded the picture quality or audio from the 25th Anniversary set, all they have done is repackage the 25th anniversary and add a bonus disc of new content of which half of it is not even in HD but 480i standard definition. They have been very cunning here though, as I was one of the people apprehensive about buying this again. But then I saw they were releasing in digibook packaging and it was at a lower price to the flux capicitor set. Being a fan of digibooks and sucker I was I purchased it as I didn't see review of the set until it was too late. Basically this is not a digibook in the traditional sense i.e a 32 or 64 page book with behind the scenes info but essentially a bunch of cardboard pages where the sleeves of each page act as pocket pouches for holding the discs which you can remove easily. Previous extras are spread across the first 3 discs along with the films, the new bonus disc is a hit and miss affair with 7 new extras of which 3 are 1080p Full HD 1 1080i and the other 2 in 480i SD. They are as follows 2015 message from Doc Brown & new short in 1080p which is basically what he said at the end of the last movie and the new short film is somewhat pointless and boring 2015 commercials 1080p for Jaws 19 & Hoverboard, Outatime: Restoring the Delorean in 1080i which is only 1 of 2 worthy new extras. The other 2 being in 480i SD 2 episodes from the animated show couldn't they just upgraded this? being this is bluray & the 9 part Looking Back to the future from 2009 also SD when it should have been HD also portions of this doc just repeat what was said in previous 6 part doc. It does have nice cover art of all the films on the discs though. Now living in the UK I purchased the UK exclusive collectors tin 25th anniversary which in addition to the blurays had lots of memorabilia like the Grays sports Almanac, Lenticular McFly photo and more which was much better than this set. So I feel like a sucker for buying this again and won't be getting it again which they will probably release when it is 40 or 50 years.

The films look great, and I will wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who does not have the trilogy or are looking to upgrade from a previous format!",1445472000,7,495,4.189473684210526
7340820,5,B011Q0FSC2,"This is the third edition I purchased. The original 3 disk set, the individual releases of the 3 films and this set. I did not buy the 25th anniversary edition because I know that there was going to be a 30th edition-and I further knew that it would come out in October of this year.

THE PACKAGING
One of the complaints in the other reviews is that the packaging is all cardboard and the discs are held in cardboard holder. Really? Then why did my copy come in a flipper disc plastic case? This is the DVD edition I got-not the Blu rays. Did the Blu rays come in a cardboard holder??

SPECIAL FEATURES
Since I don't have the 25th anniversary edition, I don't know what's in that and what's not. Much of the info contained in the interviews is pretty much the same as were the old ones on the other releases. However, it's a treat seeing Christopher Lloyd who was absent in the other DVDs. The 4th disc has all the other features that were on the 3 movie disks before. The 5th disk as I understand is all new.

THE FILMS
I haven't watched the films yet on this release-but if it's as good as the other releases-I'm happy.",1445472000,6,1121,4.278301886792453
7340821,5,B011Q0FSC2,As a huge fan of the Back to the Future movies it is great to have all three movies on Blu Ray and digital HD copies I can stream through my Roku. And to top it off there are a ton of extras and behind the scenes footage that I will be diving into.,1445472000,,248,3.611111111111111
7340822,4,B011Q0FSC2,"The films are terrific but the discs are the SAME as the 25th Anniversary set!!  Not kosher, Universal. I'm enjoying the much improved packaging, but I could have used the money to buy something that was not an almost-duplicate of the previous set.  There IS an interesting blu-ray of extras, some new some not.  Technically, the discs look good (as before, good, not great).  I could not test sound properly last night but I'm sure it, like everything else on the three ""film"" discs, is the same.

7340823,2,B011Q0FSC2,"Love the films, but the all new short ""Doc Brown Saves the World"" would more accurately be called ""Doc Brown says several of the most blase BTTF sentences you could have written."" There is no world saving, and he doesn't even get out of the DeLorean, unlike in the teaser for the trailer...? Certainly not worth buying just for this new work, and that's what I did.",1445385600,4,365,4.462686567164179
