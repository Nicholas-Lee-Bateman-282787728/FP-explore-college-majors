1384992,5,B0000507QZ,This is my all time favorite DVD I own. It shows Corpse at their best putting out the most intense monster energy. It has some of the best tracks on it and it really gets you more into Corpse than before seeing their amazing god like skill. There isn't more I can say other than this is the best DVD i have ever seen.,985219200,3,317,3.96875
1384993,3,B0000507QZ,"What a wonderful DVD this is. Over and hour of live music and short interview clippings as well as two music videos are enough to satisfy even the band's older fans! The great track listing, lifting material from every studio album, also adds a plus to this release. Unfortunately, the sound suffers due to Cannibal Corpse's signature guitar sound (which, you must admit, is not the cleanest) and their recent 6 to 7-string downtuned evolution. The result sounds fine through a PA, but not through your itty-bitty TV speakers. Their stage-presence has also faultered since '92's ""Eats Moscow Alive!"" video, but the band's actual playing ability has vastly improved. The addition 20 or so minutes of sound-checking footage is a really nice touch for the fans, as well.",978480000,6,767,5.0
1384994,5,B0000507QZ,"Cannibal Corpse Rules!!This video really amazed me. This is the first time I actually see the band and I was very impressed with their technical level. I'm a bass player and watching Alex Webster play is incredible, he is just amazing. I think this video is a must have for any cc fan. If you think cc has has a low technical level just wacth them play and you will not beleive the great musicianship these guys have.

1385007,4,B0000507QZ,"Man what an incredible performance from this amazing brutal death metal band !! I'm a casual fan, have listened to some of their records in the past but had never been attracted to them till I saw them live, where they really shine !!
The filming/editing is excellent if a bit dark, but I guess that was the venue so I was OK with that. Aspect ratio 4:3 I'm grateful for since I still own a conventional TV set and love it.

Cons :

 2.0 audio mix is OK by me too, coz I don't like 5.1 except for movies. I also know these kind of bands work with low budgets .But the audio mix has a problem that prevented me from enjoying the gig as much as I could have and that is the fact that the guitar on the left channel is louder than the one on the right. other than that, the mix is fantastic.

The interviews are in between tracks, which is an annoying and outdated practice but can be skipped to the next chapters on which the gig goes on. Actual duration of film footage is 60', but it's not that your ears will be able to take any more, mind you.

Also some key songs like F...d With A Knife are on the cd version only; a marketing strategy to make you buy both or censorship ?!

Bonus are 3 awesome videoclips worth the price alone.",1206576000,,1232,4.070247933884297
1385008,4,B0000507QZ,"The dvd is a straight live death metal show. They show footage of the band before the show, making the viewer feel that these guys are after all only humans, in fact they are your average dudes you meet in a bar or a football game. One thing I personally like about Cannibal Corpse is how they stick to what they do best: good death metal! They are now going through their third wave of new fashions and style and they are starting to stick out like other legendary bands with integrity and style. I've been listening these guys for over ten years now, and I've never been disappointed. Sure they haven't covered any new ground for a while, but then why do you need to, when you have settled on a winning formula? Somebody's gotta make quality death metal, just like Iron Maiden makes quality Heavy Metal, and AC/DC makes quality Arena Rock. Who says death metal, knows that it's gonna be independant and with a limited budget. So yes, the only problem I have with the dvd is the guitars and bass all form one thick wall of sound: I'd have preferred discerning between them just like on their albums. The crowd is not too bad for a death metal show, but they need to be a little more excited about Cannibal Corpse.

So yeah I gave it 4/5 because there are much better live dvds out there, but it goes without saying that this is a must own for the bands' fans.",1127260800,,1360,4.333333333333333
1385009,5,B0000507QZ,"This is the first DVD that I ever bought and I couldn't have chosen anything greater that a Cannibal Corpse DVD. I bought this somewhere in the summer of 2003 along with Envenomed II by Malevolent Creation. When I got along to playing this DVD, like any Cannibal Corpse release, it delivered.

Now before my review, I need to adress some things that are very important. I've already addressed them on my last review for the audio CD version. So I don't have to waste time writting them on this review. So if any one wants to check these important things out, just look at my review for the audio CD. It's on the second pharagraph. Lastly, the version of this Live Cannibalism release that I'm now reviewing is the US version of the DVD.

As for the DVD, the production and filming are more professional than Monolith Of Death. Some of the features here are of course, the Live Cannibalism concert with interviews between some songs. Some of these inveriews feature Alex Webster, Jack Owen and George Fisher. Some of the things that they talk about are their gory album covers, the first 3 albums being banned in countries overseas, George spanding days without taking a shower and the band's devotion to their musical craft. However, there are no interviews with Pat O'Brien or Paul Mazerkiewicz. For those disappointed with that, there are interviews with Pat and Paul and they are on The 15 Year Killing Spree DVD and The Wretched Spawn DVD. For those who want those DVD's, buy The 15 Year Killing Spree boxset and The Wretched Spawn digipack. Now back to the review for this Live Cannibalism DVD. Other features on this DVD are videos for Devoured By Vermin and Sentenced To Burn along with extra footage which features the band rehearsing for the Live Cannibalism show, some backstage footage and the band members meating and talking to their fans before getting on their tour bus and also George wanting to go down the street and get a porno magazine. So this DVD is must for the true Cannibal Corpse fan and like anything and everything that Cannibal Corpse puts out, it will never dissapoint. So buy this DVD and prepare to witness some musical murder and mutilation curtesy of the monsters known as Cannibal Corpse. Enjoy the experience.",1119571200,,2245,4.709923664122138
1385010,4,B0000507QZ,"Cannibal Corpse are one of those bands whose CDs you don't put on when the extended family come around to visit
Admittedly, taken at face value, the fans represented on this DVD make Slayer's fans look like they ought to be at a friggin Tony Bennett concert by comparison!  It makes me grateful to realize how normal I actually am (Stop laughing.)
Anyhow the DVD kicks off with a brilliant performance of STARING THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD and the band steamroll their way through a 16 song set of  songs from their then-current album BLOODTHIRST as well as classics like HAMMER SMASHED FACE, SKULL FULL OF MAGGOTS  & ""a song about shooting blood out of your...."" (Blue-veined custard chucker).  Brilliant entertainment for the kids.  I want Cannibal Corpse to play at my wedding.  It'd be amusing to see my 79 year old grandparents moshing to DEVOURED BY VERMIN. (Or SEVERED HEAD STONING. I nearly busted my gut laughing when I first heard of that song title).
In all seriousness though, this is a great DVD, but you have to watch it a couple of times to really get into it.  What I don't understand is how people seem to knock the Corpse as being untalented musicians. Watching this, you can see what highly skilled musicians the entire band is. Speaking form personal experience I can say, It takes smart people to be stupid. (OK, as I've said I'm not Einstein, but I'm not a cabbage either).  Alex Webster's bass playing is bloody phenomenal! The man is right up there with Les Claypool of Primus and  Sean Yseult, best known for playing in White Zombie (She's hot. I admit I have a soft spot for women with green hair- Sean, will you marry me?).
In a nutshell, this DVD kicks ""donkey"" (ass) ( I seem to have a censorship problem with some of my content, though  I can't for the life of me figure out why).
 The only disappointment  on the DVD is the extras which are just a stupid pre-concert sound check, which will leave you feeling a bit ripped off. On the plus side the uncensored video for the awesome ""Devoured By Vermin""  is on offer, as is the amusing clip for ""Sentenced To Burn"", in which Corpsegrinder looks constipated for the entire video and is on the verge of pooping out Mount Everest. Very funny.  I can just image old Sir Ed Hillary seeing this and saying ""Struth! I'm not bloody climbing THAT! Let the Aussies knock that b*****d off!"". A must-have for any metal DVD collection. I paid NZ $60 for this and (soundcheck aside- how about some nekkid wimmen as bonus content? ) and it was worth every cent. Buy it.
 Finally, I must say I'm looking forward to hearing some of the music from Corpse guitarist Jack Owen's side project, Adrift. It's meant to be more mainstream, but it still oughta rock.",1081987200,4,2721,4.5357873210633946
1385011,5,B0000507QZ,"Aaaarghhhh!! I finally got it! I already had the CD, but I just couldn't resist getting the DVD 'cause I've never had the pleasure of seeing the Corpse live (pun, anyone?). And what a brutal pleasure it is! The sound is very clear for such complex and extreme music. Every instrument is perfectly audible. The only small, tiny gripe I have is with Fisher's stage presence. His vocal delivery is faultless - it is brutal, precise, and passionate. But he mostly just stands there with his left foot propped up on the monitor, and headbangs when he isn't singing. He could maybe move around a bit more, be more expressive. But, hey,maybe he's just into delivering his vocals, and that's fine, because, again, he does do that amazingly well. The videos are awesome, too bad the super crappy mainstream bozos on Mtv don't play them. Very gory and scary. They should bring back the Headbanger's Ball and play this (and other) stuff. The extra footage at the end ain't that great - just your typical soundcheck. I expected drunken manic behavior, not a serious soundcheck and cool, sober chat with some fans. Goes to show how professional they are. They might not shower much, but musically, they are on top of their game and taking care of business. Now, the title of my review alludes to a case. The case is this - People who slag CC saying they can't play have obviously not seen them play. I have played bass for 11 years, and I play Jazz now, but I did play on a Death Metal band in the mid-90's. After watching this, it is painfully obvious that I could not pull off most of these songs, unless I practiced them very slowly for several weeks, and gradually sped them up. That applies only to the non-tapping songs. Alex plays some very complex tapping parts on several of these songs. Because I have never bothered learning to tap, the songs on which he does tap I would need months to master. In short, saying that these guys can't play is just like saying that Aretha Franklin can't sing. It is just plain WRONG!!  Therefore, after watching this, I rest my case. The guys in CC are amazing musicians. I'd rather hear them than show-off ""virtuosos"" like the guys in Dream Theater, who think they are musical gods. Canibal Corpse f--- rules, and they can outplay those posers any day. Period.",1064534400,10,2291,4.574209245742092
1385012,5,B0000507QZ,"This DVD is an excellent example of Cannibal Corpse in their live show. Talented at what they do, they know their music well and they perform it perfectly. Bassist Alex Webster is incredible, and he uses no pick with his bass guitar. Performing some of their old songs, their greatest hits, some new ones and a little footage from each member keeps this DVD interesting to watch. 2 music videos, ""Sentenced To Burn"" and ""Devoured By Vermin"" that are uncensored are on this and about 20+ minutes of footage with the guitarists tuning up and the drummer going at it for a sound check. This DVD is worth buying, especially if you've got surround sound and excellent quality for your DVD player, you'll love it if you love Cannibal Corpse.",1010534400,11,735,4.661538461538462
1385013,5,B0000507QZ,"Cannibal Corpse, the band is crazy enough but after seeing this video you get to see how crazy their fans are too. At one point in this DVD, the guitarist describes a typical Cannibal Corpse fan. 1. Cannibal Corpse t-shirt 2. dirty facial hair 3. hasn't showered in a couple of  days. At another point in the video George Fisher tells us that he has worn the same jeans for the entire U.S. tour and he has gone 12 days without showering before and he doesnt care. Ok...I think you understand how crazy Cannibal Corpse and their fans are. Cannibal Corpse puts on an incredible performance in this DVD and it is great to see all the metalheads out in the crowd moshing to their music. You see people wearing Obituary, Six Feet Under, Slipknot, Immolation, Marduk, Morbid Angel, Deicide, and of course Cannibal Corpse t-shirts and you really get to appreciate metal. The two music videos in this DVD are pretty cool but the shining moment is when Corpse plays ""Hammer Smashed Face"". They play the song perfectly and the crowd goes absolutely nuts moshing as hard as they can. Cannibal Corpse is a great band and after seeing this DVD I definitely want to see Cannibal Corpse live myself. With ""Gore Obsessed"" coming out in February a world tour is sure to take place and I definitely will be checking that out.",1009756800,21,1307,4.585470085470085
1385014,4,B0000507QZ,"live cannibalism is the first cannibal corpse video i have seen, and my initial reaction when i received the video was one of disappointment. i have a copy of the live cannibalism album and the promise of a 'different tracklist' on the video is a rip-off. it simply means that the video has 16 instead of 18 tracks, with the two that are missing ('devoured by vermin' and 'f***ed with a knife') being partricular favouritres of mine. however, it is a marvellous showcase of the bands talents. every member plays brilliantly, and i know this may seem boring to anyone who has read any of the other reviews of the album, but alex webster absolutely shines on the bass. the vocals are super-strong throughout, and anyone who watches the video, even if they are not such a big fan of corpse, will be left in no doubt as to how talented they are. so buy the video if you are into metal at all, but next time leave all the album tracks on the video!",1002844800,2,943,4.394285714285714
1385015,5,B0000507QZ,"Cannibal Corpse deliver live as well as they do on CD!  Having well made DVD footage of them on and off the stage is also a plus.  I heartily recommend this to any C.C. fan out there who is getting into the DVD world, and wants to add a great live performance video to his/her collection.  This is a fun DVD with live 'in your face' music from one of the best ""grindcore/death"" bands in the world today!",993427200,2,403,4.141025641025641

It's a great DVD and a great live album, even though some of my favourite songs came after the fact. Check it out, and don't get fooled by the concert footage on Centuries Of Torment - because THIS is how Cannibal Corpse should be seen on DVD. That being said, if you pick them both up (this for the live experience and that for the great historical documentary on the band) you'll have an awesome CC overdose.",1227225600,,534,4.404040404040404
