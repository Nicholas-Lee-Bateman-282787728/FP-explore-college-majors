8762739,5,B01GE8HOKK,"5-stars for writing; 6-stars for cast. Period set perfection. Character driven drama. Over the series a large character cast is developed well with strong acting. Each has personal drama baggagegood, bad, & ugly. What begins as LOL humor evolves into a chaotic mix of life styles issues, always with magical laugh moments. Careful, you could laugh until you wet your G-string. Not all story-line issues would I condone in real life; but as they are addressed in Brief Encounters comedy/drama fashion the show is original and so well done. FUN.
