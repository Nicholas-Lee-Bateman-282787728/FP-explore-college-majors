8653551,5,B00JRER9R2,informative and very interesting. Great footage of Stravinsky. EVery music lover should have it.,1412035200,,96,5.928571428571429
8653552,5,B00JRER9R2,"Stravinsky may have been a towering genius and the greatest 20th century composer, but he was also an odd duck. The time Stravinsky spent in Hollywood in the 40s, 50s and 60s was considerable, and the artistic journey he took there was profound, in spite of his eccentricities. The stories told by the filmmaker Marco Capalbo in this film present both the music and the personality of a special man in a special place and time.

Some have complained about the re-enactments with actors portraying the Stravinskys and Robert Craft, but I enjoyed the performances enough to forgive the ingenuousness of the presentation. (With the focus on archival film, its not made clear in the DVD/Bluray packaging that these reenactments are part of the project at all. Ive read reviews that talk about home movies, but theres no mention of the actors.) Eric Gorlow, who plays Craft, has a Tony Perkins vibe, which is entirely appropriate for this charming but slightly sinister character. And Giovanni Ombra channels Stravinsky as Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson: bald, smoking cigarettes with a holder, and walking completely self-absorbed a few steps ahead of both Craft and Mrs. Stravinsky.

Stravinskys Hollywood hopes, like so many others (Heitor Villa-Lobos, F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner to name a few) didn't pan out, either in terms of his artistic or his pecuniary dreams. Neither composers nor writers were particularly valued by the system at the time. In one of the most striking sections of the film, Capalbo matches music Stravinsky originally planned with the scenes of classic movies he worked on, including Jane Eyre and The Song of Bernadette. What might have been!

The Bluray of the film looks and sound splendid. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole project.",1410912000,2,1774,5.068493150684931
8653553,3,B00JRER9R2,"There is not enough real archival footage to sustain this documentary -- so actors have been employed for fake re-enactments of Craft and the Stravinskys at their daily activities. I find this ludicrous and a waste of time. The matching of unused music to various films is baffling: nothing seems to follow the rules of film scoring. The narration does not explain this. Did Stravinsky just write something without a scenario in front of him? The whole film is a bit of a let down. Yet I had to own it. Stravinsky fills my shelves of books, CDs, and DVDs and I have to own it all. BTW, this film covers the Craft/Schoenberg influence on Stravinsky rather well. But in-depth analysis is missing. More comments from Craft would have been welcome.",1410825600,,744,4.687022900763359
8653554,2,B00JRER9R2,"I have studied Stravinsky's music and his life for many years.  I found this DVD to be a disappointment for the following reasons:
1) There are many scenes with actors playing these roles: Stravinsky, Mrs. Stravinsky, Robert Craft.  These scenes are made to look old/authentic via digital manipulation: film scratches, faded color, etc.  This fact is not stated in any advertising text. I found this to be misleading, if not deceitful.
2) The actors bear only a slight resemblance to the actual people. The actress Mrs Stravinsky is shorter than the actor Mr. Stravinsky.  In fact, the real Mrs. Stravinsky towered over the composer.
3) Most of the authentic archival footage has been used in previous Stravinsky documentaries.
4) The ""new"" archival footage is quite short.  I estimate under 5 minutes.
5) The sit-down interview with Robert Craft is interesting.
6) I learned nothing new from this documentary, but I am not a typical viewer.

The Stravinsky documentary ""Once At A Border"" by Tony Palmer is far superior and is my recommendation.",1407456000,11,1045,5.046511627906977
8653555,5,B00JRER9R2,"Not too many people even realize that Igor Stravinsky spent his last thirty years or so in Los Angeles - Hollywood to be exact; more than he had We tend to think of Stravinsky as the Russian neo-Romantic; the composer of ""The Firebird"" and ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""Petrouchka""  His emigration  from Russia to Paris to LA was nothing more nor less than a man seeking to escape war, repression and a certain amount of personal loss. What is truly fascinating is what type of music he wrote while living in the brave new world of California. This fascinating documentary by Marco Capalbo shows us the type of person Stravinsky was at that point in his life and also the bold new directions his composition was taking. His post World War II work gave us a very new direction in his writing; including the Concerto in D, his Mass and the opera, Rake's Progress. There were also some dabblings in film scores, including the unused score to the film ""Song of Bernadette"" - the middle movement of which ended up in his ""Symphony in C""  There are many weird, fascinating and nearly unbelievable stories like the creation of that score - and many which ended up just the same, unused by the Hollywood film makers. I found this documentary quite revealing. Here was the best known composer of his time, trying to fit in to his new nearly alien environment and writing music that was never quite what film moguls wanted. There is also an intriguing ""subplot"" of sorts involving another emigre, Arnold Schoenberg whose music found its way into a vast pot-pourri film score for a movie based on Genesis.  The film clips and audio snippets here are helpful and serve as this film's soundtrack. We see that even the vast, open ""dead"" desert provided inspiration for new work based on polyphonies and harmonic systems similar to Webern's and that of Schoenberg. If you have studied Stravinsky and feel you know a lot about his life and work, this wonderful film may challenge that and open new doors. For anyone not that acquainted with Igor Stravinsky it provides a stimulating look at the culture melange that was post-war LA. Hollywood, always a magnet for creative types, may never have been more weirdly interesting. Highly recommended",1406505600,,2224,4.739018087855297
8653556,3,B00JRER9R2,"Stravinsky in Hollywood is a documentary film about Igor Stravinskys years living in California (the place where he lived the longest period of his life), and his unwillingness to change his music to appease Hollywood filmmakers.  Though originally arriving in New York after exiling himself out of World War II Europe, Stravinsky was lured to Hollywood by Walt Disneys request to set The Rite of Spring to animated film for the movie Fantasia.  Through a combination of rare archival footage, scenes from Stravinskys life recreated by actors, and discussion with the composers friend and assistant, Robert Craft, we learn a great deal about how living in Hollywood affected Stravinskys compositional style.  His music was changed, not by the allure of motion pictures, but by the 12-tone technique used by the Second Viennese School composers Schoenberg (a rival in life, but more appreciated by Stravinsky after Schoenbergs death), and Webern (Stravinsky studied his scores in the late 1950s), and by his increasing interest in the Russian Orthodox church.

With a playing time of around 53 minutes, this film is well-made, but could have offered more.  I found the recreated scenes in Stravinskys life distracting and unnecessary.  The archival footage, on the other hand, was very interesting to see.  The Blu-ray picture format is 1080i, so the visuals are clean (including much of the older film footage).  The sound is 2.0 stereo, which is really all that is needed for a documentary that offers only snippets of Stravinskys music.  The only extras are a few trailers to other video titles from C major (the distributor).",1405900800,,1628,5.159695817490494
8653557,4,B00JRER9R2,"I was attracted to this Bluray of the 2014 film by Marco Capalbo  produced for German TV  because I wasn't aware that Igor Stravinsky wrote film scores for Hollywood movies. Not to give any spoilers here (I hate them) but, actually, while he did compose a few scores in the late 1930s and 40s for major studios, they were never used and he stayed in California for 40 years but composed for other than film. As the short (53-minute) documentary states near the  end, he did compose a  piece for CBS TV   The Flood- which was a flop and  which is unavailable on home video.

Near the beginning of the film, we learn that Stravinsky was lured to Hollywood (where, I was surprised to learn, he bought a house (with is mistress of 20 years  soon to be his wife) overlooking the Sunset Strip) by Walt Disney who wanted to make an animated film (later to become Fantasia) and was going to have Stravinsky compose for it. I won't reveal how that turned out  not as you might think! Stravinsky was originally hired to write for some other big budget Hollywood films and  since they were never used in the films but became part of non-film compositions  Capalbo matches the Stravinsky music to the original film (just short scenes) to show what might have been.

There is a good amount of rare footage of Stravinsky at home as well as in the hospital in his final days.  But there is also a lot of time spent on recreations with actors portraying both Stravinsky and his assistant and house guest (for 20 years!), composer, conductor and record producer Robert Craft. Craft  who is now 90  is the sole interviewee in the film and he sheds light on Stravinskys inner thoughts and hope for his music.  Honestly, I thought the recreations (all visual; no recreated dialogue) took way too much time and distracted from the realness of the film. (And the recreations are in wide screen, while the archival footage is in the 4:3 standard screen aspect.

Capalbo wrote, produced, directed and narrates the film. His voice is not the most exciting and reminded me of the narrator of travel films in the 1960s. But that is a subjective opinion.

The BD has no bonus features (and no subtitle option for the hearing impaired). There are three trailers from other videos from the same video company  Major.

If you love classical music  especially by composers like Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg (his contemporary and rival, who gets time here too)  youll want this BD. If you are looking to learn about Hollywood film scoring, Im afraid youll be disappointed.  So the BD gets four stars from me (I learned something yet I found the recreations unnecessary and would have preferred more interviews) but to Stravinsky fans  - like reviewer Michael Britz, whose review was posted before mine it probably would get five stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8653558,5,B00JRER9R2,"This is a very refreshing and unique documentary on famed composer, Igor Stravinsky, and his life in Hollywood, California. The documentary specifically addresses Stravinsky's encounters with the Hollywood film industry and how they solicited his composing powers for film scoring. Lots of never before seen footage is provided along with a new interview with the aged musical assistant of Stravinsky, Mr. Robert Craft (he's 90 now). Stravinsky's music is shown alongside the films that he had originally composed them for, but was never used. I recommend this new documentary for any Stravinsky lover, however, I strongly suggest having a prior background knowledge about Stravinsky as this documentary limits itself to specific instances in his life. I personally have every commercially available Stravinsky documentary that you can imagine; this new documentary provides newer information that was not previously available.",1403568000,3,927,5.72463768115942
