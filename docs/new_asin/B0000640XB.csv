7960335,1,B0000640XB,"There is a serious catalog entry error here and to be to the point, there is an even chance you will not get the right tape.

The product details say ""115"" minutes and rated ""R"" but this is not possible. The 115 minute director's cut version is unrated. The R version is the reduced 113 minute version. So at present, no such VHS tape exists that matches the catalog description, and I don't know which of the two should be considered incorrect to suggest a change.",1428969600,,465,4.406976744186046
7960336,4,B0000640XB,"This is another shock value film but with some soul. The main plot a  hard working successful man loses his wife and seven years later decides he wants to remarry. So he plans this audition with his friend/business partner for a movie he never plans to make. But the audition is really to find a wife. Without giving the film away he comes across Asami a beautiful submissive japenese girl who seems like the perfect mate but is a wolf in sheeps clothing. He  is blinded by love and fails to look into her past or take advice from  business partner. Midway through film she acts and talks bizarre about everlasting love and only love one person in life. At that point its a tell that she's off balance and has been abused in some way by a man in the past. The cinematography & flash backs are creepy. The ending is shocking and total gore. A dark psychological thriller about how far people will go for love and affection & the lasting bitter effect of child abuse. An edge of the seat psychological film , made me think twice about going out on a blind date.",1082937600,3,1059,4.365482233502538
7960337,2,B0000640XB,"I watched this movie based on some of the reviews here that described it as 'powerful' and 'gripping'.  I went into this movie expecting something interesting and let me tell you, I was disappointed.
Several reviewers have said the beginning of this movie is slow and it is.  This, however, is the best part of the movie.  There is some decent character development and the shots of Asami waiting for the phone to ring are chilling.  This is where the two stars come from, because from there the story gets weak as it haphazzardly 'builds' to the gruesome finale.
You are given snippets of information on Asami's past, enough to make you understand why she hates men but not why she's a complete psycho.  Nor is it enough for you to feel bad for her: nothing in her past justifies her actions in any way.  And you're not even sure that any of it is true. Although Aoyama has some faults, he does NOTHING wrong to make you in any way accept what happens to him.  You lose what real connection to the two main characters you may have had and the torture scene seems tacked-on so that they could advertise how sick the movie is, since that is really the only 'interesting' thing this movie can claim.  The end is pretty lame also, worthy of the cheesiest of horror-movies.
I'm thankful I rented this movie instead of buying it.  I would consider watching another of Miike's movies, as the direction was fairly interesting.",1075334400,2,1419,4.55511811023622
7960338,4,B0000640XB,"After watching the popular Japanese horror movie Ring 1 and 2, I really wanted to see if this can be better. Well, the first half of the movie seemed a little slow. If you're the kind of person who prefers something more fast-paced and want to see something really scary or some ""real action"" every 5 - 10 minutes to keep you glued to the screen, well then you'd probably give up on finishing this movie by 20 minutes into the show. But if you're not and you have a bit more patience and you like your mind to be teased (there's nothing funny about this movie though)... well the unexpected awaits.
This is a psychological thriller and, this is especially true for the Western(ised) viewer - you have to be willing to be drawn into the world of the main character (Aoyama) and understand his thoughts and get into his feelings.
Aoyama is a typical high-earning office-working Japanese man in his prime - should I say, late 30s to early 40s. He is very conservative, not stupid... but perhaps a bit naive and overconfident in his view of women. He's not really that smart although sexually-experienced (so it seems, he obviously thinks so.) He hasn't remarried after his wife died 7 years ago. He feels really lonely (and Tokyo can be a lonely place to live in, even if you're Japanese) and wants to look for a new wife. Under the pretext of auditioning for a female lead in a movie, he comes upon a young, intelligent, sensitive, pretty and demure Japanese girl(Asami) who fits his idea of a perfect wife. He starts meeting her up after work, getting to know her better. His friend tells her she's weird, and how her contacts and references on her CV don't really match up, but predictably Aoyama is too blinded by his love with this perfect image of a wife that he refuses to heed his friend's cautions.
Eventually he starts discovering the awful truth about Asami - how mentally-disturbed and twisted her mind was. Whether or not it was purely due to childhood abuse she suffered under her foster parents and stepfather is anyone's guess, because she keeps rattling on throughout the movie about how ""all men are the same"" and how ""they say they'll love you and only you forever but never mean it."" Well if her parents never showed her any affection, its possible she's had at least one experience with a boyfriend who said he loved her but cheated on her feelings in some way to cause her to be so full of hatred. The truth is, I don't know exactly everything that happened to make her feel this way. That is what the movie wants you to do - to keep thinking ""was it"" or ""wasn't it""... ""maybe its this""... or ""maybe its that""...
All in all, this is a good movie if not for its twisted plots mashed into one, its many seemingly incoherent images and subplots weaved together to form some kind of a story that's only for you - the viewer - to make out what these subplots are really all about. You won't come out of this movie feeling good, and you probably won't come out feeling like you've learned something new or something meaningful - well, unless perhaps during the slow-moving first-half of the movie, IF you're attentive enough you can glean a few words of ""wisdom"" from the dialogues Aoyama has with his make friend/colleague about the modern Japanese society and people in general.
The ending is very gory and not for the faint-hearted, and I admit that this sort of ending probably helped the movie make a bigger impact in the minds of the viewers because I can't imagine anyone who can walk away from this and not recall one of those gory or disturbing images from the movie, for at least one day after watching this show! The disturbing and gory images did their job well, although I guess the director *could* have chosen not to use such gory scenes in an otherwise poignant tale about the permanent damage child abuse can have on the abused individual, and Japanese modern society in general - more specifically relating to the class of Japanese people who are blue-collared 9-to-5 desk-bound office-workers.
Like I said, the director *could* have went the other way and perhaps made the ending into a more meaningful conclusion without the violence. The real Japanese people living in Japan today aren't even outwardly agressive most of the time, or at least that's what they don't want to let you-the stranger- see. To me, this movie probably was meant to serve as a mere fantasy outlet for the Japanese people who make up its main audience. Perhaps the Japanese viewers wish that they could be more like Asami, and act out the repressed anger they harbour towards people they resent - and to punish the ones who hurt them or insulted them. Then after the movie, they'll probably return to their normal lives and become the very polite, status quo-abiding people that they have always been known for. (I'm sorry if I sound like I'm lumping Japanese people together. I'm not - there are the few Japanese people who dare to be the ones who do things differently from the rest, who challenge the ""norm"" in Japanese society and live their lives as their dreams and passions take them... but what I've just said I was just referring to the majority who make up the status quo.)",1067990400,,5191,4.588805166846071
7960339,4,B0000640XB,"A lot had already been written about the story of this movie, so I won't repeat any of this. Something in general: Japaneese dramaturgy is working different than ours (West-world). Movies like ""Spiral"" or ""Kairo"" proove that fact: the western culture is too much seeking for explanations which causes many restrictions in different terms. Behind any phenomen there is a ""human motivated"" reason which will - astonishingly - always be found. Most eastern 'mystery movies' are rather showing strange and scary events and possibilites of people's reactions on it. Unexplainable 'things' do not necessarily require human motives - do not have to make sense in terms of complete comprehension. Surely because of their much more spiritual way of thinking that is allowing them to accept unfathomable, abbr. ""in-human"" incidents in life. It seems easier to me for eastern directors to create bizarre art, there seems to be less pressure in making profitable movies by using an experienced/reliable recept.
Audition wants to shock, wants to play with expectations like - in my opinion - real art is doing. What we have here is a version of one extrem shocking contrast. Take a typical thrill-scene: a room. Silence. Immobility. The audience fears: there's gonna be something shocking which is actually happening in the form of a loud sudden noise and a quick movement. Sudden and total contrast... total shock, wheter expected or not...
Audition is doing exactly the same thing, stretched out over 90 minutes: Instead of silence and immobility, there's perfect love, perfect man (with passion/love, unobtrusive/soft/affectionate/caressing), perfect girl (sweet/beautiful/tender/polite/love-replying). The audience fears: it will all fall apart. Everything is perfect here, first erotic/sexual experiences are exactly the way everyone is wishing for.
In a blink of an eye we (the audience) witness that the girl is casting a pitch dark shadow behind her... there's undoubtly an unbelievably confusing secret she's hiding...
The next time the two lovers meet in their still-pink world of increasing passion and love the audience is forced to sense that distracted undertone when watching the two lovers getting on with each other, untill shortly after the climax of their sweet relationship the girl dissapears without a trace, without him having made anything wrong.... After nightmarish experiences including some sort of confusing loss of reality surely caused by that desperate dissapointment of her unexpected dissappearance the audience is being confronted with the most extreme contrast - the total opposite of what we've seen so far.
The ending is comparatively meant to be the same effect as in the above described, classical shock-sequences. Regarding this, the movie is brilliant. Same goes for the actors who are doing an astonishing performance to make you suffer from almost 'too much too perfect love' during their approach - they sort of represent 'such sweet love, it already hurts' (to me). In my case, I'm deeply impressed by the result, even though I usually do not correspond with such representations of tortures, but I do correspond with the basic effect of that ""horror drama"".",1059523200,,3191,5.3585657370517925
7960340,2,B0000640XB,"I suppose that, from a purely artistic/stylistic point of view, I can see why people like this movie, but the one thing that really struck me about ""Audition"" is the amount of graphic brutality and sadistic violence. If you don't mind seeing a movie where people have limbs severed, eyeballs stabbed with long, sharp pins, etc. then, by all means, watch this movie. For myself, however, it was way too much. Way, way too much.
Is it an artistic accomplishment to make the audience so uncomfortable? Perhaps. Certainly the makers of American horror films don't seem able to do it. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was a light-hearted romp compared to ""Audition.""
Personally, however, I wish I hadn't seen it. There's nothing positive or thought-provoking that this movie leaves you with... just a lot of images that will make you squirm uncomfortably as you watch it.",1044144000,2,859,4.972222222222222
7960341,5,B0000640XB,"I just rented Audition a couple days ago, it's still here, and I will probably watch it at least 4 times by the time I have to return it. Then I plan on buying it when I get a DVD player.
Ordinarily I am not even that much into ""thriller"" or ""horror"" types of movies. Seen a bunch, didn't get much out of them. Thus it's not really my preferred genre. After seeing Audition it turns out that the only reason I'm not too into this genre is because none of the other examples are as nightmarishly believable as Audition. Eihi Shiina taps into the vein of evil like no one else I have ever seen.
If I were to sit here and try to think of my favorite movies I rented in 2002 I'd certainly end up forgetting lots of great ones until 5 minutes after I submit my review. Thus I won't do that. But I will indeed say that Audition is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen.
I think the best way I can review and recommend this movie is to say nothing about it. I just don't want to give anything away. I want the viewer to go blindly into this movie, and then walk away afterwards with the feeling of curdled blood clogging their arteries.
My advice: Either go rent this, buy it, or rent it then buy it. Learn as few specifics about it as possible and just pop it into your VCR/DVD player and let it crawl inside you and linger in the regions of human consciousness that are best left dormant.
Now all I have to do is see the other movies by this director and see if Ms. Shiina has made any other movies.",1041206400,,1504,4.0673400673400675
7960342,5,B0000640XB,"Audition is an excellent example of the new wave of cult horror movies. I saw it in the istanbul film festival in 2001. People rushed outside during some scenes, held each other or just closed their eyes. How many films managed to cause such impact on the viewer over the years ? not many I guess.
Story starts in modern Japan where a lonely but successful man decides to get married again after the sad  loss of his wife.
First hour of the film builds around this, making the film a straight drama for many horror film fans. Also in this part we witness the modern Japan and it's culture by the character's thoughts , places they go and people they communicate. The tarnsition periods between old ways and modern Japanese way of living present the clashes in the mind of over 40. But suddenly film becomes a rollercoaster to hell with savage images and nightmarish flasbacks. Miike suceeds doing this with the help of dark yellow colours, sometimes bleached and lighted places and depressing, dark and isolated places. The transformation of an innocent beauty to an unexplainable evil is like a definite slap on the face. The strange characters, realistic and sick torture scenes and endless evil flashbacks makes this movie a classic underground horror movie. Miike also never made such a movie before despite all the bizzare movies under his file.
I personally believe that this movie is influenced by the works of the illustrator Toshio Saeki. Saeki is the Japanese master of bizzare and crazy as well as sick illustrations and cartoons. Especially the hot iron between young girl's legs bit is nicked by an illustration by him If my mind is not tricking me. I also believe that If Saeki wanted to shoot a movie, this would be nothing less than the audition.
If you have the stomach and nerves as well as patience for the first half ( I loved that part too it) please go and see this movie.  Im sure many gentelman will be very cautious and paranoid with ladies after watching this movie.
There is only a few examples of such greatness in the genre.
A horror masterpiece by Miike.",1018224000,5,2084,4.6603260869565215
