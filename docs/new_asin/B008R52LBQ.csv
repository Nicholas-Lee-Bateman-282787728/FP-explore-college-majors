8529864,3,B008R52LBQ,"It's a real stretch referring to most of these films as cult classics. What you get in this combo set is a selection of older films that seem to be included in every cheap combo set on the market. Films like the 1960s Little Shop of Horrors, Night of the Living Dead, Carnival of Souls and the Vincent Price version of House on Haunted Hill. If you enjoy films like this (I certainly do) then by all means, grab a copy of this collection. But if you already have a dozen copies of these films as part of other movie sets you may want to give it a pass.",1519776000,,552,4.073394495412844
