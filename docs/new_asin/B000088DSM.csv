1828989,2,B000088DSM,"I purchased the Living Seas collection which was very nice. so I thought this series would be equally well done. what an unpleasant surprise!!! I am appalled at the blatant evolutionism that is being crammed down your throat during the entire program. I don't share the evolution view and don't appreciate Mr Attenborough, or anyone for that matter, trying to indoctrinate my children with this view which is expressed during the entire program (all 4 CD's) I expected a well narrated and documented account of the animal world. Instead I got what seemed like a hastily put together series -which I gues was built upon the success of the previous series- wherein Mr. Attenborough hopps to differrent parts of the world trying to explain how natural evolution really is despite the fact that quite the contrary is true; The big bang theory isn't true, we did not happen by accident, we didn't evolve from monkeys over millions of years, etc. I am sorely dissapointed by the NARRATOR now taking the center of the stage and appearing on screen in the middle of each section, he is no longer the NARRATOR, he is now the ""star"". Had I wanted that I would have looked for the movie: ""David Attenborough, a lesson in indoctrination"".
I would NOT recommend this series, If you watch the animal channel you've probably already see all what this series has to offer, except if you're looking for a lesson (read lie) in evolution.",1063843200,23,1419,4.772357723577236
1828990,4,B000088DSM,"I will not shirk Attenborough's knighthood.  He certainly deserves the title, probably far more than a plenty of others.  I can't pick a series of his that I haven't enjoyed, but having now watched this series through a couple times, I'm struck with a sense that I've seen all this before.
And, well, maybe I have.  Back in seventies, Attenborough and his team were given apparently limitless funds and some seven years or so to make the most amazing nature documentary possible--and they did.  Life on Earth redefined the scope of what you could do with with a science program.  It was something like the Citizen Kane of nature shows, covering the evolution of life on earth (all 3.5 billion years!)
The only problem is what do you do for an encore...well, you do The Living Planet, Trials of Live, The Life of Birds, Life in the Freezer, Secret Life of Plants, etc. etc.  And of course, The Life of Mammals.  And not a one was I dissapointed with (though there are two I haven't seen yet), yet everyone felt a little lesser than the original 'Life on Earth'.  At least with 'Life of Plants' he's mostly covering new material (and hence this is one of his stronger outings, but with Mammals, we have what is more or less a rehash of material already covered extensively in Life On Earth and Trials of Life (and probably Living Planet, but I haven't seen this one yet.)
That isn't necessarily a bad thing since Sir Attenborough has all new equipment this time round, a gorgeous soundtrack and as always a top notch crew that is both talented and dedicated in their filming of animals from all over the world.  The question however is if the new footage justifies a new series.  And...well...I'm not really sure.  I love owning these DVDs and I really enjoy watching them.  They are extensively entertaining while in truth not really breaking any ground that David Attenborough didn't first break himself back in 1979.
My final take is that if you haven't seen the older series, this is DEFINITELY worth it.  It's absolutely a work of quality and we're lucky to get DVDs of these BBC releases.  For fans of Attenborough's work however, this becomes a different matter.  Side by side with 'life on earth', 'Mammals' feels rather vacant but still enjoyable.",1063843200,101,2254,4.685279187817259
1828991,5,B000088DSM,"What an amazing piece of documentary! BBC has done it again - present a nature series that is superlative.
With  10 episodes meticulously arranged and edited so that even your youngest can understand the life of mammals from their evolution, until modern man, this series, in my opinion stands alongwith the Blue Planet and the Life of Birds - right on top!
The narration is, as usual, at its best; David Attenborrough, almost comically, turns up in the most unlikely of places. The passion for that man is amazing and often, inspiring.
The best part of the series, is their progression. It starts with a feeling of awe, about animal behaviour and leaves you with a deep sense of introspection, wondering what a single species of mammals, us, has done to so many other species around the world.",1053820800,16,794,4.753623188405797
1828992,5,B000088DSM,"The Life of Mammals is a stunning work of incredible range and scope, taking us from the frozen wastes of the arctic to searing deserts to lush rain forests. The film highlights the range of behaviors among mammals, illustrating the remarkable ways in which they have solved the problems created by the escalating evolutionary battle for food, for a mate, for a place to live. Some of the more wonderful images include bats delicately plucking spiders from their webs, elephants trooping into an African cave in the middle of the night, and remarkable predatory dramas on the savannah.
As with all David Attenborough films, this one is dense with interesting facts. Each segment provides new insights into the behavior of animals, even for such prosaic beasts as wildebeasts and gazelles. The Life of Mammals appears to me different from Attenborough's previous works in its aggressive use of novel camera techniques, which is very successful, taking us for instance inside the egg of a platypus.
This film also combines the superb visuals with a brilliant score. The music, which is at times mournful, at times crackling with tension, and at times positively soaring, adds an inspiring sense of drama. This is justified not only by the subject matter, which is indeed sublime, but by David Attenborough himself, who as far as I am concerned is an absolutely unparalleled genius.
If I haven't yet sold you, consider the price of this work, which at $... constitutes remarkable value for the 500 minutes you get. Just a year or so ago, The Trials of Life series on VHS (which is of comparable length, but without the whistles and bells that this DVD gives you) cost $...",1053648000,14,1669,4.901060070671378
1828993,3,B000088DSM,"David Attenborough's Latest Series - The Life of Mammals.
As you probably know, this is the current BBC Television Series hosted by David Attenborough.
It is very interesting to me that its broadcast airing is on Discovery, rather than PBS, but that's the way the world is going these days.  Cash before class.
I tried to watch a couple of the episodes on television, but the commercial breaks and the way that Discovery constantly promotes itself drive me crazy.  I was reminded again why I never watch it.  Not that I watch PBS much anymore either!  Especially since they stopped airing ""Wild America""!
So, I bought the set on DVD ...  Pretty amazing changes underway in video sales also.  Shopping online and 10 One-hours Specials at [price]each.  Ouch.  Tough competition, when the Brits pay for producing them with government money and then practically give them away in retail.
Anyway, here's the report.  The Series is certainly watchable, especially compared to The Osbournes and Mr. Personality.  It is worldwide in scope, obviously, and fairly equally divided between the continents.  Call me a provincial snob, but Australian wildlife never has excited me much and, with a few rare exceptions from Alan Root and David Hughes, the films on African wildlife are always about Lions and Elephants.  Yawn.  Which is much of what they show here.  And, Monkeys...  My oh my, does the BBC love them Monkeys!  I guess that my favorite subject matter is American wildlife... imagine that.
They went out of their way to include two-shots of David with as many animals as possible.  So, he feeds Flying Squirrels, pets Manatees, lets Meerkats sit on his shoulder and Chimps hop on his lap, floats with Sea Otters, etc. etc. etc.  It became so repetitious that I almost expected him to leap on the back of something and ride off into the sunset. Which is to say that he is as passionate and animated as ever.  Bless his little ol' pea-pickin' heart.
I guess that people love it, but since it did not show all the weeks and months of behind-the-scenes work of production assistants and biologists which obviously went into lining up those shots to stick him in, it presented a very distorted view of a human in nature.  Hey, I still love Davey boy to pieces.  It was just too obviously contrived.
He also played with a lot of gizmos, especially the cool little Sony DVCAM portable monitors... over and over.  And they tried to break other new ground, so they had many sequences filmed at night with InfraRed cameras, their Toy du Jour.  These sequences appeared in black-and-white and didn't feel at all like night since they were so brightly lit.  Like the Joubert Lions-in-the-Spotlight (literally), films, they didn't paint with the light, they blasted with it.  Lions hunting and various animals eating Termites... Anteaters, Sloth Bears, Gorillas, etc. etc.  My oh my, do those Brits love them Termites.  One of their most hyped sequences was Possums, Skunks (they didn't even identify them as rare Hog-nosed Skunks, just called them plain ol' Skunks) and Raccoons eating baby Bats on the worm-infested floor of a Bat cave.  Nasty.
Some amazing sequences of Chimps eating Monkeys, Right Whales mating, and Shrews playing Follow-the-leader.  (we never did get that shot!). It concludes with an interesting comparison of Orangutans and Chimps to humans and then a very heavy-handed comparison of the collapse of the Mayan empire with our modern over-built, over-populated world.  Uh huh. ...  And we did it all to ourselves. So, what else is new?
It did not make me want to rush out and buy an InfraRed camera, but it did make me want to film some more American wildlife!",1053475200,13,3671,4.872580645161291

What does that tell you about insects alone? I love mammals, but we need to cut it out with the mammal bias. They aren't the greatest group of all time. No group is, besides Aphantobionta as a whole, which literally includes everything that has ever lived.

The deepest mystery: why do tree-living sloths insist on defecate on the ground, where they are easy pray? Unintelligent design, anyone? As usual, Attenborough inserts himself into the action, at one point trailing a Siberian tiger. For once, he's cheating - the tiger lives behind a fence, and I don't blame David for not getting inside the fenced area!

1829033,5,B000088DSM,"All the sublime things this planet has to unfold...

Let me talk about the main differences between this DVD series and let's say the more famous ones like Planet Earth or Life to be a bit more informative about this particular product:

The Life of Mammals is not as epic as let's say Planet Earth in its scope. it feels a bit more intimate and particular. Planet Earth and life are both filled with exquisitely breathtaking visuals that were created with elegance, patience and dedication. The Life of Mammals is a bit 'smaller' in its approach, and feels a bit more casual, if you will. First of all, this series is all about mammals. The very unique ones: fascinating bats, small rodent type creatures, monkeys, apes and other highly exotic creatures that you may or may not have known or heard of before. They are all outstanding animals, and some are unique because of their social habits, some because of the way they look or hunt, or some just because they are flat-out odd, even if they all happen to be mammals... like us humans. You get to see David Attenborough in every one of the 10 episodes, but not constantly. He is highly likable, genuine and affable. This is also a main difference between this particular collection and Planet Earth, Blue Planet and Life: you have direct communication with the master himself. He travels, interacts with animals to a certain degree and looks directly into the camera. His warm presence is quite endearing.

Because of the prevalent human touch and imagery, you never get totally lost in wildlife here. You are in this journey to enjoy it, learn from it, get an education and observe. However, you do not get to 'live ' it, pretending that you yourself an animal, or some Greek God who can see all of nature with your divine eyes. The human touch here is not just some all-knowing voiceover, but it is in fact the master himself in the frame.

Attenborough unleashes a paradise before you... so many animals, so many compelling details. The beauty of all these creatures is unmatched. They are all just gorgeous to look at. You have the highly charismatic and handsome big cats and wild dogs, but also cute squirrels, rodents, the pouched mammals of Australia and many other mammals that can often times be called 'extreme' due to what they can do, accomplish and how their bodies are designed by nature. Mammals that can lay eggs, that can feed under water, that can fly, that can live with humans... So much detailed info about these lives that have existed unchanged for MILLIONS OF YEARS in some cases believe it or not, but the documentary's take or tone about the subject at hand is never boring or tedious. Each episode is 50-54 minutes long and feature epic hunts, adorable social interaction footage between the species that live in herds, groups, prides or packs; there is some sex, some violence, some play and even a few really unique birthing scenes. The birth of kangaroos is particularly mind-boggling.

I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoy the priceless and prominent work Attenborough has given us. I loved the fact that its approach was somewhat different than the other aforementioned collections, since this one has a particularly unique voice it turns out. You can also see how respectful the filmmakers were toward their subjects and how kindly they handled these fragile creatures and their pristine habitats.

Utterly remarkable in every way.

PS: I would recommend the very religious folk to skip the final episode here. It deals with apes and monkeys and how similar they are to humans, which can easily shatter someone's deeply rooted religious beliefs. Seeing how unapologetically similar they actually are to us is simply staggering, and I know it is disconcerting for some of us to be exposed to the hardcore evidence of evolution and genetic similarity in such a straightforward and blatant fashion. The filmmakers are not pushy in regards to force-feeding something down anyone's throat about evolution and do not in any way make any sort of a merciless proclamation. But the footage speaks for itself.",1313107200,2,4100,4.840228245363766
1829034,5,B000088DSM,"What can I say? My husband, myself, and our 5-year-old are fans of David Attenborough's nature documentaries and ""The Life of Mammals"" is one of our favorites. Intrepid naturalist Sir David Attenborough hosts this series and this is one series where he features prominently in the actual shots - be it narrating in the foreground as an anteater devours a termite mound, sitting happily amidst a colony of feeding bats, passing humorous commentaries as in the scene of mating hedgehogs, his presence makes for an enlightening and entertaining viewing experience.

This particular series focuses on mammals, one of the most diverse population on Earth - from the tiniest mammal to the largest and most advanced, they are all portrayed here in all their beauty and natural glory. All aspects of how mammals live and feed are explored - it was interesting to see how certain bats fed up high, and others foraged on the ground, for example. Watching how some mammals lived in the most inhospitable surroundings was also illuminating.

There is some amazing and unique footage on these discs, such as the Chimpanzees hunting monkeys in Kibale Forest, Uganda. I'll never forget the image of the Chimps chasing the poor monkey, or the sound of their hunting cry. I was amazing at the size of blue whales and humpback whales (as well as the size of the male genitals of the former!). I also found the last disc on humans interesting, since it demonstrates how ancient humans hunted antelope on foot.

The DVD series is well organized, beginning with marsupials and with each disc covering a different class of animal. In fact, it almost seems like a natural progression as each disc points out new adaptations that allowed that particular mammal species to survive.

1829040,4,B000088DSM,"Planet earth and the blue planet by far are the best I had seen from the BBC series.  There are a bit too much of David Attenborough in the DVD in this series.  It is good to see how much trouble David ATtenborough went through in the attempt of making these DVD, but after a while, you sort of feel tire of seeing the same person over and over again.  The information provided in the DVD is vast and incredible!  There are mammals that I did not dream of their existence at all.  In the very beginning of the first DVD about the white fox in the Artic, it already made one the famous Chinese romance writer's story rediculous due to the geogrphy location of white fox is only in the very cold environment.  It is definitly an eyes opening experience to watch the DVD.  However, don't know whether it is Mr. Attenborough's voice or what, the DVDs were not able to hold me in front of the TV to watch more of it. I like watching discovery channels on the animals very mcuh.  Teachers, if you are going to show this in class, please put in the consideration that your poor students might fall into sleep.  This is probably best to be shown in smaller sections which related to the class than the whole things.  My suggestion will be taking smaller intervals to watch these DVD.  These are pobably more value as the outside assignment for college class.",1243036800,4,1350,4.381526104417671
1829041,5,B000088DSM,"This is the 7th entry in the David Attenborough Life series following The Life of Birds. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life was 12 episodes long and all about animal behaviour. Life in the freezer was 6 episodes long and specialized on the Antarctic. The Private life of Plants was another 6 episode series and focused entirely on botany. The Life of Birds was 10 episodes long and is one of the best documentaries about birds ever made.

With Life in the Freezer and The Private Life of Plants Attenborough made a new move to specialize instead of following the 12-13 episode discipline that started with Clark's Civilisations and Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and birthed other great series like Sagan's Cosmos. Attenborough, after deciding to detach from the shorter episode format of Freezer and Plants (an such as was in previous non-life series such as The Tribal Eye, The First Eden and Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives) and after going for a higher number of 10 episodes instead of 6 for a specialized theme on birds, goes for mammals for what will be the last of his longer running shows in the Life series as he would afterwards cut back considerably for the remaining ones.

Apart from the extremes of Life in the Freezer, Mammals maybe his most dangerous production. Skunks spray. Grizzly bears are hungry. Big cats are filmed in close-up hunting, not to mention that Attenborough does all this at 76 years of age. The series requires that they fly to and visit multiple places around the world.  Because mammals are warm-blooded the producers make full use of the latest night vision and heat sensitive technology.  Attenborough looks at why mammals have evolved and why the mammalian design works. He covers insect hunting mammals and plant predators, herbivores, before turning to rodents and how they chisel their food. Then we get carnivores meat eating and the opportunistic feeders that take advantage to also eat plants, the omnivores. Mammals have also evolved to return back to the water so a large part of the series is marine based. Then we turn to the trees for the final few episodes concentrating on primates and their social structures before finally veering to man with special emphases on the extinction of other civilisations and why we must conserve the diversity of life.

Overall this is some of the best of Attenborough's incredible life series. Some of the most memorable scenes are whale mating and the indigenous bushmen of the Kalahari Desert going on a long endurance hunt, not to mention the sheer scope of the social behaviour of primates that is investigated. This is an utterly fantastic and unbeatable view of mammals. Attenborough does it yet again.",1237852800,14,3050,4.903100775193798
1829042,5,B000088DSM,"As somebody who loved Planet Earth and The Blue Planet, I would definitely place this 10 part series close to the level of quality that those two achieved. Of course, this isn't going to be in HD, but it still looked pretty impressive on my 60 inch DLP TV. Unless you sit two feet from the screen, you are not going to notice any problems with picture quality.

What sets this series apart from Blue Planet and Planet Earth is creator David Attenborough's direct involvement with the source material. Almost every episode opens and closes with Sir David standing face to face with an animal to featured in the episode. You get a true appreciation of Grizzly Bear salmon hunts when the host is literally standing 10 feet away and narrating as it is occurring. Some casual fans of Planet Earth may not like this, as it grounds the documentary and prevents it from reaching the near art-based quality of some of the BBC's more recent productions. Personally, I love seeing how excited Sir David gets when he finally sees a Blue Whale, or as he explains how monkeys react to leopard decoys he places in the African rain forest. Although I would highly recommend all of his ""Life of"" DVDs, the massive variety of animals featured in this set will likely be appreciated by all.",1233619200,51,1271,4.623893805309734

I have watched every episode in this series about fifteen times each (ok, yes, perhaps I've gone overboard).  Even so, I still learn something every time I watch.

This series stands out among the others because it achieves the highest quality in every aspect.  Photography is beautiful throughout.  The music, when used, is nice and never excessive or obtrusive.  The narrative is excellent, providing interesting information without too many words, so the viewer can absorb it easily and keep his attention on the visuals, too.  A little harder to explain, but equally important, is the way the series is organized, both at the level of each episode's subject, as well as within each episode.  From the opening scene of episode one to the closing scene of the final episode, there's never a break or misstep, just a wonderfully entertaining, informative, and compelling flow from one subject to the next.

1829056,4,B000088DSM,The information and visuals presented in Attenborough's series are nothing short of amazing.  Very interesting tidbits and interesting camera setups such as one inside a beaver's dam and one inside a kangaroo's pouch.  My only problem with this series was that at times Attenborough interferes too much with the mammals making the documentary lose it's natural feel.  For example Attenborough overfeeds an animal to make it's cheeks stuff for the camera and at another time he touches a baby seal in its den.  These portions distract from the otherwise beautiful and engaging look at mammals.,1183420800,,592,5.2
1829057,5,B000088DSM,"David Attenborough's ""The Life of Mammals"" contains 500 minutes of top-notch footage on 4 discs. This series is beautifully filmed and as entertaining as any documentary in the past, although Attenborough's 1979 series ""Life on Earth"" was a phenomenon at the time.

""The Life of Mammals"" ten episodes cover the full range of the mammal class; beginning with montremes and marsupials in the first episode and then moving on to the placentals from episode 2. Each 48 minute episode depicts (roughly) ten different species.

Episode 1: A Winning Design - monotremes and marsupials
Episode 2: Insect Hunters - moles, bats, anteaters
Episode 3: Plant Predators - various herbivores, especially antelopes
Episode 4: Chisellers - rodents and squirrels
Episode 5: Meat Eaters - big cats and dogs, pack and solitary hunters
Episode 6: Opportunists - omnivores like bears and racoons
Episode 7: Return to Water - whales, seals and dolphins
Episode 8: Life in the Trees - monkeys
Episode 9: Social Climbers - monkeys and babboons
Episode 10: Food for Thought - apes and humans

What impresses me is the style of film-making. In each episode, Attenborough doesn't just pick a number of mammals and tell you about them; he has a certain sequence based on a theme which builds from mammal to mammal. That is, he will raise a question based on one situation and then answer it with the next mammal, thus tying a thread together for that episode. An example from Episode 3 (Plant Predators) is the focus on the food sources on the plains of Africa. Here, Attenborough discusses the adaptations of the grasses which enable them to survive, but then talks about the dangers for these plants; which are not animals, but the acacia tree. He now makes us think the thorn-ridden acacia tree will take over the world - Attenborough has the viewer in the palm of his hand. He goes on to describe the adaptations a small antelope has in order to eat the bottom leaves, then the adaptations of a bigger antelope that eats the middles branches, then the girafe that eats the top branches, then the elephant who knocks the whole tree down. It's this clever ordering or sequencing that has the viewer spell-bound. He could've just shown the animal's source of food; but instead there is a level of intrigue not found in other documentaries.

I'm a high school science teacher and a Christian. Nature documentaries generally over-use the theory of evolution and I'm glad to note that this is not a focus in ""The Life of Mammals"" as much of Attenborough's discussion is refreshingly 'design' based. He is not proposing a Creationist viewpoint, and conversely, is not overwhelming the viewer with evolutionary ideas. Instead, Attenborough's focus is on the adaptations mammals have in order to survive in their environments.

Despite nothing original in the carnivores episode (its all been done before by others), this is a masterpiece. It is beautifully filmed and cleverly written by the Shakespeare of the genre. It holds both the young and old captive but also those not overly excited with nature documentaries. And despite what another reviewer wrote there are observations that have never been seen before let alone captured on film.",1182988800,3,3209,4.968342644320298

The footage is incredible, even with animals, settings, and behavior you may have seen many times before. The series captures it so well; there may be things you hadn't caught before. Elephants scratching salt out of caves, snakes hunting bats on cave walls, and a Yapok taking a swim (with her babies in a water-tight pouch!) all at night, and many other scenes are captured with crystal clear infrared cameras.

Also, there are some first-time scenes in these programs. One for example, is David inserting a camera-tube down a Platypus burrow, and filming a baby (it's practically still a fetus) with its mother. And, like always David's narration is spot-on.

The DVD is also of very high quality. The picture is very sharp and has absolutely no grain, or fuzziness. The sound is also clear of crackles or popping. There are some very nice features as well, including;

- Behind the Scenes Featurettes (gives you a great look at how some of  the complex shots were made)

- Fact Files (quite long, but very interesting additional information on  lots of mammals from the series)

- Photo Gallery (high quality stills, some are straight from the series and some aren't)

To the delight of the open-minded, it is possible to enjoy a belief in both creationism and evolutionary theory.  In short, if it is believed that God is all knowing and people are not, then the idea that the animial world has been given the ability to evolve as part of such a perfect design should not be so quickly dismissed.  Why would one feel it neccessary to discredit the divine ability to factor in the processes of evolution into the beautiful design of all living creatures?

And for those who may not believe in a divine being, is there really no feeling of some inner sensation that you simple can't explain when trying to fathom the remarkable diversity of the world around you, let alone your own existance?

If only more people were as insightful as David Attenborough, not so much time would be used on judging and disregaurding the use of such a unique capacity to learn and understand the natural world around us.

Kids and grownups alike would love the visuals and knowledge and some deeper thought would reveal how intricate the web of life on this planet is and how threatened it is.

From deer like rodents in Patagonia whose activities seem to confuse a nearby burrowing owl (whose burrow the Maras had snatched) to a female Leopard sneaking into a rural village in India to steal domestic goats because its natural prey base was scarce. From bizarre (platypus), to large (whales), tiny (harvest mice), blind (golden mole), fast (cheetah), slow (sloth), to the ones that fly (bats) - this dvd covers the entire spectrum of mammals in stunning visuals and captivating narration.

David Attenborough is thorough and scientifically accurate. His screen presence is comforting and his lifetime of experience ensures that the content is seamless and exciting. I highly recommend this series for anyone.",1130716800,16,1072,5.0508474576271185

1829077,5,B000088DSM,"I just got The Life of Mammals today. I Just love the graphics and the special features it has. David Attenborough is at his best in the set. If you love animals you will enjoy watching this, and your family will too. This is one of the best DVD set I own today.",1118361600,4,262,3.9622641509433962
1829078,5,B000088DSM,"This was the best DVD set I own right now.  I also own the Life of Birds, Wildlife on the Prowl, among countless others.  Not to say that those two aren't good, but this one is GOOD>",1112400000,4,182,3.891891891891892
1829079,5,B000088DSM,"What a wonderful, fascinating, captivating work of art this is, and also of obvious and overflowing love and respect for nature. Sir David Attenborough educates and engages, and does so with passion and his vast knowledge of the subject matter, knowledge he shares happily and enthusiastically. I got these DVDs as a present from my best friends, and it is a present that now I would like to give to all those I care about most. I believe no other comparable series has ever been created (except perhaps for Attenborough's own earlier work). This is indeed an exceptional, outstanding documentary of nature.",1112140800,5,607,4.96078431372549
1829080,5,B000088DSM,"Let's get three things straight:
It's Sir David, not Sir Attenborough;
the BBC does not receive a government subsidy, it is funded by the viewers, the Post Office merely collects the money for it;
in Britain, Creationists are regarded as the lunatic fringe.
If you bear this in mind, Attenborough's achievement can be better understood. Most of the filming is done by a team from the BBC's Natural History Unit.",1105228800,14,411,4.885714285714286
1829081,5,B000088DSM,"This was a great piece of animal cinematograhpy. It shows how things really came to be. The big bang is true and yes we evolved from ancestral primates. If you hide your kids from evolution they will be made fun of and harassed for being so old fashion and closed minded. Attenborough was not trying to stuff evolution down your throat, but rather tell the really story of how mammals and ourselves came to be. Anyone who enjoys nature will like this program. If you are really into church and don't believe the true origins of life then this title is not for you.",1104364800,8,564,4.4326923076923075
1829082,5,B000088DSM,"It's too bad that many people are too closed minded to realize that evolution is not something you can believe in, but something that happened/happens.  Saying you don't ""believe"" in the color yellow doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  This documentary helps show the microcosm of evolution...the amazing way many animals developed to live in their environments.  It is excellent.",1100649600,14,376,5.338983050847458
1829083,5,B000088DSM,"Mammals is another must see from David Attenborough. These DVD's are simply amazing. The photography they shoot in these is just incredible. David Attenborough has the perfect voice to commentate. I love every aspect of these and I watch them over and over again.

If these were just music and the films they shot it would still be amazing without all the fun, exciting, and interesting things you learn. It is that beautiful. There is something about these DVD's that is so relaxing, I just love to turn them on and lay down and nap to the relaxing background music and David talking me to sleep.

This is a DVD set that will rarely leave your player, it is the fruits of a lot of hard work by the crew. Buy it and enjoy it to the fullest.

I also strongly recommend Blue Planet in addition to the Mammals DVD's, buy them both, sit back, relax, learn, and enjoy. David Attenborough does very good work and I highly recommend all of his documentary work.

Good stuff.",1097712000,12,967,4.4772727272727275
1829084,5,B000088DSM,"Hands down this is one of the best nature documentary series I've ever seen.  My jaw was on my lap for many scenes and I found myself laughing loudly, getting chills, yelling at the screen, and clapping when the prey escaped (or sometimes when the predator won).  There is tons of footage using the latest infrared technologies which enable us to witness night action that we could rarely otherwise see.  The marine mammal episode was utterly astounding, as were the beginning and ending episodes both introducing the topic of mammals and showing us our primate kin in its fascinating variety.  My personal taste would have preferred more framing the action within an evolutionary narrative, but I suppose for a large TV. audience these things are usually ""softened"" to remain as uncontroversial as possible.  But now if I ever get the chance to choose, I'll come back in another life as a flying squirrel!",1095292800,8,906,4.895424836601308
1829085,4,B000088DSM,"In my home, we're all big fans of nature documentaries, Discovery Channel, National Geographic, etc.  We bought The Life of Mammals sight unseen after having enjoyed the entire Blue Planet series.  My two year old loved Blue Planet so much that, while I hate to admit it, my wife and I were looking for something else for him to watch.  By looking at Amazon's ""customers who bought this also bought"" area on Blue Planet, we've since acquired other BBC documentaries for the kids to watch - The Life of Birds and Walking with Dinosaurs.
The Life of Mammals is a series of episodes, similar to Blue Planet.  However, I will say that the footage, while excellent, is not nearly as spectacular as I found Blue Planet to be.  I think that's the only reason The Life of Mammals gets 4 stars from me and not 5.  Our son loves it just as much, so who am I to complain?
The episodes in this series are as follows:
A WINNING DESIGN - sort of an overview on mammals, their variety and why they thrive; features echidna, platypus (a favorite of our little boy), possum, kangaroos, and yapoks.
INSECT HUNTERS - features some unbelievable aerial footage of bats catching bugs; the anteater and pangolin are also excellent.
PLANT PREDATORS - our son's favorite episode largely due to giraffes and elephants; the picas and bison are also favorites, as well as a sequence about how African plant eaters deal with predators that consists mostly of running
CHISELLERS - mostly deals with rodents and other...well...vermin, including beavers, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, marmots, etc.
MEAT EATERS - another favorite of my sons, mostly because of the lions and other cats - we were concerned that some of the predation scenes might be a little bloody for him, but that wasn't the case at all; the tiger footage is spectacular
OPPORTUNISTS - can't say I enjoyed this one that much, as it features a lot of animals I consider to be pests; I will say that it gave me new insights into racoons and the rat scenes were incredible (although disgusting)
RETURN TO THE WATER - featuring sea otters, seals, dolphins and whales, this episode is most similar in footage to Blue Planet
LIFE IN THE TREES - deals with the tree canopy as a distinct ecosystem, requiring specific skills to survive; features meercats, sun bears (the best climbing bear), fruit bats, loris, lemurs and gibbons
SOCIAL CLIMBERS - largely about primates, and how monkeys and apes have complex social structures; features uakaris, tamarin, guenons, macaques, and geladas.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT - I hate to say it, but I think this is my least favorite episode because it seems to deal as much with people as it does with mammals.  It is interesting, but I can't say that it has the same replay value as the rest of the series, particularly for our son.
Throughout the series, David Attenborough is his stately, understated self.  Unlike in Blue Planet, where he simply narrates, Attenborough makes appearances in this series.  He's so scientific that sometimes, it's kind of funny - like when he narrates hedgehogs trying to mate in his back yard.  Anyway, we found this entire series to be thoroughly enjoyable, educational and a treat for our son as well.",1087862400,40,3198,4.766726943942134
1829086,5,B000088DSM,"I have not yet watched Attenborough's other series, but the 9th movie in this series (_The Social Climbers_) was so outstanding it made me beg for the others.  I was not disappointed, although _The Social Climbers_ (monkeys) is my favorite.  _The Insect Hunters_  (insectivores) and _Chisellers_ (rodents) are almost as good.  All the episodes are densely packed with wonderful information and footage.  Since Attenborough's strength is pointing out the wonders of the ordinary and overlooked, he is at his best when filming small animals.  (When filming large animals, he is too preoccupied with their size.)  I also liked that the series revealed the filming technologies without becoming too overwhelmed with them, except in the leopard scene of _Meat Eaters_.
There is at least one glaring inaccuracy, in _Meat Eaters_: Hyenas are NOT dogs.  They are in their own family, which is more closely related to the cat and mongoose families.  Fortunately this is correct in the book.  Overall, I highly recommend _The Life of Mammals._",1086307200,3,1033,5.206060606060606
1829087,4,B000088DSM,"Charming, enduring, creative, pretty good for a goverment susidized publication.  What everyone says about Sir Attenborough is true, he is great to watch and listen to, his presenatations have a way of sucking you in, making you feel apart every moment. Beyond Attenborough's inviting personality there are a plethora genuinely fascinating moments that were achieved thourgh the use of cunning and cutting edge photography. What's really neat is that Sir Attenborough fills you in on some of those photography secrets while leaving you scratching your head wondering ""how did they shoot that"" on others. In this case, the DVD is worth having, there are a few featurets that made you appreciate the work and research that went into this production, not mention interesting fact filies, a series of intriguing and ocassionaly humourous video clips done to the excellent sound tract.  Also this BBC production used more high resolution cameras than some of the other series like ""life of birds"" did. Even apart from clips shot with a starlight camera (those you expect to be a little grainy), there are a small handful of images that were obviously shot with lesser equipment but ,hey, if you can't forgive those than don't buy anything BBC and stick to recent PBS and Nature presentations. As form follows function, so price follows quality, that's true with the BBC, they've made several 10 epeisode nature series and The Life of Mammals is a little more expensive than most, but rightly so. It was better written, produced, and shot with better equipment (for the most part) than the others.",1076544000,6,1591,5.0456273764258555
1829088,5,B000088DSM,"This four disc, ten-episode series is probably the best nature documentary ever produced in DVD format.  In fact, Life of Mammals is reason alone to buy a DVD player if you don't have one.
Here are a few reasons why I think people should shell out the money for this set:
- David Attenborough's enthusiasm for his work.  Watching him respectfully approach a poor-sighted anteater from downwind or barely able to contain his delight when floating a few meters away from a blue whale, Attenborough's love for the animal world is totally infectious.
- The images are of IMAX quality.  This is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen.
- The soundtrack is top notch.
- The Buffalo versus the Lions.  This brief segment is mentioned in the Amazon reviewer's description - it has all the emotion and energy of the Cavalry Charge in 'The Return of the King.' It literally brought tears to my eyes.
- Swimming Elephants.  'nuff said.
- Kids love it.  These films will keep kids (even as young as 2) quiet and totally absorbed in ways that no Blue or Builder Bob video can approach.
- David keeps it light and entertaining.  Each segment is short enough (40 minutes) and has plenty of amazing footage and humorous anecdotes so that it is nearly impossible to get bored of it all.  Just don't watch more than one per day or you will spoil yourself.
I give this series the highest recommendation.  Even if you are not a nature buff (and chances are you will be after seeing this), it is certainly worth bringing into your home.",1076371200,102,1530,4.575091575091575

 David Attenborough is welcome on my screen anytime, especially when he is accompanied by the brilliance demonstrated here in the ""life of mammals"". crystal clear filmography, and scenes only the most experienced crews in the world can provide. I continually tip my hat to the BBC, who never cease to amaze me. I for one, will never question one of thier products again. as long as the BBC is on the label, I will be confident enough to buy it with out review.

1829090,5,B000088DSM,"I purchased ""Life of Mammals"", in part, for my 6-year-old daughter.  After sitting through ""The Deep"" from ""The Blue Planet"" for about the 20th time, I figured it was time for both of us to move on.
Each series has its strong points, but ""Life of Mammals"", in particular, has served to spark her interest in evolution and the classification of animals.  The series is very well suited to facilitate natural explanations for precocious 6-year-olds, even if you are a little sketchy on some of the details yourself.
This is a fantastic series for adults with an interest in armchair life-science, but it is also more than appropriate for children.  In short, don't be put-off, worrying that your kids won't understand it.

He prefers to watch his ""animal movie"" over ALL other options and he is more knowledgeable about mammals than I am. He often provides us with interesting animal facts and pretends to be many of the animals he learns about in the DVD. The DVD is also very interesting for us, his parents, as well. The things captured on film combined with the soundtrack and commentary are amazing! As a parent, you do need to be comfortable that your child will be seeing graphic occurances in nature: birth, death, aggression, etc. My child has not been the least bit frightened or bothered by anything in the DVD series.",1069372800,13,777,4.36551724137931
