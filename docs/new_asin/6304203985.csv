The running commentary (aka  'Riffing')  is drop-dead hilarious in parts, really slow in others.  I  laughted, I cried, I groaned, I snored, I rolled on the floor with laughter  (particularly during their sendup of the ""Mary Poppins""  stop-action segment of the movie.)

First, there would be a science fiction movie that if measured on its own merits would be absolute zero.
Second, the various characters on the ""space ship"" would be compelled to see the movie..
Third, the soundtrack of the movie would either be eclipsed by the ""viewers"" sarcastic comments or in the case the soundtrack was too painful to listen to, the space ship characters would happily substitute more of their own ideas.

The movie is bad, of course, but there's enough happening that it doesn't get boring.  And what happens is weird enough and stupid enough to lead to some very memorable riffs.  Add in some classic running jokes (the ""Chief."" ""McCloud."" gag is one of my all-time favorites) and you have a pristine example of Mystery Science Theater at its best.

If you want to get someone into the show, I heartily recommend this episode.",1343088000,,616,4.5225225225225225

810696,5,6304203985,"Because MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie, I think you need to look at the individual parts in order to rate the program.

The movie: I mean movies. Because there are about 5 unrelated movies going on at the same time.  (To make things even worse (or better), there are even different and unrelated movies playing during the credits!). Eventually they all tie into an off the wall ET rip-off involving a boy with the strangest voice befriending Trumpy the magical... something. This movie is my favorite type: So bad and stupid it is funny.

The Host Segments: Contains one of my favorites when Joel and the bots do their interpretation of a scene (and words) from the movie. I also loved ""Hearts of Space"" segment. The rest are pretty good and I loved Dr. Forrestor's introduction of the movie.

Riffs: Not that any were needed but very fine job by Joel and the bots. A lot of good riffs spread over most of the movie.

Overall: I originally thought about giving ""Pod People"" four stars. But then my wife and I amused ourselves for two months by repeating lines from the movie in the boy's voice (""Trumpy! Why did you kill her Trumpy?""). Unlike some MST3k episodes, you will remember this lovely train wreck for a long time.

****NOTE:  I originally posted this review on Netflix.",1311724800,5,1300,4.553648068669528
810697,5,6304203985,"The movie itself really makes no sense--but that is the beauty of Pod People. Joel and the bots take this incredibly crappy movie and turn it into something hilarious. Even the in-between skits are a riot, especially the one where they make fun of the ""Hear the Engines Roll"" song featured in the film. Their commentary is sharp throughout. As usual, you will need to turn on your pop culture radar to get a lot of the goofy references they make--from jokes about Norm Abrams to the classic 1970s TV series ""McCloud.""

This episode is in my personal top 5 of all time. Highly recommended.

810699,5,6304203985,"This turkey is a perfect example of an unwatchable movie made endearing by the MST3K treatment.  I tend to favor the Mike episodes, but in this Joel effort, he and the Bot's were right on their game.

The story is about aliens which crash on earth and lay some eggs.  One of them, in the possession of a boy, hatches and he now has a new friend. A low budget ""ET"" ripoff, pathetically executed.  (I thought Joel and company missed an opportunity to ridicule the absurd and unexplainable British accent that the boy spoke with).

Lots of disjointed subplots (poachers, a dorky family rock band).  Cheesy looking aliens.  Disorienting editing.  Much fertile MST3K source material.

In the Mystery Science Theater world, this is a 5 star film.

Additionally, if I may use this review to make a general MST3K comment ---During the past couple of weeks, I have worked my way through a stack of Mystery Science videos, watching one during most evenings.  I finally ran out and went to plug in an Outer Limits DVD last night, and, I had the strange sensation that I was going to have to watch the show ""alone"".  I then realized that watching the MST3K films was kind of like going to the movies with friends . . . witty, entertaining friends that I could place on pause when necessary, and then store back in my bookcase before turning into bed.",1192924800,3,1338,4.57563025210084
810700,5,6304203985,"If I can stop chuckling long enough to steady my hand, I'll be able to write this review.  The ""movie"" being mocked never rises above that cheesy camcorder-on-a-weekend feel.  As one of the bots jeered, ""this movie has more fog than the movie ""Fog!""  They were so right to say that the ""plot"" kept shifting from ""movie A"" to ""movie B"" ... up to ""movie D"" for dumb!

At the beginning you'll meet the ""stars"" singing some sort of 60s-a-go-go as background for a pointless and scratchy male singer.  Bang!  We now have characters, plot (I hope you caught it) and [heh heh] soon-to-be victims!  Turn it up baby, it's doesn't get any better!  Actually, it was the only way this ""B-flat movie"" could inject enough victims to get picked off by the space invaders.  Fear not, we move swiftly from that dork recording studio into the wild outdoors, where aliens have, of course, just landed.

Oh, and don't worry about the tall green alien with the sunglasses that you see during the opening credits.  You never see him again.  I guess the writer forgot that loose end, amidst all of his other troubles.

And hey, I hate to pop your bubble, but there ain't no pods in this movie!  And the lip-sync is off soooooo badly, that my 10-year-old daughter had to imitate it all movie long!  Our shadowy commentors made us laugh so hard that I got a headache and had to keep wiping tears of shock off my cheeks!

Late in this shameless production, the boy-star (maybe it was his camcorder that they used to make this thing) shouts that he hates his elephant-nosed friend -- for no apparent reason.  (Of course this is while the rock-singer-turned-camper looks on, and mysteriously has his first moment of compassion as he listens in, and then we realize that he is about 100 yards away... and don't forget the fog and woods blocking his view!  Dang, this movie is BAD!)  Anyway, the bots' comment about the little kid (mind you, people have been killed all movie long) is ""Wow, this kid has mood swings.  That's not good!""

At the end, our comedy trio says what we are all thinking --- ""Let's get outta here!""",1176595200,,2092,4.540106951871658

""The Pod People"" is a movie whose plot is so muddled that it's hard to even explain. An atrocious rock band, torn by the womanizing lead singer, go on a retreat to an isolated location. There they add to the body count created by an unfathomable alien, some heretofore-undiscovered terrestrial life form, or A.L.F. on a bad-hair day -- take your pick. The movie is so incoherent that you can't tell even if people are being killed or simply transformed somehow.

810818,5,6304203985,"Juan Piquer, the Spanish Ed Wood, delivers the goods once again in this spectacularly amateurish movie.  The MST3K treatment is just the icing on the sweet, sweet cake that is this film.
Juan Piquer has never gotten the critical recognition he roundly deserves in the bad movie community.  From early cheapjack efforts like ""Supersonic Man"" (in which a guy in tights uses the ""force of the galaxies"" to lift a cardboard steamroller) to the multileveled horror of ""Pieces"" to the Jack Scalia epic ""Endless Descent,""  Piquer makes movies that make less and less sense, and get funnier and funnier, the more you watch them.  ""Pod People"" is no exception.
The usual players in Piquer's production company make their appearances here.  Frank Brana is the egg poacher (pun intended) in a senseless storyline that merely pads the film and provides some victims for alien attacks.  The inimitable Ian Sera is the self-centered rock star at the center of this tale, a frizzy-permed dork who is no more believable as a rock star here as he was as Kendall James, campus stud, in ""Pieces.""  Even the house from ""Pieces"" makes an appearance, as part of the interior is reused here.
The movie itself lives down to every expectation you might have, in a gleeful disregard of plot, acting, characterization and sense.  Several different ""stories"" are presented at the same time, none of which really connect with any of the others, or go anywhere, or have a conclusion.  As a result, there is ample fodder for some of the best MST3K treatment in the series.  You will stay awake, and laugh, through the entire movie, and possibly even pop it in twice.
It stinks!  And if that's the way you like it, you must purchase this film immediately.  You must also start poking into the entire Juan Piquer oeuvre.  You will not be disappointed.",1082505600,3,1818,4.807073954983923

However, another alien goes on the rampage, killing poachers, rangers, uncles, and the members of a really bad pop band.  The way all of these people are acting in this movie, it comes as a relief when they are picked off one by one.  This is a really low budget deal.

What is it with Spanish film making?  Why are they so [weak] that they take the worst of Hollywood and make it even more terrible than the originals? Let's make the European people suffer, then export this [stuff] to the rest of the world!  Cave Dwellers is another prime example.

The music score of this monstrosity sounds like it was composed by some Orwellian music-oscillator.  Many sub-plots revolve around your brain while watching it.  Perhaps they got the idea from ""Marathon Man.""  Yet, in ""Marathon man,"" all the subplots come together into the climax of the film.  Pod People's sub plots never do that and they will just leave you in lethargic suspense, with an Excederin headache.

The classic example of the above.
We get to suffer through a main plot of a weird Lost In Space type of ""family,"" then some unrelated poachers, then a stupid stinky popular singing band.  These different plots cut in and out of each other and revolve around the movie till your brain is similarly revolving.
  In the singing sub-plot, Joel and the 'bots are hillariously singing along, modifying the lyrics to what the movie is all about, ""Idiot Control.""  Then there cuts in a scene of that stupid house in the mist of the forest while the oscillator whines new age music. Then the poacher scene cuts in with the nonsensical dialogue between the poachers, while Tom Servo makes up a funny conversaton between some deer.  You get to see Joel and the 'bots being put under the anesthesia of it all as they doze off to sleep.  Suddenly it cuts back into that band playing loudly.  Joel and the 'bots are rudely shocked awake and yell a post-nightmare wake-up scream!
Ahhh, Trumpy, the one redeeming feature of the film!  I bet ""Mitchell"" would love to have Trumpy around to vacuum the potato chip crumbs from the inside of his couch!  The special bond between Tommy (can you hear me) and Trumpy hit the soft spot in my heart.  Yet the 'bots riffing of Trumpy left me in a quagmire as all the subplots of the movie did.  Because I was both slightly offended by the 'bots cruelty to Trumpy, while at the same time I was laughing my head off at tne non-stop lampooning of Trumpy, especially by Crow!  That kitty was the real star, as it played continuously with Trumpy's trunk, as Trumpy eyed his smorgasbord.  Crow kept cracking jokes of all the nice ""potatoes"" that Trumpy had to eat!
...
Be prepared to also be confounded by the beginning and the ending of this trollop.  Much like ""Cave Dwellers,"" the beginning and ending scenes are from another movie.  However the beginning scenes roughly paralell what [stuff] u are going to see in the movie, however be it that the creatures are entirely different and the eggs are also different. They look like giant golf balls with lights in them.
Tommy:  ""Trumpy, do you know what play is?
Crow: ""It is when I break you in half!""

810824,5,6304203985,"Pod People, a movie involving no Pods, and four or five plots, and lots of annoying new age music makes this a crowning riffing achievement.  Well, not really, but it's still really funny, and for the precious few episodes available commercially, Pod people is the place to start if you're new to the wonder that is MST3K.  As an irregular viewer but big fan when the series was running on television, being able to get MST3K episodes was a big deal for me; luckily, this was the first episode I bought.  Some of the other episodes available are not nearly as well done, but the first impression rule has stuck.
What makes the movie great is that it is a serious effort at sci-fi that fails so miserably.  The producers of Pod People were trying so hard that the numerous plots and subplots get terribly confusing.  Even the central theme of the movie is in question due to its complexity, is it about xenophobia, or poaching, or what?
It is on this stage that the irreverent SOL crew make some of the funniest ongoing jokes in the series. [""Chief"" ""McCloud""][""Huzzah""]  Also present are critiques of the ridiculous 80's tech music together with some decent between movie scenes with the crew.  If you're new to the MST3K obsession, and like me missed out on some of the series, start here, with Pod People.  You will not regret it.",1060041600,3,1332,4.590717299578059

810930,1,6304203985,"""Pod People"" isn't about pods. It isn't about people. It isn't really about anything. It is quite possibly one of the poorest films of not only our time, but all time. Its actors make Jerry Lewis look like Jimmy Stewart. Its cinematography makes that crappy B-movie you saw on TV last week look like ""Alien."" Its direction style makes ""Battlefield Earth"" seem simple. And its special effects make the old Godzilla movies look like ""The Matrix.""
Its plot--what little (or nothing?) of it there is--seems to be about a group of singers stranded in some American backwoods. There's lots of mist in these woods. In one scene, a local tells a young man, ""Wait 'till day to search for [the alien],"" but this film is so poor that it confuses day for night many times. The mist is just as strong during the day as night. And in one scene, two men go driving, only to arrive at their destination two seasons (yes, you read that correctly) later. Two seasons. Wow, maybe he should invest in a faster car?
This film is quite possibly the choppiest film I've ever seen. You have to see it to believe it. BUT WAIT! Don't see it. It's not worth it. It will scar you for life!
In one scene we see poachers in misty woods, then suddenly we jump to a band of singers blaring into microphones. Then we cut to something that looks like Smuckers Rasberry Jelly, then we cut to a kid looking for centipedes, then an RV driving along a road (which they film for about five minutes, just with aerial shots of this RV driving around). I can hear the director (if there is one): ""We paid for the thing, we're gonna film it!""
After that we jump to the interior of a cave, where the camera literally goes blind. I wish I had. Then we come out at a campsite at night where, after the elapsed time of 57 minutes and 31 seconds, we finally catch a glimpse of the alien of our film, which looks more like the lovechild of Alf and the Elephant Man. It kills people by making jellybeans appear on there head. No doubt Smuckers jellybeans. Talk about product placement.
Then we cut to some whiny orange-haired kid finding a pod in the Smuckers Cave and taking it home, where he plans to hatch it himself. Poor kid. He must not have had many friends. Then the thing hatches, and eats and eats. Somehow, it is amazingly smart, and learns English. The orange kid names it Trumpy. I think he meant to say ""Trunky,"" since it looks like an elephant. Or maybe he was just paying an homage to Donald Trump.
Trumpy is mistaken for the other alien, and the two aliens run around doing stuff. Trumpy is small in one scene, huge in the next. Amazing how much growing goes on during a cut-away. Then Trumpy escapes into the woods where he lives peacefully for the rest of his life. Well, until a poacher comes along and hits the jackpot, at least.
Unlike some films that are ""so bad they're good,"" ""Pod People"" isn't. It is truly mind-numbingly bad. In one scene a man picks up a phone, which is dead for some reason or another. As he tries to get the phone to work, I can imagine what he's really thinking: ""Great, there's no way to get out of this film now!""",1055635200,,3113,4.36896551724138
810931,5,6304203985,"""Pod People"" was the first MST3K episode I ever watched, and remains my very favorite.  While kind of confusing at first, it all comes together eventually.  Joel and the bots comment that it seems to be made up of three different movies.  The first part involves two poachers, one who looks like he belongs in a Renaissance Festival (""Huzzah!"") and another guy who bears an uncanny resemblance to Mr. Magoo (""I'm doing a one-man show: Lesley Neilson, Lesley Neilson, Lesley Neilson!"") A little redheaded kid is in the movie later.  He collects all kinds of creepy-crawlies and rodents.  When he stumbles upon ""The Gates of Hell"", he finds an egg, and puts it in his bed.  ""Oh, he's trying to hatch the egg.  What is he, Horton?""  When ""Trumpy"", an alien with a elephant-like snout hatches, he and Tommy turn his room into a mix between Mary Poppins and Gumby.  Also, a [terrible]band sings a stupid song.  ""Hey, it's Greg Brady!"" ""Young Republicans- they're so hip!"" ""Lyrics by Mrs. Johnson's kindergarten class!""  Add a whole lot of fog and an airhead named Laura, and you've got Pod People.",1032825600,5,1092,4.75531914893617
810932,4,6304203985,"Some MST3K movies I just can't bare to see. They are so bad it's almost painful to sit and watch. This is one of them. However Mike and bots make it endurable.
So many things in this ""film"" are so mindless and stupid it's a wonder how anyone could think of making it a movie. Many of the old 1940s-1960s B movies had a forgivable quality to them in that they were B movies and didn't hide it. A spaceship on a string or hero in a spandex jumpsuit was to be expected. Here however is a B movie in colorful 70s-80s, and thinks it should be taken seriously.
What killed me about Pod People is that the featured alien is the least threatening thing I have seen. Alf was creepier. It doesn't attach it self to peoples faces, have acid for blood, or even drip goo at any time. Nothing cool! No oozing goo! I mean come on! And it kills with by whacking people with its hand for little reason. Other things made this hard for me to watch. The film is shot with constant fog in the background. Characters contradict them selves every other line. The setting is drab and ugly. Most of the ""plot"" is pointless and irritating. Hair and clothes styles are awful, even in the decade it was made. This is MST3K at it's worst, and that's when it's the best.
Mike and bots are generally funny and it's worth a few good laughs. Just don't pay too much attention to the movie or you will go blind.",1031356800,,1378,4.223484848484849
810933,4,6304203985,"I consider the Pod People a fairly average MST3K episode--that of course means it is very funny, but I can't put this one anywhere near the top of my favorites list.  Certainly, there are some great aspects to this one, such as the repeated Huzzah! and McCloud lines (which never get old) and Servo's memorable Yoda impersonations.  The Pod People is hopelessly pointless, somewhat depressing, and downright unwatchable; Joel and the Bots had a dickens of a job in making this episode hilarious, but somehow they did it.  The movie is so bad that it is not even listed in my comprehensive video movie guide.  Half of the movie's budget (which I estimate to have been about $100 altogether) was spent on fog machines.  Apparently, the producers thought that hiding all the action and characters in a deep fog would help keep viewers from realizing how atrocious the movie is--they were quite wrong.
For starters, the opening credits feature clips from some other movie--the Creature From the Black Lagoon-looking monster here has nothing to do with our movie, which features the ridiculous-looking Trumpy, a hairy bipedal pig-type alien.  The first characters we see are poachers (who look like Lorne Greene and Dan Fogelberg) who apparently make their living by stealing birds' eggs.  They are too dense to notice a gigantic explosion in the woods caused by a falling object.  The producers lull you into the belief that no scene or characters can be worse than this one, but don't let them fool you.  As if by magic, we are transported to a cheap music recording studio and forced to listen to the worst group of singers on earth.  Meanwhile, back in the woods, a little red-haired kid finds a giant egg in the woods, brings it home, and hatches it--enter Trumpy.  Unfortunately, another pod person is roaming the land killing everyone it meets.  When the lousy young singers go camping in these woods, there are put on a collision course with the funny-looking alien.  There's more fun later as the annoying kid tries to protect his new friend.  I could go on, but there is really no reason to--this movie's plot is almost nonexistent.  Maybe a judge forced a producer to make the worst movie he could possibly make as punishment for some heinous crime--that's the only way I can explain this movie's origin.
I mentioned the terrible, supposedly hip music the band sings.  Amazingly, it is actually much better than the funky New Age sounds the viewer is bombarded with throughout all the other sections of the movie.  The skits feature SOL versions of the goofy band song as well as some repetitive Yanni-like New Age sounds as performed by ""Some Guys in Space.""  They are really in a singing mood because they close with the haunting ""Clown in the Sky.""  Joel rather than Tom Servo does most of the singing, which is probably one reason I don't particularly care for the song skits.  Personally, I would not recommend this video as a newbie's introduction to MST3K; it's good, but it's far from the best.  By all means, buy it, though.
I would be remiss if I did not point out that The Pod People does have one talented actor.  The kid's kitten truly shines among a cast of absolute nobodies, responding to cues perfectly, foregoing the use of a stunt kitten in the scenes in which he is tossed from one piece of furniture to another, and executing the ""hiding under the bed"" scene to perfection.  Sadly, his aspiring career as a cat among cats was cut short prematurely due to the utter inanity of this movie in which he, much to his regret, signed on board to do.",1028851200,2,3569,4.7117552334943635

Here's the story:
A group of really bad and argumentative musicians decide to go on vacation to some place that is mountainous and always shrouded in fog.  They end up taking a groupie along with them whom everyone (especially the other women in the group) hates.  At the same time, a trio of stupid poachers, consisting of Lorne Green, Norm Abrahams and a Rennaissance Festival leather mug-maker investigate a meteor that hit the ground near there.  The meteor turns out to be a ship (i guess it was a ship, even though the budget, apparently, wouldn't allow for one to be shown) loaded with eggs that hatch into a cross between ET and snuffelupaguss.  Norm Abrahams smashes a bunch of the eggs, which causes an adult alien to kill him and hunt down his buddies.  Meanwhile, a young, insect-collecting boy finds one of the eggs and decides to hatch it in his bed (ewwww!).  The musicians find themselves at the boy's house eventually, after causing the death of the groupie that went with them.  Well, the egg hatches, and the alien, whom the boy calls Trumpy, is actually very nice, but his magic act [is bad].  However, his relative who killed the poachers isn't nearly as friendly, and sets about killing the musicians and the boy's curmudgeon of an uncle.  Finally, the kid sends Trumpy packing into the forest because he knows that humans and trunked aliens cannot live in peace.
Man, this movie is REALLY bad.  But Joel and the Bots make it fun.  Most of the jokes are dead-on in this one, with very few clunkers.

As I've said in other reviews, I think the early episodes displayed a kind of exuberant playfulness that wasn't always present in later years. When combined with the MST brand of humor (which was always top-notch), a lot of really great episodes came out of these two seasons. 'Pod People' is one of the best.
'Pod People' seems to begin as three or four different films, as Joel and The Bots (J&TB) note with some confusion. The threads begin to knit together, though, as various folks suffer sudden and mysterious deaths in the foggy woods. Could 'Trumpy' -- our cute little ol' space alien hellbeast with telekinetic powers -- be involved?
This bizarre movie prompts J&TB to some great riffing. But the host segments are where this episode really shines. The parody of an unintelligible song by the film's talentless rock band ... the 'Music from Some Guys in Space' broadcast and Crow's New Age Yanni lick ... the exploding guitar in the Invention Exchange ... and the timeless classic 'Clowns in the Sky' at the end -- all these and more make 'Pod People' one of my very favorite MST episodes.",1007337600,2,1192,4.654028436018957

811102,5,6304203985,"This movie, is the best MST3k out there. At all. End of story. The movie ""the Pod People"" is worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space. Or any Ed  Wood movie for that matter. An Alf looking creature (Trumpy) and his  brother, go an a killing spree. Some poachers and naive teenagers must stop  them. That's the story line. The characters (and directers) do some really  daft things. It is winter, then when they drive to the neighboor's, it's  SPRING! (as the bots put it, the two season drive). Why the hell was there  a man with an ""I'm a Virgin"" shirt on commenting on a crappy rock  band? WHY? Why does the credits at the beginning show something *not* at  all in the movie? WHY? Why does the man who finds the alien eggs SMASH them  all? (as the bots put it: He's an LAPD officer!)Those are just the tip of  the iceberg. The really sweet material is the sheer riffs. To Look for:  ""McCloud!"", ""Huzzah""!, ""Look, the camera man  looked through the wrong lens!"", and many more. But the ultimate riff:  ""It's called evil kid"". Also, the special effects are 1950's ish.  Mary Poppins made things float better than Trumpy did. Just see this movie  at all costs.",966038400,9,1153,4.423809523809524
811103,5,6304203985,"This was the first MST3K episode I've seen before season five, and it was weird!  The host segments were weak because they were just repeating sceans from the movie.  The riffs didn't start getting realy funny until somewhere  in the middle, but this is probably because I was too buisy staring at Crow  because his net kept appearing and disappearing.  The movie made no sense  at all and is defenatly MST3K material!
Favorite riff-Tom Servo:  ""He stepped in his Tumpy-Dumpy!""",962323200,,477,4.8875
811104,5,6304203985,"As I write my review, the average customer review for this one is 5 Stars. That says it all right there.
I laughed so hard during some parts of this show that I was crying. The way that Trumpy was able to magically  alter the kid's room, making his ""Simon"" game go wacko and all of  his clothes come flying out of his closet, was hilarious even without Joel  and the Robots' comments.
When they were commenting on the movie, I  laughed even harder. My favorite line was after the lady told the teens to  let the girl who had fallen off a cliff get a good night's sleep, Joel  commented, ""Yeh, that's what cures a crushed spine!""
There was  TERRIBLE music in this one (""Ringo did some bad stuff, but  this? ""...""It stinks!""), so Joel and the Robots were about  to do a few Yanni licks on their synthesizers during a break.
Never a  dull moment in this one. If you want to see if you might like MST3K, watch  this one first. This is what it's all about!",960508800,4,951,4.227777777777778

It was tough deciding which I loved least--the evil red-headed step child or Greg  Brady's rock band.  I love all MST3K episodes...I just loved this one a  little less. The episodes saving grace was Joel and the bots' performance  of the Brady Band's ""Gearin up and Ready to Roll"". Or was it  ""Giddyup I'm Ready to Go""? Or was it ""Idiots, I'm Ready to  Grow""? Hard tellin, but whatever the title was, I had my zippo  lit--waitin for the encore. Not my favorite episode, but definitely not the  worst I've seen.",958521600,3,643,4.530434782608696

In one of them, egg hunters are out in a  forrest and find Yoda's Shack with some alien eggs in it.  Then, Tommy,  little kid who loves animals, finds an egg and out comes Trumpy (if Alf  dated an elephant).  Well, Trumpy can do stupid things!

When Trump starts doing his magic and that  kid says that he can do magic, and then Tom Servo says ""It's called  evil kid"" was my favorite riff. The segments were also brilliant.

The movie kinda haunted me, and even Joel and the bots great riffing couldn't save it. The movie is a  terrifying story about how a boy finds an alien egg which hatches into  Trumpy, a snaffuluphigus-like animal. The boy and Trumpy are friends till  Trumpy's brother is provoked by nasty poachers. Then Trumpy's brother  starts going on a killing spree. Not that I didn't like this episode, but  the movie was one of the worst ever made, it wasn't a fun bad like Manos or  Mitchell is, it's just horrible. It's like ET seen through an odd foggy  European filter. And the boy has a hanis dubbed voice. It makes you prey  the monster will do away with him next. If that happened, it would  exellerate the rating of this to five stars!!",933120000,6,848,4.490196078431373
7864992,4,6304203985,"POD PEOPLE (MST3K Episode 303) is a source movie viewers either tolerate or despise.  Joel and the bots to the rescue!  Their wit is based on perception as well as wordplay and association -- as Joel says, it really does consist of ""Movie A"" (described as the ""Partridge Family bus""), the 'bus' actually a Winnebago they drive through the forest to ""Movie B"" -- yup, any overstressed mother living in remote woods with a super-demanding nine-year-old is happy to welcome seven complete strangers into her home on no notice.  Moreover, it's a shameless ripoff of E.T. in which the charming alien is certainly an alien, yet anything but charming -- he resembles an anteater with Margaret Keane eyes.  Add to that the inferior special effects, nothing dialog, woozy photography, flat acting, and nearly-incessant fog that rivals THE SLIME PEOPLE for overuse, and you have an intolerable commercial film -- and a bonanza for Joel and the bots.  I like Episode 303; I just don't love it.  But even if this sow's ear couldn't be made into the nicest of silk purses, it's still a puncture-proof container for sharp Mistie humor.

Blame the outfit that re-released POD PEOPLE in 1990, the original American distributor having gone belly up in 1985 after its CEO disappeared, along with a million dollars of the company's money.

As for the movie itself, it's one of the most risible things ever to appear on MST3K, an attempt to cross a low-budget, shooting-gallery-type horror movie with the childish whimsy of E.T.
