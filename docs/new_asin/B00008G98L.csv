7984255,1,B00008G98L,"While I have not seen Valentin De La Sierra, I have recently watched Soy El Hijo Del Gallero and was not impressed. I live in Mexico and regularly view Mexican films; El Hijo Del Gallero was horrendous! A similar, but infinitely better film is El Gallo Del Oro (1964) directed by Roberto Gavaldon and starring the ever impressive Ignacio Lopez Tarso. It was written by Juan Rulfo who is also co-wrote Imperio de la Fortuna (1986)-- another similar, but much better movie. It was directed by the internationally renowned director Arturo Ripstien. Please do not think Hijo Del Gallero is representative of this genre of Mexican film.",1106265600,,631,4.906542056074766
