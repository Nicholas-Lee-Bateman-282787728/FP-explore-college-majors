8763925,5,B01GWCB2JM,"Tracy Lords (Katharine Hepburn) of the privileged strata of society is getting married again. This time to a man, George Kittredge (John Howard), who started at the bottom of a coal mine and worked his way to the top. Dexter (Cary Grant) her first husband invites himself to the wedding and the wedding preparations. Also inviting their selves with the help of a little blackmail to the wedding is a writer, and photographer, from a magazine of dubious reputation.

Throw in a philandering father (John Halliday) and a friendly uncle (Roland Young.) We watch as they go through the motions and emotions of courting and re-evaluating their lives.

The play was made into movies several times. However the one that most people remember is after this version is ""High Society"" with (1956) with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly.

This is basically a comedy and yes it has all the actors and writers to make this a piece of cinematic art. However you will find it is just fun to watch.",1502755200,,975,4.723529411764706
