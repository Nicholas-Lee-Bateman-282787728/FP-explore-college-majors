It is so bad it's actually bad, not in the Plan 9 From Outer Space way which is the work of someone misguided but passionate and sincere.  Alien Encounter at Loch Ness is just terrible. I'm sorry I can't say anything better but I felt I should warn others. I can't imagine the filmmakers being even remotely proud of this work.",1461283200,,425,4.379746835443038
