* Guys appear doing some simple knife defense techniques for 10 seconds....then they spend 5 minutes talking about they're simple- common sense moves. They don't even ""repeat/slow motion/view from a different angle""  this simple / novice techniques...they just talk. No seal action, No spirit in the way the do the simple techniques...theyre just there..playing knife fighting.
* They talk, talk and talk....wheres the action!!!...where are the super knife combat techniques of navy seals.....nowhere...at least not here....in this video.
* They tell their ""combat experiences""....wow!.....then you see a bunch of guys sitting in  the floor watching the grand master talk talk and talk. NO ACTION .  NO TECHNIQUES.
* Then ...after all the talk, they spend almost 17 minutes of the video showing you the different types of combat knifes....i didn't bought this tape to saw all the different combat knifes aveilable in the market....i did it becouse im looking for techniques....HOW TO....how to improve my techniques, Knowledge in the matter.....but that is what you will not find in this tape.
Please, don't waste your money....as i did.

7886675,2,6305120870,"This video is more about describing the brutality of an edged weapon then it is for explaining how to fight with one.  If you want a video that's mostly demonstration, theories, and a discussion in knife tactics, then this is for you.  However if you want a hands-on course on how to defend yourself with an edged weapon with technique drills and all, you best look elsewhere.  Buy some Philipino knife-fighting videos instead.",994291200,2,427,4.821917808219178
