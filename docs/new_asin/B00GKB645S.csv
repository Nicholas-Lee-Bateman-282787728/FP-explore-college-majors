8624021,4,B00GKB645S,"Best video was of Ali and Chuvalo. If you want to see Ali do his best style for fifteen rounds watch this fight. Chuvalo took Ali fifteen rounds...he was really tough. Ali won on points. He was unable to stop Chuvalo.

But Ali showed the greatest endurance and speed. Most people won't understand the stamina it takes to punch for fifteen rounds. Ali was not an undefeated boxer, he is famous for having great fights.

Like Chuvalo, Marciano would have taken Ali to the end of the fifteenth round. Marciano never really fought great boxers. Archie Moore and Joe Walcot made the Marciano fights interesting. George Foreman, Ken Norton, and Joe Frazier would have beat Marciano. Sorry, that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.",1474675200,,725,4.792

8624029,5,B00GKB645S,"My wife bought this as a Christmas gift for me because I was wanting some Marciano fights. This boxer was talked about by my father as if he was the closest thing to a god that ever wore gloves. Muhammad Ali is hyped as being the best. He is not. Ali fought in reverse. A coward fights backing up. And judging from the fact that Ali refused to serve our country, I say that is accurate. Plus he lost several times in his career. He was fast. But he was a big talker. Marciano was the true ""greatest of all time"". He fought straight on, no retreat, no bragging, no mercy. 49 wins, 43 knockouts and ZERO loses!!! Retired undefeated heavyweight champ of the world. The greatest....Ali? Nope! Try the Brockton Blockbuster, Rocky Marciano! Great footage. Good price for an awesome record of boxings true "" greatest "".",1419638400,9,812,4.493243243243243
