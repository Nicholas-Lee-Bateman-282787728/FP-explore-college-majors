7554901,5,B018TNBX50,"- Allie: ""What about the crown?""
- Maximillian: ""It survived a thousand years. It could survive a girl from Brooklyn.""

If it ain't broke, don't fix it, eh, Hallmark? Folks have been generally kind towards A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS and A ROYAL CHRISTMAS. For its 2015 Countdown to Christmas rollout, Hallmark presents two more holiday movies with a royal theme. And, dang it, both are excellent. ONCE UPON A HOLIDAY stars Briana Evigan as a runaway princess in New York  la ROMAN HOLIDAY. CROWN FOR CHRISTMAS aired two days later and bowled me over with how I couldn't keep my eye off Danica McKellar, my long-time crush, AND with its fine execution of a very familiar plot.

31-year-old Alison Evans (McKellar) is struggling in Brooklyn. The past due bills are mounting. She raised her two younger siblings by her lonesome, and she's still filling that role even though they're pretty much grown-up now. Allie is a maid in Brooklyn toiling away at a swanky hotel and she's hoping the tips and the upcoming Christmas bonus will keep the Evans fam afloat a bit longer. Allie is reassigned to the hotel's VIP floor and, oh, if only she'd heeded her supervisor's admonition to not make eye contact when up there. But Allie is the free-spirited sort who reaches out and who speaks her mind. Right before Christmas, Allie gets sacked. Luckily, someone was listening in during her dismissal, so cue a job offer for Allie. Only, it's a governess post and it's only during this holiday season and it's overseas in some European nation called Windshire. Allie is skeptical but she's reassured her temp gig would be just like Mary Poppins ""but without the umbrella and the bottomless bag."" Heh.

What no one told her, at least not until she was pulling up to the castle, is that she'll be minding a mischievous 10-year-old princess, Theodora (Ellie Botterill), a terror of a child who delights in torturing authority figures with rudeness and pranks. And comes maybe my favorite element of this movie, which is how Allie behaves towards Theodora. Allie, used to raising unruly hellions (like her siblings), doesn't go about trying to scold or mold Theodora - or ""Teddy"" - into a prim and proper princess. Allie, instinctively, steps back and allows Teddy to be herself. I can't even dis the movie for how quickly Teddy - who, when you peel away the naughtiness, is just a lonely and neglected little girl - comes to trust and rely on Allie. Wouldn't you? Allie is wicked awesome. I laughed at her attempts to curtsy because she is so very awkward (and cute) about it. There's also a short scene in which she makes math a fun time for Teddy, and I remember all over again that Danica McKellar is a math whiz in real life.

I've been on and on about Danica but the rest of the cast are equally marvelous. Not only does Danica have fantastic chemistry with young Ellie Botterill but as well with Rupert Penry-Jones (whom women have swoon over in PERSUASION and the remake of THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS). What is it about Brits and their imposing accent and diction? Penry-Jones flawlessly fits the role of King Maximillian III, a bloke what's torn between his duties as a monarch and his preferences as a man. Max would rather not be engaged to the ambitious Lady Celia of Luxembourg (Alexandra Evans). Max would rather spend more time with his daughter than attend this or that dreary royal function. Max relishes his visits to New York since, there, he can blend in with the crowd or inconspicuously stand in line or be yelled at by some cabbie. It's no surprise that he's so drawn to Allie who is unconventional and so refreshing and as plain-talking as the day is long. Penry-Jones knows how to dial up the regal but then, when called for, he allows his humanity to shine thru. And as much as I enjoyed the moments of blossoming romance between the king and the governess, I'm most moved by the king's affectionately dancing with his little girl at the ball (yes, don't be so shocked, there is a Christmas ball).

We're treated to three ""villains"" in Lady Celia, that mean, prune-faced staff member Miss Wicks (Amy Marston), and, most notably, Chancellor Riggs (Colin McFarlane), strident advisor to the throne and a control freak who fancies himself the puppet master. See these three do their durndest to sabotage Allie in the palace. To counter such enmity, there's Fergus (Pavel Douglas) the butler, kind and wise and not averse to the occasional frolic. He acts as the voice of reason in the household, and couldn't we all use someone like him as a constant in our lives?

I think I may love CROWN FOR CHRISTMAS even more than A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS. And maybe Danica McKellar is the tie-breaker. She is luminous in this one. The cast elevates this shindig. I don't think I've mentioned it yet, but the young actress, Ellie Botterill, is a stand-out. I hope Hallmark has her doing more movies. Anyway, my list of must-watch-every-Christmas Christmas movies keeps on growing. My poor couch must loathe Christmas.

Oh, and, yeah, for now, Walmart does have the DVD cheaper.

7554902,5,B018TNBX50,"Everyone involved in Crown for Christmas should be burned at the stake. That is the just punishment for witchcraft.

The movie has certainly bewitched me. It is not the run-of-the-mill Christmas movie. It is far better and more beguiling than that. The synopsis at first sounds pedestrian, but the writing is far above the commonplace. It is an endearing story of a neglected little girl, a preoccupied single parent, and a remarkable young woman who brings fresh air to their relationship.

Danica McKellar brings great physical beauty and remarkable acting skills to her part. She deserves to be placed In the top rank of actresses after this tour-de-force.  The other cast members - the  King, Princess, butler and cook especially - are also excellent as actors and compelling as wonderful human beings.

On a scale of one to five, I would award this movie a ten.",1449446400,56,866,4.904109589041096

7554994,4,B018TNBX50,"""Crown for Christmas"" (2015) is an entertaining story in the ""Hallmark Christmas movie"" genre.

Danica McKellar plays a charming and industrious hotel maid from New York City who gets a new job in Europe as a governess.

As it turns out, her new job is in the fictional kingdom of Winshire, taking care of the king's school-age daughter and living in the beautiful royal castle. Rupert Penry-Jones plays the handsome young king who is widowed and sad.

Will the mean government Chancellor force Rupert to marry the shallow Countess, who hates children?  Or will he marry Danica, who loves children AND loves Christmas?

Overall, this is an enjoyable Hallmark Channel made-for-TV movie.

(Other Hallmark Christmas movies I enjoyed are ""The Christmas Ornament"" starring Kellie Martin, and ""A Princess for Christmas"" starring Katie McGrath.)",1515542400,,838,5.2631578947368425

7555023,5,B018TNBX50,"After seeing this movie twice, I yearn to see it yet again.  The three main actors, along with a superb supporting cast, made this film a joy to watch.  I thought Rupert Penry-Jones was perfectly cast in his role as King Maxmillian.  Likewise, Ellie Botterill was spot on as the King's ""slightly wayward"" young daughter (Rupert P-J's apt description when interviewed for Hallmark Channel about the movie).

Allie (Danica McKellar), the new, unconventional, governess, provides comic relief to the royal household, allowing the King to shed some of the rites of decorum imposed on him by virtue of his noble birth. More importantly, Allie excels in her ability to bond with young Theodora who, at age 9, is prone to acting out in negative ways since her mother's death several years earlier.

Allie's beauty and heartfelt expressions as she falls in love with King Maxmillian infuse a convincing portrayal of love-in-waiting, a prospect that at times seems less than promising since royal protocol has already selected the King's next wife.

Although this movie is classified as a fairy tale of sorts, trinkets of realism sparkle amidst the royal rubies.  Love cannot be valuated, and the heart won't be coerced nor deceived.  Although King Maxmillian's betrothed has been chosen for him based on her compatible, royal lineage, the King's heart refuses to conform to tradition, and to his heart he remains true.

Now if only Hallmark would create a sequel to A Crown for Christmas, casting the same actors only.  The chemistry between the two lead actors combined with the saucy personality of young Theodora could not be easily duplicated.",1510876800,,1639,5.059479553903346

If you are familiar with the many Christmas type movies that Hallmark puts out each season, you will know what to expect  . . .  no foul language, no violence, no inappropriate content.  Hallmark has at least three movies involving the royals, and commoners, this is by far the best.  The plot involves a NY City hotel housekeeper who winds up being the nanny for a spoiled, naughty young princess in Europe.  She falls in love with the King (a widower), who is to be engaged to someone deemed appropriate for the royals.  What makes this movie better than the others is the relationship between the young princess and the nanny.  Its believable to see their relationship grow.  The casting is perfect, and you can actually feel the bond between the child and the nanny.  Then, there are those in the Kings staff trying to sabotage the nanny.  Of course, it all ends well, and the nanny gets her King.",1508198400,,1008,4.538888888888889

As HMark movies go, usually following the same old formula, I did not expect anything all that memorable. This is one movie that has restored my faith in family films that can be enjoyed by all. As movies go, there is an exceptional time-line problem in which the viewer must suspend disbelief; that given, the movie moves at a fast pace and has enjoyable characters. Utilizing class conflict, political intrigue and understandable conflict, the author and actors show a Christmas transformation that changes a King, his daughter, and others into real and functional people. What is truly amazing is the young actress who plays the princess. Having undergone a tragedy that no child should have to experience, she reacts in a believable rebellious manner only to be transformed by an equally talented actress portraying the governess. The interaction between these two characters is spectacular resulting in a performance that deserves an award. Truly, this movie will remain a classic for all times.",1495670400,,1073,5.067796610169491

Plus, Danica McKellar did a very good job as the governess.  Of course, all things royal and throw in Christmas is wonderful to watch.  All little girls want to grow up and be a princess; therefore, a proper, romantic prince is just the thing.  I must give credit to the little girl who played the prince's daughter.  She was a fantastic little actress.  And of course, the governess, rather poor ending up with her prince on her arm is always a fun and fairy tale ending.

7555185,4,B018TNBX50,"This was a great movie! Not the best ever, but I enjoyed it (even with Danica McKellar's little math agenda bit included). I love contemporary royal romances, and this one has everything you could ever ask for - a woman caught up in a Cinderella story (and even though the movie tells us that the heroine Allie is 31 years old, I know Danica's in her 40s and couldn't quite suspend my disbelief there. Why not make her late thirties/early forties?). The princess was adorable, and the nanny/child relationship was refreshingly sweet and believable. The acting was all excellent with quite a few laugh out loud lines and scenes thrown in.

There wasn't as much romance as I would typically hope for, and up until the end of the movie I might have even said the chemistry was lacking. But when the king lays that kiss on Allie...oh my. That was melt your face off hot and filled with combustible chemistry! I enjoyed all the supporting actors and their stories, and loved that Allie got her fairy tale. Danica McKellar brought her to life in a way that made her fun and enjoyable and relatable while also being able talented enough to carry the movie.

So for you Hallmark lovers out there who adore these Christmas movies and/or royal romances, definitely watch this one!",1484784000,,1270,4.665178571428571

7555215,4,B018TNBX50,I really liked this one. I am an avid watcher of Christmas movies. I start after Thanksgiving and watch them into early January. This one is fun and family friendly. I like the main characters role and the premise of the story. The love interest is believable and the bonds that develop between new friends and child are also heartwarming. Some great ending lines. I will return to it every year.,1483747200,,396,4.591549295774648

7555225,1,B018TNBX50,"Every year, Hallmark comes out with new Christmas movies. We all know how they're going to end because no one has had a fresh idea in ages. However, this is always one or two surprises and I try to by those in case they aren't shown again. (Three Days, for example) However, I will not be purchasing this one. I didn't like the same old story and honestly, I didn't like the actors. I seem to be in the minority here, but I couldn't stand this movie. It was on so many times this year and my husband and I would say, ""not again"". Then we'd watch one of our DVD's from previous years. If you're not surprised that a prince falls in love with a commoner and every commoner wants to be a princess, apparently, then you'll like this movie. We're all different and that's what makes the world go around. So my husband and I are different. We hated this movie, the plot and the actors. Do they have to do this every year?",1483488000,,915,4.204545454545454

I hope Hallmark continue to offer these season great ones for us and especially in multi shows on one Dvd or 2!!  I will just keep adding them because for me--they make Christmas Christmas!!  And I love Danika McKellar!!  She is just so real and down to earth in every movie she is in!! And Rupert Penry-Jones...well what's not to like!!,1482969600,,562,4.407766990291262

7555249,5,B018TNBX50,"I love this movie. It reminds me of a Christmas version of Fran Drescher and Timothy Dalton's ""Beautician and the Beast,"" which was one of my favorites. The actors in this are all very good from Danica McKellar to the people who played the staff. I buy very few of the Hallmark Christmas movies because I receive great joy watching them every year on the Countdown to Christmas, but this one I purchased and I also purchased ""The Nine Lives of Christmas"" and will purchase ""Journey Back to Christmas"" when it is available. Another good one, which is available on Amazon, is ""The Spirit of Christmas."" This particular movie here gives us all hope that maybe just somewhere we truly can find our Prince Charming who will make us his princess.",1482796800,,740,4.656488549618321

7555252,5,B018TNBX50,Seen this on Hallmark and liked it. Good storyline. Danica is a fantastic actress and love to watch her mannerisms during the movie. Those small things make a difference.

7555257,4,B018TNBX50,"Like a lot of Hallmark romances, this one involves royalty and a commoner.  Apparently, everyone wants to be a princess and Christmas seems like the best time to accomplish this.  In this case, an untalented artist (Danica McKellar as Allie) is working to support her adult siblings.  She is a maid.  She works in a snooty hotel where she meets an undercover king (Rupert Penry-Jones) who just happens to need a nanny.  Allie gets fired from her job and moves to Europe to take care of the kings daughter.
The outcome, of course, is obvious at the outset.  Even so, they had to strain the plot to make it all work out.

This overly cutesy movie has a few fun moments and some amiable characters.  But it is plagued by that nagging suspicion that the story feels a tad too familiar because Hallmark will keep recycling plot ideas with very little variation.",1482710400,,856,4.5855263157894735

When I watched the movie (3 times) on the Hallmark Channel, it was in HD and filled my screen and the characters' faces were clear.  This DVD does not fill the screen and when you zoom on it to do so, the non-HD (standard?) may even become worse.  It looks almost fuzzy.  I cannot see anywhere on the ad or the packaging that says standard vs. HD, so I thought I was getting exactly what I saw on the Hallmark Channel.  Bummer.",1481760000,9,636,3.9375

I also loved ""Fergus""and ""Helen.""  There was NOTHING about the movie that I didn't like.  Being a math teacher, I even enjoyed the math lesson Danica presented used gingerbread cookies. Colin McFarlain (sp ?) was great as Chancellor Riggs--though I did not favor the character he played, which I suppose was the point!!! The acting was so convincing that by the end of the movie I could envision Max, Ally, and Theodora living in the castle in Windshire with the wonderful staff, living happily ever after.",1456272000,,654,4.821428571428571

7555506,5,B018TNBX50,"This moving piece has clean dialogue that is well performed by the artists with non-offensive audio-visual appeal.  It rebrands the common as royalty with a glimpse of how big or small those entrusted with power can be, and demonstrates the ongoing effects of suffering.  It sheds light on merged family bonding, levels of supportiveness, and shining strengths, like gracious self-honesty in the face of a range of immature behaviors from others.  I compliment Hallmark for polished creations like these and their 2015 Christmas lineup.

7555552,5,B018TNBX50,I love Danica McCellar who is a Math wiz. There is an instance where she was fractions to Teddy. I enjoyed watching this fun and heartwarming movie. I recorded it in my DVR and watched it at least three times !!! I plan to do so even if it isn't the holidays because it brings back the spirit of the season.,1451952000,,307,4.049180327868853
7555553,5,B018TNBX50,"I look forward to Hallmark Christmas movies every year and Crown for Christmas was a standout.  It was the best of this year's line up.  It followed the conventions of the genre beautifully with a fresh and engaging script, wonderful performances, good direction -- and I loved the music too.  If you enjoy this type of movie, this one is for you.",1451779200,,347,4.564516129032258

7555556,5,B018TNBX50,"First off I must confess to loving Rupert Penry-Jones so will watch anything he's in ever since seeing him in the 2007 production of ""Persuasion,"" which, by the way, is available here.  Anyway, this is a delightful modern ""Cinderella"" story.  I could do without some of Ms. McKellar's furrowed brow and obvious coyness expressions, but the young actress Emily Botterill, who plays the princess, is a real scene stealer.  It really was great casting, everyone is good in it so I have no hesitation in recommending it.  I, too, searched for the DVD on Walmart's website and it's out of stock as of this posting, but was cheaper than Amazon is asking, something like $14.95.",1451606400,,671,4.808695652173913

7555558,5,B018TNBX50,"If there was space to rate this with more stars, I would give it 5 more for a total of 10! I have watched this Movie as much as I could when I saw it on. I love this Hallmark Movie, it is my favorite of all that I have seen this Season! Danica McKellar is so cute, with her big brown eyes! Rupert Penry Jones is also very handsome, and they make the perfect couple for this movie! I am planning on buying this one, who ever has it at the best price! My Aunt did not get to see it and now they have stopped showing it on the Hallmark Channel. I want her to see it, so I am going to buy it for her! I never get tired of watching it!",1451520000,3,630,3.674074074074074
7555559,5,B018TNBX50,"The movie Crown for Christmas has to be one of the best Christmas movies that I have ever seen on the Hallmark Channel.  If you believe in romance this movie will thrill you so very much and if you are not a believer in romance then watch this movie and you will become a believer.  Excellent acting by everyone especially Danica, Rupert and the little girl that played his daughter.  All I can say is the casting on this movie was perfect everyone did their part to absolute perfection.  I have watched it every time it came on during the holiday season and finally purchased it here on Amazon but intend of heading to Walmart to buy yet another copy that might be a little cheaper, i hope.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie because I do not think that it is on anymore this season, you will not be sorry you did.",1451520000,16,820,4.264516129032258
7555560,5,B018TNBX50,There should be more movies likes this. Each time it has been on I have watched it over and over. I taped it so I can look at it all year through. Great acting. Had never seen the little girl that played Theadora or Maxwell. Would love to see them in other movies. Had seen Ally before and she is a great actress. In fact all who played in the movie were super. More movies like this!!!,1451520000,,386,4.025974025974026
7555561,5,B018TNBX50,I loved this movie and watched it several times.  I hope it comes out on a separate DVD. The current price is a little steep for me.,1451433600,,132,3.888888888888889
7555562,5,B018TNBX50,"I don't really have much to add from the other 5-star reviewers here. I agree with them completely! I, too, have watched every time it aired this Christmas [including tonight at 8p], I, too, think Danica and Rupert take a charming script and make it way better, and the butler and the princess are great, etc. Oh, and I loved the grand duke villain. Who is that actor? Can't wait to find more things to watch him in.

I'll just add this. So often these movies are fun to watch for the holidays, but the chemistry is not always where I think it should be. Not a problem here. At all. The kiss that seals the deal is worth waiting for. You see two people who have discovered a real passion for each other, not the standard ""face each other under the mistletoe and slowly lean in for the dainty parting kiss"" shot. It's a very satisfying ending that does the rest of the movie justice.

And yes, I'll be buying the DVD [just not for $90.00+].",1451347200,,939,4.299435028248587

7555565,5,B018TNBX50,"This movie was a pleasant holiday suprise.  It was so well made, classy and reminded me of an old time movie.  The leads were excellent , Kudos to whoever cast this film.  I don't ever think about purchasing a Hallmark movie, but this one I would.  I would love to see them do a sequel.  Danica was  beautiful and refreshing in the role and I think she has been an overlooked actress.  The actor who played the king was certainly handsome.  Well done job , all around.",1451088000,,468,4.2988505747126435

I've watched this movie every time it's aired on the Hallmark Channel this season (let's just say NUMEROUS times & each time is as enjoyable as the last).  Definitely one of my favorite Hallmark productions ever.  I enjoyed the film so much that I decided to go and purchase the DVD so that I can watch it in the years to come.  The story is wonderfully written..the acting is great (Danica McKellar is endearing, Rupert Penry-Jones is perfectly cast as the dashing king, Ellie Botterill is adorable as the little princess, and Pavel Douglas is equally wonderful)..and it is true family friendly entertainment. Kudos to Hallmark for producing such a wonderful film. I hope Hallmark considers doing a sequel of some kind in the future.  As mentioned in an earlier review, go to Walmart to purchase (where the DVD is under $10)...not sure why it's so much more here on Amazon.",1450051200,32,1007,4.825581395348837

Watch him on BBC stuff as well.  Waited to see this new Christmas Hallmark offering and was enthralled.  Danica did the sweetest job as well.  Don't want to reveal anything but what he said when the final kiss finally happened dashed me to the floor!!!  Watch it if you can.  I watched it twice but don't see it repeating again this year???  Hallmark must know when they have a good thing...",1449792000,,535,4.443298969072165
7555578,5,B018TNBX50,"This was a beautiful movie. Classic Hallmark Channel when you consider two unlikely people meet under odd circumstances and fall in love while others work to help the cause or stand between them. Great performances by all, especially Ellie Botterill, who makes her television debut in Crown for Christmas.

In some ways this is a modern retelling of The Sound of Music--minus six children and the singing. The cold King Maximilliam warms as he watches Allie and Theodora bond. Their relationship forces him to reconsider his duties and soften to become a better father.

A lovely setting, a great storyline, and fabulous costumes make this a must see holiday romance.

I watched this movie on Hallmark Channel. This review contains my honest opinions, which I have not been compensated for in any way.",1449619200,14,801,5.007518796992481
