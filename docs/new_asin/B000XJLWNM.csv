8600297,4,B000XJLWNM,"I bought this when I was in a very care free mood. I love vampire films and have probably seen every one of them (I'm a geek like that)

I started worrying that I had made a bad choice leading up to delivery date but I stuck with my gut feeling and watched the film

It was brilliant. It didn't do any more or less than what it said it did on the box - he's a pimp, he's a vampire, he's a Pimpula!!!

Some very nice bite scenes (quite a few of them) and even a girl on girl bite scene with no nudity but we all like to see a female vamp getting a girl...

If you take this movie light heartedly you will love it. Don't go in expecting a clean cut blockbuster hollywood production. It is grainy and the dialogue isn't Al Pacino standard, but who cares? A good film is a good film and I am a big supporter of low budget well thought out films

The actors/actresses do well with the film and script and the girls are pretty. The main actor pulls off the role well and probably enjoyed himself doing it too!!

Well done Pimpula - we can only hope for a sequel",1241136000,2,1055,3.976303317535545
