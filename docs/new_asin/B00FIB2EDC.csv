5993259,5,B00FIB2EDC,"I am the business partner of the son of Major Charles Kelly, Charles Kelly Jr.  Major Kelly was the first person killed in the history of Army Air Evacuation, known as ""Dustoff""...  I have become a student of a this part of history as my father was killed when I was two months shy of my fourth birthday.  I was only able to come to know my father better as I ready everything he wrote and met with many he served with.
This documentary exceeded my expectations as in the past other documentarians have gotten some of the story wrong or focused on one single aspect or mission.  This documentary is an accurate and moving portrayal of the entire history of Army Medevac.  I will say that I am not biased as I am critical of anything and everything that has been produced about the Dustoff story.  The producers had met me at the inactivation ceremony of the 57th Medical Detachment at Fort Bragg in 2007, as I was the keynote speaker.  I have never served in the military myself, but I have made it a point to dedicate time to the men and women of the Dustoff mission.  There are none better... If you get hurt or wounded on the battlefield, Dustoff is coming to get you and they will save your life if it is within their considerable capability.  Today, these UH-60 helicopters function like and emergency room in the sky and the crew members are truly trained and motivated to move and move fast when they are called to a mission.

8615897,5,B00FIB2EDC,"I had the pleasure of serving in a DUSTOFF unit... the 57th in fact. This documentary helped me to convey to my family what it meant to be a flight medic.

This movie portrays that bravery and sacrifice which also included that of the Dustoff chopper pilots and crew!

8615903,5,B00FIB2EDC,"As a two tour Dustoff pilot and unit commander, I found this DVD to be an excellent depiction of the US Army medical helicopter evacuation program in RVN. The discussion of the history of Dustoff is spot on....The scenes depicting the evolution of this mission in support of the conflicts in the middle east is well done.  For those wishing to explore this subject further, I recommend visiting the Dustoff Association website.",1427414400,2,427,4.930555555555555
8615904,5,B00FIB2EDC,"WOW!!!  Having been a Dustoff pilot from 1956 to 1970, this story tells it like it is.  Knowing most all of the ""older"" pilots shown, I can speak with authority that they did an outstanding job.  Flying 7-8 hours a day in Vietnam was pretty normal.  We did get the wounded.  I can't thank the folks this put this video together enough for  telling our story.  Thanks.  Dustoff 62 (My old call sign.)",1422057600,3,399,4.36986301369863
