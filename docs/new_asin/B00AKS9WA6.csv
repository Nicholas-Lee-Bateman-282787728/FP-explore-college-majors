5448247,5,B00AKS9WA6,Since B.R Chopra's Mahabharat this is the best program on Doordarshan and the subtitles make it easy to use for non Hindi speaking audience too. Loved it.,1369699200,2,154,4.7407407407407405
5448248,5,B00AKS9WA6,"This is essentially a collection of stories with themes from the Upanishads. The story begins with a young man (played nicely by Abhimanyu Singh of Gulal fame) questioning the validity of the Upanishads in the modern age and eventually understanding the timelessness of the Upanishadic virtues and translating them into street-play adaptations. Each episode can be seen by themselves but starting from the first one provides good perspective. The actor set is excellent from Abhimanyu Singh playing over 30 roles, Zakir Hussain (playing Ratnakar and Dara Shikoh)to Vrijesh Hirjee (Golmaal)playing Ashatavakra. Each episode is a beautiful pearl and the story collection is an exceptional chain of pearls necklace to have in ones' collection. Did I forget to mention that the spoken Hindi is as pure as it gets (There is subtitles for Non-Hindi speaking folks too).

Absolutely Loved it!",1359504000,6,885,5.366906474820144
