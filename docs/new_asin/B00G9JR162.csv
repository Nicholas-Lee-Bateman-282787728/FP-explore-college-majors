6068198,2,B00G9JR162,"I think this is probably one of the worst James Bond movies ever!  Incohesive plot lines and overall hard to follow script.  Not like any 007 movie I have seen.  (Spoiler) They even introduce Money Penney at the end of the movie.  What about all the other Bond movies her character was in?  I haven't seen the other one.  Perhaps it might be better, who knows?!",1387411200,,361,4.393939393939394

8621487,5,B00G9JR162,"QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a superior hard-edged James Bond film. Daniel Craig commands the screen with his strong visual presence and captivating aplomb as Ian Fleming's dedicated civil servant. Craig's interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond is that of man of few words, but whose mind never sleeps, ultimately to get the job done. He is a physically fit, brutally effective thinking man's Bond. He has a certain unfathomable charm and sardonic humor that makes him appealing to the opposite sex on screen and to the audience as well. The plot of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is character driven.

Looking at QUANTUM OF SOLACE closer, this film is really more of a study of James Bond and his world. This is very evident in Bond's scenes with Ren Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and then again with his scene with Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The tone of QUANTUM OF SOLACE is very dark and realistic. It is not a glamorous film as has been a hallmark of the series. It is a personal film. David Arnold's score once again continues to break new ground into Bond's hard-edged world. Arnold's ""What's Keeping You Awake"" is a very reflective piece and ""Field Trip"" is a real throwback to the classic Bond sound created by John Barry. I was glad to see that an actual Ian Fleming title was used for this film. I think this was rather fitting.

QUANTUM OF SOLACE has swept aside and maligned since the release of SKYFALL. QUANTUM OF SOLACE was the second film of the James Bond re-boot started with CASINO ROYALE. Somehow SKYFALL seemed to not follow the continuity after QUANTUM OF SOLACE where Bond was on the top of his game. Of the 3 Daniel this far, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is my favorite.

I suppose SKYFALL is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? It is starting to look as thought it is as the James Bond re-boot is in full swing again. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film in the traditional sense or is it? That is an interesting question. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film when I first saw it. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting, yet it is very introspective and thought provoking. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film, but that may have been the intent all along. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I think it is a good Bond film. Reflect on it I suppose. I still am. It may be one of the Classic Bonds. It just may be. SKYFALL was an event. Events are a rare thing.",1418342400,,3163,4.412671232876712
8621488,5,B00G9JR162,We really liked both movies.  Just what you expect from Bond.  We were very pleased to get two movies for such a good price.,1398297600,,124,4.125
8621489,5,B00G9JR162,"Excellent package deal, couldn't beat the price and Skyfall is def one of the best Bonds I've seen in awhile and the best Craig/Bond thusfar.

If you can find the package deal for cheap, def pick these up and add to your collection.",1395360000,,232,4.395348837209302

8621493,5,B00G9JR162,"Packaging: The movies come in separate cases, as if you're buying them separately.  Standard Blu-ray cases.

Movies: I personally love the new bond and feel Daniel Craig is the best.  I've seen all the 007 films many times and it's just a personal preference.  Connery made do with the technology and filming abilities at the time but it's hard to compete with modern 007.  The stunts, action, filming, and story are well paced and well done.  It takes some imagination as with any movie but I don't know anyone who did not enjoy watching either film.  Although they are not the masterpiece that was the Casino Royale remake, both are quality and worth the investment.

Cons: None",1391385600,,680,4.752136752136752
