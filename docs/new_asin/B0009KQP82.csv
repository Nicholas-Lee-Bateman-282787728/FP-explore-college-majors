8062775,4,B0009KQP82,A fun film that stimulates the mind and the heart.  Filled with irony and lighthearted humor this film is one of those that causes you to think about it intellectually days after having watched it.  Subtitles are a nice plus for those who are not fluent in its original language.  The movie keeps a nice steady pace without lagging.  It keeps you interested from start to finish.  Good acting and the set is also very well done.,1486425600,,428,4.5064935064935066

It made me laugh and also made me stop and think about... life, love, morals, marriage, good vs. evil.... and all the different perspectives that can be explored when debating over the said topics. Loved it in Spansh but translates very well in English too.",1212796800,,275,4.75

Experience it. It is an excellent film which memorably shows the difference between the life of the colorless and the life of the colored.",1210204800,,252,5.325
8062782,4,B0009KQP82,"This movie is one of a kind.  It centers on a town in Spain that is ""dying.""  We slowly learn some of the reasons for this, and the movie shifts from black and white to color to show the coming alive of the community.

This movie is stark and focuses on characters and dialogue.  It shows the conflicts and oddities of human nature and asks the questions:  What is sin?  What is charity? Who is truly good?  Is being truly good a form of vanity or pride? Fascinating stuff.  I enjoy movies by Spanish filmmakers for the way they look at human nature:  there's a wondrous juxtaposition of pragmatism and a romanticism that is not usually found in US films.

This film points to the way we as humans live -- sometimes comfortably, sometimes with resignation -- with contradications.",1131840000,4,780,4.546762589928058
8062783,5,B0009KQP82,"Nothing intellectual here, just some basic comments (am currently fighting off the flu).

I saw this on the shelf and sort of did a double take.  What?  The basic plot seemed so... ridiculous? weird?  I rented it out of curiosity mostly, but this film FAR exceeded my expectations as both a movie of great talent and beauty as well as some basic philosophical substance within a very simple, easy-to-follow-along-with movie that was quite a pleasure to watch.

It raised an interesting question - is the real ""sin"" the act of infidelity or the response of jealousy?  Are we too superficial and quick to condemn actions without evaluating their intentions..?

Although it made me think, it moreso touched my heart, and the movie lacks any sort of intellectual, philosophical discussion, which really adds to the depth and beauty of it.  It reminds me of the most basic tenet of creative writing: ""Show, don't tell.""",1131753600,2,914,4.928104575163399
8062784,4,B0009KQP82,"'Sexo por compasin' (COMPASSIONATE SEX) is a rare little film created in 2000 by Spanish director and writer Laura Ma that dares to address controversial issues of marital fidelity, the 'oldest profession in the world', the impotence of a Catholic priest in holding his community together, and the irresistible importance of physical discourse in mending misconceptions and misunderstandings. Quite a challenge taking on all of these topics, but Laura Ma has the skills to pull it off with the use of 'magical realism' and alluring cinematic knowledge and techniques. The final product is a joy!

The setting is a small village (either in Spain or Mexico, we are not told exactly) on the verge of dying due to the bland boredom and blanket sadness of the town folk, the lack of children being born and in general due to a languorous malaise. The film is shot not in black and white but varying shades of gray. Dolores (Elisabeth Margoni) is an overweight childless woman obsessed with doing good deeds for others, a fact that drives her husband Manolo (Jos Sancho) berserk, threatening that if Dolores is unable to come up with an act that demands his forgiveness he will abandon her. Dolores seeks advice from the village priest (Juan Carlos Colombo) in confessional, but the haughty padre is angered by the fact that Dolores daily visits the confessional with nothing to confess. He tells her to go out and sin and then he will be able to hear her confession!

Manolo leaves and the devastated Dolores is encouraged to move into the tavern owned by Floren (Mariola Fuentes) and with the loving advice of her friends she hears that the town is dying because the married couples are depressed. The sensitive Dolores hears from both the men and the women and under the pseudonym of Lolita, she invites the husbands to her new bed for free advice, consensual sex and enrichment. Lolita has discovered the source of the town's sadness and soon has slept with every man and keeps her free nurturing going while the women of the village marvel at how their husbands have changed for the better. At this point the town becomes alive, lovely, flowers grow, etc and the film is now in color.

Seeing the changes that have occurred drives the priest to build a cross and perform a ritual crucifixion! The women find Manolo and tell him how the town has changed and why - and the fact that all of the villagers consider Dolores/Lolita a saint. Manolo returns, is enraged, gathers the men together to convince them his wife is a prostitute and the town's life and joy return to the gray of black and white film. The women of the village are convinced that Manolo must be informed as to the sacrifice Lolita has been making and in order to do so they visit Manolo's humble house and line up for a toss in the hay with Manolo: after only several of the many women exit the house with smiles and gleams of physical satisfaction, Manolo weakly emerges admitting that such a process is indeed a sacrifice! How the village manages this mutual acceptance of Dolores and Manolo and incorporates the newfound 'therapy' into their lives constitutes the warmly humorous ending.

The large cast of actors is splendid. There are many cameos (Leocadia played by Leticia Huijara is a zany old lady who insists on photographing herself and the events of the village on a daily basis!, etc) and Laura Ma handles the direction of this potentially difficult story with amazing finesse. We can only hope she continues to create other films as unique and satisfying as SEXO POR COMPASION! Grady Harp, July 05",1121385600,14,3576,4.753623188405797
