Tom is back on his game.  I totally enjoyed the movie.",1277856000,2,103,3.6818181818181817
4021070,5,B002ZG986E,"My wife and I got a free ticket to attend one of three movies--""Predators,"" ""Knight And Day,"" or ""A-Team.""  It was a no-brainer.  I'll wait for the other two to come to DVD to partake in them.  My wife was fairly adamant about wanting to go and see ""Knight And Day"" right from the gate when the trailers were appearing here and there in different venues--internet, TV, DVD releases, what-have-you.  It looked to be a ton of fun, and, boy, was it ever!  There was so much wondering about what was really taking place as opposed to what was seen on the surface that it would be a bit difficult to explain it all here.  Let's just say that Tom's character, Roy Miller, may have been a good guy or a bad guy throughout the movie, we just simply don't know, which adds to the suspense...ten-fold.  His personality says he isn't, but his actions say otherwise.  All in all, through all the guessing and wondering what was truly going on, there was a bit of well-placed humor and an exceptional chemistry between Cameron and Tom.  They were having a ton of fun in the making of this movie, and it showed.  My wife made note that the trailers didn't show every bit of the good stuff, leaving nothing for the movie-going experience.  That was completely true.  This is not a movie for all the tight-a**, boring, nepotistic critics out there.  This one is for a great time out on a weekend and a soon-to-be great time on adult movie-night at home.  One more note: Mid to late teens would be fine with the subject matter of ""Knight And Day"" as well. LOTS O' FUN!!!",1277856000,93,1553,4.422535211267606
4021071,4,B002ZG986E,"This movie was a lot better than I had originally expected. It is filled to the brim with over-the-top action, suspense, and comedy. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were perfectly cast together. June Havens is on her way home, and literally bumps into Roy Miller at the airport. After they talk on the plane, June begins to like him, but she soon finds out that Roy is secret agent and doesn't take it too well. Roy is constantly following June in order to protect her from Agent Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald is after a perpetual energy battery called the Zephyr and will do whatever it takes to get it. I highly recommend KNIGHT AND DAY!!!",1277856000,7,630,4.584070796460177
4021072,5,B002ZG986E,"""Knight And Day"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A woman is caught between a covert agent and those he claims set him up. As their globetrotting adventure erupts into a maze of double-crosses, close escapes, false identities, and head-spinning romantic snafus, they come to realize that all they can count on is each other.

The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Roy Miller) & Cameron Diaz (as June Havens) is excellent! The directing by James Mangold (who also directed ""3:10 To Yuma"" (2007), ""Walk The Line"" (2005, also wrote the story and screenplay), ""Identity"" (2003), ""Kate & Leopold"" (2001, also wrote the screenplay), ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999, also wrote the screenplay) & ""Cop Land"" (1997, also wrote the story and screenplay) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Patrick O'Neill is excellent!

The music by John Powell (who also did the music to ""Green Zone"" (2010) & ""How To Train Your Dragon"" (2010), he also did the music to the upcoming ""Rio"" (2011) is excellent! The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who also did the cinematography to ""Identity"", ""Walk The Line"", ""3:10 To Yuma"", ""The Pursuit Of Happyness"" (2006) & ""W."" (2008) is excellent! The film editing by Michael McCusker (who also did the film editing to ""Walk The Line"", ""3:10 To Yuma"" & ""Australia"" (2008) & Quincy Z. Gunderson is excellent! The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting to ""Girl, Interrupted""), Sarah Katzman (both of did the casting to ""Identity"", ""Walk The Line"" & ""3:10 To Yuma"") & Donna DeSeta is excellent! The production design by Andrew Menzies (who also did the production design to ""3:10 To Yuma"", ""The Uninvited"" (2009) & ""The Crazies"" (2010), he was also an art director on ""Avatar"" (2009) is excellent! The art direction by Greg Berry (supervising art director) (who also did the art direction to ""Reign Over Me"" (2007), ""3:10 To Yuma"", ""Edge Of Darkness"" (2010) & ""The Crazies"") & Jeff Wisniewski (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Real Steel"" (2011) & ""The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn"" (2011), he was an assistant art director on ""Avatar"") is excellent! The set decoration by Jay Hart (who also did the set decoration to ""3:10 To Yuma"", ""Edge Of Darkness"", ""Date Night"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Machine Gun Preacher"" (2012) is excellent! The costume design by Arianne Phillips (who also did the costume design to ""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Identity"", ""Walk The Line"" & ""3:10 To Yuma"") is excellent!

This is an excellent action-comedy that is rare and original than most action-comedies of late. This is fun and entertaining. This is one of the best movies of the summer. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are excellent together.",1277596800,,2677,4.931263858093127
4021073,4,B002ZG986E,"Knight & Day is about a rogue agent (Tom Cruise) that hides a powerful battery in a normal woman named June's (Cameron Diaz) carry on case at an airport. He thought that would be it and he'd never see her again, but he finds himself having to protect her from the people he used to work with.

  The movie is just fun and it may be silly that Cruise and Diaz talk casually during shoot-outs but that's one of the things I enjoyed about the movie. The movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, just sit back and enjoy all the entertaining non-sense. Out of a so far lackluster summer season, Knight & Day is one of the better summer movies. Don't listen to the idiots on At the Movies, this is a fun flick and I highly doubt the Killers is a better movie like they said!",1277596800,137,768,4.175675675675675
4021074,3,B002ZG986E,"Tom Cruise plays the extremely charming Roy Miller, an agent whose colleagues (led by Viola Davis and Peter Sarsgaard) believe has gone rogue. Roy has the device, codename Zephyr, that the federal agents and arms dealers are looking for, the thing that will change the world.  We're never really sure *how* exactly, but just go along - it will.  Roy also knows where the quirky genius (Paul Dano) who developed the technology is hiding, and if you can't find the Zephyr, the young scientist is the next best thing.

Cameron Diaz plays the car restoring June Havens, a carefree lady who's just trying to get home but unwittingly gets caught up in Roy's world.  Cruise and Diaz are at least believable together - the chemistry between them is palpable.

It's an around-the-world chase with stops in Austria, Spain, and Jamaica. As expected, there is plenty of action: hand-to-hand battles, gunfire galore, explosions, bulls, planes, trains, and automobiles.  Whew!  Apparently, more time was taken with producing the great action scenes than with developing a strong storyline, and the movie has quite a few holes in it and many unrealistic bits.  For example, June ""hasn't been anywhere and doesn't even have a passport,"" but Roy is able to move her freely about from country to country at will.  Also, there are many shoot-out scenes with bullets flying everywhere, from the weapons of professionals who apparently know how to shoot, but our hero and heroine are never harmed, except for one ""scratch"".  I know, I know - it's Hollywood...

Besides the action, another saving grace is all the comedy in the movie, with many of the laughs delivered by Cruise in an over-the-top, yet controlled psychotic manner.  Really well done.  And did I mention charming?  In the middle of one gun battle, he still finds the time to compliment Diaz on her dress.

This movie will not win any best picture awards, but if you're a fan of Cruise and/or Diaz, if you like action flicks, and if you're OK with the holes in the story and can just enjoy it for pure entertainment's sake, I think you will like this movie.  I did enjoy it and I give it three out of five stars.",1277510400,2,2155,4.752688172043011
4021075,4,B002ZG986E,"This movie calls out for a steamy summer day when the theater's air conditioning is half the reason to go. It offers pretty much everything a silly-season movie watcher (or parents of same) could want: guns'n'chases, bloodless violence, a chaste romantic theme and, at least in the last fifteen minutes, a nice role reversal with a girl-power touch.

The plot (such as it is) features Tom Cruise dragging Diaz's small-town character from her supporting role in Boston wedding through the seamy side of Europe's black-market arms trade. Somehow, her hayseed character and his boyscout cheerfulnes never waver, even during running gun battles with unspecified bad guys. C'mon, you didn't come for the credibility, did you?

Set your expectations properly, and it's a fine bit of commodity entertainment.

4021076,5,B002ZG986E,"When we first saw the trailer for ""Knight & Day"" in a theatre many moons ago we decide this was a movie we wanted to see the first day when it came out.  It had been a long time since a trailer got us this excited, probably since ""Titanic,"" where we wanted to know how Kate Winslet survived given she was on the bow of the great ship as it sank beneath the waves (this being a separate issue from ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Dark Knight,"" where we do not need to see no stinkin' trailer to be convinced to go see the movie).  But having been burned time and time again by great trailers for lousy movies, we were worried that we had already seen all of the best laughs for this summer of 2010 film.  Happily, that is most decidedly not the case.  Therefore, let the news be spread, that ""Knight and Day"" is a film that is at least as good as the trailer, and I would argue even better.

June Havens (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cameron-Diaz/dp/B001OQCV1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cameron Diaz</a>) is running through an airport to make a connection to get back home to Boston for her sister's wedding, when she bumps not once, but twice, into Roy Miller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Cruise/dp/B00005JN2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Cruise</a>).  The next thing she knows they are two of the handful of people on a flight that is supposedly totally booked.  June likes the way the conversation is going and retires to the restroom to decide how far she wants things to go.  By the time she comes out, June and Roy are the only two people left alive on the plane.  Who is Roy and why are people trying to kill him?  Oh, that would be telling and the whole point of the hook is to get you into the theatre.  If I were to describe ""Knight & Day"" in terms of movie algebra I would say it is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Lies/dp/B00026ZG10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Lies</a>"" crossed with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Up-Baby/dp/B0007TKNCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Up Baby</a>,"" because this is as much a screwball comedy as it is a spy on the run movie.  The title is really just a cute variation on a natural opposition, and you will be most of the way through the film before it halfway makes sense, but it never makes complete sense, so do not get hung up on it.

Cruise spends a lot of time wearing sunglasses and working them hard, so he has the whole ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Risky-Business/dp/B0018QPPXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Risky Business</a>"" vibe going in this one, but this is also the funniest he has ever been in a film and he does it with nary a smirk.  As for Diaz, this is far and away the best work she has done in a comedy, especially when she is doing more than supplying just the voice.  I even think she does a better job here than she did in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-John-Malkovich/dp/B00007AJF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being John Malkovich</a>,"" which is usually the film people point to when they want to cite Diaz's best work (as Roy says in the film, the lady has ""skills"").  Both stars get equal credit for keeping their characters anchored despite the over the top elements of the film, and that goes a long way towards make their on-screen chemistry work so well.  More importantly, we are talking about personal chemistry rather than sexual chemistry, because they convince us there is a real connection between two people who appear to be as opposite as, well, night and day.  Of course, that is not totally the case, another reason for the chemistry.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Sarsgaard/dp/B002ONC9NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Sarsgaard</a>&nbsp;is the good guy chasing Roy and Jordi Moll the head bad guy doing the same.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Viola-Davis/dp/B002XMGGK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Viola Davis</a>&nbsp;is the no nonsense boss and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Dano/dp/B001AR4K62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Dano</a>&nbsp;the reason why Roy and June are in all the trouble.  For that matter, nobody else in the film engages in chewing scenery either, which works out nicely because there are plenty of bullets and flying cars to take care of ripping the scenery to shreads.

The screenplay is by Patrick O'Neill, who apparently started out in Hollywood as a bit actor in films like ""Say Anything"" and ""Grosse Point Blanke,"" and then wrote and produced the short lived 2001 television series ""Dead Last.""  Given that resume, I am curious as to how much of what we see on screen is O'Neill's creation and how much is due to the actors and director James Mangold (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma/dp/B000XR9L50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma</a>"").  But we will have to wait for O'Neill's next screenplay to get a better idea of what he contributes.  It has been a long time since we laughed out loud this much (and this loud) at a movie, and there is just a lot of fun and a sense of joy permeating this film.  I especially liked the escape where June comes in and out of consciousness and we get fleeting glimpses of the insanity Roy is up to.  I know that a lot of the action sequences are done with special effects these days, but even with that consideration I liked how a lot of the ""stunts"" were grounded in such old school classics as the car chase and the gunfight.  I hope that one of my favorite bits, which consists of simply creating a traffic jam by doing a quick circle, was done by an actual stunt driver and not on computers, because that would make it even more impressive.

But this film boils down to Cruise and Diaz, and they are well worth the price of admission.  This is not mere hyperbole on my part, because we went to see this movie at night, something we rarely, rarely do, and on top of that we ordered tickets on line to make sure we got in, which was an additional expense.  So I think we ended up paying more to see ""Knight and Day"" than any other movie we have ever seen in a theatre (No, we have not seen a 3-D movie, an IMAX movie, or an IMAX 3-D movie, and paying to see a live HDTV broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera does not count as a movie).  I am not sure if this is a great movie, because I have to see it again to render a verdict on how well it holds up the second time through.  But to have such high expectations met and exceeded like this certainly justifies rounding up.",1277337600,,6806,5.274074074074074

4021935,5,B002ZG986E,"Here's the thing: this movie makes no sense. Here's the other thing: it's not really trying to. In fact, it's actively trying NOT to. Knight and Day is a spoof on every other Tom Cruise movie ever, and most action movies. It takes all the parts of these movies that don't make sense, squishes them into one movie, and then points and laughs at them. And it does it really, really well. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are unusually delightful and make a surprisingly good couple, which is a plus. If you've seen action movies and enjoyed pointing out the plot holes, then this movie will be hysterical. If you're looking for a movie that takes itself seriously at all, maybe try the Bourne movies again. That's just not what this is going for.",1500854400,,739,4.522388059701493

She played helpless a little too much, but Tom Cruise off set that in a good way.  Jordi Molla was too much like BadBoys 2 role..but I felt..the action was fun..the cat and mouse ..the Dano end of the story..Maybe it was too James Bond like..but at the same time.>I like Tom Cruise Role..he was Good Crazy..Sure some people are sick of him..I still think he has his A game going on. I would like to see how The Mummy revamp is going to be. It would be cool to see Tom Cruise in a crazy Horror comedy.. Cameron Diaz has shown some action skills that should be noted. Peter Sarsgaard was okay..I don't think this movie showed off his acting chops..I like him in Garden State . Gal Gadot defines sexy for the few seconds she was in it. Viola Davis..Please give that woman a different kind of role..she is skilled and type cast as heck..

The movie was entertaining but on the same token it was lacking in drawing me in.

I watched it simply because it was something to watch but it didn't have me totally engaged.

The story line had some gaps in it for me... like why was Roy an asset and how did that come about? Some of the backstory was left out and would have made a huge difference if that information had been made known.

It was entertaining...and you've got a couple hours to kill.... it's worth a one time viewing",1474329600,,601,4.2

What's great about Cruise films is that you can feel secure in knowing that Hollywood's obsession with sleeze and filth won't find it's way into his films. He's pretty good about keeping them out.

4023365,5,B002ZG986E,"Is this movie silly? Will you have to basically forget that disbelief even exists? Yes.
Is it incredibly fun, clever, and worth seeing? Also yes!
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are both incredibly charismatic actors, and they bring this charisma full on to this film. Add to that gorgeous locations, fun action sequences, and a fast-moving (thought not particularly credible) plot, and you have a good way to spend a couple hours. This is a great date / netflix & chill movie because everyone will find something to enjoy in it. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are both likable and share an easy rapport. His chemistry with her isn't the powerful, palpable sexual one he has with Rebecca Ferguson in the latest Mission Impossible movie. But it is friendly and effortless. Cameron Diaz in particular is enjoyable. She does a great job showing the bewilderment and fear of a normal person who gets caught up in crazy circumstances. And while she does need to get rescued many times and spends much of the movie dragged around by the hero (not something I enjoyed), she does have some smarts of her own and eventually grows into someone who is just as kick ass as him. The humor in the film is clever and light-hearted, but there are also nice, intimate moments for the two leads where you can see the unexpected depth in the characters. You can especially sense a wistfulness in Cruise's character, a longing for a life he has missed. There is no deep drama here, but just enough substance to give the characters an extra dimension.
Fun, enjoyable, and a movie that both men and women will like. Recommended.",1467590400,10,1599,4.693950177935943

Not the most suspenseful movie you'll ever see. Entertaining and fast moving, yes. Suspenseful - no.
Really, can Tom Cruise not stop being a hunk? Can Cameron Diaz stop being hot?
There are so many things I love about this movie, and they pretty much all come to the surface in the trailer. Blam! Boom! Speeding planes and motorcycles. This is one of Cameron Diaz's best roles because she brings sexy to the screen without revealing that she is, never to escape this, one of Charlie's Angels wherever she goes.
Tom Cruise is always going to be The Man. Here, he's his usual confident soft-spoken self, with a big gun.

I search and search for a good well balanced movie ... tv series ... and after ten year of going from an athlete / bungee jumper etc... to being a bed-bound - high spirited, mostly sci fi geek.  I came across this movie ... it is was fun, exciting and sweet all at the same time ..(I'm not usually big on ""sweet"" or ""sappy"" - . This movie is hard to place in a category.... as a rule,  I don't usually go for most romantic comedies or the constant car chase - shoot'em up movies ... or horror movies ...or politically charged movies... so finding something for me is tough.  I'm a sci-fy geek mostly ... with a little Top Gun / MI / and Downton Abbey thrown in from time to time... but THIS had a little bit of almost  everything to keep me entertained without rolling my eyes like the snob I can be with movies.... while it will not win any major awards ... it helped me forget about my physical pain for a while....  I'm not even a huge Tom Cruise fan ... but have liked his MI series and other similar films such as the M.D. series: Borne Identity ... This ended up being so much better than I thought.  Really.  I don't write a lot of reviews ... but this one I had to... it distracted me from horrible physical pain and very few movies can detracted me from that  kind of suffering.  I was in a bad/sad mood when I started watching it and then enjoyed myself.  I only wish I would have purchased this one from instant video instead of renting.

And drugs her - several times. Yes, Roy is a spy. That much is obvious. But has he gone rogue, like June has been told? Who does she trust as she gets pulled deeper and deeper into Roy's cat and mouse game. Seriously, I didn't expect a lot when I rented this movie online, but I ended up enjoying it immensely. I want to get my hands on the DVD, so I can watch it again and again!",1440633600,,757,4.338028169014085

Since that everyone includes the pilot, they have a problem. Roy does his best to land the plane, but it couldn't be called anything but a (barely) controlled crash.

Which pretty much describes the rest of the movie. It's one gigantic controlled, slow-motion, never-ending crash, with a mystery (is Roy the bad guy, or a good guy caught in a bad situation? and what the heck is going on?), a romance, and just about everything you can think of.

4026809,4,B002ZG986E,"I've got to admit, I'd heard bad things about Knight and Day almost from the start.  No one seemed to think it would be good, so I wrote it off.  Then I saw the first preview, and it looked like fun.  So I decided to take a chance and actually watch it.

June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is trying to get back home to Boston as quickly as possible.  She's thrilled when she is able to get on an earlier flight, especially when it seems that the flight is mostly empty.  She begins talking to Roy Miller (Tom Cruise), a man she literally bumped into a couple times before boarding the flight.

Then things take a turn toward the unexpected.  While June is in the bathroom, everyone on the plane except Roy is killed.  He tells her some story about agents coming to question her before she passes out from drugs.  Next thing she knows, she is home.  And then the agents come and start questioning her.  Is Roy a good guy or a bad guy?  Who should she trust?  And what has she stumbled into?

Now, if you are going into this movie looking for a serious action adventure, turn around, walk out, and get your money back before the show even starts.  This is pure fun action.  Part of that is just because the movie is a comedy.  Some of the lines are pretty funny, and how June reacts to situations makes much of the movie work as well.

But even the action doesn't take itself too seriously.  Don't get me wrong, I got that adrenalin rush at those scenes.  But how they were getting out of those situations was pretty unbelievable.  Frankly, I felt like the film was winking at us.  Instead of saying, ""Look at this cool stuff that is really happening,"" it said, ""Look at us having fun.  Doesn't this look cool even if we both know it could never happen.""  As I say, I enjoyed the scenes, but I never took them that seriously.

Having said that, the spy plot part of things does pretty much hold together.  I can't really think of any major plot holes.  It progressed from one point to the next very logically, taking me along for the ride.

And the cast was perfect.  It pretty much falls to Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to hold things together, and they do very well at it.  Cameron Diaz especially is perfect as the ordinary woman caught up in a world she is not used to at all.  Frankly, I could identify with her reactions to things most of the time.

I know that they put the best parts of the movie in the previews, and unfortunately that once again held mostly true here.  There were some pretty funny scenes late in the film I hadn't seen in the ads.  However, the movie wasn't quite the action movie or the comedy I expected.  Heck, even the romance could have been developed more.  What was here definitely worked.  It could have just used more of it.  My roommate was also expecting it to be funnier, although we both agreed that the comedy scenes were pretty funny.

Knight and Day doesn't take itself too seriously.  As long as you sit down with the same expectations, you'll have a great time.",1430870400,,2997,4.327927927927928

4026975,5,B002ZG986E,"This was my first time renting a movie through Amazon. I loved this movie - however my ability to play the movie was so horrible we were not able to really truly enjoy it. The movie itself timed out about every 3 minutes, and this is no exaggeration. We play Netflix movies and Amazon prime movies just fine on our TV. We only had issues with this PAID movie. At one point, I just walked away and did something else and let it go through all the stops and starts by itself. Interestingly enough, once we had ""played"" through it once with all the stops and starts, we were able to play it through without any issues the 2nd time. Almost as if once it was in memory it had no issues playing.

I'm not sure I'll rent a video through Amazon again for this reason although Amazon did take care of us regarding this playback issue.",1428364800,,825,4.254777070063694

Cruise is the perfect boy scout, inhumanly capable as a troubleshooter, protective of others, and far more than a match for the Bad Guys, of whom there are many.  Diaz is a tough, capable restorer of old cars who gets caught up in Cruise's lunatic situation and only gradually catches up with what's happening.  The ending is very satisfying, and be sure not to miss the credits scene: it resolves a lingering bit of sadness.",1422662400,,598,4.766990291262136

4028955,4,B002ZG986E,"I was surprised that I found this film enjoyable because Cruise and Diaz usually trigger my gag-reflex.  However... the script is so simple and the characters are so charming that it was like a children's comic book.  The writers knew the limitations of their actors and worked around them - producing simple, goofy dialogue to fill in the spots between special effects and chase scenes.  Diaz's character is a bit ditsy, as expected, but she isn't useless.  It is wholly believable that she would have the skill to rebuild old cars, which gives her the confidence/chutzpah to be an active participant in the action scenes: driving like a maniac or improvising escapes from Bad Guys.  No sappy romantic scenes, just a hint of snappy innuendo, which was believable for these two weird characters.  Dialogue and plot remind me of Disney - simple and hilarious.  The portrayal of Cruise's parents was like watching a kitten trying to remove a piece of tape from its paw:  hilarious, sweet, and makes-you-say ""awww...""",1413504000,2,1014,4.958579881656805

4029318,2,B002ZG986E,"Thankfully, on Oct. 2nd we shall have one! To be fair, there are things about this movie that are good. The action is first rate, and considering his age Mr. Cruise does a tremendous job with the stunts. Ms. Diaz is an excellent driver. However, this movie is like flat champagne! Nothing special, and rather annoying, because you're expecting a party, and you get a nap.

Don't get me wrong. I fully endorse the entertainment of a Summer Blockbuster! I don't need a coherent plot as long as I have charming characters, and action. Movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhoom-2-Bollywood-Movie/dp/B0016GOJYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhoom 2: Bollywood Movie</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Mrs-Smith-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000AP04FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the Fast and the Furious franchise are some of my favorite ways to escape mundane reality!

However, the caveat is simply this... Those movies have charming characters and a tongue-in-cheek humor. They always have a wink and a nod. They laugh at themselves! This movie is an out-and out comedy, but I wasn't laughing!

Why? Mr. Cruise (as much as I dislike him) forgot to bring his cheekiness to the role. It really irks me that someone who does to charm, quirk, and cheeky so well, was utterly flat! He has a better sense of humor in Mission Impossible! Here he came off as a sociopath with emotional disorders!

Ms. Diaz I am also not a fan of, but I also think she can pull off endearing and charming in roles. Here, she plays a blond ditz! I'm sorry, there is no other way to say it! How many times did she do something completely stupid? Up until the last five minutes! It wouldn't have been so bad if they were different mistakes, but she kept doing the same stupid thing, over and over again!

As for romantic chemistry... I'm drawing a blank.

A lot of reviews praised the pacing of the movie, but it felt like a CD stuck on repeat of the worst song on the album. I was thinking, ""Come on we just did this ten minutes ago let's move!""

Speaking of music, the soundtrack is utterly unimpressive. I found it dull and lifeless like the rest of the movie.

Even the locations aren't made use of! Come on! You have the Orient Express, gorgeous cities in Europe, and finally somewhere in South America and NONE of their glory was captured! Okay the Island was nice!

Oh, and for the record the villains are BORING and what they did to Viola Davis is CRIMINAL!

All in all, I am so happy that Bollywood got a crack at this. The soundtrack is already amazing. There will be color, there will be gorgeous locations, there will be charm, there will be amusing villains, there will be SOUL! POP the champagne and go BANG BANG! It will be a party.",1411948800,,2855,5.05531914893617

4029998,3,B002ZG986E,"Ah  the summer action movie. A time for filmmakers to ask How many crazy stunts
and one-liners can we jam into 2 hours? Knight and Day attempts to up the ante, and
sadly there is nothing new about it.
The film follows Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz as they pretty much go from action
sequence to action sequence. Tom is (or is not) a spy being hunted by some generic
people for some generic reason. The action is inventive a few times, but overall it falls
flat.
I like Tom Cruise. I think Jerry Maguire is great  A Few Good Men is amazing, and
watching the Mission Impossible films is always fun. But he is an actor who is the same
in every movie. How long can he keep up the Hey  Im smiling and I got everything
covered, persona? It would be more interesting to see him in a slightly more vulnerable
role, rather than always having to be on top of everything.
As I was writing this review, I thought the title sounded familiar. And then it hit me. The
Pixar animated short shown before Toy Story 3 is actually titled Day & Night. It is about
2 personifications of day and night  complete opposites and yet they discover how
similar they are. And guess what? The 6 minute short, Day & Night was more
inventive, entertaining and thoughtful than the almost 2 hours of Knight and Day.
Tom Sundance Sims adds: Sorry, Knight and Day isn't even on my list to see. I
would urge everyone to just go and see Toy Story 3 again. Worth two trips! And I am
also going to urge everyone to join us this Friday night, July 2, 7:00 p.m. for a free
screening of our summer film camp movies! Its going to be a great night of films (and
you can meet the Young Filmmakers who made them!).",1408406400,,1665,4.226415094339623
4029999,4,B002ZG986E,"I'm not a fan of most Action/Comedies and although I own over 1500 dvds less than 15 are action/comedy. But after seeing Knight and Day on TV I bought this one. Cruise is his usual Mission Impossible self and I truly like that character. Ms. Diaz fits in nicely without playing the really dumb blond type of role. The flow of the storyline is probably what I liked most and add to that the locations for the action sequences (planes, cars, Islands, etc.).",1408320000,,455,4.493975903614458

It was the most hilarious, well done, chocked full of memorable ""one-liners"" that have had me and my family laughing ever since we first saw the movie years ago. I consider this to be the best Tom Cruise movie ever. Stunts were awesome, Cameron Diaz was perfect... the chemistry between them was indescribably sweet.
Recently showed it to a friend who had never seen it, and he was so enthused I could hear him muttering, ""Is this the best movie ever, or what!""  ""How come I've never heard of this movie?""
Get it, watch it, hang on for a non stop flow of action. It's like a cross between a real action thriller, and a comedy... It's like a parody of the super spy movies...a comedy version of Borne Identity.  Not meant to be an actual representation of spy business. There is a little gore, and a little mature conversation that would cause some to not want their little children to see it. One F bomb...",1408320000,,959,4.4124293785310735

It's not going to win any awards or anything and I did find the molestation scene (where he changed her into a bikini without her consent) was really offensive and annoying.  I'm just tired of all these movies acting like it's cute when a guy sexually harasses a woman.  In Leap Year Amy Adams finds it 'adorable' when the guy who stole her items tries to sneak a peak at her naked... In American Pie when the student is recorded having sex without her knowing it's 'funny'... I mean really when will it end?

But overall the film was funny.  Tom Cruise plays a guy who's off his rocker and June eventually seems to be fine with the fact that he's not completely sane.  The movie isn't very realistic at all, but it's a fun ride.",1407888000,2,757,4.333333333333333

In the original, you see Day, the character played by Cameron Diaz, in a junkyard removing the parts she uses for her restorations. In this version it opens up with Knight, the character played by Tom Cruz, walking in the airport giving passengers the eye over. You have no idea why Day is struggling with a heavy case  until she gets to the inspectors. They also cut out an important fight scene in the train kitchen, most of Day's wedding scene, and her sister's speech, at her sister's wedding, and a number of smaller scenes that really add to the flow and continuity of the movie.

4030475,5,B002ZG986E,"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times since my sister recommended it. It's one of those movies that one enjoys over and over again. Why? Here's my list of reasons why:
1. The actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Both are immensely likeable whether or not you approve of their lives outside the movie house. However, I surmise, right or wrong, that they did not particularly like each other as themselves. If I'm right, that means their acting is quite convincing because they do have chemistry in this film.
2. The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the movie. It is violent but not violent. So many bullets fly around Tom's character, yet he is not hit until the end (not giving anything away).
3. The title is a play on words. The knight hides the battery (see the movie to understand the inference). The day that may or may not come.
4. Very few curse words fly; in fact, each time I hear one I am reminded of how few there are.
5. The comedy is delightful. I love every line each character has. My favorites: ""With me. Without me."" ""Someday means never. It never comes."" ""This is Someday, Roy."" Oh, yes, the words about undressing her. Ha ha. The best humor comes with the turn-about is fair play thing.
6. Good guys win. I mean REALLY win, as in double winning with the special ending.
7. Special ending, very unexpected, but totally right.

oh, and the movie is great too. great plot, great acting, great story line. not a lot of effects to make it seem fake or phony... it's one of my favorites... a great blend of stuff i like and stuff girls like so i can watch it with my lady and not have to hear a lot of blah blah blah over wanting to watch something different.",1388966400,,634,4.239669421487603

4031130,4,B002ZG986E,THIS MOVIE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I THOUGHT CAMERON DIAZ WAS ESPECIALLY GOOD. TOM CRUISE WAS HIS USUAL GOOD GUY.,1388448000,,136,4.956521739130435

While it borders a bit on fantasy, it's an opportunity to take a break from the daily routine.  Cruse and Diaz are terrific actors and they compliment  each other perfectly.  The Knight and Day DVD is a great addition to any video collection.  A Handsome man and Attractive woman are a perfect combination for this video.  The audio portion of this video adds even more 'thrills'.",1386633600,,486,4.783132530120482

I must admit I was surprised I'd like it because I hadn't been that much into Tom Cruise movies after the Scientology fiasco and the Katie Holmes break up but I found it to be full of excitement, action and comedy along with semi-romance. Those who don't like it is because they're not understanding the Action/ Adventure Comedy gist of the film. It's not a movie designed to be analyzed. "" How could he not be shot when all those bullets are flying his way. There's no way a couple would want to get busy kissing as bullets are flying towards their direction."" Uh you think?

You can't just hit ""play"" to get to the movie, you have to go through all these screens and questions.  Even after months have passed, and even if we've cycled the power to the player itself several times, this disk still brings me right back to where I left off months ago.  No other blu-ray disk we own is this annoying.  Note to blu-ray maker - if I press ""play,"" that means I want to play the disk, not be asked if I want to continue a few minutes later.

Cameron plays kind of a dipsy tomboyish girl next door who finds herself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person. The rest is the government chase scenes and some fun action scenes that may not be very believable in this spy/espionage action movie, but keeps it moving at a fast pace.

4031509,5,B002ZG986E,"For the record, I am not a Tom Cruise fan!  That being said, I absolutely loved him and Cameron Diaz in this movie.  Knight and Day is both action adventure and comedy.  Cameron Diaz can come across as the ditzy blond better than anyone, and then turn around and prove that she is anything but a ditzy blond.  These two came across with such a chemistry that you would believe they had been together for years.  The stunts that Tom does are great, not outrageous as in a number of his other movies.  Again Cameron jumps right in with her portion of the stunts and makes you think of her as a professional stunt women as well.
You can't go wrong with this movie, it doesn't try to be the perfect action flick, nor does it try to be a strict comedy, which is why Knight and Day is such a fun and entertaining movie to watch!",1379980800,,822,4.203821656050955
4031510,5,B002ZG986E,". . . But Cruise and Diaz pull it off chaotically. A lot of slapstick - not my favorite comedy genre - with the Harry met Sally boy meets girl gaffes to appeal to quicker viewers. In all, a surprising mix of mayhem and stunts and maybe an obnoxious portrayal
of Diaz as a seeming ding-a-ling (but that running joke is eventually blown away by CD's character as smarter than she seemed to be).

I'd seen K&D before at a friend's home, liked it, so bought the DVD to re-see on occasion. Its humor never fails
to amuse or its action  titillate. It sure seems Cruise does many of the  precarious stunts, and they're pretty edgy.

I like movies that I can see, enjoy, put away and come back in awhile and see again with that 'see again for the first=time feeling.

KNIGHT & DAY pulls that trick off. So far, for me, three times so far . . .",1379980800,3,835,4.19375

I wonder if they'll come up with a sequel to this starting where they left off. I think it could have great potential if they were to do so. In the movie they make a great couple.

When I first saw scenes of Knight and Day when it was in the theaters I thought, ""what is Cruise doing?""  Then..I saw it on television.

This movie, much like all other Tom Cruise movies, is made infinitely enjoyable and repeatedly watchable due to Tom Cruise's movie-making brillance.  This movie simply will not disappoint - assuming the viewer has a pulse.",1377216000,,532,4.877777777777778

4031681,5,B002ZG986E,The flirtatiousness between Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise can only be described as a playful cat and mouse. And the best part(s) of the movie is how secret agent Tom Cruise manages to keep Cameron Diaz high the ENTIRE way through.,1377043200,,228,4.585365853658536
4031682,4,B002ZG986E,"The only one in the movie that I've seen before is Tom Cruise; therefore, no comparison with other films can be made for other performers. About all that can be said about them is that they served as suitable foils for The Star. On the other hand, I was a little surprised that Cruise managed the light touch as well as he did. It seems to me that he has not previously done the Doug Fairbanks, Senior and Junior, Cary Grant, gay, daring-do with same panache. He handled it pretty well, not up there with the Masters, but more than adequate for the demands of this movie. The female lead, Diaz, serves mostly as a foil for Cruise, although this being a 21st Century film, she was given her segment in which to shine.
The plot was not only forgettable once the film was over, it barely existed while the film was unwinding (to use  an old pre-digital adage). I know a number of people were paid what, to me, is megabucks, to put something down on  paper to give the actors words to say and things to do; however, the instructions to them might as well have been, don't worry about it, just listen to the Director while he makes it up. The result was mostly incomprehensible and incoherent. Never mind, you will never miss it.
My advice: if you are in the mood for light and airy, sometimes humorous, well staged fight and other action scenes, this is a good one. It also fits the occasions when you really don't want to try to make sense of what is going on, just want to watch lots of 'let's pretend' stuff.
This fits the bill. I enjoyed it without ever figuring out, ""Who's on First"".",1376956800,,1585,4.351351351351352

It's full of twists and turns in the plot, can't say they keep you guessing, because you know what's up. It has loads of ""laws of physics be damned"" chase scenes, traveling to exotic locations all over the world, and shooting scenes where the main character doesn't get hit once, but everybody else is turned into hamburger. Cruise looks incredible. And there is a great deal of chemistry between him and Diaz. Wouldn't list it as a movie classic, but it's loads of fun.

4031839,4,B002ZG986E,"I've seen this movie both on FX and amazon instant video. The movie itself: I *love* it (in fact, I purchased the blu ray, even though I've seen it multiple times). It's witty and reminds me of the reasons that we all fell in love with Tom Cruise before he went crazy. There are some great one-liners (""I've been trained to disarm a ticking bomb with only a safety pin and a Junior Mint. I'm pretty sure I could change your clothes without, um, looking. I'm not saying that that's what I did, but I could."") It's not gonna win any Oscars, but it's fast-paced, funny, and all-around entertaining.

As much as I love the movie, though, I'm a little disappointed in the Amazon Instant Video version. It's not the extended cut, so several of the action scenes are shorter, and some of the less-central plot issues are cut out, for instance conflict between June and her sister. I'm not sure if it's common for amazon to use the shorter version, but after seeing it on FX and looking forward to some entertaining action moves, etc, the edited version was a bummer - and the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5.

Rent it. Better yet, buy the DVD/Blu Ray with the extended version.",1375228800,2,1178,4.449074074074074

4032411,5,B002ZG986E,"Diaz and Cruise are a good combination, which must be why they've made several movies together.  It was a typical Cruise action film but with more humor mixed in.  I rented this movie a couple of times and ended up buying the DVD so I could watch it more times.  There is something about this movie that charms me.  Unlike most of Cruise's action films, it shows a tender side of the man.  The yearning his character expresses to do some of the things he has always wanted to do impressed me as being not too far off from Cruise's real desire--not that he needs any more excitement in his life, but that his life is mostly about work and not that much play or relationship.  Diaz's character is a perfect foil for Cruise's capable and in-control Roy Miller, because she goes into hysterics at the drop of a hat and responds on impulse most of the time rather than thinking things through.  There is an essential underlying sweetness to the movie despite all the action and shooting.  Diaz and Cruise do a great job of being funny together, and both give somewhat nuanced performances in this film.  Diaz goes from being winsome to being flirtatious, hysterical, jealous, fearful, and more.  Cruise's character is the super-controlled, extremely skilled agent who thinks five steps ahead and fearlessly puts himself in harm's way, but he is also gentle and caring at times and funny at others.  Although much of what he does is implausibly perfect, there are moments where he seems to let down his guard and show his softer side.  I think that is why I like him in this film so much.  After probably at least 6 views, I still like the movie and I know I will watch it again many more times.  Plus I absolutely adore the ""Someday"" number at the end by the Black-Eyed Peas.  I recommend this movie.  It's a fabulous action-packed romp if you like action films, and it's also a cute comedy at the same time.  The romance between Cruise's and Diaz's characters is infused with humor instead of heavy emotionality, so even guys should be okay with it.  I think Cruise's comedic abilities are often overlooked when they cast him in films, but he gets to exercise them a bit in this one, and it adds just that delicious touch of humor that makes his character likeable without descending into the ridiculous slapstick of action film spoofs.  I think most people will find it definitely worth at least one view, and it's now on my ""favorites"" shelf.",1369872000,,2440,4.580645161290323

4032413,5,B002ZG986E,I am not much of an action only watcher. Their are too many supreme impossibilities they add into action to hide the fact there is no plot.

It starts out a bit slow but when Tom enters the scene all hell breaks lose and the adventure never stops.  I had to buy the dvd and since I've purchased it I have watched it on those late nights when my husband is tired and I get to take over the controls and the television.  A glass of wine some hot popcorn and I'm entertained until I, too, am ready to catch some shut eye.

The casting didn't work for me. Like Madonna playing Evita (an intensely ambitious woman seeking power through success in show business playing an intensely ambitious woman seeking power through show business), Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are playing parts that have been so force-fed to us that I found myself bucking against them instead of rooting for them. ""Cameron Diaz is gorgeous but lovable!"", yells ""There's Something About Mary,"" screams ""Charlie's Angels,"" rants every other Cameron Diaz movie. ""Tom Cruise is a relentless, confident action hero,"" hollers every single ""Mission Impossible,"" shout ""Oblivion,"" ""Jack Reacher"" and every other movie he's ever made. Yeah, yeah, yeah I get it, I'm supposed to empathize with them, I'm supposed to love Cameron's character, I'm supposed to stand in awe of his character.

Unappetizing to say the least......................... Disgusting at worst!  They have done much better in other films.  I guess they needed the money.

Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz do their own stunts and that is what makes it even better.  I love the dialog between the characters.  It's quick, fun and flirty.  They really mesh well on screen together.  What I didn't like about the film is that some parts of some scenes must have been edited out.  Sometimes it is really confusing to watch because it is like doing a double take...you say to yourself ""what just happened there""  probably 5 more minutes of dialog and scenes would have made it better.  Also, there is a scene where it is night and CD is following TC .  Then she goes with some agents and it is daytime.  They say ""she's been gone 8 minutes"" then it returns back to night time.  There are a few times things like that happen and it is just disappointing that the script supervisor didn't do a better job, or maybe the editing was strange.  I like the movie True Lies a lot and was hoping this was going to be another one of those action romantic comedies and this one could have been, in fact it could have been better than True Lies, but it just needed a little more.

Tom Cruise, in his later years has really developed into a good actor.  Far from his early films that depended more on his good looks and charm (Born On The 4th of July being the only departure for him when he actually ACTED in a film - if you haven't seen it, give it a try), his later stuff shows real talent.

4033112,4,B002ZG986E,"This movie got seriously panned by movie critics and didn't do all that well at the box office; so much so, that Tom almost lost his Mission Impossible gig and was forced to take a pay cut.  Truthfully, he seems to have done some real damage to his image, what between jumping on Oprah''s couch and then saying silly  things to Matt Lauer about depression.  Somewhere within all that, Tom crossed over to being 'that weirdo scientologist' and he's been turned into little more than a punchline.  Most of his movies have suffered ever since, including this one.  Knight and Day is an excellent movie in my opinion -- it's fun, irreverent, action packed, and best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Tom plays an agent on the run, and when he bumps into Cameron Diaz, she unwittingly gets swooped up into his world and ends up being forced into being on the run with him.  I can't stress enough how FUN and FUNNY this film is.  It really is a good one and deserves to be seen. I've certainly seen worse movies that have done better critically and financially.  Knight and Day takes you on a global adventure to exotic locales and has fun taking you on the ride.  This is better than Mission Impossible, because it's just plain ol' good fun, is easy to follow and is very well acted.  Tom and Cameron have real chemistry.  Definitely one of my fave movies of 2010 and we've watched it several times on Blu-Ray and have been entertained each and every time; we can't say as much for some recent flicks we've seen.

I give the original 4, so I'm giving this 4 just not to be misleading it's really 3.5.  Watch the original with a big bowl of popcorn... and have fun.

Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par.

I am not a Cruz fan in the least.  As a matter of fact, I typically find him to be extremely irritating--over acting for the camera.  However, I actually liked this film. Cameron plays a smart, stylish, tom-boy who is the witty but clueless girl nextdoor type.

She is very convincing in this role.  Cruz stepped out of his I'm the only irrisistable hero/hunk in the world type, and gives an exceptional performance.  He even steps up the humor in this film.  He laughs at himself, and you laugh right along with him.

He's a flawed spy who slips up but rebounds nicely.  He actually plays down his character and gives a witty, charming, and capitivating performance.  He shares the screen with Cameron and doesn't over shadow her.

The supporting characters are very believable, and these supporting actors give strong and extremely convincing performances.  You actually don't know whether to believe him or not.  It's a humorous take on a super spy flick that's simply a winner.

I'm not a car chase fan, but I actually liked the car chase seens in this movie.  This is certainly not a T & A film.  It's a great date night stay at home flick that both the guys and gals will enjoy.

4033309,2,B002ZG986E,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in KNIGHT AND DAY, a completely formulaic action-adventure/romantic comedy that premiered in 2010 and has spent its well-deserved oblivion at the bottom of the ""Clearance"" bin at your local video store.

KNIGHT AND DAY isn't terrible. It just isn't very good. It's a movie meant to be relegated to the purgatory reserved for 2.5 star celluloid. If they still had double features, this would be the lead-in film despite the supposed drawing power of Cruise, considered an A+ Lister and Diaz, an A- Lister.

After watching KNIGHT AND DAY I got curious about the film---either a good sign or a very bad sign---and discovered that it was a piece of intended summer fluff that got stuck in Development Hell for a good long time, with a surprising number of changes of cast, script, scriptwriters, directors, producers, and title (alternate titles included ""Wichita"" and ""Trouble Man""). Somebody owed somebody a favor on this one; otherwise, it would still be locked in the ""script ideas"" file.

The tormented history of KNIGHT AND DAY is subtly reflected in the film which has some serious discontinuities of tone and pace and plot, leading to storyline chaos, and a fallback on multiple-use contrivances. There's just far too much use of knock-out drops, for one thing. For another thing, the ""romance"" in this ""romantic comedy"" is strictly pro forma. Cruise and Diaz have little chemistry between them and they never really click.

KNIGHT AND DAY bombed at the box office. It's very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Killers/dp/B002ZG984Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Killers</a>, another action-adventure-romantic comedy released a few months earlier in 2010 starring the lovely Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher (the very poor man's Tom Cruise), which also tanked.

Cruise plays Roy Miller, nee Matthew Knight, a deep-cover CIA agent who specializes in wet work. He's the ""Knight"" of the title. Miller's either the agent who hasn't been turned, or, he's crazy. We can't tell.

Diaz plays June Havens, a woman trying to make it home for her sister's wedding day (the ""Day"" of the title---I think---it's never clear).

As for Diaz, she's cute rather than sexy onscreen, though there are moments where the camera tells us she's aging, and even a shot or two where she looks downright haggard. Cameron wasn't sleeping well on location. She does turn in a far better performance than Cruise, though, having sincere fun with the role of June, the proverbial babe-lost-in-the-woods-turned-supercompetent-accomplice.

KNIGHT AND DAY's saving grace is its action sequences, which are well done, essentially continuous (they make up 6/8ths of the film) including a gunfire-punctuated car chase in the midst of the San Fermin Running of the Bulls in Seville, Spain (and no, the Running of the Bulls is NOT limited to Pamplona).

The action jumps around in order to keep things moving and doesn't concern itself too much about plausibility and such tiresome details; the whole idea is to keep things happening quickly and keep the plot rushing on to its' inevitable conclusion; it just so happens that part is funny too.

So if you're in the mood to have some lighthearted fun with an action movie which is not intended to be taken too seriously this is a good choice. On top of that some really great scenery is tossed in as a bonus ranging from the Alps to a tropical island.

----------------------------------------

***Brief Review***

I know there are overall positive reviews for this movie.  This however is one of those times where I just don't see it.  (I can already feel a disturbance in the force, and the negative votes and comments coming).

Why did I not like this film?  For one, it's a strait out comedy.  Tom Cruise is killing people, shoting guns, and driving cars incredibly fast, all the while cracking jokes to Cameron Diaz.  He's hanging upside down once, getting ready to get tortured and all the while he keeps smiling and saying ""Don't Worry June"" we're almost home free.  The next minute they are in a plane, the next minute bailing out of said plane, and finally on a remote tropical island.  Frankly I just found the whole experience quite unwatchable.

Tom in this film is like every spy/action character he's ever played rolled into one, with a huge dash of bad comedy thrown in.  Diaz just screams the whole movie and is dragged from one place to the other by Cruise.

What's the story/premise?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Something about a cold fusion battery or something... Who knows.

Let me reiterate, this is my opinion of this film.  If you watched this and thought this was the best movie ever, that's your opinion.  I personally found it a chore to finish, and it took a while for me to finally to complete the whole thing.

Also it rented TERRIBLE.  Nobody wanted to watch it, we had like 40 copies of this thing and they just sat on the shelf.  I had to lie and tell people that Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were naked in it for it to rent at all, nah I didn't really, but I probably should have.

---In Conclusion---

A solid pass in my humble opinion.  Nothing memorable at all.  Still interested?  All I can say then is it's probably in the bargin bin at Wal-Mart or FYE, check there and PLEASE don't pay more than 5 bucks for it.  Back when I was at the video store, we had to sell it for 2.99 and they still were hard to get rid of.

Well, that's my opinion of this film.  If your a die hard Tom fan and I offended you, all I can say is ask youself WWTCD?  He would probably say he didn't like 'Knight & Day' much either and to go watch his new rock & roll movie...",1338508800,,2532,4.468271334792123

Cruise plays his part so well in this tongue-in-cheek adventure that I could not help laughing. Diaz does a nice job as the naive leading lady in film and the action keeps the adventure rolling. This is the kind of film I could watch over and over for a good chuckle.

Instead they are Miller and Havens and we spend too much time trying to figure out how the title came about.  Yes, I get the Knight part.  Now this isn't Oscar worthy stuff and it's unlikely to make a Top 10 or even Top 25 list, but I will admit to having a good time.  The film is filled with all the car chases, stunts and action you could want but it's all pretty predictable and repeatable.  And there's no sex, although seeing Cameron Diaz stuffed into a red bikini has its draw.  Still, Tom Cruise shows his funny, cool charm and Cameron Diaz is a real hoot.  I liked it.",1332720000,2,661,4.15748031496063
4033370,3,B002ZG986E,"Knight and Day was cursed with a zillion rewrites and many years in development hell before it came to the big screen. It shows. Boy, does it show. Everything in the film is so half-assed, superficial, and disposable that's it barely able to stand on its own two feet. Thankfully, the 'star power' of Cruise and Diaz, now pushing the end of their prime and peak, keep it interesting enough.

June is a ditzy blonde (a dangerous new role for Diaz!) who meets Ryan (why does Tom cruise?) at the airport. She is immediately smitten by him and is caught up in a whirlwind of adventure, leading from one ludicrous set-piece to the next, chasing a token MacGuffin, and avoiding a lame CIA bad guy (a quickly-aging Peter Sarsgaard). It's never boring, but the action is the usual post-modern trash with stutter cuts and impossible physics that do not once excite or take your breath away.

The 'CIA Bad Guy' plot is so old it knew the dinosaurs. The Agent-gone-rogue crap was the story behind Mission: Impossibles 1-3 (and in an inverse sense M:I 4 also), as well as 5 Bond movies and all of the Jason Bournes. Puh-lease give us something new. Knight and Day (a stupid, virtually meaningless title) had about 50 people draft the script. I do realize it's hard to conjure up genuine intrigue and plot twists but if you can't do it then you're not much of a writer. Probably why Hollywood loves you then.

An inoffensive timewaster. Do not go out of your way to see it.

The Blu Ray looks nice in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby DTS-HD sound and a bunch of extras I honestly could not care less about.",1331510400,3,1584,4.508710801393728

As a movie buff, I will buy again.",1329782400,,342,4.276923076923077
4033372,4,B002ZG986E,"If you enjoy watching Tom Cruise the person playing a character like Tom Cruise the actor would play when he plays a super-spy in the way that Tom Cruise would be a super-spy if he could be ""Tom Cruise, super-spy"" then you'll enjoy this movie.  This movie has a lot of Tom Cruise going for it.  I can't wait until he plays a super-spy with the nickname ""The Cruiser"".  Alas, not in this movie.

This movie is a lite actioner with some lite humor that works.  Cameron Diaz (IMO) has seen better days; she's looking a little worn down here honestly (my wife even thought so) but she's still fun as the romantic interest and helpless lass.  With decent comedy chops of her own she actually gets to play it a little more straight than Cruise whose super-spy character is not just super-talented he's also super-caring with a twist of quirky and a dash of zany thrown in for good measure.  This movie never tries to be anything other than fun and it succeeds.  If you're looking for a ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Minority Report"" or ""Collateral"" type of intense Cruise look, well, at one of those I just mentioned because you won't find him here.  If you've seen a lot of action movies then you've seen these stunts before.  The movie isn't going to make you scratch your head and wonder what just happened.  If anything it's actually like a 1930s action romance comedy but with an actual budget.  Enjoy it for what it is.

4033375,3,B002ZG986E,"As a comedy this movie does pretty well; as an action flick, this movie is just plain ridiculous.
Knight and Day is a film about an innocent woman who becomes tangled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse because of a chance encounter with a spy.
The performances of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz carry the movie through its rough and silly moments; although the chemistry between them is quite lacking. These two are very good in their team comedic roles and do a lot to make this movie enjoyable to watch. Some of the jokes were too forced and some of the comedy was predictable, but it wasn't enough to dampen the film.
On the other hand, the action and stunts in this movie are so over-the-top and unrealistic that you end up laughing your way through the action scenes. Does no one understand the law of physics these days? And the whole invincibility of the main characters thing is taken a bit far in this film.

**Spoiler Alert**
Diaz's transformation from innocent sweetheart into skilled spy in the end was very predictable and silly. It almost ruined the film. Yes, it brings things back full circle and creates a comic irony, but it doesn't add to the film.
**End Spoiler Alert**

So, yes, see it if you are in the mood for a fun comedy that mocks the action film genre.

As far as questionable content:
As expected, there is some violence and profanity throughout, including a use the f- word.

4033376,3,B002ZG986E,"Knight and Day, beyond its quirky and plot-wise completely meaningless title, is a by the numbers action comedy romp starring a pair of Hollywood A-listers who seem to have just been bored one Saturday afternoon, therefore decided to both go out and shoot a formulaic action flick. This feeling is exactly what carries on through Knight and Day, starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. The film has a plot we've seen countless times before on various 80s and 90's action movies: Rebel Protagonist has rare or valuable object, bad guys from all various areas are after said object, protagonist meets up with a pretty and clueless gal, protagonist protects pretty gal who is discovering more meaning along the way, clueless gal is seduced and charmed by protagonist therefore takes his side in the end, one predictable plot twist has one of the ""good guys"" turn out to be bad, the truth eventually reveals itself, predicted romance ensues by the end, the end.
That being said, the movie is not all that bad. What makes this film work is the quirkiness of Cameron Diaz and charm of Tom Cruise. Now, while the chemistry between them is not very good, it's not bad either; they are handed a script which unfortunately simply contains basic comedic dialogue and work best with what they have. Any other on-screen duo and this would have failed miserably. Cruise and Diaz keep this at tolerable and never go into terrible. In the end though, neither character is ultimately very charming, and we end up disappointed that neither of them did more, or were written better, to at the very least enhance two characters working with an otherwise formulaic plot. I can't really even say there was any real potential or filmmaking ambition here. The plot itself is WAY TOO action/comedy textbook for this to have been anything further than 2 hours of mindless action starring two pretty people. That feeling you get when you watch the trailer, telling yourself, ""um, it looks ok, but not really dying to go see it, looks just kinda typical,"" is true. As this film is very typical. Like I said before, this really does feel like a quick paycheck for both actors, seemingly bored and in between filming better films.

Plot and characters aside, technically speaking, the editing is not anyting new, the sound effects, special effects and stunts we have all seen too many times already. The film even lazily brings us to new scenarios at some points while Cameron Diaz is drugged and alseep in order to get us to the next point without having to actually SHOW us how the two protagonists get out of certain hairing situations. Tom Cruise's secret agent character is too perfect in getting them out of situations that would otherwise be near impossible for any human to escape, and this is done in order to tell the audience how ""good"" of a secret agent he is. It's just way too far-fetched, many times just playing off as a live-action cartoon. Yet even with these fast scene changes, the movie is still about 20 minutes too long, because after an hour, the film will already have shown everything it is going to offer, and by that point you just aren't very interested anymore.

Still, Knight and Day, being as typical and formulaic as it is, does offer a few laughs, and if you find yourself bored with your girlfriend or boyfriend on a weekday evening, pop this one in order to pass the time, because at the very least it makes for brief critical analysis later.

I enjoyed it for what it was, and thought it was quite entertaining and amusing, but far from the intelligence that some of Cruise's older movies held (Minority Report, Mission Impossible). The plot seemed very mechanic, by the numbers formula. When Cruise's character finally reveals the details, there was no ""wow"" moment. In fact, I was disappointed, since I had come to expect something a bit more political and intriguing.

I enjoyed seeing Tom Cruise in a role that kind of made fun of his M:I roles. This was very much a comedy, but there was still a lot of action. It also had a bit of the feel of ""True Lies"" in that Cameron Diaz' character, like Jamie Lee Curtis', is drawn into the spy world with little to no preparation. (There's even a shoot-out in a warehouse like ""True Lies."") Anyway, it's fun, it's funny, and it's entertaining.

4033789,2,B002ZG986E,"Beauty needs imperfection to truly be perfected. Cindy Crawford needs her mole to truly be beautiful.  Harrison Ford needs that little scar to make that face truly unique.  And movies need their imperfections too.. it's the accidents that happen that create those perfect moments of cinema, the magical moments that you remember.  And yes, that is exactly what is missing here...  we have the perfect star pedigree of Cruise and Diaz, the exotic locations with perfect weather, the polished concept of a caper movie combining action and romance with comedy, the likes of which Cary Grant and Hitchcock excelled.  So what's the problem?  It's well enough executed, the action scenes are well choreographed and storyboarded... but it has no magical moments.  It's an airbrushed movie, with the car chases not quite getting the pulse racing, because as excellent as the cgi is, and as innovative as some of the ideas are, you never quite believe it when it's too polished.  As well rehearsed as the smiles and faces full of perfect teeth are, you never quite feel the chemistry is real, just well rehearsed.
For the record, Diaz is an everyday woman not quite satisfied with her place in the world but not knowing anything more... until she meets Cruise apparently accidentally, who draws her into a world of espionage, plane crashes, shootouts, car chases and general melee, interspersed with toothy grins and cocktail making skills in exotic and romantic locations around the world.  Is he a rogue spy, is he using her, or is he a framed man, the only honest one she should really trust?
That's the idea - recreate a caper movie, for a new generation, with a woman as the `everyman'.  The balance between humour and action never quite sticks though.. the tone never finds its way as the punch of action scenes is lost with the addition of hokey attempts at comedy and romance, and the romance lost due to.. well, just a lack of chemistry frankly.  If the film deserves credit, it's for the admirable use of some terrific and varied locations.
In the end though, what is Cindy Crawford without her mole?  What do perfect features become without that imperfection to draw attention to the beauty?  What happens when the scars and blemishes, the wrinkles are magicked away..?  You're left with just a Barbie doll, a plastic version of the real thing... and what we have here is a Barbie doll of a movie, lacking character or moments to remember.  Polish has turned to airbrush, and while you might survive the movie without being too bored, it will fade from your memory faster than it took to watch it.
Sorry, as pleasant as all the ingredients were, this just didn't work for me. Switch off the brain and relish the locations and undeniable charm of the stars, you'll do ok - but beware, don't let any analytical thought start to furrow your brow.",1303776000,3,2845,4.777551020408163

This movie fell flat because I felt the extensive advertising for this movie (trailers/previews, TV commercials) had already shown me all the interesting parts (I didn't seek them out).  The feeling that I had already seen the core of all the significant action pieces ""a hundred times"" drained all the possibility for excitement out of them. Even the seven-month gap between the marketing campaign and my seeing the movie didn't seem to help. The cumulative effect was I was really struck by the feeling of having already seen (most of) the movie. Whereas some movies have only a few good scenes and use them relentlessly in their promos, this movie had many good scenes but didn't seem to hold much back from the promos. Aside: For comparison,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Salt/dp/B0045ODPKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Salt</a>, which was released a month later, managed to effectively promote itself without this problem (Salt was reportedly originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle).

The cinematography was also strange--it often had a very shallow depth of field (think near-sightedness: foreground in sharp focus, background fuzzy) and actors that were _noticeably_ more brightly lit than the scene. In some scenes, the foreground (typically Cruise and Diaz) was so unnaturally ""popped"" forward that it was jarring for me. My initial reaction was that this was some artifact of reducing a 3-D movie to 2-D, but IMDB's spec says that this was not a 3-D movie.  These problems with the cinematography _inescapably_ signaled that they were working on a set (blue screen) which took me out of the moment.

If it weren't for these two aspects, it probably would have been a strong 4-star movie.

The Cameron Diaz role seemed like it was written so that it could be played by most female stars. Diaz is predominantly a RomCom actress and she doesn't project the athleticism and intensity/grit that facilitates taking action sequences up a level, but the script and stunts weren't customized for her strengths and limitations.  Rather than her sharing in the comedic elements in the stunts, they were Cruise's province (and he pulls them off nicely).

Note: Because the motorcycle chase is so heavily featured in the promos, including the cover art for this DVD, I was expecting far far more than was here. The Bond film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tomorrow-Never-Dies/dp/B00000K0EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tomorrow Never Dies</a>&nbsp;(1997) raised the bar for such chases and this one comes across as prosaic.",1297900800,3,2681,5.537897310513447

A secret agent discovers that one of his fellow agents is about to betray the inventor/genius they're supposed to be protecting; so, to save the inventor, he removes him [and his invention, a revolutionary power generating device] from the secret facility where they were being ""protected"", to a safe area of his own. He is then branded a rogue by the government (who believes the real traitor), and must run -- from them and various criminals who want the invention too. Along the way, he meets the pretty girl; fate intervenes, and he and the pretty girl find themselves thrown together; chaos ensues...and, of course, love. Cue in lots more bad guys, bad situations, and, finally, happily ever after.

As I say, this sort of plot is the silly stuff of spy novels; what makes Knight and Day worth watching, though, is that it's not really a serious film. It's more romantic/adventure comedy than anything else. The situations are outrageous, the solutions impossible, but it's all in good fun.

In this outing Cruise plays a spy who is on the run from the CIA who meets a funny and beautiful car restorer, played to perfection by Cameron Diaz (Tom's co-star in 2001's ""Vanilla Sky""). The two join forces as they fight off evil forces, travel the world to exciting and exotic locales, and ultimately fall in love. As great as Cruise is in this movie it's Diaz's portrayal that steels the picture. She plays her part with convincing comedy and her chemistry with Cruise is the right fix for the picture.

 ""Knight and Day"" became a box office hit grossing over $260,000,000 on a huge budget of $117,000,000, one of the biggest budgets for a Tom Cruise film.

4034067,2,B002ZG986E,"Not terrible.  Not very good.  Just kind of bland and forgettable.  KNIGHT AND DAY is a romance/action/comedy movie starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, in which the chemistry between the stars is about a 3, and too much of the action is unbelievable and uninvolving.

Diaz plays June Havens, who cutely meets Cruise's CIA assassin, Roy Miller, at the Wichita airport as she's heading to Boston for a wedding.  But Cruise is really a secret agent, and when they find themselves on a nearly empty airliner together (the crew is there to kill Cruise), he takes them all out while June is in the bathroom.  Then he has to land the jetliner in a cornfield.

Thus begins the globe-trotting contrivances of Patrick O'Neill's sub-Bondian screenplay that finds our hero and tag-along heroine zooming from Boston to Brooklyn to a tropical island to the Alps to the running of the bulls in Spain with bad guys in persistent pursuit.  One of the gags of the movie is that Cruise drugs Diaz before moving to a new location, so she's always waking up confused and angry in a strange place.

The pursuers, including Cruise's CIA rival (Pater Sarsgaard), their mutual boss (Viola Davis), and an evil Spanish arms dealer (Jordi Molla), are after the Zephyr, a preposterous MacGuffin that is supposed to be a source of endless clean energy... or something.  Paul Dano, playing the Zephyr's inventor, becomes Cruise and Diaz's nerdy sidekick for awhile and brings a glimmer of life to the film.

James Mangold (WALK THE LINE, COP LAND, 3:10 TO YUMA) was probably not the ideal choice of a director to infuse this shopworn material with verve and panache.  He sparks little electricity between his two stars, and his CG-heavy action sequences are phony and dull.  Trying to update the style of movie Alfred Hitchcock excelled at requires the master's ability to emotionally engage the audience in the characters' situation.  Not all of Hitchcock's movies completely succeeded, but in the ones of this genre that did (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, TO CATCH A THIEF), you cared about the people even when some of the filmmaking seams might be obviously showing.

KNIGHT AND DAY is also a clear illustration of the continuing downward spiral of the ""star system"" in Hollywood.  Once counted on to ""open"" movies - bring in boffo returns on opening weekends - Tom Cruise's feet of box office clay have become more and more apparent as one movie after another has financially disappointed.  But he's just one example of the many formerly reliable movie stars audiences have stopped turning out to see just because their names are above the title.  Hopefully, the Hollywood powers that be are realizing that, with the myriad choices available, audiences won't necessarily fall for a piece of dull, tired filmmaking like KNIGHT AND DAY.",1296000000,3,2800,4.908704883227176
4034068,5,B002ZG986E,"""Knight & Day"" is fast action entertaining and comedy movie. You can criticize plot or not but it's entertaining and I'm gonna watch it many times. I'd say Tom Cruise is back with his smile. I like that character: sport type, tough, calm, smart and smile.
Plot of movie is not too trivial, so you keep guessing what's next. I would not tell about it to not spoil your joy of movie. I'd probably compare ""Knight & Day"" with Jason Bourne, but you have a Tom Cruise and elements of comedy which go alone through whole movie what makes you enjoy it and not jump.

The agent kills all of the many people on the plane that try to kill him, including the pilots, and the plane crashes. He leaves the woman, who is arrested by the FBI, who want to find the agent. It turns out that he is carrying a battery that everyone wants to get, the woman repeatedly does flakey things that get her in trouble and he needs to rescue her, and the agent and the woman fall in love.

4034070,4,B002ZG986E,"Impact:

Watching this film is like going on a roller coaster ride across the world! It starts off with June Havens (Cameron Diaz), an average young lady about to make a local flight. After bumping into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the terminal, and then meeting on the flight, they start up a little chat. She goes to the bathroom to freshen up...and then its like whoa! A massive fight scene starts up on the plane, the pilots get involve and get killed as well. However, by the time June comes out of the restroom, all seems quiet again and Roy has drinks waiting. She seems a bit curious as to what is going on, especially when Roy says that he has to land the plane and all the dead bodies start to roll out of their seats.

Victim by Convenience:

June's life then it turned completely upside-down, as all of a sudden she is caught up in the world of espionage and secret agents. She tries to get out of it, but Roy always seems to catch up with her. She is moved from location to location across Europe, as she begins to learn what is at the heart of the matter, which is a very special battery.

High Mix of Action and Comedy:

This is a highly intense action film, and the body count rises by the minute, but because of the 'shock treatment' that June is subjected to, it can seem to be funny at points. There is a lot of stunt work in this film with includes: Car chases (inclusive of car jumping, as made popular in the matrix reloaded), motorcycle stunt work and gun & knife fights. For the climax, you are taken to Spain, where even about a dozen bulls get into the action (you really need to see what happens here).

Conclusion:

This is a very entertaining film, maybe not Oscar material, but very high on the action level. The plot is pretty sound and is not too predictable. Recommended!!!",1295827200,,1804,4.335311572700297

The rest of the cast was good, but my biggest gripe about the movie(without revealing the plot)is that the movie does some fast forward sequences in several parts, and all that did was make me angry, because it seemed that those would have been the best parts to watch.

They were engaging and likeable, and you just had to laugh at the over-the-top ways they could escape bullets and kidnapping attempts and other attacks on their lives.

Whatever boneheads (at serious movie review media places) gave this movie poor reviews is to MISS THE POINT totally about this movie.  This movie does not, at any time, endeavor to depict a ""serious"" action story.  It's a comedy, a parody, a time to romp and play and have fun with two awesome actors whose characters have tender moments, delightfully funny moments and dang fine acting in the midst of their characters' ridiculous situations.  It's a tongue-in-cheek style which is thoroughly entertaining and watchable.

Yes, so there are parts where the plot falls apart a little bit, or where the scenes don't show how they escape from what-ever tense and torturous hostage situation.  It doesn't matter.

Tom still has a great smile that materializes during the moments of peril. (For example, when he has to tell Cameron that there is no pilot in the cockpit of the jet.) Cameron is easy to like.

I only saw the first Blu-ray DVD as it was rented. However I had a great time and was on the edge of the seat from start to finish. I really liked June Havens's (Cameron Diaz) attitude towards the end of the movie. This was just the right mix of absurd action and attitudes. Many movies have a similar mix of characters and plot but I cannot think of one that executed it better.

The basic story is that a battery of great power was built and someone is out to pilfer it from the government agency in charge of keeping it safe. Now just who can that be. June must find out before it is too late. In the process June may just learn a little bit about herself and what she really wants in life. The catalyst is a wild man with a broad set of skills and knowledge, Roy Miller (Tom Cruise).

But things improved quite a bit after that and her character really comes through. I've watched a lot of violent/action movies because there are three males in my family, and I'm often stressed by the violence.

Tom Cruise may be one of the most obnoxious celebrities around, but he's a fun actor and he works that suspicious charm all over this film.  I am smitten with Cameron Diaz (who I feel is highly underrated as on of her generations greatest working actresses) and she is all sorts of charismatically alluring in this film.  The action sequences are non-stop and totally engrossing and the basic plot (a predictable twist off the expected espionage thriller) is interesting enough to hold it's own in the film.  The supporting cast is a whose-who of respectable faces doing underwhelming things (Sarsgaard is demoted to predictably sleazy, Viola Davis is stuck in `Law and Order' mode and Paul Dano is laughably out of his element) yet they are forgiven thanks to the quick-fire pace of the film itself.

This movie went through a long development hell before being released. It didn't do too well in the North American box office but it did respectably to good overseas. The problem was that they sold it as a romantic action picture when it's really more of an off the top comedy with romance and action elements. People going in expecting a high octane powered action piece will surely be disappointed.

In fact, it breaks a lot of the action rules common to the action genre, like people small talking in the middle of a gun fight and breaking action flow. That said, if you go in knowing what they're trying to do you might appreciate it. This picture is reminiscent of some of the old films from the 70s like FUN WITH DICK AND JANE. It borders on screwball comedy at times but then dives back down into over the top action but it really feels like the action is in the background story wise as we learn more about the characters.

White dude high-fives to both Cruz and Diaz for doing more of their own stunts -- including some of the most dangerous ones -- than I've ever seen major stars do in an action flick (and Knight and Day definitely works as an action flick too).

I remember the ""major"" critics being pretty tough on this film when it came out.  Had to remind myself that the pros watch studio previews with other pros, and then they compete with one another to see who can drip the most vitriol on fun movies like this that most audiences will love.

It doesn't answer the grand mysteries of life and it'll never be confused with Dostoevsky, it's just 90 minutes of a really great time watching an entertaining film with enough surprises to keep you interested, laughs galore and a great chemistry between its stars.

The extras on the disk fill in the blanks, but you can tell watching the movie that everybody involved had a blast making it.

Loved it start to finish, and it grows on me even more every time I watch it.

For bluray'ers, GREAT dub, amazing picture and the soundtrack is every bit the equal of the best releases.

Just like in an older action comedy film you know the characters won't die and that it will be a happy ending. The movie is totally unbelievable. Personally I would compare it to fun movies like the Princess Bride and the original Indiana Jones films. It's not quite as good as those films but it's much better than a lot of action comedies these days.
If you are looking for a cerebral movie with brooding overly developed characters you will have a hard time with this one. However, if you just want to relax and watch what I would consider to be an action movie spoof, this is your flick.

KNIGHT AND DAY is pure fun. It is an action comedy that doesn't try too hard, has a lot of intimate moments at offbeat times, and is completely endearing from start to finish. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz click with lots of action, witty dialog, and great chemistry. Think of it as a much better take on the Scarecrow and Mrs. King. Cruise is a secret agent that seems to have lost a marble or two. Diaz is just a normal girl who rebuilds old muscle cars. And while it's easy to think of the movie as a parody or a sendup of all spy movies or even just Cruise's own Mission Impossible series, it isn't. It's not a farce or a spoof. It's just a tight, kooky, engaging flick that stands on its own. And KNIGHT AND DAY is rated PG-13 which makes it great to watch with the entire family.  We watched this with 3 generations (from 5 to 75), and everyone enjoyed themselves.

The Blu-Ray version of KNIGHT AND DAY is especially nice, with fantastic DTS sound and amazing color and clarity. Honestly, I've seen it twice and could watch it a few more times. The last movie I felt that way about was the 2009 Star Trek movie. For a light, cozy, entertaining evening at home, KNIGHT AND DAY is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

4034447,4,B002ZG986E,"KNIGHT AND DAY, I expected to be terrible, but Tom Cruise is always reliable enough to give you something worth watching and I was pleasantly surprised by everything involved here. You just have to know what you're watching before you go in.

It is OVER THE TOP, and I hate OVER THE TOP in most movies. I hated the assassins trying to kill Six Echo and Two Delta in the movie THE ISLAND, flying a helicopter and trying to shoot two unarmed and clueless social retards as they climb behind a hotel sign, or the F-18 scene in Die Hard 4 that destroyed an overpass in order to shoot a semi-truck, and failed only to have John McClain crouching on the wing as it circled as if he were Spiderman, or the entire ridiculous foolishness that was the movie 2012 with crevace jumping winnebagos and planes flying beneath subway cars and limos that maneuver like indy cars.

KNIGHT AND DAY, has its own ridiculous moments, but in the grand scheme of things, the whole thing is over the top. That is who Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is. He's an enigma. He's James Bond meets Inspector Gadget meets Derek Flint meets Jackie Chan.

The movie is a comedy and part of the comedy is the insanity that is Roy Miller's life. The changes in the story are creative and the twists are done with tact and creativity and impressive writing. KNIGHT AND DAY is one of the funnests most worthwhile times watching a movie I've had in years. It is always interesting. As crazy as it was to watch Roy Miller (Cruise) riding on the windshield of a dodging and racing through traffic, while being fired at car, all the while having a calm and collected conversation with a screaming panicing June Havens (Cameron Diaz), it was all workable in a movie that was OVER THE TOP in its entirety.

The makers of KNIGHT AND DAY didn't try to pass off OVER THE TOP action scenes in order to please the OVER THE TOP loving crowd, the whole movie is OVER THE TOP and it makes KNIGHT and DAY a rare exception in my OVER THE TOP hating vendetta.

It's fun. Suspend belief, have fun, play along and watch Tom Cruise, as weird as he is in real life, do what he does best.... entertain.",1294012800,,2133,4.403553299492386

The action is over the top, of course, and there is no doubt that Tom and Cameron will get together in the end. As for the plot, it has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting.

This movie was never intended to be anything more than an entertaining thrill ride, and I think it succeeded. There were just a few times when things just didn't seem right, mostly with some of Tom's actions (I won't go into details here). Still, those were minor quibbles.

As for plot holes and logic? I don't watch these type movies to go that deep into analysis and motive, so I'll leave that to the more analytical crowd.

It did not do well at the box office domestically because U.S film critics were harsh, but it performed superbly in the international market.  International films fans understood to not take it too seriously.  Both Tom and Cameron performed well in their roles. They had some adorably funny lines to deliver. Regardless of what is in the gossip columns on these actors, they are good/great actors depending on the roles and scripts they are given.  If you want to see a nice escape from reality type movie, watch this one.

About 2 weeks after I purchased the three disc combo, I watched the Video On Demand extended version that was provided free with the purchase.  I enjoyed the extended version as well.

We then spent the entire movie laughing and felt it was worth every penny.  There are times when you don't want to be mentally challenged and just want to be entertained in an adult manner.  This is exactly what this movie does.  I have gotten to the point that I don't read critic's reviews.  Instead I look at the ratings that the public gives a movie and comparing it with the critic's ratings.  If they are about the same you can be sure it is either good or bad depending on the ratings.  If however the critics rating is lousy and the public's is good, you can pretty much assume that the critics are panning the movie because they are afraid to admit that sometimes entertainment can be good without being high art.

Knight and Day stared the fading superstar Tom Cruise and a tired looking Cameron Diaz. The film had a good pace, nice scenery, plenty of action, Cruise was fun to watch, and the story did have a few twists. Not nearly as bad as critics make it out to be.

Well, I am sorry to have missed it on the big screen as I truly enjoyed it on the small screen when we rented the DVD last night. This is pure, unadulterated fun! Cameron Diaz, in a role that is almost tailor-made for her, plays June Havens, who works on restoring classic cars. Her normal life takes a turn for the bizarre when she meets a mysterious man named Roy (Tom Cruise). Soon, June finds herself getting caught up in some serious action, being pursued by strange men who seem bent on harming her, and of course, gets taken along for the ride of her life (albeit reluctantly) by Roy.

There are many holes in the plot and if you question each and every implausibility, you'll never be able to enjoy the movie for what it is - mindless, fun entertainment. I laughed out loud at many points in this movie, especially at the comic interactions between Roy and June. Each time Roy feels he needs to 'exit' with June, he puts June 'under', so that she is unconscious. Miraculously, every time, June finds herself outfitted in new clothes, and even a bikini at one point. Now, I initially questioned this bit - how the heck did Roy find the time to shop for a suitable, right-sized outfit for June? After a while, I gave up and just enjoyed the movie with all of its implausibilities.

The action is almost non-stop, and takes viewers to some exotic locales. Part of what makes this movie fun to watch is not so much the action sequences which frankly are not all that impressive, certainly not in the league of movies like Mission Impossible, but the credible chemistry between Cruise and Diaz. The couple sizzle on-screen with their sexual chemistry and good looks, but it is the banter between the two that had me in stitches.

It was a top-drawer, cliche-ridden exercise in fun.

*Undeniable Humor- I was surprised to find that Cruise wasn't the stereotypical smoldering James Bond type of spy. He had some great comedic lines and the rest of the humor seemed natural.

Things you might hate:
*Unrealistic Action- CGI is used quite a bit to perform stunts that clearly no human can do. The characters seem to have force fields because the amount of bullets that miss them is astounding.

It's a Romantic Action film. Half ""chick flick"" and half ""shoot-up everyone in sight"". It sounds like that would be impossible to put together, and in real life it would, but this is pure entertainment.

Some of the criticism I read about is a lack of chemistry between Cruz and Diaz. I didn't see it. I found that I liked both characters and believed the storyline on an emotional level. Nothing is deep here, but it may be a bit to intense for the single digit elementary school crowd.

I would have posted the review with three stars but we gave it an upgrade thanks to our Amazon VOD experience.  This was our first time to watch an HD video via Amazon On Demand. Gotta say that we were very satisfied, having recently purchased the Roku XD/S Player. We did so, specifically because it offered Amazon VOD, as well as Netflix. Value-wise, it's hard to beat Netflix streaming but at this point, their HD streaming suffers when compared to Amazon's HD video. For what it's worth, we have a 47"" Phillips HD monitor and, as I said, very pleased with the Amazon VOD image.

This movie isn't terrible; it just doesn't bring anything to the table that justifies buying it over almost any other movie in the action genre. The story is vague, and unintersting. I still don't fully understand why June and Roy were together, or why the plane was necessary. The basic premise is Roy ( Tom Cruise ) is trying to stop a rogue agent, who has framed him as a rogue agent, from stealing a battery. I still don't know why June ( Cameron Diaz ) was involved in the story, but her character brings nothing to the already flimsy story.

Half way through the film, something strange happens. Roy puts June to sleep, becasue she wasn't coping well, and it starts a sequence that shows june half waking up to see Roy, and herself in increasingly dangerous situations, that Roy obviously gets them out of. In another movie this may have been an interesting scene, but in a movie where very little interesting happens, to skip over potentially entertaining sequences is a diservice to the viewer. The worst part is that they do this twice. Unacceptable.

The action is the movies only redeeming quality. Unfortunately Roy is such a badass, none of the fights have any weight; you always know who is going to win. It is never even a contest. All in all, this is a movie that should have been great, but as it is only manages to be disappointing. Look elsewhere for entertainment.",1292457600,5,1659,4.560402684563758

Knight and Day is a Mission Impossible clone minus the plotline plus the annoying Cameron Diaz. What is it about? Well, its filled with explosions and stupid dialog where nothing really makes too much sense. Cruise bounces around in the movie like he is back on Oprah's couch while Diaz squeeks and squawks as the female lead who starts off as a Brain-in-dish-somewhere kidnapping victim, turning into super-spy sidekick.

If there was a decent screenplay to go with all the explosions, then this film would have worked. It relies too much on the non-existant chemistry between Diaz and Cruise.

Great action sequences, Great plot and script, and wonderful sexual tension that is entertaining and believeable.  I love this movie!!!

The movie is a little manic and fast paced, but there is a lot of fun action, quite a few laughs/chuckles, and Tom and Cameron have great chemistry together. The plot is pretty nonsensical to be honest but still very entertaining. The basic plot revolves around Cameron Diaz's character who is trying to get to her sister's wedding, until she bumps into Tom Cruise's character, who turns out to be a rogue secret agent under FBI surveillance, the majority of the film consists of them trying to stay alive and learning they can trust each other. Tom Cruise really surprised me throughout the movie, he gives a really fun, entertaining, eccentric performance, you can tell he's not taking himself or the movie too seriously, he is just trying to put on a good show. Cameron is really great as well, her smile really brightened the screen and she has good comedic timing. I'd say the movie is worth the purchase if you enjoy your action with some comedy on the side or if you are a fan of either Tom or Cameron. If you want to compare this movie to others, I would say it was like the recent film ""Killers"" or even Brad/Angie's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", however I enjoyed this movie much more than those two!

The name Knight comes from the real name of Tom Cruise aka Rob Miller aka Matthew Knight. Plus he uses a toy knight to conceal an experimental battery that can power a whole city. I am sure there may be some other knight symbols, such as knight in shining armor etc., but the movie isn't designed to be that deep. Cruise bumps into Diaz (June) in an airport as they get on the same flight. After some innocent flirting Diaz goes into the airplane restroom and does some primping, trying to figure out how to hook up with Rob Miller (Cruise). While Diaz is looking in the mirror checking out her T&A, Cruise is being attacked by everyone on the plane. Diaz comes out, has a drink with Cruise who explains that the pilots are dead.

Later in the movie Diaz attempts to have a serious conversation with her former bf. As she explains about the airplane, he ignores her and tries to talk about ""the relationship."" The movie is filled with these numerous turn arounds, most of which come near the end. One chase scene reminded us of that ""Mission Impossible"" criticized impossible train explosion scene, as Cruise jumps to the wind shield of an automobile which Diaz is driving. Crusie jumps around building tops like The Phantom and at one point Diaz models a red bikini for us. Eventually Diaz gets into the whole spy thing and decides to take matters in her own hands. The movie is fun and clever. The action has impossible chase scenes, but what action movie doesn't. It would make a great date movie.

4034951,4,B002ZG986E,"Forget the bonehead professional and wannabe movie critics.  This movie was funny with plenty of action to boot.  I concede that the plot was Standard Hollywood and Tom Cruise's CIA agent outrageously hypercompetent in everything he does (but then so was the Bourne character), so don't expect subtlety or great filmmaking.  But it was a hoot to watch.

See the other reviews for the basic plot.  I thought Cameron Diaz played her character pretty much on the money.  The poor woman has to figure out if Miller (Cruise's character) really is a murderous lunatic or someone being chased by a pack of truly bad men.  She does it humorously well, with Cruise coming up (and showing up) with comically inappropriate statements.  No chemistry between Diaz and Cruise?  I beg to differ.  There's a great scene with her riding on a motorcycle's bars facing backward and shooting around Cruise at the bad guys behind them.  Cruise compliments her skill at shooting, at which she positively glows at him.  It's almost sweet.

The movie drags a little in the middle compared to the first part; it gets a little more serious for a while.  That sort of temporary lag is typical; only the Marx brothers could make a feature-length show that was equally funny from beginning to end.  But ""Knight and Day"" is an action movie as well as comedy, so it works out.

Don't be too logical about this show.  Kick back and watch a couple of pros strut their stuff.  Let the movie critics prattle on about how a real movie would have incestuous homosexuals in self-destructive conflict with themselves and their family and friends to all end in a holocaust of suffering and death.",1291507200,2,1656,4.750877192982456

I'll admit, I kept my distance from the film while it was at the box office due to the horrid reviews I had read/heard from all over, including friends of mine. No, there's nothing ground breaking here plot-wise, and character development was pretty minimal, but the overall package - which I think was meant as a ""little something for everyone"" worked out some of the kinks.

I'm no Tom Cruise fan, by any means, but I thought his performance was better than expected - Not to the extent of his performance in The Last Samurai, but not his worst either. Diaz was charming, funny, and enjoyable as she played up to the level of Cruise. The Cruise/Diaz duo seems to work and I wouldn't mind seeing them head up future films - but not necessarily a sequel to Knight and Day.

There's plenty of action, guns, car chases, some violence, and a choice word or two along the way but nothing over-the-top.

Hindsight dictates that all those who got in Roy Miller's way should've just stayed in their booths. A sexy Cameron Diaz and a slightly creepy Tom Cruise make KNIGHT AND DAY a grand, over-the-top spy adventure, and I sure liked it a hell of a lot better than its close cousin KILLERS. Even at the age of 72, Tom Cruise can still kick it as a master secret agent. And, going by this DVD's Behind-the-Scenes featurette, Cruise did most of his own stunts. And if you factor in all the unbelievable things that his character gets up to in the film, that is an impressive reveal.

The story initially throws out just enough ambiguity concerning Cruise's character that you're not sure whether this guy's to be trusted or what. Roy Miller, cloaked in mystery, first latches onto June Havens (Diaz) in an airport, and there's a spark. June is flying out to her sister's wedding. She restores automobiles, which makes her infinitely sexy. We don't know why Roy is flying. We do know the flight ends in body bags and a plane crash, preceded by a pretty damn nifty fight sequence in the plane. On a side note, if it's bugging anyone, that bit of tango music used to score the fight is Gotan Project's awesome ""Santa Maria (Del Buen Ayre)."" I love that tune, but it's getting so that everyone and his blue-haired granny is putting this song in their movie.

June survives the plane crash. Can she survive Roy Miller, who seems bent on shadowing her everywhere she went? Government agents show up to inform her that Roy a week ago was the most trusted covert agent in the Agency, that is, until Roy's full blown break with reality. Except that Roy, earlier on, had warned June that men would be coming to say exactly this kind of stuff. So who's lying? Who's paranoid? Who's unstable? Can a romance blossom when colored by deception and incoming hails of gunfire? Waves of assassins come out of the woodwork, and they're also targeting June. You'd think this would add to Roy Miller's credibility.

A movie like this requires a McGuffin to send its characters frantically dashing around the globe, and so we learn of the Zephyr, which is this inexhaustible battery prototype that could theoretically power a city in perpetuity. Everyone wants this device. Roy Miller, delusional or not, gone rogue or not, possesses this device. What are Roy's intentions regarding the Zephyr? We're in the dark for some time.

Roy Miller is so impressive as a secret agent that he attains an aura of near comic book invincibility. There's never one moment in which you get the sense that Roy's bit off more than he can chew. KNIGHT AND DAY isn't meant to be gritty nor is it grounded in reality. It's straight-up summer popcorn, and I had a lot of fun watching it. Cruise and Diaz are great together, Cameron Diaz as sweet as ever. But it's Cruise's slightly off-hinged performance that kept me engaged. Fast-paced. Quirkily romantic. Cloak & daggery. Big, explosive stunts. Big special effects. Exotic locations. You can tell where the money went. This movie isn't touchy-feely or socially relevant. It won't challenge your brain. But it achieves what it sets out to do, which is to entertain. The two leads are pros at being appealing. There are sequences in which your jaw may even drop. I think you'll chuckle in spots. I'm still smiling at Cruise's frenzied ""Life expectancy... with me... without me..."" speech. And I did say this was better than KILLERS. The difference between the two is like... KNIGHT AND DAY.

The DVD's bonus material: ""Wilder Knights and Crazier Days"" is the behind-the-scenes featurette focusing on the crazy stunt work done by Cruise and Diaz (00:12:30 minutes); ""Knight & 'Someday'"" is a segment chronicling Tom Cruise's visit with the Black Eyed Peas in London during their 2010 world tour as the Peas debut ""Someday,"" the song the Peas composed for the end credits of KNIGHT AND DAY; it's a cool song, too (00:09:09); two viral videos promoting the movie: ""Soccer"" (Tom and Cameron spectacularly kicking around a soccer ball; 00:01:08) and ""Kick"" (Cameron rehearsing a kick on Tom; 00:01:21); and the theatrical trailer.",1291420800,2,4203,4.7837465564738295
4035054,4,B002ZG986E,"Knight and Day reminded me of the old Avengers television show a bit.  If you've ever watched it, you'll see the two main characters goofing a bit during tense scenes, and that's what you have here.  Mr. Cruise's character attempts to act like nothing is going on while Ms. Diaz's character is away from the action, which just adds a bit of comedy to each scene.  It's hard to worry if the characters are going to make it through because of the comedic effect, but it's fun to watch their antics throughout the movie.

We rented this movie, and suggest you do as well because it's probably not a movie that we'll seek out to watch again.  Maybe if it were to show up on cable somewhere, I would stop and check it out.

Remember when you were a kid and used to fantasize about being the super secret agent man, getting the hot girl, and proceeding to kick all kinds of ass through the backdrop of exotic places and far away lands? Well, I did. But spy movies these days are so much more serious and brooding. Not that I have anything against Jason Bourne, the Craig-era Bond films, or anything Liam Neeson happens to star in, but it kinda' leaves you to wonder ""whatever happened to all the lighthearted stuff?"" Enter Knight and Day; a romantic comedy at the heart of an action/adventure/espionage flick that's not quite True Lies, but possess its own charm in the same vein. Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is running around with an important piece of technology when he drags in June Havens (Cameron Diaz) as an unsuspecting cohort. Comedy, drama, and romance ensue as the duo travel around the world to find the creator of this device and take him into protective custody while also trying to expose the real rogue agent within the ranks of the CIA. No, the story isn't as epic as Bourne or Bond, but I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed the film overall. A lot of it is due in large part to the actor chemistry, followed very closely by Cruise's natural comedic charisma, and even a little bit of Diaz's subtle beauty. To be honest, it's been ages since I've seen her in a movie (I think the last one was Gangs of New York), but I think she looks pretty good here. She doesn't appear to have a whole lot of makeup on, I like her hair, and she looks very fit in that bikini. And I personally have always liked Cruise as an actor despite is off-camera antics. I've always thought of him as being very meticulous in preparation, which really seems to reflect in his performances. But to me, Knight and Day is one of those films where you really have to let yourself be imaginative. It's the kind of movie that draws its entertainment from your own ability to say ""this is ridiculous and cool at the same time, I wish I could do it."" If I were to compare this to a more recent franchise, I'd say it's closer to the TV series Chuck, only reverse the male-female roles, take out the (obvious) character development, and remove all the geekdom/pop culture references.

Video - 4.5

The video transfer is excellent. Colors are especially vibrant through all the various shooting locales whether it be the lush greenery on Miller's hideaway island, the sunny baked oranges of Spain, or even the plain hometown humdrum of Boston. As a result of these changing color palettes skin tones range somewhere between normal and ""deceptively tanned."" It's no distraction by any means, though, thanks to the presence of a very fine layer of film grain, which is most noticeable in outdoor shots. Saturation also tends to be a little on the hot side (most notably when actors are directly exposed to sunlight), but I think it makes the settings feel more realistic. Black levels are deep and provide a good amount of shadow delineation between intricately-lined fabrics, stage props (particularly guns), and body shapes in the dark. Meanwhile, contrast provides just enough brightness to compliment everything else making for a very clear picture. Image detail is sharp and I'm pleased with how much depth there is (again with Diaz wearing that bikini). There's a bit of CG used during the more extreme action sequences (since you obviously can't pull off such over-the-top stunts without it) as well as some inherent noise in the darker shots, but neither of them are ever a big problem. Otherwise, things like Edge Enhancement, Digital Noise Reduction, compression artifacts, and debris are nowhere to be found. My favorite parts of the movie you could probably use as showcase material include the airplane fight at the beginning (good detail considering how closed and tight the space is), the Bull Run sequence at the end (for colors, saturation, and even more detail), the nighttime scene in Austria where June is following Roy (lots of of blacks and shadows, or maybe even the warehouse shootout), and, if you're up for it, the highway chase through Boston (this is where you'll see most of the CG, but it's a pretty cool looking scene anyway). Good job by director of photography Phedon Papamichael and the people at Fox for providing a real eye-pleaser.

Audio - 4.5

We start with the airplane scene where the LFEs make themselves apparent through the occasional bump of air turbulence. Dialogue is clear and discernible from the center channel as Roy and June make for an interesting exchange of chit-chat and stories. After she goes into the lavatory to freshen up we're introduced to a small and quick sampling of the actiony sound design. The score by John Powell (which is ironically reminiscent of his work in the Bourne films) plays and separates itself into the fronts and rears with a just a little bit of bass in the rhythm, while the fisticuffs and weapons give off all kinds of directionality. Martial arts counterattacks, the whiffing of clothes, and connection of hits provide a good, loud smack across from left to right, right to left and seat belts and grazing knives whiz and whip around with tense authority. There's a little bit of gunfire that's doused out by the muffling of suppressors, but they still provide some excellent bass thumps and ricochet from the sides to and around the rears. All of this, by the way, is on top of the fact that you can still hear the light whirring of the plane engines outside the cabin. The next big scene is the highway chase. Vehicle noise and engine revving offer some really good dynamics, at least until Roy shows up. When he does you get to hear lots of bullets going through windows, a few crashes, and even an exploding SUV. After that is a scene in which Roy and June are in a warehouse and they get ambushed by a bunch of guys with automatic weapons. It's actually a pretty short sequence, but provides a little bit more in terms of directionality as the bullets deflect everywhere. Then finally, is the last scene in Spain during the Bull Run. Again, it's a short scene, but it's the climax of the action and we really get hear a little of everything (bulls stampeding, bullets deflecting, cars crashing, a fast motorcycle, and uptempo music). If anything the only downside to this lossless track is the quietness during the non-action scenes, but that's more a result of the narrative, which would obviously be case since it's still a romantic comedy. It's not quite reference, but is still very serviceable.

Extras - 2.0

What a disappointing set of extras. As attention-detailed as director James Mangold is, we don't even get an audio commentary. Instead there's a 12-minute EPK (""Wilder Knights and Crazy Days"") that talks about the production of the movie itself, where we get bits and pieces of info from cast and crew about what they wanted to convey, how it all came about, and the filming process itself. It heavily emphasizes the fact that Cruise likes to do a lot of his own stunts (if not all of them), which is pretty cool in itself and a respectable characteristic to a fine actor. The rest of is basic pat-on-the-back fluff between the director, producers, actors, and your basic run of the mill coverage stuff. Next is another 8-minute feature (""Boston Days and Spanish Knights"") essentially discussing the filming. When a film crew travels around to exotic locations I tend to become very interested in how and where they shoot it. Unfortunately, this one is just as run of the mill, if not more, than the first. Third is a 9-minute feature (""Knight and 'Someday': Featuring the Black Eyed Peas and Tom Cruise"") where we get to see how the film's ending song came together. Here you basically see some behind-the-scenes footage of Cruise visiting BEP on tour in London, talk to will.i.am backstage, and then join them on stage as they debut the song. After that are two 1-minute ""Viral Videos"" of Cruise and Diaz goofing around; one with a CG soccer ball and another with Diaz kicking Cruise through a table. They're kinda' funny, but ultimately pointless. And finally are two truncated versions of the combined EPKs (""Knight and Day: Story"" and ""Knight and Day: Scope""), which just rehash the production and shooting. Overall this a very disappointing and underwhelming package of special features. But considering how poorly the film did in theaters, I'm sad, but not surprised. I think the movie is pretty good regardless of criticism and would've enjoyed at least an audio commentary or two (one with Mangold and the other with Cruise and Diaz). I mean, there aren't even deleted/alternate scenes. Talk about rushed production.

Overall - 4.0

I like this movie. It's not quite as over-the-top as Date Night, but Knight and Day is still fun and entertaining enough that it makes me wanna' daydream about being a spy again. James Mangold is a really good director from all his work I've seen thus far, and it's a shame this movie didn't fair well during its theatrical run. But thanks to the ever-present star power of Tom Cruise, the rejuvenating allure (for me anyway) of Cameron Diaz, and some great chemistry, the film makes for a pretty enjoyable action/adventure rom-com. With near perfect A/V quality, but a set of extras that's severely lacking, I would recommend Knight and Day, though for no more than $10 (unless they double-dip with the package of extras it deserves). If you're like me and still appreciate Cruise, definitely pick it up. Otherwise, you may want to give this a rent if ""campy"" isn't your cup of tea.",1291248000,,9604,4.749550629119233

All DVD's should be sold like this!
We loved that it had a Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy in it all for $24.95.
Tom Cruise is great in this movie. It started out slow for me. The first 15 minutes I thought, ahh...Ok....then it got good. I loved Tom's Roy who was very witty, controlled and relaxed all while fighting the bad guy. There were plenty of chuckle moments, great but not over the top action sequences, not a lot of blood and no sexy scenes.

Cameron's June (I have to laugh when I say the name because of the way Tom's Roy says it) was a tad annoying to me with all the screaming but it was what it was.

I am on the fence with this movie. I watched it, didn't play on the computer or read which I tend to do when bored. It was entertaining but I felt that it could have been better.

4035143,4,B002ZG986E,"I'll admit up front that when I first put this movie in I was expecting another movie where Cameron Diaz played a ditzy, hopeless klutz who giggled non-stop and ended up with the good guy by film's end. I was only partly right and thankfully the good part. KNIGHT AND DAY worth watching.

Diaz stars as June Havens, a young woman on her way home after picking up some car parts she was after to restore a GTO. At the airport, she is accidentally bumped into by a stranger we later find is named Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) not once but twice. As we all know from the way he behaves (and from seeing the film's trailer umpteen times), Roy is a spy on a mission. When June is bumped from her plane, Roy says that might be a good thing.

But the group that is tracking down Roy decides otherwise and makes sure June gets on the plane, thinking perhaps there is a tie between the two. They converse a bit on the plane but when June decides to visit the powder room, the other passengers all attack Roy. It seems that all of them, including the pilot, are part of a group trying to take down Roy and retrieve something he has.

When June returns she doesn't notice everyone else slumped in their seats, but Roy lets her know that they're all dead, including the pilot. Roy has also slipped something in her drink that makes her drowsy. Before she passes out, Roy tells her to remember to tell no one they met and that should anyone approach her and tell her they're taking her somewhere ""safe"" or ""secure"" it means she will most likely disappear off the face of the earth. And then he lands the plane safely, thought somewhat mangled, in a corn field.

When June wakes the next day, she's home in her bed with notes from Roy reminding her to say she knows nothing. Will she do what he says? Of course not, this is a movie! Rather than keep quiet, she calls old flame Rodney and they meet to discuss what happened at a nearby diner. While eating who should show up but Roy who then whisks June away as a hostage, wounding Rodney in the process and rescuing her from would be captors.

The movie pretty much continues this way with Roy coming to June's rescue each time she disregards what he tells her. Eventually the two pair up and work together even though June has no training at all in the world of espionage. Roy comes around and lets her know that he was assigned to protect a young genius named Simon (Paul Dano) who may have found the perfect fuel cell, as big as a battery and as powerful as the sun. The problems began when his partner Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) turned traitor and framed Roy as one. Now he's doing his best to protect Simon, catch the bad guys who want the battery and rescue June all at the same time while he tries to clear his name.

The chemistry between Diaz and Cruise is there but not played upon near as much as the explosions and gunplay seen throughout the film. But even those scenes are cut short at times when June is rendered unconscious time and time again. Perhaps not enough to make it a downfall of the film, but it can be annoying at times. It always seems to be used when they make a change of locale going from the U.S. to the Alps and on to Spain.

Action fans will have plenty to walk away happy with here as both leads do a number of their own stunts adding a touch of reality to the mix. Car chases, gun battles, hand to hand combat and more are all on display most of the time here, mixed in with a small touch of comedy. As I said at the start, I was worried there'd be more than enough of this but they actually keep it to a minimum. Rather than play off of Diaz' normal ditzy girl they instead provide Cruise with most of the humor as he deftly snaps one liners left and right in the middle of the action scenes.

When released, the film didn't do the phenomenal business expected with the two stars and that's sad because it truly does offer a good time. It won't become a cure for illness, it won't solve the world's major problems in 109 minutes, but it will put a smile on your face as the action never stops and the romance blooms during the most dangerous of situations.

Cruise and Diaz turn in fine performances making it all seem so easy. Their characters aren't given a ton of depth but at the same time you feel like you known them both so well. If you're looking for a good time that offers a bit of diversion from day to day life then you'll find this one pure entertainment.

This is not Cruise's worst, nor his best but he sure looked good doing this film.  Cameron Diaz was just the right person for this as his 'love' side kick.  The action could have been a wee bit better and plot was a little unbelievable (a battery?).  But that was the whole point: just watch it and relax.  It was fun and had some funny moments and I think Tom is starting to get into comedy more than he is willing to admit.

This is a goofy kind of movie with a lot plot cliche's but it is actually fun to watch.  The part about his parents is funny if don't catch it from the beginning.

It seems that Tom Cruise has become the film industry's version of the wild child. After leaping over Oprah's sofa a few years back he transformed from the most bankable star in Hollywood to the fodder of Late Night talk show hosts. He has been characterized as unstable and maybe even a little delusional.

It was only a matter of time before a film would take advantage of Tom's new persona and cast him in a film that pokes fun at such an individual. Tom stars with Cameron Diaz in ""Knight and Day,"" opening today in theaters across America. Tom plays a spy, with much of the characteristics he has personally been accused of possessing. His by chance encounter with Cameron Diaz sets them off on an adventure around the world. Diaz' character June, becomes an unwilling participant in a game of espionage as she and Roy (Tom Cruise) fight to remain alive through a maze of unpredictable plot twists.

The film is packed with a plethora of action sequences with plenty of funny gags added to the mix. Some of the special effects are weak, but as long as the characters keep moving and entertain us, who cares? This is not a film that will win awards or even be number one at the box office this week.

They never got good grades without cheating, grew pot in their bedroom, and were always the one with the fake ID. You knew your parents didn't approve of them and yet, spending time with them was without a question some of the best times you had as a kid.

It seems that Tom Cruise has become the film industry's version of the wild child. After leaping over Oprah's sofa a few years back he transformed from the most bankable star in Hollywood to the fodder of Late Night talk show hosts. He has been characterized as unstable and maybe even a little delusional.

It was only a matter of time before a film would take advantage of Tom's new persona and cast him in a film that pokes fun at such an individual. Tom stars with Cameron Diaz in ""Knight and Day,"" opening today in theaters across America. Tom plays a spy, with much of the characteristics he has personally been accused of possessing. His by chance encounter with Cameron Diaz sets them off on an adventure around the world. Diaz' character June, becomes an unwilling participant in a game of espionage as she and Roy (Tom Cruise) fight to remain alive through a maze of unpredictable plot twists.

The film is packed with a plethora of action sequences with plenty of funny gags added to the mix. Some of the special effects are weak, but as long as the characters keep moving and entertain us, who cares? This is not a film that will win awards or even be number one at the box office this week.

For example, there are two or three action chases that you never see because the girl passes out as they start! The movie just skips to the end result, leaving you feeling cheated and not sure why things are blowing up all around the characters. Now, granted, I haven't seen this movie since it went to theatres months ago, so my memory is rusty. I remember thinking it was decent, but disappointing. It could have been much more, but failed to take several important routes that could have insured that. I will rent it when it releases to see if my opinion changes. But I wouldn't recommend buying it without seeing it first if you're somebody with a brain when it comes to movies. A lot of people buy movies just because they have action or horror, but the movies are completely retarded. People without movie brains don't mind this sort of thing.

4035287,3,B002ZG986E,"Cameron Diaz is June Havens, waiting for a flight at an airport, in order to attend her sister's wedding. She then bumps into Roy Miller, a handsome and mysterious guy played by Tom Cruise. In the next ten minutes June finds herself involved in an international conspiracy, fending off the chasers with guns. Roy says he is the only hope for her to survive, but can she really trust the man?

""Knight and Day"" doesn't take itself seriously. It is also a story of romance and suspense. Always suave and smiling, Tom Cruise is like Cary Grant (of ""Charade"") with James Bond-like ability to combat, which often looks almost superhuman. Perhaps that is why I started to care less and less about the characters they play. The storyline gets more and more incredible, with contrived action / romance set-pieces.

Clearly the leading stars are having fun, and though I am not particularly a fan of Cruise (or Diaz), their charms are undeniable. Still, even their star power cannot completely save the clichd script that fails to provide the excitement or sense of adventure. Most supporting actors (including Peter Sarsgaard, Paul Dano, Viola Davies, Jordi Molla and Maggie Grace) are sadly wasted and their characters are nothing but ciphers.

Aside from the ""star power,"" ""Knight and Day"" benefits from the impressive stunt work. Cars and motorbikes flip and fly through the air, and Cruise's hero misses his target, shooting guns and throwing punches, kicks and a knife, too. With the leading stars, the beautiful locations and the nice stunt work, ""Knight and Day"" is not boring. It is just the film lacks style, surprise, and imagination.",1288569600,7,1636,4.941818181818181

Cameron Diaz is June Havens a girl in the wrong place (airline flight filled with bad guys) at the wrong time (the plane is going to crash). The pace is often frenetic but the movie takes some time-outs to learn about each of the characters. Cruise and Diaz eventually fall for each other but not without some bumps along the way. I could go into the plot but it's better to just go in and enjoy this wonderful ride that is equal parts action flick, romance, and comedy.

4035366,3,B002ZG986E,"I'll freely admit I enjoyed Knight and Day - in which master criminal-cum-cop-cum-spy Tom Cruise embarks on an intercontinental gallivant, having (literally) stumbled into winsome, dippy and adorable Cameron Diaz - even if I don't really understand why. As I reflected on the film over the weekend it occurred to me that, critically speaking, I'd had my pocket picked. But at least I had been swindled as masterfully and outrageously as any of the many conspiracies in the movie. Before I realised what had happened, the thief had melted into the crowd. I can now barely remember the film. In fact, I'm not even entirely sure I went.

For there are few good reasons to enjoy this film other than the sheer gall the producers have in serving up something so preposterous, incoherent and, at the end of the day, lazy. But I still can't deny: I laughed a lot. I walked out feeling like this would have been a tenner well spent. It seemed like a good deal at the time; a couple of days later, I feel like I've had my wallet lifted.

Knight and Day belts along, and that's the key to its success: it never allows you to pause for a moment. Certainly, never long enough to gather your wits: it is a perpetual, preposterous, onslaught. Now, preposterous in this sort of film is okay; indeed, in the genre, mandatory; but there are limits, and with its unstoppable momentum Knight and Day barrels straight though them without a backward glance.

The set pieces - there are dozens of them, laid end on end - each go over the top in a way that even the Bond franchise would baulk at. They are, of course, leavened by humour and visual gags which excuse the ultra-violence (on an Alpine train, a man with a kitchen knife protruding from his chest saves himself from falling out a train window (briefly) by grabbing a string of sausages. It's Austria!). But there are so many set pieces, with so many different actors involved, that the necessary confusion - again, de rigueur in a romantic farce - is lost totally in the maelstrom of unnecessary incoherence and narrative laziness. Cruise escapes on two or three occasions from seemingly impossible situations (in a cell, hanging upside down, in a straight-jacket, swinging to and fro like a pendulum) without any explanation at all. But, then again, there was no good explanation of how he got there in the first place: easy come, easy go, I suppose.

None of the countless supporting characters has a hope of developing into anything more than a prop. Each, accordingly, fails to. The film gratuitously belts around the planet in search of exotic locales (I counted Boston, Kansas, Austria, Spain, the Azores and South America) and many of these seem to have been chosen purely to show off a CGI budget which, by its genre, the film really shouldn't need at all. There was no call for computerised charging bulls in Cadiz, cartwheeling motor-vehicles on divers freeways or buzzing space-aged jet-fighters in the Azores - but they threw them in anyway, perhaps in a magician's hopeful attempt to distract the viewer from the sleight of hand going on in front of his nose.

Diaz is her usual winsome, dippy and pretty self, and repeatedly shows off her winning/cloying (depending on your view) grin. Amusingly enough, she suffers from the deliberate running joke of being repeatedly drugged at critical junctures (on one occasion, even being subjected to a Vulcan Nerve-Pinch), but her character's arc is less plausible even than Cruise's. I suppose we should be grateful she even has one.
In fairness to Cruise and Diaz, they remain consummate professionals and make watchable something that could easily have been a train wreck.  They both nail every one of their one-liners. Could this film possibly have worked without such reliable A-listers at the helm? I doubt it.

So why is this film called Knight and Day, then? There is half a reason, but it isn't a good one (Roy Miller's ""real"" name is Knight and (symbolically!) a plastic knight features as a MacGuffin of sorts) but there's no reason for the Day bit as far as I can detect. The producers tried and (rightly) rejected a couple of other names (the irrelevant ""Wichita"" and the lacklustre ""Trouble Man"": they didn't consider ""Miller's Crossing"" sadly), but the general issue with the name might point to the film's main problem: it's hard to name a film which has has almost no identity. Knight and Day is just kind of there - it coalesces, like a traffic jam at rush hour.

It's different from a traffic jam in that, at least for the first hour, it's tremendously entertaining",1283126400,4,4578,4.7569269521410575
4035367,3,B002ZG986E,"Started out strong but lost its wind and by the third act barely crawled over the finish line. Cruise is shaping into a fine comedic actor who seems to have no problem making fun of his own image as an ""invulnerable"" action hero. He and Diaz have workable chemistry and the supporting actors and locations were great. My only real complaint for what was otherwise a light hearted Summer date movie is the inconsistent pacing and its failure to deliver what could have been a terrific black comedy. The first half was very similar to ""True Lies"" and had a lot of the same charm. The last half swerved off into conventional action movie fare.

OTOH, I think this is a good route for Cruise. Like ""The Governator"" Arnold, you can only be an action hero so long before you become a caricature. Arnold made the jump to making fun of himself before it was too late. Cruise seems to be going that way as well (Tropic Thunder). Maybe there is hope for Stalone?",1281657600,3,952,4.471264367816092

4035369,3,B002ZG986E,"I am reading the reviews of this movie wondering if I saw the same film.  Granted, it is pretty funny.  At times I am not sure it was intending to be funny, which doesn't necessarily bode well for the film, but it was humorous none the less.  As an omen, when I walked into the theater to see this film, five minutes before the start time, there was not a single person sitting in the seats.  Nobody.  That doesn't necessarily bode well for the film either.  Can we say strike two?  I did like the direction the movie was attempting to go though.  Veering away from the Mission Impossible genre just enough while still including enough action sequences to remind us that it was a Tom Cruise film.

I think at times the movie struggled with an identity.  I am not sure the writers/directors had made their decision on what kind of experience to portray, and that left me feeling like it was lacking direction.  I will say that Cameron Diaz and even in a couple of sequences, Tom Cruise, had me rolling on the floor laughing.  The broken drugged dream sequences were pretty imaginative as well, although the ending seemed a little farfetched.  I guess that goes hand in hand with the motorcycle scenes which are now becoming a signature of the spy series.  They are just flat out ridiculously laughable.

Anyway, Tom Cruise is our every day spy, who yet again is battling the bad guys.  This time it appears that the bad guys are really the good guys and somebody in our government is trying to betray our local hero.  He manages to bump into Cameron Diaz on a plane ride home and her life never does get back to reality.  I have heard people compare this to ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith which I think is pretty farfetched.  Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in no way can compare to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on any level at this point in their careers.  I did say at this point in their careers people.

So Tom has a really juicy battery, and the guy that invented it, and he is trying to protect both from pretty much everyone on the planet.  I wish I could say there was more to the plot, but that is really about it.  The rest of the movie jumps from one location to the next with Tom and Cameron fighting and killing a whole lot of people.  I am sure I will get roasted for this review, but when Tom Cruise stops mid scene, during the heat of a gun battle to give Cameron a loving kiss hello, mostly to shut her up mind you, he somehow manages to avoid a few hundred bullets without even trying.  That really sums up the entire movie.

So if you are interested in a mindless movie that absolutely will make you laugh and some impossible to believe farfetched action sequences, then this is your movie.  I would highly suggest having a six pack of beers before flipping on the go switch though.  Everything looks a little better with a six pack and that might be just what this movie needs.  I wonder if theaters will at some point in time start passing out tequila shots with the 3D glasses.  Just think how much money they could save.  People would be seeing all kinds of affects, and the cost of the films would be drastically reduced.

Average film, but not a complete waste of time if you have already seen most of the other movies playing.

We open to see Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the airport, waiting for his delayed flight.  He is actually a former CIA Agent, turned rogue over the Zephyr battery.  By accident (sort of) he keeps bumping into Cameron Diaz (June).  June is trying to go home to Witchita for her sister's wedding and is carrying around some car parts so she can restore daddy's antique GTO.  They wind up on the same airplane together where he quickly has to begin fighting for his life.  This flight begins a whole series of comedic antics and adventures as everyone is chasing Roy, trying to get the battery, including the CIA.  Of course, that means June is now involved.  Some nice scenery as Roy and June are running from Kansas, to Manhattan, Austria/Swiss Alps, Germany, New England, Spain, and some island in the middle of nowhere.

4035373,5,B002ZG986E,"Knight and Day is the perfect movie for all those guys who have sat through a chick flick they didn't wanna and all those ladies who have sat through an action movie that they didn't care for.  The movie combines the best of both worlds.

Tom Cruise might have all kinds of issues these days but none of them show in this movie, he combines the best of his younger action days with some sly comedy that constantly works.

Cameron Diaz plays the the 30 something lady who is unattached and looking for love and manages to play it with a fair amount of passion and some style.

Both actors deliver but its the writing that delivers more, the use of gaps in the narrative as characters are drugged or knocked out as links really works.  It alleviates the need for actual resolutions for some situations.  It gets rid of a bunch of the boring stuff.  The locations are great and keep the picture fresh.

The movie keeps us guessing as the characters are both comic and serious, and we wonder to the very end where things are going to end.  The action works and we find ourselves actually interested in if the boy will get the girl.

So it works as both an action movie and a chick flick at the same time.  Therefore it is the perfect date movie/makeup movie particularly if you are angry over something.

If at all possible you want to see it at the movies.",1278720000,,1353,4.346613545816733
4035374,2,B002ZG986E,"I was sober when I saw this train wreck of a film so perhaps I'd have something better to say about it if there was some substance or other running through my bloodstream. Let me say first off that I'm not one of those malicious Tom Cruise haters. I have enjoyed many of his films even if I think his acting abilities are limited. He often times picks very good directors to work with and then brings his star power to their projects. Kubrick, Spielberg and P.T. Anderson are just a few of the names that quickly spring to mind.

Regardless, whatever Cruise and Diaz were thinking when they read this screenplay, the finished product doesn't work. It constantly undermines it's own momentum at every turn with another absurd plot twist any viewer could see from a mile away. The script is rotten, the direction by James Mangold is poor and the grinning face of Cruise in this summer action vehicle grows more tiresome every minute. Cameron Diaz is not as annoying but pretty close, playing the ditzy blonde only half convincingly. Perhaps she's more convincing in real life?

While watching this atrocious movie I was reminded more than a little bit of ""True Lies"" since the plot revolves around a regular gal getting involved with a world class spy who can kill anyone and get out of any tricky situation. Well, the James Cameron directed True Lies is a true showcase of how to do a big-budget summer action comedy right. It's an audience pleaser in the highest degree even if the film is breezy and superficial. Cruise and everyone involved in ""Knight and Day"" clearly wanted to have fun in this same breezy, carefree manner and maybe they did but the audience does not share their enthusiasm. I was restless throughout the whole film, hoping that soon enough the movie would get interesting but it rarely did. The people I was with were bored out of their minds as well. Looking around the audience I sensed an unease, as if the people knew they were watching a big budget turkey of a movie. Many audience members were constantly getting up and going to the bathroom and this was in a barely filled movie theater no less. It was all just too whimsical, fantastical and really smacked of half-baked schtick.

Another horrible feature of the movie was the C.G.I. I have seen plenty of terrible computer generated imagery in recent summer blockbusters but Knight and Day has to be one of the worst. The highway chase scene with the flying, tumbling cars defied all laws of physics and looked completely absurd, trivial in fact. There was no weight to the action scenes at all. Compare this silly scene with the harrowing bridge chase in True Lies when two Harrier jets use missiles to take out multiple terrorist targets and then Arnold Schwarzenegger hanging off the side of a helicopter rescues his wife played by Jamie Lee Curtis out of a moving on-fire limousine before it flies off a collapsed bridge. Now that's big-budget summer popcorn fun! Knight and Day has terrible action scenes and can't even compensate for that with chemistry from Cruise and Diaz. It just all seems too preposterous. If you're going to make a semi-surrealistic action flick like this, then go all the way and stop trying to ground it in some of kind of reality.

There were a few good points I wanted to mention. One was the cool way the director edited the sequence when Cruise drugs Diaz, escapes from his captors and escorts her half way around the world. The sequence is all filmed from her subjective, semi-conscious point of view. A nice part in a bad movie. But when the roles are reversed and Diaz rescues Cruise later on, the same subjective viewpoint from Cruise seems stale and tired. The location shooting is also very fine as the characters globe trot everywhere from Salzburg, Austria to Spain and unspecified islands. Ultimately all the scene changes wear you out and you grow bored. Like I said before, if you're under the influence of some substance and it's got you all giggly, perhaps you'll enjoy yourself with this movie, otherwise you have been warned. It's one of the worst films either actor has participated in and easily at the bottom of the barrel for director James Mangold's career.",1278633600,7,4193,4.708446866485014
4035375,3,B002ZG986E,"James Mangold's ""Knight and Day"" is a romantic-spy-adventure comedy that exists solely as an excuse for Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to exert their considerable charm on movie audiences and each other. It didn't remind me of recent romantic adventures like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" or ""Killers"" so much as it did a romantic version of ""The In-Laws,"" with Cruise as Peter Falk and Diaz as an infinitely more curvaceous Alan Arkin. The first half of ""Knight and Day"" is as funny and thrilling as anyone could wish; unfortunately, both the plot momentum and the storytelling logic start breaking down slightly more than halfway through, about the time Cruise and Diaz get to Salzburg (gorgeously photographed by Phedon Papamichael). But Cruise and Diaz, both playing the distilled essences of their screen images, are devastatingly charismatic throughout, and the many action scenes are state-of-the-art, especially a multi-vehicle chase scene through the streets of Sevilla (actually Cadiz). Fine actors such as Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis and Paul Dano show up briefly to speak their stock lines and collect their paychecks. Cruise and Diaz are the entire movie, and you already knew that going in. If you like them, you'll like ""Knight and Day.""",1278374400,,1241,5.17910447761194
