A terrific cast including Felicia Day, Kavan Smith, Greg Bryk, and Stephen McHattie each delivered terrific overall performances. The premise was a new take on the Red Riding Hood theme and is really a great idea. The special effects/ CGI were better then the other reviews may have you believe, and fun to watch.",1326326400,15,386,4.6911764705882355
4890730,1,B005TG8156,"A movie filmed with the assistance of the Canadian Tax Credit Bureau must raise a few flags in the discerning viewer. Actors that have to their film credits video games and TV series/movies raises another flag. That this is a made for TV movie is yet another flag. OK, enough flags raised and the movie hasn't even started. Yes, acting was beginner weak (no offense meant), script and dialogue were so weak that the fast forwarding button was the only escape.
Plot:
The descendants in a rural area that I assume is Canada are in a truce with local werewolves except we don't see anyone outside of the family and a boyfriend for most of the movie. One werewolf decides to break the truce and create a little fun sucking a little neck blood from a few people that strangely seem to show up out of nowhere. A couple members of the family and the boyfriend are in law enforcement, although you would never know it from their actions, especially in decision making and really especially in using weapons. Anyway all but one of the family die and the rogue werewolf and his minions also die via silver tools e.g. bullets, arrows, knives. The CGI of people turning into wolves was OK except most of the wolf CGI action was of them standing around while looking really emaciated i.e. skinny.  Wolves when dying turn into the now popular special effect of ashes and not the classical human form.",1326240000,8,1386,4.588709677419355

4890736,3,B005TG8156,"I have to be honest, I only watched this because it had Felicia Day in it.  I loved her in the Guild and I think that may have turned me off of this movie a little bit.  Because every time I saw her on screen, in my mind all I could see was the neurotic Codex.

The story itself has potential, but the acting is just so stiff and the actors themselves have very little chemistry between them.  When Red kisses her boyfriend, you could tell that it was a stage kiss and I didn't believe that the characters were in love or that they cared about each other.

Now the weapons they used to fight the werewolves looked really cool, and the movie gets props for that!  Also the werewolves looked neat and the CGI they used made them look like they could have been real.  I did enjoy all the fighting, and also how Gabriel raised an army of werewolves to hunt down the werewolf hunters.  The final boss battle left a little to be desired, and I did wonder who the little girl at the very end was when Red was reading to her.  Was she pregnant with her fianc's baby before he died?  We never are told that she was pregnant so it's a little confusing.

In conclusion, it's a made for TV SyFy Channel movie.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and we shouldn't either.  It's good for background noise or if you just want to see Felicia in a TV movie, or if you are looking for a sci-fi movie that is just okay.  If you like werewolves or Felicia Day, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you don't like either of those things, you may want to look elsewhere for entertainment.",1449446400,,1560,4.205387205387205

There's granny (Rosemary Dunsmore) and Red's two brothers, we're expected to believe they are all that stands between us and a raging horde of rebel werewolves led by the sassy geezer wolf Gabriel (Steven McHattie doing what McHattie always does, his villain de jour).  The clash between these two groups goes as expected.  The double ending is a bit arbitrary.  That they thought to turn this into a TV series is more than a little puzzling.  That they obviously rethought then abandoned the idea was probably the smartest thing they could have done.  There's just nothing here to merit something on a continuing basis.  As a pilot movie, it goes through the motions doing just what was expected and nothing else.  As Red, Felicia Day doesn't inspire a sense of great strength or leadership qualities.

4890755,2,B005TG8156,"Well, you can tell this had the budget of an inner city charity.  It is surprising and admirable how well the actors and film makers did.  Unfortunately, there is a lot wrong with this film.

Let's cover the cool parts.  The werewolves mid-change look incredible--scary and realistic effects.  The acting is much better than you'd expect.  The hunters are natural, as are the two main werewolf villains.  Hauer and his right hand girl are seriously frightening.

Here's the sad thing: everything else in this movie is sort of a downhill ride into a bummer of an evening.  When the werewolves fully transform, they look ridiculous.  Like CGI versions of lanky, starving, reject werewolves from a cartoon.  Seriously laughable and corny.  Then, of course, the action involving these special effects is a joke.

So, you get some tension built.  You wonder what the confrontations will be like.  Then you get CGI nonsense.  YET the transformations and mid-change effects are excellent!  How the heck did this happen?  It's as if two different movies were spliced together during a drunken nightmare!  What a way to ruin a movie!

Add to that the fact that the werewolves are dirty hobo's--literally--and you end up laughing more than cringing in fear.  How could a pack of super-strong monsters with super-senses not manage to steal some soap, a shower, clean clothes, some camping equipment at least?  There are actually homeless people in real life functioning better than these werewolves.

The story is weak, predictable, and passable.  If not for the occasional well-done effects and the actors, this movie would be absolutely UN-watchable.  As it is, the film is just a semi-reasonable way to pass time.  Which stinks, because you get glimpses of a great horror movie every once in a while.  With the same cast, a big budget, a skilled writer, and a skilled special effects team, Red: Werewolf Hunter could easily have been another Underworld.

While there he gets bitten by a werewolf and puts a strain on their relationship as her family hunts werewolves. The film had a decent story line, unfortunately the execution was less than stellar. The dialog reeked and the special effects were 1980ish. The hunting scenes were not very powerful. If werewolves are people during the day, they could use guns for killing also...just a thought. The acting didn't come across as strong.

In one scene the werewolves have three people in shackles. The girl in the red sweater has on shackles so large around her wrist, she could easily slip her whole hand through them. What's the point? In order to kill a werewolf, its heart must be pierced with silver, although for some werewolves their heart is through their stomach.

There was promise of Felicia Day whooping werewolf butt and potentially getting down with a really attractive leading man. This should have had ""Win!"" handed over on a silver platter. Then came the rest of the movie. Painfully bad dialogue, hollow delivery lacking chemistry (or mind-numbingly over the top in the case of the big bad), weak CGI... so sad. As a would-be story writer, I can see what this was originally intended to be versus the hatchet job it became. I have to imagine the results must be horribly frustrating for those who shared that vision and watched it get flushed down the pooper.

4890775,2,B005TG8156,"So where does one begin with a review of this mess.

The writing....lukewarm at best would be fair. The story has some of the largest plot holes I have ever seen outside of an Ed Wood film...and that's saying a lot. Repeated use of the terms werewolf, Nathan, and hunter get to the point where it becomes more fun counting how long before they are uttered again. The writer simply didn't get a passing grade on this project in school but was so in love with the premise figured it would still be workable if it could have some geek appeal in its casting of a fan favourite Felicia (please be my next wife) Day.

Special effects...hmm what makes them so very special is they allow you to use your imagination....constantly. Budget constraints kept production from showing the werewolves crisp up Buffy or Blade style treating the viewer instead to bursts of flame behind any convenient objects, cars, walls, crewmembers.

Editing and sound. Completely random edits make the film feel as though you are always missing something. It also allows for increasingly large plot holes to develop. Much of the time audio sounds culled from a studio voice over session with odd echoes and quality.

Now to the acting. Normally I like the cast. On paper it should have worked as I have seen them all perform in other projects and been impressed by their varying ranges and strengths. In this film though we are treated to seeing some of the most wooden performances this side of a marionette convention.

Watching Red made me laugh, yet not in a good way. It made me get involved by shouting corrections at the screen. You will be left to wonder why they simply didn't use silver bullets in machine guns as they seem to have an abundance of it to begin with.

Advice on this one.
If you like Felicia Day and want a peek...watch it, but do it with a friend as you won't be able to not have a few quips here and there.
Once the film is done though, you will want some hot water and soap to get the stink off.",1354233600,8,1994,4.479338842975206

Although this is a Syfy film, I found it entertaining enough and entertainment is the name of the game. The characters & locations are good and effects are decent; the story keeps your attention, and Felicia looks really good in tight jeans.

4890777,3,B005TG8156,"It was made in conjunction with the SyFy channel. So, I was not expecting much. Most of their movies are pretty weak. I saw it has Felicia Day in it and I suddenly expected more. Yes, I really wanted this movie to be good.

Although there are some scenes where she is undeniably hot, Felicia Day's talents were vastly under-used. She normally carries a story with her performance even without any kind of budget or special effects. Instead, her energy and acting ability only peek out here and there.

This movie has some really good moments and pretty good effects. However, there were too many holes to really enjoy it. Some were caused by editing. Some were caused by weak-ass moves in the writing and/or directing.

For instance, an experienced werewolf hunter has a werewolf in a jail cell and can't manage to kill it with three shots from a rifle (silver bullets) from five feet away. The werewolf is shaking the bars and the locked cell door just sort of swings open. Oh, come on!!!! I could have written that scene better with a few minutes of thought. ANYONE could! Garbage like that really drags down the good scenes. Before long, it was hard not to focus on the flaws.

But now a new werewolf has come to town, promising the local lycanthropes that he'll teach them to shapeshift at will, not just when the moon is full. The plan to kill him becomes a lot more personal when Nathan turns out to have been bitten -- and the werewolf plans to kill or turn the whole Sullivan family.

""Red: Werewolf Hunter"" is neither the worst nor the best werewolf flick I've ever seen. It has a nice atmosphere, mixing the gothic, wintry quality of a small town with leather coats, silver and harpoons. Yes, there is an actual scene where Felicia Day stands on a rooftop and harpoons werewolves. That is awesome.

Unfortunately, both the werewolves and hunters are... not handled well. The hunters come across as inept, stumbling into obvious traps that seasoned werewolf hunters should have seen. And the werewolves are pretty 2-dimensional -- we never really see any of them being anything except bloodthirsty savages, and none of them have any doubts about what they're doing.

Also, there is a HUGE continuity error late in the story. Without revealing too much, we're told that if they kill a werewolf who infected someone, the victim will be cured. And it DOESN'T HAPPEN.

So what compensates for this? Well, the rather shocking ending, which adds a bittersweet note to everything that happened. It's more realistic and raw than I expected, and that's good.

Also, the cast is quite solid -- Felicia Day is a bit weepy at times, but she's otherwise excellent as a buttkicking werewolf hunter, and Kavan Smith is a solid, believable FBI agent (although it was trippy to see Codex smooching Deputy Andy). And there's a round of great performances by Stephen McHattie, Rosemary Dunsmore and the sexy Greg Bryk.

""Red: Werewolf Hunter"" could have used more fleshed-out werewolves and competent hunters, but as cheapo werewolf SyFy movies go, this is a decent one.",1331856000,4,2534,4.8631090487238975
4890779,3,B005TG8156,"Even geek goddesses sometimes phone it in. RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER is yet another take on Little Red Riding Hood. Except that, in terms of watchability, it's nowhere near the realm of THE COMPANY OF WOLVES or Reese Witherspoon's FREEWAY or even the animated parody HOODWINKED. At least in 2011's RED RIDING HOOD, one can commend Amanda Seyfried for her very good performance while damning the script that let her down. The highlight of RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER for me was ogling Felicia Day in her black leathers. RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER, a 2010 SyFy television horror feature, may fill you with dread, but, embarrassingly, not in the way the film intends. Ennui sets in pretty quickly.

Virginia ""Red"" Sullivan (Day) is a modern-day descendant of Little Red Riding Hood. ""Red"" isn't a fond nickname as much as it is an honorific bestowed on the first-born daughter in each generation of a family of werewolf hunters. A truce exists between the Sullivan clan and the remaining werewolf packs. Providing the werewolves stay deep, deep in the woods, the Sullivans will desist from declaring it open season on lycanthropes. Still, the Sullivans aren't about to have a yard sale on black leather threads and their arsenal of silver weaponry.

But then a rogue werewolf named Gabriel (Stephen McHattie) comes along and shatters the tentative peace. Although it's never really explained, Gabriel is a terrifying new breed that can phase at will, who isn't at all restrained by the lack of a full moon. Gabriel has seized leadership of the pack and now he's making a move on the Sullivans. Luckily for the humans, FBI agent Virginia Sullivan picked the perfect time to visit her family homestead. But she may regret bringing along her fiance, fellow federal agent Nathan Kessler (Kavan Smith). Some family secrets aren't meant to be shared.

The cast's uniformly wet blanket acting is infectious; the movie, like its actors, immediately assumes a leaden monotone. I'm a big fan of Felicia Day and was surprised at how detached she seemed. There's no chemistry to ignite those scenes between her and Kavan Smith. In fact, more sparks fly from the combustible werewolves than from the two leads. It's ironic that Kavan Smith actually exhibits more soulfulness in his role of the robotic Deputy Andy in EUREKA. Anyway, I'm still getting used to the notion of Felicia Day as a steely action heroine. Her patented nerdy, gamine charm is pretty non-existent in this flick. Besides, she's more nails in her recent web series DRAGON AGE: REDEMPTION (which is also not her best work). Stephen McHattie - who effectively plays the sinister preacher on HAVEN - goes overboard with the strident speeches. He also seems to be channeling Lance Henriksen's weathered facial wrinkles and grooves.

RED: WEREWOLF HUNTER lifts a page from the Buffyverse in that it features werewolf corpses who disintegrate into flames, maybe because it shares the same budget restrictions. The CG-rendered werewolves don't look polished; they move jarringly. Another concern is the tepid lack of bloodletting and gore and action set pieces. I'm all for establishing a foreboding atmosphere, but this is supposed to be an action horror film. At some point, the fur and silver shivs must fly. But they don't fly enough. Most egregiously, the heroine fails to engage the viewer, and I do somewhat fault Felicia Day for that. I wasn't invested at all in her character or her derring-dos or in her relationship with her fiance (which does become a focal point of the plot). It'll take repeated viewings of ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar?"" on YouTube to wash off this sense of being let down.",1330300800,16,3634,4.962233169129721
