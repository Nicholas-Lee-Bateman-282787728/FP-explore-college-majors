3664013,5,B000RQ4T4K,"PLOT...
Monika isn't like other young women, she shares her flat with Rob, A corpse which serves as the object of her affections, one day she meets Mark a good natured man and finds herself torn between the living and the dead, can she have a normal relationship with a living breathing man when her rotting true desire is home in her bed!

This movie truly is as messed up as it sounds, like the original don't watch on a full stomach or you may loose it, the sequel may not be as original as the first movie but its just as well made and just as disturbing, the two main actors are great and carry the story well, Monika M has to do some disgusting things, the effects once again are simple but good, nice soundtrack score, this certainly will not be everyone's cup of tea but horror it certainly is none the less, for a low budget movie it has quite an impact and you just want to keep watching to see how much further it can go, if you like weird messed up things then the nekromantik movies are way up there, creepy and disturbing and probably one of the best messed up crazy gory end sequences to a movie ever! be sure to check it out.

3664014,4,B000RQ4T4K,"Well, Monika is one beautiful and interesting young lady...she just has some fairly serious issues in the relationship department. I don't have much to add to other positive reviews other than to say that my favorite scene (though tending to interrupt the narrative flow, or at least what there is of it) is where she's randomly transformed into a sultry chanteuse singing her love of corpses/skeletons, with ""John Boy Walton"" tickling the ivories. Somehow it works for me, though it's just as f***** up as the rest of the picture. I'm now curious about the original Nekromantik but I'm not sure how much I want to see it.",1448323200,,622,4.768518518518518

3664023,5,B000RQ4T4K,"This movie is beautiful despite some of the cruel parts in it. It shows that fascination and disgust are twins in the same hell/heaven. It's like being in a separate world. The musical scene that occurs near the end of the movie is one of my all time favourite scenes in any movie ever, it's morbidly beautiful and when the piano player looks at the viewer it is as if you are being stared into your very soul. It also shows the mind of Monica and her taboo desires. Highly recommended to watch, be absorbed into this dark art...a masterpiece",1426723200,,542,4.43
3664024,5,B000RQ4T4K,"Warning this movie contains nudity, graphic sex and bloody violence that is highly offensive so if you are offended by any of these PLEASE  DO NOT watch this movie because you get exactly what the title suggests.  This shocking sick symbolic sequel starts immediately when the first film ends. It is a love story of a beautiful nurse who tries to overcome her taboo desires when she falls in love with someone. The first act is shocking, the second act purposefully slow which will annoy gore hounds as it builds up to an even more shocking climax than the first one. Each film symbolizes a different part of Germany, East vs West. The first film had frequent shocking scenes, one after another along with a dark sense of humor and and an unforgettable double ending. This film has a darker serious tone with a slow burn that leads to a even more disturbing violent, bloody unforgettable double ending than the first movie had.
  The director wisely made a different movie than the first one instead of just repeating the first one. Those who like numerous gory scenes with humor may prefer the first film but the viewers who enjoy a darker more disturbing film will enjoy this sequel better than the first.",1426464000,,1207,4.679245283018868

3664030,3,B000RQ4T4K,"This sequel to ""Nekromantik"" is pretty weak to me. The first one is filled with magic, whilst ""Nekromantik 2"" is just overly long and dull. A young woman named Monika(Monika M.)takes home a corpse of Robert, the necrophile murderer who committed suicide at the end of the first film. Then she finds a live boyfriend-his name is Mark and he has a job dubbing porn movies. They strike up a relationship, but soon all hell breaks loose...""Nekromantik 2"" is a slow-moving film filled with meaningless sequences. The special effects are excellent Robert's rotting corpse is disturbingly real. The climax has to be seen to be believed it's so sick and horrendously gory that it won't be easily forgotten. This is perhaps the most graphic depiction of sexual violence ever captured on film, therefore it's a crying shame that the rest of the film is so pointless.

3664034,4,B000RQ4T4K,"I can attest that Jrg Buttgereit's original Nekromantik is one of the best foreign or horror films I've ever seen. OK, we'll call it horror if we must although I see this series as more of a psychological meditation on the fear of death and the fascination with all things dead. Although there is plenty of darkness and morbidity, I still say Buttgereit's artistry is worthy of more than just your average cringe-inducing slasher flick. Having said that, it's easy to understand why the film has had such a shelf life or a much deserved yet underground cult status.

Nekromantik ended on a rather somber note. Hey, it's the nature of a beast. If you make a film about necrophilia, you are bound to witness some unbearable tragedy as does our lead character Rob in the original film. Nekromantik 2 replays the rather graphic if not bloody suicide although this time around the montage is absent of color. I would strongly suggest watching the original first or you're going to be a tad disenfranchised or rather confused for a few moments.

Monika (Monica M.) slowly makes her way through the graveyard to dig up our fresh, young corpse. Initially, we are unsure whether Betty's character(Rob's girlfriend in the first film) has been replaced by a different actress or if we are being introduced to a new female character altogether this time around with similar characteristics. Later on, we do see Betty visit Rob's grave only to discover it has already been robbed which helps the viewer. We then realize that Monica M is Buttgereit's new creation & we are about to take on yet another journey into the realms of darkness.

After bringing Rob's corpse back to her apartment, Monika proceeds to undress the cadaver and my readers can guess the rest. I won't go into specifics here but I think it's fair to say you already know what to expect if you're reading this review. Upon cleaning the corpse, she then decides to take a few Polaroids of herself with our deceased Rob.

Not long after spending time with the deceased, Monika meets Mark at the local theater where his date has stood him up yet once again. He offers her the ticket as a courtesy and it would the two of them have hit it off or things might take a turn for the better. Mark earns his keep dubbing porn for a living but appreciates the avantguard cinema as it has nothing to with his line of work. He knows nothing of Monika nor her extreme fascination with death.

Shortly after establishing what would seem to be a solid relationship with Mark, Monika then proceeds to dispose of Rob's human remains save the head and the genitals.

Even though the viewer still feels a bit uneasy about the newfound relationship, many will believe that our lead has finally found true love at last and will eventually give up on copulating with the recently deceased. Sadly, her fascination with the dead or dying actually increases and Mark begins to notice things aren't quite as kosher with his new lady friend as he would like. Unfortunately, he's in love and is well past the point of no return.

While not as good nor as well paced as the original, I really applaud Buttgereit for not retreading the same territory on the second time around. I also give him kudos for touching upon the feminist aspect while actually giving the viewer what they really want. SEX AND GORE. Not to say that Nekromantik 2 is just a filthy blood bath as the film continues to carefully examine & clearly define the unnatural ways that people themselves deal with death or their feelings about intimacy. Nekromantik is a bold series and I only wish our director would've granted us one more film for the road although I can't really imagine what more he could possibly do with the given material.

Nekromantik 2 also strays from some of the dark humor of the original although the hallucinogenic scenes are still to be found as well as a few montages of animal cruelty. In Buttgereit's defense, these shots of animal cruelty weren't made exclusively for the Nekromantik series and we shouldn't indite the director for such. These shots were made of humans destroying animals in situations that take place everyday. While I do not condone the torture or killing of animals, I strongly believe that Buttgereit uses this footage to further elucidate the madness of his lead characters.

Ironically, Daktori Larenz (lead actor in the first Nekromantik) lends his scope of expertise to the soundtrack here which is quite brilliant. The music is neither campy nor too creepy but gives the perfect pitch to induce a rather moody atmosphere. I only wish I could buy a legit copy of this film on DVD just to obtain the soundtrack which exists on the second disc.

Not a film for all tastes of course as much of the material would only appeal to weirdos like myself who have that acquired taste but Nekromantik 2 is definitely not a waste of time either. Grab it if you can still find it. It's getting to be harder and harder to find in local markets these days. Sad.",1308528000,,4996,4.6670454545454545
3664035,3,B000RQ4T4K,"All the reviews I read about this movie were pretty much dead on.  This is the most depressing and disturbing movie I've ever seen.  I've seen a multitude of horror-gore movies in my time(35+years) and considered myself unshockable, but this movie proved me wrong.  I've watched it once and have no desire for another viewing.  Watch it if you feel you need to as I did, but I imagine once will be enough.",1302998400,,405,4.506849315068493
3664036,1,B000RQ4T4K,"This movie is really pointless.  I bought it due to its reputation.  I was very disappointed.  So a woman hears of the first corpse romance through newspaper articles and goes to steal his corpse.  She ends up developing feelings for the corpse and taking pictures of her and the corpse, watching movies together, ect...eventually having sex with the corpse.  Ahhh...then comes the conflict....she is torn between the corpse and a human man.  The movie was disappointing...not shocking...just somewhat pointless.  The mucical interlude with the girl singing and the guy playing piano with the lit candles...Yeah, I could have done without that sceen.  It was pointless and not even connected to the film not to mention a complete waste of time and assault upon my sences.",1291593600,,771,5.112
3664037,4,B000RQ4T4K,"One wasn't enough? Had to drudge further into the demented, unstable minds of women with a sickening desire to have sex with corpses, huh? BRAVO!!! Mark and Monika, what a cute couple. Mark dubs old porn films and Monika is a nurse who can't get off unless it's with a dead body. Need I say more? Sure, the SPFX on the corpse in this film are fantastic, very realistic and gnarly. The love scenes are ghastly, following suit of part 1, and the subject matter is just as explicit. The downfall of this film is the filler, the filler in the original didn't quite tie in but it served it's purpose by darkening the mood without losing the audience's attention. This filler is just that, filler. It somewhat drags the film a lot longer than it should have been, mostly through the middle. The end of this film will blow your mind, just takes a little while to get there. Nekromantik 2 (Limited Edition, 2-Disc Unrated Set) runs about 103 min and is filled with extras, outtakes and the making of. The very well done goremantic sex scenes are superb and the body parts and ground meat look like they came from the butcher shop, very, very nice! Of course, this film is definitely not suited for everyone obviously, be sure you are ready to handle this kind of subject matter as well as your audience! 4 stars for the shear shock value that is delivered here.

Enjoy more of the forbidden, black art of rotten sex and soak in all the decaying tissues, bodily fluids and gases that this film has to offer!!!",1276646400,,1500,4.474452554744525
3664038,4,B000RQ4T4K,"Rob's recently deceased corpse is exhumed from the grave by a woman with the same necrophilic obsession he had shared in his life, who then brings his body home to fulfill her own sexual desires. After a chance meeting with a charming younger man, she attempts to maintain a normal relationship with her new love interest, but he is unable to satisfy her... At least, while he is still breathing. NEKROMANTIK 2 thrusts the audience back into a world of depravity and perversion, though this time Buttgereit handles the subject matter with a more tasteful and serious approach. Even with the minimal dialog, he is able to convey the inner struggle of a woman that is a prisoner of her own morbid desires through the mounting tension and visual storytelling. The film is less gruesome and over the top than its predecessor (though no less shocking), with the clear exception of the finale, which is arguably even more revolting and unexpected than the climax of the original. Pacing becomes Buttgereit's greatest challenge as he extends trivial scenes to unnecessary lengths in an attempt to justify the film as art. NEKROMANTIK 2 can be dissected as a metaphor for a diseased new relationship, praised as a daring hybrid of Exploitation and Art House, or enjoyed as just another sickening shocker, but either way, Buttgereit manages to create an equal to his controversial first film.

3664039,1,B000RQ4T4K,"I've read a lot of reviews for this film, and picked up both films from a store in the city after just being curious and looking to add to my horror collection. I enjoyed the first film very much, but this one is just terrible. I heard  it was nowhere near as good as the first, but i didn't expect it to be THIS BAD.

Just as others have said, there are a bunch of pointless scenes where nothing is being said or done. The first sex scene with the corpse is long, not shocking and just plain boring. This is supposed to be taboo i guess, but it really just puts you to sleep.

I know the director wanted to do something different and not just rehash the first film, but it could have been so much better. If you edit out the few gore sequences, its more like a boring date movie than anything else.

If you can find the find the first one, pick that up. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this snoozefest.",1214006400,,914,4.061111111111111

Jorg Buttgeriet is a true horror movie fan, opposed to a lot of Italian and American movies that were trying to make a couple of dollars, and I feel that ""Nekro"" 1&2 are the only movies that hold a flame to the mighty ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Two is not as good as the first but very close. A lot of critics put this down just because of how far it went, but thats why I like it.

3664041,2,B000RQ4T4K,"Despite the wonderfully perverse sex scene at the end this film is barely worth watching.

Wordless for the first 19 minutes the film opens with the graphic suicide scene from the ending of part one.  We then get 8 horrible, boring minutes of a woman digging up a grave.  She takes the guy from part one home and makes boring love to the corpse.  The film goes on like this until she meets a new guy (he's alive by the way).  They go to the theater and watch a long, meaningless film about birds.  They go to the zoo and to the fair and I nearly went to sleep.

The live guy is fond of the girl but senses something is wrong when he finds a chopped off wang in the refrigerator!  More stuff happens including an intensely graphic dissection of a seal then finally the sex scene that almost...almost...makes this art house snoozer worth watching.

3664043,1,B000RQ4T4K,"I remember reading some advisors review of this from another , the critic a supposed veteran named Mr Bracken bragged about this film like it was as gross and coolest movie ever.

The Nekromantik movies are just plain gross, stupid and deserved to be in the trash. German Director Jorg Buttgereit is just some  sicko who obviously has mental problems. I cannot imagine  how he made a sequel to the equally incompetent ""Nekromantik""  but it goes to show the vast difference of movie trash from  Europe compared to the US.

The story revolves around a disturbed woman who digs up a corpse  and makes love to it. The nurse actually doubles as a voiceover  for porn film, she has a loser boyfriend who has no interest in her, until she uses some manipulation on her part.

(Spoilers)

Skip to the last sick moments of the film and we see this  sick woman dismember the corpse and then kill her boyfriend while they're having sex. Its utterly mindless and stupid shlock  that really serves no purpose except to gross you out

There are no clever ""sequences"" here or any clever psychology  at work, the characters are all forgettable.  Nekromantik 2 has the same low budget as the first one, but it looks cheaper than the first. It's basically the first movie with a twist that it's a woman necrophiliac and not a man. Still skip this stinker unless your into this sort of thing.",1109980800,,1373,4.592592592592593
3664044,4,B000RQ4T4K,"In 1987, German art-house director Jorg Buttgereit unleashed ""Nekromantik"" on an unsuspecting festival circuit provoking waves of outrage and the film to be banned in several countries, including his own.  Meanwhile, the film was gaining a rabid cult following from fans of depraved and trash cinema who clamored for a sequel.  In 1991 Buttgereit submitted to the demands of the underground and filmed Nekromantik 2, a film so depraved and dangerous in its insinuations it was actually seized by German authorities folowing its premiere back in 1991.  Having seen the original Nekromantik several years ago, I never bothered trying to find the sequel due to the profound unease the first film had left on me.  Given Barrel entertainment's recent packaging of Nekromantik 2 in a 2-disc deluxe edition, curiosity got the best of me and I knew I had to give it a try.
Nekromantik 2 opens up with a flashback of the climactic scene of the first film, where Rob commits suicide.  That scene is replayed in all its glory, and it remains quite the shocker.  Meanwhile, a young single lady living in Berlin (the gorgeous Monika M.) has been reading several newspaper clippings about Rob's suicide and decides to dig up his body from the morgue.  She drags the corpse back to her place, making love to it on a regular basis and lavishing all of her attentions on it.  Unil one day she meets a guy named Mark, a reclusive type who earns his life dubbing adult films.  As their romance blossoms, Monika's anguish over her having to choose between her two lovers escalates.  Monika's torment and final ""decision"" leads to one of the most shocking climaxes ever put on film, a scene of bodily violation so intense that I found it even more shocking than the one in ""Cuting Moments"" and perhaps even Nacho Cerda's ""Aftermath"".
Nekromantik 2 has much of the same art-house feel that the first one does but on a noticeably higher budget.  Many scenes of necromancy are played in a slow-motion dream-like haze with a beautiful piano score in the background.  This technique works quite well in decreasing viewer disgust, almost convincing the viewer that loving the dead can be...well, beautiful.  Sometimes, however, I found the artistic touches to be a little too forceful.  In one scene, the camera zooms in on a snail as we watch it inch by inch crawling across a tombstone in the graveyard.  The scene is well done but one has to wonder what the point of it really is.  Most pretentious of all is the inclusion of a short and utterly strange black and white film about two people discussing the evolution of birds.  While watching this drawn-out scene, I could practically imagine Buttgereit frantically yelling in his director's chair ""ART! ART!"".
There was something strangely appealing about watching Rob, the jilted suicidal wanker of the first film, finally finding true love as a corpse.  I also liked the character of Mark.  Although the guy earns his living dubbing adult films, he might be the only Buttgereitt character ever to not come across as a degenerate sicko but instead is a warm, caring soul who believes in true love. Even through some of the glitches, I couldn't help but feel that I was witnessing the work of a truly gifted artist. The problem with the Nekromantik films though is that they're such sick cinematic puppies that lavishing too high praise could be misinterpreted by others as tantamount to endorsing necromancy, cat-bashing, rabbit-skinning and seal clubbing.  Although I believe Buttgereitt went a little too far by including real-life seal autopsy footage in the film, I still admire his unwillingness to tone down his style in the face of the huge protest his films have garnered in his country.
The second disc is packed with extra features such as theatrical trailers for all of Butgereitt's films, interviews with cast and crew, the amazing musical scores to both Nekromantik films and  25-minutes of behind-the-scenes footage where Buttgereitt and crew explain in fascinating detail how they created the corpse and managed to make it look so authentic.",1072915200,,4084,4.915574963609898

Sick scenes of corpes bonking follows but one night she meets a young porno film dubber who is goofy looking and she falls in love, but all this romance leads to a shocking climax. the film is well made but it is ruined by us being subject to real life footage of dead seals being cut open, the cover is nice and we also get a nice CD with it too.",1064016000,,560,3.9646017699115044

This sequel contains very little of the imagery of disgust that was at the forefront of the first film, choosing instead to focus on the blossoming love story of a female necrophile, her living lover, and the torment experienced over the fact that she is more attracted to a corpse. That said, ""Nekromantik 2"" is still a prime example of decadent German cinema and the peculiar workings of director Jorg Buttgereit. It contains all the nuances of his other work although scenes seem to go on too long, indicating that some tightened editing was in order. This is even more evident in the excellent audio commentary track where the director and others mention the editing issues. The DVD presentation is superb and contains the usual trailers, biographies and interesting behind the scenes footage. This version also contains a ""bonus"" CD of the soundtrack for both films. In all, I would recommend ""Nekromantik 2"" to fans of the first film, those who are really into German cinema, and to those looking for truly depraved video.

8314586,4,B000RQ4T4K,"Picking up immediately after the first movie, Nekromantik 2 introduces us to Monika, a nurse with a penchant for the perverse. She digs up the grave of Rob, the protagonist from the first film. She takes him home and does a variety of things with him (if you know what I mean). At the same time, she becomes romantically involved with a man named Mark, which throws a wrench in her sickening love triangle. Mark becomes wise to her interesting quirks as his relationship advances with her, culminating in an ending that is only rivaled in its bizzare nature by the first film. Overall, Nekro 2 is a solid sequel. It's more flushed out than the first film in regards to plot and character, running at nearly 100 minutes (first film was a little over an hour). The effects are on point with the first movie as well. I wasn't too big on some of the scenes in the film showing the lovey-dovey stuff between Mark and Monika like when they were at the carnival, but I can overlook that, as this is definitely mandatory viewing if you were intrigued by the first film.",1507075200,,1061,4.474226804123711

The cover art is better then the film and some of the special features are actually pretty good. The two stars are for the special features, the film is garbage and was intentionally made to be garbage.",1480032000,,343,4.292307692307692
