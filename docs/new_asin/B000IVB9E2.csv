8147581,5,B000IVB9E2,"My children attended Gymboree play classes for 3 years while they were young. We originally purchased this years ago to continue the play program at home.  Now that we have a baby niece in the family, we have just purchased another copy. The downside is that it only comes in a VHS format. It was originally filmed in the 80's; however, all the activities are perfect for a toddler...no matter what the year! The songs are interactive.  You'll find your toddler/pre-schooler quickly getting up to play along with the children on tv. LOVE IT!!",1365206400,,542,4.75531914893617
8147582,4,B000IVB9E2,"My aunt bought this for my now teenager when he was little (because my cousins were addicted to it), and it was passed down to my other 2 kids who were also addicted to it.  I don't know what t is about this video, that the kids go so crazy for it, but clearly Gymboree knew what they were doing. The VHS tape finally pooped out with the 3rd kid and I had to buy another used copy.  Thank God for amazon and used stuff for sale.  Also, my teenager groaned when it came in the mail for our 3 year old, lol!  He's like, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!  It's baaaaaacccckkk!""  So at some point, the novelty wears off :)

At any rate, I gave it 4 stars because it's from the 80's and the clothing is ridiculous and annoying, but what do you expect?
No, actually, I gave it 4 stars, because the seller said the tape was in excellent condition, but it actually has quite a few spots where you can tell the tape is beginning to wear a bit.  We'll just hope it makes it long enough for my preschooler to get sick of it.",1360972800,,999,4.087179487179487
8147583,5,B000IVB9E2,"This is a jewel of a 52 minute children's song and activity video. I enjoy it just as much as my grandson, who is about to turn 2. He's just beginning to physically engage and sing the songs; still, they've become a sweet part of his experience. It surpasses current toddler gymnastic classes in respecting a child's sense of wonder and engaging his or her imagination. Unlike the reviewer's VHS tape that lasted 10 years, ours stopped working overnight after a few months. The price has since risen from $3 to $10, but it's still worth buying another one. I hope Gymboree makes it available in a more archive-friendly format.",1288310400,,626,4.7
8147584,5,B000IVB9E2,"My one year old nephew just adores this video. The interactive songs and rhymes are such fun to do with a child. We watch this video every single morning and we do all the games and songs together. I am on Amazon now looking for another copy because this copy is starting to wear out. I highly recommend this video to all moms, aunties, babysitters, daycare workers etc.",1181260800,,370,4.455882352941177
8147585,5,B000IVB9E2,"We have had this video for 10 years, and have finally worn it out- wish they would revise it and bring out on DVD.  Highly recommend it- not for couch potatoes.",1164931200,2,160,4.161290322580645
