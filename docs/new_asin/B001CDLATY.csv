3509547,5,B001CDLATY,"This is an excellent show, no doubt about it, and I would like to own this box asap. An important question remains though: are there any subtitles on these dvd's, if not foreign than at least English or English for the HOH??

An answer to this question would be very helpfull, anyone?

3509548,5,B001CDLATY,"I had read all three books and had the Winds of War DVDs, when I finally got the W&R complete set, I'm glad I waited for it to be in a complete set, this is a wonderful history lesson of WW11 that we should never forget, the magitude is truly awesome, filmed in 10 countries, the story of the Henry family is also good, the stars did an outstanding job, these DVDs capture the flavor the the times & people, yes, it is very long, but the War was very long and covered so much of the world, in my opinion, our young people would greatly benifit from viewing  the complete series, I also thourghly enjoyed the extra DVD of the music score, & the extra features, if you are interested in this time period, you will be glad to own this magnficent set.",1231200000,,747,4.1875
3509549,5,B001CDLATY,"War and Temembrance satisfies the thirst for additional information rising from the initial encounter with a diversified and complete family, each member of which carries a type of person who had to find a way to survive from each of the situations inherited from an undersireable but impossible to avoid war.  While it is evident that ""Pug"", as head of household and jack of all trades, going much further than a high Navy officer exists and keepts the variable elements of his household in a common direction, while each can be found in all parts of the world and personally meeting presidents, dictators and prime ministers, with whom he is able to talk in their languages. It may sound impossible, but yet it anchors you to the TV screen because you want to know what comes next. Your tour of duty takes you to Germany, England, Italy, Japan and you name it.

The high diversity of environments and complexities of their functions makes you wish to see the yarn again and again because there are details you missed  which were important, but you did not realize it the first and perhaps the second time.

Definitely I advise purchasing this War and Remembrance series.  Lovers of stories related to the second world war must see this excellent sequel to the Winds of War series.",1229731200,,1282,4.7309417040358746
3509550,5,B001CDLATY,"I consider War and Remembrance to be an Outstanding mini-series and I am absolutely delighted with it.  The last disc of my set, however, was defective and I requested a replacement disc.  I was told that the entire set had to be replaced, so I sent the entire set back and received a replacement set.  The last disc of the replacement set works perfectly.  Unfortunately, I have not replayed the entire series again, so I don't know if the other discs are okay and won't know until I play the entire series over.  I will at some time in the near future replay the series, since it is such a good series, but I hope I don't have to come back to Amazon.com and report a problem with one of the other discs.  I would have much preferred it if just the defective disc could have been replaced.",1229212800,,790,4.304054054054054
3509551,4,B001CDLATY,"After 18 hours of ""Winds of War (WW),"" it's hard to be brief about the 30-hour sequel, ""War and Remembrance (W & R)."" Both works were written by Herman Wouk and directed by Dan Curtis.  Other reviewers have been so critical of the sequel, mainly with cast changes, that you find yourself  dwelling on faults.  But the fact is WW was finished in 1983; W & R was produced 5 years later.  So the two works couldn't really use the same cast.

To begin with, criticism of ""W & R"" seems out of proportion.  No, ""W & R"" is  not better than ""WW."" But we wonder what else people could have expected. Nazi brutality and glimpses of the holocaust may have been overdone, but that's how the author and the director wanted them.  Moreover, we believe fault-finding about some performers, notably Jane Seymour and Robert Mitchum is just not fair.  In our view, Jane does a marvelous job playing Natalie Jastrow Henry--probably better than Alie MacGraw had she reprised the role. (By the time of this production Alie would have been pushing 50 and 20 years too old for the part. Besides, Alie's just too feisty a person to put up with all Natalie had to endure in ""W & R."")  Regarding Mitchum, yes, he's five years older in this production but we didn't see him ""doddering"" as some reviewers say.  No, Mitchum was fine.

As to other cast changes in ""WW,"" we generally have positive views.  We see Sir John Gielgud as an improvement playing Natalie's uncle, Aaron Jastrow.  Similarly, Robert Hardy was better as Winston Churchill, despite a limited role. Hart Bochner was fine as Byron Henry, replacing Jan-Michael Vincent.  And Sharon Stone seemed properly vampish as Janice Henry, Warren Henry's widow.  We don't see the actor playing Hitler as a downgrade over the one who played him in ""WW.""  On the contrary, we found him better, as he didn't have a lisp when he spoke and otherwise played the raving maniac Dan Curtis wanted.  Actors playing Germans all did well in our view, especially Jeremy Kemp as the fictitious General von Roon.  Granted, casting Barry Morse was odd as German Field Marshall von Halder, after Morse had played a Nazi banker in ""WW.""  But Morse did well in the part, especially when he tells Hitler, ""You lost the war when you declared war on America. "" For this attack of conscience, Halder gets fired.

Finally, on the cast, Sky Dumont, who played Count Ciano in ""WW,"" returns to ""W & R.""  But this time he plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg.  We thought Dumont was fine as Stauffenberg both in bearing and performance.  What a tragedy his real-life person didn't do as well in assassinating Hitler. 10 million lives may have been spared if Hitler had died on July 20, 1944, when Stauffenberg tried to blow him up.

Action sequences involving the Battle of Midway, submarine engagements, and the naval battle at Leyte Gulf are all done well in W & R.  Missing, however, are the final surrender of the Japanese in the Pacific and in-depth drama on Stalingrad and Kursk where the Russians dealt the Germans staggering defeats.  D-Day and the Battle of the Bulge are OK, but not as profound in the movie as they really were.  Scenes of these momentous events were all overshadowed, though, by the long ordeals of Natalie and Aaron Jastrow and their fellow Jews.  They are tortured by the Nazis from place to place and finally end up at Auschwitz.  Truly, the mass murders, gassing, and incineration of innocent people has to be one of the most horrifying depictions ever put on film.

Other negatives about the production include subtitles having wrong names and information.  Example: von Roon being called, Roehm.  Also, the way some of the characters were either killed off prematurely or were never retrieved after being developed earlier.  Most outstanding of these may have been the character of Warren Henry being killed at the Battle of Midway after his heroic attack; Berel Jastrow being shot by the Nazis after his harrowing escape; and Leslie Slote being killed as a paratrooper after being trained all his life as a diplomat.  Also, as said above, too much time is devoted to the endless savagery of the Nazis.  Nevertheless, it brought to mind the quote from Hans Frank, one of the Nazis hanged at Nuremberg: ""A thousand years will pass and the guilt of the German people will still not be wiped out.""

To sum up, we found ""W & R "" a thoroughly engaging series, well worth our time and money.  Special features, moreover, add to the storyline. We give the movie four (4) stars, as contrasted to five (5) for ""Winds of War,"" mainly because of the negatives cited above. ""WW"" was a hard act to follow, but ""W & R"" did about as well as could be expected.  At times the show is hard to watch, but it makes impressions you'll never forget.",1228608000,113,4757,4.651497005988024
3509552,5,B001CDLATY,I am thoroughly happy with the purchase of Winds of War and War & Rememberance.  These are fantastic movies.  It brings you into the war and makes you part of it.  The stories were linked together so you really needed to have both of these great movies.  Buying from Amazon has been the best for me and I will continue to make purchases with them.

3509553,5,B001CDLATY,"We have always considered the mini series ""Winds of War""  and  ""War and Rememberence"" to be an example of the very best  Herman Wouk and television has to offer and patiently waited until such time as we could make them both a part of our extensive collection of VCRs and DVDs.  The work of this fine author is further enhanced by an outstanding cast of characters.  It is too bad that all of the original actors seen in Winds of War could not be continued in War and Rememberence, but considering the superb job that was done by all in both series, and understanding the complexities of assembling such a cast over a long period of time, due to other contractual obligations, etc., once you settled in to watching the films themselves, the change was not in the least disturbing.  Casting in both cases was simply excellent.",1227398400,,825,4.578231292517007
3509554,3,B001CDLATY,"This is quite a bit longer than Winds of War and it may not need to be. I skip over parts that deal with the trials and tribulations of people who, in Winds of War wandered around Europe not heeding good advice to get out while they could. Here, again, they are places where they should not be. I originally taped Winds of War and then made an edited copy I called ""The Pug Henry Story"". I have not done that with the DVD or with War and Remembrance, though I sense such an edit would be very desirable. In the meantime, get ready to fast forward or skip chapters to bring this down to a reasonable length.",1226880000,3,606,4.1440677966101696

3509557,5,B001CDLATY,ANOTHER GREAT STORY BROUGHT TO THE HOME AUDIENCE!,1509926400,,49,5.25
3509558,5,B001CDLATY,"After watching War and Remembrance for the first time, I felt compelled to go straight to Amazon to write a review.  War and Remembrance would have to be one of the largest, if not the largest, television mini-series of all time.  Grand in scale and scope, from Washington to Berlin, North Africa and the Pacific to Auschwitz, the producers held no expense spared in capturing a wide ranging, epic television event.  It's unfortunate that War and Remembrance was not a ratings bonanza when it first aired on TV back in 1988-89.  Given that the series was filmed in two distinct parts, it's easy to see where viewers would have lost the thread of the series.  And it did come in at a time at which the television mini-series genre was no longer an instant ratings success.  At the heart of the series is the 'Jew's Journey', narrated by Sir John Gielgud as it follows his descent, and that of his niece (played with an emotional wallop by Jane Seymour), into a Nazi hell.  While some critics took aim at the soap opera story wrapped around the nightmare of the Holocaust, Robert Mitcham, Polly Bergen and Victoria Tennant are at the top of their game, and only Steven Berkoff could put in a convincing portrayal of Hitler and his slide into madness.  I could go on further about this series, but all I have to say is that if you are looking for QUALITY television, this is it!  Be warned though, the Holocaust and scenes of Nazi cruelty are extremely confronting - and in today's world, should be compulsory viewing.",1506384000,,1515,4.602230483271375

3509573,3,B001CDLATY,"I've read both War books closely, twice and collected if not read almost all Herman Wouk's books, fiction and nonfiction. While I don't worship the Winds of War mini-series, I recently ordered both series because I reference the books so often to people. Opening the Winds of War boxes was like a gift, seeing the names of Ali McGraw, then witnessing the performances, the lighting and scenography, etc. I did not even notice the superb pacing.

War and Remembrance. The first episode had me wondering how, indeed the director/s expected to win people's attention with a shoddy, slippery hodge podge of a show. The first minutes give you a vulgar Sharon Stone in a kitchen, then sloppy new Byron Henry for minutes on his sub. The Village People, making a country music, no-shirts Submarine video seems where these scenes are going. Then in Italy, we meet a Natalie who looks superb but in no way has an extensive education nor a high-strung, vain and try: anything! temperament. OK for a TV show, maybe even better standard television, but as a Winds reviewer said, at Theresienstadt Natalie seems ""she is missing her afternoon spa appointment."" This goes for the Zurich minor love interest of the superb Leslie Slote, continuing from Winds of War.

It is fascinating to watch an actor flesh out Slote's role as a dispassionate, career-minded diplomat--half-in, half-out of his personal and romantic affairs, retain his honor and become in his end a small War hero. If that part is not left out from the Series, or shot too murkily with poor editing to notice.",1480377600,,1560,4.860902255639098
3509574,5,B001CDLATY,"The author Herman Wouk is one of the truly world class writers.

Following the Henry Family through the period of the Senior Naval Officer's life as US Naval attache to Germany in the pre and post war period as World War II was breaking out provides for the historical context to understand the Henry Family, World Conditions and how very fortunate Pug Henry really was.

As with any drama regarding War it is poignant, prescient, the means by which Wouk writes makes for great entertainment, as well as, historical context.

The previous book The Winds of War is the prequel movie, if you will and sets up this for a continuing theme with the Family Henry and its all too human foibles that are well characterized in terms of pride, prejudice, power, conflict and human emotions raging with the fraught perils of a Navy Life and Marital Stresses and Parental understandings for the changing morals for the times.

Highly recommended as a must have for any serious film library  studying WWII.",1479859200,,993,4.783625730994152

Together, Winds of War and War and Remembrance provide a history of the Second World War from the point of view of the Victor Henry family, a Naval Officer.

One of the sons is married to a Jewish woman (beautifully played by Jane Seymour) who is held in Italy with her Uncle. Their efforts to get back to the United States fail, and they end up in Auschwitz.  Both series were brilliantly produced by Dan Curtis.

3509622,5,B001CDLATY,"So refreshing after the bad acting by Ali McGraw and Jan Michael Vincent in the first series Winds of War. The first series was good, but sometimes painful to watch when those two ""actors"" were on the screen. The best thing director/producer Dan Curtis did was replace McGraw with the wonderful Jane Seymour. And Hart Bochner brought much more depth to his role as well. Winds of War is one of those stories that stays with you long after you finish watching it.",1442793600,,462,4.578313253012048

3509635,5,B001CDLATY,Some of the actors/actresses changed in this mini-series sequel to Winds of War but you will quickly realize why and be glad they did.  Some of the scenes will make some squeamish but it really brings home the terrible atrocities committed against the Jewish people during WWII.  I guarantee that you will be entranced with this series.  I also recommend that you watch some of the interesting special features and particularly the directors comments and the actors & actresses who talk about the movie.,1441324800,,503,4.964285714285714

3509655,1,B001CDLATY,"I'm watching this series after watching Winds of War.  The rating is based on the really, truly awful performance by Polly Bergen as Pug Henry's wife.  Her over the top emotional leakage sets new records for bad acting.  She is such an empty headed, self centered idiot that her attraction to the Peter Graves character, and the colonel (Graves' boss) is inexplicable.  Her character does not deliver a single line of intelligent thought in many hours of action.",1438992000,,462,4.884615384615385

Having several family members in the Pacific in the Navy, it pretty much brings the fight home.  For a more in depth look at the War in the Pacific, another super film if ""TORA, TORA, TORA"" !

3509733,3,B001CDLATY,As documentary WR sustains the high level of WW. The emphasis on the Holocaust was important since Germany's unqualified goal in WW 2 was to exterminate Jews and they ended the presence of Jews in Europe for evermore. Those who feel the emphasis on the Holocaust was not about WW 2 simply misunderstand that period. The personal aspect of WR was better simply because two of the three inadequate actors were absent. Seymour is a vast improvement over McGraw and Bochner is a shade better than Vincent. Unfortunately the vapid Bergen continue to play the vapid wife of Pug Henry. Mitchum continues as the  statue though his leathery face is more lined. My suggestion is that whenever you see Bergen fast forward. .,1434412800,,713,4.796747967479675

3509737,5,B001CDLATY,"Dan Curtis was a excellent producer and director . He created a Documentary that reminded the world of the horrible actions taken by the Hitler regime which no one should ever forget . The love stories and personal lives of his characters inter twined with actual events made this mini series
a outstanding piece of work . Some of the characters actors  James Michael Vincent who played Byron Henry changed because he was doing the TV series Airwolf .I don't recall why Allie McGraw was not available for the remake but Jane Seymour did a excellent job replacing her . Warren Henry's replacement I also do not know why the change was made but that is show business . The time span as others have said between the first and second series did have a slight impact but overall the re-make was just as good if not better than the first . I think Victoria Tennant is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen . To tell the story line of this drama would take away the suspense of the series . Be prepared for at least two days of cramming or a week or so of daily watching this action packed story of the ""Henry"" family until the end . War and Remembrance  series has some of the most beautiful video scenes ever made as well . Well done Mr. Curtis .",1434067200,,1245,4.316239316239316

3509755,5,B001CDLATY,"This TV mini-series is a follow-up to the previous mini-series Winds of War. I'm glad I followed the recommendation of other reviewers to buy and watch Winds of War first before watching this 10 DVD set epic sequel based on Herman Wouk's book of the same title which takes place at the start of WWII and chronologically takes you through the horrific ensuing years Naval Officer Victor ""Pug"" Henry and his family through the end of WWII. The film does an excellent job of seamlessly mixing history and events in the lives of the involved Henry family, especially the plight of Pug's daughter-in-law Jewess Natalie Henry (splendidly played by Jane Seymour) and her scholarly Polish-American Uncle Aaron Jastrow, a celebrated author and Ivy-league professor artfully portrayed by John Geilgud. Viewers will not be spared of the atrocities and horrors of Auschwitz and Hitler's final solution in the gassing and disposition of Jews. These latter final episodes are hard to watch which makes the film all the more true to its purpose to tell the story. There is a wonderful shining moment amid all of the sorrow and suffering when Arron Jastrow instructs those unfortunate Jews in the Theriesenstadt ghetto selected for transport to Aushcwitz of the way, wisdom and strength of Job amid ""senseless evil."". His point was to suffer with dignity and remain faithful to love of God - like Job. This film will also give you an appreciation of Judaism in addition to the historical perspective of WWII. Victoria Tennant reprises her role as British correspondent Pamela Tudbury adding additional elegance to this masterpiece of a film. Natalie's husband, Byron Henry, submariner naval commander is a heroic soul determined to find his wife and little son in war torn Europe.  When the rescuing American soldiers found Natalie (Jane Seymour) near dead sitting up straight, silent and erect in a stupor under a railroad car filled with concentration camp survivors and casualties, she is a pitiful picture of both suffering and survival. Jane Seymour deserved an award for her performance.",1433116800,2,2077,5.090909090909091
3509756,5,B001CDLATY,"This is a sequel to Winds of War.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has amazing scenes of the holocaust which are not for everybody but as the Director

3509788,5,B001CDLATY,"Except for Robert Mitchum and his wife in the story, Polly Bergen plus Peter Graves and Victoria Tennant, the other principal characters had to be changed. . . .which was too bad in a way.  While this disturbed the continuity to an extent, it did not destroy the story at all, but merely changed the style of acting.  In some cases this made no difference.  In others it did.  In the case of Natalie Jastrow, Ali McGraw was a most effective and intense actress.  Jane Seymour is equal to the part, but her style is more internal more of the time.  In the case of Aaron Jastrow, John Housemann and John Gielgud are close matches, even in their looks in the part.  Regarding all the other significant parts except that of FDR, General van Roon and Berel Jastrow which parts did not change actors, the level of interest and the level of acting remained extremely high.  The story, while historical fiction, is gripping in every way and chronicles a very sad but important history of the disruption created by WW II and the ambitions of Adolf Hitler.  Herman Wouk has done a masterful job in creating the drama and tension of the time.",1431561600,2,1131,4.532019704433497

No words can describe this series( which, by the way screenplay completely follows Herman Woukes book) all the characters draw you in as you see history unravel, the thing they never saw coming, the things they should of seen coming. That, and and all star cast: Robert Mitchum (who else could play pug?) JAne Seymore, Polly Bergan,and of course that hot guy, Hart Bockner, with many more actors this is a must have.  Wind of War. 1938?-1941 Pearl Harbor.  War and Rememberance 1941-45.  Warning: the last two episodes are very horrific, I think it compares to schindlers list, it is very graphic!

3509940,5,B001CDLATY,"In a word, excellent. While not forgetting it is nearly 30 years old the entire production, direction, acting, effects and technical aspects are first class. It is one of the best, if not THE best TV series I have ever watched and this ironically, multiplies the very few mistakes out of proportion and enables them to become annoying. In the case of the character AARON JASTROW played in 'THE WINDS OF WAR' by John Houseman and in 'WAR AND 'REMEMBERANCE' by John Gielgud, extremely so and this aspect came close to ruining the entire production, not to mention the viewing pleasure. This character was over done, over exposed, over used and over the top. Poor old Aaron should have been taken out halfway through the story, or his screen time divided by a factor of at least 5 . Gee! I found myself wishing some of the production crew to march on and drag him off the set. Unfortunately though, it didn't happen. Then there was Polly Bergan's character Rhoda? A woman, presumably in her 50s, carrying on like a 13 year-old, spoilt schoolgirl. What an absolute ratbag Rhoda was and a prime example of a victim of 'arrested development.' Her maturing process ceased at the aforementioned 13 years old. She should have been dragged off at the same time as the hand-ringing, annoying fool Aaron. There seemed to be a collective dearth of IQ levels among the entire main character cast and I would have been surprised if any single one made it to more than a shoe size and this is the sole fault of, primarily the director, followed closely by the screen writers. Herman would have done his share of cringing I'll bet. To sum it up: I'm kindly giving it 5 stars for the money someone spent but I've deducted 3 points because of Aaron and 1 for Rhoda so my score is 6/10. However, despite it's myriad failings it wasn't that bad. Verdict: Buy both of them, they are entertaining and for all those screen hours you won't want to turn the TV off.",1424217600,,1939,4.558739255014327

3509981,5,B001CDLATY,"In my opinion, and especially in these times, this is a must see series. I'll leave the review of the actors, correlation/comparison of the preceding Winds of War to the other reviewers as all I can add is already written by one or another and it would only be my preference, like-dislike anyway.

At 30 hours, it is a piece of work and should you purchase it, I would suggest viewing the extra/bonus disk that goes into how the production came to be and the attention to detail about the holocaust as it will add to the impact of the production.

Another reviewer said something about the possibility that the Holocaust may have been a bit over-done, and though I understand that statement, I disagree. The explanation offered on the extra/bonus disk specifically points out the location of the related shoots was on Auschwitz, the prisoner train travelling on the very tracks used during the war, passing through the same entrance, etc. Many of the extras, now middle-aged/older were  children who were prisoners at Auschwitz during the war and told how exact the reproduction was to their experience.

Though I am relatively well-read on WWII and at times, found myself being a little exasperated over the stubborn-nave nature of Aaron Jastrow; it was because I realized where they matter was going to end for him, but, of course, he did not and chose to make decisions that resulted in his being taken into custody when it could have been avoided. I think this is important as it displays just how easily the average or even affluent can choose to believe that their present existence is virtually guaranteed and will continue because it always has, when throughout time history and specifically, this period of it has demonstrated that freedom, possession and even life can be stripped from an individual or a nation over night.

What went on in these camps was for a time, dismissed as concocted propaganda simply because individuals and governments, (to include our own), simply couldn't imagine that a modern-civilized nation could contrive or carry-out such horrific acts. As WWII itself began and then expanded because leaders, chose to explain away the initial and ever mounting aggressions of the Nazis, deluding themselves into believing appeasement and compromise would eventually satisfy Hitler and avoid confrontation or war. Of course we know that this Ostrich approach resulted in a World War that made the first one look like a skirmish and the death of 10's of millions of people.

I couldn't help but to be reminded of current events and the growing anti-Semitism we hear/read about in the middle-east and even Europe. Just as the good nations and people of that time could never imagine the barbaric agenda of that regime or the magnitude of that war could ever be a reality, I cannot help but wonder if we are not just as certain that because of that example, we choose to believe that something like it can never be repeated despite current events.

They say history repeats itself, but, the only thing I can add is with modern communication, and travel, (internet, television, air travel, etc.), what took days or weeks to happen in the 30's and 40's can now happen within minutes.

Aside from the above, this series is an outstanding piece of work, both entertaining and informative and I would highly recommend it.",1422316800,5,3341,4.890459363957597

Its become a yearly tradition for me to sit in my study during the Christmas break and watch both the Winds of War and War & Remembrance in their entirety.  I can't say enough about Herman Wouk's novel and Dan Curtis's epic mini series.  Probably the most comprehensive overview of World War II ever written or filmed.

I don't know why this DVD collection claims to be ""complete"" if (1) it is missing 120 minutes and (2) the Editorial Review erroneously claims that it has ""all 14 Parts"" unless the editor was including the bonus Audio CD and the Bonus Interviews  in his math.

So, buyer beware until you get more clarification...or at the very least, Amazon.com corrects the inaccuracies in this DVD's description.",1416700800,,617,5.019607843137255
3510106,3,B001CDLATY,"First, the book War and Remembrance (WR) is equally good as the book Winds of War (WW). Reading those books for the first time recently, I mark that experience as an event in my life. Wouk has written excellent, well-researched, non-emotional, non-judgemental historical fiction. This review is a comparison of the film versions of WW and WR. First, the characters in the film version of WW are very faithful to those portrayed in the book. This rarely happens (see Lonesome Dove for another example). This is in large part because the actors understood the characters in the book and played them to the hilt. I saw WW on TV when it first came out. I never saw WR before because by 1988 I was no longer watching TV, excepting Lonesome Dove. Next, I will compare the film/book version of WW with the first DVD in WR.

First, the good news. The actors who continued are generally still very good. Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen convincingly incorporate the Pug and Rhoda Henry of the book, although Pug is supposed to be short. Ralph Bellamy plays the patrician, human, resourceful and knowledge-hungry FDR (the opposite of Hitler) so well that one thinks he is FDR. General von Roon is played extremely convincingly by Jeremy Kemp who, although not German, portrays the very essence of being a German general including his accent. Peter Graves continues as the pleasant, seductive bomb-project electrical engineer Palmer Kirby

Also continuing but less good in WR is Pamela played by Victoria Tenant. In WW she was faithful to the book: self-assured, smiling and very pleasant, a pure pleasure to watch. In WR she is suddenly a bit withdrawn and morose looking. That didn't happen in the book.  It would be very hard to beat Kurt Meissner's WW Hitler, Steven Berkoff in WR has a hard row to hoe trying to follow him. John Houseman played Aron Jastrow, the naive, arrogant academic  in WW. Sir John Gielgud is close enough in speech and character that he's also convincing, if not as. David Dukes continues as the frightened and unlucky-in-love consular official Leslie Slote. And Robert Morley's Alastair Tudsburyi n WR is a bit less convincing than the same character played by Michael Logan in WW. Winston Churchill is played very convincingly and movingly by Howard Lang in WW. Robert Hardy's  Churchill in WR is somewhat less convincing. Roy Poole's Harry Hopkins in WW was also very true to Hopkins' character as portrayed in Wouk's book.
Now for the worst infelecities.

Compared with WW, WR (filmed 5 yrs. after WW) suffers from changes in certain actors and actresses. Ali McGraw in WW portrayed Natalie Jastrow faithful to the book as a self-confident, forward, adventurous, reckless Jewish academic. In WR she's replaced by the lovely and hesitant Jane Seymour, a disaster. Equally if not even more unsatisfying, Hart Bochner is a wall-flower in the film compared with Jan-Michel Vincent's portrayal of Natalie's fearless suitor Briny/Bryan. Vincet was already alcoholic and in trouble in 1983 when the film was made.  He played the role unforgettably, one of the main characters. And Michael Woods' WR version of aviator Warren Henry is a shadow of WW's portrayal by Ben Murphy.

That said, we're continuing to watch the entire WR mini-series. I'm off to it right now.",1416528000,2,3279,4.927536231884058

Apart from Robert Mitcham being a bit ""wooden"" ( and I thought that first time round - I mean, seriously, how could Pamela have thought him one of the most exciting men she had ever met???), I have enjoyed it even more this time. A wonderful account of WW2 and some great archived footage. Felt I was on the submarine with Byron and Lady; in the concentrations camps with all those poor souls; on the fighter plane with Warren; anxiously awaiting the next move with Aaron and Natalie. Cried when I saw the throwing of bodies into the pits with absolutely not one ounce of feeling displayed by the German soldiers. The actors who played the German soldiers did a great job. As the viewer I believed they had no compassion at all for sending those people to gas chambers. I do wonder how those actors felt playing their roles. I could not have done it without feeling sad.

3510175,5,B001CDLATY,"This is probably the most shocking movie you will see about the Nazi extermination camps.
It could well have been a documentary on the whole theatre of war including the D Day landing at Normandy.
Robert Mitchum plays a subdued but mature role that continued from The Winds of War.
No false heroics from this former bold action star but his presence is felt.
Mitchum is but one of the stars but all the stars in the movie were so good especially those that played Natalie and Profesor Aaron Jastrow.
Above all the enactment of Hitler was nothing short of incredible.
I saw this movie a few months ago and am writing from the top of my head having forgotten some of the actors names but certainly not their performances.
The movie has many shocking moments especially in the death camps but they do not appear to be put in just for the sake of shock but of reality.
Many would like to close their eyes to forget the Nazi atrocities but we should not and cannot forget.
As one of Mitchum's last movies he went out on a high and classy note.
A gripping movie that you will go from disc to disc to see what eventuates.
The movie cuts across such a wide sector of WW2 that it could well go down in history as history.
Total drama and suspense..!!

It seems that the producers were willingly drawing out the episodes to fill television time slots.
New actors, though necessary, confuse the viewer until he gets used to them and forgets the faces of characters he is familiar with from the original series.

3510314,5,B001CDLATY,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies we have ever seen . A great mixture of Truth , Facts and Actual films documenting the the start of World War #2 from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii through the Pacific to the invasion of Nazi Germany through Europe to the brutality of the Jewish population throughout all of Europe. You hear of the Holocaust , the systematic mass slaughter of European Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World war #2 but hearing and seeing are two different things . They show how they transported the families in box cars on trains to the various concentration camps , forced them to walk miles to the camp , took all their valuables then forced them to remove their clothes in one building then to all walk naked to another building to be deloused but it was the gas chamber . They then would have workers remove the bodies and dump them in a ditch and cover them with lime and
dirt . They chose young ones for the labor work . Many of the scenes are actual movies taken by the Nazis of these
events . The story line features ""  Robert Mitchum "" as a Navy Officer his wife ""  Polly Bergen "" and his family of two sons and two daughters stationed at Pearl Harbor . One son is a Navy Carrier pilot and the other is a Navy submarine officer who is married to a Jewish girl "" Jane Seymore ""and they have a small son. She went to Europe
with her son to visit her Uncle who was a well known writer before the war started . When World war #2 started , she
was trapped in Italy  and couldn't leave and ended up eventually in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp . The story is about her , her son and uncle's struggle to survive and her family trying to save them . ------------This Mini Series is
Unforgettable and I recommend that everyone should watch it , especially our young people for them to see what the world was like and be proud of our Country and our Allies who defeated these Mad Men ----Jane Seymore and
Sir John Gielgud "" The Uncle "" both had Academy Award performances along with an All Star cast of Actors .

I complained to Amazon but have received no response.",1403913600,2,186,4.84375
3510318,5,B001CDLATY,"Wonderfully cast and well acted, not to mention a screen play well-written!  Sir John Gielgud is an improvement over John Houseman in the maddingly stubborn Aaron Jastrow role, and Jane Seymour is excellent as Natalie. It's difficult to envision how producer-director Dan Curtis' film could have been improved, it having been closely based on Herman Wouk's superbly researched and written book.",1403740800,,394,5.459016393442623
3510319,5,B001CDLATY,A historically accurate series about WWII that extends the Winds of War series.  This is a classic series,1403740800,,105,4.833333333333333
3510320,5,B001CDLATY,A great DVD and a great story.  highly recommended--especially good for those whose knowledge of WW2 is lacking.  Buy it now.,1403568000,,125,4.904761904761905
3510321,5,B001CDLATY,This series should be shown in high schools. The cost of freedom is no longer taught in our schools. Todays young people have no idea about the great cost of world war 2,1403222400,,169,4.151515151515151
3510322,5,B001CDLATY,The 2 Epic Mini-Series based on the Herman Wouk books are just as good as the books. Really goes into things other WWII movies just breezed through. You understand more about how ruthless Hitler was and his SS People.,1403222400,,217,4.589743589743589
3510333,5,B001CDLATY,"This series, including its prologue, ""The Winds of War"" is outstanding. It is historically accurate, believable, and the naval action scenes are as good as can be found anywhere. The carrier conflict and submarine warfare were riveting.
  It's a good family story, woven against well staged and realistic backgrounds.
The horrors of the holocaust are almost painful to watch, so much so that a little less of this aspect may have been better; but it DID happen...
The naval career of Pug Henry was a bit serendipitous , but it made for a good story and an interesting characterization of FDR.
We were riveted to our TV set during this well-made series, and would highly recommend it to anyone with even a casual interest in the background and history of WWll.",1403136000,,759,4.786259541984733

3510337,5,B001CDLATY,This series is so fantastic. It has stayed with me weeks after I watched it. I recommend watching the winds of war first though so it connects with the story all the way through.,1402012800,,178,4.264705882352941
3510338,5,B001CDLATY,This collection is outstanding in every way.  It is well done and moving.  The casting is superb.  The story is one that everyone should see.  Excellent and moving; heartbreaking and breath taking.  Do not miss the opportunity to own this recorded moment in history and share with your family.,1402012800,,293,4.8979591836734695

3510340,4,B001CDLATY,"My husband and I listened to the audio books of ""Winds of War""  and  ""War and Remembrance"" at the recommendation of my brother.  We are really glad that we did.  We each had an idea of what we thought each character looked like, and we really wanted to see who Hollywood casted into each part.  We enjoyed the movie, but not as much as ""Winds of War"".  The real star of this movie was Jane Seymour.  She was incredible in her part as Natalie. Usually I am not a big fan of war movies, but this one was so good that we could not miss a night until we were through all of the episodes.",1401408000,,583,4.017391304347826
3510341,4,B001CDLATY,The story centers too much on Natalie and Aron Jestrow. Pugh Henry and the rest of that family becomes almost just a byline story.,1401408000,,130,4.458333333333333
3510342,5,B001CDLATY,"Everyone but everyone should see this epic - realistic, honest, pulls no punches at all  re the holocaust.. Brilliantly done. it  really makes one realise what sacrifices were made to overcome the evil in the world at that time  so that we can live without fear.  How the Writer and Producer have managed to do this and yet still keep a gripping personal family story going through it amazes me.

This follows on from the Winds of War and I if  hadn't seen that first I would have found the War and Remembrance hard to get into because of the various characters and all the story lines which started in the Winds of War and were continued to completion in War and Remembrance.

3510356,5,B001CDLATY,Love love love this showed true clips of WW2 and also showed how one family delt with the hardships of war. My granddaughts will love to watch this later in life,1398729600,,161,4.225806451612903
3510357,5,B001CDLATY,"This is story is a must for anyone attempting to understand how WWII started and how close the Western Allies almost lost the war. It clearly demonstrates how any country can be fooled into accepting directions that are contrary to their deep rooted beliefs. If you want to truly understand how Adolph Hitler and his henchmen were able to create and develop atrocious and unsavory projects that everyone appeared to accept. Fear was the motivating factor. The show continues with the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor, the United States of America joining the Ally Forces and final culmination of the demise of Hitler and the total surrender of Japan. I was eleven years of age when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and my family resided in the Canal Zone (Panama) and we expected the Japanese to land on the beaches where my family resided. Quite a vivid story. Highly recommend the video.",1398124800,2,888,4.887417218543046

3510359,5,B001CDLATY,Based on some truth this is a very well put together series about the start of world war two . It has a great cast and is well made setting the scene of a follow on series.,1397260800,,172,3.675675675675676
3510360,5,B001CDLATY,"Notice no bad reviews? Wow how I felt for Natalie and her Uncle.  This second series is very predicable. I don't care as it is so well done. Also a technical note: I understand that only certain battleships were available for them to film this movie so I had no problem with minor historical flaws. FDR went to England onboard the USS Iowa during the war (not the USS New Jersey). The Iowa is now a museum ship in San Pedro Harbor, LA. Just to get things in order, there are 4 IOWA class battleships: #61 IOWA, #62 New Jersey, #63 Missouri and #64 Wisconsin.",1397174400,,558,4.314285714285714
3510361,5,B001CDLATY,"I can't remember when I have been this impressed with a series (and I'm including Winds of War in that statement).  Granted, the Nazi atrocities in Remembrance were very hard to watch, so I had to fast forward through much of that -  still watched it, but at least I got through it sooner.  As much as I enjoyed Jan-Michael and Ali in Winds of War, I think Hart Bochner and Jane Seymour were even better in War and Remembrance.  Everything about this series screams excellence to me;  I can't begin to say everything I'm thinking and feeling after finishing it up last night, but I think most of it has been covered by others anyway.  If you are interested in WWII and have never seen it before (or even if you have), this is definitely  must-see tv.  Someone commented about the ""soap opera"" aspects of it, but I didn't see any of that.  I saw realistic, solid drama that is riveting and addicting.  I can't speak highly enough of all involved with writing, shooting, acting and directing this series.  I look forward to reading the books next, since I never have.",1396915200,3,1065,4.494791666666667

3510386,5,B001CDLATY,"The sequel to ""Winds of War"", Director Dan Curtis repeats perfection. Even though some of the characters changed, the story did not suffer. This entire set should be required viewing for any person attempting to graduate from high school...with a paper due at the end. Simply fantastic photography...sadly, many members of the cast are no longer with us.",1395705600,,354,5.120689655172414
3510387,5,B001CDLATY,I had always heard how good this series really was and after watching it I know why!  Excellent story. Factual to the details of WWII. Historical info was excellent and right on. Great actors. True to the time down to every little detail. A Must See.,1395619200,,250,4.434782608695652
3510388,5,B001CDLATY,"The conclusion of Herman Wouk's two novels made into mini-series, is to me the better. It opens one week after the sneak attack on the American bases on Oahu, Hawaii. December 7th, 1941 brings to mind only two words to most Americans "":Pearl Harbor"". I believe that Nazi Germany had to come first in defeating. The Pacific war, which my Father fought, as a U.S. army soldier on the island of New Guinea, was no less important, but if the two front war against the Nazis, had turned into a one front war, if Stalin had made another peace alliance with Germany, is to horrible to conceive. This very well made conclusion covers almost every part of the war. From Italy to Singapore. From Midway to Guadalcanal, and so on. It is worth the price, which Amazon offers very reasonably, and you will never regret the purchase. A drama of a Navy family, caught up in the turmoil of World War II. J.

3510389,5,B001CDLATY,"Never seen anything that collosal. There are no words to describe this serial. Some parts towards the end are very painful to watch such as in the concentration camp scenes and the the treatment dished out by the Nazis to the jews. However history cannot be changed and to recreate such reality on celluloid must have bben a ight job. I went through the 27 hours plus discs within a week. All the actors were great and Robert Mitchum was great to watch.

3510393,4,B001CDLATY,"To put my comments in context, I need to mention that I originally read the book and the first one in the series [re: Winds of War] when they were first published.  I also had the opportunity to watch the Winds of War television miniseries when it first came out, but was not able to watch the follow-on two part miniseries due to work commitments at the time.  I recently watched the Winds of War miniseries again when it became available for viewing on a service that we subscribe too.  After re-watching that series I decided I wanted to see the follow-on miniseries and purchased this version since it was not yet available for viewing.  I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to watch this version should either watch and/or read Winds of War first.  Otherwise many parts of it will be confusing in regard to the previous character developments in the first book/series.  That being said, if you read the book version of War and Remembrance first, you may be somewhat disappointed as I was in what I felt was a lack of balance in regard to the concentration on what was the obvious main theme of the video presentation.  In my opinion, many of the characters/subjects covered in the book were not as well developed in the video presentation.  The reason why was explained in one of the bonus DVDs and I understand why it was done, but I would still have preferred to have had additional time spent on the other characters that were more thoroughly covered in the book.  That is why I only rated it four out of five stars.  That being said, I would still recommend it to anyone interested in this period of history and I don't regret purchasing it",1393632000,,1659,4.5369127516778525

3510418,5,B001CDLATY,"I loved the original series and the Herman Wouk Novels so I might be biased.  The fantastic details of the setting up of the ""final solution"" shows how people can get caught up and go crazy.  Some of those sequences ran like a ""how-to"" film but brilliant in showing mans inhumanity to man.  Jane Seymour and John Gielgud carry the series well and you can see their brilliance as actors.  Gielguds biblical speech about Job and how it applied to their situation is powerful and moving.  I spent the last winter storm-stuck inside-bored to tears week watching it.  If you have children, you should consider not having them watch the concentration camp scenes until they are older.

3510422,5,B001CDLATY,"One of the aspects of this epic that deserves praise is the director's belief in accuracy and he went to great lengths to ensure that all presentations were as historically accurate as he could make them. The Auschwitz scenes were filmed there using the actual entrance railway track (which they rebuilt) and the unloading ramp.  They also re-created using the original plans the gas chamber building.  On a more positive note, the scenes of Hitler's Eagle's Nest and the Paris Opera House were filmed there.  In the Pacific war there are accurate scenes of submarine warfare.  It was aimed at a broad audience, but nothing important was compromised.",1391817600,,650,4.9907407407407405

I suppose I was 'spoilt with the quality of Winds of War. I most say Victoria Tennant and Jane Seymour 'stole the show' - their performances are first class.
Most of the movie (series) is filmed in hazy, smokey vision which is very off putting and just adds to the disappointment.
I found that all the death camp scenes/parts hard going - a very true account of what really happened apparently but so disturbing.

There is nothing like good material and good directing to give you a great movie. We also noticed there was no nudity accept to show the gas chambers also there was no garbage language.

3510483,5,B001CDLATY,"Because Herman Wouk was so involved in the production of both ""Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"", both are prefect adaptations of the books so can be watched and enjoyed without first reading the source.  (Though I highly recommend reading both books - they are outstanding.)  I guess I was the rare reviewer who was not bothered by the casting changes in W&R.  Yep, Mitchum was too old to play Victor Henry and the actor knew that very well, but his portrayal of VH and the gravitas he brought to the role made that a minor consideration.  Once you get used to watching him smooch with Victoria Tennant, it all sort of works out.  As a naval captain, he is superb.  I loved both Jane Seymour and Hart Bochner as Natalie and Byron.  I never quite bought into Ali McGraw's overacting and Jan Michael Vincent wasn't as convincing a submariner as Bochner was.  The other changes proved to be seamless for me making me quite forget John Houseman and the guy who played Churchill.  As to Hitler, the actor in W&R was a more credible likeness than the WW actor.  Complaints about the extended scenes of Nazi cruelty in the camps - that's what happened!  No film portrayal can properly convey the horror of those times and if this film helps spoiled Americans to ""never forget"", then they did a good job.  ""The Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" stand tall as two of the greatest mini-series ever done by Hollywood.  They are well-acted, compelling and historically accurate.  I recommend them to anyone who wants to know more about WWII without all the revisionist history we have to deal with today.  Read the books, watch the series or do both.

Following Winds of War, you become part of the Victor Henry clan as you follow their lives through WWII from the perspective of the US Navy. Love, loss, fear and forgiveness make this all-too-real. Fabulous all-star cast, great cinemetography, and a reminder of why we fight. P.S. Watching the aging Robert Mitchum in this starring role is simply a treat.",1386460800,2,414,4.684931506849315
3510490,5,B001CDLATY,"I'm porting over my review of Winds Of War because it says it all.  There are cast changes in this sequel that irk some but don't detract from the completion of the story in the least (in fact I found they improved it a lot).  Just wanted to be fair and warn you of that fact.  And Winds of War is around 14 hours...this behemoth sequel is 26 hours or so.

Superb story telling like you will never see again.  Dan Curtis (that's right...the Dark Shadows guy) put together the biggest mini-series of all time (topped only by it's sequel in length and span) and it was a ratings smash.  A week long mini-series experience like no other.  Headed up by Robert Mitchum in a role he was born to play and populated with some of the most distinquished film and television actors of the time (along with the requisite male and female ingenues of the day) it is a vast and sprawling story of the events leading up to World War II kept intimate and watchable by the focus on a single family that was the genius of Herman Wouk's internationally best selling novel.  This is history told with a timeline that is astonishingly accurate and clear and made palatable by it's dramatic story woven in among the historical events themselves.  It was a genius of a book and Dan Curtis saw to it that it got transferred to the screen mostly intact.  He was a much better producer storyteller than anyone has ever given him credit and this mini series and it's sequel five years later 'War and Remembrance' are his testament.  The sheer scope of the two (40 hours) is mind boggling but necessary to bring Mr. Wouk's work to fruition for a movie oriented audience.  I cannot recommend this highly enough if you want to learn the clockwork inner workings of the events that preceded and drove World War II to it's conclusion and be entertained first class all the way.  All I urge is that you buy both this and 'War and Remembrance' together and ignore the critics inevitable nitpicking of the latter and enjoy yourself immensely.",1386374400,6,2006,4.50828729281768

I also watched The Winds of War, which  was GREAT and would be a good idea if Winds of War is seen first.  There was nothing to dislike on either mini-series.  I recommend more of our younger people to watch these so they can see what the Jewish people went through at that time and be thankful we won the war.

3510554,5,B001CDLATY,"I had watched ""The Winds of War"" and considered it to be a marvellous mini series covering the years leading up to WW2. I had also read Herman Wouk's novels of the same names and loved them as both drama and history. ""War and Remembrance"" as a mini series is not available where I live and so when I saw it was available from Amazon at what I considered to be a very good price I snapped it up and thanked my lucky stars that we have an all regions, all formats DVD player. Now to get to ""War and Remembrance"", the one thing that makes this and its predecessor great for me is the presence of Robert Mitchum as Pug Henry. He is fabulous and ties the whole saga together. That said the other main players are all uniformly brilliant and although some of the characters are played by different actors in the ""Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" the action does not suffer. The production values are fantastic and the sense of time and place are extremely convincing. Two parts that particularly hit home for me were the battle of Midway and the Nazi death camps. This is rivetting and brilliant film making. I found and find this sprawling mini series to be the apex of television entertainment and although now no longer new the series is timeless and worthy of many viewings. I cannot recommend it highly enough, get it and enjoy it.",1379548800,3,1337,4.417004048582996

3510560,4,B001CDLATY,"As fine a production as Series one -- Winds of War -- both  epic works of Herman Wouk (1915 - ?) who was 98 in 2010. These books took thirteen years to research and write and the TV series were filmed over a long period too. The depictions of war, both news reel footage from the era and the reenacted historic scenes are graphic and poignant as well as educative and shocking.

The depictions of the Holocaust are disturbing and confront the viewer with the epitome of the human degradation and cruelty by the Nazi regime and the quality of political control by the allies that denied the Jewish people any early help. If Wouk wrote these epics to educate and warn humanity about the need for truth, peace and dignity between all races, then behaviour since the Holocaust proves we still have a long way to go before we are redeemed!",1377820800,,834,4.480263157894737
3510561,3,B001CDLATY,"I just finished watching both Winds of War and then War and Remembrance back to back. I have a completely different opinion of both projects with the first mini series getting better reviews than the last one.

Overall, the writing was odd. The words were like something out of a 1930 movie. The way the males in the series talked to the females. Very mechanical and so respectful and proper. The affairs of the main characters, Pug and his wife, were so sterile. Even when his wife confronted Pug's mistress (if you call her that) it was just too polite.

Also, I think the first mini series was shot just as Robert Mitchum was reaching his apex as a leading man. Then a few years later, he was older and much stiffer. All of the shots of him had him walking in standing and walking out. That isn't to take away from his presence, which he had plenty of, but to underscore that his character was supposed to be a Navy Captain in his prime. Clearly he was too old for the part and it showed.

I also didn't like all the character recasting that the second mini series did. When you watch these back to back, the characters don't make sense when you are dealing with a new face. I think originally, when the two series were separated over many years, the viewing audience was not a familiar with the old cast and more forgiving. Back to back viewings probably not so much.

I also really got sick of the thick British sayings. ""Indeed, By-Jove, Cherri o, etc. I did a little research and most of those sayings are rare, but not extinct in England. I think it is representative of the writer's impression of the English and not so much the reality of their slang.

The best performance in both series was Ralph Bellamy as FDR. He made FDR come to life and played the part with conviction. The others got too old and they just waited too long to shoot the sequel.

It is worth the viewing. I love WWII history and this provided some historical perspectives but there was far too many literally manipulations to take most of it serious. It was entertaining but could bog down if you tried to watch it back to back to back. Take a break between episodes and you will enjoy it much more.",1377561600,5,2181,4.3861386138613865

3510588,5,B001CDLATY,"If I were teaching a college or graduate course on World War II, this would be mandatory initial viewing. It encompasses the whole deal from 1939 to 1945 (a little beyond, maybe)and brings up most all of the issues. I bought this whole set (Winds & War) ten or more years ago when it was double the price, and it was a bargain then. Again, let me say there is nothing like it. One may have heard of the ""Jewish"" issues, such as loss of property, business, family, and life. One may have heard of the dislocation, brutal deaths and actual fighting of World War II, but it is difficult to really ""get it"" until you have seen it with all the emotions thereto. This set allows a person to do exactly that.

There are many things wrong with the film, but too much right to overwhelm the wrong. For example, some things were over dramatized, one feels many of the actor exchanges between Winds and War, and most of the German officer actors were much too old. Little things like that. But it deserves a special award for the filming of the ""special action"" in the camp ghetto called Auschwitz and for the dialogue of the German officers running it. In other words, video 2 of the War and Remembrance filming will never be forgotten. It reminds me of what Laurence Olivier, narrator of the World At War series said when showing the segment on the camps, ""This is grim viewing, but please watch it ... if you can ... for this happened in our time and must not be repeated.""(my paraphrase)

If one has this set, one can show it to the subsequent generations who want to know about World War II. What better way to find out the price of freedom than to see this saga by Herman Wouk? I recommend it for any serious student of World War II, or any student period. I am a real fan of classical music. Because of the kind of contents of this film, I understand why conductors like Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, George Szell, Fritz Reiner, and Arturo Toscanini got out of town. I admire them greatly. The issues of this film also spell out the reason I shy away from certain conductors who stayed in Nazi Germany, and I am glad they are mostly gone. Today I truly admire Germany and the way it has bounced back from the days of Hitler. I highly recommend this film, and I would urge serious war students to get it ASAP and take the time to watch it.

""Winds of War"" is one of those TV mini series that you can watch over and over again without them ever becoming stale.
It's based on Herman Wouk's novels. Wouk who lived in Washington, D. C. at the time started doing WW II research in the early sixties and while protest marches against Vietnam were going on outside his apartment. The first volume was published in 1971. It included the years from spring 1939 until Pearl Harbor on 12/7/41.

Dan Curtis did bring the books ""Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" to life with Herman Wouk helping with the script and with great detail to the story. The dialogue from the novels are used in the TV mini series almost identically.
The beautiful European movie locations are gorgeous!

I can highly recommend it. It will be one of the highlights of your DVD collection.

While a few key characters had a change in actors between the first series and this one, many from the original series also returned. In some cases, the replacement actors are even better than the originals. This series picks up where the last one left off right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It continues to follow the different members of the Henry family. While a lot of things are covered, most of the episodes focus on few big themes. The relationship between the patriarch, Victor Henry and his wife is an on-going storyline that gets a lot of screen time. Also, the experiences of his daughter-in-law and her son and uncle in German captivity and eventually concentration camps get a lot of exposure. Finally, a couple of episodes focus heavily on a couple of naval engagements in the Pacific, especially the battle of Midway. If you have seen The Winds of War, you really need to see the conclusion.

In fact I believe some of them were a better fit for the trials and tribulations experienced in the crucible of the greatest war in history - especially Jane Seymour's gripping portrayal of Natalie. As in Winds of War. When the final scene appeared, my wife and I sat mesmerized, as though we'd not only watch the mini-series, but had experienced much of the drama.

3510711,3,B001CDLATY,"After watching the epic ""winds of war"" by chance recently to kill the time after a major acident, I was looking forwards to watching the follow up series that was recorded a few years later, with no experience of the story the first time around of airing simply because of my young age and no experience the written text, I could only hope for something simalar with its conclusion to the amazing work that portrays the later part of world war 2.

Trying to portray the events of this time period would never be easy, and whilst the acting by the main stars give a feeling of depth and emotion to the characters that they portray, (which is sadly missing from a number of latter drama series.) your still left with mixed emotions, with an overwhelming feeling that something is missing from this later work, there is a noticeable change of pace for the worst, and a number of changes in the cast due to unavalibility for a number of reasons whether it be personal, medical, or cast changes, has a noticable affect on the story and at times the support cast are quite frankly lacking, overall doesn't seem to engage in quite the same way and capture the imagination, of the series that came before.

This capitalised by the brushing over of major events of ww2 and lingering to long on some others,  your left with a hollow feeling that it could have been done a little bit better, this capitalized by the simply unforgivable rushed period of  the devistating events on Japan which gave rise to the atomic age in war, and some other events that are not fully explained, you wonder if there were budget issues or board room arguments about time overruns for being to long.

This is still a worthy tv movie to watch, but the question your ask is whether you'll watch all the parts again, or just view the parts that truly matter to speed events up, this sadly means this will be one of the disks collections that won't get viewing regularly",1363910400,11,1937,4.522857142857143

War and Remembrance was a Paramount Studios production and is therefore loaded with more polish and panache, while War and Remembrance was an ABC novel for television, and more limited in resources and production values.  My only complaint about  War and Remembrance is the whiney theme that kept coursing through whenever Aaron Jastrow was writing in his journal.

3510854,5,B001CDLATY,anyone interested in the history of ww 2 would really enjoy this series. Herman Wouk is a very good writer and it helps you to understand what the war was about. I think the younger generation should see this series so they know what their fathers and grand fathers went through. Their mother and grandmothers also. Hitler was a madman and japan would fight to the last person even though they had lost the war with the loss of saipan.

In Winds of War, I thought the war/military scenes were well done, but I disliked the soap opera scenes (which amounted to 33% to 50% of each episode).

I thought I'd give War and Remembrance a chance, and I was expecting it to be similar in style to Winds of War.  Most of the main characters have changed in War and Remembrance, and that was disappointing (except for Ali MacGraw--I was glad to see her gone).  I couldn't adjust to some of the new faces; they just didn't fit as well as the original folks.

After watching the first DVD, it seemed to me that 50% or more was soap opera scenes, so I did a lot of fast forwarding.  I wasn't as impressed with the war/military scenes.  I decided not to watch the rest of the series.  The soap opera stuff just isn't worth sitting through, and I don't want to spend a lot of time fast-forwarding.  There are better World War II movies out there.

3510859,3,B001CDLATY,"I saw the Winds of War back in the 80's and wondered how the story ended, so I bought this set. It was disappointing in somehow it went from a story of WW2 to mainly the story of the holocaust with a little about the rest of the war. Other than Midway the big battles get little attention and the end of the war with Japan is pretty much left out. The acting is not particularly good with a number of characters in particular too, and some of the story line is hard to believe. The characters somehow leave their posts in the middle of war and do whatever they want. Anyway it tells what happened in the storyline and does go into alot of detail about the horrors experienced by the Jews from the Nazis. Just don't expect a whole lot about the rest of the war and it also glosses over how evil and ruthless Stalin was and how the Polish uprising in Warsaw was allowed to be crushed while the Soviet armies stood by not far away.",1342396800,2,928,4.161111111111111
3510860,4,B001CDLATY,"Although amazon does not list ""War and Remembrance"" as closed caption--IT IS!

This 13 disc set chronologically follows the mini-series ""The Winds of War"", from Pearl Harbor to the end of the war. Some actors were replaced for whatever reason, and that takes getting used to. Both series are a bit on the soap opera side; more so with ""War and Remembrance"".

""Winds of War"" seemed more dramatic. Possibly, because the plot and story settings were unfolding before the viewer. Additional personages are introduced in ""Remembrance"", such as, Admiral Spruance (known for his leadership in the Battle of Midway), President Truman, and General Eisenhower (commander of the European theater of operations; not too much on General MacArthur.

Battle scenes included actual footage, but the main event was the treatment of Jews. The  story follows Dr. Jastrow and niece Natalie (now Jane Seymour) as they are moved along the corridors of detention to the final destination at Auschwitz.

This series is worthwhile having in any DVD library, to view over and over again.",1341792000,2,1061,5.145348837209302
3510870,5,B001CDLATY,"I had watched the mini series twice before and read the book, as well. I finally finished watching it again, seeing it in wide screen on DVD for the first time, thanks to this great set.

The mini series is a faithful replication of the book. The story of WWII is told from the point of view of the Henry family, whose patriarch and 2 sons are in the Navy. The characters, like people in real life, depict the emotional range you might expect to find during tumultuous times. The battle scenes are tense & exciting for the most part. But no words can describe the emotional intensity of the holocaust scenes, so realistic in their depiction of the horrors which took place. The location filming, along with actual historical film footage, certainly add to the realism.

There are lots of extras with this set. My favorite is ""Director Dan Curtis' Commentary of Key Scenes,"" which gives some insight into the technical challenges of making the series.

My only complaint, which is minor, and has no bearing on the mini series itself, is that the packaging could be better. The 6 plastic plates, which hold 12 of the 13 discs, are held together with tape, which is fine. But they are then attached to the back plate of the package with a narrow strip of tape which doesn't hold when you have to open the package to get out the discs from the back third of the package. I think they could've done a better job of that.

I recommend this mini series to anyone wanting a glimpse of what life was like during the early to mid 1940s, during one of the darkest chapters in the history of our world.",1339804800,2,1590,4.453608247422681

I bought this from Amazon, through an independent dealer, and it was half the cost of the Amazon one. The only negative with doing it that way was I had to pay postage (couldn't get Free shipping), and it took about 1 week extra to get to us - neither of which made much difference to us.

3510878,5,B001CDLATY,"""War and Remembrance"" is the sequel to the mini-series, ""The Winds of War"".  Both mini-series were based on the novels of the same name by Herman Wouk.  ""War and Remembrance"" follows the stories of the extended Henry family.  Robert Mitchum stars as Pug Henry in both programs, but he was 71 years old when he made ""War and Remembrance"" and was too old to be believable as a Navy Captain.  However, the producers and director wanted to keep him in the series, not only because he is a fine actor, but also because he was from that WWII generation and brought gravitas to the role and to the series.  Ali Macgraw from ""The Winds of War"" was replaced in the role as Brian Henry's wife by Jane Seymour in ""War and Remembrance"". A fortuitous replacement.  The role of Brian Henry is played by Hart Bochner, who replaced Jan Michel Vincent.  Both Seymour and Bochner bring much finer acting skills to the screen than the two previous actors.  The viewer will need to have watched ""The Winds of War"" before viewing ""War and Remembrance"", or the roles of the characters will be hard to follow.  One of the recurring characters played by David Dukes in both series is shown to be a coward in ""The Winds of War"", but becomes very heroic in ""War and Remembrance"".  Without having seen the former, his growth and depth of character would be overlooked.  The story is involved, but the viewer will be able to follow it, especially having seen the earlier series.  The costumes, scenery and overall visual appeal of the mini-series is stunning, especially when compared to the earlier series.  ABC spent $130 million in 1988 on ""War and  Remembrance"" and it shows in the production quality of the mini-series.  These DVD's include bonus features that show the making of the series and visits with some of the cast members.",1324425600,111,1809,4.662460567823344

I read both of the books by Herman Wouk several years ago, (Winds of War and War and Remembrance) and enjoyed them immensely.  It was refreshing to see the mini series follow the books so closely.
The casting was excellent, and I can't say enough about John Gielgud and his portrayel of Aaron Jastrow.

The Bataan death march was just given a passing reference.  Also, the dropping of the atomic bomb was given an ""oh by the way"" reference.  If you blinked, you would have missed the reference to it after it had happened.  Everything else was done very well.  I liked the documentary style they used to narrate what was going on.  It gave it all an authentic look and feel.  And the scenes at Auschwitz and Thereisenstadt show that the man behind DARK SHADOWS still has a genius for horror.  Overall, very good.

3510935,5,B001CDLATY,"I first watched War And Remembrance when it first premiered on American television. I remember coming home each night and tired or not, staying up to watch each part. All of the actors are excellent and the people who portrayed historical personages (Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill) were absolutely spot-on. Early on, I became enthralled with the progress of Natalie Henry and her uncle, famous Jewish author Aaron Jastrow, played brilliantly by John Gielgud and Natalie's son, Louis, from a freighter bound for Palestine, to an Italian villa, to Theresienstadt (the Paradise Ghetto, which turns out to be anything but)and finally, the journey of Natalie and Aaron to Auschwitz. The train scenes in the cattle car in which Natalie travels and the scenes of the selections and then the fate of those sent to the left are harrowing. I remember watching that episode and not being able to stop crying. Jane Seymour is excellent as Natalie.

Also very well done are the scenes of the lot of Berel Jastrow, Aaron's brother. He ends up on some absolutely horrific ""missions"" as slave labour to clean up the mess left by the Nazis when they first started killing Jews. It is also quite harrowing. His work-mate, Sammy Mutterpearl finally snaps and commits suicide and takes some Nazis with him. Topol was top-notch as Berel.

The parts with Victor ""Pug"" Henry, played very well by Robert Mitchum were quite interesting. He goes to Moscow and interacts with several Soviet officials including Stalin himself. The war for him is not without sacrifice when he loses his younger son, Warren, at the battle of Midway. Later, he and his surviving son, Byron, take part in the epic sea battle of Leyte Gulf. In the middle of all this is his affair with Pamela Tudsbury and his eventual break-up with his wife, Rhoda.

His surviving son, Byron, goes to Europe at the end of the war and looks for his wife, Natalie, as well as his son, Louis. There is a touching scene at the end where Natalie sings Louis a lullabye she sang to him when little and Louis, obviously traumatised by what has happened to him, starts to come out of the armour he has built around himself and hesitantly starts to sing along with her.

""War and Remembrance"" is one of the better WWII miniseries I have seen and is quite true to Herman Wouk's sweeping novel of the same name. I recommend it highly.",1312329600,19,2366,4.749391727493918
3510936,3,B001CDLATY,"Of course the story is amazing and thrilling for Americans to re-live.  Unfortunately the cinematography is not anywhere near the quality offered in Winds of War.  Many episodes are almost too dark to see, and there are troubling flashes of light in several scenes.  After the joy of watching Winds of War in its totality, four times over the past five years, we found this product a technical disappointment.",1311292800,,409,4.898550724637682
3510937,4,B001CDLATY,"I have lost track of the times I have replayed this fabulous series.  It is one of the best ways I can think of to really understand the events leading up to, and during, World War II.  I would give the first part, ""The Winds of War"" an unabashed 5 stars, but I dropped this one down to four stars probably because of things the production staff couldn't help.

The re-casting of several key roles hurt the production.  I can only assume that the actors who portrayed the characters in the first part were no longer available.

Hitler, in the first part, was far scarier and more realistic, because of the understated aura of perverted evil he projected.  It was far more effective than the raving maniac of ""War and Remembrance.""

Ali McGraw was Natalie Jastrow come to life, precisely as portrayed by the author.  Feisty, stubborn, and wildly sexy, she brought Wouk's character vividly to the screen.  Her replacement, Jane Seymour, played Natalie as a victimized rag of a woman, swept along by events rather than throwing herself against them.  The spirit portrayed both in the novel and the first part of the mini-series was completely absent, and in my opinion seriously took away from the total impact.

The same must be said of Jan Michael Vincent's replacement, Hart Bochner.  He reminded me of the guy who played Tony in ""West Side Story.""  He was there, walking through the part, without projecting anything but a body filling the camera.  That just didn't fit with the portrayal of the lazy, charming, Byron Henry, whose about-faces in times of crisis were so effective.  This guy didn't seem like he would do an about-face to confront so much as a mosquito.

The substitution of John Geilgud to play Aaron Jastrow was brilliant, and one of the highlights of the second part of the mini-series.  Ralph Bellamy epitomized FDR, and the other continuing characters were excellent.  Sadly underrated as actors are the men who portrayed Rommel and Spruance...both were perfect for their roles.

Other than that...highly recommended.",1310947200,4,2038,4.872093023255814

3510948,5,B001CDLATY,"I remember picking the first part of this one up online in VHS after getting ""Winds Of War"" from a video club. I had forgotten that it wasn't the whole story until that scene in Theresienstadt when Natalie is separated from her toddler son Louis for what is allegedly health reasons, but is actually the boy being taken out of the camp by agents of a Czech partisan group. The next thing I know, I'm seeing the graphic ""to be continued"" on the screen. I had forgotten the fact that when this was first aired, parts 8 through 12 were held back until the following spring. That began a frantic search on my part for the VHS of the ""Final Chapter"" section. When this was crossed over to DVD, that separation survived.
As it is, there's a new Byron (not that Jan Michael Vincent was that awesome), a new Natalie (ditto for Ali McGraw), a new Warren, a new Aaron Jastrow (to me, the late John Houseman was a bit too ""veddy British"" for a Jewish American college professor). But Robert Mitchum was still there, in a role as meant for him as Brando's Godfather. Polly Bergen is still there, although she didn't play Rhoda as ditsy as Wouk wrote her. And Victoria Tenant is the sweet charming English girl who charms American audiences in the same tradition as Julie Andrews or Hayley Mills. You can imagine a dour middle aged naval officer like Pug who you'd never imagine fallling for a girl as young as his kids doing so anyway with her.
There's one part that calls for ""parental advisory"" between the Theresienstadt commandant and Natalie in which little Louis is also threatened, plus a grueling scene later on at Auschwitz involving Aaron. Still I hope they keep moving this film on to whatever new format they come up with. This story has been part of my library since it existed only in book form. World War II ended two years before I was born, but this story's author Herman Wouk has a way of making armchair historians out of his readers, and now his viewers.",1308441600,,1962,4.49859943977591

War and Rememberance is a much longer work, but I'm not sure that translates to better.  The mixture of the familiar characters from Winds of War along with mostly historically accurate ""real"" people is fairly well done.  The Nazis were bad.  I get it.  It seems like Wouk spends an undue amount of time giving examples of Nazi cruelty without advancing the story.  The handling of the Valkerie plot was good.

What they got right:
- involvement with the characters
- historical accuracy
- sets, costumes, and vehicles
- showing how much Europe owed to the Russians.

What they missed:
- Putting stories in both Pacific and European theaters was too much
- Plenty of German atrocities; very light on Japanese atrocities
- While Naval cryptologists get brief credit for the Battle of Midway, there is no mention of the Enigma-breaking efforts of the British at Bletchly Park and how this shortened the war.  The story spends a lot of time in the U.K., so this should have been addressed.
- D-Day is presented as pretty much going off without a hitch.  It was a train wreck.
- The main theme of the musical score is great, but much of the rest of the sound track just doesn't fit very well.  Pretty standard for TV of that era, though.

I have to admit that on War & Remembrance, I still have to close my eyes in some places.

Directed by Dan Curtis

All elements of this production are astounding: casting, acting, writing, historical accuracy, filming, locations, not to mention the haunting music. The series is aided by a brilliant, unforgettable score by Bob Cobert, especially the main theme which seems to encapsulate every single emotion of the thirty hours into its two minutes.

Robert Mitchum turns in a fabulous performance as Victor 'Pug' Henry the no nonsense patriarch of the family. Polly Bergen plays his flibbertigibbet wife Rhoda to perfection.

The heart, though, is the central plot of Jane Seymour, in a heartbreaking career-best performance as an American Jew trapped in Europe, and John Gielgud, mesmerizing as her uncle. Of course, having John Gielgud in the cast didn't hurt! He was absolutely marvelous. I can only say that the entire story concerning Gielgud and his family was remarkable.

As they are slowly, inexorably pulled into the Holocaust we follow them, step by agonizing step, to the final horrors of Auschwitz, filmed entirely on location.

The viewer is also given a glimpse into the thinking of the Nazi leadership, with Steven Berkoff providing a chilling and brilliant portrayal of Adolf Hitler.

""War and Remembrance"" is as close to time travel as possible, and makes that dark period of history come powerfully alive.

3510961,2,B001CDLATY,"A very disappointing sequel to Winds of war, for two main reasons: The script was written by two writers other than Herman Wouk, who 'co-wrote'; and the director was completely out of his depth, allowing the actors who played Hitler, Stalin, Eichmann, and several others to disintegrate into cartoon characters. The change of cast is also distracting for those who saw Winds. The film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a docudrama about WWII, the search for Nathalie and her son, or the soap opera between Rhoda and Pug. There are several more subplots as well, so the mind starts to wander rather quickly. There are far too many unnecessaery scenes of violence and graphic suffering. As a specialist in military history and uniforms, I was driven around the bend by the inaccuracies in American uniforms, insignia, and decorations.

It's a well-done series, rather long, but the holocaust episodes take up a disproportionate amount of total time; otherwise, I would have rated it a 4-star movie if this were edited better. For people somewhat unaware of the holocaust, it may not be an issue.

Lastly, Pug's wife, Rhoda, was also overdone. A person can't be as stupid as she was portrayed, so I found it hard to take her role as credible.

3510972,5,B001CDLATY,"To those who stumble upon War and Remembrance, watching this series is somewhat difficult if you haven't seen Winds of War, the first part of the story.  It too is available on DVD and I highly recommend getting it.  Otherwise there are just enough in-jokes and previous references that you'll get confused.  So if you go on, I'll assume that you've either seen or read Winds of War and will know what I'm talking about.

War and Remembrance is essentially a history lesson that's told dramatically.  The lesson, of course, is about the second part of World War II, the part that the United States was most actively involved in.  That's the strength of the series, how well it deals with the history, and of showing the viewpoints of American, Russian, and German officers, and American, British, and German politicians.  You saw all the sides in this, and the lesson was much the better for it.  Were the points a bit obvious at times?  Of course, but when you spend the kind of money they did on the series, you want to reach the broadest possible audience.

How does it compare with the book?  Quite well really, the mini-series was long enough that relatively little was left out or compressed.  There were little scenes here and there, but nothing major was on the cutting room floor.  Does it help to have read the book first?  That depends on if WWII history is your thing.  If it's not, then reading the book is a great primer, long though the book is.  But if you're contemplating a 25 hour mini-series, something tells me that length is not an issue for you.

The casting is always the key to any mini-series or long-form series (like Lost), and here it's a mixed bag.  Dan Curtis, writer/director/producer/bossman cast Winds of War's characters almost uniformly too old for their parts, and while some of them are back for this one, some were either let go or chose not to come back.  Those who are back include Robert Mitchum as Pug Henry, Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry, Victoria Tennant as Pam Tudsbury, David Dukes as Leslie Slote, and Ralph Bellamy as Franklin Roosevelt.  Bellamy to me is FDR, I can't read about him in history books without picturing Ralph's face.  Likewise Polly Bergen was PERFECT as Rhoda, the then semi-retired actress just nailed it in every scene.  Dukes was a great Leslie, the actor was taken from us far too early.  And Mitchhum?  Way too old for the part even in Winds of War, and the five year break in between did him no favors either (something he pointedly brought up to Curtis in between, telling him to hurry up with the W&R script).  His romance with the much younger Tennant was a bit off putting as well, solid though she was.  But Mitchum had a gravitas and depth that was badly needed for the role, and for that I can't bring myself to criticize him.  His acting was certainly top notch, as always.

The newcomers?  Jane Seymour replaces Ali MacGraw as Natalie Jastrow Henry, and while the acting is better, it's the age that  really matters.  MacGraw was 15 years older than the part and it really showed, though the character is the most frustrating of the books/series, behaving stupidly at almost every turn.  Hart Bochner replaces Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron Henry, and the age is better, but Bochner isn't the Byron of the books, and is such a long way off that it's like they wrote the character to fit the actor, rather than hire an actor to fit a character.  Vincent was a mess by this point, but I would have liked to have seen his take on things.  John Gielgud replaces John Houseman (who was very sick when production began, and would soon pass away), and he fit Aaron Jastrow a little better for the Paradise Ghetto parts.  I just couldn't see Houseman more or less becoming a rabbi, talented an actor though he was.  Most of the minor parts were re-cast, including an amusing switch by where Barry Morse, who played the German banker Wolf Stoller in WoW, played German General Halder here.  All in all the acting was an improvement, for the most part.

The extras?  Well they're not bad, considering.  They have a series of retrospective docs, with interviews with most of the surviving actors (Mitchum, Dukes, and Gielgud are among the actors who had passed on by this point), and a lot of Dan Curtis (who too has died since).  Curtis does not lack for confidence, as the interviews will show, and it's totally necessary when you're shepherding a pair of nine figure mini-series to the screen, when $100 million meant a lot more in a budget than it does now.  They cover as much as can be covered really, and take the place of an almost impossible to do commentary track, much as I would have liked to have listened to one.  The video and audio quality are about what you would expect from a 20 year old series, and since I doubt they'll go the Blu-Ray route with either series, this is the best we're going to get.

The price?  Awesome, for how much you get.  I'd been waiting for the makers of the series to get reasonable with their pricing (they topped out at over $140 at one point), and now it's a great deal, especially for how long the mini-series is.

The myth is that W&R killed off the long form mini-series, as the ratings were only so-so for how much money was spent.  Instead, I think that the genre has transferred to regular serielized TV dramas like Lost and Heroes.  One long story, told over many hours, with a large cast.  Not much difference really, if you think about it.

My family bought this for me for my birthday.  Great story, although the pacing needed to be worked on a bit as some episodes are all romantic soap opera and the next episode will be full of action and war drama.

I gave the Remembrance a four star rating mostly for content.  The video quality is questionable and the audio is a mixed bag.  On a big screen TV like I have the video is fuzzy and the colors very muted.  Looks like it was taken from a VHS master and not redone for DVD.  The audio is the most interesting thing to me.  The first set is in stereo and I can run it through my surround processor and the voices are in the middle track and the music and audio effects are in the two front channels.  On the second set of discs, called the Final Chapter, if I run it through the surround processor, everything comes out of the center speaker.  Just seems like they didn't process the audio the same on the different sets.

Herman Wouk is such a great author... what is the matter with us for the current neglect? That in itself is reason to polish this series up. I remember in my childhood that the Bogart character in Caine Mutiny was the subject of years of comedy exploitation... fitting right in to the Wouk message that the crew of the Caine was sadly... wrong, in their failure to try to help their captain.

3510999,5,B001CDLATY,"""The beginning of the end of war lies in remembrance- Herman Wouk""

I loved this series when I was a teenager and remember watching this epic mini-series with my family. It has been years and I was happy to discover that the entire War and Remembrance was available in a complete DVD boxed set at an affordable price.  This latest boxed set comes attractively packaged and comprises:
Parts I- VII (6 discs - 13  hours, Rating: NR) with bonus materials including a documentary, ""The Making of War and Remembrance"" featuring interviews with the actors, Herman Wouk (the author upon whose work this mini-series was based), and production personnel including director Dan Curtis, the featurette ""War and Remembrance - A Living History"" hosted by Robert Mitchum. There is an insert with summaries of Parts I-VII, an introductory message from Herman Wouk, and a message from director Dan Curtis.
Parts VIII-XII (5 discs ) with bonus materials including ""War and Remembrance - Behind the Scenes"" (a documentary focusing on the Holocaust segments and including new interviews with Jane Seymour, Hart Bochner, and Victoria Tennant), director Dan Curtis' commentary of key scenes, TV promos, and a CD of the original television soundtrack music composed and conducted by Bob Cobert- the soundtrack was the longest motion picture score of all time. The insert here includes a message from Jane Seymour, Hart Bochner, episode summaries, and a production overview.

For those new to this series, I would advise watching the prequel ""Winds of War"" which is also available on DVD.  ""War and Remembrance"" begins about a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and once again viewers get to see the various members of the Henry family. Victor ""Pug"" Henry (Robert Mitchum) assumes command of the U.S.S. Northampton, whilst his eldest son Warren (Michael Woods) is a fighter pilot on board the U.S.S. Enterprise. Byron (Hart Bochner), Pug's other son is a torpedo officer on a submarine. Byron misses his Jewish-American wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour) who together with their infant son and famous uncle Dr. Aaron Jastrow (Sir John Gielgud) are trying to evade the deadly Nazi web, though events will soon enough conspire against them.  Meanwhile, Berel (Chaim Topol), Aaron's cousin is a Soviet POW who ends up in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In Parts VIII-XII, we see the conclusion of this epic mini-series as the lives of the Henrys and the Jastrows play out against the backdrop of the war. The implementation of the Final Solution sees the destruction of European Jewry made all the more harrowing through the credible portrayal of Natalie, her young son and uncle Aaron and their collective suffering. The depiction of the Final Solution - mass shootings, gassings, etc is one of the most realistic and horrifying depictions of the Holocaust ever portrayed on screen (the other shows that come close are Holocaust, Amen, and Schindler's List, amongst others). The depictions of Nazi brutality are quite gruesome and I would advise caution against showing this to children under 12. Viewers get to see the leaders of both sides (the Allies and the Axis powers) - FDR, Churchill, Hitler, etc. make historic choices , and the eventual conclusion of the war.

This is an epic mini-series that is memorable and will forever remain a classic of its genre. Highly recommended and a must-watch for history buffs and those interested in WW II history and Holocaust history.",1263600000,3,3463,5.086267605633803

3511001,5,B001CDLATY,"""War and Remembrance""(the complete epic) is powerful movie-making with a profound message for modern generations. Set amidst the loves and lives of the fictional Henry family, this story places you right in the middle of World War II and all of its brutality. There were significant casting changes from the original cast of ""Winds of War"", which take some getting used to - the abscence of Jan Michael Vincent and Ali McGraw in particular. However, the cast is ultimately overshadowed by the enormity of the historical events, especially the Holocaust, which Producer/Director Dan Curtis shows with unflinching realism. Using a mix of archival footage and very realistic dramatic scenes, he shows us the horror of the Holocaust juxtaposed with the seemingly normal day to day life of the German soldiers who were ""just following orders"". Everyone alive now, and particularly those under age 40, need to understand the  magnitude of these events and why the WWII generation was indeed ""The Greatest Generation"". Today we are faced with a multitude of Holocaust deniers and people willing to use appeasement as a tool to deal with terrorists - it didn't work 40 years ago, and it won't work today. Watch this mini-series with your family so that you all can understand that these things can happen, are even happening now, when good people fail to speak up or take a stand against tyranny. ""War and Remembrance"" is a gut-wrenching history lesson that the World needs to listen to, wrapped up in an engrossing dramatic story. The holocaust scenes are graphic and disturbing, but considering much of the gratuitous nudity and violence that children are exposed to today, I think children(12+)especially need to see this to understand exactly why the Nazis had to  be stopped at all costs. Be sure to watch ""Winds of War"" before you watch this one, or you will miss a lot.",1258243200,,1868,4.964856230031949

If you had not read the books, you still got a very consise understanding of one of the most pivital times in recent history. The only thing that I didn't like much was the replacement of some of the cast from The Winds of War, but their replacements managed to stay mostly true to their predecessors. All said & done, it is a very powerful story, told in a very intimate way through the lives & fortunes of the central characters.

Mitchum is no longer with us, but the rest of the cast (especially Jane Seymour and the late Sir John Gielgud), and production should be commended for the gripping and horrific reality that they gave to this movie.

3511019,4,B001CDLATY,"Given how ""The Winds of War"" had been an excellent mini-series chronciling the lead-up to Pearl Harbor, one would think the follow-up would be better with the war itself. Instead, it suffers from overly padded dialouge and plotting and an overreliance on stock footage and narration to explain the big parts of the war. There's also the fact that about 90% of the cast has been changed which naturally shakes things up.

The worst of the casting is Hitler as here we get an over the top performance rather than the more restrained actor of ""WOW."" I know that this is supposed to show how Hitler lost control as the tide turned but it still comes off too camp to be effective. Spending so much time on the plots to kill him also comes off hard as it takes away from the other storylines.

However, casting Jane Seymour as Natalie works as she's a more sympathetic figure now and John Geilgulld is excellent as Jastrow musing over his fate. Mitchum may be a bit older now but he and Polly Bergen still mix wonderfully as does Victoria Tennett to give their story heart. It also helps having David Dukes back as Leslie Stole who redeems himself from the first story by discovering Germany's plans for the Jews. Those who wonder why the Allies could not find this out earlier are answered by the statement that no one wants to believe a civilized nation could carry out such a horror.

Indeed, it's stunning how the Holocaust is depicted, with nudity of people that wouldn't get on TV today so it being shown on 1988 networks is amazing. The horrors are done from the gassing to mass graves and the horrible shot of a little girl lying amid a pile of bodies. Even worse are the Nazis treating it like a joke and going about things normally while committing mass murder.

Like ""WOW,"" Herman Wouk co-wrote the screenplay so it's quite close to the novel and improves by showing stuff that was only mentioned in letters or notes. The big change is that the Battle of Leyte, a major event in the novel spanning several chapters, is brushed off here with stock footage. That amazed me as in the novel Pug reacts to the bad decisions his commanders make and would have made compelling drama but I guess they couldn't afford it.

So while it doesn't match the scope or impact of ""WOW,"" this is still amazing for the scale of production and giving a human face to one of the greatest tragedies in our history.",1240963200,2,2397,4.513824884792626

3511024,5,B001CDLATY,"This was one of the best TV mini-series, this sequel to ""The Winds of War"". The producers had a good idea when they cast Robert Mitchem however they must have been thinking of him when he was actor in his younger days when he didn't 'act' so bored. Mitchem was miscast. He shows little emotion and in fact drifts through this series as if he were on valium. He acts as if he just doesn't wnat to be there.  (That's something Jan Michael Vincent must have been on in the ""The Winds of War""; he was terrible.) What got my attention however was the epic scope of the story and visuals, as well as Polly Bergen's performance. She's incredibly good and her characeter is truly like one of those sad and silly women of those 1940's films.  Jane Seymour and other cast members are wonderful too. The scenes in the concentration camp are powerful and will break your heart. Network television doesn't make them like this any more.  We have to depend on the likes of HBO and pay for the service.  Grand, sweeping and worth whatever you pay for it.",1235520000,3,1038,4.4188481675392675
3511025,5,B001CDLATY,"Absolutely brilliant! What more can one say about this mini-series even with the various changes in the actors playing some of the main characters? Jane Seymour took over the part of Natalie Jastrow/Henry with consummate ease, while Sir John Gielgud took over the part of Aaron Jastrow with consummate ease as well. I thought he played the part far better than John Houseman did in The Winds of War. John Houseman had a tendency to play John Houseman in most of the roles he'd played up to and including that point. The special effects were much better than they'd been in the Winds of War, the difference of 5 to 6 years that had passed by between the making of the Winds of War and War and Remembrance could be seen. Whereas I haven't gotten around to reading either of the the two novels the mini-series were based on I feel that on having watched both series they would now make me want to read both novels just to see if both mini-series differentiated very much from both novels.
I would have no hesitation in thoroughly recommending the viewing of both mini-series to your customers.",1232755200,,1090,4.5948717948717945

8287093,5,B001CDLATY,"""The Winds of War"" (""WOW"") with its sequel, ""War and Remembrance"" (""WAR"") - this review will cover both - is based on Herman Wouk's massive and engrossing two-volume historical novel set just before and during World War II. It is one of the best miniseries ever made, following the books closely and being faithful to the characters Wouk created. The history is spot-on accurate and all the fictional characters and happenings are completely in keeping with the real historical context; this is one historical miniseries that one can actually learn from while being very entertained. WWII was the most important event in the 20th century and everyone should know something about it, how it came about and what happened. The world we live in today was shaped by WWII and its aftermath.

The sheer scope of the series is staggering. It covers a period of 6 years and spans the globe. Locations are well-chosen and convincing - most of it was filmed in the Czech Republic, which does duty for many different locations. (For example, Berlin is actually Prague.) Special effects - no CIG back then - are excellent. The writing, cinematography, and the score, are all superb. In WAR, the scenes of the Final Solution, particularly in Theresienstadt and Auschwitz (filmed on location in Auschwitz), are truly harrowing and not for the faint-hearted.

Best of all is the cast (with one important exception). Appearing in both series:

Robert Mitchum brings real gravitas to the role of Pug Henry. He is older in appearance than he is supposed to be in the books but not so much so as to be problematic. He is rather dour, but then the character Wouk created is like that. Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry is perfect - she captures the character's charm, frustration, flirtatiousness and loneliness, in addition to being very beautiful to look at. Victoria Tennant is excellent as Pamela Tudsbury. (What happened to this actress?) Also fine are Peter Graves as Rhoda's love interest, Topol as Berel Jastrow, David Dukes as Leslie Slote, and Jeremy Kemp as General Armin von Roon.

Other than the above, the cast changes considerably between WOW and WAR, usually for the better:

Natalie Jastrow - This was one of two very important changes in cast. In WOW, Natalie is played by Ali McGraw, and she is the big exception to excellence I mentioned earlier. McGraw's acting is flat and artificial, and her delivery of dialogue is frequently stilted and just doesn't ring true. Also, she looks too old. Fortunately, Natalie's big moments in this series come in WAR, and here the outstanding Jane Seymour is in a different acting league from McGraw. Seymour combines vulnerability and fragility with an immense inner strength, particularly in the intense scenes in Theresienstadt. The final scene of the series, when Natalie is reunited with her son, is heartbreaking. Every one of Natalie's scenes in WAR rings true. One simply can't imagine Ali McGraw in this part in WAR.

Aaron Jastrow - John Houseman is perfectly acceptable in this part in WOW. Houseman is basically a one-note actor - the stern professor he played in ""The Paper Chase"" - but fortunately Aaron is a stern professor type, so this works OK in WOW. But in WAR Aaron is played by Sir John Gielgud, one of the great actors of the 20th century. This casting change is fortunate, because as with Natalie, Aaron's most intense and challenging scenes come in WAR, particularly in Theresienstadt. Gielgud brings a depth, a profound emotion and gravitas, to Aaron as he reverts more and more to his Jewish roots. Aaron Jastrow's final lecture, more a sermon, to the Jews in Theresienstadt is magnificent. This is one of the great portrayals in television history.

Byron Henry - played by Jan Michael Vincent in WOW and Hart Bochner in WAR. Both are very good. I would give Bochner the edge, but not by much.

Winston Churchill - both Howard Lang (WOW) and Robert Hardy (WAR) are excellent. My personal preference is for Lang.

Alastair Tudsbury - WOW's Michael Logan is good, but Robert Morley in WAR is absolutely delicious in the part. Morley's expressions, particularly his popping eyes, are frequently hilarious.

Adolf Hitler - both actors are excellent. Gunter Meisner (WOW) is very intense but also conveys an odd, shy charm at times, and a stillness, that those who encountered Hitler frequently commented on. Steven Berkoff (WAR) is more of a scenery chewer, but then at this later point in time Hitler himself was a real scenery chewer, so the over-the-top ranting is completely justified. Berkhoff lets us see Hitler's progressive mental breakdown and he has Hitler's hypnotic eyes.

All the other actors in the two series are at least good, and most are excellent.

In sum, I cannot recommend this miniseries - both parts - highly enough. Everyone should watch it.",1517443200,8,4819,4.91389913899139
