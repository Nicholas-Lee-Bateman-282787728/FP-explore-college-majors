8369193,3,B002FL3IYC,"There is no doubt that this DVD contains loads of information. However, he does a poor job of breaking it down so that the viewer can learn it. For example, he would be in the middle of a flow drill and say if you want to switch sides you could do this, or this, and you could also do a half-hearted here and your partner could do this or that, and then continue on with the drill like the viewer would be able to catch just what happened. 3 stars for poor presentation.",1474934400,,470,4.064516129032258
