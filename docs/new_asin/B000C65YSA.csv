2453197,5,B000C65YSA,Personal Services is one of those gems that is not known well in The States. It's a hilarious play on the quirky side of modern day politicians and is not only contemporary but insightful while still managing to stay clean. Though it takes place in Great Britain it's notions can be applied to any contemporary culture. I'm surprised that this film didn't get more exposure in The States. It's really funny and a lot of fun..,1267228800,,425,4.605263157894737
2453198,4,B000C65YSA,"This film has a curio advantage going in. Apparently this was butchered by it's studio upon release then later reclaimed and restored by Perkins and director Maurice Phillips. This film has a decent cast but the plot has obviously been over used (Weekend at Bernie's anyone?). It offers a few good laughs here and there and Perkins as you've never seen her before, is simply triumphant; Sadly for her this film was overlooked and quickly gorgotten. She has never been better.",1249344000,5,475,4.8765432098765435
2453199,5,B000C65YSA,"I've been watching this video from time to time since it first came out on VHS in 1986, and its still FUNNY! Monty Python's Terry Jones takes aim at sexual immorality and blurs the line between reality and fiction with hilarious results. His characters come to life, and the viewer has the benefit of having them metamorposize out of the TV and into people we can all relate to. Some of his finest moments (outside of Python) are contained in this film. Not for those who are offended by sexual situations, or having their mores challenged. Great fun for the non-offended viewer!",1244592000,,579,4.686274509803922
2453200,5,B000C65YSA,Personal services was certainly an eye opener a real classic ;  again a brilliant Julie Walters movie.,1240358400,,102,5.0
2453201,5,B000C65YSA,Over Her Dead Body is a hilarious movie. (Nothing like the modern version.)  This is my parent's favorite comedy.  They tried looking for this on DVD and couldn't find it.  (It's not even carried by the two major mail-in DVD companies)  To have found this with another bonus comedy was a plus!  This was an excellent Father's Day gift.  Everyone is very pleased.  Thanks!,1213574400,10,371,4.703125
2453202,5,B000C65YSA,"Personal Services  is simultaneously hilarious and depressing, much like The English themselves.  It succinctly illustrates the coplexity and hilarity of ""The English Vice"".  Delightfully and non-judgmentally kinky, I would describe it as a lightweight pre-cursor to ""Boogie Nights"", or perhaps the more recent indie hit ""Little Miss Sunshine"". The relationships that develop between the protagonists are what make this film really shine; by the end of the movie you realize they have become their own extended family, albeit with a rainbow spectrum of kinks, a convivial community of regular people, just trying to live a life.

Directed by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame, (which explains a LOT that the viewer should research themselves) starring Julie Christie as an English woman loosely modelled on the real life ""Cynthia Payne"", an english madam of a kinky brothel.  There are numerous quotable bits, but I won't quote them as they're funnier when you hear them fresh.

The other movie is shiny and reflective and can be hung in the trees to scare away crows.",1189641600,5,1067,5.174418604651163
2453203,5,B000C65YSA,"Personal Services:  I've seen this movie a dozen times at least, it has me giggling every time.  Not only is it good cheeky English comedy it also makes an interesting statement on narrow social norms and hypocracy.

I've bought it for several friends who raise an eyebrow in my direction after watching it but they laugh despite themselves.

Other movie isn't very good.  I'm baffled why they were put together.",1181433600,9,412,4.828571428571428

2453236,5,B000C65YSA,"Two great films at a great price.  Since Personal Services is an older foreign film, was thrilled to find it.",1384041600,,109,4.45
2453237,5,B000C65YSA,"Personal Services is a small film but very very funny and Julie Waters as always gives the part all she has which is plenty. Over Her Dead body is an okay film but again, if you missed Personal Services I would highly recommend getting this DVD. It's an unsung hero of a film.",1374278400,,276,4.226415094339623
2453238,5,B000C65YSA,we love the movie over her dead body it is funny what that poor woman goes through just makes us laugh thank you,1357776000,,112,3.9130434782608696
2453239,5,B000C65YSA,"Once again Red Carpet lists an incorrect aspect ratio info on one of their DVD cases.

The aspect ratio for Personal Services is listed as Full Screen (1.33:1) - They got THAT one right.

But the aspect ratio for Over Her Dead Body is also listed as Full Screen - That is NOT right.  Over Her Dead Body plays in Wide-Screen at 1.85:1.

It does no good to try to correct this with Amazon - I've tried.  They rely entirely on the DVD case info.  It is up to reviewers to inform other prospective buyers.

Sigh.

I bought this DVD for Over Her Dead Body, a film I had heard much about and was anxious to see.  It was a disappointing use of good talent.  If that were the only movie on this disc, I would have rated it only 2 Stars.

My 5 Star rating is for the surpisingly funny Personal Services.  Directed by Terry Jones and starring Julie Walters, it is a great, gritty send-up of English moral standards - with a ""message"" reminiscent of The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas and The Ruling Class.

I have a new British comedy to add to my favorite movies.",1304812800,,1055,4.241206030150754
2453240,5,B000C65YSA,"I looked all over for this movie(Over Her Dead Body), this was the only way I could get it on DVD which is fine by me. This movie is hilarous, Elizabeth Perkins & Judge Reinhold could not be more perfect. A must see.",1297036800,,216,4.046511627906977
2453241,2,B000C65YSA,"Personal Services is brilliant, and as far as I know this is the only way to get it in the North American market.  The second feature, Over Her Dead Body, isn't worth wasting a single-word review on.  What was really disappointing about this product is the complete lack of forewarning that it is not presented in proper widescreen format.  In an age when old-style square televisions are increasingly relegated to secondary use or recycle bins, full screen DVDs have little place.  And unlabled full screen DVDs are completely unforgiveable.",1294876800,,542,5.056179775280899
2453242,4,B000C65YSA,"Over Her Dead Body is a very difficult movie to find. If you look for it on other websites, they bring up a movie with different actors that I am not interested in. This movie from the 80's was a dark comedy about a couple who were having an affair. They think that they accidently killed off the wife. The mayhem escalates from there....lots of fun.",1293408000,4,350,4.318181818181818
2453243,5,B000C65YSA,"The story line and players are great, good clean fun and not over done anyone could watch this show and have a good laugh from the young to the old. If you like some good comedy that is different than this is it, It would be one off the best comedies that has come out in a long time. I have to say thumbs up for the entire movie. A must to buy.",1274745600,,345,3.73972602739726
