8506708,1,B006Z10BBQ,"DON'T BUY THIS!  I had no idea how cheaply & crappily made this DVD would be!  I bought this for my boyfriend, thinking it would be interesting & a 2-program DVD...it's only 1 program (""In Their Own Words"") & it's terrible!  The audio interviews sound muffled &, because it's unauthorized (didn't realize this until it arrived in the mail), every film clip, interview, & photo credits the source, which is annoying since it's constantly written on the screen throughout the program.  Do NOT get this for ANYONE!  I was so embarrassed that I bought such a boring DVD that must've been made by some crappy bootlegger.  I'd give it NO STARS, if Amazon let me!",1357776000,,656,4.660869565217391
