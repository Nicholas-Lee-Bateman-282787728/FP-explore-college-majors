4075600,5,B0036BDQ88,"Naruto Shippuden Box set 2, besides arriving in more than excellent condition from a site that has never disappointed me, the set continues with the story of Naruto and the crew.  Four years later after intensive training with Jeriah Naruto pairs up with Sakura and Kakashi to continue the battle.  But this time they are helping the sand village and Gara out of a sticky situation.  The Akaski (sp) are collecting the individual demons for their sinister purpose and Gara holds the sand demon shikaku (one tail).  I won't blow the story line but the fighting is intensive, the drama wonderful, and the story line more than interesting.",1282867200,2,636,4.861111111111111

4075603,5,B0036BDQ88,"The second box set of the best anime out there contains one of the (if not THE) most intense fights in the series so far. (it's is a matter of taste of course)
The fight with the puppet master Sasori is very thrilling from beginning to end.
It's just to bad that the last episode of the fight against Sasori is missing here.
Contains episodes 14 to 26.

I've always been a fan of the english dub (maybe it's because english isn't my mothertongue and I always liked the sound of the language itself). And in my opinion they did a great job in this episodes aswell. Giving (the real) Sasori the voice of Ichigo from Bleach (don't know the actor's name) was a very good choice here and he's doing very well.
For fans of the dub there's a nice little special feature included: The ""Shippuden Quiz Show"". It's funny if you like seeing the actors behind the voices goofing around.

The box comes with three single DVD-cases with very nice drawn covers of different characters.

The Deidara-Minininja included in the special edition is well made and a joy for every die-hard fan (but probably only for those).

Overall: Absolutly a must-have for Narutofans. Upcoming fans should watch the original Naruto series first.

Can't wait for the next box, keep it up viz!",1275436800,2,1257,4.59375

4075605,5,B0036BDQ88,"Since 1999, ""Naruto"" created by Masashi Kishimoto (""Karakuri"") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.

For the anime series, since 2002, ""Naruto"" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes. The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.

Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities. The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need. But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.

Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities. For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions. He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older. Of course, there is so much involved in the ""Naruto"" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series.

""Naruto"", the first series ended with the young ninja leaving to train with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years.

Here we are now with ""Naruto Shippuden"" (Naruto: Hurricane Chronicles), a sequel to the ""Naruto"" series and with the release of the second volume featuring episodes 14-26.

In the first volume, Team Kakashi which consists of Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura are dispatched to the sand village after news that the Akatsuki (a criminal organization which includes powerful ninjas who defected from their villages and a group which include Sasuke's brother Itachi) members Deidara and Sasori have attacked the village and are after Gaara.  While the three hurry to get to the sand village, Lady Tsunade sends out Team Guy to provide as support (consisting of Might Guy, Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga and Tenten).

With Gaara taken hostage by the Akatsuki, Gaara's brother Kankuro tries to save him but is stopped by Sasori of the Red Sand who literally beats Kankuro and injects him with poison, so he can suffer and die within three days.  Fortunately, Team Kakashi arrives and Sakura is there to use her medic skills to stop the poison but now they must go and save Gaara with the help of  one of the elders of the Sand Village, Grandma Chiyo. Who happens to also be the grandmother of Sasori.

Here is a brief spoilerless summary of the episodes 14-26 for ""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2: Season One"" included on three DVD's:

DISC 4:

  * EPISODE 14 - Naruto's Growth - The Akatsuki clan sends out Kisame to stop Team Guy while Itachi is sent to stop Team Kakashi.

  * EPISODE 17 - The Death of Gaara! - Akatsuki seal Gaara's beast which could be fatal for Gaara.

DISC 5:

  * EPISODE 18 - Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry!! - Team Guy is dispatched to destroy the barrier around the Akatsuki hideout.
  * EPISODE 19 - Traps Activate! Team Guy's Enemies - What was believed to be barrier seals ends up being a trap for Team Guy.
  * EPISODE 20 - Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi! - Grandmother Chiyo briefs Sakura on Sasori and prepares her for battle.
  * EPISODE 21 - Sasori's Real Face - Chiyo and Sakura vs. Sasori (who reveals his true form).

DISC 6:

  * EPISODE 22 - Chiyo's Secret Skills - Chiyo has to resort to using new puppets against Sasori in battle.
  * EPISODE 23 - Father and Mother - Sasori unleashes his Iron Sand technique on Chiyo and Sakura.
  * EPISODE 24 - The Third Kazekage - Sasori uses the third Kazekage puppet against Sakura and Chiyo.
  * EPISODE 25 - Three Minutes Between Life and Death - The battle continues between Chiyo, Sakura versus Sasori and with Sakura using an antidote to stop the poison, she has only three minutes to defeat Sasori before the antidote wears off.
  * EPISODE 26 - Puppet fight: 10 vs. 100! - Chiyo uses her ""Ten Puppets of Chikamatsu"" versus Sasori's ""One Hundred Puppet Manipulation Jutsu"".

VIDEO:

One thing I noticed when it came to ""Naruto"" is that the series has had its share of well-animated and well-painted artistic backgrounds but then for some of the filler episodes, has had a decrease in quality. Fortunately, ""Naruto Shippuden"" looks awesome. I really like how the characters look much older and the emotions on the character's faces to the action that takes place in the Sand Village is pretty cool.

For the most part, these episodes for this box set is focused on battles, so a lot of the background scenes take place in a cave, above cliff-like areas or a hill.  So, there is more focus on the characters and the fighting sequences rather than overall setting.  But for the most part, the action was captured quite well and fans should be happy.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, audio is pretty much Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 Bilingual (Japanese and English). Similar to a series like ""Dragon Ball Z"", with ""Naruto"", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series. It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.  Especially Maile Flanagan's Naruto Uzumaki.  Personally, I didn't think there would be a voice actor that could capture Junko Takeuchi's Naruto vocals and sure enough, Flanagan does a great job.  But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.

Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" comes with the following special features:

  * Voice Actor Featurette: Sand vs. Leaf - Interactive Quiz Show - A video-based quiz show with the voice talents of ""Naruto Shippuden"" all competing (viewer needs to choose the correct answer and will be awarded points for getting 100 points).  Competing are Michael Lindsay (Kankuro), Liam O'Brien (Gaara), Tara Platt (Temari), Maile Flanagan (Naruto), Kate Higgins (Sakura), Dave Wittenberg (Kakashi) and a mystery host!
  * Relationship Chart: Team Guy - A text based feature showing the relationship of Team Guy: Might Guy, Rock Lee, Neji and Tenten.
  * Production Art - Using your remote, you can view 16 production art images.
  * Viz Media Trailers - Trailers for upcoming or current Viz Media releases.

EXTRAS:

""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" comes with a slip case. It's important to note that the limited edition box set contains a mini ninja Naruto and an exclusive art card.

JUDGMENT CALL:

First, let me start out with how awesome ""Naruto Shippuden"" has been so far.  No slowdown or any weak filler episodes, so far every episode since the first have been all action-packed and intense.  ""Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut"" continues that as the Konoha Leaf Village ninjas take on members of the Akatsuki.

But with this volume, Sakura fans will be happy with this latest volume as we see how much Sakura has grown up and how her training as a ninja has literally brought her power to new heights.  Not only is she a medical ninja, she is now among the most powerful members with her ability to evade but also her ability of massive strength.  Never before have we seen Sakura put into a situation like this.  She was always the ninja that stood behind Naruto or Sasuke but no more.

To watch Sakura and Grandmother Chiyo take on Sasori, this battle was action-packed, well-planned and it doesn't end quickly, there is a good build up of episodes and the cliffhanger that you are left with at the end of volume six makes you wanting even more!

And also, it's not just Sakura that gets the spotlight in this volume, but we also get to see Team Guy in battle.  Especially Might Guy as he takes on Kisame Hoshigaki and seeing Rock Lee, Neji and Tenten get into it as well.  So, for the most part, it was great to see the characters all fighting in this episode and it makes you wonder when we will see Team 8 in battle.

Overall, there are quite a bit of surprises, twists and turns but for the most part, another exciting, action-packed volume of ""Naruto Shippuden""!  Definitely recommended!",1272412800,23,9251,4.666872682323857

4075607,5,B0036BDQ88,"When I first watched the Naruto series I hated Sakura, she was annoying, weak and Sasuke obsessed. When Naruto Shippuden came out and I saw Sakura, I was like the only thing that's changed is her height and her outfit. Well I had forgotten that Sakura had requested to train under the Fifth Hokage Tsunade.

Then when Sakura and Naruto were training with Kakashin to get the bells she proved to me that she didn't spend two years doing nothing. I am truly pleased by her great growth in knowledge, medical skills and physical abilities.  Now only if Hinata can be shown more, I would like to see how far she has advanced as well.",1271203200,7,629,4.460869565217391

4075609,5,B0036BDQ88,"For fans of Sakura Haruno and even for those who may not yet be, this DVD set is an absolute MUST HAVE!

Yes, this is Naruto Uzimaki's show and most of the big battles are rightfully his, but the main battle chronicled in Volume 2 of Naruto Shippuden is Sakura's, and it's as big and intense as ANY of Naruto's fights.  Seriously!  I read the manga version of these episodes about a year ago and have been itching ever since to see it in anime.  I suppose I could log onto the NS video website and see these episodes, but I'd rather not spoil the thrill of seeing them on high def DVD.

Here's a brief rundown.  Naruto and Kakashi, I believe, are going after Gaara's assailants while Sakura and Granny Chiyo remain behind to face another rogue ninja, Chiyo's grandson, Sasori.  Sasori's mastery of the puppet-based jutsus puts Kankuro's to shame.  Sasori's only rival in this respect is his grandmother.  With Chiyo's wisdom and Sakura's young, strong body and healing skills, they may have a chance against Sasori.",1265068800,20,1015,4.625698324022347

Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

4075767,3,B0036BDQ88,"Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 Season One: Original & Uncut is a three DVD set that contains episodes fourteen through twenty-six of Naruto Shippuden.  The first two discs contain four episodes and extras, while the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.

The first disc has three extras included.  The first is a set of trailers, which start automatically when you select the trailers option; four trailers are included.  The second feature is listed as ""New From Viz Media.""  The link takes you to four pages of advertisements: one page for Shonen Jump magazine, one page for Naruto, and two pages for other Shonen Jump titles. The third link is ""Online Features""; all this contains is a screen that shows where to purchase Viz Media titles online.

The second disc also has three extras.  The first one is ""Trailers,"" and it includes five trailers.  ""New From Viz Media"" is the exact same feature included on the first disc.  The ""Online Features"" screen included on this disc is the exact same as what appears on disc one.

The third disc has seven extras.  The first is ""Trailers,"" which contains six trailers.  ""New From Viz Media"" and ""Online Features"" are exactly the same as what appeared on the first two discs.  Next is ""Voice Actor Featurette: Naruto Shippuden Quiz Show.""  This feature is a quiz game where the viewers answer questions, and footage of the voice actors in the studio (who are also answering the questions) is cut in.  There are two teams: one made up of the English voice actors for the Sand Siblings (Gaara, Kankuro, and Temari), and the other team is made up of the English voice actors for Team Kakashi (Kakashi, Naruto, and Sakura).  There are ten questions in all.  At the end of this feature is an ""Easter Egg,"" which are ""Naruto Bloopers""; this is made up of the voice actors making mistakes while recording lines for the dub, and of the ADR Director making mistakes while reading questions from the quiz show.

""Relationship Chart: Team Guy"" has the user select an image to see how the characters on the team connect.  Included in this feature are Guy, Rock Lee, Tenten, and Neji.  ""Production Art"" has 16 screens of production sketches of the characters.  The final extra is ""English Credits,"" where you can see the credits for the English dub.

I still don't understand why Viz Media decided to include extras on all three discs, especially since many of the extras are duplicated between them.  Also, it doesn't make sense that the disc with five episodes contains the bulk of the bonus features; it makes it feel like there's wasted space on the first two discs.  It would have been better to spread the extras out between the three discs in order to cut down on the overlap.

The episodes in this set feature Team Kakashi and Team Guy on a mission to try and rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki organization, as well as all of the battles they must face.  However, the storyline is not concluded in these episodes; in fact, the final episode in the set leaves you on a major cliffhanger.  I'm not sure if ending with such a cliffhanger was simply luck, but it was a nice touch.  For those viewers who are really into the story, it should convince them to go on to the next volume in the DVD sets to see how things turn out.  If you're a fan of Naruto Shippuden and want to own the series on DVD by buying box sets, then this set is the way to go.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1313452800,2,3513,4.565495207667731
4075768,3,B0036BDQ88,"Worth the money, not as much action, more information leading into the story line, excellent dvd quality, no problems.

4075769,5,B0036BDQ88,"The second box set was awesome. The dub was great and flowed nicely. There were only a few moments that seemed a bit awkward, but that was bound to happen and the dubbers were at no fault. The humor stayed strong and was not dulled at all during translation. My family also enjoyed the first and second box sets and, although they are practically new to the show, they're eager to buy the third.
