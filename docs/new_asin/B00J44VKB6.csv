William ""Wild Bill"" Elliott is always top notch and the p;pot lines in these two ""Red Ryder"" entries is very good. It appears that the product was taken from 16mm prints and not cleaned up a great deal. It is a a worthy addition to the catalogue for those who like ""Wild Bill"" as ""Red Ryder"".  Bobby Blake is very good as ""Little Beaver"". he has a knack of being enjoyable, intersting and unobtrusive at the same time unlike many child stars.",1516924800,,553,4.368932038834951
