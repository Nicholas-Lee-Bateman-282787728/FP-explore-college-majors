8339505,5,B001S86JH6,Rick Steves always provides an up close and personal look at the places that he visits.  He makes me feel that I am on the journey with him.,1377043200,,140,4.0

8339507,4,B001S86JH6,"I'm giving this DVD only four stars because of the quality of (only) two shows. Greek Isles and Turkey. I bought this DVD pretty much to get a good look at Santorini. The programs preceeding the Santorini episode looked incredibly good on my HD TV. Crystal clear picture with briliant colors. But when it came to Santorini, it looked like it was filmed with a regular video camera! The picture isn't terrible and the color isn't bad, but it's certainly not even close to the quality of the rest of the other programs. And Turkey is the same. Other than that, the videos are full of great information and spectacular scenery. Rick always does a great job.
I just wish Santorini and Turkey were in HD!",1299974400,4,699,4.555555555555555

8339509,5,B001S86JH6,"As part of my pre-trip planning and not being familiar with Greece or Turkey I bought several DVD's including this one. By far the best one hands down in the whole stack. Very informative and entertaining. Covers Athens & Side trips, Greece Peloponnese, Greek Isl, Istanbul, Eastern, Central and Western Turkey. Should come with a notepad to takes notes on tips given. I would only recommend this to my close friends & family. All kidding aside you simply can't go wrong with any of Rick Steve's guides, ebooks or podcasts. I have all three types. Each one is designed for specific phase of your trip so I highly recommend that you consider purchasing this along with one of his guide books (either hardback or ebook) both have detailed walking tours from a local's perspective that allows you to avoid the masses who don't know any better (because they read the other guide books). Lastly, another reason to get the accompanying ""ebook"" guidebook is because some of them come with audio tours as well.",1280707200,9,1002,4.797687861271676
