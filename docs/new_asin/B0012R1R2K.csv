8311038,3,B0012R1R2K,"Moving away from the story in order to develop new relationships between the characters was a bold move that does not pay off this time. Having spent so little time developing the supporting cast in earlier episodes, these episodes play out as drawn out and boring and by the time they get back to the primary story, it's hard to really care. Being that we're only at the halfway point though and this volume ends on a note that I certainly didn't see coming, I'm willing to bet that this series will make a nice comeback and find a way to regain its momentum for the second half. This one though we'll chalk up as a tragic misstep.",1213747200,,632,4.364406779661017
