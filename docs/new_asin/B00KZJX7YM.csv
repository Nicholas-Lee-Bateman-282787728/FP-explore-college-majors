8662872,1,B00KZJX7YM,This is terrible. This is titled Dazzling Dunks and Basketball Bloopers and is definitely not. Its an unwatchable sequel. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONY TRASH!!! This is not what you think you're getting. I bought this to watch this my son bc I watched the VHS on loop when I was his age...and I bought a lie. Sad!,1516924800,,310,4.362068965517241
8662873,1,B00KZJX7YM,Not the original... Just a waste of time and money to watch Laden try to make a sequel out of something that was originally timeless,1464998400,,132,4.32
