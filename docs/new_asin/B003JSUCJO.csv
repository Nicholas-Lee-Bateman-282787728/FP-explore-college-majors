8398453,5,B003JSUCJO,"I'd have to say its nice to see this after many years of listening to this show on an old cassette. It's a remarkable show and one that any Bob Marley fan should own.  What makes this show a stand out is that the only other show currently out on video from the 79 Survival Tour is the Santa Barbara Bowl show which I too heartily recommend.  I think might be the only show where ""wake up and live"" jams into ""Zimbabwe"" and then back in to ""wake up and live"".  The band is tight and Bob put on such a powerful performance that many people were so blown away they didn't stay for the headliner- the Commodores.  Seeing as the only footage id seen before getting this DVD had a time stamp running across the bottom- this will be something to view again and again.  I'll also point out that I also bought a copy of Bob's show from Germany 1980 on DVD at the same time- which my only experience of was from a bad tv-tape transfer and this DVD was an upgrade. Both videos are good by me and capture a legend onstage at his best.",1383955200,2,1022,4.115577889447236
