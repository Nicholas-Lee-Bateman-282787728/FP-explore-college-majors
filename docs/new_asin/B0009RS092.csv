8065954,5,B0009RS092,"Some sociologists say that in America all racism is White Racism. In other words, any black racism is a reaction to what whites have done to blacks over the years. This DVD makes that case in a very striking way, but showing us older documentary footage of blacks in America speaking about their experiences trying to live the American dream. It's heartbreaking to see what we have done to these people over the years, but also heartwarming to see American Blacks work hard to overcome the racist barriers in their lives.",1147996800,9,521,4.736263736263736
8065955,5,B0009RS092,"In the world I live in the idea that blacks are equal to whites is taken for granted. I've never really seen hardcore racism in my lifetime.

Of course, I've read in history books about the civil rights movement and slavery, so I ordered this disk in order to try to learn more.

All I can say is that it was a real learning experience. The DVD consists of a series of films documenting the state of the African American experience in America from the depression up unil the early 1970s and it was much bleaker than I thought.

What made the disk not too depressing for me was the clips about how black people were still able to be happy and work to overcome the great wrongs society was doing to them.",1146096000,8,702,4.2631578947368425
