*Plot and ending analyzed*

Appointment with Destiny, Showdown at O.K. Corral (1972) is a really interesting look at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory on Wednesday, October 26, 1881. It features the narration of Lorne Greene, no stranger to Westerns (The Hard Man (1957), The Last of the Fast Guns (1958), The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (TV Movie 1987), Nevada Smith (1975) (TV) and Bonanza (1959 - 1973) ).

It is made to resemble a live documentary, as if there were film cameras at that time. The characters swat at the camera, or get angry at being filmed. It is also filmed in sepia tone.

Characters are also interviewed, one of them was played by Neil Summers, a crowd stand-in and stuntman that was in Death Valley Days (TV Series 1952-1970), Squirrel in My Name Is Nobody (1973), and stunts The Last Hard Men (1976).

It all leads up to the Gunfight, which is examined in slow-motion.

It's been hard to find, but it is now on a Western DVD collection.

Highly recommended for Gunfight at the O.K. Corral enthusiasts, Western film lovers and Western history aficionados.",1513296000,,1154,4.768844221105527
