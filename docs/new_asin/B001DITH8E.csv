3532559,1,B001DITH8E,"Absolutely disgraceful series. I've watched about 2 eps and couldn't stand it anymore!  I could literally point out all the mistakes in the reconstructions of the extinct animals in each episode! Also, they assume an awaful lot of things. They go from bite marks in a jawbone, to a fight over a baby Manjungasaurus! (incorrectly named manjungalothus). Among the inaccurate reconstruction was a Deinonychus which had its hands postitioned in the wrong place and an over-sized megalodon shark. All this is just to make them look scarier, and more frightening. Another extremlly anoying thing is that this is approx a 1hr long show, which should really be about half that, because the first half of the show is spent stating and re-stating facts about the two competing animals. VERY poor quality documentary, the directors should be ashamed.",1230508800,11,839,5.124087591240876
3532560,5,B001DITH8E,"I instantly pre-ordered this DVD set. I get the episodes on iTunes now, but this is such an incredible show, I feel I must have it on DVD as well. I am friends with some of the paleontologists featured in Jurassic Fight Club and they have gathered the most respected and credible minds in the field of Paleontology for this phenomenal series. The animation is outstanding and the communication regarding the findings from various dig sites is well done and spoken in a way that the average viewer will easily comprehend. This is an absolute must if you are at all interested in dinosaurs or prehistoric life. I hope this show airs for years. I plan to purchase the episodes as long as they are available down the road.",1224547200,5,718,4.573643410852713

The build-up is fascinating, the experts (I love ""Dinosaur George"") are eloquent and knowledgeable.  The ""fight"" scenes are exciting to watch but, to me, the background info is what makes them exciting.  It's isn't just conjecture, but studying the fossils, the behavior of living animals, etc.  Then they put everything they learned on the scene in the finale.

Of course, the author had to supply a good deal of imagination to fill in the gaps between dinosaur bones and everyday dinosaur behavior. Educative information was provided by a series of experts. However, the announcer repeated the exact same things over and over. Soon, this became tedious and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Eventually, my wife and I tired of it.",1440201600,2,503,5.0

3532566,3,B001DITH8E,"this series is aimed more at a younger age group, around high school or middle school. I have watched three episodes so far with the one on Meg being the best better of the three. None of the information was really new to me, with shows like walking with dinosaurs being far more informative in my opinion. There is a lot of speculation that is being presented as fact, and that's kind of annoying. The basis for the show off of the three episodes I have watched is reconstructing a fight between two dino species. Its predator and pray with the normal cast of T- REX, Raptor, Allosaurus, and so on. video quality of the dinos is on par with shows that are similar and what you would expect from history channel. I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a ton of info on dinosaurs, but its an okay killer of 45 minutes. Each episode is like 1.99$. Buy one of the episodes that has a topic you might be interested in and maybe you will be surprised. Again I am not trying to pic on this show, but I prefer some of the other series out there",1437436800,,1047,4.266331658291457

3532568,1,B001DITH8E,"Disclaimer: I write this as a dinosaur enthusiast and paleontologist, so I might be more jaded than most. That being said, this is billed as a documentary so I feel completely justified in my rage.

Jurassic Fight Club takes dinosaurs into a whole new era of awful. Vague ideas presented as concrete facts, paleontologists quoted horrendously out of context, dinosaurs turned from living animals into sociopaths. I didn't have high hopes for a dinosaur documentary presented by the History Channel (even typing that gives me shivers,) but this was a disappointed even by my low expectations. Where to begin?

First, each episode is presented the same way: describe a real fossil site, talk to scientists, recreate the ""violent prehistoric battle"" (viewer discretion advised) based on the fossil evidence. While each episode claims to follow evidence from real fossil sites, they are all either (at best) ridiculous exaggerations of existing sites, or complete fabrications. I researched all of the ""sites"" and found most of them didn't exist. The paleontologists seem to support the show's evidence, but this is accomplished thru rearranged audio and clever edits. Granted, JFC isn't the first documentary to do this - but it might be the worst offender I've encountered.

Nobody should buy this documentary with the intent to LEARN from it. Its a bunch of gory fight scenes with dinosaurs with a few ""facts"" thrown in for the sake of the dinosaur buffs. All of the paleontologists have written excellent books and appeared in better documentaries. The dinosaurs themselves are inaccurate to an baffling extent, going beyond the typical ""they should have feathers"" argument. They're all bloodthirsty monsters, more fitting for a dinosaur slasher film than a ""documentary."" Its tragic, really . Dinosaurs are already some of the most fascinating animals to have ever lived, but JFC shuns the authentically fascinating facts in favor in two things: how many dinosaurs can be killed in one episode, and how gruesomely can they be killed? Ugh.

Jurassic Fight Club is the documentary - equivalent of sitting around a campfire telling ghost stories at summer camp. There are so many other dinosaur documentaries out there with more real information to share. If you just want to see dinosaurs violently kill each other, this is your show. But for the content - and the price ($69.98 used?!?) you can do better. A lot better.",1427673600,,2419,5.131979695431472

Other dinosaurs existed that were just as ferocious as T-rex and raptors. I highly recommend this series for all dinosaur enthusiasts.

they roamed, fought and survived

Yes the CGI effects are awsome, what I object to are the numerous, repetitive and frankly boring commentaries.

3532612,5,B001DITH8E,"Jurassic Fight Club is one of the best dinosaur specials I've ever watched. I've been a dinosaur nerd since I first saw Jurassic Park, (which I would also recommend all three of the movies and the books to anyone who loves dinosaurs.) This program is jam packed with information, it's amazing how much I learned while also enjoying special effects and simulated prehistoric battles. If you love dinosaurs like me or are just looking for entertainment, you've found it. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves prehistoric life and loves to learn.",1255305600,2,549,4.913978494623656
3532613,2,B001DITH8E,"There's about 10 minutes of really essential stuff in each episode, some good CGI and informed opinion. The rest is hyperbolic filler. More science and less tinsel would have made this a great deal more watchable.",1253664000,3,213,4.944444444444445
3532614,4,B001DITH8E,"It's really refreshing to see a show about dinosaurs that isn't aimed at children since I'm an adult now but I still find dinosaurs interesting.  The premise of Jurassic Fight Club is that a bunch of paleontologists look at dinosaur bones to reconstruct possible fights between two dinosaurs.  I think they do this pretty well.  Unlike a certain other show (cough, Animal Faceoff, cough) JFC is much more mature and does a better job of actually basing their recreation on evidence.  Now, some parts of the scenario are purely based on imagination, but this is to be expected since all they have to go on are fossils.  After all, the audience is meant to understand that the combat scenario presented isn't set in stone, but is merely a creative interpretation of evidence left in fossils such as bite marks or shed teeth.  I think they did a good job of presenting a healthy dose of facts along with speculation based on living animal relatives.  My only complaint concerning this series is that the whole thing is a little bit gimmicky.  I mean, just the title is gimmicky.  Also, MUST they use crime scene investigator lingo constantly?  I kept chuckling whenever they'd use the word ""crime"" to describe the killing of one dinosaur by another, especially since these animals had no concept of crime or a justice system and this word just sounds ludicrous when applied to them.  Other than that, the series is both entertaining and informative, and I would recommend it to those who like dinosaurs.",1247961600,4,1500,4.797665369649805
3532615,3,B001DITH8E,"At first I was really excited about this TV series, it looked very intense and up-to-date. However after watching a few episodes, I realized that Jurassic fight club isn't all it's cracked up to be.
First of all, there is nothing but cgi in it and alot of repeated footage, so it doesn't rely on it's visuals too much. Second is some of the facts are wrong and not based upon any real evidence. Third, is it can be boring at times, where not much is going on except the narrator explaing what has just been happening for the last fifty minutes.
Now, some of the positive things about jurassic fight club:
The cgi is (although not always) quite good and at times very detailed. Many of the facts are correct and there are alot of theories that make sense, most of which I've never even heard of. The fight scenes at the end are pretty brutal and vicious more often than not, and many of them are very violent.
In conclusion, if you don't mind watching scientists talk about dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures for an hour and then making them fight in recreated battle scenarios, you will most likely enjoy this TV show. And I am hoping for a second season",1244678400,5,1161,4.455399061032864
3532624,5,B001DITH8E,"Jurassic Fight Club delivered as promised!  The segments were a well organized combination of paleanthology, history, forensic science, and excellent CGI.  The viewer gets a quick snapshot of the science behind the recreations of lives and events millions of years ago, then gets to watch it all come together in dramatic combats as titans from eons past battle to the death for survival!  Keeping in mind the many gaps that necessarily exist when trying to piece together a life story from fossilized scraps of minerals from millions of years in the past ( a REALLY Cold Case!)the recreations are as well put together as they could be.  All in all, a true mixture of science, entertainment, history, and leviathon showdowns!",1239062400,,725,5.016666666666667
3532625,3,B001DITH8E,"I haven't watched every single episode that aired on the History Channel but I have seen more than half of them.  I take issue with the series in some areas for instance the Nanotyrannus vs T-rex episode.  My understanding is that the -Nanotyrannus is a juvinile T-rex or a legitimate genus- issue is still very much unsettled. There are plenty of other examples but I'll leave it at that. Yes, I'm a dinosaur nut and have been for long time so the technical errors tend to upset me. The science is well presented but then liberties are taken with it to produce an ""exciting"" battle. Tooth marks don't always equal a struggle and Mr. Blasing takes great liberties with the behavior of the animals in the series. Some of the ideas are plausible but that does not make them the only way this animal behaved.  I'll give Mr. Blasing points for enthusiasm but as has been said in other reviews he becomes annoying.  I understand the appeal it has because of the battles, the danger this series has is that the real science gets pushed aside  for the good storyline. I hope that if more episodes are made they stress the importance of the science, Mr. Blasing tones it down some and presents the fight as a possibility of what may have happened and not get caught up in telling a fantastic story.",1238025600,14,1290,4.51931330472103
3532626,5,B001DITH8E,"My sons (4) and (7) LOVED this!  We have watched it and watched it.  You know that the kids are watching and listening when they correct you on the sounds of the names.

3532628,4,B001DITH8E,"I hope that the viewer has the patience to stay with the series through the first half to the second half; it is worth it.  In the first half, ""Dinosaur George"" Blasing is annoying as a paleontologist-wannabee constantly intruding on what would otherwise be above average entertainment; a larger-than-life drama king trumpeting fiction as if it were all scientific fact like some snake-oil salesman hawking his product as a cure for everything under the sun.  I am most concerned that younger viewers would not be able to seperate his gyrating quest for ratings from legitimate scientific findings.  Fortunately, the series evolves to where ""Dinosaur George"" is merely annoying.  In the second half of the season, he tones it down, avoiding profering the various scenarios as proven blow-by-blow confrontations.  The special effects evolved as well.  What started as slightly above average became truly impressive footage that was often noteworthy and occasionally breath-taking.",1237075200,2,979,5.450331125827814

You've got state-of-the-art CGI footage of giant lizards tearing each other up! Love it! Then they throw in a couple scientists to talk about it like it's a CSI investigation, add a little more fancy computerized eye candy, and you've got season 1 on DVD.  It's great!

3532631,4,B001DITH8E,As another reviewer said there is a TON of speculation here. It's merely a what if? of dinosaur fights. It's a bit WWE style with alot of drama and the outcomes predetermined by one mans opinion but in the end it is a refreshing and 21st century way to study and learn about dinosaurs. They bring up alot of unusual breeds of dinosaurs the average person has never of.  There are alot of interesting situational battles based on the food and water supply which make it fun. Overall its definitely worth a watch if you are a casual dinosaur fan.,1234396800,,544,4.44
3532632,4,B001DITH8E,"One person gave ""JFC"" a single star, complaining about the accuracy of some of the material in the series.  His qualification for doing so, he said, is his passion for dinosaurs, which I do not doubt.  I would not presume to match knowledge with even a ten or 12-year-old dinosaur enthusiast...people who love dinosaurs tend to know a lot about them.  It's like the one ""fantasy"" we can indulge, because it's seen as factual fantasy.  If you're into World of Warcraft or Middle Earth or comic books, it can be looked down on as nerdy and useless, whereas knowing the name of every Triassic predator...well, you're still a nerd, but the knowledge itself seems less useless, because it's about the real world.  Or, a recreation of the real world, more accurately.

And that was our one-starring critic's complaint, that the recreators of this series played fast and loose with these ultimate cold cases (even using the language of crime scene investigation sometimes, to very mixed effect).  There is no doubt that the producers and animators have taken some spectacular guesses and have extrapolated far beyond what the often meager evidence would allow.  But this is NOT the O.J. Simpson trial.  It is, largely, a thin sciency-sounding excuse to put on some fantastic battle scenes.  Very few young boys (and many girls) will be immune to the excitement of watching two monsters clash.  It's Godzilla versus Mothra, except these fanatically enthusiastic paleontologists adding ringside color are legitimizing the whole thing with fossils and CAT scans and references to living animals.

And that's the series' undeniable strength.  The enthusiasm, even passion, for learning that it could engender in some kids formerly only interested in completely imaginary monsters.  Not that there's anything wrong with imaginary monsters--I happen to like several.  But to harness that imagination in the service of educated speculation in pursuit of more facts about our planet's fascinating history seems an even more noble pursuit.  This series has the capacity to ignite a passion for learning about dinosaurs.

My more substantive criticism of the ""JFC"" (I can't write that without thinking of Jersey Fried Chicken) shows is that the battle scenes are too slight to merit their build-up.  Working with usually sparse and fragmentary evidence and making gigantic hypothetical leaps takes up about 75 percent of the show, with the actual battle taking up only a quarter or so.  The easy fix here would be to make it a half-hour show, which would put the science speculation in proper balance with the battle scenes.

I also think the paleontologists could provide a lot more warning about the nature of the guesses they are making without damaging their enthusiasm or the excitement of the show.  There's nothing wrong with saying, ""We don't have enough information to know, but we think something a little like this might have happened.""  If anything, that might inspire a generation of budding paleontologists to work on creating techniques that would enable us to speculate with more and more plausibility.",1232928000,22,3101,5.135458167330677
