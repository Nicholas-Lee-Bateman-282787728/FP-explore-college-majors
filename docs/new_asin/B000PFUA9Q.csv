2818254,4,B000PFUA9Q,"As a fan of the show from when it first came out in the 1976-1978 period, I have always enjoyed the show. It's nice to see them again where we can see a number of actors who went on to bigger an better things, not to mention the lead Robert Conrad who seems to always present the tough guy image. Somehow, I strongly suspect in the real world it wasn't quite like the show, but it is usually enjoyable. I only wish they would have just put the whole works on one simple DVD set.",1186963200,,478,4.042105263157895
2818255,3,B000PFUA9Q,"Along with other fans of this show, I'm glad that finally after a 2 year wait Vol. 2 was released on DVD.

I bought this title a few weeks ago and must say that even though I'm very happy to have this show on DVD I'm also a bit disappointed in this DVD release out of the following reasons:

No digital restoration of the picture (but I can live with that)

What bugs me the most is that 5 episodes were crammed on each of disc 1 and disc 2 but disc 3 only holds two episodes. I think they should have divided it evenly up into 4 episodes per disc that way the studio doesn't have to compress the episodes so much and have a better picture quality. This might be a point that should be taken under consideration if Universal plans to release Vol. 3 of this show on DVD.

No specials on the dvd set.

The show itself receives 5 stars, but the DVD release only 3 stars because of the reasons mentioned above.",1186444800,63,906,4.096045197740113
2818256,5,B000PFUA9Q,"this is one of the best tv shows i ever ordered , the quality is very good.",1185753600,,75,3.4705882352941178
2818257,5,B000PFUA9Q,I love Robert Conrad in this series. Watched them every week. Sometime ago on the History Channel I would watch them every Saturday morning. Was very happy when I found Vol. 1 and now Vol. 2! When will Vol. 3 be released?,1185494400,,221,4.285714285714286
2818258,5,B000PFUA9Q,"Baa Baa Black Sheep Volume 2 - This is the second half of season one.

The series is loosely based on the actual exploits of the late Col. Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington, credited with 28 ""kills"" during the war and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor (CMH).  A true American hero.

All in all, a fun testosterone romp.

Perhaps Universal will release Season 2 in one complete package next go around.  And a voice over by one of the actors or producers would be a welcome edition.",1184198400,76,1279,4.56140350877193
2818259,5,B000PFUA9Q,"..now lets have Season 2 so we can finely watch the whole series! I couldn't hardly wait to get this DVD open when it came today. I've always enjoyed this show and will hopefully get the final season SOON. Come on guys. You must have the rest all ready to make on DVD! :) I have the books too, but the show is great. Follows the real Pappy loosely, but hey, it's still fun to watch. The plot keeps moving and the action seans are well done. When firing the maching guns in the plane however, the real thing doesn't vibrate like on the screen. I think it just adds to the action. Keep the good TV shows like this one comming you guys.

2818261,4,B000PFUA9Q,"One of the proudest claims I can make about my life is being a former Marine, like Maj. Gregory ""Gramps"" Boyington; albiet an unknown to one of the most famous. (John ""The Duke"" Wayne wanted to be a Marine & didn't make it!) The only thing that gives me more pride is knowing these heroes respected guys like my sainted Dad, an Army Air Corps pilot, who flew gas & trash over ""the Hump"" in C-46's & C-47's (the gray cargo plane in the series) from India into China over the Himalayas in support of their combat against the Japs.

I was at NAS Lakehurst in 1978 when this great show aired on commercial T.V. and, even though most of us knew the show was highly 'Hollywoodized', we would still take over the barracks rec room everytime it aired, and would yell & cheer like Limey football fans thru every combat scene in each episode.

With all the second- and third-rate crapola flooding the DVD-TV market these days, it's GREAT to see DVD's of a show worth the expense hit the shelves, and I really hope the entire series will be issued sooner or later (PREFERREDLY SOONER!!!!!!)",1180051200,22,1079,4.472081218274112

Then a Second STAR reappears a segment later on his collar....notice the female nurses in 70s style hair and clothes...Conrad as well as Red West held the second season together. Kudos to season one. The plots and original crew we're great as well as cameos of the real Gregory Boyington. The show had potential to be a long running hit.

2818359,5,B000PFUA9Q,"Love this series.  This dvd set is great.  Comes in 2, 2disc plastic cases in an outer cardboard sleeve.  The picture and sound is very good.  They could have balanced the shows out a bit though, they have 5 on the first disc, 5 on the second, and 2 on the last disc.  They could have just put 4 on each disc since they were going with 3 discs anyway.  Just a nitpick, doesn't affect the quality any.  I had been waiting years to buy these.  The regular price is ridiculous for a 1/2 season set.  Luckily they dropped to $13 a while back and I snatched them up.

If only they would release the second season  on dvd...",1428624000,3,618,4.109243697478991

2818361,5,B000PFUA9Q,"The series was very good until the introduction of ""Pappy's Lambs"" midway through season 2. If you'll notice, John Larroquette and Robert Ginty are no longer credited or show up after the lambs, with 70's hairstyles, are brought on board along with a kid pilot with long blonde hair. I guess they said no way would they be part of that. This was done to boost ratings but didn't. I can't believe Robert Conrad went along with this, but it turns out that one of the lambs was his real life daughter. This was a cheap ploy which degraded the series. Red West was a hoot as Micklin, but even he was made second fiddle to the lambs which the last episodes were centered around. Real shame.",1427587200,,685,4.4015748031496065

The audio quality of volume 1 was great.  The vocals were balanced well with the background noise.  I would sometimes have to lower the volume during the dog-fight scenes, but that was to help keep the peace in the house more than anything else.
But, volume 2 isn't mixed well at all.  I have a 7.1 receiver and have tried every surround option on it trying to keep the vocals from getting lost underneath the background noise (music, jungle, camp noise, etc.).  No setting has worked, it is quite annoying.  And there is no audio option in the menu.",1420934400,5,665,4.462809917355372

2818471,4,B000PFUA9Q,"When I was a teenager, Baa Baa Black Sheep was one of my favorite TV Show's and I was very disappointed when it was taken off the air, after such a short run. Admitably the storyline wasn't very realistic at times, but the aircraft, props, uniforms where always very well done and I always enjoyed the flying scenes. I missed some of the episodes, when it was on TV in Australia, but now that I have Volumes 1 & 2 on DVD, I can watch it whenever I want! I can't wait until Season Two is released on DVD!!",1245024000,7,504,4.101010101010101
2818472,1,B000PFUA9Q,"Ok here is another example of anything by Universal screwing the customer.
I've waited a year and a half and they still haven't released the final set. Which by the way should have been included in Vol 2.
So like all things from Universal (Quincy ME and many others) they screw us from getting the COMPLETE series.
Just don't buy anything from them until the whole series has been released.
This is the only way they are going to stop this non sense.",1232755200,11,450,4.433734939759036
2818473,3,B000PFUA9Q,Love the Corsairs but think a love interest always ruins a good war movie/show. Keep those nurses off the island. Enjoyed the aircraft much more than some of the story lines.,1229731200,,174,4.645161290322581

2818476,4,B000PFUA9Q,"It was as I remembered when it was first on television. This irreverant look at life as a marine pilot, was a roitious adventure.  Greg 'Pappy' Boyington bent, broke, shattered the naval regulations every chance he could. although far fetched at times, the series held true to the spirit of the book.

The ONLY complaint is that it takes 2 purchases to recieve ALL of season one. (who are these guys? Columbia House??)

When is the second season going to draw its' sights on the populas??",1212192000,13,488,4.651162790697675

2818479,4,B000PFUA9Q,"It's has been too long since the earlier release of The Black Sheep. This time we get not only Major Pappy Boyington (Robert Conrad)and his band of misfits who turn out to be the terror of the skies. We are introduced to Sgt Micklin (Red West) this cigar chomping, no respect for authority marine mechanic joins the squadron. Conrad and West are constantly challenging each other to see just who is top dog, with a few punches thrown in. (*side note he was a member of Elvis's Memphis Mafia)

Good stories however one can almost detect the same dogfight sequences. In fact if you look closely on some of the aircraft you can see the smoke apparatus that is used when a plane takes a hit. The stories alone are good enough to get you through those tacked on scenes. But if you like a good story especially about Marines and their planes this is for you.",1209254400,2,852,4.426751592356688

The series is alot of fun if you keep the right frame of mind and as I said before, you cannot beat the Warbirds in it, not just the Corsairs.",1204243200,4,348,3.915492957746479

All of the characters have returned in this set: Robert Conrad (Boyington), Dirk Blocker (Bragg), Larry Minetti (Boyle), James Whitmore, Jr. (Gutterman), W.K. Stratton (Casey), John Larroquette (Anderson), Robert Ginty (T.J.),  Jeff McKay (French), Dana Elcar (Col. Lard), and Simon Oakland (Gen. Moore).

I purchased this DVD set a few days ago, and I've already watched all of the episodes contained on it.  Watching this series takes me back to when it was on television.  I couldn't wait for Tuesday nights so I could see the Black Sheep in action.  Admittedly, some of the storylines are a little far-fetched, but its still fun to watch Boyington and his boys slug it out with the Japanese Zeroes.

I give this fine collection my highest recommendation.  The action is tremendous, and its fun to watch the Black Sheep and all of their adventures (and misadventures)!  Buy this set along with the first one and experience one of the great television shows of the 70s.  Highly recommended.",1187740800,8,1233,4.8798076923076925
