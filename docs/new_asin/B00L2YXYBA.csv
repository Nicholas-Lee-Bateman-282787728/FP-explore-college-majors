8663482,5,B00L2YXYBA,"Poignant and touching, learning the lives and backgrounds of the musicians made the music sound so much more tragic. Brave men, and even braver souls were lost in the sinking. I enjoyed this documentary a great deal---recommend highly.",1512172800,,235,5.2105263157894735
8663483,5,B00L2YXYBA,This was a great documentary if you want to learn about the men that played music on the Titanic. Pretty interesting to learn about how they got the opportunity to play on the grandest ship and how hard they had to work in order to make their names known!,1500076800,,255,4.224489795918367
8663484,2,B00L2YXYBA,"Rather boring, lots of repetitive comments on what they thought of the band members.",1477267200,,84,5.071428571428571
8663485,5,B00L2YXYBA,"In almost every history, film, and account of the tragic events of the sinking of the Titanic, somewhere therein lies a brief account of the music heard by the passengers that fateful morning the Titanic struck the iceberg and sank, as told by the survivors .  And that is where the accounts of the musicians who braved the cold, fear and ultimate knowledge of their combined fates that dreadful morning usually ends.

When I discovered this movie on Amazon prime, it peaked my interest, and for $3.99, I thought it might be worth a look.  Much to my very pleasant surprise, what unfolded was a beautifully told, well documented and historically accurate history of each of the 8 brave men who made up the team of musicians who played together for the very first and last time, that eventful night.  The history of each man is told, as photos of them, their families, as well as the places they would have grown up, visited and learned each of their crafts are portrayed, all while a young cast of present day musicians play the same songs they were playing that fateful evening.

The movie is beautifully made, packed with history as we get to learn much more about 8 real-life examples of real heroes as they face overwhelming fear and tragedy.  Each of them continues to play on, even though they are facing a certain death, as well as the dashing of their expected new lives in America; a new bride, a return to family,  a brighter musical future, a family and new opportunities ahead.  In a few brief fateful hours upon the frigid Northern Atlantic aboard this 5-day old ""unsinkable"" , Titanic, these brave eight men, provided comfort and courage to thousands as they either tried to survive the frigid waters aboard tiny, wooden life rafts, or, as they prepared to meet their maker as the ship sank lower and lower to their watery grave.  All this as they played their last song forever, ""Nearer My God to Thee.""

If you have ever wanted to know more about the musicians who bravely played on, this movie should be gratifying to say the least, and should not disappoint.",1470960000,,2076,4.632152588555858

8663487,5,B00L2YXYBA,"This is a OUTSTANDING documentary.  It's very moving and extremely well made. It even includes a cd of the songs played by the band of courage.  The music plays throughout this film as we hear it , we learn the stories of the eight men whose bravery still touches people today.  We learn their names and we hear interviews , meanwhile there is a band playing the music of that terrible night in April , 1912.  Not only do you get a feel for the men but also  how terrifying it must have been as they played right up to the last moments.  They did it to calm people , but at the end they did it in resignation of the death that they were going to along with so many others that night.  This film should be watched by everyone , it's so great and spiritual  These men give me hope  in the goodness that people are capable of even in our sick world.  This film should be watched with young people so they can see what a real hero is. It's not some gangster it's those who give to others and sacrifice.  Experts speak and tell  of us of the disaster and the men. We learn of their journeys to the ship. The band leader was only going on this ship one way as he married  a wealthy girl recently. One was to be a father.  Several were Frenchmen. The eldest was looking to escape a bad marriage.  We learn of how they lived on the ship , where they played each day and night.  And worst of all we learn that they were hired , not by white star line , but instead by a music company to work on the ship and no insurance was paid out to their relatives. Which doesn't surprise me at all.  Watch this film , it's truly great and you will learn what greatness is from average men facing the worst possible fate.",1435968000,4,1700,4.072289156626506
