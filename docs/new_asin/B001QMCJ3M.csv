8414987,4,B001QMCJ3M,"I saw this documentary on Sundance channel a few months ago, and ended up showing it to most of my non-jewish friends as soon as possible. This doc is highly entertaining, shocking at times, but still  maintaining a sense of humor about that subject matter that's never inappropriate. I recommend this film for anyone Jewish or not, who struggles with the meaning of ""Jewish Identity"", or anyone who has convinced themselves that anti-semitism has been relegated to Eastern Europe and the Deep South.
This won't answer questions everyone has on the subject, but it will provoke plenty of discussion and reflection among the people who watch it.",1240272000,5,644,5.018691588785047
