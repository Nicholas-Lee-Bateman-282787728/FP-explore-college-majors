7957444,3,B000060MWB,"It is okay, Daniel Craig is the only interesting part of the movie which I thought was basically boring,  not something I would see twice. But on the other hand someone else may really like this type of movie so it really depends on the viewer.",1440374400,3,244,4.304347826086956

7957446,2,B000060MWB,"I have to say, it surprises me to stand out from my fellow reviewers.  I started watching this for Greta Scacchi and Daniel Craig, both of whom I usually really like.  I turned it off after an hour.  I just couldn't bear it. To me, if it wasn't for the obviously professional costume design, this would be one or two steps (small steps) from a high school production. The writing was stilted and stiff. The acting did nothing to mitigate the problem with the writing. The characters - as a result of poor writing and mediocre acting - are caricatures. Daniel Craig's character seemed to me a cartoon! The whole thing was difficult to take seriously and felt rather like an insult to my intelligence. I almost never stop a movie before it's over, but this seemed a silly waste of time.",1409097600,2,784,4.507042253521127
7957447,3,B000060MWB,"The acting in this movie is wonderful, but the story itself is horrible.  There are lots of twists and turns, most of which come completely out of the blue and with no explanation.  The viewer is left lost for most of the movie.",1250553600,3,228,4.27906976744186
7957448,1,B000060MWB,"Yes, the stars act their heads off, dressed and not.  But the story is so poorly written and the characters so unbelievable that it's not worth the time.....and effort..... it takes.",1242172800,5,182,4.870967741935484
7957449,5,B000060MWB,"I was shocked to discover the gothic psychosexual romance, ""Love and Rage"" is a based on true events. Beautifully filmed in the rugged splendors of rural Ireland this film begins like a true romance novel, independent willful woman ahead of her time falls in love with wild rogue of a lower social level. It seems very Thomas Hardy full of repressed longing and sudden volcanic passions set amidst a storm tortured sea coast, mossy crags and a gloriously foreboding manor house. Buy the end the film turns from this formula melodrama into something truly evil and disturbing.
  Greta Scacchi is perfectly cast in her roll of English landlord Agnes MacDonnell. With her careworn beauty she carries a grace and command throughout the film. At first regal and above those Irish that surround her the fall she takes upon meeting James Lynchehaun is spectacular in its bravery as and actress and harrowing in her portail of the ultimate price she pays for her passions.
  Daniel Craig is mesmerizing in creating the madness and seductive sensuality of Lynchehaun. His dark twist on a classic romantic ideal is riveting to watch as he slithers from classic romantic bad boy hero into truly insane stalker. ""Love And Rage"" strange and hypnotic as it is becomes another feather in the cap for this fine actor's repertoire. As the story unfolded I found myself hoping against hope that the early eerie flashes of his instability were only genre quirks in the Heathcliff vein. Alas they were Hell's preternatural lightning of the madness to come. Brilliantly Craig grabbed my imagination and drug me willingly along the delusionary ride to the films final superbly bizarre and satisfying end.",1231891200,17,1682,4.996428571428571
7957450,4,B000060MWB,"This movie is based on a bizarre true story.

Agnes (Greta Scacchi)is a wealthy Englishwoman in late 1800's Ireland who owns an estate in a small Irish village.  She enjoys scandalizing the locals by being a divorced woman who smokes, drinks, and rides horses astride on her vast property.

When she sees James (Daniel Craig) at a local country fair she becomes immediately fascinated by the wild, blue-eyed Irishman who wins a brutal horserace.

James is younger than her, and beneath her social status...entirely inappropriate.  But this is a woman who thrives on being seen as scandalous, so she enters into an affair with James with relish & delight.

He's a wild man, as well as a bit of a con artist, and the fact that they both seem to delight in taunting ""proper"" society seems to please her that much more.

But as time passes his wild behavior becomes more & more erratic, and eventually it becomes downright scary.  He's unstable, and she's realizing it much too late, after he's insinuated himself pretty deeply into her isolated life.

The movie is a little uneven in quality, and slow in parts.  But those interested in Daniel Craig will find this a fascinating movie.  Because of the con-artist tendencies of his character he assumes a variety of guises, accents & costumes, and as an actor I'm sure he had fun with the role.  Greta Scacchi, as always, delivers a fine top-notch performance.",1211932800,27,1406,4.788381742738589
7957451,3,B000060MWB,"This is a strange movie indeed. Although it is marred by a story line that is hard to follow, the film is redeemed ultimately by the acting of both Greta Scacchi (Agnes MacDonnell) who at times resembles Emma Thompson and Daniel Craig who plays a character named James Lynchehaun. Much of the action takes place in Ireland in 1896 and indeed is about both love and rage. MacDonnell, a well-to-do restless woman has a torrid but ultimately devastating affair with Lynchehaun, a passionate man beneath her station.

The plot has many strange and unlikely twists and turns; the print-- at least in the DVD I rented-- is almost impossible to read; and the film needed a better editor. On a positive note, however,  in addition to the fine acting by Scacchi and Craig, the scenery is exquisitely photographed and a joy to behold.",1164240000,19,824,4.755244755244755
