Are we ever going to get a visually clear and beautiful film image of our planet, I mean haven't we been out in space for fifty years now? I think its a conspiracy...because if we finally get to see how wonderful the place we all inhabit is, then a few of us just may change our minds on how we go about our business here!
I would wait for the real thing, if it ever comes!",1220400000,,641,4.136
8109144,1,B000EGDCI2,"This is the most boring DVD ever!!! They fly around earth and with subtitles they tell you what part of the world you are looking at. After the first 10 min you will probably fall asleep and if not, The entire world will look the same exept for the subtitles.",1170979200,4,259,4.2
8109145,1,B000EGDCI2,"First let me say that I love to see anything about space and I was excited to see a dvd devoted to views of the earth from the space shuttle. Too bad it didn't live up to my expectations. I was hoping for more of the type of views like the shots that you see on the cover of the dvd. What I got was mainly shots looking straight down at the ground so that much of the time you have a screen filled up with varying shades of brown with occasional views of a lake, river, or ocean. A few brief moments were good like the views of hurricanes from space but the good moments were very brief and very few in number. It just isn't that interesting.

I was also hoping for some night shots because all the lights shining up from the big cities would look kinda cool. Unfortunately there are NO night shots.

One good idea they had was that there are 4 different sound tracks to listen to with the video. That's the only good thing I can say about the dvd.

I was very disappointed with this dvd.",1153267200,26,988,4.082474226804123
8109146,5,B000EGDCI2,"I found myself not being able to take my eyes off of the screen while I was playing this. It's cool trying to figure out what part of the planet the shuttle is flying over. You can watch it with music or without, which is a neat choice to have.",1149552000,6,244,3.9
