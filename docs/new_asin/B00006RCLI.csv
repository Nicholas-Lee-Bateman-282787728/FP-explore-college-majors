7972404,3,B00006RCLI,"Released in1972, The Proud and the Damned tells the story of five ex-Confederate soldiers, led by Sgt. Will Hansen (Chuck Connors), trying to find a new home in South America after losing the war. A Napoleon-wannabe general (Andres Marquis) hires them to reconnoiter a village where the guys either party it up or romance local gals (Maria Grimm & Anita Quinn). Cesar Romero plays the mayor of the town while Jos&eacute; Greco & Nana Lorca are on hand as dancing gypsies. The rest of the ex-Confederates are played by Aron Kincaid, Smokey Roberds, Henry Capps and Peter Ford.

This is a low-budget and relatively obscure Western that doesnt get very good ratings, and I can understand why. Some of the acting is dubious and a few of the action sequences are less than convincing, not to mention theres zero build-up to the romance. Its overall a mediocre Western with some lambasting it as subpar or even unforgiveable trash, as one critic put it.

If you can overlook these flaws, however, there are several items that make the movie worth catching: Connors is a quality Western protagonist; the Columbian locations are scenic and authentic (say what you will, but quality locations cost money); the Latin-styled Western music by Gene Kauer & Douglas M. Lackey is quite good; this is a unique Western in that it takes place in South American (presumably Columbia); and the six protagonists are likable with good camaraderie. I say SIX because Im including the honorable Capt. Juan Hernandez, played by Conrad Parham.

I also like how unpredictable the movie is despite the predictability of the plot. In other words, just because you THINK you have the story figured out doesnt mean its necessarily the way its going to pan out. Also, despite the palpability of the low-budget I found myself involved in the story & the characters by the second half. Lastly, I cant help but respect the audacity of the unexpected and puzzling Climax.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Columbia.

7972405,1,B00006RCLI,The DVD was upseting to me. Chuck Connors is a great actor and this wasen't his best outing. I will keep buying more DVD's from AMAZON.,1398556800,,135,4.230769230769231
7972406,1,B00006RCLI,"I like Chuck Connors in most settings.  However, this was clearly a low budget movie.  The action was slow moving and the plot rather lame.  I would not recommend this movie even for die hard Chuck Connors fans.",1326844800,,211,4.5
7972407,2,B00006RCLI,"This movie is of poor visual, content, and story/plot quality. I love westerns but this one was very disappointing and a total waste of money.",1320710400,,142,4.72
7972408,5,B00006RCLI,"Timeless Media Group have done a fine job, considering the print they had to work with. I had previously purchased this film on a low rent VHS label over twenty years ago. That print was watchable but this one is much better. Chuck Connnors heads a solid cast including Aaron Kincaid, Peter Ford and veteran Cesar Romero in this tale of five Confederate veterans. Shaped by their Civil War experience, their only skills being mercenary, they head south of the border to ply their trade and soon find themselves engaged in a struggle between a military dictator and the people of a small village. Great music score adds to the film's atmosphere.",1208563200,13,644,4.758928571428571
7972409,1,B00006RCLI,"First of all, this video was released by Good Times of New York. They have been resurrecting television and B-Movie crap for years. I have a VHS copy of the spaghetti-western ""Captain Apache"" they released in 1985. The quality of the VHS Captain Apache was so terrible, it looked like a 5th-generation dub from a warped cassette. And the sound was horrible, alternately loud to barely audible, full of cracks and pops and weird reverb effects. It almost seemed as if they intentionally made the transfer as horrible as possible. I never bought another product from them after that.....until now....silly me.

Well, folks, unbelievably, after 20+ years of tricking customers into buying crap like the VHS Captain Apache, they are still at it! This DVD has a picture of a young Chuck Connors on the cover, yet the movie is from the end of his career when he had to make crap movies (Think Bela Lugosi in Ed Woods Plan 9 From Outer Space). This movie has scenes that look like they were made at Connors reading the script at home and mailed in to the Director and edited (crudely) into the scene. The quality of the transfer is the absolute worst. It's very bit as bad as the VHS Captain Apache tape from 1985. The good folks at Good Times do nothing to enhance or filter or digitally touch up these films. They look as if they do the exact opposite. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $4.99. This DVD isn't worth a plugged nickel. Horrible Crap!",1206057600,3,1426,4.5703125
7972410,1,B00006RCLI,"If there was a ZERO to pick from above, that would be to kind for this movie! I only bought it because I am a Chuck Connors fan and he was killed half way through the movie.  It was one of the worst movies I now have in my collection.  To bad I couldn't have rented it first to watch, but I think the rental places are way to smart to do that!!!!  The quality is horrible and the acting from EVERYONE is the worst ever!!!  Do not buy this movie!!!",1202428800,,447,3.879120879120879

7972412,3,B00006RCLI,"The Proud and the Damned is an entertaining western that is worth a watch because the DVD is so cheap.  In 1870 in an unidentified South American country, five Confederate mercenaries are hired by a corrupt, evil dictator, General Martinez to do a job.  The five men must find the hideout of the revolutionaries fighting Martinez and how many men he is up against.  As it goes, the mercenaries are captured by the revolutionaries.  They must then decide whether to side with the rebels and face Martinez or try and escape and keep their deal with the general.  This is one of those movies that you just don't know why you like it.  The script is nothing to brag about, the action scenes are a little cheesy, and the quality of the movie is poor, yet even with all these reasons, I still enjoyed this movie.  Go figure.  I recommend this movie because it is so cheap, and it is an entertaining way to kill an hour and a half.

  Chuck Connors plays Sergeant Will Hansen, the leader of the close knit group of Confederate mercenaries who find themselves in a sticky situation.  Connors is very good as a sort of father figure to his men.  Aron Kincaid plays Ike, one of the mercenaries who falls in love with a woman promised to another man.  Cesar Romero plays the leader of the revolutionaries in San Carlos opposing General Martinez, played by Andres Marquis.  The remaining mercenaries are played by Smokey Roberds as Jeb, Henry Capps as Hank, and Peter Ford as Billy.  The rest of the cast includes Jose Greco, Conrad Parham, Maria Grimm, Nana Lorca, and Anita Quinn.  The DVD offers the movie in standard presentation with no extra features.  The movie is not in the best of condition, but what do you want from a DVD that costs under $5?  For an enjoyable western with Chuck Connors and some south of the border excitement, check out The Proud and the Damned!",1090800000,10,1864,4.543543543543543
