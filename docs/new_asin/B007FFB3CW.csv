8558082,5,B007FFB3CW,"I just started pole dancing and the instructor I went to was really hard to follow, she was all over the place. So I bought a pole for home and needed some DVD's for training. This is absolutely the best DVD there is. The instructor takes her time going over each move numerous times and then at the end of each session, she will put some of the moves together to make a small routine. There are 4 DVD's from beginners to advanced, they are pretty lengthy and broken down into sections. I would highly recommend this DVD. On Amazon they state it is unavailable at the present time, I found mine on Ebay (new). I can't think of all the amazing words to describe this DVD, do not hestiate to buy it. I am positive that you will not be disappointed.

p.s. I bought another DVD from a different instructor at the same time I purchased this one. I was so dissatisified with the other DVD.

So please, please buy this one and give it a try!",1346803200,3,934,4.241573033707865
