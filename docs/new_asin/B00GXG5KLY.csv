6123676,4,B00GXG5KLY,"Very good movie, I gave 4 stars because there is no English translation, instead English subtitles. It is hard to cope up to the story and cinematic when at the same time you are watching and reading. You must be a chameleon in order to this with pleasure.",1397088000,4,256,4.354166666666667

6123679,5,B00GXG5KLY,"It's unusual to see a South Korean film incorporate to this extent North Korean criminal activities in the south. A politically sensitive area of northern spies assassinating residents of the south. Another example of South Korea's studios excelling in storytelling, acting, filming and sets.",1395273600,,292,5.659090909090909
6123680,4,B00GXG5KLY,"Commitment is about the son of a North Korean spy who decides to follow in his fathers footsteps in order to protect his little sister. After his fathers botched espionage mission, Myung-hoon (Choi Seung-hyun) and his sister are sent to a labor prison camp. To save his sisters life, Myung-hoon volunteers to become a spy and infiltrates the South as a teenage defector.

While attending high school in the South, he meets a pretty girl named Hye-in (Kim Yoo-jeong), an aspiring dancer, and rescues her when she is attacked. South Korean Intelligence soon discovers the plot and begins closing in on Myung-hoon while his own government sends a vicious assassin to eliminate him. Action dominates this fast-paced melodrama with car chases, explosions, and expertly choreographed fight sequences.

Myung-hoon uses his martial arts skills to confront school bullies and in his capacity as a spy. Choi Seung-hyun is a pop superstar, heading one of Koreas biggest groups, Big Bang. Its interesting to see this sweet-faced guy playing a professional killer. The movie portrays high school as a place where discipline is lax and gangs intimidate both students and teachers.

The film is in Korean, with English subtitles. Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette and theatrical trailer.",1395187200,9,1307,5.244019138755981
6123681,4,B00GXG5KLY,"I am a HUGE, stalker-like fan of  the Korean actor, rapper Choi Seung Hyun (TOP). I've followed his career and thought he had a lot of potential, however, headlining a movie is a different animal. He did not disappoint. This is an action-packed movie. I won't give any spoilers away, but I will say it is very violent (like gunshots, stab wounds, lots of blood, violent), but if you love action movies, this is a great one.",1395100800,,423,4.4935064935064934
6123682,5,B00GXG5KLY,I enjoyed every second of this movie. Choi Seung Hyun (TOP) is amazing in this. Lots of action and a great story of a brother fighting to get his sister back.,1390867200,11,158,4.129032258064516
6123683,3,B00GXG5KLY,Very well done.  It kept you  guessing.,1473379200,,39,4.428571428571429
6123684,3,B00GXG5KLY,"North Korean siblings are locked in a youth detention system told that their father is a traitor who defected to the South.  In reality, the father was working as a covert agent and is killed at the beginning of the film rather than let himself be captured.  The North Korean authorities pull the same trick with the male sibling, who is supposed to be around nineteen--if he goes to the South and pretends to be a defector, working for them as a covert agent, then his sister will be safe.

We never see any of the lead character's training or find out how he managed to become the Korean equivalent of Jason Bourne, but that's only one of the problems with Commitment, which never quite figures out how to make anything that happens very believable, even within the heightened reality of an action picture.

Our hero is sent to school so he can maintain his cover--where he encounters brutal bullying and falls for a female classmate who is a victim of said bullies.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going to happen to those bullies but this section turns out to be by far the least entertaining part of the film.  From a narrative perspective, the only real purpose of these scenes is to try and make the lead character more likable and humanize him by giving him someone to care about other than the abstract sister that we almost never see.

Unfortunately, it doesn't really work.  The film doesn't seem enough interested in the human element of its story to invest much time or emotion in it.  I suppose on a certain level that can be forgiven since Commitment is an action picture, not a love story or relationship drama.  But the action scenes basically involve two different covert North Korean spy sections operating in South Korea, with the members killing each other off because they are part of a power struggle in North Korea before Kim Jong-un assumes power.  Under the circumstances, it's hard to care about either side or who lives or dies since the characters are basically a bunch of political pawns killing each other off for reasons they don't seem to know or care about.  Everyone is just blindly following orders, killing each other even though they are all fiercely loyal to the same homeland.

Under the circumstances, Commitment would have been better served by showing more interest in the human side of its protagonist, who kills with the efficiency and conscience of a cyborg from The Terminator series and is largely a cipher in the non-action scenes.  In a curious dramatic choice, the hero never finds out the truth about his father even though a sympathetic character is introduced who knows.  Wouldn't finding out that his father was used the same way he is being used be worth a few moments of screen time?

Commitment's action sequences are crisp, exciting and well-staged--and if that's all you're looking for then this movie might be sufficiently entertaining.  But the lack of dramatic grounding for the action ultimately limits its effectiveness.  There's really nobody to root for or care about so it feels like nothing is at stake.

I am a pretty big fan of Korean thrillers and action pictures but for me, at least, Commitment was average at best.  It certainly isn't boring, but it lacks the moving human element of A Bittersweet Life, the cliffhanger thrills of Midnight FM, the crazy plot twists of Confession of Murder or the flat-out over-the-top crazy of Killers or I Saw the Devil.  So many exceptional genre films are coming out of Korea these days that's it's kind of disappointing to encounter something as middling as Commitment.  But if you are just looking for an action movie fix, you could really do a lot worse.",1471996800,,3684,4.732394366197183

6123687,5,B00GXG5KLY,I finally broke down and bought this movie after watching it at least 3 times. Such a good movie!! T.O.P plays the part perfectly and you'll be engrossed throughout the whole thing. English subtitles are available and the quality is fantastic. Worth every penny.,1467504000,,262,4.9772727272727275

6123693,4,B00GXG5KLY,THE k pop star Tops Of  Musical group Big Bang... is the  Action hero is this one. Its a tragic story of a son of a North Korean spy who's  father is murdered before he is able to return from a mission in the south. TOPS or Choi Syung Hyun  is his 18 year old son  and along with his sister who are now in a labor camp because they consider them children of a traitor.  They call Tops out jail  to be a spy like his dad in order to save himself and his  younger sister.  TOPS is sent to the south as a high school student awaiting his assignment which is to kill a rouge agent that murdering other assigned agents. This is a good flick  it filled with action ....its not a teen flick although hes in high school  it a tear jerker at the end folks so have tissue ready ...  Tops or Chio Syung Hyun is extremely compelling and fierce in the action scenes .  He  finally realizes hes just a pawn being used but hes just a teenager who loves his baby sis and will do anything to protect her. Good movie I could watch it over and over.,1441497600,,1030,3.9609756097560975
6123694,5,B00GXG5KLY,Loved this movie. Excellent plot and development. Choi Seunghyun is a great up and coming actor!,1438214400,,96,5.0625
6123695,5,B00GXG5KLY,"T.O.P may be a kpop rapper boybander, but he seems to actually be able to act in a subdued, intense sort of way. Some reviews may call him wooden, but I guess I just prefer the restrained acting choices he has made for this character. Some great action sequences in the beginning that are made more believable because you can feel how he's just a young guy struggling really hard to survive against older and more experienced men. Some interesting hints of politics with how the South Korean police choose to respond to the politics of the North Korean changeover of leadership, but they keep it really light instead of delving in deeper, because this movie is all about T.O.P awkwardly trying to navigate his fake high school life (complete with reluctant almost-but-not-quite romance) by day while killing people at night.  My only issue is the ending -- since this is a Korean movie, I had already prepared myself for the expected tearjerker ending, but it was completely unnecessary and I could feel them trying to manipulate my emotions a mile away. But it was pretty satisfying all the way up to those last few minutes, which is good enough for me! Great comfort-watching movie, highly recommended. :)",1436572800,2,1207,4.802884615384615

6123699,5,B00GXG5KLY,All I can say about this movie is that T.O.P (Choi Seung-hyun from the Kpop group Big Bang) acting was was purely amazing. The plot was amazing in itself but the acting was just...so we'll done. It kept me interested until the end!!!,1427846400,,233,4.441860465116279

6123701,5,B00GXG5KLY,"I'm familiar with Choi Seung-hyun (TOP) from his solo music as well as his works with the K-Pop group Big Bang, so when I heard he had done a movie, I had to see it. I found it on YouTube, and I've currently watched half, and I can tell you this...it is ACTION PACKED! Top gives me very fluid movement in his fight scenes, and his acting is pretty good. I'm going to finish watching on YouTube, but this movie will most certainly become apart of my collection.",1425081600,,460,4.238636363636363
6123702,5,B00GXG5KLY,"Another terrific Korean action movie. Neck and neck with the Japanese and Chinese for action movies. Why can't we do this well. A north Korean father never gets back after spying on the south, the north has his son and daughter imprisoned as the children of a traitor. they let them out under the condition that the older, 18 year old boy, become a spy. he does and well lots of backs get stabbed, lots of fighting, lots of intrigue and through it all is Choi Seung-hyun, this kid is remarkable.

6123718,3,B00GXG5KLY,"I thought the acting and action in this film were pretty good, but I was overall disappointed with it.  The story line seemed to devolve half way through and it never managed to get itself together.  Unfortunately, at the end I felt rather unmoved.  I wanted to enjoy it so much more, but was left hoping for something more.  I am being very vague so that I'm not spoiling anything.",1405641600,4,382,4.414285714285715

6123724,5,B00GXG5KLY,"Well first off, you will not be disappointed in buying this movie.  It's a simple DVD, the packaging is nothing fancy so don't expect a lot when it comes to this...after all it's not a Big Bang CD release.

Casting T.O.P in this movie was a huge plus for the director/producers...because those that are fangirls of this prince-like idol will be to busy swooning over his every move in this film to notice that unrealisticness of the plot.  If you don't mind the film saying that North Korean defectors are able to gain access to South Korea like I could sneak out of my parents house with their car when I was a teenager is unbelievable...seeing as how both countries are always on the fringes of war.  So this director/screen writer have the main character gain access to this country without any hardships and then get adopted by a family that doesn't mind a 19 year old kid....who poses as a high school student during the day/night and a killer for North Korea whenever he gets the call (Spolier Alert...Sorry).

The action in this movie is awesome. I'm giving it 5-stars because the main actor is....well google him (he's beautiful). T.O.P gives a very sensitive, compassionate and thrilling performance.  There really aren't very many lines in this drama but it still manages to flow well....The character, is forced to be a spy after the death of his father who was also a spy (spoiler alert) in order to save himself and his sister....and while doing so, he finds time to adopt and save a young girl whose his classmate.

It's a beautiful yet tragic tale....again you want be disappointed.",1402876800,,1597,4.702508960573477

6123726,5,B00GXG5KLY,"This movie is so sad and emotional. For fans of Choi Seunghyun (T.O.P of BIGBANG), I think this movie is an excellent way to get a glimpse of our idol's ability as an actor. His performance is heartbreaking and it might even bring a tear to your eye. For anyone interested in foreign film or the conflict on the Korean peninsula, this movie is a drama about a North Korean youth who is sent to South Korea and forced to work as a spy as punishment for his father's wrongdoings. It takes a sensationalized look at the conflict but it may also inspire you to learn more about the situation of the people living in North Korea who are sentenced to three-generation sentences in prison camps and forced to do labor or work as disposable spies.
While it isn't the most excellent movie I've seen, I'm rating it five-stars because the performance given by T.O.P is wonderful and the movie moved me emotionally. I truly enjoyed watching it, even if it was a heartbreaking story.",1402617600,,970,4.548571428571429

6123732,4,B00GXG5KLY,"The original Korean title for this one is something like ""The Alumnus,"" which refers to the hero's double status, as both a teenager in a South Korean high school, and as a graduate of North Korean spy training. So the film is a bit of an odd hybrid, partly a teen high-school K-drama, and partly a crime-cum-spy thriller. The surprise is that it works reasonably well, except for the last act, where the principals act according the harsh rules of romantic melodrama, rather than as they would in the real world. Only in the movies, after all, will someone who's been shot be transported in a private car, with the girlfriend hanging on to him and weeping, rather than in an ambulance, with paramedics. And only in the movies will a detective, acting on a tip, arrive at a gun-filled showdown alone rather than having called the location in to the local gumshoes to get some backup. But, what the heck, it's the movies.

That said, this is a well-made thriller, with some good acting from its newly minted star (K-pop idol T.O.P., Choi Seung Hyun), a crackling pace, and some decent action set-pieces. Going into the film you should know, however, that the girl on the cover is his sister, and she has only a tiny tiny role in the proceedings. You also need to know that, according to the film anyway, North and South have meetings (in Beijing naturally, neutral territory for both) at which information is sometimes exchanged. Is this true? I have no idea, but suspect that it might be, as they say, based on truth. It certainly is true that the North runs drugs and other illegal products in order to benefit its elites, and that is reflected to a degree in the film, which shows the North's  spy appartus in the South as basically a criminal gang, rather than politically motivated. A not bad film, overall, so long as you don't expect anything more than a fairly decent crime film; good for what it is, but it isn't anything more.",1398297600,,1935,4.589595375722543
