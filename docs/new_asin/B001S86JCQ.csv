I have many (nearly all) of Leslie's videos and Dvd's and this one is my least favorite.  It doesn't make me want to workout.",1244419200,5,266,4.844444444444444
3785300,5,B001S86JCQ,I love this video!  It goes by so fast and the interval training is the latest thing which is supposed to really bump up the fat burning.  It really gets my heart rate up and I feel so good when I am  finished.  The music is motivational and the steps are easy to follow.  My current favorite!,1244246400,3,293,4.0701754385964914
3785301,4,B001S86JCQ,"I just purchased this DVD and really like it.  Here is why.

1.  The music is better than a lot of Leslie's DVD's.
2.  The ability not to listen to her run her mouth is priceless.
3.  The boosted walk in a DVD of this length.
4.  The eye candy.

This DVD is just long and brish enough to get my heart rate up when I'm running short of time.",1244246400,3,340,3.7714285714285714
3785302,5,B001S86JCQ,"The ladies at my work and I walk to Leslie DVDs each day at lunch.  Our favorites are:

This one also incorporates a two-minute ""Boosted Walk"" at the end of each mile.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-5-Day-Slim-Down/dp/B001AYWY5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: 5 Day Slim Down</a>&nbsp;because we can pick which of the two-mile workouts we want to walk to (one of which uses hand weights), again giving us variety.

But this one quickly became a favorite too.  It does lack the mile markers and use of any extra equipment but it gives you a nice, but not too hard, work out.  We definitely sweat.  Leslie is off on some of her cues, but that seems to be the case with her other DVDs too.  Also, with this one you only really have one option, and that is to do this exact two-mile walk, whereas with her other DVDs you can mix it up each day so it won't be so repetitive.

If you have other Leslie DVDs and enjoy doing her walks, then this will be a great addition to your collection.  Midway through this two-mile workout she incorporates three sets of two-minute ""Boosted Walking"" (jogging with kicks and knee lifts mixed in).  This added interval training will get your heartbeat up there and make you sweat if you weren't already.  The jogging and such is manageable because each boost is only two minutes long.

We love walking with Leslie.  If you are looking for a way of exercising that will get you results without pushing you to the limit, you will find that with Leslie's DVDs.  (Note:  Due to the ""Boosted Walking"" in this one, it might not be for beginners.)",1244160000,37,2043,5.198776758409786
3785303,2,B001S86JCQ,"I am a fan of Leslie.  I have highly recommended her to many of my friends.  She is great, but this is not one of her best.  I was eagerly waiting for it to come out.  It is a very bad production.  The camara is always moving.  It looks like a home production.  The good thing it is very short and I use it when I don't have too much time.",1243987200,9,339,3.6901408450704225
3785304,5,B001S86JCQ,"I have been doing the WATP dvd's for almost a year.  This DVD makes it way right to the top of my list in rotation.
Let's list the PROS of this DVD:
1.  Music only option (for those of us who are veterans to the WATP series and can follow the steps without instruction)
2.  New music to follow
3.  The BOOSTED/JOGGING intervals are EXCELLENT.  They aren't just at the end of the DVD or miles.  It starts about 8 minutes in and lasts for about 12 minutes.  That's 12 minutes (thereabouts) of BOOSTED/JOGGING.  It's alternated between kicks, knee lifts, and jogging up and back.
4.  Fast paced, doesn't take 30 minutes to break a really good sweat.  You should sweat through the entire DVD.
5.  If you are looking for an excellent DVD to repeat (back to back play), this gives an excellent middle of the week or weekend buster to the same old workout.
6.  Same great arm, leg, and (dare I say it) aerobic workout!

Now let's list the CONS:
1.  Leslie has a couple of spots where she is off on her sequences.  But hey, noones perfect and after watching this JUST ONCE, put it on music only--you can do it without her telling you what to do and it makes it simpler.
2.  Could be longer.  Yeah, yeah...I am glutton for punishment, but I would LOVE to have an interval training DVD that did the JOGGING/BOOSTED WALKING for more than 33 minutes.  But in a pinch it's a GREAT workout.

That's it!  I strongly recommend this particular DVD for anyone who is looking to add a little something extra to their standard workout.  It's just extreme enough to make a difference in the overall performance of workouts and easy enough to do everyday if that's what you choose.
Well that's enough for me, time to use this DVD again!
Happy walking ;-)

3785305,5,B001S86JCQ,"I have several of Leslie's workout programs and what makes this one special is that it has a music only feature for those who are tired of all the chatter. You can do the workout with or without the instructions and talking Leslie does. Even though the DVD is only 35 minutes long, if you just run it through with verbal instruction and music only it is like 70 minutes. I hope there are more like this one in the future.",1243296000,9,421,4.209876543209877

3785307,5,B001S86JCQ,"This is 1 of my favorite WATP .  I love it because the boosts in the walk-jog are brief  (90 seconds or 1.5 min each) enough that I don't get mad and stop.  Plus, I do it to keep my heart healthy.  The only thing I didn't like when I bought it over 4 years ago, was it made it seem like it was 2 separate workouts and you could choose to do a 1-mile or a 2-mile.  However, the one 33 minute about 2 1/4 mile walk is great and I've done it so much that I have it memorized.  Like someone else said, Steve (the teacher) is cute, but don't watch him too much because he messes up and might cause you to mess up.  Good group of walkers.",1384387200,,632,3.7786259541984735

3785312,5,B001S86JCQ,I don't mind that Leslie jibber jabbers all through the exercise. I need a drill sargeant.  I like her constant encouragement and same old jokes she has used on previous tapes.  I like her personality.  I feel i get a good 30 minute work out.,1358553600,,242,4.333333333333333

3785314,2,B001S86JCQ,"Many of youwho have LS's tapes know she can make some mistakes and it's sort of cute. THIS IS ONE SADLY PRODUCED AND EDITED Tape.
First off the Camera moves erratically twice in the video and makes you dizzy.
Then I got all excited because finally there was an attractive man in the group. Oh well proving again looks aren't everything.
First off this guy i choreographically challenged and when it Leslie says tap out he does side steps!
Then when they do their ""walk up 4 and back 4"" he gets caught in front of a platform and can't move anywhere. Tjis really throws him for a loop. GEEZ!
Also not that I don't respect how difficult maintaining weight can be but I almost didn't recognize MARY KAY!. Peraps she had some health issues but she looks much older and has put on weight. If anybody knows about this please comment. I hope she is ok.
This video is really not good. A better choice would be any of the others that have boosted walking and do the 2 mile section.",1336089600,3,971,4.34065934065934
3785315,5,B001S86JCQ,I am a Leslie Sansone video junkie and this one doesn't disappoint !!

3785316,4,B001S86JCQ,"Likes:
  Music only option--I really like this, as I find her chatter annoying.
  Simple steps; her usual ones, not requiring too much concentration on steps
  Variety using the intervals
Dislikes:
  Need printed, on-the-screen lead in to step changes
  Somewhat rough transition between intervals, especially after the 3rd interval
  Can do without the ""whoop, whoop, whoop"" annoying noises in the cool down
  Stretch seems rushed.
Overall, I believe this one helped me avoid weight gain during the holidays.",1325808000,,509,5.441558441558442
3785317,5,B001S86JCQ,"This may become one of my favorite Leslie workouts.  It goes by so fast it didn't feel like 2+ miles.  I ordered it because it's one of the few that offers the ""music only"" option.  That turned out to be a double advantage because the music is hard to hear in the voice version.  With music only you can turn the volume way up and hear the music.  There are also some hiccups in the music but if you're a Leslie fan it doesn't interfere with your workout.  Another good music only tape is ""3 miles Slim & Sleek plus Pilates.""  I don't do the Pilates - the 3 miles meets my needs.
  ""The Big Burn"" is a great tape for those days when you're pushed for time and need an intense quick 30 minute workout..",1325376000,,701,4.095588235294118
3785318,4,B001S86JCQ,"I like this DVD because the 2 miles go by quickly and and I relly feel like I've had a workout. I also like the fact that it can be done to music only. When you listen to these tapes day after day you get to know what she will say next, and then I get bored.",1320364800,,258,3.543859649122807
3785319,4,B001S86JCQ,"This one surprised me and I wish I had known about this one sooner because it would have saved me from buying some of the other ones.

Leslie is still a chatterbox on this one and misses a few cues because of it. There's also a point where Leslie tells the camera man to follow her while she messes with him to do some kicks. He actually does a couple while he's holding the camera up which is the crazier thing about it.

Also, there are no mile markers. You go straight through and Leslie doesn't even announce the mileage until you're at the end of the stretch and she tells you that you've (obviously) done two miles. On the up-side, the workout goes by so quickly that you don't really notice it.

The main down side is that you only go through the intervals 3 times. Leslie is never clear if the running intervals are 90 seconds or 2 minutes. She tried to make it seem like they are the same but 90 seconds is not 2 minutes (obviously). It kind of made me wish it was a 3 mile program so you could get at least 5 intervals out of it.

Anyway, this a good workout for when you don't have time but still want to do something to get your heart pumping.",1319760000,,1155,4.12
3785320,5,B001S86JCQ,"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan, as I am not coordinated enough for step aerobics and like being able to work all muscles at once. I used several of her more basic videos during my pregnancy and soon after delivery. This DVD is by far one of my favorites, it offers the most difficult workout of any of her DVDs that i have tried. I am a runner and use these dvds on rainy days or when I'm not in the mood for a run. I increase the difficulty of all her DVDs by adding 2-3lb hand weights and 3lb leg weights. It's certainly a workout!",1316044800,,533,3.9906542056074765
3785321,5,B001S86JCQ,"Don't let the production quality of this DVD scare you. It's not a problem (you're doing this for exercise, right? not to watch a DVD!), and the workout is great. This is a good routine to move to if you've done the basic Walk Away 1-2-3 milers already (the ones with the 2 lb weights). Currently I alternate between the WATP 3 mile, which I shorten to about 2 miles (30 minutes) and the Big Burn. That way I do a half hour workout 3 times a week, about the limit of my tolerance for exercise. I shorten the 3-mile WATP by doing the warm up then skipping to the middle to do the second half with the weights.

My advice is to listen carefully to what Leslie says: tummy tuck always, lift the feet high and kick high when she says to do so. It makes the workout a bit harder, but you will see results faster.  I needed to flatten my belly, but I had to give up on her ShortCuts Abs video because the curls and crunches were hurting my neck (and it wasn't much fun either). But it turns out there's another way: if you pull that belly button in ALWAYS during these aerobic workouts, as she says repeatedly in the Big Burn, you get an abs workout as well. My stomach is flattening now, so it works.  I'm not as convinced about the results of the triceps exercise in 3-mile WATP, but then it's pretty short. Maybe I need to do more of those (they're nasty, though, so maybe not...)

The cellulite, yes and even dimples in my hips/thighs that I used to have?  Gone. After only a few months of WATP. Adding Big Burn is helping to keep it off.

One more word of advice: especially for the Big Burn, in humid weather, set your AC to 70 degrees or less if you can. You will still sweat, but much less than if your body is encased in humidity. Keep in mind that you drip with sweat when the air is already too full of water to accept any more from you; the AC will dry out the air so your sweat can evaporate - much more comfortable.

Think you're too old to do these exercises? I'm 66. Have fun and feel good about yourself!",1315094400,3,2015,4.138107416879795
3785322,5,B001S86JCQ,"This is a great way to lose weight and firm up! This is not just a walking DVD...it is so much more. Leslie ""walks"" you through a total body workout using aerobics and boosted walking (jogging)! I love that it doesn't matter if it is raining or too hot/cold outdoors, I can still get in my daily exercise, get energized and lose weight. I am 60yrs old and the option of using low and/or high impact, while still getting a good workout, is an added plus.",1308268800,,453,4.27906976744186
3785323,5,B001S86JCQ,"I have most of the Leslie series. This one is perfect for when I only have half an hour. It's upbeat, fast and get's your heart rate up. Like every Leslie video, it has a few blips and Leslie missing the cues, but it just shows no one is perfect:)",1307491200,,247,3.96
3785324,2,B001S86JCQ,Have several other of her walking DVD's and love them.  I cannot hear her talking on this one when you choose that version.,1307145600,,123,4.3478260869565215
3785325,4,B001S86JCQ,"I own several of Leslie's videos and I love them all. They are good workouts that you can do in 15, 20 or 30 minutes if you don't have a lot of time, and there are longer ones as well for days when you have time to do more. This one is no exception and I like the ""boosted"" intervals, which are basically light jogging in place. Don't let that scare you, if I can jog for one minute, so can you!!

However, I must agree with other reviewers who commented on the poor production quality. As the video starts, the camera is shaking pretty badly. A couple of times,  you can see a cameraman lying on the floor filming the walker's feet. There are also quick cuts to things like signs on the wall or a rack of stability balls that come out of nowhere and kind of make your head spin. It looks like they shot this in one take and didn't feel like editing it. I know these videos aren't expensive and that's part of the appeal, but it feels like they just didn't care about quality at all. I took off one star for bad production quality.",1306886400,5,1031,4.124378109452737
3785326,5,B001S86JCQ,"I own several of Leslie's videos, and this one is my FAVORITE! I love the fast pace and the way these intervals are done. Like another reviewer said, the boost isn't just at the end of each mile, they are mixed right in with the workout. Love the group of walkers too! The only thing I would change about this video is to make it more than 2 miles. Many times I do this one back to back! Another bonus is that the video starts right away without the usual ""check with your doctor, etc"" screens. Also, if you add weighted gloves to it, you'll get a great workout for your upper body as well! Definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a good boosted walk!! Leslie - PLEASE make another like this with 4 or 5 miles of intervals!! :)",1306800000,4,739,4.211267605633803

3785328,4,B001S86JCQ,"When you don't have the time and you need to sweat, this works just fine.  Obviously not as long as Leslie's 3,4 and 5 mile workouts, this fits in the ""I really need a good workout, but I just don't have the time"".  These 30 minutes raise your heart rate and set you sweating, so leave time for a quick shower afterwards.

Four stars instead of 5 because the music only version is recorded so low that I needed to push my volume to max to hear it.  This is compared to her ""3 Fast Miles"" where volume is at about a 7 out of 50, this one is 50 out of 50.",1305763200,,553,3.8672566371681416

When it first started I was skeptical-afraid it was the same as all the others as the warm up does mirror many of her other workouts.  When it did get to the 'boosted' part of this workout, i was impressed.  Though you know the basic four moves, the adjustments in this DVD really did take it to the next level and keep your heart rate up.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was because it is only a 30 minute workout.

3785341,4,B001S86JCQ,"I love Leslie Sansone's workouts because she got me through my exercise block and now I'm exercising routinely.  On days when I'm walking 2 miles, I like to maximize the impact and I can do that with this workout.  This is pretty classic Leslie, walking with a group.  The intensity is added with intervals of ""boosted"" walking, which is slow jogging in place with added kicks and knee raises.  These intervals are short, 90 seconds to 2 minutes, but really add a nice level of intensity.  The rest of the walk consists of Leslie's signature 4 moves.  The set is at her studio with the black background, but there is a window that you can see out of and watch a little of what is going on outside.  I like this workout because I feel that I'm getting a little extra in 30 minutes of exercise!",1284595200,2,792,4.383561643835616
3785342,4,B001S86JCQ,I love Leslie's DVDs. I do alot of the walking with weights. This one is great because it is short and sweet. It is about 30 mins long but I get my heart-rate up and sweat to prove it. Sometimes I get bored/tired with the three mile walks.

3785346,5,B001S86JCQ,"I have been doing Leslie Sansone workouts for about 6 months and I love everything she's done.  I hate working out and have never found anything I like enough to stick with for longer than a month, but I think Leslie has finally given me a workout I love!  I've been doing her basic 2 mile workout for a long while now, but I was still a little worried about trying The Big Burn because I was afraid it would be too hard.  I shouldn't have worried because, while it was challenging, it was still the same basic moves I've come to know and love!  I definitely broke a sweat, and continued to sweat for at least 5 minutes after the DVD was over.  Plus, this workout went by (as Leslie says) ""in a snap""!  Truly, it was over before I knew it.  I'm so excited to add this DVD to my weekly Leslie routine!",1275350400,,800,4.122580645161291
3785347,5,B001S86JCQ,"This is a great workout for when you only have around 30 minutes in your day to get active.  Leslie incorporates the boosted walking into this time frame so it really helps get you sweating!  As with all of her videos, the steps are easy and even though there are a few technical glitches (her microphone gets in the way) I enjoy her enthusiasm and the way she converses with the other walkers!",1271980800,,394,4.383561643835616
3785348,4,B001S86JCQ,"Interval training and circuit training are the best and quickest ways to fitness and weight loss, according to scientists and people in the medical community. This is a good video. I enjoy most all of Leslie's workouts --- even though many are pretty much the same. If you own six of them, you pretty much own them all. Having said that, she doesn't do interval training on many of them --- certainly not her earlier ones. Probably because interval training is fairly new to many people. I hope she uses this type of training in all of her future videos. Debbie Rocker does and I really get a lot out of her walks.

On the bad side, I like the one mile walks and I can't really get this one to work for me. If I start on mile two it begins with no warm up but does have a cooldown. If I start on mile one, it has a warm-up but no cooldown. She claims you can choose to do one or two miles. But, in reality, it doesn't work.

Leslie seems to take lots of shortcuts in her videos lately and it's at the expense of providing good options to her fans. But for those who enjoy the two miles, this is a whale of a workout and you'll burn a ton of calories. No doubt about that. One of her best. Moreover, the studio looks nice and Leslie looks especially good in this video. She seems to have lost weight and looks better than when she was younger.

Highly recommended.

At first, I thought that maybe I wasted my money.  In reality, it is a good workout in that most of the workout is fast paced with the addition of the boosted walking.  So if you own the 5 mile, just picture the faster pace of the second part of each mile coupled with boosted walking as your ENTIRE workout.  The workout is 33 miles in length and that includes about a 2 mile cooldown.",1269734400,,524,4.098039215686274

I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and I was so very disappointed.  Unlike many of her other videos, Leslie and her friends are all over the place!  The other walkers were continually making adjustments to try to keep up with Leslie and she does not give you heads up before she goes into a new move.  It was so frustrating that I have not used it since. Beware. :)",1267056000,4,481,4.252747252747253
3785353,5,B001S86JCQ,"I really love the 2-Mile Big Burn when I'm in a hurry! My husband & I have so many of Leslie's walk at home DVD's. Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week. We wouldn't trade her for the world!",1264464000,2,843,4.275
3785354,5,B001S86JCQ,"If it's one of those days where you feel like getting going a little faster, this tape has a good walk with some short boosted sections. In this DVD, ""intervals"" means high-impact aerobics, not standing exercises, something which isn't always clear. This one's got a group of the usual suspects (nice to see you again, girls!), and Leslie is very perky, which some of us like and some of us don't. The production values are fairly good, although I think I hear some microphone glitches. The music is motivating enough. I'd recommend this one for those days when you need to get moving and feel up to some serious jumping around.",1262131200,,628,4.666666666666667
3785355,4,B001S86JCQ,"Ok, like many ppl who have left reviews, I too, am a Leslie Sansone fan. I enjoy her DVDs for the Basic movements as there isn't much to think about in way of choreography, therefore I can really focus on my intensity. I have had this DVD for a while and I popped it in today after not doing her interval workouts in quite some time. If I could rate this DVD, I would give it 4.5 Stars...here's why:

Cons (Let's get them out of the way to focus on the good!):
* She does hit her mic several times throughout the workout so you here that banging
* The music is a little lower, but I believe there is a ""music only"" option...I could be wrong here

Semi-Con (this doesn't bother me...it may for some)
* She has the camera guy follow her so she can instruct another crew member to do some kicks. I thought it was cute; some may not.

Pros:
* 2 Miles with 3 Intervals approx 90 seconds to 2 minutes per interval
* Unlike Walk Slim were Steve was the object of some teasing...it's pretty light here and not distracting at all
* Steve and Jo Anne modify the High Impact while Leslie and the rest do the High Impact
* The Intervals and walking are NOT discombobulated. Some ppl have said they seem like they are all over the place; I do not feel that they are. I hate motions and patterns that feel that way, this does not.
* Steady cool down and stretch; some other DVDs of her's seem to have a very short cool down and some offer no stretch.

I really did like this workout. After I finished it today I had the energy to do another 2 Miles from a moderate paced walk of hers. If you have the Walk Slim Series, it's similar to her 2 Fast Miles, but I personally enjoy this one the best of the 2; the set is brighter in her studio for Big Burn vs Darker in Walk Slim (both shot at the same location). Unlike 4 Fast Miles which has 5 Intervals, this has 3 so it's shorter in length and duration; perfect for gaining endurance for walks like 4 Fast Miles and 4 Really Big Miles...even 3 Weight Loss Miles which was released a few years back (another Must-Have!!).

This DVD kept my Heart Rate soaring and I was really surprized at just how high. I have been conditioned a long time so higher heart rates tend to not feel as high for some reason; a good thing I suppose. When I check my HRM (Polar F6) it read that my average HR was 140 and my Max was 172! I really had the energy today and put my all into this workout. If you do the same, you can get some pretty impressive numbers. For the 4 total miles I did (Big Burn and a Classic Walk) I logged 542 calories burned in 60 minutes. I find that impressive for a Leslie Sansone 60 minute workout!! That's more than I burned doing the same intensity of Step Aerobics!!

Aside from the few ""cons"", I like this DVD and would recommend it to anyone. Be prepared to sweat and huff and puff!!! If You don't then I think it's time for a more challenging instructor!",1261526400,2,2901,4.125663716814159

Some of her newer ones haven't been for me, especially the ones where it's just her because I enjoy the group setting.  But this one had a great mix of people and it was fun.  I hadn't seen the guy in it before, he's a friendly upbeat hunk and I enjoyed watching him...more of him please.  Yes, she misses her cues a couple times, yes the mike makes a noise when it gets hit a couple times...all that stuff is what made it fun for me.  Part of what I like about her so much is that she isn't polished and she is goofy.  There is none of this faked voice ""and a one and a two"" type stuff that is in too many other workout videos. It makes working out with her fun and gets me laughing sometimes.  I'd say the difficulty level on this one on a scale of 1 to 10 would be about a 6 if you do it just like she is.  But you can knock it down or bump it up a few levels according to where you are at.  That is what I did.  I added one more jogging interval while they were doing slower moves because I was in the mood for a little more.  On a day I don't have the energy, I can lower it down some.  There is a music only option if you are someone that doesn't like to hear Leslie's chatter (I do). The only con for me is there isn't any marker that tells you how far along you are.

Large cast, coordinated clothes, good music, upbeat spirit. Easy to follow. And Joann does it all LOW with no boost. Recommend for the intermediate exerciser, not a very beginner.

Con: there are no mile markers; you can't quite stop after 1 mile
Con: too much chatter from mary kay--either directly with leslie or to other cast members. she's distracting
Con: there are only 3 ""boosts"" and the third one is awkwardly fast. I think it would have been better to have 4 boosts with more of them at the pace of boost #2, just longer time allotted for each boost

There's also some loud noises going on off camera, like props had fallen over or something. However, with all that being said, I really liked the workout routine. It was easy to do and had some higher intensity moments to raise the heart rate and tone some muscles. It's a lot of calorie burning movement packed into 33 minutes. After I finished the workout, I decided to play the ""music-only"" version to see if it was better, more edited, (w/o all the mistakes and mishaps). I burst out laughing because all they did was mute the microphones, she's still talking to the camera but without sound! This video really looks like a rushed job.

8339532,3,B001S86JCQ,"Others have already given a breakdown of the total workout time and the basic moves, so I will just give my personal experience with this DVD.

Pros:  You get a good sweaty workout in a short time.  I like the jog intervals.  The ""gang"" was with Leslie, all ages and sizes. They look like normal people. (Not all young fitness models that Leslie uses now.) Music was just okay.  They have a modifier (Joann) for those who don't want to ""boost""/jog.  I use it after a strength workout or on its own.  There is a decent warm up and cool down.

Cons: I say this as a fan of some of Leslie's dvds:  This one seems like it was just thrown together.  Her walkers weren't always sure what Leslie was going to do next.  The man in the dvd  (Steve) seemed as if he had never done the routine before.  I don't mind that, he is adorable and it could be he is uncoordinated. The two major things I didn't like at all were 1) the camera is not always on Leslie when there was a sequence change 2) The quality of the video was not good.  The camera shook many times during the video, some parts were choppy.  Just bad videography.

I took off 2 stars for the poor quality.  It could make some dizzy.  I almost took off 1 star for the routine that seemed thrown together, but the good calorie burn makes up for it for me. It is not one I reach for on a consistent basis since I don't think it is fun.  I can't recommend it. I can recommend another Leslie dvd though.  My favorite is:  Leslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles. I prefer it to this one because has great music, it is fun, great cast, good cuing, has boosted walking in 2 of the miles, and I can get 4 miles in complete with warm up and a yoga type stretch in 58 min. Calorie burn is in the 450 range for me. The 4 miles are continuous so you don't have to go do a warm up and cool down for each mile like Leslie does in her newer dvds. If you don't want to do all 4 miles, you can skip right to the cool down and stretch.",1435449600,5,1989,4.010178117048346
