7837407,5,6303103030,I saw this on PBS in the early 80s. Been looking for it ever since!,1447286400,,67,3.533333333333333
7837408,5,6303103030,"Wonderful script and narration; music was very good.  ""Old"" film quality and I couldn't find in any remastered or disc form, but just added to the ambience.  I eat up the NASA films and fully technical stuff, but this is a work of art.",1384819200,,235,4.318181818181818
7837409,5,6303103030,"This urgently needs to be on DVD.  My copy was on the long dead CED format. Except for a few items (most of the astronauts were not fighter pilots over Korea) this is a brilliant work.  Of course, Orson Welles could make a documentary about a dead goat seem riveting... but here he has some real material with which to work.

  With only a couple of exceptions, documentaries about the first decade or so of space flight tend to make most peoples' eyes glaze over in short order...not here.
The subject matter... the editing... the music... and of course the narration put it into another class.  The comments by the astronauts are not the usual ""Everything was A-OK..."" but have flavor.

  Someone loaned me In The Shadow of the Moon... I fully understand the high praise that it earned.  But I wish that those who justly appreciate it... could see The Greatest Adventure as well.",1371168000,,881,4.625806451612903
7837410,4,6303103030,"Having been a NASA flight controller here in Houston for 30 years, I always enjoy seeing videos taken in the blockhouses at the Cape. This documentary has some good ones.",1371168000,,170,4.7
7837411,5,6303103030,"Although not entirely technically accurate at times, this is a GREAT video that came out for the tenth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in 1979.  Wells' narration is impressive as usual, but this video contains interviews from the history makers themselves...the late Neil Armstrong, Apollo 17's Gene Cernan, 14's Alan Shepard and Ed Mitchell and many more with some commentary from ""The Right Stuff"" author Tom Wolfe.  This is a good period piece that all historians of the Golden Age of Space should have in their library.  It was produced by NFL Films, the same people that brought us all those football highlights reels from years ago and they did their homework on this video.  Only available in video tape format (first in Beta and then in VHS), this is a gem that SHOULD be remastered onto DVD.",1347926400,,805,4.76978417266187
7837412,5,6303103030,"Orson Welles narrates this chivalrous documentary made by the talented filmmakers who gave us NFL highlights in the 70's. It is a ""feel good"" story of the space race to as told by the competitive men who traded dangerous fighter jets for exploding rockets.  [...]

Lots of interviews and footage of astronauts/directors, and tales from the author of the ""Right Stuff,"" Tom Wolfe (e.g. fighter pilots' egos ""are in the league with heart-surgeons"").

It is nicely paced by Orson Welles's (the man who brought us the War of the Worlds radio broadcast).  As the Saturn V rockets to the moon, he narrates:

""Wernher Von Braun's 6 Million pound machine actually flew...
24,000 mph - 10 time faster than a rifle bullet...
150 Million Horse Power...
Gas mileage...5 inches to the gallon...
The ""Saturn V"" soared into the uncharted depths of space...
the manned flight that followed, took Apollo astronauts to see things no man has ever seen.""

The video is entertaining and worth watching more than once (not as cerebral like a PBS NOVA documentary).  [...]
