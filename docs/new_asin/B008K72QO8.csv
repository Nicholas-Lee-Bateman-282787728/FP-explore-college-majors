8528612,5,B008K72QO8,Great video that takes it back to the roost of fmx with natural train riding all the rides in this video have rad bike skill unlike some of the ramp tramps these days,1377820800,,166,4.0606060606060606
8528613,4,B008K72QO8,"Twitch is undoubtedly the best FMX/free rider to date. This DVD displays his ability to read the terrain and make a literal mountain his playground. My only gripes of the DVD are, it left me wanting more...its a little short. The music selection could've been better picked. It's classic, Twitch ""Hoodrich"" but Filter's ""Hey man nice shot"" should've never been used with this flick. All in all, I replay this DVD constantly and it breathes a MUCH NEEDED change to FMX and motocross DVDs. Can't wait for the follow-up!",1368316800,2,517,4.820224719101123
8528614,3,B008K72QO8,"I am a huge fan of FMX especially when it comes to natural terrain free riding. I did enjoy the movie and Twitch deserves every bit of credit being one of the all time best riders in the sport, but the some of the choices in music used in this film could have been so much better. Still great entertainment as far as riding, but all the rap and hip hop garbage almost ruined it for me. Next time i'll probably watch this video on mute and just play some good hard rock music from my own stereo and all will be better.",1358380800,,517,4.029126213592233
