8238705,5,B0010VEDFG,On time and the dvd's seem to function well,1504656000,,43,3.888888888888889
8238706,2,B0010VEDFG,Dull series. Doesn't really stand out in my mind.  I'm a huge Peter Davison fan but I found it boring. Only positive thing to say is the period clothing and cars were well done.,1498521600,,177,4.205882352941177
8238707,5,B0010VEDFG,Excellent quality DVDs - no complaints.  Good packaging.  Complete series.  Recommended (charming stories).,1448928000,,107,7.076923076923077
8238708,4,B0010VEDFG,"This series captures the ""feel"" of the author's story quite well, and the actors fit their roles extremely well. I also
recommend BRITAINS FILMS AND TOYS as a source for such DVDs, as well, of course, as comedies, etc.",1391904000,,218,4.615384615384615
8238709,5,B0010VEDFG,"Wish I could find the books again, but until then, Peter Davison makes an excellent Campion. I bought the complete collection because I lost one volume of my original set.",1378080000,,171,4.733333333333333
8238710,5,B0010VEDFG,"If you enjoy British mysteries,and have not seen this collection,you have been missing out on an enjoyable experience. Great stories,beautiful locations,wonderful cast of characters this is a real keeper. The seller delivered very fast from across the ocean,and at such an attractive price;I bought it and invested in an all region dvd player just so I could add this terrific series to my collection. I am totally happy.",1370995200,,421,5.205882352941177
8238711,5,B0010VEDFG,"Peter Davidson at his best. If you are a fan of The Last Detective then you will also enjoy the twists and turns of Campion. Surrounded by a cast of unlikely characters, solving crime and righting wrongs. I loved every minute!",1311206400,3,226,4.536585365853658
