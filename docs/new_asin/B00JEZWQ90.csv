If you want their most popular stuff live go with war at the Warfield or live intrusion.",1447459200,,310,4.271186440677966
8650406,3,B00JEZWQ90,"i'm not sure if this dvd is approved by the band, looks like an independent release, for the old school fan it's a welcome addition, but i expected more, should've been longer, i mean the contents",1442275200,,196,4.472222222222222
8650407,5,B00JEZWQ90,"Okay, I'm giving this five stars because I grew up on bootleg VHS tapes and in essence that's what this is, just with kickass artwork.  There are absolutely NO official videos on here, or anything official at all.  The back cover has a nice menacing band photo of a lineup appearing nowhere on this disc, taken after Lombardo returned and Tom grew a beard, but before Jeff died.  The first two tracks are amusing, and the time-jumping live clips are all fun to watch and sound good, with bootleg quality audio but level volume.  Be warned, though: the disc's main menu (which looks very nice) is significantly louder than the videos, so be prepared to jump for your volume button after the last track ends.  The two ""documentary"" tracks are snippets of Tom telling stories mixed in with four live songs (South of Heaven, Raining Blood, Silent Scream, Mandatory Suicide) all from the same concert, probably on the South of Heaven tour.  All in all, I think this disc is great and only wished it was longer.  It looks good with my other Slayer DVD's, and I'd recommend it to all Slayer fans, especially the older ones who fondly remember dubbed tapes with xeroxed covers.  The ACTUAL TRACKLISTING is as follows:  1. Interview 1988  2. Backstage Story  3. Raining Blood / Black Magic (Live 1991)  4. I Hate You (Live 1996)  5. Hell Awaits (Live 1994)  6. Payback (Live 2002)  7. Necrophobic (Live 2004)  8. Stain of Mind (Live 2002)  9. Documentary Part 1  10. Documentary Part 2",1435190400,5,1476,4.655038759689923

8650409,5,B00JEZWQ90,"If you are not a complete SLAYER freak - which you really should be, I mean really, the band RULES - you may find this a bit less exciting. I would recommend Live Intrusion or Still Reigning then. If you are a real fan though - you should put it on your shelf. You will know what I mean when you watch it!",1422576000,2,305,3.857142857142857
