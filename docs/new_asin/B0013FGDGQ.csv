3105749,1,B0013FGDGQ,"Sorry, I didn't realize it was all about drinks and vegetables.  Not my personal favorite way to enjoy life and since I'm getting to the tail end of mine, I can't see denying myself the 'good stuff' by swallowing liquids endlessly.  An occasional 'smoothie' isn't bad, but not for a whole way of life.  I wish I didn't spend the money for this one.",1438646400,,348,4.40625

3105751,4,B0013FGDGQ,"Just remember Dr. Fuhrman is a DOCTOR and not an actor...lol...some good information but a little hard to watch as he and his wife appear a bit stiff and unnatural while cooking.  All of Dr. Fuhrman's books, videos, etc. that I have seen are good except as I said, in this one.  I got this with a set, probably wouldn't have bought it stand-alone.",1437609600,,347,4.40625

3105753,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Dr. Furhman is one of my favorites. Just sitting thru one of his lectures will motivate you to a better life style.  He tells you how
to live into your 90's still playing tennis.  If you don't take his advice, you'll likely be in a nursing home in your 70's.  You choose, depending
on if you are dumb or smart.",1435795200,,310,4.133333333333334

3105766,4,B0013FGDGQ,"Not the greatest production, but if you know anything of Dr. Furhman and his Eat to Live books then these recipes hit right at home with what is included with his plan.

The anti-cancer soup is amazing, I made so much I started giving it away to my family and I have not found anyone who hasn't like it
I hope for more content from Dr. Furhman in the future",1412121600,,357,4.1

3105771,3,B0013FGDGQ,okay,1407715200,,4,4.0
3105772,5,B0013FGDGQ,"It allows you to get to know Dr. Fuhrman and Lisa better. I thought it well worth the $ because seeing the people is motivating.
The couple should do a TV show on cooking, or over the internet.
Personal motivation to eat a super-immunity diet is the key, and this DVD is helpful to ""get in the groove.""
I wish it were longer - the presentation is perfectly adequate. As a person who knew Julia Child, the style is up to her standards.
Plus, you get the Super Immunity insight of the couple.

And, about skipping this and just getting the book, the DVD mentions a web site where hundreds of recipes are available.",1407196800,,612,4.368421052631579

3105774,5,B0013FGDGQ,"I had made some of the recipes in his book and was unsure if I was doing them right. I got this DVD and it made a world of difference in the quality of the food I was making. It also helped me with the changes I needed to make to get healthier. By following Dr. Fuhrman's advice and healthy eating style, I was able to have my first child at 50 years old. I was married more than once and my ex-wives went on to have children with other men. My nutrition was so bad that, in hindsight, it must have effected my fertility. Eating for nutritional value has more benefits than you realize.",1402876800,,586,4.104347826086957
3105775,5,B0013FGDGQ,Joel and Lisa Fuhrman are real people and it totally comes through in this video. I can appreciate all the great tips they share. I love the DVD because I can actually duplicate what they do in my own kitchen.,1401926400,,209,4.25
3105776,3,B0013FGDGQ,I keep it around for some of the recipies.  The purchase went fine.  Interesting item for info.  Good info if you are looking for that.,1398556800,,135,4.32
3105777,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Good sound practical advice on recipes you are sure to use. The demonstrations makes
 understanding the process easy and have tried a few of the recipes myself.",1398384000,,160,4.925925925925926
3105778,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Some of the folks who reviewed this DVD said it was amateurish. Yes, you could say that about this DVD. BUT, I learned a lot watching Joel and Lisa his wife put together many of their recipes. If you overlook the simple way this DVD was done, and focus instead on the recipes they're showing you, you can learn a lot. I sure did. Thanks Dr. Fuhrman for a great product.",1393545600,,369,4.211267605633803
3105779,4,B0013FGDGQ,"I like the cookbook, but eating healthy sure takes a lot work. I found it I make enough to freeze and use at a later date - it is
worth the extra effort.",1392163200,,153,3.6666666666666665
3105780,5,B0013FGDGQ,Shows techniques  for healthy cooking as well as recommended ingredients.  Accompanying book is informative and makes applying cooking ideas easy.,1390867200,,146,6.25
3105781,1,B0013FGDGQ,"overall it was very boring and not very good
 I was really disappointed in that I thought it would be a lot more informative there were no real recipes or amounts to put in the recipes",1389225600,,184,4.111111111111111
3105782,1,B0013FGDGQ,This CD is not a good introduction into Dr. Fuhrman's plan.  The quality of the production is not worth the price.,1388880000,,114,4.428571428571429
3105783,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Eating right is made simple with Dr Fuhrman's guidance. It takes discipline but if you want to overcome bad eating habits, shed unhealthy pounds or reverse diabetes you can't find a better resource to keep you on track and regain your health. I know, I've dropped 24 pounds. It works.",1388102400,,284,4.7
3105784,5,B0013FGDGQ,"I checked this out from the library and liked it so well, I will be purchasing it.  I don't agree with the other reviewers about Mrs. Fuhrman--I enjoyed them both in the DVD.

The DVD helps in  recipe creation, giving you categories to put together.  I will look forward to seeing the recipe booklet, which was not present in the library copy.",1383609600,,343,4.483870967741935
3105785,5,B0013FGDGQ,I like watching iformational things on TV. This has alot of real good healthy tips on how to cook for the whole family.,1383091200,,119,4.217391304347826
3105786,4,B0013FGDGQ,Secrets to healthy cooking is great. I appreciate the complete demonstration and ideas to help keep the meals from getting boring.,1378512000,,130,5.238095238095238
3105787,3,B0013FGDGQ,Interesting and informative but not much more than I already know. I've seen him on t.v. and agree with his nutritional information.,1378512000,,132,5.045454545454546
3105788,3,B0013FGDGQ,recipes are too time consuming i am a single parent and don't have the prep time that this takes to complete,1376784000,,108,4.190476190476191
3105789,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Great service - the shipment arrived right on time and without any issues.  It arrived as stated in the ad.
Some of the reviews were correct about the overall production, but that being said, it was okay.  I'm glad I made
the purchase and will donate to my local library.",1373068800,,271,4.4
3105790,4,B0013FGDGQ,"I like that the DVD is more relaxed.  They are showing how they prepare the foods, dressings etc and helped me to feel more at ease in trying to make things like the dressings myself and saving money by doing so.  helpfull for encouraging people to improve their health and enjoy doing it.",1372896000,,289,4.433962264150943
3105791,3,B0013FGDGQ,Some of these tips were good but - really how long can one live like a rabbit.  I would take what you can live with and let the rest go.  As with all diet books -- you have to resume real life.,1371945600,,193,3.5714285714285716
3105792,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Excellent, Excellent demonstration on how to make good, healthy, tasty soup. It has been long known that soup warms you up and fills you so you do not feel like eating so much and with the ingredients in Dr. Fuhrman's soup, you can't help but feel healthier. I love ""from scratch"" dishes. I like to know what I'm eating too. Prepared soups have so many ingredients.
I also wanted to make healthy deserts without adding sugar. This DVD shows you how.
I'm incorporating all Dr. Fuhrman's cooking ideas into my meal plans. I truly believe that ""you are what you eat"" and I want to stay as healthy as I can for as long as I can. I do also believe that all the cures for almost every disease are already on the earth in our fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds.
This DVD is well worth the price if you want to get back to basics.",1367971200,,825,4.261146496815287
3105793,4,B0013FGDGQ,"I love Dr Fuhrman and I think he is the leading genius in nutritional health. He gives a lot of helpful cooking tips in this DVD that I wouldn't have known otherwise.

I would like him to hire better video production team though which made the story-telling more interesting. Then I would give it 10 stars",1365724800,,305,4.446428571428571
3105794,4,B0013FGDGQ,"Like really like all of Dr. Fuhran's Cd's and books.
Watch it once and you learn ....watch it a few times more and you will feel like you are armed with excellent information. Ready to face the world of Nutrition and Health.",1364947200,,224,4.357142857142857
3105795,3,B0013FGDGQ,Not sure I could follow this food plan for a very long time--seems very restrictive although certainly healthy.  You could get just as much information from the book without buying the DVD,1364256000,,188,4.875
3105796,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Anyone who thinks this is not a professional production, or has an ill review towards this priceless product is really lacking. What a wonderful DVD, full of great idea's! Thank you again Dr. Furhman!",1363046400,,200,4.911764705882353
3105797,5,B0013FGDGQ,The video footage in this is not very high quality but the INFORMATION it provides is extremely valuable. They give so many great tips on this DVD and it is very helpful for people who are new comers to this life style.,1361923200,,219,4.238095238095238
3105798,4,B0013FGDGQ,"I ordered both this vid, and the eating like a nutritarian vid as well as some other books of his. All information from each source is similar but with more details specific to each. This vid is kind of like a cliff notes/review of some things from Super Immunity and Eat to Live.",1361404800,,280,4.30188679245283
3105799,5,B0013FGDGQ,"Very helpful great informationJust the item to help with a problem that needs to be handled carefully,
And properly for a healthy life.",1360368000,,135,4.913043478260869
3105800,5,B0013FGDGQ,I want to be my healthiest and Dr. Fuhrman makes it easy and fun. I have several of his books. I like to listen to him explain his lifestyle as he does on this DVD. I recommend this DVD  Austin,1359504000,,193,3.825
3105801,1,B0013FGDGQ,Saw this on Dr. Oz and ordered it. When we recieved it we find out it is a veggitarin diet. This information was not disclosed on Dr. Oz's show or we would have never ordered it. We are returning this book and two others writen by this author.,1358812800,,243,4.083333333333333
3105802,5,B0013FGDGQ,This item was a gift.  It arrived on time and looked good.  It was a gift and it looked good.,1358208000,,93,3.6
3105803,4,B0013FGDGQ,"While I have most of Fuhrman's titles in my personal library, this I gave as a gift to a family member who really needs to learn the material. That family has now begun having daily Green Smoothies, and I think this contributed to it. I also gave them ""Disease Proof Your Child' and ""The Adventures of Mitch Spinach"". God Bless Joel Fuhrman!",1357948800,,341,4.516129032258065
3105804,5,B0013FGDGQ,These are just plain common sense ways of eating.  If you want better health then purchase this dvd.  I have loaned this out to family and they love it as much as I do.,1357084800,,168,3.911764705882353
3105805,3,B0013FGDGQ,"For people who are already eating healthy, these aren't secrets at all.  Dr. Fuhrman has some good information for the novice, but for the price, I would have liked to have seen more information presented.  Not alot of info, but it is good for someone just starting out on how to eat healthy.",1356998400,,292,4.490566037735849
3105806,3,B0013FGDGQ,"For someone who is completely a Vegetarian, this DVD will be interesting.  But for me, the recipes don't do anything.  The DVD is made so a person can understand clearly and does give afew recipes.  Dr. Fuhrman does a good job telling how to prepare these recipes.  It just wasn't for my taste.",1355616000,,294,4.490566037735849
3105807,3,B0013FGDGQ,"This really wasn't what I was expecting.  It's not a very helpful addition to the book.  What it does confirm is that while the dietary concepts may be valid and workable, the kitchen techniques and food combinations are pretty sad and uninterresting.

I would suggest any number of really outstanding vegetarian cookbooks before any of Dr. Fuhrman's.  It seems he's in it to sell his own special products and recipes.",1331078400,,418,4.928571428571429
3105808,4,B0013FGDGQ,"I really enjoyed this video and thought it demonstrated how easy it is to make some of his recipes.  I was especially impressed how he made the anti-cancer soup.  I thought why didn't I ever think of throwing whole vegis in my soup?  I agree it's not Food Network quality but who the heck cares.  Didn't expect either one to be professional tv stars.  I thought the video was really informative and most important I can't wait to make some of these healthy, delicious recipes and improve my health!",1330905600,,498,4.550561797752809
3105809,4,B0013FGDGQ,The DVD had helpful ideas but many of the ingredients are not readily available.  I had to search the internet to get some of the stuff he uses in the DVS.,1329868800,,155,4.0
3105810,3,B0013FGDGQ,Saw Dr. Fuhrman on PBS so thought I would get this video.  Its just ok.  Not impressive.  It's like one of their kids video taped them cooking in their home kitchen.  The camera man must fancy the Dr.'s wife cause he keeps focusing on her instead of showing what they are doing.  I'm a visual person so it was a little helpful.  Not much money so not a waste.  Just can't believe someone would sell something this poorly made.  Unprofessional vs amateur quality.  Good luck.,1326672000,,474,4.482352941176471
3105811,1,B0013FGDGQ,I didn't really like the DVD or the subject content.  I don't think it is a livable way to eat and with economy like  it is alot of the foods and eating suggestions are expensive for the everyday person.  I was very disappointed in the material overall.,1326067200,,253,4.340425531914893
3105812,5,B0013FGDGQ,"If you need a jump start or are like me and seeing is so much better than reading then this is a wonderful start in your journey to good health. Who cares if this couple comes off as professional. You can feel their sincerity and commitment to living a healthy life . The small recipe booklet inclosed is a huge help is making these recipes your own. Candace, Brigittes  Mom",1325203200,,374,4.3428571428571425
3105813,1,B0013FGDGQ,"I'm a great believer of Dr. Fuhrman's concepts but the DVD was disappointing. I agree with other reviewers that it was amateurish and seemed more like a commercial for the Vitamix blender. The DVD was definitely not worth the price, and the money would be better spent in getting his books with recipes.",1322179200,,303,4.735849056603773
3105814,4,B0013FGDGQ,The DVD was a little amatuerish. There weren't many recipes plus I found the same recipes came with the Eat To Live cd's. If buying the Eat To Live book or cd's I would skip this book.,1320796800,,184,4.0
3105815,3,B0013FGDGQ,"Helpful for those who are new to cooking, especially cooking healthy vegetables. Agree with other reviewers that it is not Food Network quality. Would have appreciated alternatives to the vinegars used. Seems like a commercial for Dr. Fuhrman's brand of products and Vegi-Max blenders! As such cost should be a lot less.",1315008000,,320,5.173076923076923
3105816,1,B0013FGDGQ,"This was the worst video I've ever seen.  It was like watching a video for Bass Masters on SNL.  The presentation was so amateurish and the stories were so lame, I was embarrassed that I bought it.  Seriously . . .",1314662400,,214,4.170731707317073

3105818,5,B0013FGDGQ,"I don't understand what lit a fire under that negative reviewer and why someone would actually mark it as helpful.  This dvd is great!  It may not be hollywood production quality but who cares???  Anyone looking to buy this is not seeking entertainment but hands-on demonstrations of preparing some of these recipes.  Probably the customers are people like me, more visually-oriented who can't imagine what a fig dressing looks like simply by reading the ingredients.  Just seeing this stuff being prepared has helped me relax a bit and feel more confident preparing the recipes myself.  If that sour sally reviewer doesn't understand this sentiment then oh well go and return it. I'm keeping mine. FYI if you search youtube you can find many segments of the video plus others but I like the convenience of a dvd in this case. And btw, it's almost a complete 45 minutes of cooking, there are no lectures or rehashes of the book, it jumps right into the kitchen in the first minutes and keeps rolling. Nice work doc.",1309651200,,1015,4.771428571428571
3105819,4,B0013FGDGQ,"First let me say that Dr. & Mrs. Fuhrman are not professional entertainers, so this dvd won't appear like a show from the Food Network. But they demonstrate how they make some of their favorite healthy meals and they give tips on preparing larger quantities so you have food ready in the fridge when you get hungry (to keep from being tempted to munch on unhealthy snack foods because better choices are not at hand). My wife and I enjoyed the dvd and have already prepared the stir-fry (big hit), the hearty vegetable soup and the kale. While the recipes require a relatively large number of ingredients, the results are pretty impressive. It's a wonderful help for enjoying the journey to better health!",1257379200,,705,4.739837398373984
3105820,2,B0013FGDGQ,"This DVD is a PAINFUL approach to very healthful cooking.  The Docs wife SLAUGHTERS each and every demonstration of the VitaMix.  OMG - GET A professional - Every other month Costco has a team of about ten people who can practically do back flips and cartwheels with a VitaMix - and you use YOUR WIFE?!?  WHO CAN'T EVEN GET THE FRIGGIN TOP OFF THE BLENDER?!?  If I were an executive at VitaMix, I'd sue to shut down this video.

Next comment - use a professional CHEF.

This video is a real hack job.  I am sure the doctor and his wife are lovely people and his message is of the utmost importance - - - but to charge $25 for a DVD - I want to learn Kitchen BRAIN SURGERY - not experience two hacks.  For $25 I want Jacque Peppin or America's Test Kitchen folks - hell, I'll even embrace a couple of students from the CIA (Culinary Inst.).

I want my money back!  lol  This video is PAINFUL to watch.

Please don't let this video turn you off to VitaMix - they are SO MUCH BETTTTTER than what is demonstrated here.  Go to Costco and see the demo - you have to see this machine to believe it.

There has GOT to be a better hardcore healthy cooking video out there - I will keep searching and let you know when I find it ;-)",1229817600,,1222,4.10126582278481

It was enough to get me convinced to start the ETL program, seeing that it was not that difficult to prepare. I will admit I also bought the VitaMix blender after this as well -- I was amazed at what they were able to do with whole veggies -- even more than my food processor. But then, I am a kitchen gadget junkie! Back to the DVD, interesting recipes included and demonstrated -- a great accompaniment to the book, Eat to Live.",1221523200,,514,4.255102040816326

It removes any unknowns in your mind on how do I eat raw and healthy foods other than just salads and be satisfied. The instructions and recipes prepared along with the guidance given will give you the know-how and the motivation that you can easily make anything.

I wish it were longer - the presentation is perfectly adequate. As a person who knew Julia Child, the style is up to her standards.

I also wanted to make healthy deserts without adding sugar. This DVD shows you how.
I'm incorporating all Dr. Fuhrman's cooking ideas into my meal plans. I truly believe that ""you are what you eat"" and I want to stay as healthy as I can for as long as I can.

It may not be hollywood production quality but who cares???  Anyone looking to buy this is not seeking entertainment but hands-on demonstrations of preparing some of these recipes.  Probably the customers are people like me, more visually-oriented who can't imagine what a fig dressing looks like simply by reading the ingredients.  Just seeing this stuff being prepared has helped me relax a bit and feel more confident preparing the recipes myself.  If that sour sally reviewer doesn't understand this sentiment then oh well go and return it. I'm keeping mine. FYI if you search youtube you can find many segments of the video plus others but I like the convenience of a dvd in this case.

WHO CAN'T EVEN GET THE FRIGGIN TOP OFF THE BLENDER?!?  If I were an executive at VitaMix, I'd sue to shut down this video.

Next comment - use a professional CHEF.

This video is a real hack job.  I am sure the doctor and his wife are lovely people and his message is of the utmost importance - - - but to charge $25 for a DVD - I want to learn Kitchen BRAIN SURGERY - not experience two hacks.  For $25 I want Jacque Peppin or America's Test Kitchen folks - hell, I'll even embrace a couple of students from the CIA (Culinary Inst.).

I want my money back!  lol  This video is PAINFUL to watch.

Please don't let this video turn you off to VitaMix - they are SO MUCH BETTTTTER than what is demonstrated here.  Go to Costco and see the demo - you have to see this machine to believe it.
