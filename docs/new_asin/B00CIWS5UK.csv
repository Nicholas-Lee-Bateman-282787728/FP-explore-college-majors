8582240,5,B00CIWS5UK,"I originally saw this on a PBS station and thought it was so well done and fun that I had to own it even though I didn't have a universal DVD player. I found one on Amazon and it works great!  That is the only downfall of this item. It is a European region DVD and will not work with US DVD player. If you are a Janite, Anglophile, or history buff, I think you will enjoy this program.",1466985600,,385,3.8734177215189876
8582241,4,B00CIWS5UK,"Very enjoyable. ( Proper DVD Player required- won't work on US region only players)  Jane Austen took for granted that her readers understood a great deal and as we don't know the customs and practices of the time we tend to have to figure out quite a bit. ( There are books on the subject that explain life in the early 1800's which are helpful.)  This program takes on a particular topic- the early 19th century private ball and manages to fill in some of the missing details of her stories.  Balls figure as the most notable way young people could meet and 'flirt' without breaking convention.  This program covers the dances, the costumes, the amazing food, and the program was filmed at Jane's brother Edwards 'second' house located in the village of Chawton which was a nice touch.  There are shots of the exterior of the cottage in Chawton where she lived also.  I do wish they had done a multi- part, more comprehensive series though. There are certainly enough Austen scholars in England to help with the endeavor!  The program hosts were understated and agreeable - not too overly 'talky'  like some of the programs I have watched...",1462406400,5,1143,4.68
