1342714,4,B00004REDT,"At over 300 dollars this is clearly a minority taste. 'Heimat' is an enormously-long film that is usually shown on television in digestible hour-long chunks. It's best to think of it as a superior soap opera, although it has nothing at all to do with 'Dallas'. There isn't really a plot, as such - the film follows the lives of a group of people living in a twentieth-century (mainly pre-WW2) village in Germany. It's massive in several sense of the word, and has a scope as epic as '2001', but on a human scale. Although it goes on for over half a day, it's generally quite mesmeric. Lots of things happen, but it's all about a slow accumulation of details. I'm sorry if this review seems vague - reviewing this film is like reviewing forty years of history, in three hundred words. There was a sequel of similar quality, released as 'Die Zweit Heimat'. The title means 'homeland'.",972000000,5,882,4.5886075949367084
1342715,4,B00004REDT,"A sequel to the even-longer 'Heimat', this is essentially a lengthy, episodic drama serial masquerading as a single film. Viewed in one sitting, it lasts for over 12 hours, so you'll probably view it as it is shown on television, in bits.
What's it like, though? It's basically a superior soap opera - we follow a group of young people (the main character seemingly modelled on Stockhausen) through university and beyond in post-war Germany. There isn't really a plot, as such, so it's best to think of it as a chunk taken from somebody's autobiography, filmed verbatim. As such it's an enjoyable immersion in other people's lives, rather like a Robert Altman film but with the overlapping conversations separated and stretched-out.",972000000,5,732,5.0578512396694215

The Price is very good too. Somebody forgot to put an 1 in front of the two.

The new tapes cost around 28 $ and the used one around 128 $

What a wonderful world.

7920994,5,B00004REDT,"See this film for great movie direction, acting, and discriminating characterizations; if you savour cultural subtleties; if you find 20th-century European history fascinating; if you think the dynamics of community life have much to tell about the human condition; if you've ever wondered what it meant to be German in the 1920s, '30s, & '40s (although the film covers 1919-1982); if you can't quite understand how Nazism could have gained acceptance and then pre-eminence in a northern German village far removed from Berlin and full of the usual diverse personalities; if you want to put a human face on the monolithic histories about war and propaganda.
Heimat is a superb cinematic chronicle of social and political change in human enterprise, a Bildungsroman of a community. You will not forget it. (by Tabarnouche-Canada)",1076630400,9,828,5.28030303030303
7920995,5,B00004REDT,"There's no denying this, but I had heard of Edgar Reitz's 1984 magnum opus but paid little heed to this 923-minute arthouse epic upon its release and the various reviews accompanying it. Then in 1992, completely Unemployed/able, bankrupt (both financially and spiritually) and [upset] as friends went out for drinks/girls/A Good Time on a Saturday night, as one does ... I thought I'd give this much-vaunted German drama a go.
The first TV episode (of eleven) was two hours long and I anticipated my friends returning somewhat worse for drink during it ... But they did not return, which was fortunate as ... I watched open-mouthed with wondrous appreciation of the sheer and heart-warming brilliance of a simple tale of everyday vicissitudes and emotions spanning sixty-three years of a small Hunsrck village's history, most of it seen through the eyes of Maria (Marita Breuer). Slow-moving it certainly is, with many of the black & white and colour outdoor scenes carefully composed tableaux ... but it was soooo captivating ...
Many languages and cultures have words or concepts that do not fully translate into other languages. The Dutch have 'gezellig' (~ cosy, comfortable, together). The English have 'fair' (~ honest, sporting, equitable). In the German-speaking lands Heimat means 'homeland' ... and more than that: it also means family, belonging, the roots, heart, soul and lifeblood of that homeland. Already part of German literature, the Heimatroman of the Third Reich was one of only four 'acceptable' genres in literature. That may make it somewhat un-PC today, but still, it was the most 'tame' of that vile ideology's strands of Blut und Boden: the yearning of, and for, the home soil ...
There's also a lot of balderdash posited and hypothisized about the true meaning of the concept 'Heimat.' ""Four phases parallel Germany's discontinuous history: Heimat literature as a response to modernization and to regional tensions before World War I; the inter-war period when Heimat divided into racist ideology, left-wing opposition, and inner resistance to the Third Reich; a post-war dialectic between escapist 1950s Heimat films and right-wing claims to the lost lands in the East to which anti-Heimat theatre and films in the 1960s and 1970s were a response, with the urban Heimat in GDR films adding a socialist twist; regionalism and green politics in the 1980s and German identity beyond Cold War divisions. A key point of reference in debates on German history, Heimat looks likely to continue in postmodern and multicultural mode.""
The fictional village of Schabbach (probably situated in the stretch between Emmelshausen and Boppard?) is, like many small villages throughout the numerous German uplands, quite remote and isolated from the hubbub of German cities - certainly before the radio age. Social contrasts are as great as those between small-town America in the Midwest and the great cities along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It remains charmingly untouched by the Big Bad World despite the encroachments of time, ideology and modernity.
Cannot help wondering if James Cameron saw the final episode, ""Das Fest der Lebenden und die Tten,"" with Maria joining the spirits of the village's departed - P>Watching HEIMAT, EIN DEUTSCHE CHRONIK over the eleven weeks was a genuinely unforgettable experience. Have since availed myself of the 6-volume VHS set of this 'First Heimat' (the second, set in Mnchen in the turbulent student year 1968. But since receiving the videos, it took a while to actually sit down and watch all the episodes (have done so now!). Confess to having put it off, put it off [repetition intentional] ... knowing that with each episode's viewing I'd sit there mouth-gaping and watery-eyed (probably quite embarrassing) with all telephones disconnected/switched-off and bottles of German wine or wheat beer suitably chilled and at hand. But even upon watching HEIMAT again, I was surprised just how much could be remembered with so little effort. So deeply ingrained and memorable, both in mind and in soul, was the first viewing in 1992 that it was almost a real-life experience: of having also 'lived' those years as part of Schabbach and its people ...",1045008000,50,4208,5.189705882352941
7920996,5,B00004REDT,"Edgar Reitz's panoramic epic is irresistable as character after character joins the story with compelling life tales. The screen oozes the kind of life situations that even the best soap operas could but pine for and the music, the drama, the soul searching, the erotica, the aching tensions WOW! This film at 25 hours long IS TOO SHORT. If this masterpiece does not hypnotise you and reshape your soul then you have no soul.
Buy it now and show it to everyone you have ever known - they will thank you for it.",1006473600,5,510,4.494623655913978
7920997,5,B00004REDT,"This is the best movie I have seen for its grand scale, historic presence, and relentless probing into the meaning of our individual existence, the artistic way, the youth way, the eternal way. It has haunted me ever since I first saw Heimat 2 in a theater at Berkeley seven years ago. It made my forgotten dreams reappear and I had to pause and think hard about futures.",1002844800,10,371,4.470588235294118
7920998,5,B00004REDT,"It sounds almost a little bit too exaggerated when I say that this miniseries brings you a lot closer to understanding Germany between  1900 and 1970. But hardly ever has a drama such as ""Heimat"" delivered so much insight into the German psyche, without the usual cheesiness or the overbearing morale that is common to so many movies of this kind.  It takes hours to sum up the plot, just so much: The series revolves around  the live of Maria, a woman who, from early childhood to her death, lives in  a small village in the western German region of Hunsrueck. Here, life is  not a show of poor but noble people. It is every turn a struggle for small  things, for small comforts, for small gradual improvements over many  decades.  All historical developments in Germany are experienced by the villagers  as influences from the outside world gradually transform the community: The first world war and the suffering immediately after it, the hyper- inflation, which leads to the emigration of that woman's husband (without her knowing), the brief occurrence of the ""Golden 20s"". The Nazi period is most impressively described: Little petty and opportunistic village  Nazis and their ambitious wifes try to strive for more, the ""Autobahn"" brings a glimpse of the modern world, and short-lived hopes for Maria.  The second great war brings all this to a grinding halt, until the  ""Wirtschaftswunder"" (the ""Economic Miracle"") kicks in and brings not only the first prospects of good life into the village, but also the effects of  the stuffy post-war (the ""Adenauer"") era, with its longing for consolidation. The focus of this series changes quite often, i.e. it is not only Maria's view that is presented to the audience, but that of other protagonists as well. As a prime example, one episode focusses on the forbidden love  affair of Maria's youngest son Anton with an older woman (delightfully played by Gudrun Landgrebe).
If you think of buying this set, do not hesitate. It is worth it!",982540800,30,1989,4.898507462686567
