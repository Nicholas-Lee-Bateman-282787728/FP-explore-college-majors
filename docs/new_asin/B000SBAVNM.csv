8205080,4,B000SBAVNM,"I really love these B-Horror movies! All the movies in the set were exactly what I wanted, bad acting, paper monsters and funky sexual behaviors! Keep 'em coming I will buy as many as I can! After a while though I start getting doubles of movies, but I keep them for a rainy day! I highly recomend this Movie pack to anyone who loves the B-Horror Movies and has a lot of time on their hands!!!

Randy and Rachel Grant",1305590400,,417,4.2125
8205081,5,B000SBAVNM,"This pack of many low budget horror films is a good way to get a taste of real low budget horror films, and a lot of it. The price is cheap and good for 50 movies. The picture/audio quality on all the movies is not that great but very watchable. The acting and effects suck. There are no known famous actors. Who really cares because there is a lot of camp value and stuff that is so bad it is funny. With so many different movies you are bound to find something entertaining. If you like very low budget horror and films that are extremely independent/underground, I recommend this.  If you are one of the many people expecting high budget horror/hollywood film pictures/acting/special effects STAY CLEAR of any of these type of sets. I otherwise recommend this set!",1284336000,,767,4.557971014492754
8205082,1,B000SBAVNM,"All of these movies look like they were shot with a VHS camcorder in a garage with people who have never acted a day in their lives. Sure, I don't THINK I could make a better movie; but if I made a movie like one of those included in this set, I would rather make no movie at all.",1284249600,,280,3.76271186440678
8205083,1,B000SBAVNM,"These movies aren't even campy, much less scary.  The acting is not on par with the standard high school play; yes, it's really that bad.  No entertainment value whatsoever.  You will get more out of your twenty bucks by using it for toilet paper than you will from buying this dreck.",1201910400,2,284,4.529411764705882
8205084,4,B000SBAVNM,"This is probably the worst DVD BOX SET I have ever purchased....And I am enjoying every minute of it. For starters if you are a fan of YouTube or internet videos, then you will like this set. If you are not, do not waste your money. If you do not like seeing really fat and ugly girls naked, do not waste your money.  If you do not like seeing the worst actors attempting to act, do not order this set.  If any of this stuff does appeal to you, by all means order a copy; however, I thought the other Pendelum package&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Decrepit-Crypt-of-Nightmares-50-Movie-Pack/dp/B000QQDKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares 50 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;was a better disc set.",1195776000,5,751,5.521739130434782
8205085,3,B000SBAVNM,"PENDULUM PICTURES is an independent distributor that (for better or worse) has given amateur and would-be filmmakers the opportunity to break into the movie business. Production values of these shot-on-Super-8 bloodbaths are slight, often the stories seem improvised, audio clarity can be an issue, and the want of pro actors is glaringly apparent. And yet, these odd little films still hold a certain appeal: for the fan of the ultra-violent, most definitely, but they are also evidence that anything is possible, hard work does eventually pay off, and dreaming of a movie career is not necessarily wasted time. (If you doubt it: some of the once-unknown actors and directors here now have a cult following!)

Are any of these fifty movies ""classics""? Not really. Do they cater to a fringe element? Probably. Does the TOMB OF TERRORS 50 MOVIE PACK belong in all home video libraries? No way. You must admit though that titles like ""Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires,"" ""Flesh Eating Ghouls From Outer Space"" and ""Purvos"" are somewhat amusing-- and that may be the appeal of this collection: in spite of graphic depictions of death, dismemberment and other atrocities, in the end it's all just ACTING, and all in good (if bizarre) fun.

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DECREPIT-CRYPT-OF-NIGHTMARES-50-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000QQDKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES 50 MOVIE PACK</a>&nbsp;is a perfectly creepy companion piece to this DVD box set.

8205086,5,B000SBAVNM,"I bought this at Bestbuy for 20 bucks and so far I've enjoyed many of the movies on it. There are over 50 films so it might take me a while to get through all of them, but so far I've enjoyed ""Revenge of La Llorona,"" ""Inexchange,"" ""Granny,"" and ""Gorno."" ""In The Cut"" is also an original idea. I read some of the reviews on here and it amazes me how people don't get what type of box set this is. It's a compilation of indy/low-budget horror films... NOT big budget, plot-less Hollywood horror films. I'm not going to say every film on this set is awesome because there are a few that I think are not that great, but for the most part there is A LOT of good stuff - if you give them a chance.",1194652800,20,691,4.0144927536231885
8205087,2,B000SBAVNM,"This is not one of those fun 50 Movie Pack Sets that are part public domain treasures/part OK to good older films and hidden treasures/part bottom of the barrel. Even in the bottom of the barrel material, though, you can usually find some stuff that is so bad that it is good. Unlike the Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs, the films in this package have all been produced since 1990, and more than half of them have been made in the last four years with more than a few films produced in 2006. That's record time for material to be shuffled off to a cheap public domain movie pack, and for good reason. Some of the films in this pack have some interesting psychological angles, but the majority of them are just poorly acted bloodbaths, or in many cases they are just plain boring. I would list the films with their stars, but I can't find one of them with an actor or actress or a director I have ever even heard of. My advice is, this year for Halloween, stick with the 50 Movie Horror and Sci-Fi packs from Mill Creek. There's certainly some junk in them, but there is also plenty of good campy fun and some films that are pretty good for their genre that just slipped into the public domain for no good reason other than just the passing of time or the bankruptcy of the studio that made them. I'm not saying there is nothing of any value here. I'm just saying that you can do better for your money. The following is a list of the included films and their years of production:
