7972796,5,B00006RJGT,"a simply beautifully finished film.  the finest actors, a director who knows what he's doing and a cameraman who creates the script the director is filming.  oh, yes.  a very sweet and sensitive story.  in parts.  the other parts are what is really real in human lives.  it is hardcore human.  as you get into the circumstances of the people your meeting you've already become a part of the film.  you care. you smile. you suffer.  you have seen a very good film.  I hope you like it as much as i.",1522368000,,497,4.304347826086956
7972797,3,B00006RJGT,"In my quest to see more of French (Corsican) beauty Laetitia Casta I picked up a copy of this French film to see what it had to offer.  Ms Casta initially made her debut on the world stage as a model for the likes of Victoria's Secret and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editions, as well as, a plethora of French fashion mags.  In this respect there are comparable similarities in her rise to 'stardom' with her illustrious 60's vintage predecessor: Brigitte Bardot... to whom she has often been compared.  To date, however, I would have to say that Laetitia's excursions into film have not demonstrated an ability to 'light up the screen' the way BB did for a generation of male fans, and ""Love Street"" (""Rue Des Plaisirs"") is (sadly) another example of this reality.

This (2001) film is perhaps Laetitia's first shot at a real 'starring' role.  The plot evolves around a small statured male character named 'Little Louie' who was born to a prostitute mother in one of the infamous gilded Parisian bordellos from the early decades of he 2Oth Century. After a brief 'set-up' that establishes Louis' birth and later (adult) life surrounded by friendly whores - the film proper is set in 1945 - at the point in time when societal trends in France were calling for the abolition of all the 'houses of sin'. Into this scenario comes Laetitia's character: Marion - a fresh faced gamin who is very popular with 'the men' and also catches Little Louie's eye.  Louis realizes that she is way out of his league so he takes pleasure in 'attaching' himself to her as 'a friend' and sets about trying to find the ideal mate, and singing career!, for her, to bring joy into her life.  Unfortunately, the match-making goes sorta awry as Marion falls for an attractive, down on his luck, young hustler type named 'Dimitri' and Little Louis has his work cut out for him trying to keep 'the dream' alive for Marion and her flawed choice for a BF.

Over-all this is a well made film and has good production values - lotsa nice 40's vintage ambiance and looks inside the life at the classy brothel ""Le Palais Oriental'. Sadly, there just isn't much 'heat' generated by Laetitia & her co-star(s) as the events unfold to a rather sad conclusion.  Despite the bordello setting there is (surprisingly!) no skin on display by anyone - least of all Ms Casta - though there's lots of French lingerie to be appreciated!  Laetitia's performance is adequate - but that's about it - and the short 40's hair style that she sports gives her more of a 'cute' look than the smoldering sexiness that she often displays in photo layouts.  The movie is in widescreen - French language w/ English subs.

Ironically - perhaps the most satisfying role that I have seen Laetitia in, to date, was her portrayal of Brigitte Bardot in the (2010) biopic
""Gainsbourg"" - based on the life of the French pop-star of the same name - who dated and recorded some songs w/ BB, back in the day.
Hopefully Laetitia may yet find the vehicle that allows her to translate the quality that she displays so magnificently on the printed page up onto the silver screen.  ""Love Street"" IS an engaging little film - perhaps worth a look for Laetitia-philes and/or fans of 'French cinema', of which this is a prime example.",1398988800,2,3261,4.640625
7972798,4,B00006RJGT,This actually was a good movie although Laetitia's character could have used more background info. She doesn't speak much and it would have been better if they'd developed her character beyond using her physical beauty to tell the story. Her lover has more character development than she does although he could have used a bit more info too.,1384128000,,341,4.896551724137931
7972799,2,B00006RJGT,"Rue des Plaisirs is one of Patrice Leconte's occasional misfires. Framed as `Pigalle Dany Rose,' with a trio of streetwalkers on a rainy street relaying the story of the son of a prostitute who determines to find the right man to make the new girl at the brothel where he was raised happy, there's more than a touch of The Hairdresser's Husband to it, not least in the intercutting of Patrick Timsit's character as man and child, but there's none of the sensuality despite some potentially promising setups. Among the chief problems is Laetitia Casta, who simply lacks the presence or allure to make the role work: her manner is generally sullen, her acting poor and her singing voice weak, so it's hard to see what the attraction is for such a one-note personality and little surprise that there's not a hint of chemistry with either of her leading men. Still, as Leconte has said in the past, the advantage of making relatively short feature films is that if you bore the audience, at least you don't bore them for that long.

If you don't speak French, be sure to only order the Canadian DVD since the French DVD has no English subtitles. Seville's Canadian DVD boasts a nice 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with optional English subtitles plus an unsubtitled 45-minute documentary (where Casta displays all the lightness and appeal that she so sorely lacks in the feature) and the original French trailer.",1182297600,3,1404,4.801652892561983
