8166658,5,B000M52WD6,"This is a powerful movie. It was not about having the winning season, it was just the victory of a school who seemingly lost so much just trying to rise from the ashes and begin to make something magical happen. I love the ideals behind this movie and I am a proud owner of it. Their story serves as a reminder that anything is possible if you are just willing to not quit.",1397520000,,373,4.123287671232877

8166662,4,B000M52WD6,"We had seen ""We are Marshall"", the Hollywood version of the Marshall tragedy and were thrilled to find a version that was absolutely true.  Of course this was a tremendous tragedy and this movie covered it very well; however, bear in mind this is from ESPN so it is mostly from a football standpoint.

Personally I would have liked more about the actual people and the tragedy, perhaps more background of some of the deceased.  However, if you are a football fan I would highly recommend this movie, not only for the history part but also what an outstanding team Marshall became.",1327276800,,580,4.666666666666667

8166664,4,B000M52WD6,"In recent decades, the Thundering Herd of West Virginia's Marshall University's football program are known as the winningest team of the 1990s, with two national championships ('92 and '96) and a 30-plus game win streak at decade's end that includes victories in the 1999 and 2000 MAC Bowl. Heisman Trophy nominees Chad Pennington and Randy Moss both played for the ""Herd,"" a reincarnation once called the ""Young"" Thundering Herd to distinguish them from the team that perished on a flaming mountainside when their chartered jet crashed miles short of Huntington's airport.

The 48 minute ESPN documentary REMEMBERING MARSHALL: 30 YEARS LATER was originally broadcast on 11/14/00, the anniversary of that terrible day. Two surviving players, a coach, relatives, former Marshall students and local newspapermen all contribute to this memorial program.

The story is of a struggling team that flew to Alabama for the season's last game but never made it home alive. Outside of town, their plane hit a mountaintop and smashed nose first into the ground at about 200 mph. A re-creation of final pilot/tower chatter precedes TV news films of the crash site. This conversation makes it clear that the pilot couldn't locate a runway during a foggy rain. A fireball erupted in the night and instantly, 75 players, coaches and fans were gone.

A woman who lived near the crash site phoned the Herald Dispatch's Jack Hardin. He raced to the scene and thus describes the chaos all around and the deep shock of boosting himself onto a fallen tree trunk that was actually a body. All victims charred beyond recognition, two players who didn't make the trip, DB Nate Ruffin and 2nd string QB Reggie Oliver, were asked to identify teammates from articles of clothing or jewelry. Eventually all but 6 victims were positively IDed.

Assistant coach Red Dawson, driver of the team's booster bus, expresses remorse that he didn't  perish with the rest, a feeling shared by Oliver and Ruffin. All three chose to stay on at Marshall and helped rebuild the Herd that rose from the ashes of tragedy to achieve greatness.

It's a properly subdued story of ruin and rebirth, one that balances recollections of individuals lost against the significant gains (such as a new stadium) that are a direct result of the worst aviation crash of 1970 and in NCAA history.
