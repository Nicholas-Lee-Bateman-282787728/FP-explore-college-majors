2582109,4,B000FQISGC,"I was excited to see that I could purchase these two classics in one. Great nostalgia for those- like myself- who grew up watching these movies. I favor the sequel, but they are both delightful memories.",1178496000,,203,4.666666666666667
2582110,5,B000FQISGC,"These two movies are Disney classics, especially the first one, ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" - I saw this movie back when I was a kid and it was one of my favorite movies (still is).  It follows the story of two orphans named Tia and Tony who have extraordinary powers.  Not knowing where they came from, they set out following a map in the only belonging that they have ever owned- Tia's starcase.  Along the way there are several men after them, one of which is a ruthless man out to use them and their powers to his twisted advantage.

The second movie, ""Return to Witch Mountain"" is weaker than the first, but still worth the watch.  Tia and Tony are much older in this one, but much more comfortable in their own skin because they know who they are and where they came from.  Tony is kidnapped and brainwashed/controlled by a ruthless scientist who commands him to use his power while Tia gets the help from a local street gang full of delinquents to save him.

The movies are loosely based on a novel by Alexander Key which is also titled ""Escape to Witch Mountain.""  I recently found out that he also wrote ""Return to Witch Mountain"" but I haven't had a chance to read it yet.

The first novel is worth the read but VERY different from the movies.  For example, Tia is mute and does not speak.  She communicates with Tony telepathically.  They are also older in the book than they are in the movie.  The orphanage that they go to at the beginning of the movie is more so for juvenile delinquents in the book and filled with bullies and a pretty mean caretaker.  If you liked these movies, I recommend checking Ebay for the books!

I'd give ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" 5 stars and ""Return to Witch Mountain"" 4.  They are both classics!",1177459200,12,1738,4.418238993710692

However, I lost interest with the sequel, Return to Witch Mountain, within the first 10 minutes. If you have seen neither film, I highly recommend Escape to Witch Mountain. It is enjoyable for the entire family.",1169164800,4,293,4.88
2582115,4,B000FQISGC,"This DVD puts ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" and ""Return from Witch Mountain"" on a single disk.  Having both movies on one disk is nice, but this collection misses the extras on the individual DVD's.  Avid fans of these movies should get the individual disks and pass this collection by.

In 1975, Disney Studios found magic with ""Escape to Witch Mountain.""  The special effects of ""Star Wars"" would soon eclipse those of this movie, but many of those still hold up today and make this movie a lot of fun to watch.

Tony Malone (Ike Eisenmann, who appeared in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"") and Tia Malone (Kim Richards, whose acting career mostly stopped in 1985) appear to be orphaned.  But there is something strange about Tony and Tia.  They can do magic!  Well, maybe not magic, but they are telekinetic, telepaths, and both seem to be able to foretell the future.

We meet Tony and Tia as they are entering a children's home.  When we overhear Tony and Tia talking to each other using telepathy, we know Tony and Tia are out of place.  Tony and Tia are also nice kids.  Tia tells Lucas Deranian (played by the late Donald Pleasence, a veteran of more than 100 movies and television shows in the last 20 years of his life) not to get into his car.  Moments later a tow truck demolishes Deranian's car and Deranian suspects that Tia may be a very special child.

Deranian tells his employer, Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland, another veteran actor, who struggled to find better roles after his ill-fated appearance in the critter-fest ""Frogs"" in 1972) that Tony and Tia may have powers.  Mr. Bolt has been seeking supernatural guidance for some time.  Mr. Bolt, wealthy multi-millionaire that he is, fabricates all sorts of documentation to be able to adopt the children for his own nefarious purposes.

Tony and Tia are quick to figure out that Mr. Bolt is sleazy and they make a break for freedom.  Mr. Bolt sends all the forces in his power to find them.  Fortunately, Tony and Tia encounter kindly Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert, yet another veteran actor) and his camper.  Though Jason appears gruff and bluff, he is actually a nice man who decides to help the children.

Throughout the movie we catch we catch glimpses of visions that Tia is having.  These visions and a secret in Tia's star case will guide the children to the place they belong, Witch Mountain, with Mr. Bolt hot on their trail.

""Return from Witch Mountain"" was a follow up to the 1975 movie.  The original was more charming and clever than this movie, but this movie featured many more special effects than the original.  Even though this movie was more formulaic than the original, it is worth having and watching, particularly if you enjoyed the original.

Tony and Tia are back again.  This time they are taking a vacation in Los Angeles.  Uncle Bene (Denver Pyle) drops Tony and Tia off at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles, where Tony and Tia catch a cab.  Things go awry almost immediately.  The cab runs out of gas.  The cab driver leaves to get more.  While Tony and Tia are waiting for the driver to return, Tony senses that a man is about to fall from a building.  What Tony does not know is that the man falls during an experiment conducted by Dr. Victor Gannon (Christopher Lee).

Dr. Gannon recognizes Tony's potential immediately.  If Dr. Gannon could combine Tony's mental powers with his mental control device, Dr. Gannon could have incredible power.  Dr. Gannon captures Tony and places one of his control devices on him.  Unfortunately, Letha (Bette Davis), his sponsor, has significant financial problems and her goals are somewhat more immediate and financially oriented.

Letha and her nephew Sickle (Anthony James) take Tony and the control device to a museum that is displaying $3 million in gold.  The heist fails when Tia shows up, supported by a gang of four boys.  Tia begins interfering with Tony's disruption of the museum, and the would-be robbers leave in haste.

Dr. Gannon is furious, but he decides that perhaps he could combine his desire for power with Letha's need for money.  He plots to take control of a plutonium processing facility.  Before Dr. Gannon and his gang head out, they trick Tia coming to Tony and then capture her.

The excitement at the end of the movie increases as Tia tries to stop Tony from wreaking havoc on the nuclear plant.  Tony's actions throughout the movie confuse Tia because she is unaware of the control device until near the end of the movie.  I leave the viewer to see how things work out for Tony, Tia, Mr. Yokomoto (Jack Soo), a truant officer, and everyone else.

This movie is relatively weak, but is worth watching because of the actors involved and some of the special effects.  Christopher Lee is always fun to watch.  Letha is one of Bette Davis's lesser roles, but she was a great actress.  Kim Richards is cute and earnest.  Tony and Tia go together, so Ike Eisenmann is a requirement.  The special effects range from weak to outstanding.  I particularly enjoy the van scene at the end of the movie, which you will have to watch because I will say no more about that.  The chase following the attempted museum heist is very good; one of the best chases in a Disney movie.

These movies were almost too late.  ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" shocked the world with breakthrough special effects in 1977.  Subsequent films topped each other with ever-better stories and special effects.  Had these movies come any later, there may not have been an audience for them in theaters, and direct-to-video releases were still in the future.  Lucky for us these films were made so we can see Tony and Tia as often as we like.

Enjoy!",1167609600,4,5690,4.65929648241206
2582116,5,B000FQISGC,"Here is a one-disc cheapie version of the two ""Witch Mountain"" films. This is an economical alternative to the separate 2003 releases of these films, however, this release is lacking all of the wonderful extras and audio commentaries. This edition would make a great gift for casual fans who simply want to see the movies. And if you've not seen them before, here are my comments:

In ""Escape To Witch Mountain"" (1975), Tia and Tony Malone are two psychic, orphaned aliens on the run from a evil capitalist (Ray Milland) who wishes to use their powers for gain. This particular film is a nice departure from the usual 70s Disney fare in that it treats its sci-fi subject matter rather seriously, not devolving into camp as was the usual recipe for films of the era. Eddie Albert has a nice turn as a bitter widower who befriends the children, as the three of them go on the run; almost like a kids' version of ""The Fugitive."" The chase scenes are endless but suspenseful and mostly engaging. The special effects are few and generally revolve around objects being levitated. Look for a hands-free marionette show that could have given Maria VonTrapp and that lonely goatherd a run for their money. The film was shot in 1975, but there is very little in the picture to date it, besides some rather clumsy process shots at the film's finale of a UFO and a flying Winnebago. The UFO was cheesy even for its day. However, the film was very successful among children of the time because of the relatable characterizations of the two leads and the believability factor that Disney provided.

The same cannot be said for the 1978 sequel, ""Return From Witch Mountain."" Quite unlike its predecessor, this film is all about camp. HIGH camp. Whereas the first film was a bit coy about the use of the kids' powers, this one exploits those powers for all they're worth. People fly through the air. Cars fly, crash, and magically are put back together. Goats go for taxicab rides. The film is far less believable, but still a lot of fun. You know you're in for a camp-fest when the villains turn out to be none other than Christopher Lee and Bette Davis! The plot this time concerns the two aliens taking a little vacation in sunny Los Angeles. Christopher Lee, playing a character named Victor (what else?) uses a mind control device to seize Tony's little alien brain and it isn't long before cars fly through the air, gold bricks disappear from a museum, and a plutonium processing plant is under psychic siege. Tia runs for help from a would-be preteen street gang, and Jack Soo, playing a truant officer in a nice supporting part. The ""gang"" is strictly a Disney version of a gang, with names like ""Muscles"" and ""Dazzler."" The Los Angeles they inhabit looks more like Dresden after World War II, but it's just a short trip from the Rose Bowl and Victor's castle, yes I said castle, somewhere in the heart of L.A. where he's got Tony strapped up to enough dated 50s lab equipment to bring Frankenstein back again. The UFO shots in this film are, if possible, even worse than in the first film. Some of them even look like they were stock footage from ""Escape."" These shots nearly killed the picture, seeing as how it was released after ""Star Wars."" Bette Davis is a star soprano of camp, hitting the high notes in her role as a aging socialite who finances Victor's evil experiments. She's at her woozy boozy best, barking out commands at the top of her lungs and abusing all in sight. All in all, these movies are two very different movie experiences. The difference in tone in the second movie may be jarring for some fans; they'll just have to turn up the volume on their Suspension of Disbelief--in order for it to be heard over Bette Davis.",1160438400,34,3734,4.605105105105105
2582117,4,B000FQISGC,"I'm glad to see these movies released on DVD together. For those of us whose storage space is at a premium, it solves a couple problems. :)

Seriously, I saw these movies for the first time several years ago, after seeing the Direct-to-TV Disney remake, which made me want to see the originals.  They are very different. About all they really have in common is the title, and kids with strange powers.

The classics are usually considered the better though, and these kids turn in great performances in both movies.

In ""Escape to Witch Mountain"", Tony and Tia Malone are placed in an orphanage, not really knowing where they came from. Tia carries a strange box with her that has two stars on it. From the beginning, it's apparent that they are not your garden variety kids, as they manifest unusual abilities which either unnerve or thrill those around them. On a field trip, Tia saves a man (Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"" fame) from getting into his limousine, moments before it is totaled by an out-of-control vehicle. Pleasance relays this to his employer, a greedy millionaire who adopts Tony and Tia, with plans to exploit their powers.  When they discover his plans, the kids flee, stowing away in the RV of a grouchy Eddie Albert (best known for the TV series ""Green Acres""), who eventually gives into their charm and helps them find their way to a place called Witch Mountain. Throughout the movie, Tony and Tia's early memories come back to them and they realize the reason they have these powers is because they are from another planet, and the last survivors of their homeworld have settled on Earth. But with the millionaire on their tails, can they find their way back to their own kind?  I won't tell you the ending. See it for yourself. :)

In ""Return from Witch Mountain"", it is evident how much time passed between the two movies. Tony is a young teenager, and Tia is now becoming a young woman. They return from their isolated community on Witch Mountain for something of a vacation among the people of Earth. But when a rich criminal woman and her equally greedy scientist henchman observe Tony using his powers, they kidnap him. Thanks to the scientist (Christopher Lee of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), they put a mind control device on Tony, making him their slave. They begin exploiting his powers to pull off dangerous criminal heists, which raises the police's attention. Meanwhile, Tia is abandoned in the streets and makes the friendship of a gang of tough, but kind, street kids, who eventually rise to her assistance as they attempt to rescue Tony from the control of the bad guys! Again, no ending from me! See it yourself. :)

In some ways though, I liked the 1995 remake better, since it had more people I was familiar with, and the remake left me with a kind of warm fuzzy feeling which the originals didn't quite manage to do. But Disney still hasn't released the remake on DVD, and it's been years since I've seen it listed in the TV guide.

Disney's quality has definitely gone downhill over the past decade. About the only good thing they have on their channel these days is ""The Suite Life"".

So, if you want good Disney entertainment, go for their older stuff. It may not be superfancy, but at least it's got quality. And the Witch Mountain movies are a good example of that quality.",1157500800,19,3329,4.64625850340136
2582118,5,B000FQISGC,The first movie escape to witch mountain was great just like I remembered it when I was kid. The second movie return from witch mountain was a major letdown. But for true witch mountain fans it was still worth watching as genuine follow up to the first movie. That's why I still gave it a five star rating.,1477958400,,306,4.293103448275862

In fact, when the first movie was over they begged me to let them stay up to watch the sequel!

2582164,3,B000FQISGC,"Being a kid in the mid 1970's I had seen at least ten Disney movies in the theaters back in the day.  When I saw this dvd for sale a couple of years ago I bought it thinking how great it would be to see both movies again.  I enjoyed the first one remembering Tony & Tia being my age at the time wondering what they are doing now.  It's a cute little story with some suspense at least for a 10 year old.  But when I saw the second one I was disappointed to see some misfit kids stealing the show and Tony being in a trance through 90% of the movie.  You also have two Super stars (Bette Davis and Christopher Lee)in the movie.  I ask you ""Why are they in this corny movie?""  This is one of the worst sequels next to Caddy Shack 2.  Buy it only for the first movie, Escape to Witch Mountain.",1208044800,,789,3.9182389937106916
2582165,5,B000FQISGC,"I grew up in the 70's and 80's so I remember when these movies came out and I used to have a poster in my room when I was a kid, so this brought back some good memories for me and now that I have kids, it was wonderful to share this movie with them and they loved it just as much as I did when I was a kid, and still do now. You can't beat Walt Disney when it comes to wholesome family entertainment. I would recommend this to anyone who has children. Watching the movie today, the special effects are a bit corny but it is still fun and enjoyable to watch.",1206921600,,557,3.8521739130434782

The main characters are children, and this is a kids movie, so don't expect anything racy.

Both these movies are fun and even playful explorations of physic powers and those who would abuse them.  Suitable for children six and up, fun for adults too.",1204502400,,376,4.753846153846154

2582169,3,B000FQISGC,"Watchable, generally entertaining movies marred by some truly sub-par special effects (especially the completely unconvincing flying Winnebago in the first film and the helicopter flying upside down in the second film) and an overall lack of true menace.  Getting both films for the price of one DVD is a big plus, permitting me in good conscience to give this offering a modest recommendation.  It also helps that a few big names lend their acting talents to these films, including Eddie Albert, Christopher Lee, and Bette Davis, giving a little something extra for adults to watch (though all these actors have certainly done better work before and after these movies).  Nice, sharp prints of the films are used for this DVD, but there aren't any notable extras to speak of.",1198713600,2,776,5.0

2582171,4,B000FQISGC,"Escape to Witch Mountain was wonderful.  Return from Witch Mountain is awful in that the mouth moves and the words come later. It is so distracting and Amazon KNOW about this - I am very very surprised they allow such poor quality to leave their shop.  So Amazon have feet of clay.  Used to think they could do no wrong.

My only problem is the sound quality of the DVD is very poor. It had to be turned all the way up on the TV, and yet it sounded as if an old reel tape movie was running in the background almost drowning out the talking in the movie itself. I know its not our system because its all brand new flat screen and brand new DVD player. Perhaps they should check the quality before shipping it out.",1189036800,2,550,4.055045871559633

Davis: ""I can just smell the money."" Lee: ""Next time...."" She autographed her photo to Lee::""Chris: Hope one day we REALLY ACT in a FILM"", This shlock is sequel to a 1973 film, in which the female juvenile lead says repeatedly, ""We've got to get out of here.""
