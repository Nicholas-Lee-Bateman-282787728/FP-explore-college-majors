6284047,4,B00IOFDKAK,I did not know what to expect when I receive this animated movie other than I read from the other reviewer. I was surprise to see the movie has a good story line. The animation was well done. It reminds me  of Hayao Miyasaki's animated work. My only seatback was I was to busy reading the subtitle instead of enjoying the movie. (FYI I read really slow) So if you don't mind subtitle and you can read fast I highly recommend this movie.,1405382400,2,436,4.253012048192771

6284049,5,B00IOFDKAK,"I will try to resist the temptation to heap praise upon praise on this show in this review and keep it informational. I was so very impressed with this show that the very first episode convinced me to purchase it.

The most similar anim I can think of to this show would be Spice and Wolf. It has good animation, many quotable lines, a beautiful ending sequence and song but the greatest thing about this show is that it makes you think. It is not an action show (though there are elements of that at times). It takes a clichd battle of good against evil and turns it on its head, making distinctions of good and evil seem artificial and misleading. The villain, in this case the Demon King turns out to be much smarter than the hero who doesnt even understand the term economy. From the very first debate between the Hero and the Demon King in the very first episode, you can see how intelligent and well-written the show is. And so I was hooked from the very first episode.

The central plot is based on a very important part of war that is often left out of shows that are concerned with such things  the war economy. The challenges they face are also not ones that can be overcome by swords and spells. Instead of defeating each other the challenge they face is to establish peace by improving the lives of the peasants and outsmarting the real villains of the war  the war profiteers.

People don't often associate concepts like economy and monetary policy with entertainment. It is then to the great credit of the Japanese that they are able to include such mundane concepts as those in their plots and make great shows out of it. It is something that Hollywood should learn from.

It is truly a travesty that this show was not dubbed in English. Had it been dubbed perhaps it would have garnered much more attention. I encourage everyone to give this show a chance and petition Sentai Filmworks to dub it.",1402617600,3,1912,4.464183381088826
6284050,5,B00IOFDKAK,"For 15 years humans and demons have fought a never-ending cold war as neither side gaining any advantage over the other.  However a Hero as appeared and is ready to take the fight to the evil Demon King and storms the keep, only to discover the King is actually a lovely, ample lady and she has been waiting for him for a long time.  She has a plan to bring to war to an end with no winner and to bring prosperity to both sides, but she is going to need help and she needs the Hero to bring it to fruition.  But of course no plan is going to start off easily and it will take some time to see the end of the path, but maybe these two might gather enough support to see the other side of the hill (peace).

This show I enjoyed.  The characters are all well developed from the King to Head Maid to the Kings, the story well paced and the art was beautiful.  The King could have been shown as a normal bouncy woman, but this woman has something most of them do not, a brain and is not afraid to use it to get what she wants (but does not stop her from using her looks every now and them (especially in episode 1)).  It gives the viewers an insight to some of todays issues of war and economics, but it still manages to keep light hearted banter and even romance (the King and Knight over the Hero).  And the hero is also not a complete meathead - he feels insecure in his place at the beginning, but as he progresses with the plan he finds that he has more to offer than just a sword.  This could have easily have gone a full 24 or more series, but I think they paced it just right and ended it where they needed to.  I will have to pick this up for my collection someday soon, but have way to many already on my plate.  I give this a must watch to those who want a good story as well as a little romance.",1399248000,13,1802,3.9502762430939224
6284051,4,B00IOFDKAK,"A hero's job is to defeat demons and save people from their vicious clutches. So when humanities' greatest Hero invades the Demon King's palace, it is his aim to defeat the demons once and for all. But the Demon King ends up being a pretty young woman with an unusual proposition for the young hero - an alliance to bring about a peaceful end to the their war.

Maoyu is a refreshing series. Instead of fighting desperate battles to end the war, Maou plants potatoes and works to manipulate economies. There are discussions about how war affects the economy, technological advancement, and politics. This series is often compared to Spice & Wolf in how it talks about economics, but I thought Maoyu handled the technical stuff much better (and I liked the series better overall). The characters are fun and slightly more complex than shown at first glance.

If there is one thing I didn't like about the series it would be the odd amount of fan service . If felt strange for Maou to be such an intelligent person in one scene and then bosom bait in the next. It also made the series feel rather unbalanced.

One odd thing about the series is that none of the characters have names. They are referred to by their positions/jobs. So the two main characters, Maou and Yuusha, are literally Demon King and Hero. There is a Older Sister Maid and a Younger Sister Maid and many others like that.

Maoyu is a fun show with interesting topics and enjoyable characters. It is only 12 episodes and tells a complete story (so no cliffhanger ending or random cutoff). If you enjoy stories that involve economics and the study of society, then this is the series for you.",1397692800,15,1658,4.591216216216216
6284052,4,B00IOFDKAK,"Now this is based on the opinion of a person who mainly consumes anime, cartoons and video games and not too much in terms of television sitcoms and dramas apart from the random comedy from time to time.

Maoyu is about a hero who has made his way into the castle of the demon king to slay him and end the war between humans and demons and bring peace to the land. Why? Because demon's are evil. He even has special god like powers and is a master at battle. Immediately the anime introduces the hero to a cleavage heavy female demon lord and she wants him! Wait! So this is Generic Anime #541 at this point.

What makes the anime so great and refreshing? What is so intelligent about a way too much cleavage and a sexy demon lord in love with the hero that's supposed to kill her? Well it's actually the demon king herself. As much as she is quickly the ""sexy love interest"" she immediately takes over the show with genuine charm and intelligent debate. That's right. What makes this show so special is this female demon king that could have easily been nothing more than a  a pair of breasts in some funny brainless harem comedy suddenly turns the show into an intelligent deep look into the war economy, advancing technology and how to find REAL peace. With the demon lord being the one with the plan, knowledge, and charm while the hero is just ""her knight"".

The story is actually very calm and is composed of just trying to make this very risky long term plan of the demon king come to fruition. Not much in terms of action and even the hero takes not that he feels lacking around the demon king as he feels he is just a sort of meat head around her who's only skill is killing things. Even still the story is not lacking in terms of a climax and bouts of suspense. A lot of things can go HORRIBLY wrong when you are against and a part of both sides of a war with the ultimate goal being that they both rule the world together. Still it does have it's random love triangle moments and fan service bits but for the most part it is no where near what the average harem anime has.

The characters are great and most of them are well explored and unique. The hero isn't the typical anime push over male lead by being charming and actually confident while feeling inadequate around his demon king. As for the demon king she is extremely intelligent, advanced, and clever while still being self-conscious and lonely. While the rest of the cast all add a different dynamic they all aren't all fully explored. Still the one's that play important roles they find a way to make you care when needed.

In short, it's a good anime if you are a fan of intelligent clever female leads and an intriguing twist on an overly common anime set up.",1394755200,37,2734,4.340508806262231

6284064,5,B00IOFDKAK,fun little story that unfortunately ended on a bit of an odd note. The parts following the demon kurultai were not covered by the anime unfortunately.,1448064000,,150,4.8076923076923075
6284065,5,B00IOFDKAK,"After fifteen years of brutal, indecisive warfare between humans and demons, a human Hero comes along, equipped with great fighting skills and overwhelming magical powers, ready to end the war with a single stroke by slaying the Demon King, but after leaving behind his equally heroic companions and storming the Demon King's castle alone, he finds a beautiful demon girl who says that she is the Demon King and that she belongs to him, and he to her, and has ever since he was born.  Instead of fighting and killing each other she suggests that they join forces, in what is all but name a marriage contract, and discover a way to end the war in such a way as to bring real peace and true prosperity to both humans and demons alike.

This truly is an odd one, in many ways reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spice-Wolf/dp/B00HXEWFWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spice & Wolf</a>, that proposes to teach you something while telling you a story, namely how improvements in food production, education, and certain scientific breakthroughs can lead to increasing prosperity, greater freedom, and peace.  As such, the most exciting scenes are not the battles, though they are exciting enough, but rather other things: a fiery stem-winder of a speech that rouses a population of cowering peasants into a revolutionary army, an intricate commodity futures trading scheme that undermines a more powerful enemy's war effort, and an abandoned human garrison and associated merchants working out a power sharing arrangement with the demon inhabitants of a human conquered city whose trust said garrison's good behavior has earned and who have no desire to see war roll through their hometown for a second time.

It is also a hilarious, fan service featuring harem tale, as both the Demon King (Queen) and the Female Knight struggle to get the virgin Hero they are both in love with to make up his dithering mind, which does not get easier when the Fire Dragon demon clan Grand Princess joins the contest.

Defects?  Well, the lack of character names takes some getting used to; everyone in this world is known simply by his or her title: the Hero, the Demon King, the Knight, etc.  More importantly a noticeable amount of detail was lost cramming this story into a mere 12 episodes; in particular the Mage, a character apparently inhabited by three spirits simultaneously is barely utilized and not at all explained.  Still, this was a fun and, yes, educational romp that I'd love to see continued or amplified in English translations of the novels and the manga.

Just be careful if you watch it.  Like the stubborn, pigheaded sons of nobles personally taught by the Demon King in disguise as the Crimson Scholar, if you are not careful, you might learn something,...

without even realizing it.

6284070,3,B00IOFDKAK,"Maoyu is a show I wanted to love and say buy it right now, yet there are many glaring flaws that if you're a devote anime watcher,like myself, you'll notice immediately. The good first, the animation is really well done and the characters, despite having names like hero and demon king, are intriguing and unique. The bad comes from the characters, plot and overall pacing. The show does a lot of skipping time, like months and years will pass in two episodes, and there are 13 episodes. This creates a story that seems to go too fast and too slow at times, nothing is fully fleshed out and characters never get explained enough to care about. Even the main two characters end up being characters you won't care for much by the end. Top all of this off with a horrible ending that resolves nothing between characters and you're left with a story that just feels rushed and underdeveloped. I said in my headline think spice and wolf because in a lot of ways this tries to be that show. Instead of epic fights or confrontations you get a more focused view of how developing lands works. Characters trade items like compasses and potatoes where they apparently never existed and how they affect life in towns. Look I go on and on about this shows flaws but it was an okay watch. It doesn't do much to warrant re watching it or even buying it but one watch will at least be worth the short amount of time the series has.",1429747200,7,1416,4.42911877394636
6284071,2,B00IOFDKAK,"Cute story, but it was never finished! Is there more to this saga? It has been quite a while since this story was made available; an ending would be nice!!",1426032000,,155,4.2
6284072,5,B00IOFDKAK,"Maoyu expertly adapts the trappings of Japanese fantasy tropes to an innovative, if not wholly original approach to medieval-age fantasy. Discarding the simplicity of Good vs. Evil, the story presents a world of grey wherein the ""right"" action and the ""just"" action are in consrconstant flux.

The plot is similar to A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court in that the protagonists are attempting the feat of developing the world beyond its current state, though their motivation is to end the war that has been raging for a hundred years between humanity and ""demons"" by obviating its economic necessity. Overall, it's a fascinating deconstruction of epic fantasy, and well worth viewing.",1423958400,,693,5.243243243243243

6284074,5,B00IOFDKAK,"Didn't buy it but I have seen it. I would buy it in English (even though they'd likely butcher it). But its actually unique and interesting. It started out fairly typically but it took a turn from being what I thought would be another harem and actually ended up having a lot of depth. Discussing slavery and the importance of education. It was a very pleasant surprise from your average anime. My only problem personally is character designs, They're pretty average; but that's really the only flaw I can pick at.",1422748800,,514,4.65934065934066

6284077,5,B00IOFDKAK,"I'm not a big fan of subtitles. However, I can put up with them for a great show like this.

The Hero, from a land where demons and humans fight an unending war, decides to single-handedly find and kill the Demon King, thus ending the war and bringing peace and freedom to all, who live happily ever after.

Needless to say, it doesn't turn out to be that easy.

First of all, the Demon ""King"" is in fact a buxom young woman who has absolutely no interest in fighting with the most handsome visitor she's had during her short reign. Second, she's a good deal smarter than he is and patiently explains that even if they could get everyone to agree to end the war, doing so would quickly ruin both realms' economies and lead to a return to the cycle of growth and famine that had been the norm before people started dying in the endless conflict. Fortunately, she has a plan to fix everything.

So the two swear a pact to one another and set out to a small human village to try out the Demon King's theories, which (spoiler alert) mostly involve introducing four-field crop rotation, a magical new food called potatoes, and the ideas of ecology and economy to nobles who only seem to care much about glory and chivalry. To the Demon King, the benefits seem overwhelming and obvious.

Needless to say, it doesn't turn out to be that easy.

I'd really love an English dub of this.",1415577600,,1376,4.4189723320158105

6284079,5,B00IOFDKAK,"I had seen this online well before the DVD release but it is a sweet Fantasy romance comedy anime series. It has no real fighting but portrayed political maneuvering in a medieval magic Fantasy setting. Character development is a strong suit. The animation is gorgeous and the ending was not bad at all even though it was left with things that could yet be further covered.

I really like the DVD cover design for the Maoyu set. I would certainly agree your getting an exceptional anime series.",1412467200,,494,4.67816091954023
6284080,4,B00IOFDKAK,"Maoyu could have been many things including ""boring"" and ""a waste of time"" if the creative staff behind this fantasy/history genre-bender hadn't put in as much work as they did. The show is cut from many familiar, even over-familiar, cloths, but the synthesis of all these elements has resulted in a series that feels fresh and light  a considerable step above the mire in which fantasy anime typically drowns.

In a world literally populated by role-playing game archetypes, humans and demons have been fighting a long war of indecisive skirmishes and ineffectual campaigns for years now because of course they have. However, the humans have recently been able to gain an advantage through the victories of Hero, a young man who is exactly that. Hero and his other companions are RPG protagonists in a world of normal people and are basically winning this war singlehandedly. On a whim, Hero leaves on his own to fight his way deep into demon territory to assassinate the Demon King and bring an end to the war.

Demon King turns out to be a young girl, bright-eyed and busty  whoa, hold on; just  review's not over yet. Hear me out.

The first episode of Maoyu is less of a first chapter and more of a prologue or even a proof of concept. After first presenting its laundry list of fantasy clichs, Maoyu calmly sets those conventions aside and starts explaining itself rather ambitiously. Demon King is interested in ending the war but does not want to do so through victory or defeat for either side. She wants to end the cycles of poverty, violence and prejudice that make war so profitable and desirable for those who run it. Enlightened thinking will end the war on its own by erasing the causes of war outright. Of course, she needs Hero's help to do so. For a series built on what initially feels like a metric ton of immovable clichs, Maoyu ends up becoming an ambitious little gem  a fantasy written by an idealistic economist with a love of the Renaissance.

Episodes tend to revolve around some aspect of actual European history, introduced into a world much less complicated than ours. Sure, it would be pointless to actually try and end an ongoing war purely by means of education, liberalism, and some fancy economics, but presenting these theoretical solutions within such a simple fantasy world is satisfying in a ""faith in humanity"" sort of way. Anyone with a passing interest in European history could easily find the series riveting for its presentation alone. Technical explanations of crop rotation or tariffs are designed to be succinct and visually appealing, dodging both of the usual anime traps: fewer words and fewer shots of characters yammering does a series good. It's not a visually impressive show, but it provides enough visual interest and the occasional flourish to ease the flow of its subject matter.

It is Demon King and Hero, though, who keep the show's high-flying premise grounded and light. Their agreement to seek peace quickly becomes a sweet romance with the usual physical awkwardness of almost-kisses and teenage blushing; these scenes are little firecrackers and it's too bad that there aren't nearly enough for the romantics in the audience. Given the shortage of such things, their romance goes through a great deal more emotional development. Demon King and Hero are not without their insecurities; she has put the weight of two worlds on her shoulders while he worries about his perceived uselessness in a world soon to be defined by peace and not war. They share these fears with each other and support each other with gestures of true love, both spoken and unspoken.

These characters are not the deepest you've ever seen, but that is not to say that they lack depth. In a society filled with archetypes, these slight but meaningful bits of development are enough to communicate their positive effect on the world. They are no longer limited by the roles after which they are named; they can be people now. Seeing this little change in each of the characters is one of the show's delights. With a supporting cast that includes names such as Female Knight and Big Sister Maid, the writers do just enough to create actual characters from those molds.

""Just enough"" is a fitting turn of phrase to conclude this review. The creative staff here have really done just enough to make a very good show. It's not a great show, but it delivers on its premise with just enough earnest effort to make it. Demon King and Hero's relationship is not explored enough, but the strong base emotional connection is there. The show rushes through its last two episodes, but the pacing is otherwise pleasingly brisk and never breakneck. The show occasionally falls back on fan service or outdated sexual humor, but the light tone is otherwise set by the heart inherent in the premise itself. All excusable flaws, especially considering such a refreshing product.",1412121600,,4898,4.853892215568862
6284081,5,B00IOFDKAK,"Maoyu isn't like anything you've ever seen. While there are attractive female characters, it doesn't find itself awash in fanservice, albeit there are a few gags early on about the titular character's endowments.

One could describe it as a condensed history of the Reformation and the Enlightenment as told in a fantasy setting. And while magic is used in a few of the battle scenes, largely it's real world solutions that are presented for the larger problems facing our protagonists. Heartier, more abundant crops are sewn to start relieving famine. The printing press is developed to spread information faster. When a young girl is to be stoned to death for heresy, it isn't a knight in shining armor who saves her, but her impassioned speech about the dignity of humanity stirring the crowd against the yoke of their oppressors.

And all the while, the characters are believable and engaging. We're made to understand the nature of their struggles and their plight.

8644027,3,B00IOFDKAK,"With director Takeo Takahashi and script writer Naruhisa Arakawa bring over their experience from Spice and Wolf, the overlap between the two shows are almost identical as Mayou tries to put a very human face on some issues it presents on a topical level. Everything from politics, agriculture, human worth, education, and even societal structures are concepts that get explored and exemplified over the course of the series. However, instead of doubling down on the subject matter like Spice and Wolf did, it only seems to serve as a thematic footnote or food for thought as many of the down and dirty details get left out to pasture. Being slightly disappointed by this, it is something of a relief that the series doesnt get too entangled into the niceties and spends more time focusing on how these social issues play a role in the everyday lives of the characters as well as what the main leads have to do to set things on the proper path.

Where the narrative does mainly revolve around the Hero and Demon Lord wheeling and dealing behind the scenes and playing their strengths to influence both the human and demon realms, I do like how they aren't the major center of attention and how that more falls on the supporting roles. Despite said roles being very muted compared to other series, they do have some nice moments in the show and actually represent what the Hero and Demon Lord are working toward besides stabilizing the world: putting power into the hands of the people. Granted, the moments are few and far in-between, when I did see characters like Elder Sister (yes, people actually go by titles instead of given names) or the Winter King come into their own, it didn't make me stand and applaud, yet did bring a smile to my face. That being said, while side and secondary characters do receive some sort of development, I cant really say it is enough to build any attachment since the story does switch back and forth between factions to showcase the vital importance of their roles. Again, nothing terrible yet also not terribly interesting either or gives any extra character to the many players at the table. Of course, at the end of the day, much of it is still the Hero and Demon Lord working together and seeing the relationship between them grow.

As much as I liked the characters and concepts, the flow of the narrative is one area where Mayou does have a few weird problems. With most events seeming to happen on a whim, transitions from one episode to the next feel awkward and slightly jarring  most likely a symptom from the source materials beginnings, yet it is an aliment that can be easily overcome (or least getting used to) with time. And where it is enjoyable to see how all the smaller pieces and movements made by the cast come together to form a conclusive result, the in-between segments are sort of repetitive and begins to fray the nerves. With very little in the way in the way of tension or disruption, it usually circles around to the trite romantic tension between the Hero and Demon Lord or the cast trying make sure their carefully thought out plans come to fruition. If you are someone who likes constant intrigue and action, the series does seem to lack in that regard, so brace yourself for a more methodical and slow approach.

When it comes to the visuals, studio Arms does a decent job animating the characters and the action sequences, but the actually artwork itself  the finish product is less than impressive. More like looking at abstract pieces in an exhibit that had to scrounge the bottom of the barrel for talent, most of the background work tries to pull off a low-grade impressionistic style and a fraction the foreground looks even more undetailed and barren. For a world that is supposed to be reflective of high fantasy, the set dressing designs in regards to the artwork is probably the only disappointing aspect. On the other hand, the musical score is nothing special either, yet the tracks do capture the fantasy essence far much better.

With fantasy genre finally running its course with the same old recycled plot threads and themes, it is nice to see that Mayou puts it best foot forward in changing up the formula and showing that there are still some good ideas to be had. I cant exactly call it the cream of the crop, but good for it is and turns out to be. Even though another season (which probably will never happen) would be great to see where things go from here, as of now, I am somewhat content with this fantasy endeavor.",1517184000,,4511,4.639549436795995

8644033,5,B00IOFDKAK,"- Synopsis: An untraditional story about a blossoming relationship between two long-time enemies: a Hero and the Demon King. The story takes the viewer to when the Hero confronts the Demon King to finally put an end to the war. However, he wasn't expecting a beautiful red-headed Demon King welcoming him with open arms and an ample bosom. After some persuasion, the Hero and Demon King bound themselves to a consensual contract to change the world for the better for both sides: humans and demons.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is refreshing, albeit short, and turns a common situation into a unique and interesting development. It has low amounts of fan-service and is suitable for many viewers. It is dialogue-heavy and gives the viewer a reminder how some of the things we take for granted first had to start off. So, it is also educational, too. The romance in this anime also helps establish various moods and shows that demons and humans may eventually be able to peacefully coexist.

- Analysis: The concepts of good and evil aren't as black and white as many people may think. Consider people such as Robin Hood, in which he stole from the rich and gave to the poor. While many people may have conflicting notions of whether that is right or wrong, this further emphasizes that good and evil is highly complicated in certain situations. Likewise in this anime, the notion that demons are evil by default and that humans are not evil is highly shallow-minded. As both humans and demons are capable of kindness and cruelty.

Another overlooked concept is that many people focus on what makes others different. They ignore or often fail to recognize that other people are more similar to themselves than they may think. So, discrimination and racism are only born out of ignorance or the delusional refusal to accept the truth. Not only is this present in animes such as this, unfortunately, this concept is prevalent in reality.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. It's about 5 hours long and comes with all 12 episodes on one Blu-ray disc. Rated TV-14 for violence and some fan-service.

- Conclusion: Overall, it's a nice change of pace involving the traditional hero and is loaded with exposition. Suitable for more mature audiences that enjoys dialogue. Also shows that despite the differences between humans and demons, there also many similarities between them. An often fundamentally overlooked concept (think religion, politics, and other various ideologies).
