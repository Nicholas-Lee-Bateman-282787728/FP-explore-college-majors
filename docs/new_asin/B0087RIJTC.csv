5140558,2,B0087RIJTC,"The banter between characters seemed forced.  There were a few cringe-worthy moments, but overall...not worth the money or the 5 star reviews.",1344470400,2,142,5.454545454545454
5140559,5,B0087RIJTC,Not sure why the critics gave such bad reviews. Lots of laughs. Typical Jay Chandrasekhar/Lizard humor .  Mr Chandrasekhar is hilarious.,1344211200,,136,5.476190476190476
5140560,5,B0087RIJTC,"Tommy tries everything to get his wife Audrey pregnant, but becomes worried and frustrated that he is to blame, regardless of his efforts. Panic-stricken Tommy is haunted by Audrey's wish to get pregnant, he decides to do everything he can to make her happy and keep the loving relationship strong. He decides to recruit his friends and an Indian ex-mobster to rob a sperm bank, where he made a donation to years ago. However, his big plan and everything you can imagine to go wrong does. Failure of Tommy's plan puts limits on his relationship with Audrey. A comedy with lots of laughs, combined with drama. Acting Performance Good and Entertaining throughout.

Overall it was nothing to write home about, but I got it on a very good sale period so it was worth the $5 for some cheap laughs.",1428796800,,190,3.8974358974358974

5140569,2,B0087RIJTC,"How do movies like this get made. Really pretty terrible. The only thing funny about this movie is how bad it is. I can't say I hated it, but really pretty bad.",1411171200,,160,4.03125
5140570,5,B0087RIJTC,"Very funny movie.  I enjoyed it, so many comedic lines.",1409875200,,55,4.5
5140571,2,B0087RIJTC,"I love Broken Lizard.  Super Troopers is one of my favorite movies.  I was willing to forgive Club Dread for being not as good, and then turn a blind eye when they decided to do Dukes of Hazard with only a few mentions of the old cast.  I loved beer fest, just not as much as Super Troopers, and now there just seems to be all of these would be bit comedy movies by Jay Chandresekhar, the director of Broken Lizard who is the India guy from the troupe.  This film tries to be racy, and I love Olivia Munn, but the performances here are just so wooden.  I don't expect anything to really get solved, but this film is so lazy.  None of the gags play off well, and the group of friends should be broken lizard, at least in my head.  Sure there are not a lot of great R rated comedies coming out these days, but do yourself a favor and save this one for streaming service online if you have to see it.",1382400000,,897,4.033898305084746
5140572,4,B0087RIJTC,"This is a pretty good movie for the buck.  It is not a high budget blockbuster, but it keeps your attention throughout the movie and has a great plot.

Very funny",1377302400,3,162,4.193548387096774
5140573,1,B0087RIJTC,"If I had the option, it wouldn't even get one star. I couldn't even get through the beginning. Is this what they call rated R now a days??? It was none other than a porno with a longer story line. Animals included in human sex is not my idea of a good joke. Its demented and perverted.",1372118400,,285,4.017543859649122
5140574,5,B0087RIJTC,the movie came sealed and was new. I do not have anything else to write just ned to use up the magic number needed to complete this.,1370736000,,132,3.925925925925926
5140575,1,B0087RIJTC,"Oh my goodness.  This movie is awful.
The behavior of each character is completely unfathomable, everybody has completely unrealistic reactions to all of the situations in this movie, and none of the actors have ANY sense of comedic timing. It was weird!!! It felt like watching a movie made by 15-year-olds! Stupid 15-year-olds.",1367020800,,329,5.2075471698113205

5140577,1,B0087RIJTC,"The movie itself was pretty boring and dumb, not much of a background story or a very good story line. And the quality of this video was terrible, my led ever looked so bad.",1360454400,,173,4.117647058823529
5140578,2,B0087RIJTC,"It was a neat concept, awkward pacing and some jokes that didn't quite come off well pull it down. Worth a rental.",1356480000,,114,4.2272727272727275
5140579,1,B0087RIJTC,I thought because I loved Beerfest and Super Troopers so much that I'd like this one too. Not so. Definitely pass. Neither my husband or I thought it was funny in the slightest.,1350864000,,177,4.393939393939394
5140580,4,B0087RIJTC,"Broken Lizard films aren't for everyone, basically they are raunchy college humor type films. Although this isn't an official Broken lizard movie with all of the usual cast, we still have the same type of humor. Jay Chandrasekhar is funny as usual, and the best scenes are the ones he's in.  This movie starts a little slow, but gets really good after we meet Jays character. I was lucky enough to meet the Broken Lizard group at a comedy club, really nice guys. Overall, this movie isn't as good as Super Troopers or BeerFest, but definitely worth watching if your a fan of this group.",1350777600,,586,4.580952380952381
5140581,4,B0087RIJTC,"The Babymakers is a funny film about a couple who decide they wish to have children.  The husband has low sperm count, but earlier in life made donation to a sperm bank.  Ultimately he and his friends must break into the bank to retrieve his donation.

Much humor abounds during the reproductive testing and the break-in scheme.  Be warned:  The film is rather raunchy, and the humor is not for everyone.  There is plenty of foul language and even some nudity.  However, if you enjoy films such as ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" ""40-year Old Virgin,"" or the ""Harold & Kumar"" films you will probably enjoy this as well.",1349827200,,611,4.601851851851852
5140582,2,B0087RIJTC,Didn't even watch a third of this movie til I turned it off. I felt that it was kind of disguting! Maybe you will enjoy it more than I did!!,1349568000,4,140,3.7
5140583,3,B0087RIJTC,"""When they said you couldn't have your sperm back they robbed you of your future and you have every right to go take it back."" On their three year anniversary Audrey (Munn) and Tommy (Schneider) decide its time to have a baby. After months and months of trying they end up going to see a specialist. After finding out that he is the problem he freaks out until his friends come up with a plan. They decide to break in to the sperm bank and take back Tommy's deposit. I had pretty high expectations going in to this one and it's mostly my doing. I have been trying to watch movies without seeing the previews for them first in order to not have any preconceived ideas and I say the preview for this one a ton. I will admit that it was still really funny and worth watching but this is another movie where it seems like the funniest parts are in the previews. I'm not saying there are other funny parts because I did laugh throughout but overall I would have to say I was a little disappointed. This is still very much worth watching though. Overall, funny throughout but I was hoping for funnier. I give it a B.",1347926400,3,1110,4.265402843601896
5140584,5,B0087RIJTC,"The Babymakers is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. I could not stop laughing through the whole thing! Paul Schneider and Olivia Munn make a great pair, and the rest of the cast backs them up really well. Although a slapstick humor-filled movie, it still has a romantic comedy feel to it. Loved it, ready to watch it again!",1346976000,4,338,4.380952380952381
5140585,5,B0087RIJTC,"This is a really funny movie, ours not your typical comedy that you will see in the theater. Of you are looking for something that is a little different and fun this is your movie.",1346889600,,180,4.171428571428572
5140586,3,B0087RIJTC,The previews made this movie look so much better than it really is. It starts getting ridiculous and not funny at all. Drags on. I would save your money!,1346889600,,153,4.310344827586207
5140587,3,B0087RIJTC,"First, if you're looking for Broken Lizard comedy, you may be disappointed.  This isn't a Broken Lizard production and isn't nearly as off the wall as they tend to get, but if you're a fan and are craving more in between real BL productions, this might be a nice bandaid.

It's a pretty basic comedy that has a handful of laughs.  Worth the free movie credit I spent on it.

My biggest gripe is Amazon's streaming.  I piped this from my laptop to an HD TV and while I didn't expect HD quality, the compression was pretty lousy even with a good internet connection.  Netflix is usually a bit better and Vudu comes across in crystal clear BluRay quality 1080p.",1346889600,,658,4.441666666666666
5140588,1,B0087RIJTC,"I chose this video because I thought the trailer was hilarious.  Sadly, the trailer was the only part of the movie that was remotely entertaining.  The movie degenerates into slapstick bathroom humor and masturbation jokes.",1346889600,3,223,5.3428571428571425
5140589,5,B0087RIJTC,"I didn't know how this movie was gonna work, i mean a guy stealing sperm c'mon!!!! But then after 15 minutes i was hooked on this slap-stick rollercoaster.",1345852800,,155,4.571428571428571
5140590,5,B0087RIJTC,"I was laughing a lot especially for a few scenes.  This movie was not made by any studio so you can diffidently see that they were able to do their own thing.  A few parts were slow and could have used something a bit more.  There is some nudity but none from Olivia Munn so if you are looking for that, its not here.  I'll most likely be watching this movie again with a bunch of friends when I get back to college in a couple weeks.",1344556800,2,434,3.954022988505747
