2065342,5,B00027NVX4,"This is one crazy flick!  Well, where do I start? Odd angles, cool locations, Grave-robbing, selling dead bodies on the black market, strange visitors in town, stranger residents that live in the town, freaky funeral home on the hill overlooking the graveyard, odd mortician, religious nut for a wife, the he/she assistant, embalming, morbid flashbacks, bizarre hallucinations, drug use, heavy drinking, bad accidents, dead corpses in trunks, necrophilia, menacing old ruins behind the house, haunting music, dark secrets, the mystery character buying dead people, mysterious secret meetings on back roads, the minister with half a face, ""the nurse"", punk rockers, strippers, burying bodies in the rain, chasing buxom blondes through the woods, axe murders, stabbings, disemboweling, bludgeoning, scalping, dismemberment, mutilation, and nuns.  Yeah.  That sums it all up.  Feel like the perfect Sturday night freak show?  This is the movie you are lookin' for.",1087862400,3,961,5.645833333333333
2065343,5,B00027NVX4,"This movie was very entertaining , a breath of fresh air after having to watch all these new horror films of the late 90's early 00's . Like the other reviewers have said , this is a throwback to the days when horror films were great. Being a diehard horror fan i just can't say enough good stuff about this film. Good acting, creepy characters, good story, and good effects. I highly recommend this movie to any true horror fan. Hopefully we'll start seeing more horror films like this coming out.",1087776000,3,498,4.483516483516484
2065344,3,B00027NVX4,Not exactly what I expected.  Not a high budget picture and the actors need to attend a few classes at an actor's studio if they want to become effective in any other productions.  It was not well edited and you have to fill in a lot of blanks.  However the subject matter is interesting to those who wonder what really goes on behind those embalming room doors.,1122249600,,362,4.373134328358209

2065346,4,B00027NVX4,"Talk about a totally wacked-out flick... a horror film fan friend of mine recommended this one to me and told me to be ready for a wild ride and he was right.

Bodysnatching, bizzare characters, twisted murders, revenge, necrophilia, blood, more twisted characters and more of everything.

If you are a horror flick afficianato you should check out this flick.",1099785600,5,360,4.983333333333333
2065347,4,B00027NVX4,This movie scared the crap out of me definitly worth it lots of blood and gore. Makings of a cult classic. Has a snuff movie quality about it you don't know if its real or not.,1091664000,2,176,3.9166666666666665
2065348,1,B00027NVX4,"Caution,Stay away from this film. Do not believe the 4or5 star reviews. They must be on crack. Save your money. I was a fool to believe these reviews. Now im stuck with a $22.00 piece of crap filmmaking. Just run away from this film as fast as you can.
  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!",1091145600,6,279,4.245283018867925
2065349,5,B00027NVX4,"Kudos to Alan Rowe Kelly for creating this rather sinister shocker of murder, madness and depravity! I bury you tomorrow is one of the most twisted films I've seen in awhile about a mysterious young woman who comes to the quiet town of Port Oram to work for local funeral parlor headed by Beech. Dolores Finley, the young woman has
peculiar habits like her men rather stiff and some chilling skeletons in her closet and add some grave-robbing and other sources of mayhem and you have recipe for masterpiece of the macabre! I love the memorable characters like dolores who seems quiet unassuming woman who has a suitcase full of dark secrets and who's madness which she is hiding is slowly coming back with a vengeance. Jake Gerald, the sheriff's screw-up brother who works for Beeches and who has a rather deadly job on the side, supplying fresh corpses to a businessman. Nettie Beech, a religious fanatic who sees her dead daughter in Dolores and who will do ANYTHING to keep her. The film stars out slow but not boring as you are introduced to the players in this chilling tale so when they do die (always quite bloody) LIke some of the other reviewers of this film I love the black humor of this movie. Unlike alot of shot-on video movies this one looked more professional in tone and in plot-wise miles ahead of the usual slasher genre with it's idiotic teens and unstoppable killers. What makes this film work is how makers quietly let u enter it's twisted world and you discovers all of it's gruesome
secrets. So if you want gory but well-made shocker join Dolores and Beeches and Jake Gerald and REST IN PEACE!",1089504000,9,1617,4.618055555555555
2065350,4,B00027NVX4,"Although I disagree with several reviews on some of the finer points of I'll Bury You tomorrow, I agree that it's a fun movie that is original and unique and well worth the purchase.  First off, I don't agree that's it's extremely gory at all.  Don't get me wrong, there are a handful of scenes where there is a lot of gore (done very well, I might add), but this is not the ""gore fest"" that some have proclaimed.  When it comes, you're glad it does.  I just wish there was more of it. Some think less is more.  For those lovers of EXTREME GORE, be prepared to be slightly underwhelmed.
Also, the story is indeed interesting and will keep most viewers engaged. But the good stuff takes a while to get rolling.  The buildup in the first half hooks you, and the second hour is nothing more than a free-falling locomotive quicly picking up steam.  Stick with it through the buildup...the payoff is good.  Very good.
The performances is what really makes this movie rise above the typical indie horror movie. The lead actress, Zoe Dalman-Chlanda is an amazing actress who portrays Dolores Finley, the strange newcomer to the small town of Port Oram.  The range she possesses is remarkable, on par with any ""scream queen"", I might add.  Since the story begins with her arrival into town, her gradual transformation runs parallel to the slow disintegration of the other characters as well as the complex story that frames her descent.  The story gradually introduces her rivals in the ""Body Snatching"" business, the funeral home workers Jake and his ""girlfriend"", (I think it was supposed to be his girlfriend) or maybe his drag-queen lover Corey: played wonderfully by the writer and director of the film, Alan Rowe Kelly. These two misfits are the oddest partners in crime I have seen in some time. Equal parts demented, sick, gross, and greedy. Once I got a sense what they were all about, I had a delicious time watching them lock horns with Dolores.  Wait 'til you see the switcheroo-double cross- fake out that sets all the bloodshed in motion.
The other characters in I'll Bury You Tomorrow are well written and all interesting in their own way.  Dolores decides to shack up with the Beech's,(Percival and Nettie) the owners of the funeral home.  This perverse American Gothic couple re-defines dysfunctional.  They are perfect seasoning for crackpot Delores's blood stew. Throw in the standard stock players, Ellen Gallagher(Kristen Overdurf), Tina Clark(Renee West), Eddie(P.J. Mehaffey) and Sheriff Mitch Geraldi(Jerry Murdock), you have a wonderful assortment of innocents ready to get sucked into the idling meat-grinder that is Delores.
I wish that I'll Bury You Tomorrow delivered more blood. I heard all about the bloodshed and got revved up to be bathed in it.  The effects were so good, I wanted more.  I feel some of it was held back.  But, the story and the acting was what surprised me the most. Also, be sure to read the credits closely at the end of the movie. This will offer one last surprise to make you appreciate the film even more.
Even though I was slightly disappointed by the lack of extreme gore; the haunting score, fine performances, well crafted story, and creative direction from Alan Rowe Kelly has made me a fan. Lovers of horror, make sure you seek this one out.  It's a good one.",1089244800,3,3313,4.760489510489511
2065351,4,B00027NVX4,"I would like to start off by saying that this movie is not going to be for everyone.  There are some very disturbing scenes as well as plenty of grotesque subject matter.  Some may be put off by the necrophilia and the brutal rape/incest scenes.  Personally I found them to be very brutal and hard to watch.  It seems like the director was trying very hard to push the envelope.  Maybe a little too much.  There is a lot of blood and guts as well.  Personally, I found some of it hard to watch and had to look away several times.
  However, this is still a good movie.  There is plenty going for it, though.  The characters are unique, and the acting is above average for an independent film.  The lead character, (Zoe Chlanda) is spectacular.  This is not your typical female lead.  She starts off as a meek, shy, basket case, but by the end of the film she transforms into a raving lunatic!  She really holds the movie together, since her character is the catalyst for all the carnage that takes place.  And boy, can she handle an axe!
  Bill Corry and Katherine O'Sullivan plays the creepy undertakers of the Beech Funeral home perfectly.  Perfectly screwy!  He is a fidgety man, and she a religios nut who has delusions of her dead daughter. Perfect folks to run a funeral home.  Jerry Murdock does a good job playing both Sherriff Mitch Giraldi and his scummy brother, Jake.  I didn't even know it was the same person until I saw it in the credits. A Really convincing job.  I went back and watched it again to make sure and I still don't believe it!  Alan Rowe Kelly, the director also does a great job playing Corey, the beautician in the funeral home.  All of his scenes are hilarious.  He plays the bitchy ""Divine"" party wonderfully! I didn't know whether to hug him or slap him. I just wished there were more of him.
  I guess I'll Bury You Tomorrow is more of a Black Comedy than a straight up horror movie. The situations and story are outrageous, and the evnts play out like a slow-motion train wreck.  I found myself laughing hysterically one moment, only to be ready to barf the next. It offers that much, and will entertain people looking for a ""fun"" movie and those hard core horror fans.  It's not really a date movie, though. :-)
  My main problem with it was the extreme nature of the subject matter and violence.  It was too gruesome in certain parts.  But, if you like all the blood, as well as the necrophilia, incest, rape and perversion, this might suit you. Be ready for a wild ride, but be warned about the subject matter.  It's not for everyone.",1088640000,3,2573,4.4252136752136755
2065352,5,B00027NVX4,"I love horror movies, and let me tell you, I haven't seen anything like this film in a long, long, time!  It's got that rough, indie feel, but is different because the direction, cinematography, music, and acting are all very good.  The only way to describe it would be a blend of John Water's early films mixed with something Lucio Fulci would do!  This had to have been one of the weirdest, most messed up mmovies I have seen!
The stranger (Dolores) comes into town and gets a job in a funeral home.  She looks normal, but pretty soon people in the town start getting killed off and the workers in the home are selling the bodies to this stranger on the outskirts of town.
Pretty soon, the whole plan begins to unravel and the folks in town start dropping like flies!  I didn't know if anyone would be left standing by the end of the movie!
I think this is one messed up movie. It's a bit long, but it's not boring.  It I think you'll see what I mean.  Hopefully this will not be the last of Dolores......!!",1087862400,4,1009,4.278947368421052
8023269,5,B00027NVX4,"This is a great indie movie and more should be made like them! You can read the other reviews to see what you'll get in this movie. I thought the lead did a very good job in her role as Dolores.

Overall, this was a very well made, low-budget film. I do agree, however, that the colors were washed out (I'm not sure if that was intentional, the film seems to have that ""timeless"" air to it) and the medium that it was filmed on really shows.

This film is not for people who don't like macabre, or low-budget, movies.",1231718400,,517,4.16
8023270,5,B00027NVX4,"""I'll Bury You Tommorrow"" is a great film as the story is 100% original, it's not a retelling of any other film that I am familiar with.  Allow me to steal from IMDB's plot summary and synopsis written by Alan to sum this film up in a paragraph:

Is there love after death? The small rural community of Port Oram can answer that. When deranged young Dolores Finley (Zo Daelman Chlanda) appears out of nowhere to begin work at the Beech's Funeral Home, the local mortuary soon becomes more than just a quiet place of rest. Dolores' passion for cadavers gives new meaning to the phrase ""disturbing the peace"". Written by Alan Rowe Kelly {alanrowekelly@yahoo.com

Zoe is phenomenal in her portrayal of Dolores.  The rest of the cast, including Alan in his portrayal of the mortuary's make up artist, Cory, do an incredible job at truly bringing their characters to reality.  They are all to be commended for this performance.

The use of makeup f/x with heaping helpings of gore, blood, and prosthetics truly pleased this independent horror film fan.  We have dismemberments and disembowelings.  We are treated to a strangulation of one victim with another victim's intestines.  The blood flows freely as Dolores and Jerry work their way to a decent body count.

This, folks, is the stuff Hollywood should be looking for.  Instead, they waste their money on remakes and sequels while creative geniuses like Alan, create low budget horror gems such as this. This, my friends and fans of independent horror is the stuff we should be buying and watching.  Instead of dropping ten bucks to see another tired ol' remake of another great classic in the theatre, buy this film!",1220572800,,1667,4.830985915492958
8023271,4,B00027NVX4,"Gory, bizarre, unexpected twists, TWISTED...Matricide (and Patricide) brought to a deliciously different level.  Alan Rowe Kelly obviously needs to be watched!",1217376000,,159,6.571428571428571
8023272,5,B00027NVX4,"Saw this one a while back. I see it's now been given a new release courtesy of Redemption, (in UK) but this is the one that I saw, with the eye on the cover and a 'nice' picure on the back of the dvd sleeve! ;-)
It concerns Dolores, a lady who has a penchant for hot young guys. Or in this case, they are pretty cool young guys, as in stone cold dead.
I love this movie. It is so wild and outrageous in its subject matter. There's not many movies where necrophilia is dealt with, at least not as a kind of love story. Makes me wonder if they got the idea from the wellknown (in some quarters) necrophiliac girl, Karen Greenlee. - She got jobs in an undertakers because of her 'passions' and she got found out when she stole the body of an 18 year old boy and took it home with her to sleep with and make love to for a few days, something that Dolores does in this movie, so probably it is based on that case, because the similarity is so great to what actually happened in real life. I don't agree at all with the bad review, the movie is not badly made or badly acted. It had a lovely video nasty type of feel to it, I had to check to see when it was made as I wondered at first if it was one of the banned movies from the 1980's video nasty controversy in the UK where everything got a bit mad for a while and horror fans were very hard done by indeed! But no, it's a comparatively recent movie but has that rather obscure and 'far back in time' atmosphere that some of the best of the so-called 'nasties' had. - Oh for the heady days of the video boom when there was no rating system and just about anything could get released onto an unsuspecting, but hungry for more, video market! Unfortunately, most of them passed me by as I didn't have a VCR in those days and by the time I did get one, most of the best had been banned anyway, but I've since caught up with most of them, I'm pleased to say, and some of them are pretty dire and not really worth watching and quite why they were banned in the first place is beyond my comprehension, as so many of them are very tame, (not to mention lame!) but if this had been one of them, then it would have been one of the greats, but instead, it's made long after that time, so cudos to the makers for being able to create that wonderful atmosphere of a genuine video nasty! I wish there were more like this one. It's great!",1212105600,,2370,4.033970276008493
8023273,4,B00027NVX4,"Bizarre, bloody, twisted, creepy and throughly original, IBYT is an extraordinary beginning for Alan Rowe Kelly and his crew of inde lunatics.  It is a pity the film was low-budget, but they did a lot with only a little, which is the true spirit independent film making, i.e. spitting into the eye of the Hollywood machine.
  I eagerly look forward to their next production.",1211932800,,374,4.8125
8023274,4,B00027NVX4,"We should support ultra-low-budget efforts such as this. Major kudos to Mr. Jerry Murdock for a terrific bit of acting. Writer/director/gore effects wiz Alan Rowe Kelly shows tremendous promise. You guys are going places, the talent is there.

The weaknesses, as I saw them, and it's not easy critcizing something as low-budget as this, but I feel a certain responsibility: I realize it was shot on video, still, so much of the footage looked washed out. And this was something I didn't get, because it is so easy these days to get great looking footage with just about any (relatively inexpensive) SD camcorder, etc.

Secondly: the lead who played Dolores: just awful, so weak in fact that she hurt what could have been a horror classic. This film could have used someone better suited and convincing, someone who understands that LESS IS MORE, someone who undestands that yelling does not necessarily translate as deep-rooted rage  ( there is more to it than that) someone with a degree of charisma and screen presence, etc.

It pains me to knock something that was made for next-to-nothing, still...if we are going to be helpful in any way, things ought to be pointed out: the good--as well as the other.

Lastly, the director also appears in the film as one of the characters. I say, okay, if you're someone like Eastwood, who can afford to have an army of crew people watching the actors to make sure no one steps out of frame and that things go the way they should...but when you cannot afford help of this caliber, it really isn't worth it--because your project will ultimately suffer as a result.

As I said: the guy can write, he can direct; the talent is there. Horror fans like to complain about all the remakes we are being subjected to... Well, here is something original. Get it. Rent it. Buy it. Support the indies, support hard-working creative types with solid potential like Alan Rowe Kelly and Jerry Murdock.",1178668800,2,1927,4.754491017964072
8023275,2,B00027NVX4,I wish I could give this two and a half stars because I feel like it wasn't a total waste of time.  I enjoy low budget horror films but to call this a masterpiece is going a bit too far I think.  It kept losing my attention on and off throughout whole thing.  Comparing it to the films of Dario Argento and Mario Bava is hard to swallow too.  It is what it is.  A low budget American horror flick that's only good as mindless entertainment.  I'd suggest that low-budget horror fans give it a rent and make up their own minds.,1174694400,,525,4.098039215686274
8023276,5,B00027NVX4,This movie was a masterpiece.  A real treat for Horror fans.  It copys the Italian Horror style of over the top gore but well done.  Argento and Bava would be proud.

Wow.

Not wall-to-wall psychotic gore like I was hoping but it does have it's moments like somebody being strangled with another person's intestines - haven't seen that since RICKY-OH.  The biggest drawback is the 119 minutes running time.  That's too long, trim off 20 minutes of unneeded talking, up the outrageousness and this would have been a minor cult favorite.

First time writer-director-actor-producer Alan Rowe Kelly appears to be a promising new talent in horror movies.  I can't wait to see what he does next.  Hopefully he doesn't sell out and if anything goes even more over the top.  It worked for PINK FLAMINGOS, DEAD ALIVE and EVIL DEAD 2.",1126051200,6,988,4.839285714285714
