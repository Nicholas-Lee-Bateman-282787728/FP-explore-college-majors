8174989,3,B00004U5T5,The VHS Tape on the NY Giants 1999 75th Diamond anniversary season was a short but sweet review. The Giants finished with a 7 and 9 record but brought back some memmories.,1336262400,,171,4.375
8174990,5,B00004U5T5,"Being a huge New York Giants fan, I have to admit the 2000 season was a disappointment because of the poor showing in the superbowl but a successful season by making it to the superbowl. This video is filled with highlights from the 2000 season, including the famous playoff guarantee by Jim Fassell. Also included are the big playoff wins against the Eagles and the 41-0 drubbing of the Vikings. If you're a big Giants fan like myself, I definetly recommend this video.",1045353600,,470,4.674698795180723
8174991,3,B00004U5T5,"Make sure you are getting what you really want. This video is called the 2000 Yearbook, but it is of the 1999 NFL Season. Not sure about...other NFL videos, but this one is named inappropriately. By the year 2000 rolled around, the 1999 Saints featured in this video were at home watching the playoffs!",989452800,3,302,4.611111111111111
8174992,5,B00004U5T5,"This a great video that chronicles the 1999-2000 season for NY Jets. It shows how great of a coach Bill Parcells is, bringing a team that was 1-6  back from the dead and making them respectable. I cried at the end when the  Bill Parcells Retirement Press conference was shown. A great video to add  to any sports fan's collection.",966384000,2,330,4.466666666666667
