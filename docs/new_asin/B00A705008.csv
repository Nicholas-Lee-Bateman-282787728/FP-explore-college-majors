5391763,4,B00A705008,"Seung-min is the manager of a rising star, Jin-ah. Everything goes well until Seung-min receives a clip from a sex tape involving Jin-ah on his phone. He clears up the issue, but loses his phone with the career-ending material, anyway. Now, Lee-gyu has found the phone and terrorizes Seung-min; Lee-gyu reflects his own everyday pain onto Seung-min. Handphone is an intense crime/revenge thriller.

Handphone has a great story. It packs in intense dialogue, brutal revenge, and great twists. I like how the revenge takes place in this film, since it doesn't solely rely on violence. The characters in this film are well done; for example, Lee-gyu was an amazing character, someone you can hate but also feel bad for. This leads to the question: who is the real villain? The ending of the film was brutal, and effective. I also believe this film has an important message about cell phones, but maybe I'm looking too deep: in my opinion, the film shows that cell phones may be extremely helpful, but complete cell phone dependency is a significant problem. The acting was great in this film, and so was the music. It does move at a slow pace, so it often felt like it dragged on.

Overall, Handphone is a great crime/revenge film; the first half of the film is a bit slow, but stick around for the faster 2nd half and stunning ending. As of 12/30/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is recommended.

Handphone has strong blood and violence, sex and nudity.",1358640000,3,1482,4.7587548638132295
8547610,4,B00A705008,"Almost 5 stars, but for slackness in storytelling. Like a lot of Korean films, would have benefitted greatly with 30 minutes edited out. An unappreciated Korean salesman finds the phone of a seemingly successful talent manager and decides to visit the most horrific trials upon him in a searing indictment of Korean society's slavish adherence to mor&eacute;s that drive consumer culture, technology and gender inequality. Starts out a comedy of errors, and incrementally increases the stakes through the sickening brutality of the acts committed by all concerned, with nary a person to root for by the end. Enthralling, but absolutely ruthless in it's dire reflection of soulesss Seoul, South Korea, ""Gangnam Style.""",1491523200,,717,5.410714285714286

8547619,3,B00A705008,"I am a frequent viewer of subtitled films but I found this one to be a little confusing. I am not sure if it was my fault or the film's fault, but I had to spend a little too much time trying to ""figure out"" what exactly was happening. Maybe I was not paying enough attention or maybe it was just naturally confusing. Not sure. The plot is about a cell phone that falls into the wrong hands and the efforts a man makes to get it back. Requires maybe a little too much suspension of disbelief but overall entertaining. It was very well acted, tense and quite violent at times. There are a some twists in the plot that definitely leave you guessing as to how things are going to come out. I recommend for fans of this Korean genre but it isn't for everyone.",1372723200,2,755,4.178082191780822
