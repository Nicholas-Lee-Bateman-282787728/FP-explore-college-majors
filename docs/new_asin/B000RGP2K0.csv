8404618,5,B000RGP2K0,"This video was only sold on tv locally in the North Texas area. It features the Von Erich family, not long after Davids death, intro-ing each others segements. Basicaly starts with Fritz and works its way down by age.... Kevin, David, Kerry, and then Mike. Each segment features a little background The Von Erichs individually and then shows a match before moving on to the next one. I would give most of the matches a medium caliber rating though. But it is still thoroughly entertaining overall. It is probably the single best source for un-WWE'd footage of the Von Erichs. This video and the 6 volumes of the Best Of WCCW... were the only officially released videos while the promotion was still operating. The 6 volume Best Of series was available in retail outlets. But Front Row Ringside was a tv offer only video. This video is a true piece of Texas Wrestling history. David was gone by this point, but the Von Erichs were still North Texas royalty at the time this video was produced. I also believe much of the match footage in this video was not part of what was sold to the WWE. Kevin only sold them the sindicated stuff that aired on ch. 39 in Dallas. I think what is being lost in the re-writing of history... is that there were what could have been considered two simultaneous promotions going in Dallas/Ft. Worth. There were the ch. 39 shows shot at the Sportatorium in Dallas... which is what the WWE bought. But also a local only show called Saturday Night Wrestling(which did eventually get syndicated on CBN). The show aired the Dallas independent station ch. 11 KTTV. Both shows featured the same talent for the most part. The ch. 11 shows were shot in Ft. Worth at several venues located around the stock yards in downtown, and dates back much further than the WCCW(ch. 39) stuff. And from what I understand... none of that footage was sold to the WWE. I grew up the D/FW area and was a huge wrestling fan as a kid in the 70's and 80's. For those that were fans of that era, I would highly recommend this video.",1261872000,2,2032,4.509485094850948
