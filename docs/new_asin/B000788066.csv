8196429,5,B000788066,"Some might say the plot line in this movie is unrealistic, too improbable, even silly.  Well, so?  That just didn't seem to bother me and on the whole I loved the movie.  It has the best boy meets girl scene you'll ever find, set to Groove Armada's ""Hands of Time.""",1221264000,,265,4.26
