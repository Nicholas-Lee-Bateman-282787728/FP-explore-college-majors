It does, in fact, focus on the main character who is indeed letting life pass him by as he does... nothing. But that's the whole point of the movie! To draw you into this young man's life and maybe understand just why he feels powerless over the things that happen to him, and how by meeting this lovely young woman who seems to show (gasp!) an interest in him, he slowly starts to ""wake up"" and realize that he can indeed change his life and make it better, that he has the power to do so, and by the end of the film, he's well on his way to his new and joyful life. It shows how you sometimes have to leave things behind in order to grow and make your life one worth living. Yes, this movie has some slow moments, but that's the overall feeling of the main character's life, and the movie must reflect that. Again, I thought this movie is brilliant and I wish more people knew about it and could appreciate it.",1312588800,13,990,4.18848167539267
7945884,5,B00005MM6T,"This is a movie that sticks with you. I had no idea who the actors were when I started, but I recognized Shelley Winters' voice immediately. She was such a good actress. I was happy to see that Victor survived his grief, as did his mom's dog! They had a sweet scene together.",1524528000,,275,4.2075471698113205
7945885,5,B00005MM6T,"I wish I had seen this movie a long time ago.  This is a great movie by James Mangold that I will definitely keep in my DVD collection.  Heavy is a very slow, but good drama.  Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is a very overweight middle aged man who also has a lot of mental health issues and is also extremely lonely.  He is a cook at a roadside restaurant that him and his mom run.  One day a very gorgeous girl named Callie (Liv Tyler) comes in for a job and Victor immediately falls in love with her.  (Who wouldn't?!) Victor wants to be a really good cook/chef, but knows he can't afford to go and pursue it, so, he goes back to his old daily routine he has done his whole life.  Victor is a super sweet guy even with all his problems.  One day tragedy strikes, but he doesn't tell anybody what happened.  He is extremely crushed, but the only person he will tell is Callie.  Callie is also extremely crushed by what has happened and decides that she wants to quit the diner and go back to school.  Victor and Callie decide to leave things on good terms as Callie leaves.  Victor has a hard time coming to grasp with everything that's happened, but one day he accepts everything and moves on like we all do.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves a good drama.  The acting is absolutely superb by everybody and this movie deserves nothing less than 5 stars!",1510099200,,1370,4.280155642023346

7945888,3,B00005MM6T,"I like Liv Tyler but to me, the movie was slow. I don't think the movie revolved around one being over-weight. I think it had many insecure characters in it.",1443312000,,157,4.266666666666667
7945889,5,B00005MM6T,"I saw this movie when it was first released and I was so captivated by it, I waited until I could get a DVD copy and have since watched it several times.  This movie does move slowly, just like life in the Hudson River Valley, where the film takes place.  This is an intense look into a mediocre life, but like everyone's mediocre life, it has complexity, grace and depth.  The acting was exceptional, particularly Tyler and Debra Harry, who has so much potential its painful.  If you like an intellectual thoughtful film, this one is great.  Don't expect Hollywood happy endings or character development that makes you feel good that all ends well, this is a film about real life, the life of someone you would easily walk by in the grocery store without a thought, but once you see inside his life, you see that there is something interesting and even wonderful about even the most obscure people you see every day.",1417046400,4,917,4.567073170731708
7945890,5,B00005MM6T,"I loved this movie so much. Debbie Harry had been long forgotten (despite her resurgence) when this movie came out, it was a shock to recognize her and a thrill to see her throw herself into this dumpy role as though she lived it, hell all the actors (minus Evan Dando, who is generally terrible) give phenomenal performances. A beautifully slow movie. An underground classic.",1414972800,4,376,4.8
