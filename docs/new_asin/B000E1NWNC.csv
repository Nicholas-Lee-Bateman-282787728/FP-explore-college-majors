2480074,5,B000E1NWNC,"This movie is a must watch for everyone, but especially for those who live in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I recognized a lot of the beautiful local scenery in the movie.

""The Californians"" humourously depicts the dicotomy that occurs when the hippie-spirit meets capitalism.  Besides humor, there is an undercurrent of romance and beauty that is characteristic of beautiful Northern California.  The images from this movie will stay with you.",1142208000,4,444,5.211267605633803

2480131,5,B000E1NWNC,"We live in Northern California and live this movie everyday! It is so very true to the reality of this crazy melting pot. More than that, though, I love the core message of the movie: Although it pits Hippies/New Agers/Enviro-Tree Huggers vs. Greedy Developer/Big Business Corporate Moneyhounds, the two main characters show that with a little understanding and love, we can find a solution that works for everyone!",1418860800,,415,5.117647058823529
2480132,1,B000E1NWNC,"TERRIBLE.  Did not make it through the entire film.  Great cast, but man, it was awful.  Expected more from it.",1386720000,,111,4.45
2480133,5,B000E1NWNC,"I enjoyed this film and its mix of music, romance, and comedy.  Delightful Kara Mara is the star of this one.  In addition to being to a short escape to a fictional world in coastal California, the film carries some messages about ecology and activism.  The housing declines post 2008 provide another angle for this film.

The movie provides some levity to the often contentious real-world nature of activism and protests.  For people who have years of activism and protests under their belts, this movie is a nice reminder of the spirit and fun of why one started in the first place.",1386460800,,584,4.686274509803922
2480134,2,B000E1NWNC,"The updated concept and story deserves four stars.  Transporting Henry James' ""The Bostonians"" to contemporary real estate  crazy California was a smart move, and demonstrates how James' tale was one for the ages. The scriptwriters obviously did their homework, and it wasn't much of a leap to transform spiritualist Verena Tarrant into Zoe Tripp, the folk-singing daughter of hippies. In the original novel, Verena had spent time as a girl living on communes that practiced ""free love"" so the contemporary twist on the character was perfect.  Also, this film retains the biting satiric edge of the novel, something the rather straighforward and humorless 1984 film adaptation of ""The Bostonians"" failed to do.  The script even allows us to get a sense of the final ""far from brilliant"" pairing of two of the leads.

The problem with this movie is the central casting. Ileana Douglas is a wonderful actress, but the part of the dour, difficult Olive is underwritten and Douglas is unable to fully bring her to life.  (It's notoriously hard to make Olive likeable as she is cold even in the novel.) Noah Wyle and the beautiful Kate Mara (who performs the songs herself) have very little chemistry and their arrival at a mutual understanding isn't convincing.

The smaller roles fare better, with the always great Cloris Leachman in the Eileen Boatwright/Miss Birdseye role,  (Leachman brings to life the woman ""whose charity began at home and ended nowhere"") and Keith Carradine as Zoe's father and mentor. Valerie Perrine, looking radiant, pops up out of nowhere in the small role of Zoe's mother, leading me to wonder where she's been all these years.

Worth the rental but won't be a classic.",1144022400,6,1694,5.0
8103951,5,B000E1NWNC,"Henry James, The Bostonians?!  Please read this great work of literature to understand the themes more deeply.  (Fyi, James is one of the finest American writers.  Please read him.  Just put the
book in a brown cover to protect yourself from wild accusations of so-called white privelege. )",1498348800,,290,4.979166666666667

8103953,4,B000E1NWNC,"Interesting that this film was made at the height of the Surreal Estate Bubble in 2006 created by criminal theft of the rightful incomes of elderly interest income dependent retired for the benefit of frauds and thieves selling ""homes"" to people who couldn't conceivably afford the mortgages.  Olive was a typical example of those who pretend to be saving the environment while criminally attacking not only the humans they oppose but often the environment itself.  Meanwhile Gavin totally identified his *self* with the processes in which he was engaged before being foreclosed upon.  For the younger than either of them Zoe to understand let alone choose between their diametrically opposed strategies of the brother/sister pair seemed improbable.  Yet Zoe's interest in nature reformed Gavin's process orientation and even Olive managed to start speaking for herself instead of abusing a young human voice to sell her negative message.  The film actually had little to do with the title state which is so criminally corrupt with felony tax evading ""religion"" gangs that it bankrupts its cities and towns for the purpose of supporting slave mongering, hate mongering against male citizens subversions of human and civil rights.  But it was a beautiful story of conflicting value systems and how one young person dealt with them.",1476662400,,1330,5.25
