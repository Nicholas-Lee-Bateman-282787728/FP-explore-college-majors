1421355,1,B00005B6JU,"This dvd looks like one of those versions you would find in a .99 cent store. If you are a Fraidy cat fan and want an official and nice picture/sound version the only one I seen is on the Frightfully Funny Collection Volume 2. Just do an Amazon dvd search and it'll come up. It's still for sale but could go out of print at any time. You also get 2 more discs, one of Groovie Goolies and Ghostbusters, two other filmation shows.",1294704000,,428,4.168674698795181
1421356,3,B00005B6JU,"I bought this DVD hoping that it was an old TV show I remember, and it was! Yay!
Finding info on this title was near impossible. IMDB has it listed incorrectly as a TOM & JERRY episode that has the same title.
This DVD is actually 4-5 episodes of the 1970's animated TV series FRAIDY CAT by Filmation Studios. Only the FILMATION logo at the beginning is missing. The disc also includes a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon as a bonus.
The picture quality is pretty bad, as with all the other DVD released by this company (very very grainy, lots of VHS to DVD transfer errors, etc), but considering how hard it is to locate the majority of Filmation's cartoon library these days, I cant really complain, some is better than none!
IF you are looking for RARE 1970's cartoons, and don't mind the bad transfer, then grab this Filmation classic, otherwise, stick with the tons of Disney fare available on DVD.",1011312000,13,903,4.54601226993865
