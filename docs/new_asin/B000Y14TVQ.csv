3010732,4,B000Y14TVQ,My sister and I saw it on line and liked it enough to buy a copy of the seres. We liked it just as well the second time through.,1317254400,,128,3.4482758620689653
3010733,5,B000Y14TVQ,"I liked everything about this. I'm usually hesitant buying anime on the 'net because some might be fake, but this is the legit DVD set. I'm happy with my purchase, and I highly recomment buying this. Pretty low price too.",1287532800,,221,4.55
3010734,5,B000Y14TVQ,"I bought this series quite a while ago and just now finished watching it. Have you ever gone to a party and nothing really was happening , so you left to go to another party ,only to find out later that the first party turned out to be ' the party of the year'? That's the comparison I have about Kiddy Grade . I watched the first 3 discs and they were good but they didn't have that 'Wow factor' that keeps you rooted to the screen. So the other day I grabbed  the box off the shelf and inserted disc 4 . Thats when I realized I had 'left the party ' too soon.
  The first 3 discs are good , giving insight about the girls personalities and the various missions they are sent on , the introduction of other GOTT teams and also hinting that something is amiss behind the scenes at the GU and GOTT. Disc 4 is really where the show takes off. All the missions the girls were sent on were just small pieces to a large picture and also giving the back story of Eclair and Lumiere.
  The characters I liked from the beginning . They couldn't be more completely opposite , Lumiere is the epitome of a refined elegant lady and despite appearing to be much younger than Eclair ,she is more level headed and sensible. Eclair is more of a free spirit who sometimes lets her emotions overrule her orders , she's not afraid to go out in public dressed sloppily or picking up a piece of dropped food and eating it , much to the chagrin of Lumiere who points out she should act more elegantly.
 So if you want a great series at a great price , then Kiddy Grade fits the bill. The last 5 discs more than make up for the pacing of the first 3. The characters are as diverse as any cast I've ever seen , with each GOTT team having distinct personalities and powers.
 One of the extras on the discs are portfolios of the Gott teams outlining their personalities , their powers and equipment.
 Trust me on this one Kiddy Grade is a great show and a great value that you should pick up.",1280620800,4,1966,4.155263157894737

Fast paced, a petty well thought out storyline, a decent ending (so many Anime's have odd or unfullfilling endings), cute in places and even a little sexy in others, sure the old girls with guns idea but more thought out than that, and a good bit of humor thrown in.",1272585600,,592,4.342342342342342

3010738,4,B000Y14TVQ,"I used to have the individual 8 dvds for the series. A friend of mine had never been able to finish the series, so for her birthday,  I gave her mine, and decided to, because of the cover work for this box set. I've been looking around on line and have yet to see that illustration from KG. It is quite eye catching. When I saw this box set, I thought, oh good! They came out with a newer complete box set. I bought it for a really good price on Amazon from a third party seller that had a fulfillment with Amazon. When it came in, I was so excited, but after opening it I was slightly disappointed. The box set itself is laid out like so. There is a flimsy thin like card board slip cover, that might I say, bends easily. One of the side panels was bent and now has a crease on one side. It slides off, more than easily if I may say. To reveal a book design, with slip cover pages that all 8 dvds slide into. Securely and safely. That is pretty much the box set's set up. Nice artwork is demonstrated throughout the design, and its easy to manage the dvds in the slip pages. But what really got me disappointed was the slip cover, how it doesn't really fit that well on the book, and how flimsy it is and rather fragile. Not that I'm going to be throwing it around or doing anything out of the ordinary with it, but I will say it could have been designed better in the sturdy department.

Maybe I just got a bad one, and others have gotten better. But this was my personal experience. If you're going to buy this box set, I would recommend seeing it in store, so you know what you're getting.",1250380800,5,1593,4.086261980830671

3010740,5,B000Y14TVQ,"I first came across Kiddy Grade on TV. I thought it was really cool. I think that both genders should like watching this series. The graphics are good, the picture clear and the sound is grate. There is a total of 24 episodes, English and Japanese languages and the usual kind of extras. This is a sci-fi anime with very cool fight scenes, drama, suspense a good story line and some pretty neat robots. The story revolves around clair and Lumiere who are ES Force members of the Global Union, a shadow force that serves as the primary law enforcement for the Galaxy. clair and Lumiere go through quite a few exciting adventures and through out them you'll fall in love with both characters. clair begins to remember bits and pieces from her past and during a tedious mission the situation escalates to the point where clair can't take anymore and losses it which results in her and her partner being hunted down by their fellow Es members some of whom where friends. This series has a good ending; it's funny, sad, and exciting all at once. You won't regret buying the Viridian Collection. This is truly a great show. NOTE: I wouldn't recommend this series for anyone under the age of 16. There isn't any bad language but there is some adult humor and suggestive scene like the clothing the girls are wearing etc.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samurai-7-Box-Set-Viridian-Collection/dp/B0018RCN54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samurai 7: Box Set (Viridian Collection)</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spiral-The-Complete-Series-The-Viridian-Collection/dp/B000QQ9SRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spiral - The Complete Series (The Viridian Collection)</a>",1224201600,19,1732,5.849802371541502

I will say this to others considering this series, it starts slow.  The first 8 episodes are pretty much self contained (or appear that way), action story of the day.  They are also unfortunately filled with fan service (as our heroines are rather scantily clad and there are plenty of panty shots).  Nevertheless, I'm still recommending this series.  If you stick with it, you will be rewarded with an overarching plot that starts to open up at around episode 8.  It'll make you knit your brow and want to watch ""just one more episode"" so you can find out what the blink is going on.  Episode 11 smashes things wide open.  I felt like I was watching an old Twilight Zone episode.  It was full of dark irony that made me queasy when I realized what the long term consequences of our heroine's actions not only to herself, but to the planet she was on.

I have a feeling that fanservice must not be as much of a negative for the Japanese as for the USA.  Perhaps the director felt like it was needed to keep people watching the early episodes before the plot really took off.  I have no idea, but the twists and turns going on now are making this series a thrilling ride.  ...and I'm now used to scanty uniforms and panty shots so I don't even notice it any more.  hahahaha!",1338336000,7,1457,4.328413284132841

8230576,2,B000Y14TVQ,"After watching the 5 out of 5 (review) trailer of kiddy grade, no doubt i had high expectations of this anime. Saddly i couldn't get passed the 6th episode, i kept watching in hopes it would get better but eventually i had to thow in the towel. There are very few animes ive come across that i actually couldn't finish watching because they where just so dull, this is one of them. The only reason i gave this anime 2 stars is because the main character is always flashing her underwear, but thats hardly a reason to view kiddy grade. This is a great cartoon for babies, but a huge failure in my opinion for adult viewers, there is no real violence or drama displayed. In one scene in episode 5, the main character breaks the cock pit of a jet, and throws the pilot out in mid air. When im FINALLY thinking im viewing a scene of violence, the producers made damn sure the audience views the pilot pulling out and using his parachute to ensure no real harm was caused to the bad guy pilot. A great way to describe kiddy grade is, well it feels like its an anime from the 60's or 70's. Yes there is light nudity like the animes back then, but like most animes 5, 6 decades ago, they failed to ""hook in "" their viewers. To sum up my overall review, this anime is too childish and boring,  its much too tv friendly... i mean come on the main character's only weapon is a magic lipstic.",1510617600,,1381,4.231060606060606

8230579,5,B000Y14TVQ,"A hidden gem of an anime!  Short and concise at 23 episodes.  A great story with great art, cool sleek designs, and decent superhero sci-fi concepts.  I found it a bit heavy on the fan service, though the ""panty shots"" were minimal compared with some anime productions out there.  I'm no prude, but I felt the fan service was unnecessary for a story of this kind.  Remarkably, this show deals with some metaphysical concepts, such as karma and reincarnation (albeit with a science-fiction explanation over a spiritual one), as well as overcoming one's deep regrets and bitterness.  The only downside to this show would be that certain aspects of the world building and characters' origins are never explained concretely.  That being said, check it out people . . .",1474416000,,764,4.875968992248062
