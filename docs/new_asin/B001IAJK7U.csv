8310569,3,B001IAJK7U,"This film is engaging but nowhere near as good as Glam. It suffered from not having Josh Evans as the composer this time around. Dick Van Patten and Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and Papas fame give great acting performances as does rapper Sticky Fingaz. There are some gorgeous shots of landscapes in this movie. The cinematography is pristine. The dialogue at times is thought provoking. The negatives are the story is quite poor compared to Glam. The conclusion also was not as rewarding as it should have been but all in all, it is a decent film.",1512345600,,551,4.63265306122449
