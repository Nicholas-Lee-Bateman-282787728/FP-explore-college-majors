The videos introduce the children to topics that the teacher talks and teaches about and gives them music to remember it by. There are so many cartoons out that children don't want to see another cartoon video but with kidsongs kids, they are real children their age. Wonderful tool for a classroom teacher.",1152748800,,480,4.795180722891566
7980082,5,B00008974Y,"I first bought Kidsongs videos for my older boys, who are now 15 and 13.  I had another child 2 years ago and started searching for the Kidsongs titles - I have since bought almost all of them on dvd - the old ones we had on vhs and have since passed along to friends and family. My two year old LOVES the Kidsongs as much as my older boys did.  They never really watched cartoons on video and these have real animals and children along with music - they are great!!",1140739200,3,466,4.054347826086956
