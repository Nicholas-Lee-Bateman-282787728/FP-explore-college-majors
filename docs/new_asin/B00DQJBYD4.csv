8596342,5,B00DQJBYD4,"Nicotine Stains is much more than a standard horror, with blended elements of surrealism, minimalism and  atmospheric grandeur, it is more like a modern grand guignol. The story, once you realize the nature of the lead characters psychosis, seems almost laughable but it expresses the depth of struggle he has with quitting smoking. As someone who did quite, I can attest to the mind producing some pretty far out thoughts about the people around you, and all the reasons not to quit: like if you quit then you will just be giving in to social demands or if I didn't date you then I wouldnt be forced to quit. This movie carries that theme to the ninth level of hell. There are several film styles utilized in Nicotine Stains but it is at its core a well directed modern horror film. More cult classic than you expect going into the film.

The most notable qualities about Nicotine Stains that worked for this film were, the sound track-classic 80s giallo sounds of creepiness, The use of various colors to express different heightened emotional moments in the film- very Argento-esque but the gore sets it off! It holds up to more classic grindhouse horror films of splatter,guts and gruesome vivacity. The acting in the film has its moments that seem mediocre but not to the point it makes it hard to connect with the characters. For the most part the acting is quality. The story, all though based in a very exaggerated beginning, is fresh and very modern-most of us have been that person trying to quit, or dealing with someone who is trying to quit. It always seems to consume everything about the relationships and environment. The only downside to the film dealt with the synthetic nicotine. It was only casually mentioned once, maybe twice and it would have been nice to see that element played up more in the story. It didn't really hurt the film that it wasn't I just think it would have been cool to see it driven in more. The horror in this film is more of visual gore than scary.",1432598400,,1992,4.608450704225352

As the mother of the writer/producer/director, you already know some of the reasons I love this film. I want to tell you some that you don't know. Matt Fowler is mesmerizing in this, his first feature as the lead actor. Don McCutcheon as Roger the mean boss is wonderful and engaging and not at all mean in real life! Lacy Wetmore, the female lead,  is 100% immersed in the role and makes it look easy. Chelsea Collins, who has also acted in one of Gennaro Desposito's student films is creepy in all the right places. This entire cast and crew was committed and professional while having fun with the story and it shows. Chris Ehling and Kyle Duncan Graham, Renee Sher and Sunny Williams all put in a stellar effort which pays off in spades. The wonderful crew needs mention here, too. AP Megan Powers, indie and horror veteran, went above and beyond to make this production special. I don't ever want to see a Gennaro Desposito film that she doesn't lend her magic to. Cinematographer Graham Robbins created a dissonant but authentic feel for the entire film. Ian Flux, Composer and Valentin El Musico created a score that set the feel for this film perfectly and I always make sure I never listen to the soundtrack in the dark! All special effects were accomplished the old-fashioned way and makeup artist Kelsey Boutte's craft is evident in every scene. Kimberly Desposito is really the unsung hero of the movie, so I'll sing a little about her here... every costume, every prop and every scene was dressed with Kimmy's quirky, humorous and unique sense of style and she really delivers. L Alan Huerta and Megan Powers were the sound mixers on this one and between their mastery and the cinematography, just the right environment was created for a story I could never have predicted could come from my son. I knew some of what was coming and I still gasped in all the right places! If you love horror and independent film, get your horror on with Nicotine Stains!",1377043200,,2129,4.602631578947369
8596344,5,B00DQJBYD4,"This is Gennaro Desposito first full length feature. Nicotine Stains is described as being in the same vein as Maniac, Combat Shock and How To Get Ahead In Advertising by the director Gennaro Desposito. For me he succeeded for the most part.

Even though going by the trailer I knew I would like this it really surprised me at how much I ended up getting into this. I was glued to the screen the whole time and felt I had discovered a movie I felt I would want to re~watch again and again.

What we have here is a man who falls into a catalyst that triggers off an old mental disorder that he had under control through medication. Even though the IMDb page states Bipolar I feel he was schizophrenic due to what happens. There was no sadness but aggression along with voices he hears. Actor Matt Fowler does a great job with this role. For me he had the eyes for this if that makes sense to my reader. He could articulate with them and it was effective.

Naturally this being a horror movie there are kills. These are done very well. Aggressively Charlie does his thing and it feels right. Along with this we get some nice juicy gore as well with chopped up body parts and some intestine action.

My only real negative here is that with one of the kills wish it was more graphic. It is perfectly executed in the it actually made me cringe but we don't get to see what I will term as the juicy bit. Just feel it is a shame that it was never shown. Not to spoil to much the same kind of kill is depicted in Irreversible and Drive to name two to great effect. But then maybe the crew felt they couldn't do justice to the effect so decided to keep it to people's imaginations which is fair enough.

Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forwards to any other full length features Gennaro Desposito does in the future.",1376006400,2,1822,4.284883720930233
