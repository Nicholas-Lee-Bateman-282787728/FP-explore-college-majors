This documentary is also beautifully shot and spans the history of the Knights of Malta from inception to present day. The filming of Malta itself and the history it has makes one desireous to go there just to see and experience the country.

 I was unaware of a lot of the history of the KOM but completely ignorant of their present day standing in society. This is a very fascinating documentary and highly recommended. You will see a lot of work went into making this peice.

  The DVD also comes with another documentary on the armor of the day. I have yet to view this but I perceive it will be also very informative and detailed in its display of the history of the armor worn by these courageous KOM.

 One very interesting note is how the Knights fell from grace so to speak each time they became affluent and politically powerful. They became decadent and they fell. History is doomed to repeat itself if we don't heed its warnings.

  I would have given this documentary 5 stars except I found the historical re-enactments redundant and not very realistic. I am sure its do to the budget that any substantial re-enactments would cost would be financially prohibited. GOD bless JB",1139097600,18,1286,4.6255506607929515
