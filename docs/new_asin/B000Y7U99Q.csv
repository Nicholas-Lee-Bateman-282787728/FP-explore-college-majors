I always wondered how volatile things actually were in certain cities and as with any crisis, situations bring out the best and worst of people. Blackout's well-written script and characterization of the community really provided a 'true-to-life' story of the 7 state blackout of 2003. But then again, any production that includes such talented actors as Jeffrey Wright, veterans Melvin Van Pebbles, LaTanya Richardson and Saul Rubinek would predictably see honest portrayals of native New Yorkers.  However, each actor in this indie production certainly carried their weight resulting in a well-crafted movie that offers a convincing tale to an otherwise brief dark sport in U.S. city.",1205625600,3,828,5.2727272727272725
3012038,4,B000Y7U99Q,"I watched this movie to see what happened to other people in New York during the blackout. My experience definitely wasn't negative. I liked this movie because it opened up my mind to what other people had went through on that day, and since I know flatbush pretty well, I could believe that all this happened. Jamie Hector is definitely an actor that people should watch out for. And if anyone is familiar with The Wire HBO series they know he is a good actor. I recommend this to anyone who lived in New York at the time of the blackout, sad that this was not a major release.",1202169600,,578,4.3119266055045875

8231028,5,B000Y7U99Q,"Blackout turned out to be a solid movie experience. I popped it in my DVD player, expecting low budget type quality and painful acting. To my surprise, I was glued to the TV and found myself shedding a tear or two in some parts. If you are into Sci-Fi, this movie is an urban reminiscent of the Twilight Zone's Monsters Are Due on Maple Street. That's the most I can give you without completely giving away the plot.

To the reviewer who said that this movie was doing too much in too little time, I totally disagree. The acting was very engaging from the start, and very similar to the movie Crash in terms of numerous subplots with the characters. However, it was easy to follow and highly relatable, especially if you are a native New Yorker. Watch the movie!!",1254528000,5,763,4.45
8231029,5,B000Y7U99Q,"I t is sad to see a group of people broaden there personality at expence of some elses life. This story reminds me of how fragil our lives can be when the unexpected happens around a ""quick"" to think atmosphere and individuals. With no remorse! A MUST SEE",1229904000,,255,4.333333333333333
