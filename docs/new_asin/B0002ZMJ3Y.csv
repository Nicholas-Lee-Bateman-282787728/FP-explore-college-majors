The fight scenes in this feature is incredible. Sonny chiba fights some of the most top fighters in this film. The action fights are well directed. The backdrops in this film is spectacular. I have to always commend on sonny chiba's acting abilities. Sonny really shows the audience true emotion besides fighting.

If you have not seen this film,and don't know what it is about let me share a little note on what this film summerizes. As you know,if you have been keeping up with the series of oyama, then you know that he has a history of beating karate fighters up, and also luckly beating a live bull. The story basically kicks off when oyama decides to give up karate, and become a bouncer for a old time buddy. When things went sour, he quits and flees to the county side where he gets involved in a boys abbusive life stlye. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the young boys father gets hurt bad on the job, and has no mediacal insurance. Oyama is asked by some underground thugs to fight a live bear. If oyama wins, he receives big money and can use that money to pay the medical bill.

When oyama succesfully beats the bear, he is then given an invitation to fight a karate fighter seeking revenge on him. The karate figher's brother however was paralyze by oyama in a fight before he fleed to the country.

The last fight is kind of short but it is good. I recomend you get this film. If you have not seen or ever watched the oyama trilogy, by all means check this one out. Also, the picture quality put out by adness is top notch. Great widescreen remastering.",1197331200,,1791,4.434650455927052

Not Fiction movie like this one, may be 10% based on true Mas Oyama's life. He deserve to have a better, REAL biography film. The korean film ""Fighter in the Wind"" is another one that I did not like since it is not an accurate biography. It has too much of a prejudice view by the Koreans. Mas Oyama only konws the true story.....It is BEST to read a book written by Mas Oyama himself, rather than watching fiction entertaiment movies. OSU~!",1106697600,2,605,4.315789473684211

8035318,4,B0002ZMJ3Y,"This is the second installment of the Oyama series starring Sonny Chiba. The series is loosely based on the life of Chiba's mentor, Masutatsu Oyama. This time he briefly works for a small time mobster as his bodyguard and has to fight a bear to help a kid pay his father's medical bills. As with most Toei produced movies of the 70's the picture quality is beautiful. When i bought this dvd, the scene i was most worried about was the scene in which Sonny had to fight a bear which imo (for a low budget movie) didn't look as phony as i thought it would be. When i read the liner notes by Patrick Macias, I was alittle worried. He didn't exactly praise the movie. I enjoyed the movie alot and am glad i bought it. My only disappointment was the final fight scene between Sonny and the headmaster of the karate school was a bit too short. Other than that the movie has alot of action and is enjoyable even if it is a bit predictable. The dvd soundtrack is in 2.0 and 5.1 japanese only for purists who hate dubbed english. It does have english subtittles though. The extras are trailers of other Sonny Chiba movies. For the price it's a good investment.",1411516800,,1151,4.333333333333333
8035319,5,B0002ZMJ3Y,"Another Mass Oyama film, don't care for him or his style but I have to have all Sonny Chiba films, not all are great and remember it is mostly in 70's so some times a bit cheesy. You cant bet it for the price.",1395100800,,209,3.772727272727273
8035320,5,B0002ZMJ3Y,"If you are a fan of the one and only Sonny Chiba, then I suggest you add this to your collection of Sonny Chiba movies. This movie has everything you would expect from a Sonny Chiba movie. Action and more action. I am a Sonny Chiba fan and I would recommend this and just about anything else Sonny Chiba did to any fan of Grindhouse action movies. Two Thumbs Way Up!!!!!!!!!!",1335052800,,375,4.295774647887324
