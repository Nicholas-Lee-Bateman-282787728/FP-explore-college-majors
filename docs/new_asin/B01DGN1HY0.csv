Amazon is calling this the ""UK Edition"", but that just means that these are the uncut episodes as shown on British television.
This is the official North American Blu-Ray/DVD release of Endeavour Season Three,
so you should have no playback difficulties in North America,
and you won't need a region-free DVD/Blu-Ray player (however desirable those are)

WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH ENDEAVOUR ON BLU-RAY, NOT PBS:
I always knew Masterpiece Mystery broadcasts on PBS were edited, but was I was surprised to learn exactly how much was cut.
An average of ten minutes per episode.
The new Blu-Ray/DVD contains the uncut British version.
Episode One ""Ride"" was 1:22:38 on PBS (not counting the closing credits).
The unedited ITV (UK) version is 1:31:55 on Blu-Ray (not counting the closing credits).
Eleven per cent of the show never made it to PBS.
Four Episodes with an average running time of 1 hour, 32 minutes = ""Ride"", ""Arcadia"", ""Prey"", ""Coda""
Widescreen picture.
English SDH subtitles.

Extras:
-- The Making of Season Three (10 minutes)
-- Interview with Shaun Evans - Constable Endeavour Morse (5 minutes)
-- Interview with Roger Allam - Inspector Fred Thursday (5 minutes)

OBSERVATIONS ON SEASON THREE
I was a bit uncomfortable with Seasons One and Two.
It was hard to see how the brilliant Inspector Morse would evolve from the pathologically timid Constable Endeavour Morse.
Inspector Morse was awkward in social situations, but confident in his ability to solve crimes.
Inspector Morse went out of his way to show off his knowledge of music and literature.
Constable Morse seems to be embarrassed by his Oxford education.

Constable Morse is finally coming around.
The turning point seems to be the time he spent in prison following Season Two, accused of corruption and attempted murder.
This would make a great series in itself:
""Morse: The Prison Years"" (okay, months)
When he got out, the first thing he did was drop the ""Endeavour"".
Now he insists on being addressed as ""Morse"".
[I never could understand this - My parents named me ""John"" - I'd much prefer ""Endeavour""]
Season Three ends with Morse taking the Sergeant's Exam.
Definite progress.

The best new character in Season Three is WPC Trewlove (wonderful name).
[WPC = Women's Police Constable]
Played by Dakota Blue Richards (wonderful name)
Morse seems to be showing an interest (she's almost as smart as he is).

Best old character in Season Three is Superintendent Reginald Bright (played by Anton Lesser).
Previously he was just an unpleasant time-server, but Superintendent Bright is transformed in the final two episodes
(possibly through the charms of WPC Trewlove).

RECURRING CHARACTERS [IN MORE THAN ONE SERIES]
The Morse franchise begins in 1965 with our introduction to Constable Endeavour Morse and ends in 2016 with Inspector Lewis heading off to New Zealand.
A surprising number of characters who we meet in Endeavour turn up again on Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis.
P.C. = Police Constable (uniform) / D.C. = Detective Constable (mufti)
P.S. = Police Sergeant / D.S. = Detective Sergeant
P.I. = Police Inspector / D.I. = Detective Inspector

P.C./D.S./D.I./SUPERINTENDENT JIM STRANGE (photo 4)
1965-1987: Jim Strange is D.C. Morse's best friend at the Cowley City Police Station (Oxford City Police).
First appearance: Endeavour Season One, Episode One (played by Sean Rigby)
P.C. Strange is later promoted to Detective Sergeant ahead of Morse, which puts a bit of a strain on their relationship.
Presumably he will also be promoted to Inspector, because by
1987-2000: He is CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT STRANGE, once again promoted ahead of Morse.
Still Inspector Morse's best friend on the force.
Still calls Morse ""Matey"".
Chief Superintendent for all 33 episodes of Morse (played by James Grout)

DR. MAX DeBRYN (photo 5)
1965-1987: Home Office Pathologist assigned to the Oxford City Police.
First appearance: Endeavour Pilot (played by James Bradshaw)
1987-1988: Dr. DeBryn appeared in the first seven Morse episodes, retiring at the end of Season Two (played by Peter Woodthorpe)
He was replaced by Dr. Grayling Russell (Amanda Hillwood) for one season, and eventually by Dr. Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) who finished out the Morse series and stuck around for all 33 episodes of Lewis.

PHILIP HATHAWAY (photos 6,7)
1967: Constable Endeavour Morse investigates a series of suspicious deaths at Crevecoeur Hall, home of the incredibly wealthy Mortmaigne family.
Philip Hathaway, the Mortmaigne family gardener, is one of the suspects (played by Rob Callender)
First appearance: Endeavour Season Three, Episode Three (""Prey"").
2010: There is another suspicious death at Crevecoeur Hall [Lewis Season Three, Episode Two (""Dead of Winter"")]
Inspector Lewis is surprised to learn that his Sergeant, James Hathaway, is the son of Philip Hathaway, and was raised at Crevecoeur Hall with the Mortmaigne children.
2016: Philip Hathaway returns for Season Eight, the final three episodes of Lewis (played by Nicholas Jones)
He is suffering from Alzheimer's and barely remembers his son James.

RED JAGUAR MARK II (photo 8)
1965: Constable Endeavour Morse admires a red Jaguar Mark II (license number 248 RPA) in a dealer's showroom.
1987-2000: Inspector Morse is the proud owner of a red Jaguar Mark II (license number 248 RPA)
The Jaguar Mark II was produced between 1959 and 1967.
In Season Three of Endeavour Constable Morse chauffeurs Inspector Thursday in a black Jaguar Mark I, but I think it belongs to Thursday.

This is the official PBS Blu-Ray/DVD release of Endeavour Season Three,
so you should have no playback difficulties in North America,
and you won't need a region-free DVD/Blu-Ray player (however desirable those are)

The PBS Blu-Rays will be released on August 23, 2016 and I have pre-ordered mine.
Season Three began broadcasting on PBS Masterpiece in June, 2016,
so you might think you don't need the Blu-Rays [despite the improved picture]

One brief word of warning:
British mysteries broadcast on PBS Masterpiece are not the unedited UK version.
Example:
""Sherlock: The Abominable Bride"" aired on PBS Masterpiece on January 1, 2016.*
It was 1 hour, 28 minutes, 22 seconds.
The Blu-Ray/DVD was 1 hour, 32 minutes, 17 seconds.
Those 3 minutes, 55 seconds matter to me
[but I am Obsessive Compulsive]

Endeavour, Season Three on PBS Masterpiece:
-- Episode 1 = 1 hour, 20 minutes, 38 seconds (""Ride"")
-- Episode 2 = 1 hour, 21 minutes, 10 seconds (""Arcadia"")
-- Episode 3 = 1 hour, 21 minutes, 10 seconds (""Prey"")
-- Episode 4 = 1 hour, 21 minutes, 10 seconds (""Coda"")
Timed from the opening to ""Next time on Masterpiece Mystery"" (which is the spot where closing credits begin in the UK original)**

Apparently the uncut UK episodes are available as Amazon Downloads.
Amazon Downloads claim a running time of 1 hour, 29 minutes for each episode.
This is about seven minutes longer per episode than PBS.
Can someone confirm?
Time an episode from to the opening to the start of the closing credits.
(save me $3 and the trouble of figuring out how downloads work)
Once the Blu-Rays arrive, I will time them and post the information here for comparison's sake.
For Amazon links to the DVD and Blu-Ray editions, see the first Comment (dated June 30, 2016) following this review.

OBSERVATIONS ON SEASON THREE
I was a bit uncomfortable with Seasons One and Two.
It was hard to see how the brilliant Inspector Morse would evolve from the pathologically timid Constable Endeavour Morse.
Inspector Morse was awkward in social situations, but supremely confident in his ability to solve crimes.
Inspector Morse went out of his way to show off his knowledge of music and literature.
Constable Morse seemed to be embarrassed by his Oxford education.

is dated November 4, 2015.

There is significant expansion on specific incidents hinted at in the Inspector Morse series proper (for instance Morse's early relationship to Strange, and some of the reasons why Morse remained at the Inspector level, while Strange advanced up the ladder).  While a genuine talent at criminal investigation, Morse does not process the political smarts that enable others to navigate the difficult and often ambiguous waters of strict, hierarchical organizations.",1521590400,,540,5.654320987654321

The writing is excellent, as is the acting, and the photography.  The period sets and cars and costuming are all just spot-on.  And you are actually brought to believe that you ARE watching the genesis of a young Morse...his mannerisms, his inflections, his evolution as a policeman and a man...you can clearly see how THIS young man could become the older, weathered Morse that we all love so dearly.  So if you're questioning whether you should buy this series...do yourself a favor and just click the ""Add to Cart"" button.  You won't regret it.",1514505600,,671,4.700854700854701
7712149,4,B01DGN1HY0,"I am still enjoying this show.  Though, this season was not quite up to the standard set by previous seasons and the original series.  It's in danger of becoming another formulaic ""police procedural"" show.
I enjoyed previous season's episode highlighting Mr. Bright.  Was looking for something similar for wpc Truelove or Strange.  Not there.

Best scene of the season:. Morse's wronged girlfriend tells him to move on.  In one tactful sentence, she speaks eloquently of a woman's dignity- and his own:. ""Treat the next one better.""",1512604800,,532,5.127906976744186

7712163,5,B01DGN1HY0,"As a fan of Morse, I was so hungry for more of him after his series ended.

7712164,5,B01DGN1HY0,"One of the best British crime shows that I've seen. The combination of excellent acting, sharp and tight writing, enclosed plots per episode within the overarching plot lines of the principal characters, a thrilling musical score boasting the best classical and opera music possible, an accurate eye for the historical time period and the gorgeous cinematography create one of the most memorable (detective and otherwise) shows in recent history. Grantchester is very, very good, but this Endeavour series with Morse and Thursday are truly in a league of their own (OK, they have to share with Foyle's War in quality but these Endeavour shows are all available on Blu-ray, which is not the case with Foyle's War).

7712219,3,B01DGN1HY0,"It's hard for me to write this review because I adored series 1 and 2 of Endeavor. The series portrays a young Morse, with all the poignancy one would imagine a young Morse to possess. A scholar, a thinker, a music lover. Morse is happy with a good bottle of scotch and an opera to listen to when he is not solving the latest murder. The first two series were beautifully made, were respectful and yet interesting in unexpected ways, without ignoring the Morse all of us from John Thaw's portrayal. In the third series, our young Morse becomes a sidekick in a ""Gatsby"" retread. Ignores a woman he has grown to love in the previous series, even after he has suggested they they leave England together ""as couples do"" and to make matters worse she is a mere extra in the following episodes, without even much of a mention of why. This series seems intent on recreating a ""swinging sixties"" that Morse as a character would never had taken a part in, that's the whole thing about him, he is a music lover, a thinker, a fish out of water in the police department, yet his mind is singular. In series 3 of Morse, it's as if we as viewers are to forget who we have gotten to know and replaced him with someone who looks like Endeavor, but is fairly banal. Too bad, hope series 4 is better.",1487980800,,1282,4.345833333333333

7712390,3,B01DGN1HY0,"I am a great fan of anything ""Morse""; the original Inspector Morse, then Lewis, and now, Endeavour. I think in season 1 & 2 the writers did a great job in introducing us to Morse. He's young, unsure of himself as regards to other people but quite obstinate when he knows he's right - and sometimes even when he's wrong! I think the writers are growing him up slowly and not turning him into the grown up Morse in just a year or two. I watched and watched again season 1 & 2. Originally excited about season 3, I was deeply disappointed!!! What happened? Did the show change writers? They went so far off from the Endeavour of season 1 & 2 I had grown to like. I had a very hard time in watching all of season 3 but kept hoping, rather than believing, they'd finally get the old Endeavour back. It's a bitter pill to swallow after being so satisfied with Inspector Morse, Lewis and the first two seasons of Endeavour. Season 4 - well, let's only hope wisdom sets in!!!",1474070400,2,967,4.2896174863387975

7712397,5,B01DGN1HY0,"We re-watched ""Neverland"", the last episode of Season 2, before starting on Season 3. What happened then is integral to Endeavour Morse's state of mind, and certainly DI Thursday's hardening. It's why Season 3 starts with DC Morse suspended, and living on his own in a little cabin by a lake. ""He doesn't WANT to be found,"" Monica tells Thursday.

But events and his own nature conspire against him, and Morse is pulled back into what he does best, solving murders.

....Episode 1 ""Ride"" Morse's cabin is owned by his friend, Tony's, family. Tony takes him across the lake to the mansion of an upstart millionaire. How are his new friend and the murder of a woman in the woods connected? A bit of melodrama, but I loved the ending.
....Episode 2 ""Arcadia"" Two deaths in the first 10 minutes. What can connect a young woman who collapses on the street after grocery shopping and an artist dying in an apartment fire? And there's a commune, which leaves DI Thursday unimpressed, ""Pot and free love  I suppose. 'Free Love'. In my experience that's the most expensive kind."" This fits in with the setting  Season 3 takes place in Spring 1967.
....Episode 3 ""Prey"" Ingrid Hjort, a 22 year-old au pair, has disappeared on her way home from a night class at Raimer College. DI Thursday has Morse revisit an old unsolved case. Four years ago, to the day, another young blonde was attacked, and she's now in a permanent coma. Thursday's intuition tells him there's a connection.
In this  episode we meet young Philip Hathaway, groundsman at Crevecoeur Hall. If the name sounds familiar, you're right. He will be the father of James Hathaway, Inspector Lewis' right-hand:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Inspector-Lewis-8-Full-UK-Length-Edition/dp/B01DGN6PI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery!: Inspector Lewis 8 (Full UK-Length Edition)</a>
....Episode 4 ""Coda"" A crime boss has died. As DI Thursday says, ""With Harry Rose gone, the jockeying for the top dog could get nasty."" He's right, that very afternoon there's a gangland slaying. The next day, there's a bank robbery and Morse and DI Thursday's daughter are among the hostages.
This has a poignant and very Inspector Morse ending.

Season 3 of ""Endeavour""  originally aired in January 2016.  This is the ""Full UK-Length Edition"" and you get almost 6 hours of atmospheric mysteries. The BluRay and DVD sets have English subtitles available on the episodes as well as the Special Features.
....A. ""Making of Endeavour"" (9 minutes) Commentators include Shaun Evans (plays Morse), Sean Rigby (plays DS Strange), Roger Allam (plays DI Thursday), Anton Lesser (plays CS Bright), Tom Mullens (producer), Charlotte Mitchell (costume designer), Irene Napier (makeup designer), Alex Cost (location manager), Dakota Blue Richards (plays WPC Trewlove) and Anna Pritchard (production designer). Mitchell talks about the character Morse: ""He loves his suit as a barrier. He has it done up. He puts his hands in his pockets. It's his structure, to give him some distance from who he might be talking to.""
....B.  ""Interview with Shaun Evans"" (5 minutes) I think Evans excellently foreshadows the grumpy Morse in the original series. Evans says Morse has ""an oversensitivity, I think, to the darkness ... in human nature, and also not being able to let go."" Not to mention the legendary ""being very susceptible to a damsel in distress.""
....C.  ""Interview with Roger Allam"" (5 minutes) Allam on his character in Season 3: ""There's a sort of death sentence hanging over him.""

Author Colin Dexter, who created Inspector Morse, had cameos in all but 3 of the 33 episodes of the original ""Inspector Morse"" series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Morse-Collection-Complete-Series-36-DVDs-3600-Minutes-3-Bonus-Specials/dp/B00H3UCGEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Morse Collection Complete Series 36 DVDs 3600 Minutes + 3 Bonus Specials</a>
He continues this tradition in the 12 ""Endeavour"" episodes to date, including the Pilot. If you haven't noticed Dexter's fleeting moments, there's a blog called morseandlewisandendeavour.wordpress(dot)com where he's put together a video showing each appearance. The sighting in the last episode, ""Coda"", is admittedly iffy, as it's from behind.

This is an exceptional show, though I admit my appreciation of this prequel series is heightened by my love for John Thaw's original portrayal of Morse.  ""Endeavour Season 4"" is in production, to air in 2017, which will be the 30th anniversary of the first ""Inspector Morse"" series. Series 4 will have several guest cameos by actors in the original series.

7712409,5,B01DGN1HY0,"What a great series this is.  The acting is superb, the scripts are intelligent and keeps you guessing.  It has a human quality to it and holds your interest through the entire episodes.  The pleasure of seeing this and the outcome of the various stories are encompassing for the audience.  You think you know the outcome but they fool you with the intelligence of good officers and their leaders to show how it is done.  Shaun Adams as inspector Morse is excellent and the story of his start as a DC makes you understand how the older Morse became the character he has become.  Alan Allum as Inspector Thursday is a great mentor for the younger Morse who sets him on the right road for his life and career.  A pleasure to watch such fine acting.  And, it is always nice to see Abigail Thaw playing the role of a feisty newspaper reporter.  She is to be proud of as I am sure her father would be to see his daughter appearing in a character he made famous.  John Thaw was excellent as the character of Morse in his older days, but that is another series which everybody should see after seeing this interpretation of Morse as a young man who becomes the good officer he becomes.

7712415,5,B01DGN1HY0,"If youve read my other reviews on Amazon you will know that Im a huge fan of British (or Irish or Scottish) crime and mystery series produced by the BBC or ITV , which air on US TV on either BBC America or PBS.  I really prefer the home video versions because nearly every one of this shows has been edited (for either language or extreme violence  often both  and maybe even brief nudity). I prefer the original. When I reviewed Season 2 of the series, almost a year ago to the day, I deducted one star because of which I called then the non-ending. Cliffhangers are okay sometimes there were way too many loose ends.  As Ill explain in a minute, this Season has no such issues.

Im also a big proponent of not providing episode plot summaries (as some do) because IMHO it spoils the enjoyment. And I most certainly don't like spoilers, so you rarely  if ever  will find one in my reviews. After all, these are called mysteries for a reason.

Since this is the THIRD in the series, I will make the assumption that those reading this review will have seen Seasons 1 and 2 and know the know the main characters - DI Morse and DCI Thursday  and that the crime/mystery series takes place in Oxford, England in the late 1960s (and reflects the political climate then). This season occurs in 1967 with coming of the mod and Carnaby Street fashion trend.  There are four episodes  each lasting from 91 to 93 minutes . Since PBS always includes promo ads at end of their broadcasts, I know that some scenes were edited for US TV (but I cant tell you which). There is no nudity and I don't remember and expletives so it is probably some violent scenes that were cut. The BD version is marked as the full UK version.  The show aired in the UK on the commercial ITV networks, not the BBC.

At the end of the Second Season, DI Morse was sent to prison. As this season starts he is released after 3 months. Its been a year since Season 2 so, frankly, I don't remember why he was sent there. But, it doesnt matter because his time in prison has NO bearing on this season, except that he is back.

As I watched the four episodes I was drawn into the mysteries and was enjoying the acting. The writer does not give the viewer ALL the clues needed to solve the crime until near the end, so you  along with the detectives, are still kept in the dark, so to speak. At least this season the first three episodes focus on a murder (or murders) and, though they tangentially touch on the personal lives of Morse and Thursday, they really are about the murder (and these usually involved RICH people on BIG estates! There are some cast member changes (No, Im not going to tell you who! Why spoil your enjoyment.) I will tell you the tile of the fourth episode  Coda  is aptly named. In this one, ALL the major characters are involved and there really are no cliffhangers. (I think this was the end of the Endeavour series and Im comfortable with that.

The BD of Season 2 had NO  special features  not even a short behind the scene one that most home videos have. This time we get 20-minutes of bonuses. First, there is a 10-minute Making of Season 3 which includes comments from many of the cast. Its well done. There are two 4   minute interviews with the actors who play Morse and Thursday. Each describes their character over the three season. OF COURSE. You should not watch any of these bonuses until after you finish the four episodes. There are spoilers there.

The BD and DVD do have an option for English subtitles and these did prove helpful to me . The accents of some of the characters  and the speed of their voices  on this series made me want to use the subtitles so I could see words that were not familiar to me. Im happy to say that the subtitles are in bright yellow (unlike the white that some shows use) which makes them stand out. But these subtitles move! Yes, move! First it will be in the bottom left of the screen and the next one is in the bottom right and, sometimes, it will be in the bottom middle. Since the show is presented wide-screen, it means that your eyes must move to find the words before they disappear.  Im not sure who at PBS decided to present them this way but I hope they stop.

As I post this review I see a few others posted before this which are long but  more importantly  the reviewer chose to provide so much plot detail that it really, IMHO, spoils the enjoyment for a person who has not already watched the episodes. And, there is a lot of discussion comparing the series with Inspector Morse (of which this is the prequel). I have seen some of the Morse seasons but I took this one on its own.

Though the BD/DVD will not be available in US Region 1 version until August 23rd, I was provided with an advance screener by PBS Home Video in exchange for an objective review.

I do  hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7712416,2,B01DGN1HY0,"I've only watched the first three shows of the four in this set, and am not sure whether I'll watch number four. Having a soft spot for the Morse books, one perseveres I suppose. At any rate, the plot of number one was absurd, number two was a slight improvement, and number three, which I watched last night, was overall very poor. Ludicrous premise, which would have been better suited to Kenya; stilted acting, and not a single character for whom one might generate any empathy or even interest -- cardboard cutouts every one. You know you're in trouble when Anton Lesser portrays the most human character in the show. To make it worse, author Russell Lewis has a tin ear for 1960s language. Who, for goodness sake, ended a sentence, in England in those days, with the phrase ""is all"". Ditto ""finish up"". These, and some others uttered in the show that I can't remember are relatively recent American imports. All the 1960s paraphernalia are present and correct, no doubt, but if you can't get the lingo right, what good are you as a writer?",1470182400,3,1044,4.618279569892473
7712417,4,B01DGN1HY0,"I agree with the assessment made by MIRAREVIEWS here in her review. She states that the plots get more outlandish in this season and the characters have some inconsistent qualities. One of these is that women seem to throw themselves at Morse for absolutely no understandable reason. This also doesn't fit in with the later Morse who only gradually is able to ingratiate himself with a woman. It is never as if a woman is bowled over upon first meeting him.

I have always preferred Thursday to Morse in this series and nothing has changed for me with this season. It could be that Roger Allam is a great actor and that this is nothing surprising (I suspect so as I have seen him in other things). For one, Allam is as good as comedian as he is a dramatic actor. So he has an acting range about him in every episode which no one else does.

We left season two with a cliffhanger on Morse and Thursday and we open by resolving that cliff hanger in episode one here.

One very annoying aspect to seasons one and two was the antagonism Morse seemed to ignite in his chief. This season that has gone. The chief's attitude mollifies in view of Morse's wrongful arrest. It always seemed dubious to me anyway as the guy who is solving all of your cases, for whatever reason, is usually someone you will at least pretend to like.

I don't know if all of the viewers of this show have viewed the originating series of MORSE. I did and I also read all of the novels. That is just the most superb series. I enjoy ENDEAVOUR (Morse's first name) but I have yet to be able to picture him turning into Morse. That seems a flaw which the creators should be addressing sooner rather than later.

Nevertheless, this is well worth viewing.",1468540800,6,1720,4.39622641509434
7712418,4,B01DGN1HY0,"Endeavour Series 3 Was first broadcast on ITV in the UK in January 2016, then on PBS in the US in June/July 2016. It consists of four 90-minute episodes written by Richard Lewis. The year is 1967. The storyline picks up after DC Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans) has been cleared of wrongdoing and released from prison following the scandal of Blenheim Vale boys reformatory. Morse is a changed man, unsure of his future on the police force. The dynamic between characters changes in this series. Chief Superintendent Bright (Anton Lesser) is more amenable to Morses methods and seems to almost apologize for Morses ordeal. Replacing his antagonism is that of newly promoted DS Jim Strange (Sean Rigby), who is now Morses superior. DI Fred Thursdays (Roger Allam) deteriorating health imbues him with a reckless attitude. Young, bright WPC Shirley Trewlove (Dakota Blue Richards) is a new addition. Plots are more far-fetched than previous series, and I have to wonder why so many women are throwing themselves at Morse. Shaun Evans is developing a charisma of his own though. Hes not always overshadowed by Roger Allamjust sometimes.

The episodes are:

Traumatized and disillusioned by the events of the past six months, Morse holes himself up in a ramshackle lakeside cabin in Ride. He sees old friend Tony Donn (Samuel Barnett), whose wealthy cousin Bruce Belborough (Ben Mansfield), an acquaintance from Morses school days, lives with his flirtatious wife Kay (Jemima West) is a palatial home across the lake. Another neighbor is playboy Joss Bixby (David Oakes), who owns the Belvedere nightclub and annoys the neighbors by racing his boat on the lake. On the morning of Good Friday, the body of a young woman, Jeanne Hearne (Meghan Treadway), is found in a nearby wood. DI Thursday is the investigating officer, and he has been unable to coax Morse back to work. But Morse cant resist a mystery, and he turns up a connection between the dead woman and Bixbys righthand man Harry Rose (Vincent Riotta).

Morse is back on the police force when a case of blackmail turns deadly in Arcadia. Richardsons grocery store, owned by Leo Richardson (Richard Dillane) and managed by Ivor Maddox (Chris Larkin), has received notes threatening to contaminate its products if a sum of 50,000 is not paid. Richardson chooses to ignore the threats until a woman dies from eating poisoned food, and a child nearly ingests glass-laden baby food. Protesters alleging that Richardsons grocery is using embargoed sugar from Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) hold a sit-in, but, beyond that, the police have no suspects until a local painter of the avant-garde is killed when his apartment explodes, apparently due to carelessness around solvents. Meanwhile, Mr. Richardson, his attention-hungry wife Annette (Genevieve OReilly) and sullen daughter Verity (Gala Gordon) add to the drama.

In Prey, Danish au pair Ingrid Hjort (Eleanor Williams) disappears after she leaves a pub to fetch the handbag she left at school. The case reminds DI Thursday of the disappearance of a young women who resembled Ingrid in the same area 4 years ago to the day. Ingrid was employed by Spanish research biologist Dr. Hector Lorenz (Milo Twomey), who was working on chemical communication between animals, a project funded by the wealthy Mortmaigne family, whose nearby woods are the site of more disappearances and fatal maulings by what looks like a large feline. A college professor camping in the woods has also gone missing, and a young man last seen lounging on the riverbank is identifiable only by his dismembered arm. The relationships between the Montaigne family, the research, and the cold case make it unclear how many cases investigators are dealing with.

Coda wraps up the series as DI Thursdays physical condition deteriorates and Morse takes the Police Promotion Examination. Harry Rose, from episode 1, has died and left a vacuum in the criminal underground. Thursday expects the Matthews brothers, or one of them, will ascend to Roses position. Cedrick Clissold of Clissold Fashions is shot to death in his car after collecting his companys payroll. Morse runs into an old professor Felix Lorimer (Mark Heap) at a concert, and Lorimer expresses concern for his estranged wife Nina (Samantha Colley), who has taken up with flashy bingo host Paul Marlock (Robbie Carpenter). Nina, meanwhile, tells another story about her husband and Clissold. DI Thursday expects the Matthews brothers to pull something big, and they do, with Morse and Joan Thursday caught in the middle.",1468368000,8,4541,5.11455525606469
