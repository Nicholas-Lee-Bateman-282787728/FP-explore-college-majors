3772778,5,B001R0KHDW,"Simply put, this is a great live recording of some of the best and most original music on the market. No contemporary artist can quite match Coheed & Cambria's flawless technical skill, talented vocals, or unique treatment of their subject matter, and this DVD is a great addition to anyone's Coheed and Cambria library.

While some of Claudio Sanchez's vocals get a little rough or are sung differently than in-studio (the second night, In Keeping Secrets, is noticeably rough), the ""in the crowd"" feel that the DVD provides more than makes up for the shortcomings of live performance. It is also important to remember that very few bands have the fortitude, patience, and skill to remember how to play every song they've ever written, much less all at the same time and then do live performances 4 nights in a row.

With all this in mind, I cannot help but give Neverender five stars. Either you like Coheed and Cambria or you don't really get the appeal, and if you're in the first group, this is definitely for you. Just remember: it's not a studio album, mistakes are to be expected!",1276732800,,1088,4.69109947643979

Great look at why they have some of the most dedicated fans in music. All Coheed fans must see this to appreciate what they are missing at the live shows.",1274918400,,296,4.120689655172414

3772784,5,B001R0KHDW,"I happened to see the video for ""Welcome Home"" on Fuse from the New York show and I ordered that night.  Coheed is a great band and this is a great, high quality box set.  The extra documentary is so good my family watched the whole thing about two minutes after I opened it.  I couldn't imagine any music fan not enjoying this.",1238457600,,328,4.174603174603175
3772785,5,B001R0KHDW,"Let me start off by mentioning that this is my first taste of Coheed and Cambria. I've heard a lot of buzz about the band and these ""Neverender"" shows. This dvd confirms all accounts that this band just flat out rocks!!! The camera work is the best I have seen, and I have been collecting concerts on vhs and dvd for about 20 years. The musicians in this band are captured performing four conceptual albums in their entirety. These four guys play this incredible music technically brilliant and with emotion and confidence. The crowd knows every word and they both feed off each other to create a musical performance that never gets stale.
Even though there is a central theme going on in each of these four performances, each album seems different in its context and ""angst"". When finishing the first dvd I have to say that ""In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth"" just blew me away. The performance was top-notch and the music was unbelievable. On the second disc it just keeps getting better. They add another percussionist for the 3'rd album, as well as 2 female background vocalists. The last song on the album finishes with guitar mania between Sanchez and Stever that is jaw-dropping. What a finish!!! On the last performance they are back to the 4-piece(There is a pretty decent keyboard player throughout each performance as well) with the 2 background vocalists. This performance is another display of just how musically tight and confident these guys are. Another brilliant performance to compliment another great piece of work.
And as if this dvd set could not get any better, my man WARREN HAYNES comes out to do 2 songs on the encore. If Haynes will step out with these guys than that seals the deal for me. Coheed and Cambria are not a fading light in the rock world, but a burning star that shed its light through my eyes and ears through this amazing, amazing performance.

All in all, I can't say enough about this dvd set. If you are a fan of rock music, this is definitely for you. The 2 guitar players are about the best I have seen in a long , long time. The bass player plays the strings off of his Fender bass. The drummer is a machine who never stops and never seems winded. IN MY COLLECTION OF CONCERTS, THIS ONE HAS RISEN TO THE TOP OF THE PILE. IT IS JUST AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE IN BOTH VISUAL AND SOUND!!",1238371200,34,2332,4.552380952380952
3772786,5,B001R0KHDW,I picked up this two-DVD set and have been really enjoying it.  It's perfect for a new fan of C&C because it includes live versions of just about their entire body of work for a very cheap price.  The video quality is fantastic and the performances are great.  Highly recommended!,1238112000,7,280,4.56
3772787,5,B001R0KHDW,High quality video with good editing. Displays song names during performances. Excellent show.,1412812800,,94,6.3076923076923075

3772789,5,B001R0KHDW,Excellent quality and sound. The relationship betweeen the band and the fans is incredible to watch. Why don't you have this ?,1391990400,,126,4.7727272727272725
3772790,4,B001R0KHDW,"Amazing show. All the guys played the tunes with their hearts. Only problem is the sound mixing is terrible. You can hardly hear Claudio's guitar, the main issue. It takes away a lot of angst and edge from the overall sound. For example on ""Devil in Jersey City,"" the pre-chorus arpeggiated Claudio lick is completely missing, even though you witness him play it. There are more and more examples (like every solo he takes) but it'd be a waste to post them all. It's just disappointing. I wish Coheed had an opinion of the sound mixing.",1391558400,,536,4.59375
3772791,5,B001R0KHDW,I typically hate live recordings of music or concerts. To be honest I can't think of a single one I've ever liked. The lone exception is this DVD. The audio is mixed very well and doesn't sound like crap (which usually happens in these kinds of recordings). The energy you feel from watching the sets is intense and the whole thing is very moving. I loved it.,1388707200,,359,4.373134328358209
3772792,3,B001R0KHDW,"made a great gift, very nice. the individual was very pleased with the item and use it right away. thank you!",1388620800,,109,4.238095238095238
3772793,5,B001R0KHDW,"was so excited to receive this DVD because Coheed & Cambria are a great band and I was anticipating something mind blowing....I was not disappointed! This DVD was just AWESOME!! The 4 different concerts were CRAZY!! All of the music was just off the wall fantastic!! I loved the energy of the crowd, and the energy of the band, all the guys looked like they were having a good time. I loved watching Claudio Sanchez change shirts, and change hairstyles. All of my favorite songs were performed, I couldn't have asked for more with this DVD!! I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves exciting original, innovating pure talented music!!",1387152000,2,634,4.7727272727272725
3772794,5,B001R0KHDW,Coheed is amazing. I have watched this over 20 times in 6 months. They need to do another with for the last 3 albums,1384992000,,116,3.875
3772795,5,B001R0KHDW,"This is a fantastic DVD set,  I caught the first night of the show by dumb luck and I loved it but I was dying to hear the other albums from the second and third nights.  These recordings absolutely don't disappoint.  I've watched them on my very high end tube driven stereo (as in two channel) system on a blu-Ray player that upscaled them to 1080p/24fps and the video quality is quite nice.  The audio is clearly recorded directly from the soundboard -  the quality is excellent and the soundstage the recordings produce is spot on.  If you're a Coheed and Cambria fan you owe it to yourself to get this set.",1381276800,,610,4.401785714285714
3772796,5,B001R0KHDW,"Amazing I was blown away by how they played all they're albums live and the crowed responded wonderful, in my opinion one of the best bands ever",1363824000,,144,4.37037037037037
3772797,5,B001R0KHDW,"If you like Coheed and Cambria, then how could you NOT like this collection?  It's their first four albums played in order, live on stage.  The recording quality is great, the stage presentation is awe inspiring, and the crowd is positively thronging with energy!  I only wish I had been there myself.",1357948800,,301,4.75
3772798,5,B001R0KHDW,If you're a Coheed fan this two disc live concert dvd is pretty perfect. It is almost as good as actually seeing them live.,1349654400,,123,4.166666666666667
3772799,5,B001R0KHDW,"This was the first DVD of Coheed and Cambria that I have purchased. I have seen them in concert twice and will see them again this month. Blown away by the audio and visual experience captured by this particular DVD. Check out the ""The Final Cut""",1349049600,,246,4.369565217391305
3772800,5,B001R0KHDW,"Neverender was a short series of four-night concerts that occurred in 2008 by the band Coheed and Cambria.  To date the band had only put out four albums in the Amory Wars series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Second-Stage-Turbine-Blade/dp/B006X9GRX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Second Stage Turbine Blade</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Keeping-Secrets-of-Silent-Earth-3/dp/B0002E5OJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Apollo-I-m-Burning-Star-IV-Volume-One-From-Fear-Through-The-Eyes-of-Madness/dp/B000AA302A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-World-For-Tomorrow/dp/B000VI70W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No World For Tomorrow</a>.  On each night of the concert the band played through a different album from start to finish.  The Neverender series is named after one of the tracks off of The Second Stage Turbine Blade.

The Neverender concert series occurred in New York, Chicago, L.A., and London.  The film for this set comes from the New York tour dates.  I wish I could have been there, but having been to several other C&C shows I can tell you that it accurately captures their great sound and stage presence.

This DVD set is a must-have for all fans of the band, and would make a great gift.  The 2 DVD set come in a beautiful cardboard fold-out case that is emblazoned with the dragonfly and keywork logos of the band.  Just as the CDs are endlessly listenable for fans of the band, the Neverender concert series is worth enjoying again and again.",1347062400,,1827,7.15695067264574
3772801,5,B001R0KHDW,"Before performing an entire album in concert was the thing to do, Coheed & Cambria already had everyone beat. In October of 2008, the band took to the stage of New York's Terminal 5 to perform not one, not two, not three, but all FOUR of their albums (at the time) back to back. Thankfully the band had the foresight to have it all filmed in high definition and the result, the appropriately titled ""Neverender,"" is a keepsake that no Coheed & Cambria fan -- from the hardcore to the fair-weather -- should be without.

There have been a number of live DVDs from the band, but none capture Coheed & Cambria as well as this set does. Frontman/guitarist/mastermind Claudio Sanchez and co-conspirator/guitarist Travis Stever -- along with the recently departed Chris Pennie and Mic Todd -- bring their A-game to the four concert marathon, putting in as much enthusiasm into their performances as possible while still doing the album tracks justice. As claimed by the liner notes within, there are no overdubs or studio trickery at hand; what you see is what you get. Truth be told, the band stumbles here and there (Claudio in particular lets two female back-up singers carry him a bit on the final night) but for 99% of the concert, the band are absolutely on-fire.

Naturally, the big treat of this set is that every song has its day in the sun. From the well-played radio-hits to the more obscure stuff from the band's first two criminally overlooked efforts, the band spares no expense, even going so far as to indulge the audience in an encore. Little treats such as covers of Iron Maiden and Bob Dylan find the band giving their all and then some. Visually, the stage set-up is pretty simple, with three monitors positioned behind the band which display appropriate imagery for each corresponding song (the final night is accompanied by a screening of George A. Romero's zombie classic ""Night of the Living Dead"") with the focus being on the four band members and the various musicians they employ to help them flesh out the larger than life sound of the albums. This is all captured, of course, by the best quality picture DVD has to offer (a Blu-Ray would be mind-blowing). It's truly amazing they were able to cram this much onto two discs without sacrificing quality; there are, afterall, over five hours of material on hand here.

While the set lacks any special features (there's a more expansive set to found out there) it doesn't need any. The performance speaks for itself and speaks volumes of the band's raw talent and diversity. As one of the few rock bands of their generation to fuse arena rock grandiose with a dense conceptual narrative and somehow make it easy to swallow, Coheed & Cambria are truly in a league of their own. If you are already aware of this fact, then your collection simply is not complete without ""Neverender."" There's a reason that this is one of the few items on this site with five-star reviews across the board so far.",1329782400,,2962,4.6923076923076925
3772802,5,B001R0KHDW,"Love these guys, love this concert series.  My brother and I watched it from start to finish in one sitting.  Freaky coincidence:  During the song 21:13, as Claudio sang, ""When the clock reads 2113"", I looked at my brother's clock and it said 09:13 pm (aka 21:13).  No lie.

Anyway, the audio on these DVDs is great, especially for a live performance.  This is a must have for all Co & Cam fans.  Get it!",1322524800,,404,4.306666666666667
3772803,5,B001R0KHDW,"My first experience with Coheed and Cambria came more or less by accident when my wife and I were given her brother's old computer.  It had the second CD (In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3)in an mp3 folder.  Opening that folder was one of the single most eye-opening musical experiences in my life thus far.

I was instantly hooked on grasping the story behind the incredibly talented music.  I recently came across this DVD set and knew immediately that I had to get it. And it did NOT disappoint!  I agree with each reviewer that said this set of 4 nights, spent playing through the entire set list of their CD's actually makes you feel like you're part of the crowd.  There was a good mix of playing, jamming, brief talking and LOTS of close-ups.  Each night could have stood as its own individual performance, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice not to watch them all; as they each add different elements and sounds (i.e. different instruments, back up vocalists, background imagery, solos, and a guest appearance by Warren Haynes).  I caught myself constantly jamming out in the living room (with my wife telling me [lovingly] to turn it down, and that I looked like an idiot...think Paul Rudd in ""I Love You, Man"") Anyway, as I was not familiar with the SSTB or either of the GAIBS-IV albums, this provided a good opportunity to hear the other songs and see the crowd's reaction.  Now I can say I proudly own all of them (including Year of the Black Rainbow).

This took me about a week to watch.  I have a full time job, a wife and a 2 year old son.  Eventually, I would like to sit down (or rock out, depending) and watch the whole thing beginning to end in its entirety.  However, this was definitely worth a week long viewing....over and over and over again.  The packaging is cool too.  My only gripe is that I feel like I am going to have to end up going and getting a jewel case for it, because the package is just a fold over slipcase with slots for the two DVDs.  I've already managed to put one scratch on a disc :(, but thank God it didn't disrupt anything.  This DVD set is also the first recorded concert of drummer Chris Pennie, and sadly, the last for Mic Todd (bass).  He will be missed.

If you are a fan of music in general, this would be a collection worth having, at least for diversity's sake.  It's energetic, evenly spaced out (each night is almost an hour and a half, more or less), and diverse in its delivery.  Thank you to my wife's brother for leaving this music on the computer, and THANK YOU Coheed and Cambria for providing such awesome entertainment.  Needless to say, future concert releases will be on my watch list.

**For other references to this band and the meaning behind the music, I recommend seeking out the graphic novels ""The Amory Wars,"" written by front man, Claudio Sanchez.

--New Sidenote...Chris Pennie has now left the band (11/3/2011) and Josh Eppard has stepped back in.",1317168000,7,2938,4.5
3772804,5,B001R0KHDW,"Coheed And Cambria's Neverender DVD was filmed in New York back in 2008 and released in 2009 and contains all of the band's first four albums played live, in their entirety from beginning to end.

The first thing that needs pointing out is that as an actual DVD, this is incredible. I own over one hundred live concert DVDs from a variety of different genres and time periods and even now a few years on from its release, I still think that Neverender has some of the best visuals, camera work and editing any band ever had on a live DVD.

This is added to the band's great stage design, with screens and backdrops, excellent lighting and just a general visible air of effort all around.

For the most part (and especially on Second Stage Turbine Blade concert) the performance of the band is utterly incredible, improving on the studio version with added power and confidence. Claudio's vocals are much better than on their The Last Supper DVD and drummer Chris Pennie does a great job all around, really giving the songs depth and attitude, and he even gets an excellent drum solo at one point.

For the two later albums, the band get out guest female vocalists to cover for the amount of intertwining simultaneous overlaid vocals that appear on the studio albums, which is largely fine although they obviously don't sound exactly like how Claudio sang them on the album. All throughout there is an additional keyboard player on stage to replicate the string sections and other extras in the songs.

The DVD and the performances therein are exceptional. There are very few critisms to be made at all. The final album, No World For Tomorrow loose a little something live, in that the studio counterpart was much heavier than the band play it here and Claudio sometimes struggles with some of the more complex vocal parts. The album also gains something however, as it was the band's most overproduced studio album and tracks like `Mother Superior,' and `On The Brink,' sound incredible in their stripped down live forms, which I feel balances it out.

If you like Coheed And Cambria you'd be mad not to buy Neverender, the quality is astounding and there is a hell of a lot of it to enjoy.",1311465600,2,2190,4.660621761658031

This dvd is for Fans and new comers, I honestly can't think of a better way to be introduced to the music than to watch this dvd.
