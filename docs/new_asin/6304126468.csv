7863372,5,6304126468,I only wish there were more dvds of gardens to purchase.  I have several I watch when I just need to sit back and relax.  It would be nice to have some gardens to view of other countries along with the US.,1396396800,,205,3.857142857142857
7863373,4,6304126468,"A tour of some of England's most beautiful cottage gardens, together with short interviews with the gardeners who made them. This is the best kind of garden for most of us to view, because they are more attainable, unlike some of the large country house gardens and public gardens maintained by numerous full-time gardeners. The segments have many ideas that are useable by American gardeners and that may inspire you in your own yard. These are lovely gardens that you will wish to view over and over again.",1363910400,,508,4.784090909090909
7863374,3,6304126468,"The film itself is wonderful with plenty of thatched roof cottages and small English villages.  HOWEVER, the disc won't play in my normal dvd player, though it will play in my portable player!  The disc is visibly thicker and heavier than a normal disc.  If you decide to go ahead and buy this make sure you test it as soon as you receive it!",1276473600,,342,4.3125
7863375,1,6304126468,The first DVD I received had no audio. I returned it and you sent another. The second had no audio. And I returned it. I assume you credited my account. I have never received another. Sorry. I would like to have the product with audio!,1219881600,,235,4.2444444444444445
7863376,5,6304126468,"You will adore this!  This dvd explores 8 charming, beautiful gardens, with glimpses of the cottages they surround.  If you've had a bad day, or are stressed, this is a 45 minute ""getaway"" from real life.",1183075200,,204,4.638888888888889
7863377,2,6304126468,"I was very disappointed in this video. I got the impression the filmmakers took their home video camera to England, and during a free tour, perhaps, happened to video a few very nice English gardens and briefly interview the  owners. The gardening information was very superficial, with less than  minimal practical information to apply. No doubt, the gardens are  beautiful, but you don't learn anything substantial about them. Also, the  narration amounts to a lot of hyperbole with a smidgeon of tourbook data to  barely keep it afloat. Basically, the  narration amounts to filler. Too  bad, because the gardens themselves leave you wanting to know so much  more.
This is a video that gives the impression, whether true or not,  that it was made in return for a free trip to England, on a low budget, and  without much hard work having gone into it.",964137600,,852,4.813793103448276
