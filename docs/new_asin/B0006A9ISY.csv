8040926,1,B0006A9ISY,"In the summer of 1987 I had the misfortune of staying at Ted Mikels house for a few days. My now deceased step-father, who was a nice guy but also a complete fool, had moved to Las Vegas and was living with Mikels, hoping to use this association to get into the film business. My step-father was just one of several hangers-on that Mikels surrounded himself with, apparently as a means to serve his absurdly inflated ego. I stopped over for a few days while on my way to California and it was perhaps the weirdest experience of a life. Mikel's home was like a bizarre ""mini-castle"", decorated with an armored knight statue and a skeleton sitting on a throne. Mikels walked around in gold sequin underwear barking orders at everyone in sight. I told my step-father he was an idiot for associating with this guy and left the house as soon as possible.

This product really offers nothing in terms of film making. Instead it's just a ""vanity project"" for Mikels to ramble on about his bottom of barrel exploitation films from the 60's and 70's. He chats with two hangers-on and then shows trailers for his various trashy flicks such as ""Astro Zombies"" and ""Corpse Grinders"". This is a complete waste of time and money, just another attempt to exploit the public by this low life, sorry excuse for a human being.",1223856000,,1308,4.589743589743589

I am a huge idiot for having bought this without checking the reviews first. You would be a much bigger idiot if you repeat my mistake. Take your money you would have spent on this and flush it down the toilet, while doing so film it on your cell phone camera, burn it to a DVD, and your finished product will be more interesting and worthwhile than this tripe. What a colossal waste. No redeeming value of any kind, except to say that clearly ANYONE can ""make a movie"".",1191369600,2,474,4.266666666666667
8040928,1,B0006A9ISY,"This is 101 minutes of poorly shot talking heads, discussing seventies schlock movies with very little redeeming value.  That would have been tolerable if there was any insightful directing instruction.  Simply not there.  I was disappointed, myself.

8040929,1,B0006A9ISY,"I don't like to really be negative in general in my life, but I feel I must truly warn those out there who think this is a slick well-polished instructional video, to take a second look at all these comments. This video looks like and was probably shot in the early 80's with home video cameras. It is not interesting nor is it very good at teaching, and the films it shows you how to aspire to are really cheap B-movies that wouldn't sell in the $1 DVD bin at Walmart. Time to retire this old video and take it off the search engines. Steer clear filmmakers...",1175558400,3,561,4.252336448598131
8040930,1,B0006A9ISY,"Directing Movies, Vol. 1: From Action to Wrap by Ted V. Mikels sounds like a complete A-Z explanation of movie making, right?  Don't be fooled like I was.  It's nothing more than an unprofessional interview with Mikels who shows off numerous movie trailers from some of the worst films you've ever imagined.  As bad as the movies are, they do offer hope.  If Mikels could get funding for dogs like that, it should be easy for the rest of us.",1152403200,4,441,4.475
8040931,1,B0006A9ISY,"This dvd should really have been titled ""My brilliant career"", since it consists entirely of 101 minutes of a self-promotional interview of a director/producer/editor called Ted V Mikels, famous for such gems as ""Corpse Grinders"", ""Astro-Zombies"" and ""Blood Orgy of the She-Devils,"" amongst others (including something called ""Black Klansman"", which we are assured preceded Mississippi Burning by 20 years, though it bears no resemblance to any movie one would pay money for. One of the interviewers looks like she stepped out of ""Blood Orgy"" and the other, who we are informed is a ""writer"", appears bored and embarrassed. For the entire period we are exposed to 3 minute trailers of each of Mr Mikel's 11 movies from the 1950's to 1970's (which cannot even be called B grade) followed by inane questions (such as ""Were those real worms?"" - the movie in question involves endless scenes of persons eating worms - and yes, they were real, we are earnestly informed).  Mr Mikels himself has sufficient vibrancy to sustain his self-aggrandizement for the full 101 minutes, while taking credit for having been the first to consider heart transplants, claiming that Charlie's Angels was plagiarised from his earlier ""Doll Squad"", and attempting to obtain funding from viewers for his upcoming ""Corpse Grinder 2"" God help us.  The man also has a webpage: [...], which I undertake never to visit.
This is not an instructional dvd and one is left feeling cheated out of money and time. Keep away.",1141084800,23,1489,5.048780487804878
8040932,1,B0006A9ISY,"I purchased a download of this product.  It was horrible.  Poor quality.  Of no instructional value whatsover.  One of the worse purchases I've ever made, period.",1127952000,21,162,5.115384615384615
8040933,1,B0006A9ISY,"I was hoping that this DVD would in some way shed light on the topic of directing.  Not a chance.  This is nothing more than an interview with someone I have never heard of talking about movies I've never seen (or would want to) with two hosts that are stuck in the 80's (and not the good part of the 80's, if there was one).  Or was this shot in the 80's?  Imagine John Waters, Roger Corman, and Hugh Heffner all rolled into one, but with out any hint of ability or talent.

Simply put, who cares.  Save your cash and watch a classic movie.",1121731200,34,541,4.104761904761904
