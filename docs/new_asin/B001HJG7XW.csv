8308888,5,B001HJG7XW,"I have the Region 1 (US) release of this DVD.  The video and sound quality are both pretty good for a camcorder recording in the audience.  But the best part about it is having a live video of these guys from back in the day of their classic first two albums.  The only time I saw them live during that time was before I knew their music and came to love it.  So this video is basically a missing part of my life that I never got to experience 20 years ago!

Included on this DVD is the documentary ""Inside The Metal"" which was originally released as a bonus on one of their Metal Blade releases (which I believe had to be played in a computer).  It documents the band's first go 'round, followed by their break up and subsequent reunion through the time of The Downside album.

This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of 80's speed metal.  If you're in the US, try finding the Region 1 version unless you have an all region DVD player.  Otherwise you'll need to get some software which will allow you to make a region free copy that you can play in the States.",1299715200,,1053,4.147783251231527
8308889,4,B001HJG7XW,"Don't buy this if you're expecting modern crystal clear HD DVD quality. But if you want to see what it REALLY felt like in the 80s and you were a fan of HADES pick this up, our ONLY official DVD release. The show is fun to watch, but for me, the coolest part is all the old footage AFTER the show. It features interviews with myself, Alan Tecchio, Jimmy Schulman, Ed and Scott around the time we recorded The Downside for Metal Blade plus tons of OLD footage and clips from other live shows. So after you watch the Boston show theirs another hours worth of old footage, MTV mentions etc.",1238112000,3,587,4.297297297297297
