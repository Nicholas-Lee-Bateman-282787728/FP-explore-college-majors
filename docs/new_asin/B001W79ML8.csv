8347074,5,B001W79ML8,"If you are a fan of the TV series ""Monk"" you will enjoy these DVD's.  I was disappointed when Sharona left the series because she was a great character.  However, I think they made up for this change by giving the Captain a bigger and more humerous role.  If you like to laugh, you'll love this series.",1291420800,,302,4.2631578947368425

8347077,5,B001W79ML8,"We never watched Monk while the seasons were running on network TV.  However, I did catch a re-run and got hooked on this very delightful sitcom; it helps that we have a son with some ocd behaviors, but regardless of his ocd affliction - the show is pure delight and the plots are original and entertaining.  Cast of other characters is original also and makes this show quite worthy of all the emmys it has received.",1284768000,,417,4.473684210526316

8347079,5,B001W79ML8,"The TV choices these days are slim if a person puts limits on what is acceptable.  MONK has always been up to now, a program I can watch and know it will be a good program all around.
This is one of the very best programs to watch. MONK is great!!",1240185600,4,247,3.843137254901961
