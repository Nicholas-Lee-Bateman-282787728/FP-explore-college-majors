5085654,1,B007GNJ22G,"Asking people to pay to watch or own this movie should be a crime. I honestly think that it must be some kind of joke. Fortunately, I stumbled across it with my 10$ NetFlix subscription and it was so bad I couldn't tolerate the first 10 minutes. If the goal was to make a gay porn movie without any porn, horrible actors and disturbingly bad elevator music.........then,  good job. This film's producers should have paid me to watch it. Wow, horrible.",1377302400,3,451,4.567901234567901
5085655,1,B007GNJ22G,"I was hoping that there would be some male to male action on this DVD.  Kinda sucks how the cover of a DVD can look so amazing and get you into buying it, but when you play it and all you see is guys modeling.  Really makes you shut the movie off sooner.",1368057600,11,254,3.7735849056603774
5085656,2,B007GNJ22G,"Lets not kid ourselves. this director makes semierotic movies with paper thin plots. little acting and hardly any direction. David DeCoteau has a bit in common with Roger Corman. both provide average B movies. with Corman you get Vincent Price, and top heavy girls running around screaming. DeCoteau has well built men running around in tighty whities, or in this case loin cloths. with about as much the same amount of plot and acting.this movie is pretty much an excuse to see well built men in loin cloths run around, pretend to use a sword, wrestel, throw spears, and to strut. that is about it. the entire movie consists of them struting and showing off their stuff. if your into muscle shows then this is for u. like most Bmovies its fun to mock. the weak acting, the silly lines, the fact that some actors are standing in front of a window! not to mention that the sceanery is littered with palm trees and cant possibly be in ancient Greece or Rome. not to mention the actor with the modern style tats. what exactly is the 'story'? Hera wants to kill Hercules, Athena wants to protect him, he and other warriors are sent to an island to train, or something. Hera still plots her vengeance. egos are brused and quarells begin. Hercules gets poisoned, loses his confidence and must regain it. etc etc etc. oh and did I mention the guys strut? again if you just wanna see a bunch of well built studs run around in loin clothes then by all means watch this movie. don't expect too much though otherwise. its not hardcore, nor is the 'plot' interesting by any means. some of this is repetative, it may even be the same scean looped in some cases. I watched this instant on Netflix which i recomend, in case you don't want to pay for it. any way, if you like wellbuilt men in loin cloths watch this movie, if you want a movie with plot watch something else.",1349481600,11,1858,4.4676470588235295
5085657,1,B007GNJ22G,"I don't really know where to start with my review. The movie, I'm assuming, is a thinly-veiled excuse to have well-built men prance around in loincloths. And while that is all well and good. Half of the movie is just shots of these men posing as if they are statues. Every once in a while they'll change positions. What makes this laughable is that there will be some heavy Carmina Burana-esque music accompanying it, as if what we are seeing is really heady drama.

Setting: Aside from some stock footage, most of the movie occurs in one of these places, a pool, a backyard and a green screen.

Music: As mentioned above, laughably out of place for most of the film. It was as if there was a deliberate attempt made to choose the wrong music for each scene.

Acting: The actor playing Hercules couldn't act wet in a rainstorm. His line delivery is about as blunt and effective as trying to slice a birthday cake with a Mack Truck. To be perfectly fair, none of the other cast members seem to be trying. I'm baffled if these were the best takes they could get.

Story: This is perhaps the most disappointing part. Here we have the promise of a half-way entertaining story. Sure some liberties were taken with the mythology, but that's forgivable, and could simply be a stylistic choice.  However, most scenes with exposition seem to be rushed so they can shoehorn another montage of men posing for another 20 minutes.

Visuals: It doesn't take a genius to recognize this was cobbled together in an afternoon. The men are admittedly handsome and actually fit with the Greek form of male beauty. I feel this is more of a coincidence than anything else though. The special effects are phoned in much like the rest of the performances in this movie.

This movie fails to deliver on every aspect. We as the audience don't get invested in the characters. Flat acting all around. Little to no plot. This movie doesn't even have homoerotic undertones, and in a movie with almost nude hot guys set in Ancient Greece, that's perhaps the most baffling thing.",1341273600,23,2047,4.622589531680441

5085659,1,B007GNJ22G,"This is the worse movie ever.
Acting is miserable, poor, I was used to see better quality at high school presentations that what I got on this DVD.
It is boring, the director repeats scenes unnecessarily, if you take away all the modeling, repeated scenes, sky and old panoramic pictures, then you will get a 20 minute dialog that does not make sense for a movie.
I'm so disappointed, I should have given the cost of the DVD to a homeless to by a lunch, it would have been more productive that just wasting it in this video.
It should not be sold, people should be paid to see it.
If you are considering buying it, I recommend you to stop right there, read all the reviews, and look for a real movie.",1438041600,3,700,4.2706766917293235
5085660,1,B007GNJ22G,"This may actually be DeCoteau's WORST movie in the 1313 series. One star is two too many. First of all, since DeCoteau almost always uses the ""1313 House"" on Malibu Heights and since this is ""Ancient Greece"" all the action takes place just in front of the house with its pool as a backdrop.  The ""house"" is not to be seen. After all, we can't see ""modern"" architecture with half of a Volkswagen in the midst of its living room. (Due to rainfall, part of the movie was filmed indoors but the scenes were set in front of windows and glass doors to make it appear as though everyone was still outside.) Typical DeCoteau stock footage of waves on the Porto Rican shore and thick cloud formations above abound in this movie and seem to be endlessly repeated.  To this, DeCoteau adds stock footage of a ruined Parthenon and some generic ruined Greek columns to give us the locale. That too is repeated again and again.  Hercules & Co. are being trained by a special trainer (not very impressive looking) to prepare them against a possible onslaught from the wrath of the Goddess Hera who is jealous of her husband's (Zeus's) bastard son.  Anachronisms abound and are laughable.  The young men (5, aside from the trainer) are all dressed in loin cloths (no tidy whities here) that look like they were purloined from a bad Western movie after even the ""Indians"" had cast them aside. The hair is all styled in a contemporary fashion, and I won't even begin to go into the dialogue. The Goddess Athena is also present acting in an advisory role. As the second most powerful deity in the Greek pantheon, next to Zeus, this Athena comes across as a preachy pretty girl whose demeanor and headdress make her look and sound like a lost date at a Fraternity costume party. She is constantly referred to as the goddess of wisdom (which she was). However, she was also the goddess of victory and battles, and more powerful than Ares/Mars. The young men constantly flex their muscles and pose like Greek statues, but come off as rejects from a Mr. Universe (or whatever) contest. Their posing is as stilted and repetitive as the dialogue and stock film footage. The entire story which is probably only worth about 10 minutes of viewing time (if that much) has to do with a jealous betrayer in the group who is attempting to do Hera's bidding. With the recent addition of more ""Hercules"" movies to the sword and sandal genre, I guess DeCoteau felt that he should try his hand at it.  The result: Steve Reeves and Gordon Scott must be rolling over in their graves. To watch this film is like performing one of the Labors of Hercules!",1437868800,,2613,4.572649572649572

5085667,1,B007GNJ22G,"Admittedly, I didn't have high expectations when I found this on Netflix streaming. I was lured in by the shirtless beefcake and had some insane thought that they couldn't possibly be worse than those Twilight dorks. I knew it wasn't going to be Spartacus level production quality, but I had no idea that I was in for the diametric opposite of it.

The other reviews cover the horrible acting, ridiculous dialogue, WTF music, and a set that is obviously someone's backyard pool that's desperately in need of some concrete work. I don't think that they stress enough the over 30 minutes of beefcakes in loincloths ""training"" montage/wanna be body builder posing on pedestals. It's pretty obvious that none were truly practiced in weapons or wrestling choreography, so I guess they decided to just keep looping the guy who actually *kind of* looks like he *sorta* knows what he's doing. I'm still wondering WTF was up with the hot tub scene. Their facial expressions said less ""I'm relaxing after a workout,"" and more ""Hercules is giving me a happy ending.""  Yeah, the homo-eroticism is that thick. LOL.

Basically, this is filmed at a porn level, using porn level actors, and I have no idea what you would call the script. At one time I wondered if it was just a bunch of Film School Fratboys doing satire. Within five minutes I realized that, no...no....they really are serious here. The only excuse I can think of for the Director to repeatedly loop the same scenes is he cut out the naked dude on dude oil wrestling.",1400198400,,1518,4.742424242424242
