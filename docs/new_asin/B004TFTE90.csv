4465515,5,B004TFTE90,"As there's not really much more to say about Kathryn's classes than they're lots of fun and suitable for beginners as well as advanced yogis, I'd like to say something that was really important to me. I live in Europe and thought I'd have to watch this DVD via my computer, but no - it seems to be region code free after all (stated region code 1/us and canada in product details). It played first time on my DVD player and I'm soooo happy about that. Hope this information is useful to some other people out there who aren`t sure if they should buy because of this issue.",1316908800,2,572,4.305555555555555
4465516,5,B004TFTE90,"I bought this yoga video because it was a great price, and I am always looking for a great new yoga practice. I was not disappointed. The instruction is very clear, and the lengths of the classes are perfect. The 25 minute practice is perfect for my busy schedule, and is challenging enough, but ok for beginners.  The setting and the music is also very pleasant in this video. Katherine does not move too fast through the poses like some other videos. Overall, one of my favorites ever. This video will help anyone advance their practice and is a great value.",1316736000,3,560,4.544554455445544
4465517,5,B004TFTE90,"I was looking for a Yoga DVD that would get me moving and challenge me in the morning. I love the spirit of Aim True and Kathryn's ability to inspire and instruct the poses. I'm a bit of a chicken when it comes to balance and inversions and her attitude is helping me push past the fear. I'm smiling just thinking about the 25 minutes I spent with her this morning. Very real. Very effective leader, who feels like a supportive friend.",1316563200,4,435,4.317073170731708
4465518,5,B004TFTE90,"I actually joined Yogaglo simply so that I could experience a ""class"" with Kathryn and I have been hooked every since. Kathryn has a style which is distinct and unique. She is not all fluffy/spiritual all the time...in fact she is great for the more aggressive, athletic yogi's. This is not to imply that her flow has no connection to spirit or mind/body as I do find her to be deeply connected and very good at conveying what is necessary. She is not constantly reminding you to connect with breath or spirit or any of that and while there are some days that I want a practice that does place more focus on the mind/body connection I love Kathryn for when I want to sweat and build muscle and strength.

I consider myself to be an avid practitioner of yoga. I have had a steady practice for the last 7 years. I find that even her beginners flow is definitely challenging and gets the heart pumping. Her intermediate flow is definitely a whopper and accomplishes what some fail to do in even a 90 minute class and hers lasts just 45 minutes which is perfect from this work from home mama of two.
I am so glad that I purchased this disc and cannot wait to see how her teaching continues to unfold. This is definitely a must buy for those who are looking to add to their collection of at home sequences, want to tone and build strength or simply want to relish in Kathryns enjoyable, comfortable and affable teaching style. Thanks Kathryn!",1315526400,34,1437,4.443181818181818
4465519,5,B004TFTE90,"I came across Kathryn on Yogaglo where she has online classes and liked her fun and challenging approach to vinyasa and her love for arm balances which I love as well. I tried Authentic Flow which is the intermediate 45 minute practice on this DVD and liked it a lot, it really packs a punch in this short time. It starts with a warm up of some down dog - chaturanga - cobra vinyasas and some sun salutations and then some core work on your back which was very nice and a little challenging and includes boat and half boat pose as well as some others. There's also cool vinyasas with side plank variations and warrior one, warrior 3 to high lunge and revolved lunge and a cool archer sequence where you aim an imaginary arrow in warrior 1, 2 and extended side angle . Other poses include half moon and crow, half standing splits with some kicking as a prep for handstand, pikes, forearm stand prep and 2 rounds of wheel , it ends with happy baby , lying twist, Paschimottanasana, and double pigeon. There's a short to non existent shavasana but you can stay longer on your own of course. The 25 minute beginner includes the more basic standing poses and easier variations of some poses like side plank with the top leg on the floor. There's also an 8 minute yoga pose tutorial that includes good explanations and some tips on shoulder placement, pikes , crow , half moon and tripod headstand. There is also a link to a nice 10 minute core work which is actaully 5 minutes. Overall I really liked it and Kathryn tips during the practice are helpful and her explanations are amusing at times. I hope she'll come up with some more DVD's in the future that includes more fun, challenge and arm balances. (:",1314921600,62,1702,4.440894568690096

4465522,4,B004TFTE90,"Great DVD, here! I really like Budig's style of yoga instruction, and I love both of the practices contained on this DVD. She is a traditionalist, but she knows how to WORK you, which I just love. The only exercise in which I routinely engage is yoga, so I need that hard work! The only complaint I have (and the only reason I docked a star from this review) is the DVD only contains two practices., while most other yoga DVDs I have contain at least three practices. The first seems way too short, and the second seems way too long. I would have loved to see more practices, just with varying times. In spite of that, however, I would recommend this DVD. I believe it's a worthy addition to anyone's collection.",1441324800,,712,4.401515151515151

The music is also in sync with the routine. One of my favorite parts of this DVD is the interview where she explains her career's development and in another segment, she breaks down difficult yoga poses. The Crow Pose is still beyond me, but she makes it seem doable and possible!",1428364800,,458,4.7375
4465531,5,B004TFTE90,This is a GREAT addition to my home practice DVDS. Her voice and energy are very soothing as well as positive and upbeat. I think that all of the practices on the DVD provide a good level of challenge and a different perspective on yoga. It comes through that Kathryn loves yoga and wants to share it with others. She is not intimidating nor egotistic at all. I love this DVD!!!!!,1425686400,,380,4.366197183098592

4465533,5,B004TFTE90,Great flow! The beginner flow was a little too slow paced for me but would be great for someone just starting out (hence the title). The intermediate flow was much better - quicker and more challenging. I also love the bonus tutorials.,1420761600,,235,4.619047619047619

Excellent for all stages of yoga.  Even when I try new workouts or classes, I always come back to this one on a regular basis.  It will always be in my rotation.  Very grounding and moving practice.",1419811200,,355,4.46875
4465536,5,B004TFTE90,She is charming. The workouts are challenging without being too much for a beginner. The tutorials really simplify some of the more challenging poses.

I could not enjoy any pose and I like to trans between the poses slowly and elegantly but this feels more like a gym workout than yoga. I could not breath. Worst yoga flow ever. My body did not like it. My mind and soul were not in peace. Could not enjoy any moment of it and yoga should be about enjoying yourself, your body and be in the moment...this one is none of them.

4465547,2,B004TFTE90,"I thought my classes at the yoga studio were much better and only bought this based on a referral from one of my teachers.  NOt as good or thorough as I think it should be, did not inspire me.",1402185600,,192,3.923076923076923
4465548,2,B004TFTE90,"I needed a new yoga video to do at home.  I can't afford a yoga studio membership, which would be my ideal, so I refresh my video collection from time to time.  I came across Kathryn on Facebook as a mutual friend and was excited to learn that she has a yoga video with Gaiam!  I was really excited to try something new and fresh.  The first session was a little intense for the ""Beginner"" series.  If that was my very first attempt, as a beginner yoga student, I would probably never do yoga again.  I have a large frame, so I couldn't even do half the poses.  I feel like the more seasoned yoga instructors get bored of the basics, so want to sort of show off.  I think Kathryn has a big heart and is doing a service by being a  yoga instructor, but this video disappointed me.  I am giving it 2 stars for the packaging, her presence, and the atmosphere of the set.  To me, this video would be for me to watch and gain inspiration to eat better, to work harder on my own yoga practice....no to actually do the poses.",1399507200,2,1018,4.142857142857143
4465549,4,B004TFTE90,This is a unique yoga practice. I really like Kathryn. The class is high paced vinyasa yoga. It is very thorough in that it covers all parts of the body and all aspects of yoga in one class. You will not be bored with this one. However this is not for beginners because it is so fast and she doesn't talk much about alignment. But if you are familiar with yoga it will be an very refreshing practice for you.,1399248000,,408,4.1125
4465550,4,B004TFTE90,"A big fan of Kristin McGee, I've had a hard time finding other instructors who are competent, enjoyable and not full of pseudo-Eastern philosophical BS. I've tried many different DVDs, many of which I've done once and never looked at again because they were either not challenging, poorly instructed or so full of faux-mysticism that I just had to turn it off. This DVD will playfully swerve towards all of the above, and then completely do a 180 on itself. This is a bullet point review of Aim True from an intermediate yoga practitioner

Pros:
-Multiple different workouts- putting the beginner and authentic flow together is sure to challenge even the advanced intermediate student
-Unique flow- There are the staple sun salutations peppered in, but there were many poses or variations on poses that were fresh and fun
-Arm balances- I've been looking to expand my arm balances beyond Crow Pose and King Pose; KB is an obvious fan of them and thus challenges you to do some difficult foundation work such as Dolphin Pose
-Time- this is great for me- I can do 25, 45, 70 or 75 minutes of yoga
-Swerves dangerously close to faux-mysticism but then basically laughs at herself and brings it back down to earth
-Archer sequence; I am an archer who shoots both compound and long bow so I could mightily appreciate her archer's flow (in her interview she says her favorite goddess is Artemis of the hunt and moon, who also is close to my heart)

Cons:
-If you are without ANY yoga experience, I do not recommend this...even with the pose breakdown section. There are not enough breathing and alignment cues in the sequence. I recommend Sarah Ivanhoe's beginner DVDs and her Crunch Candlelight DVD to get a more gentle exposure to poses, alignment and breathwork...after getting comfortable with that, I recommend Kristin McGee's Power Yoga (not the MTV one though) to go further into the practice
-Feels very rushed at times...I was left in Chaturanga wondering how the heck she'd gotten to Reverse Warrior so quickly.. however, when she slows down and DOES take her time, her cues are very good
-Arm balances....yeah, I'm not hopping straight into a handstand. You do you KB, but I'll just stay here in Downward Dog Split.
-Too much babble at times when she could be giving breathing and alignment cues

Recommend?: Yes, with caution to advanced beginners through advanced intermediates with a solid sense of personal limits looking for a fun, challenging and aerobic vinyasa practice",1398816000,5,2482,4.876777251184834

4465552,5,B004TFTE90,"I have been practicing yoga now for 2 years and was looking to find a video that was aimed at the intermediate level. This was exactly what I was looking for. The beginner portion goes over basics, but still keeps the pace quick and gets the heart rate up. The full 45 minute ""Authentic Flow"" is fantastic! It goes over more challenging postures and really pushes your practice to the next level. I love how encouraging Kathryn is throughout all of it, always encouraging you to not be afraid. Fantastic video for anyone looking to take their home yoga practice to the next level!",1394496000,,580,4.586538461538462

They have different covers and state different things! However, both dvd's are eactly the same just in different order! Exactly the same, same outfits, same yoga positions, just different order! Never have I been so disappointed in my life! How is this even legal?!? Kathy B is a yogi scam artist, and I'm disapointed Amazon supports this. The yoga postions were great but having two of the same videos is ridicuolous!",1392076800,6,550,4.861702127659575
4465555,5,B004TFTE90,"I just adore Kathryn Budig! She is an awesome instructor, and her video is awesome. The workouts are challenging and refreshing. Most yoga videos are really boring to me.

4465556,5,B004TFTE90,"There is a mellow rutine and one that is super fun and even makes you laugh and I adored it. She is a delight and it makes yoga fun, you eventually end up laughing at yourself and that's not such a bad thing after all. So I highly recomend it just if you want a workout because it is but a fun way to approach yoga.

4465557,5,B004TFTE90,"This is a great yoga workout. I really like how it pushes you to build some upper body strength, but still focuses on all areas of the body.",1389398400,,140,4.035714285714286
4465558,5,B004TFTE90,"So far I've only done the ""beginner"" one. It's pretty challenging for a beginner workout. I'm in shape, but just really got into yoga I guess 6 months ago. I have watched the other harder workout, and it looks challenging.

I saw some people didn't like that she goes fast. I kinda liked that. It really got my heart rate going more. I also found this to make the workout more challenging. Moving from pose to pose gracefully but still keeping up. I like that. Might not be for everyone.

Basically I'd highly recommend this workout if:
you've got some yoga experience, and are looking for a challenge. Not sure if it'd start with this one right out of the gate if you've got no experience.",1387411200,,690,4.468253968253968
4465559,5,B004TFTE90,No excuses this is great for different levels.  I recommend beginners/intermediate folks to have at least 2 blocks and a strap to help with certain positions/stretches.  Yes a mat too.,1386460800,,184,5.1

4465561,4,B004TFTE90,"Great yoga sequences. Some knowledge of yoga is helpful prior to getting this dvd, & advanced practice should only be attempted after truly mastering the beginners & hopefully making good use of some in person training.

4465565,3,B004TFTE90,"I've been doing yoga (Ashtanga and Vinyasa Flow primarily) for over a year now and I wanted to get a video to supplement the classes I was going to so I could save money. I asked my Ashtanga instructor if there were any she suggested, and this was the one. She was right, it is true to its description, the instructor is easy to follow and the flow each class was great and yet still challenging enough. I recommend trying it out.",1381795200,,430,4.2560975609756095
4465566,3,B004TFTE90,"I found the workouts to be challenging but manageable.  The faster pace didn't bother me once I had learned the flow.  However, it took a little extra work to catch all of the instructions as I couldn't both hold the poses and see what she was doing.  I had to watch the routines without practicing just to catch all the details - a first for me!

I think the extra effort would be fine if I didn't find her manic, non-stop talking less than relaxing.  Most of her comments, while well intentioned and probably personally meaningful, felt trite when delivered rapid fire.  To be fair, I am a middle school teacher so my days are already full of endless chatter.  If I have 25 minutes to spare, I want it to be quieter and calmer than the rest of my day.

I think if you have chemistry with Budig and enjoy her energetic style than you'll really enjoy this DVD.  However, I am fairly high energy already so am looking for a workout that will leave me grounded, centered and focused.",1378684800,,981,4.375690607734807

4465568,5,B004TFTE90,"I like this DVD a lot.  I do the beginner practice more often than the authentic practice.  I think the beginner practice is more of an advanced beginner practice.  It's a well rounded practice but the focus is on building up to handstands.  I use it to start the day many mornings.
The authentic practice is longer and faster paced.  I had to do the routine a few times before feeling comfortable with it.  All in all a great value.  Two good practices on one DVD.  Highly recommended.",1373155200,,486,4.443181818181818

4465570,5,B004TFTE90,This workout is a great challenge! I thoroughly enjoy practicing yoga to this DVD. I was sore for days afterward because it worked my muscles so well.,1371859200,,150,4.592592592592593
4465571,3,B004TFTE90,"I've read most of the reviews regarding Aim True Yoga, and I can honestly see both sides of the story. On the one hand, yes, Kathryn does give you a pretty good workout. It's challenging enough to bring up a sweat, but not so challenging that an intermediate-level yoga practitioner like me can't do it. I also like the way she encourages you to ""dig deeper"" in certain poses and moves, such as when you have to jump your feet to your hands.

On the other hand, though, she really does speed through this routine. Her instructions are so brief and moves are so quick that I frequently have to look up to see what she's doing, and by the time I figure it out, she's on to the next move. So the guidance is definitely lacking, as some people have already pointed out. Of course, you can learn a routine by playing the video again and again. But I personally think a teacher should guide her/his students more--and I think that teachers that do this are always respected more by their students.

I also sympathize with the people who feel that this is too focused on working out and not so much so on yoga basics. When I do vinyasa yoga, I do like to feel like I've gotten some workout benefit from it. So I'm okay with that part. But I also like the teacher to warm me up well with lots of sun salutations and, by the same token, to use gradual, traditional yoga cool-down techniques to wind things down. You don't really get that sense with Kathryn's workout. It's just go, go, go...done.

So my verdict is that if you're looking for a quick, intense vinyasa routine, then you'll probably like this. But if you're a bit more of a traditionalist in terms of your yoga, you're probably not going to enjoy this video so much. Look instead to programs from Shiva Rea, Janet Stone or Sadie Nardini (who in my opinion blend the two worlds of yoga fundamentals and intense vinyasa workout much better).",1371513600,6,1894,4.421203438395415

I have been doing yoga about 2-3 times a week for the last 2 years so I consider my level closer to intermediate.  What I did like about the dvd is that Kathryn explains the poses (10 min video) so you know how to prepare yourself in the other two videos.  Some of the poses are challenging especially in the authentic flow video, which is good but Kathryn moves way too fast.  She seldomly holds poses long enough and transitions from pose to pose very quickly.  Other videos that I have used will do the first pose in slow motion so you can get familiar with what you are doing and follows with 2-3reps of the same pose at a faster pace.  I would suggest watching all 3 videos once or twice  before actually taking part in the exercises.  Hope this helps.",1363478400,,835,4.273885350318471

There is a variety of levels and challenges that you can put yourself to the test to. And once you really get into it and enjoy what you're doing, it becomes a really fun adventure. As a newbie though, I did find it a little hard to understand at first and found myself staring at the screen more than on my poses because the session moves along quickly. But once you grasp the movement and the progression of the movements, it's an awesome DVD. Also has a 10 minute session on more difficult poses which I find myself pursuing as well, such as: the crow, dolphin pose, and yoga handstand. Awesome DVD, would definitely recommend it!",1359244800,,738,4.2785714285714285

Kathryn Budig is an awesome person to watch do yoga, she is so graceful and makes it look so easy. Her instruction is clear and concise and I enjoy the inspiring mental positivity that she brings up as you go. This one is very fun and brings in new moves (archer sequence and handstand prep exercises). The image on the front of the DVD isn't done in the practice if you are curious.

While it is semi flow sequences, this is more of an aerobic exercise and less of a focus on meditation and breathing. I enjoy this compared to other yoga DVDs where afterwards I don't feel that I worked out. This is a good balance between stretching and strength.

The beginners workout is a great place to start or for a lighter work out if combining it with other exercises. I find it is a good work out on its own. The advanced one is 45 minutes. There are several handstand prep exercises so you need to have a basic amount of core/upper body strength, please be careful if you try these!",1358899200,2,1127,4.2372093023255815
4465593,5,B004TFTE90,"I'm not exactly advanced in yoga, but Kathryn is such a great instructor that you will try things you didn't think you could and it feels liberating. There are three sections on this DVD, a beginner/intermediate 25 minute routine, an advanced 45 min routine and a 10 min tutorial (which is so great I wished it was much longer). Before coming across this DVD, I've admired Tara Stiles, read her books, bought her 4 DVD set, and tried to get into more advanced positions with her instructions but I was scared of injury and it just didn't work. With Kathryn Budig it's different. She makes you believe you can do it because her instruction is so doable. She is also very encouraging and when she says ""you're floating, you did it"", I'm like, ""yes, I am!"". The first time I had both feet off the ground, it felt like I was on a cloud. Love this DVD. I wish she had more DVDs (both her DVDs are the same, the newer one is just a re-release, unfortunatly).",1356739200,,952,4.3841807909604515

If you are an avid and dedicated ""yoga"" practitioner, you will be very disappointed in this ""work"" out.  More importantly, some of the moves are not safe if you have physiological weaknesses in your joints.  Her need for jumping and bouncing is questionable.  I practice both headstand and handstand, without ever hopping or bouncing around.  They are precise and coordinated movements which require strength and accuracy  -- not hopping.  Also her ""arrow"" series is practiced much to quickly, and an invitation to twist your back right out of alignement.  Again, when practiced precisely and carefully, the ""arrow"" series (which other practitioners have on their videos) is a nice movement for flexibility.  When done quickly and inaccurately it is a recipe for joint damage and pain.  If you want a safe yoga workout, stick with the seasoned practitioners, or with the newer yoga instructors who follow the traditional format.  This video should not be classified as yoga.",1356480000,9,1064,5.16374269005848

I have been doing the 20 minute Beginner workout for a little while now and can feel my strength and flexibility improving.  Last weekend I tried the 40 minute intermediate ""Authentic Flow"" workout for the first time and loved it.  Like other reviewers have said, this instructor takes the scariness out of doing a yogic headstand by breaking it down to the most basic parts.  I'm nowhere near ready to attempt a headstand yet, but little by little I am getting there.  The longer I've been doing this workout the more my confidence builds. There is even a section on the DVD that demystifies some of the more challenging looking poses, and after watching that I can start to understand better what I am doing in the Beginners workout.  I see where this journey will be taking me and I like what I see!

Kathryn Budig seems more like a real person to me, not preaching about the earth and how twisting your body is going to make it a better place, or whatever else a lot of yoga instructors go into. Its really about you, your body, and stretching into the positions. During the practice she stays light and cute, not too serious. She knows what she is doing, you can tell! The workout itself is AWESOME!! The first time I just did the beginners practice and my upper back and shoulders were sore for two days! After I got used to beginners practice I went to the full workout, which is by far the best yoga practice I have ever done. I cant wait until she makes another DVD, I love her!

When I wanted to get started again I picked up some new DVDs, this being one of them. It's fast paced, which can be nice for energizing practices. However, there are a lot of things that she does that require far more physical strength than I have! If anything on this DVD is a problem, that is it.
I liked the section on demystifying certain poses. That was cool, but I can't do any of those either.
For now, I'll just run through the first ten minutes when I feel like it, but I'll have to save the rest for when I've gained enough strength and stability to actually do it.",1342656000,,690,4.2748091603053435

Thanks Kathryn!",1341532800,,329,4.32258064516129
4465600,5,B004TFTE90,"I love this.  Everything about this is positive.  The instructor is cute and positive (without being a granola-cheerleader-aerobics type).  She has good form, explains things well, and the entire experience is both energizing, a little tiring, and calming in one package.  The music is unnoticeable, which for me is huge.  It is fun yoga.  I often get too serious with yoga, and this one is helping me to remember that yoga practice should be fun and that fun does not mean frivolous.
To help you make a judgment what my opinion means, let me tell you other yoga dvds I've got and what I think of them:
*Rodney Yee - Power Yoga : Okay, a decent yoga work out with a lot of sun salutation
*Ana Brett/ Ravi Singh - almost all of theirs, though the last few are (in my opinion) abominable (I'm ducking here for all of the stuff their followers are throwing my way).  I love their middle stuff, which is very similar to their early stuff with MUCH better production values.  The later stuff is like MTV yoga with too much music, too many camera shifts, even her hair style shifts during these sequences, and the background is distracting with the fake water. Something happened when she went blond.
*Gurmurkh - Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh:  I like this.  It is basic, no frills, tiring, fulfilling.
*Ashtanga Collection with Richard Freeman:  A lot of this I cannot do.  I can do the first dvd no problem, the second with some challenges, the third I haven't even attempted yet.  I like his peaceful manner, though it took a bit to get used to it because he almost seems zoned out/in at first.  Very thorough explanations help deepen understanding of why and what you're doing.
*Short Forms Practice Ashtanga - David Swenson:  I like this, though I am not crazy about the instructor.  I think it is because he reminds me of someone, and though that ideally would not influence my opinion, it seems to.
*The Art of Flow Yoga Zuzana Kolinkova - I am not crazy about the way the dvd is set up, the the yoga is very enjoyable, flowing, smooth, and leaves you with a sense of wholeness.
*Barkan Method of Hot Yoga :  I really like this.  This is essentially Bikram with modifications for some of the Bikram poses that tend to back injury.  I am not sure if the sequence is exact or not.",1341014400,5,2277,4.509756097560976
4465601,5,B004TFTE90,I am very pleased with this dvd. I love the beginner yoga practice! it is fast paced and challenging but meditative at the same time.  Great for someone who has done yoga before and wants to get back into it. I am looking forward to working my way up to the intermediate practice.,1339891200,,280,4.283018867924528
4465602,4,B004TFTE90,"This DVD is instructed by Kathryn Budig, a frequent model for the magazine YOGA JOURNAL.  Budig explains in the included interview that she was inspired by the Greek Goddess Artemis to come up with the ""Aim True"" theme, and she weaves this theme into both practices.  Budig offers two main yoga routine, a shorter ""Beginner's Flow"" and then a longer ""Authentic Flow"" which she designates as an intermediate practice.  She also provides a brief tutorial called ""Yoga Poses Demystified,"" which breaks down several more advanced postures.  The final items on the Main Menu are the Exclusive Interview with Kathryn (6.5 minutes) and the link for downloads from Gaiam.

For each of the two yoga practices as well as the tutorial, Budig is alone in a large studio, instructing via voiceover.  Her only prop for the main routines is a mat, but she does use a yoga block to assist with the postures in the tutorial segment.  I have described each of the practices in detail below.

BEGINNER'S (25 minutes)
Budig begins this routine in child's pose.  She moves quickly through a few cat's breaths to down dog, providing the option of movement.  From there she moves on to a chaturanga variation, flowing through a vinyasa which includes plank, baby cobra, full cobra, and returning to down dog.  Eventually, she moves into forward bend and then comes to standing for two rounds of sun salutations.  Returning to the floor, Budig moves through some abs work, including boat pose with bent knees, and then flips over for some work on the elbows.  From down dog, she practices hops, hovering in the air.  She then moves through several standing pose flows, including three-legged dog to low lunge; chair to warrior 1; chair to warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle pose; and triangle to half fish to dolphin/plank poses.  The finishing poses include bridge, happy baby, and reclining twist.  Budig sets up for savaasana, but no time is allowed for the final rest.  This definitely was NOT a beginner's practice, as Budig offers almost no form and alignment tips, and she moves quite quickly throughout the routine; I would suggest that it is appropriate for those at a low intermediate level and above.

AUTHENTIC FLOW (45 minutes)
Budig starts this practice in down dog, again allowing for movement in the posture.  After moving through a few vinyasas from chaturanga to plank and back to down dog, she eventually comes to the top of the mat and performs a total of three sun salutations.  This is again followed by abs work:  although she continues to keep the knees bent for boat pose, she also adds several rounds of boat to half-boat.  Returning to down dog, Budig practices the hops with the hover, adding in a clap of the heels as well.  The first standing sequence moves from chair through warrior 1 to side plank and crazy dog.  Budig then holds in a squat, optionally moving into crow pose.  Next comes what she calls the ""archer sequence"""":  she performs warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and side angle poses, all while doing a bow and arrow with the arms.  This series ends with standing splits, practicing a hop in this position as well.  The next sequence includes triangle pose with bind, half moon, half fish, and ""Thriller"" push-ups (from half fish, rocking forward onto the hands and pushing up).  This is followed by what Budig calls ""Ninja"" hops, or hopping forward on the tippy toes from down dog position.  The final standing series includes standing hand-to-foot, warrior 3, crescent, and revolved crescent.  Budig then performs dolphin pose, practicing hops from this position (i.e., hoping into forearm balance--note that she does NOT use a wall to assist).  Coming to the floor, Budig performs two rounds of wheel followed by happy babies pose.  Finishing postures include cross-leg reclined twist, full seated forward bend, and double pigeon.  Budig again sets up for savasana but does not allow any time for the actual relaxation.  Although most of this routine was solidly intermediate, Budig moved into the advanced ranges at times with her frequent forays into balancing on the hands.

YOGA POSES DEMYSTIFIED (8.5 minutes)
There are 4 segments to this section:  1) Block Exercise (Tiny Little Package)--Budig uses a block to discuss keeping the shoulders in alignment, 2) Half Moon Pose--Budig uses a block to assist with achieving this posture, 3) Crow Pose--Budig shows how to learn this posture by squatting on a block, and 4) Headstand--Budig explains how to attain the balance needed for Tripod headstand.

Budig has a young, hippy-type vibe, and she IS very encouraging despite the fact that she doesn't provide much form information.  The practices on this DVD would probably be most appropriate for those who are already experienced yoga practitioners but who enjoy playing around with taking things to a more advanced level.  In addition, Budig is likely to appeal most to those who are already fit and flexible.",1339545600,21,4962,4.945652173913044
4465603,5,B004TFTE90,"I love this video! I reviewed it prior to use, which I suggest everyone do. Normally, I prefer my Yoga DVD workouts to be filmed outside, mostly with a beach/ocean back drop, or a lake of some kind and mountains. I'm a pisces, and I just connect with water, what can say?! But this was filmed in a very beautiful loft; high ceilings, hardwood floors, pocket doors at the very back of the loft pushed wide open giving the space that indoor/outdoor living feel. The minimal white furniture with beautiful accent pillows and white flowing curtains was totally acceptable; so needless to say, I DIDN'T HATE IT! lol. Usually workout DVDs done in a studio just bore me to death for some reason.

I decided to skip the beginner section and go straight to intermediate. I'm still trying to decide if this was a mistake! (haha) The beginner section is pretty beginner-ish, the intermediate however, is more at the advanced level if you ask me. I wanted a video that didn't have the same old Yoga moves, but ones that challenged me, and this definitely did that! I moved through the workout, I accepted the challenging poses, attempted them, and if I wasn't able to do them I just told myself I'll get better with time. Let me tell you, I STILL don't know how she gets into some of the poses, but I'm determined to get there! I know one thing, I didn't wanna cop out and go back to the beginner workout, that's for sure. I thought about the workout all night, and couldn't wait to do it again, anxious to improve.

If  you are a beginner, then start with the beginner section. I read several reviews where people seem frustrated that this is not for beginners, but I feel the beginner section is truly a starting point, and not overwhelming if you have only minimal experience with the practice of Yoga. Heck, I consider myself somewhat of a beginner, and I loved the intermediate section even though I sucked at it! Just do what you can; this is the point, be cautious not to injure yourself and you'll be fine.

I find Kathryn full of bright, easy energy. She has a great body, gorgeous skin, and she smiles throughout this workout; I was encouraged and motivated and love how she doesn't take herself too seriously. Another thing I appreciated was how down to earth she was, and how she focused more on the physical benefits of the practice verses constant yapping about New Age ideology and what not. I really don't need all that. She does mention moving away from fear and being present, which I can appreciate.

If you want to challenge yourself, and move away from your run of the mill Yoga workout, get this. Kathryn is truly refreshing in her approach!!",1338681600,5,2652,4.551362683438155
4465604,5,B004TFTE90,"What I love about this dvd is that Kathryn doesn't keep you stagnant in a beginners level. I feel like she is preparing/challenging me to move ahead.
Everyday I feel stronger, I feel more able and more inspired... and I know that I will keep moving ahead, rather than staying where I've been. I love how Kathryn brings yoga down to earth and gives me a sense of accomplishment in my practice.
I feel that a lot of yoga dvds and teachers don't challenge me to move beyond level I/II and I end up feeling bored or just plain stuck. After this dvd I don't feel bored or stuck. I want to try more and more challenging poses because after doing this dvd, I know I can... definitely inspiring and motivating.",1336176000,6,702,4.366412213740458

I'll do that to relax!"" I enjoyed it, and I can certainly do it, but I think for TOTAL beginners it is too difficult. I personally know people who would be turned off to yoga if they truly thought this is where you begin to work your way up. It's not folks, don't worry. Yoga can be much easier than this. If you're trying for a nice, relaxing yoga session, I would definitely start with The Crunch Candlelight Yoga with Sarah Ivanhoe. If you're looking for a great introduction to energizing Power Yoga start here. For yoga newbies, YES...there IS a difference in yoga styles! Definitely work your way into Power...it's much different. That being said, this DVD is good and enjoyable.

The pace was quick so I felt a cardio sweat going but holding some of the poses gave me a relaxed stretch. I liked her instruction, although she seemed late on a few basic exercises, but nothing that turned me off from the workout. I also enjoyed that it wasn't sun salutationed to death. I love sun salutations, but some workouts make it most of the workout and very little of much else. She can come off a little new agey, which some folks do not like, but this did not distract or annoy me.",1331510400,2,613,4.339130434782609

As an intermediate yogi I feel this DVD is good for me. It is challenging, but I can do all the poses and exercises on the DVD. Here are some of the features I did and did not like about this DVD:

Things I like about this DVD:

-I think this is a great DVD to prepare one for inverted poses. There are little exercises thrown in throughout both the beginner and intermediate practices to help build arm strength and balance.

-The voice over is very motivating, Katheryn (the instructor)offers great encouragement along with the instructional dialogue.

-There is a very helpful section on this DVD where some of the more challenging poses are broken down and explained in a very helpful step-by-step way.

-The set is simple and peaceful. This is important to me because it sets the mood and tone of the workout.

-The whole energy and atmosphere of the workouts are fun and youthful and bouncy. Very motivating!

Things I don't like about this DVD:

-The camera work does not always follow Katheryn's movements well and sometimes it is a little hard to see what she is doing.

-Some of the poses are not mentioned in the voice over. This only happens a couple of times, but it is annoying when you are in Downward Dog, not looking at the screen, and then the next pose mentioned is a standing pose with no transition. This only happens once or twice, so it's not the end of the world, just mildly annoying.

-Sometimes the voice over does not keep up with what is going on in the video.",1330128000,2,1822,4.460843373493976
4465611,5,B004TFTE90,"I love this video! I am in very good shape--I run 5-6 miles 4-5 days a week. This video challenges my body and makes me sweat. I had a hard time finding the perfect yoga video for me. I wanted something that moved a little quicker than your typical yoga practice, but at the same time still felt like yoga. I also wanted something that would make me feel like I worked my body as opposed to just relaxing and stretching. This video fit the bill perfectly for my more athletic tastes. I highly recommend this video if you're in shape and want a challenge in strengthening, stretching, and balancing your body.",1330128000,,608,4.4375
4465612,5,B004TFTE90,I really like this yoga DVD.  The instructor uses fun variations of familiar poses!  It's a great workout but not for beginners!  If you practice yoga and are looking for a fun/challenging workout--check this one out!,1330041600,,217,4.972222222222222
4465613,2,B004TFTE90,"With over 25 years of practice under my belt, I occasionally look for something new, because I sometimes feel stuck in a rut.  My primary focus is, and always will be, Hatha yoga, but I've done everything but Bikram.  Bikram just doesn't appeal to me.  At my age, the last place I want to be is an overheated room.

Kathryn is a fresh face, and the product description sounded interesting.  I watched the video before I tried it; I always do that.  I noticed she moves pretty fast; that was a red flag.

Of course, watching and doing are still different.  After watching, I started the practice, and I did it a few times.  I found she moves way too fast.  Yes, I can do all these poses, but running through sun salutations so quickly, I had great difficulty maintaining balance.  I know how to modify a routine, so I started skipping some poses to maintain a reasonable pace.  It was a less than satisfying experience.  I play my edge, but I don't practice to feed my ego.

Then there's the hopping.  You're in Downward Facing Dog, and she says to jump your feet up in a manner that would resemble kneeling, upside down in mid-air.  I did it.  I didn't see the point, but I did it.  THEN, she says to clap the soles of your feet together while jumping, a move that made me feel like a trained seal.  This business would appeal to me as a game, but not as yoga practice.  And there is no point, except, as Kathryn squeals, to ""have fun!""

It sounded like someone was doing jumping jacks in my living room.  This isn't yoga.  It's twisting and tumbling like a five-year-old.

In the arrow series, Kathryn instructs you to pretend you're an archer, while you're in Warrior II.  The series is, essentially, variations on Warrior with twists.  For example, she says to pull an ""arrow"" from your ""quiver"" (reach behind your shoulder with your front hand) and aim toward your back leg.  Since you're ""holding your bow"" in your back hand, you do a spinal twist while you're in Warrior.  This series I felt was interesting, and the instructions were very clear.  It is, unfortunately, the only worthy portion of the workout.  Therefore, I do not recommend this DVD.",1329955200,17,2156,4.496124031007752
4465614,4,B004TFTE90,"I found this practice acceptable - challenging enough for me to enjoy. She has quite a few poses that I have not seen, and does some interesting pose combinations. The pace was a bit too fast, in my opinion, but I could manage with it. It was also a bit shorter than I like - about 50 minutes, but still good enough.

The music was pleasant, quiet and Eastern. Though Kathryn seems to say all the ""right"" yoga comments, the way she says them lacks the depth and maturity that I find in Shiva Rea or Janet Stone, who having spent time in India have a more serious and deeply spiritual approach to their practice.

I don't keep many yoga DVDs, but I'm keeping this one. While it won't be a favorite, it will add a certain interest and variety to my collection.",1329091200,,758,4.293706293706293
4465615,5,B004TFTE90,"One of my new years resolutions was to write more reviews for Amazon because I depend on them myself, and Kathryn Budig's DVD was the first purchase this year that motivated me to actually fulfill my resolution.
I have been teaching yoga for 6 years and have seen countless DVDs and different instructors.  However, I can say that I have enjoyed Kathryn's offering far more than any other in recent memory.  She is simply excellent.  This is an incredible value, I've recommended it to all my students and I'm sure will be playing it for many years to come.  Thank you, Kathryn.",1328400000,,578,4.637254901960785
4465616,5,B004TFTE90,"I ordered this because it was cheap and had good reviews. This is truly a great yoga dvd for beginners. I did it today and was truly breaking a sweat. I was so excited to get back to doing some yoga because it's low intensity, great stretch, and just makes me feel good all over. That feeling was what this DVD gave to me. It is going to be so addictive. She does go quickly between poses but it's fluid and not difficult to catch on to. I would definitely recommend this is you are a beginner.",1328313600,,494,4.103092783505154
4465617,5,B004TFTE90,"Awesome dvd!!! All you need is a mat and a set of blocks.  The section of the dvd where katheryn explaines some yoga poses step by step is great, and she moves slow enough so you can keep up.  The beginners section is vigorous enough to get your heart pumping and work up a little sweat. After finishing the advanced section, your body will definitely know it had a workout!!! I would recommend this dvd to anyone looking for an at home yoga practice.
Namaste.",1328227200,,460,4.4
4465618,4,B004TFTE90,"I find the 25 minute beginners practice to be a perfect post-workout stretch, and the 45 minute authentic flow to be challenging! Kathryn is a very good instructor (even though I mess up often in the authentic flow) and I sweat like crazy.",1327276800,,239,4.5813953488372094
4465619,3,B004TFTE90,"Maybe I just picked the wrong dvd but it said it had a beginners practice on it, so thought I'd try it.  I am 50+ and athletic but new to yoga.  I found the beginners too fast paced for me.  Really hard to follow along at that speed.  She doesn't explain enough for me what to do for each position.  When I finally get it, she's on to another.  So, if you are learning, there might be another slower paced dvd easier to follow.",1327017600,7,427,4.023809523809524
4465620,5,B004TFTE90,"I usually steer clear of yoga videos with all the corn-ball music and hosts, but Kathryn Budig is amazing.  I appreciate her respect for yoga and its connection with self.  I also love how she is fun and insightful, but not in an overbearing 'granola' sort of way.

The beginner's section of this DVD is great to get you warmed up for the actual 'Aim True' flow yoga practice.  Believe me - I was not expecting to be worn out after a beginner's session! However, it gets you flexible and mindfully ready to practice the flow video.  Now the 'Flow' segment of the DVD is fabulous - its around 45 minutes and it gets intense, but Kathryn's style of instruction helps to maintain balance and serenity even when your body is begging to just get out of a pose.

For the price... this DVD is beyond worth it. After experiencing this practice I would have paid $20 easily.  Kathryn has a daily web yoga diary via another yoga site that can be accessed on her website.  Can't wait till she comes to my city!",1327017600,4,999,4.391304347826087
4465621,5,B004TFTE90,"Before buying this DVD I had never heard of Kathryn Budig.  The 1st time I watched this DVD I just fell in love with her enthusiastic, fun, fearless practice.  This DVD has 2 routines, one aimed at beginners and one intermediate. They are both lovely but the 45 min intermediate sequence is one of my all-time favorites.  It is different than any others I have on DVD... more fun.  Kathryn's inspiring words and heart openers remind me to ""move away from fear"" in my practice, and in everyday life.  I highly recommend Aim True Yoga. Practicing this beautiful, challenging, energetic routine will leave you with a smile for the rest of the day!",1326672000,2,644,4.663716814159292
4465622,5,B004TFTE90,"I really love this DVD. It is surprisingly fun, challenging and playful. A lot of reviewers have already stated the positives so I won't do that, but I just really wanted to say Kathryn needs to make another one and soon :). You will sweat a lot with this one especially if you do the Intermediate one :). LOVE LOVE LOVE. Buy this!",1326585600,,331,4.26984126984127
4465623,5,B004TFTE90,"First off, one must know that the cover photo used of Kathryn Budig can be rather intimidating and off-putting... She is widely known for her ""Next-level arm balancing"" and rightfully so... Which also piqued my curiosity when perusing the abundant selection of yoga DVDs that flood the market. I sucked it up and purchased it knowing that I could always re-sell it if I didn't find it to be useful in any way.

It took me  month to crack open the plastic. Don't be me.

The breakdown of poses in the YOGA POSES DEMYSTIFIED alone warrant my purchase price. I had difficulty with my CROW POSE but after seeing her break it down in an unusual manner, I am now confident in what is sure to be the beginning of a beautiful relationship with arm balances. Considering that I am a heavier girl, this is an absolute achievement in which I did not think it would ever be possible.

Her easy-going persona is probably why she is popular as a yoga instructor.

The BEGINNER'S PRACTICE is great as a quickie to start the day, as well...

And he AUTHENTIC FLOW will have you breaking out in a sweat and smiling.

It truly is a ""FUN, FRESH, AND INSPIRING"" DVD to add to the collection.

Also, GAIAM is synonymous with quality.",1326067200,7,1212,4.4772727272727275

4465625,3,B004TFTE90,"This video is ok.  The moves are fast, and not what I'm used to.  She is quick witted, and sometimes funny...but a little granola-y.  The length of the routine was good, for a quick at home yoga fix.",1325894400,3,199,4.184210526315789
4465626,5,B004TFTE90,"This review is for the Intermediate Authentic Flow and the Poses Demystified sections of this DVD.  I am in love with this DVD!  I have been practicing yoga regularly for the last 2 years, and here and there 2 years before that.  I would say that my level right now is low-level intermediate.

The Authentic Flow sequence in this dvd is perfect for me.  It is challenging enough where I break a sweat, but it's not too hard as to seem impossible.  And I love that she gives you the tools to work on kicking up/floating into inversions.  I'm not quite there yet, but Kathryn's dvd has helped me tremendously.  I think I can be floating soon if I keep up with this practice.  And that is what I love about this dvd, I get home and I can't wait work on my practice with her.

The Poses Demystified section is an easy step-by-step guide using straps and blocks to get you into the poses that once seemed impossible to do.  She breaks down each movement in easy to follow instructions that make sense.  My pet-peeve with other yoga instructors is when they use language that doesn't make sense, like ""melt your heart down"" or ""pull in your thighs""... I'm sorry but I don't know what that means.  Pull in my thighs where??? How???  Kathryn doesn't use any on this nonsense language.  She's direct and straight to the point.  LOVE HER!!!",1325116800,,1330,4.45643153526971
4465627,4,B004TFTE90,"I'm a yoga beginner going in with some knowledge of yoga moves and breathing that I've done with some of my bellydance dvds. But doing just straight up yoga is new to me. That being said, I've been doing the beginner routine from this dvd and I've enjoyed it. At first viewing it seemed to go a little bit fast, but with the next viewing I was keeping up no problem. Some of the moves are still a little out of reach for me, but I try and hopefully I'll get there with more practice. I skimmed through some of the other routines on the dvd and don't see myself getting there anytime soon but it's good to know that this dvd can be a companion for me to continue my practice with even into harder levels. I had tried some other yoga dvds in the past for beginners and this has been my favorite and has been the only one I've kept up doing a few times a week. I'd definitely recommend this to someone looking to venture into yoga.",1323561600,,928,4.132596685082873

I have been practicing for over a year now, I feel I am tittering between beginner and intermediate, and I have been looking for a challenge for quite some time. I feel this practice definitely takes me there and beyond, leaving me breathless and my heart pounding throughout the Authentic Flow sequence. Kathryn is fun and energizing, leaving you wanting to smile the entire time and to continue through the tough poses, she makes you know it is okay to get up and try again. I recommend watching the sequences through so you know what is expected of you and what pace it is set at. It is terrific fun and definitely a must have for any yogi looking to get stronger!",1322524800,,739,4.4411764705882355
4465630,4,B004TFTE90,"I have done yoga off and on for years, but recently began to practice regularly. I am still at a beginners level and have been doing the beginner workout on this video. It moves faster than I would like, but is a great yoga workout. I like to really hold poses and feel them and this is more of a quick flow. The good thing is that it pushes me into more vigorous activity, which is great for me. I enjoy it and can see a strengthening in my upper body from this DVD. I am glad it has an advanced workout as well, when I find the beginners too easy I will move up to the next workout.",1322179200,2,584,3.9159663865546217
4465631,5,B004TFTE90,"I purchased this yoga DVD on a whim, and am very pleased. I did not know anything about Kathryn Budig before buying this, but have developed a massive yoga teacher crush on her. Her patter (the talking during poses) is inspiring but not hokey. She makes everything seem effortless, such as when she floats up to the front of the mat during a sun salutation. She also guides you to begin floating on your own. Instead of just taking a hop, she has you think about lifting up and bringing your knees into your chest and your hips over your shoulders. Even if you think you can't do it, she encourages you to try. (And it's true: the more you work, the easier it gets.)

I would not recommend this disc for beginners. Although Budig provides guidance for perfecting alignment within a pose, I didn't feel like there was much instruction on how to establish the poses. She also works toward advanced movements. If you're just getting started, it's better to focus on establishing a good down dog rather than working on a dolphin.

The only area I did not like thus far is the warrior sequence in the longer practice. With all the rotating, it's very easy to get confused about which hand is doing what. I hope that with continued practice, I can make more sense of this.

If you're an intermediate yoga student looking for a good practice, I would heartily recommend this DVD. Budig will guide you and inspire you.",1322006400,3,1410,4.543307086614173

Finally, Kathryn Budig hits the mark by integrating personal growth, spiritual peace, and FUN in this DVD yoga practice. She has a fresh approach that welcomes beginners as well as advanced yogis.  I really enjoy her challenges that seem at first to be too much (such as doing mini hand stands), but with Kathryn's coaching and encouragement, I am trying things I never thought I would.

In just a few sessions I am able to do crow pose and tripod headstand. Kathryn is a lovely teacher and the pace is just right. It is challenging, yet doable and I like having the choice of 2 practices. The poses demystified is wonderful addition. I would have given this 5 stars if shavasana would have either been done in a voice-over or just some relaxing music. Instead it just ends and goes back to the menu music. Many DVDs do this and it is a shame.",1321660800,,564,4.18348623853211

4465635,5,B004TFTE90,"I bought this DVD wanting to get into balance poses. I have not taken a yoga class, but have done lots of yoga via DVD's for many years. The beginning sequence of this DVD is challenging and I wouldn't recommend it for a flat out beginner. It will take me several times to remember so I don't have to watch my laptop screen.

Kathryn's enthusiasm is infectious. All my other yoga DVD's are very monotone - this is the complete opposite. There is plenty of talking, but it's not tedious to listen to. You can hear the smile behind Kathryn's voice. The background music, or ""muzak"" as another reviewer called it, is not typical yoga music. It is fast paced. I really enjoyed it.

There is a ten minute section where Kathryn goes over some poses and gives you tips on how to achieve them.

Overall, I am really happy with my purchase and will be seeking out Kathryn's other DVD's.",1321315200,,877,4.434782608695652

This DVD also gets you to try some things that are really not widely encouraged in most Yoga studios - which adds to the fun-factor.  The pacing is extremely fast, however, and it may take several run-throughs until you can actually follow along. Even the beginner's sequence isn't exactly beginner-friendly. People who are truly new to Yoga might find this a little confusing and frustrating, especially at first.
Other than that, it's an excellent heart-pumping workout with some fun extras; The explorations of arm balances and other tricky poses are something you don't see offered on a lot of DVDs. Budig's attention to anatomy and alignment and her lighthearted teaching style bring a fresh new perspective and make things fun and adventurous.",1321056000,8,899,5.157534246575342

The sequence of asanas is different than a lot of other DVDs I've done so I haven't gotten bored with it.

It is Hatha yoga with a real mind body connection at the center of the video, in an energizing way.

I found the shorter beginner's workout to be more challenging that most of the beginner-level yoga DVDs I've worked through over the years, and this was good, because it's good to be challenged and have something to work toward.  I had expected I could do the longer workout, but that one is still a bit beyond me.  I'll keep trying it, and try to achieve more of it each time.  Kathryn Budig is a fun (I want to say adorable) instructor.  Hope she continues to put more of these out.",1320883200,2,606,4.271929824561403
4465640,2,B004TFTE90,"Unfortunately, it's yoga like this that is why I switched from vinyasa based yoga to kundalini yoga. I have been practicing yoga for 14 years, and when I began I loved sun salutations. The way most yoga is oriented around them and emphasizes coming into them between every pose eventually dampened my enthusiasm.

Nonetheless, I was looking for a DVD to help with arm strength, and while this definitely could fit the bill, I really disliked the overall vibe of the disc. The background music borders on muzak, and the routine winds up feeling too rushed, at the expensive of some important stuff. For one, alignment is really given the blow off, and this isn't good as I wound up with a really painful neck after doing the intermediate practice. Second, once you come down into savasana the disc ends and goes into the very unrelaxing menu music. I hate when discs just .. stop when you're doing what's supposed to be one of the most important poses. I did the intermediate workout because 25 minutes is much shorter than I'd like to do. However, I found myself really frustrated. It felt like Kathryn spent the entire routine wishing she was doing handstand, and nudging the rest of us to join her. I didn't feel comfortable doing a lot of these high hops without someone to check my posture (and as I thought- ouch afterwards).

I feel like this is the worst kind of American yoga, where the focus is mostly on the same goals as your average gym routine, with a little bit of self-esteem building built in. Kathryn didn't even remind us very often about breathing, which at least I can usually count on in vinyasa based routines.",1320192000,73,1632,4.624137931034483

I've watched and practiced the beginner (20 min.) exercise at least 15 times and I'm still hearing something new. Whenever I'm starting to feel tight in my neck and shoulders, I go through the exercises and it's like my body's been hit with a ""reset"" button.

4465645,5,B004TFTE90,"I've been a Kathryn Budig fan for years now. I remember stumbling across her YouTube channel and gawking at her complete command of arm balances, not to mention her absolute beauty. I had an opportunity to take one of her classes in Winter 2010, and remember thinking, ""She's on the verge of something, I just don't know what."" I realize in hindsight that I was probably practicing the prototype of what is now Aim True Yoga. With Gaiam's help, Kathryn's brought this style to life in her new DVD, which exudes bubbly personality and precious femininity.

Basic Flow

This 25 minute practice is great for any skill level and every day practice. It goes by in a flash, but still gives you the challenges necessary for a legitimate workout. Kathryn introduces you to this practice by emphasizing the importance of trust, love and a good sense of humor. She uses phrases like ""petite cobra"" and ""move from a place of truth"" in time with an eclectic soundtrack that keeps you moving. Kathryn not only demonstrates the practice, but also provides the voiceover, which is conversational and light. It's like listening to a girlfriend give you a pep talk. Sheer white drapes hang from high ceilings that enhance the sense of space for your practice.

Authentic Flow

This 45 minute practice is not for the faint of heart! Kathryn lets the viewer know that she's stepping up the challenge. ""As long as you stay true to your intention, you always hit your mark and you aim true."" The physical challenge is coupled with encouragement to let go of fear and ""move back into a place of love"". Kathryn certainly has today's modern yogini in mind. The DVD's urban apartment setting is suited to the single working woman who needs a space to call her own. The practice integrates core and upper body exercises in addition to Kathryn's archer sequence, basically comprised of virabhadrasana variations.

Yoga Poses Demystified

This 10 minute workshop-style snippet is Kathryn's breakdown of a couple concepts and poses. TLP is ""tiny little package"", which is basically utilizing the size of your average yoga block as a measuring stick for proper alignment of arms, shoulders, pikes and floats. TLP is the foundation for her break down of half moon pose, crow pose and headstand. Great for novices and excellent review for the veterans.

The DVD also includes an exclusive interview with Kathryn (and her dog Ashi) that covers a few questions about the Aim True philosophy and her personal yoga journey. Overall, the Aim True Yoga DVD is feel-good and girly. Kathryn does not allow you to take your practice too seriously and encourages you to have a sense of humor whilst pushing yourself to your edge.

Strengths:

Aesthetically feminine with soft watercolors and spacious settings
Musically dynamic, focusing on grooving rhythms to encourage flow
Accessible and challenging for any skill level, beginner to expert

Recommended for those who:

Need an at-home resource for personal practice
Are new to yoga and want to get familiar with postures and sequences
Want the grassroots philosophy of yoga without the esoteric terminology

4465646,5,B004TFTE90,"I am sort of new to yoga, but kinda not new to yoga.  I took a series of intro yoga classes at a studio about a year and a half ago, but for some reason didn't continue with it.  I'm revisiting yoga and wanted to take another series of intro classes, but couldn't find any that fit my schedule.  So I decided to take a chance on this DVD after seeing the positive reviews.

(I've only done the beginner's practice, so my review is based on that.  Just an FYI).  If you're looking for breakdowns of poses and notes on form then look elsewhere.  There is a special section where Kathryn shows you how to do some of the more advanced poses like crow and I think forearm stand, but there is no tutorial on basic poses like DFD, chaturanga, and the Warrior poses.  If you're already sort of familiar with basic yoga poses and are just looking to get your body loosened up and used to being in positions like plank and downward facing dog, then Aim True is the DVD for you.  If you enjoy yoga, or think you might enjoy yoga, but sometimes don't really want all that chanting and spiritual talk, Aim True is for you.  Kathryn DOES discuss things like ""letting it all go"" and ""this is a space for you"" which is perfectly fine for me and her personality and humor in the beginner's practice comes off as sweet and endearing.  She encourages you to just try the poses, see how they fit your body.  It's relaxing yet challenging, which is exactly what I was looking for.",1317686400,,1459,4.304029304029304
4465647,5,B004TFTE90,i love kathryn's aim true dvd!  it's so very... kathryn.  her ability to break down her favorite poses and bring some  humor to yoga is really wonderful.  kathryn has a unique teaching style and i'm not sure how someone could not love her and aim true.,1317600000,,252,4.413043478260869
4465648,5,B004TFTE90,"I found this DVD to be utterly perfect. I enjoy Kathryn's playful style, while she creates a powerful practice. This is the dream DVD for me to have in my home so that I can practice at my leisure. Buy it. You will be thrilled you did!",1317600000,,235,4.0212765957446805
4465649,3,B004TFTE90,"Although I am a huge fan of Kathryn's, I was not impressed by this dvd.  I found it redundant and more of an excersice dvd than something of a mind/body practice.  Now, maybe because I am a yoga practitioner and teacher myself, I might have a different view, so even though I was not into it doesn't mean someone else won't be.  I did however enjoy Kathryn's narration and some of the posture breakdowns, as far as a daily practice.....no thank you.",1317254400,15,449,4.451219512195122
8440629,4,B004TFTE90,"This is a pretty good video. I am an intermediate yoga student and the beginner session is very simple, good instructions. The more advanced workout is more difficult, and there were poses that I cannot do. She does however have a nice tutorial on how to do some of the more advanced poses that had good tips, so I'll try again. I didn't love the music in this, it wasn't very peaceful which is the only reason I only give it 4 stars. Otherwise it's a nice, inexpensive DVD to add to your collection. I really liked the instructor, and ordered her book as well.",1527724800,,561,4.352380952380952
8440630,5,B004TFTE90,The flows are great but I hope they made videos where in the instructor is teaching the class instead of having music and voice overs,1511308800,,133,4.36
8440631,4,B004TFTE90,"Music and instruction (for the 2 workouts on the DVD) were too fast-paced, this made it difficult to relax and enjoy the workout. Not everyone will feel the same as I.

- If you are a YOGA beginner or have old injuries, I would stick with the BEGINNER workout, until you are ready for the 2nd, more advanced workout. I usually have to modify moves/poses myself.
- Did NOT enjoy how much she talked, while repeatedly reminding you of the title ""Aim True"".
- Great workouts though, but I'll be muting and playing my own music instead.",1510012800,,532,4.484536082474227
8440632,3,B004TFTE90,"Pretty good.  I'm challenged and will continue to work at it.  The moves are a bit hard for an advanced beginner as I am...54 yr old, flexible but lacking upper body strength but I can do most of the moves, just not as quickly or with as much finesse.  It has a common flow, it's the kick jumps that get me.",1498780800,,307,4.0
8440633,4,B004TFTE90,This is a great yoga video for all levels of practice. The step by step instructions for difficult poses is easy to follow and learn from.,1483488000,,138,4.346153846153846
8440634,5,B004TFTE90,"Best yoga video I've ever done!!! The instructor is pleasant, skilled, and a good communicator, and the workout is fantastic! I've been doing yoga for a few years, so each of the 3 levels gives me something different, depending on what I'm in the mood for. I do the beginner practice on an easy day, or when I want a good stretch. It would be perfect for someone just starting out in yoga. The intermediate is awesome for a good workout, but you still feel refreshed afterward. It is somewhat fast-paced, which I enjoy (keeps me from getting bored, lol). It has a good mix of stretching and strengthening, so I feel like I was actually challenged and got a workout in. The movements are familiar enough that it's easy to follow, but there are also some new combinations/poses to give me something to work up to. I haven't done the advanced workout yet. Mostly because I love the intermediate workout so much that I've just been sticking with that one. :) Only caution is for the people with weak wrists (like me)...your wrists might get a bit sore/tired with this workout, or you might need to grab some dumbbells to hold onto during planks, etc. to take some of the pressure off. One of my favorite workouts ever!",1469404800,,1214,4.5479452054794525
