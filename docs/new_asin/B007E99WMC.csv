8515124,5,B007E99WMC,"Love this series so much! Wonderful story and brilliant actors. Can't wait for the second season to come out.
As others have stated, this will not play on a standard US DVD player. You must have a region free dvd player or one that will play region 2 DVDs.",1427587200,,256,4.244897959183674
8515125,5,B007E99WMC,"Really, really enjoyed this program.  A sweet, funny story about a loving couple, their quirky kids and even quirkier extended family.  The characters are well written and developed and the way their stories are woven together is lovely.  After just a few episodes you feel as if you're part of the family (or wish you could be!).  Terry and Jan have the sort of relationship we all want to have, even after years of marriage and three kids, they're still in love.  Lars and Fergie are terrific, so are the kids, and I just want to hug Billy!  A really strong cast  every actor nailed the part.  I hope to see more of all of them!

I wish we had such great programming in the States -- I'm so tired of ""dramas"" that are nothing but sex, violence and foul language, and ""comedies"" that you wouldn't know were supposed to be funny without that constant, annoying canned laugh track.  This is a drama that makes you care about the characters, and a comedy that makes you smile and laugh because its truly funny.

My only ""complaint"" is that I haven't yet been able to find the second series on Amazon.  Please, please, please put it out on DVD!  You can't leave us hanging, not knowing what happens to Terry & Jan and all the rest!",1412726400,,1228,4.404444444444445
8515126,5,B007E99WMC,"Loved everything--the stories, the characters, the actors. Showed a real-life family with warmth, respect, & great humor. So disappointed it didn't go beyond two seasons. Brendan & Leslie are naturals as husband & wife, parents, & the foundation of the entire family. My favorite B.C. series.",1412640000,,292,5.369565217391305
8515127,4,B007E99WMC,"Warm, loving family. We need more shows like this. Terry and Jan and the brood make for an entertaining time.",1376092800,,109,4.5
8515128,5,B007E99WMC,"Wonderful family show. I love both Brendan Coyle and Lesley Sharp amazing actors. Worth getting it. Written very well, all characters deliver.........",1375574400,4,150,5.863636363636363
8515129,5,B007E99WMC,"This is a great show! Well written and acted! The music is also quite good; I hope there is a soundtrack at some point. There are a lot of familiar faces for viewers of British TV and they fit together very well in this family drama. The storylines are solid, there are wonderful poignant moments, and the laughs are plentiful. Brendan Coyle fans won't be disappointed but you'll very quickly become fans of the show and the other actors. Don't miss the out-takes bonus on the second disk - great stuff.
TECHNICAL NOTE: You will have to by a multi-region, multi-format DVD player in order to play it in the U.S.- even my computer wouldn't play it. Totally worth the extra purchase since I'll be buying Season 2 as soon as it's released on DVD.",1368057600,4,743,4.511111111111111
8515130,5,B007E99WMC,"I bought this because I'm a big fan of Brendan Coyle (Bates) on Downton Abbey.  He plays the father, Terry Starling, in a four-generation family sharing a rather small house. His father has moved in with Terry and his wife Jan. They also have three children, two grown and one a teenager. And the oldest daughter has just had a baby after breaking up with her longtime boyfriend.  Soon Jan's nephew and Terry's half-brother show up as well.

This is not Shakespeare, it's a series about an assimilated modern family.  Brendan Coyle's character is completely different from Mr. Bates, and yet like Bates, he's decent, hard-working, honorable, and a bit of a romantic. It's a series with heart that will make you cheer for the characters.

A word of warning - be sure you DVD player will Region 2 PAL format discs before you buy this or you'll be very disappointed.",1359590400,11,863,4.688741721854305
