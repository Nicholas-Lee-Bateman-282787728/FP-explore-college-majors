8138717,5,B000HDE0JM,"Her instructions aren't the best verbally but there's a menu going through the steps.  You will catch on fast,  I love the DVD and it's been a huge help for me",1460419200,,159,4.096774193548387
8138718,1,B000HDE0JM,"This DVD plays more like a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch than a workout video. The instructor is upbeat and attractive, and clearly knows how to dance. But, her back-up dancers are ridiculous. The taller one on the left is awkward, flails around, and makes me feel uncomfortable watching her. The shorter woman on the right seems lost, confused, and her pigeon-toed feet aren't helping much, either. (I have nothing against pigeon-toes, but for a professional fitness DVD?? Couldn't there have been a more appropriate back-up dancer choice?!)

I paid $15.00 for this DVD at Target, and I am not happy. I am a workout and dance fanatic, and I will put up with some below-standard fitness DVDs for the sake of a good sweat session. However, this salsa DVD is so scattered and disjointed, with cues missing, moves randomly thrown in, and a total lack of synchronicity among the dancers, that there is no way I will even attempt to follow the workout. Also, as other members have pointed out, some moves are dangerous (neck rolls, random body rolls, and no prep time for your brain to let your body know what's coming next). An instructor repeatedly saying ""Just do whatever! Whatever you want to do with your arms is fine!"" doesn't scream good quality fitness training to me.

Lastly, my husband is a professional camera-man for film and TV. He would give me endless harassment if he knew I spent 15 bucks on a DVD this poorly executed. The background is generic, the camera work is boring (totally stagnant), and the lighting looks florescent. Overall, it looks like something a junior high school AV club made and then was broadcast on a public-access channel. (No offense, junior high AV clubs.)

Please don't make the same mistake I did. Instead, I recommend the ""Dancing with the Stars"" Latin Ballroom DVD -- much better! Also, Zumba is fantastic for dance, cardio, flexibility, and strength!",1325721600,,1893,4.854489164086687
8138719,1,B000HDE0JM,"Horrible sound. Instructor doesn't give instructions and, worst to my mind, has no feel for the music, no sense of rhythm. She hurls her body around, and her movements are jerky, not fluid as most dance requires. Plus, she does certain movements that are notoriously bad to do, such as backward neck rolls and abrupt squats mid-motion. And she calls it ""aerobic,"" which it isn't likely to be for anyone. Should be pulled from the market for both aesthetic and safety reasons!",1287100800,3,475,4.804878048780488
8138720,1,B000HDE0JM,"If you want to see  a really bad DVD , buy this one . IT is so bad that I could't believe it was in a store and even less in amazon. you can see that people are desperate to make money from whatever trash.",1260921600,2,205,3.5555555555555554
8138721,1,B000HDE0JM,"I have bought this DVD 7 months ago and tonight was my first time viewing the DVD. Sometimes, before I do a workout, I tend to view my new workouts DVDs and that's what I have done with this workout.

The instructor doesn't really gives cues. I like to be given cues, during an exercise. The instructor knew what she was doing, but her friends didn't. I don't know why she has chosen to do a workout video with her two friends, if they didn't know salsa. Maybe the two women were her students, but still, if your students haven't master the steps, don't use them. The backup women were lost in this video. One of the ladies. The tall one is the back, was striking poses. She wasn't even trying to do what the instructor was doing.

The video is not quality. Maybe the instructor should have done this video by herself or at least get other people that knew what they were doing.

I couldn't stop laughing, watching this video. I might try it later for the fun of it. When, I don't really want to be serious about working out, but just having fun. Who knows I might just get a good workout. If I try the video and get a good workout, I will edit this review. I kow that I will not be able to change my star rating, but I can put my new rating in my review.

If you want to try to video, try your library first, to see if they carry it and view it first. Don't buy this DVD, unless it's on sale for dirt cheap at a store or at a garage sale.",1260144000,5,1439,4.056338028169014
8138722,3,B000HDE0JM,"While I agree with the other reviewers that the technical aspect of this video leaves a lot to be desired I though overall it was OK. Its true she does not give much instruction and its a little tough to follow the first time but there is a little section in the menu in which she breaks down the steps. If you do that first it's fine. I have some dance experience so I found it a little easier to follow. I thought it was good from a work out stance. My legs were sore afterward. As with all dance, practice makes perfect. This gets a lot easier to follow the more you do it.",1233014400,3,576,4.017391304347826
8138723,1,B000HDE0JM,"I bought this at Marshall's and was psyched about doing a fun dance workout DVD.  Well, there is absolutely no instruction regarding steps or cueing.  The DVD begins with the instructor dancing away with no guidance as to how to start whatsoever.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the production quality is amateurish.  Do yourself a favor and read reviews on these DVDs first, then buy.  I did just that this weekend.",1231718400,3,425,4.767123287671233
8138724,1,B000HDE0JM,I bought this and was excited because I take latin cardio classes and wanted something for the days I don't go. First let me say my daughters have shot better video with their camera.  The instructor didn't give proper cues for following and her back up dancers(if they can be called that) were horrible and also found it hard to follow her. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this. I wouldn't even give this away for free. It's in recycables as I type this review. Would have given it .5 star but they didn't have it as a choice.,1183420800,13,547,4.310679611650485
