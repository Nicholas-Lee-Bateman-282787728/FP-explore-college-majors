866100,5,6304411448,I love love LOVE Benny and Joon! It's such a quirky love story and is one of my all time favorites. Johnny Depp is absolutely adorable in this movie and Sam is just a lovable character. I love the spin and the fact that its not a typical rom-com. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that's in the mood for a great Johnny Depp performance in a truly unique and somewhat realistic love story.,1514505600,,394,4.266666666666667
866101,5,6304411448,"One of my all time favorite movies.  It is  heart-warming, charming and an all around good movie.  My teen-age children also enjoyed it. Especially Johnny Depp's Charlie Chaplin bread dance scene and other silent film references. Love this movie..",1514160000,,247,5.282051282051282
866102,5,6304411448,My favorite movie of ALL time.  Will always be likely.  Best actors...Best story... and ends with grilled cheese.,1512172800,,113,5.222222222222222
866103,2,6304411448,"Quirky 90s movie that dates pretty badly today. A very young Johnny Depp plays a wacky old movie fan who dresses like Buster Keaton and sometimes acts like Charlie Chaplin. He falls for a mentally ill young woman who's being cared for by a protective but apparently controlling older brother (played by Aidan Quinn). Of course these two ""misfits"" fall in love.

Being a ""misfit"" is one thing, but suffering from a serious medical issue like schizophrenia is something else. Once again Hollywood decides that miracles are possible and that true love is so strong that it can even cure mental illness. Unlike ""A Beautiful Mind,"" the heartbreaking reality of psychological illness makes this ""feel good"" film hard to stomach.",1511654400,,722,5.016666666666667
866104,5,6304411448,"Simply gorgeous! Much enjoy this movie in every way...have watched it many times and each time has its own moments of interest as I move forward through different parts of my life. A great all time classic that cannot be portrayed like this again. The main 3 characters have their roles down so smoothly that you just cannot help but get lost in this story and identify with it on so many levels!

The writing - the writers did a really poor job of showing mental illness. The unrealistic portrayal didn't take away from the sweetness of the story though.

Actors - Mary Stuart Masterson looked a half beat behind the whole time. She looked like she was acting. Aidan Quinn and Julianne Moore were very human and believable. The supporting cast looked like real people. Johnnny Depp stole the show (of course). Wow, he really has a great body of work. He does such a great job with quirky characters. He gets into their soul and makes it visible to all those who would normally pass by these people without seeing them. He's awesome. It's worth watching the movie just for him.

867136,5,6304411448,"You know, had I watched Benny & Joon as my first Johnny Depp movie, I know I would've been better acclimated to Johnny Depp's weirdness.  By that I mean, there's an actual explanation behind his weird ways in Benny & Joon.  That is he has an apparent talent for dancing, performing and magic tricks.  This is actually mentioned in Benny & Joon.  All this time I was just calling him weird!

I admit for the first 30 minutes I thought this movie might be a little *too* weird.  You first see Johnny high up in a tree for no reason, and then he's involved in that bizarre restaurant scene (and saving people's dinners despite some swift rotating!) which reminds me of an impatient child who can't sit still for 5 minutes.  Then you have Mary pretending she's scuba diving (because this early on I didn't quite understand her condition or what the movie was exactly going for with her character).  But I'm glad I stuck with it.

When you see Johnny pretend that his hat is being kicked away during the park segment so he can never quite pick it up, well this is all a magic trick on Johnny's part, or when you see him slide across the kitchen floor as a unique/more efficient way of house cleaning... these unusual quirks are actually explained.  Had I watched this movie a long time ago (like in '93 when it was released) it probably would have made all the movies Johnny Depp starred in over the last 15 years more understandable.  Well just a *little* more understandable.  His character is still bizarre unless we're talking about Secret Window, one of the few Depp films I can actually follow.

The movie opens and end with a familiar favorite- the Proclaimers ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"".  While the song feels out of place unless you really dig deep and find a loose comparison between the lyrics and the meaning behind the movie, none of that matters because it's a good song!  The story is that Aidan Quinn's sister is mentally ill (played by Mary Stuart Masterson) but we don't know *how* ill until a certain bus scene later when she starts shaking and yelling, and just causing a scene.  This is when we see Johnny Depp's honest side, when he comes to terms that not even HE can rationalize Mary's behavior.  I want to make a joke here but I won't because it's sort of offensive.

Aidan is a mechanic and he likes to protect his sister from the outside world because he knows how harsh the world and other people can be.  Too bad later on he *over* protects her which results in making Mary's condition worse.  I have to say, Julianne Moore's character felt selfish to me.  She plays the hard to get girlfriend.  She showed a complete lack of sympathy whenever the subject of Aidan's complicated life came up, and I felt Aidan never should have bothered getting involved with her.  Just keep walkin' Julianne!  Also the hot woman who wanted to ask Aidan out to dinner for helping with car troubles?  Shouldn't have been included in the writing.  However here comes tree-climbing Johnny Depp looking a LOT younger than he really is (he was 30 when he played in this movie, but he looks like he's only 16).  Turns out after a card bet (that Mary was a part of) she lost and her punishment is having to bring home Johnny Depp.  No!  I think I'd rather just give away all the money in my possession!  I kid I kid. :)

However bringing him home is actually not a big deal because while at first Johnny's unorthodox way of house cleaning and sliding around the kitchen floor while listening to loud music is too much for Mary to handle, Aidan realizes he did a pretty darn good job cleaning up so he doesn't really understand Mary's complaints.  So Johnny comes back, and pretty soon he develops a relationship with Mary.  Maybe it's just me but the way Johnny and Mary eventually spill the beans to Aidan that they're in a relationship results in an abnormally violent reaction from Aidan.  He shouldn't have reacted *that* angrily.  I mean seriously, mentally ill or not, Mary's a grown woman for goodness sake!  Then again the way Johnny worded it, Aidan may have interpreted it as a sexual gesture.

Eventually Mary is checked into a mental hospital and it's up to Johnny and Aidan to work together (using Johnny's hat trickery of course) to get her out of there.  The movie gets really playful and adventurous during this point into the story.  Johnny Depp swinging around outside the window of Mary's room in an exaggerated attempt to visit her is just another trademark example of the kind of bizarre character Johnny likes to portray.  Perhaps if I could find one complaint it's that Aidan takes his character a bit too seriously.  Then again he's probably just portraying someone who's super protective of his sister.  Mary does a REALLY great job portraying a mentally ill person with all the unpredictable behavior and outbursts.  She's the star of the movie if you ask me, though Johnny gets all the attention because of his bizarre character.

But I seriously enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It has pretty good drama, well-written comedy so as not to take away from Mary's condition and keep things as light-hearted as possible, a tolerable amount of romance, and the adventurous stuff at the end is the icing on the cake.  I had to laugh seeing Oliver Pratt as a mechanic, even though he's aging tremendously well.  Seriously that guy should be a doctor giving other doctors advice!  Yeah I watch Chicago Med.",1467763200,,5425,4.590436590436591

867527,5,6304411448,"I cannot believe that I never watched this movie until now.
I wish that I had seen it a lot sooner.

Johnny Depp and Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson make a very interesting group of talents.
I have seen the three of them many times separately, but they were amazing all together.

This movie is very charming in an old fashioned way.

I enjoyed every minute of this movie.

This is the kind of movie that you could just relax and be entertained with - - there is no mystery to solve, no suspense, no jump scares, nothing gross, no plot twists, nothing to make you cry, no confusing ending - - it is just a sweet story with a happy ending.

This is a love story between two innocent people who don't want to hurt anyone but just want to love each other and find peace in their lives.

I have watched so many movies, but I think that this is truly the first time that I can honestly say that I loved all of the characters.

Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is mentally ill - - it is never said exactly what, but it looks like schizophrenia.

Nothing is exactly said about Sam (Johnny Depp) either, but I guessed right away that he is autistic because of his love for spinning at the very beginning, as well as his way of absorbing into himself and shutting everyone else out, and letting the world back in only when he wants to.

Benny (Aidan Quinn) is a really nice guy - - he is a hard worker who devotes his life to taking care of his sister, and then he takes the risk of taking in a complete stranger when he didn't have to.  When Benny starts to fall in love with the waitress, he is very concerned about avoiding hurting her before the relationship even has a chance.

This movie is also a complete fantasy, because we know that, in real life, mental illness and autism are very serious and dangerous, and exhausting for the caregiver.  This movie avoids the truth about all of that and only shows the lightest side.  There is one part where Joon is in the hospital, but she goes there by choice, and the movie does not make it look like a bad experience and adds a lot of comedy to it.

This is a movie that should have a remake or a sequel.",1466380800,4,2149,4.209756097560976

Movie synopsis from Google:
Benny (Aidan Quinn), who cares for his mentally disturbed sister, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), also welcomes the eccentric Sam (Johnny Depp) into his home at Joon's request. Sam entertains Joon while he dreams of a job at the video store. Once Benny realizes Joon and Sam have started a relationship, he kicks Sam out of the house. This leads to an altercation between brother and sister. Joon runs away with Sam, who soon realizes that she may need more support than he alone can provide.

872066,4,6304411448,"Benny & Joon is a romantic comedy film about how two eccentric individuals, Sam and Juniper,also known as ""Joon"",who find each other and fall in love. It stars Johnny Depp and Mary Stuart Masterson.

Benny runs a small car repair shop. He must also take care of his mentally ill sister Juniper, better known as Joon. After losing a bet, Benny is forced to bring another eccentric into his house. His name is Sam, the cousin of a friend. Not inclined to conversation, Sam expresses himself by performing Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton routines. Not surprisingly, he immediately hits it off with Joon. As Sam and Joon fall deeper in love, Benny for the first time in life experiences the pangs of jealousy.

Good acting,funny plot and great characters. Although there are some problems in the script and directing,the performances of the cast overshadowed them particularly Johnny Depp,who did extremely well as a physical comedian. His portrayal of Sam is delicately touching, a maladjusted waif with both soul and grit. Watch this for his performance alone. Added to that,Mary Stuart Masterson resists the temptation to soften Joon. That in itself made this movie compelling and worth watching.",1419638400,,1197,5.071065989847716

It covers how difficult it is to be a caregiver to someone in your immediate family. Thats the heavy part;  everything else is about comedy.  If you ever spent a Saturday night playing poker for small appliances and pure junk, you will love the concept.  It would be a wonderful way to skip re-gifting and just trade it for other things you do want.
This is the perfect movie for when you get lemons from life, make lemonade!  All the actors in this film really work well together to make this a hilarious movie.  Sometimes life is hard and it helps to rediscover your sense of humor.

This is a sweet movie about people living small lives in a small town.  People living large lives in a large town should be envious. It is so full of kindness that it almost  breaks  your heart,  However, the comedy side makes  you chuckle.  How long since you have actually chuckled!?

Benny and Joon is one of the best. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I did not see the movie until years after it was released but it has stood the test of time.

I always get a happy feeling when I'm watching this movie. It's definitely a fee good movie and the feeling sticks with me for quite a while. It is also not overly mushy. I would recommend this movie for teens to adults. It is a good story with a message without being preachy or heavy handed. A great cast, too. The soundtrack is wonderful. The score fits the movie so well. The characters in the movie seem like real people. Good dialogue and great acting. Johnny Depp is fantastic in this movie. He's a joy to watch.

873190,4,6304411448,"As a psychologist reviewing the film for possible use in a class for high school students, this film was a perfect fit!  It is a tender story of two eccentric characters, one of whom clearly has a mental illness and the other of whom might be a bit schizotypal but never exhibits psychotic symptoms.  The pair find each other and are drawn to the kindred spirit they each see in the other.  The film, by modern standards, provides a somewhat innocent look at a romance and apparently sexual relationship between two adults and addresses the pain that Joon feels at the assumption of society that she is not mentally competent to participate in such an adult relationship.  Naturally those assumptions don't diminish her longing for attachment, acceptance, and even romance.  Her slightly enmeshed relationship with her devoted-but-SLIGHTLY-overprotective brother is challenged by her new relationship and his concerns about her real tendency to have very serious psychiatric symptoms.  In the end, he trusts her to give life as an adult a try and finds he then has more room to grow a more fulfilling life for himself in the process - at least we all hope so!",1389744000,5,1159,4.887755102040816

873194,5,6304411448,I have loved Benny and Joon since it first came out and have watched it once a year since then.  Each character is developed and has something to love.

873263,3,6304411448,"There's a lot to like about this film but certain things nagged me into not liking it as well as some other viewers.

Here's the scoop. Joon is mentally ill (schizophrenia?) and her brother, who owns a auto repair shop can't bring himself to put her in a home. The constant attention she needs (he needs to giver her) has made it so he has no life. He wins a friend's cousin, Sam (Johnny Depp), in a card game. Sam himself is more than a bit weird but he and Joon get on well together. This begins to raise some other problems.

The set up is simple enough, but one major point nagged me to distraction. It was the Sam character. We don't know his story. He's illiterate, quiet, watches old films late at night and dresses much like the stars in silent films. He even goes through elaborate routines from films of days gone by and he's really good at it. So what's the scoop? Is HE mentally ill? Odd maybe. Ill? You just don't know. Who were his parents? His uncle was the one that pawned him off in the card game. How is it he got away, in this day and age, without an education? His love of silent film denotes a certain degree of romance but that just wasn't enough for me. And  then there's Benny. A strong handful of movies have been made involving an interdependent relationship where you ask yourself who's taking care of who. There was really nothing new added here.

Mary Stewart Masterson as Joon does a superb job. Aidan Quinn is good enough as Benny but it's not his best role. Julianne Moore is always good. Her part could have been written a bit better. Dan Hedaya is good in a woefully small role and William H Macy's role was so small he must have been doing someone a favor.

This is a decent enough movie. It's very likable and Depp really shines. It just couldn't deliver the goods for me. It might be more of a woman's film because it's aimed more at the heart. It's a good watch so don't pass it up on my word.",1384387200,,1931,4.2506811989100814

The only thing, though, is that although the more weird characters are very likeable, I wouldn't recommend necessarily considering them your ultimate role models.  Just because unfortunately society isn't geared to work that way.  But, for a little while, under of course, controlled circumstances and a safe two hour learning experience, it can be both very fun as well as beneficial to a person, to be crazy.  :)",1380326400,,509,4.738636363636363

Depp once again proves why he was and is one of Hollywood's best. Great movie, great cast as Julianne Moore was part of the supporting cast. Basically...long story short, Joon, played by Mary Stuart Masterson (from Law and Order fame) loses a poker game but by doing that she wins the heart of Benny (played by Depp). After the two of them fall in love, they try to set up her brother (played greatly by Aidan Quinn) for love..it's a lot of great mixes in it, some off beat humor along the lines. I'd recommend it. I found it to be a good movie at an awesome price",1376006400,2,700,4.116788321167883

Great movie about a family struggling to get by and the ray of sunshine a young oddball man brings to them.

Quinn's Benny has insulated Joon from the world at the sacrifice of his personal happiness, and is desperately seeking the best situation for Joon, and is sure Sam is not it!

873919,3,6304411448,"my takeaway is Sam swinging in front of the mental(?) hostpital where Joon is being isolated, what a wonderful exciting moment in the depths of despair for someone who sees no options n only fear from the past...  just perfection, who came up with that scene, I love you!!!  i did have problems with Joon's presentation of illness, just mumbles through thoughts and touches her face too much?? If you saw Shine, RainMan, Scent of a Woman you would see so much depth to a personal struggle from childhood trauma this is soooo much more believable and wonder what type of direction she got to express her 'condition'... I was amazed that Depp did his own falls on concrete like Charlie did and suffered limited consequences, at least as far as I can tell, Jack Sparrow didn't really limp did he???  what a beautiful, sexy man and is so believable in his character that one can't help but fall in love with a dang movie character, very very rarely happens and attributes Depp's abilities to translate such a complex character... I did not fully comprehend Aidan's relationship to Joon other than a shared tragedy and his inability to accept someone who improves his sisters situation is anathema to me, hence I recommend for JD fans and his physical comedy aspects which were until now unknown to me and am even more impressed with his acting skills, wish the music tracks were more aligned to the script as I am a huge Stevie Winwood fan but just did not work for this film, can't wait to see this again!!!",1367280000,,1504,4.604477611940299

He was so nutty and surreal, and yet he was grounded in reality, and worked between the lines with that aspect. ""Joon"" was crazy, yet lucid in unique ways that enabled her to see the weaknesses in others and know the why of it. The ""sane person"", Benny, was the one who was least 'in touch' with what was really going on in life, although on the surface it would seem that he was the normal one, who was able to do things ""right"", to function the way society says that we must.

I really do not know how anyone could see this movie and not be charmed. For one thing, there are no villains. I like movies that can manage to sustain a story without having to do ""bad guys"" as a major portion of the story. Sam does a superb Buster Keaton imitation. Joon is enchanted; so is Benny. He starts thinking Sam should make a career out of his comedy. His friend is a booking agent, and is willing to have a look at Sam' routine. The bookings, if successful, would take him on tour around the country.

But Joon doesn't want him to leave, and apparently Sam doesn't want to go. They decide they have to tell Benny they are in love. He freaks out, but this issue is resolved in a unique way. They find that love matters, whoever you are. And eventually, so does Benny.",1336953600,,1091,4.396039603960396

874426,5,6304411448,"My college-age daughter suggested that we watch this film.  I'd heard of it, but for some reason was never enticed by it.  Nevertheless we plugged it in and gave it a look.  I have to admit that I was completely engaged all the way through!

Mary Stewart Masterson plays a mentally challenged yet artistically talented woman who lives with her brother who runs a mechanic shop.  He plays poker with three buddies and instead of money they use other odds and ends to ante up and to bid.  One day one of the poker buddies has a relation show up to stay with him (enter Johnny Depp).  He is a classic film fanatic, and has his own unique way of looking and and navigating the world by using silent film legends as his template for living.

One thing leads to another, and through a strange twist of events Depp ends up staying with Joon and her brother.

If you are at all like me, you will be pulled into the story as you wonder what in the world is going to happen next.

The character development is good, Masterson does a fine job portraying her character, and Depp, oh man!  he does an incredible job with the physical humor so common in early films, which in many cases grew out of Vaudeville.

This was an enjoyable experience through and through, and our movie-watching company the night we watched it all agreed.  That crew included myself, my wife, her mother, my college-aged daughter and her roommate, my 12-year old daughter, and 14-year old niece.  It was a success!

874428,5,6304411448,"I kept catching the end of this movie on cable, so ordered it and am quite delighted.  Characterizing this movie as a romantic comedy completely misses the mark, as it mixes several genres, its love story and comedic moments nowhere near the formulas implied by the rom-com label.

First, after knowing about this movie for years, I am quite surprised that the ""Benny and Joon"" of the title are NOT Depp and Masterson as the central love story, but Aidan Quinn and Masterson as brother and sister.  The supporting cast is suprisingly packed with known talent - Julianne Moore, Oliver Platt, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi, even William H, Macy and an unbilled cameo from Winona Ryder (who apparently was Depp's girlfriend at the time and originally approached for Joon).

So why is this a story about Benny and Joon, not Sam and Joon?  As the script would have it, the much older brother Benjamin (""Benny"") and his younger sister Juniper (""Joon"") lost both parents in a car accident, and Benny raises Joon into adulthood.  This trauma seems insufficient to explain Joon's many symptoms, which include pyromania (setting fires), sudden rages, intolerance for loud sounds, talking to herself - a cornucopia of mental disturbances which socially isolate Joon and require regular medication and visits to a psychiatrist.  Not a typical heroine for a rom-com (contrast with the single symptom of the Sandler/Barrymore vehicle, ""50 First Dates"").

Into this mix step Julianne Moore as Ruthie, a love interest for Benny, and Johnny Depp as Sam, a love interest for Joon.  Sam has his own eccentricities - an obsession with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies, illiteracy due to being kicked out of school as a class clown, and a taste for the unusual.

So here come the mix of genres - a serious drama about whether to institutionalize Joon, a comedy featuring the clown-like behavior of Sam, and a little magic realism from its post-modern insistence on being a movie that features a character obsessed with movies (Sam eventually lands a job as a video clerk).

The film is centered not on Sam and Joon, but on Benny and Joon - Benny is angry and trapped but concerned for his sister, Joon is scared and trapped and trying to grow up.  The magic of the movies - represented by Ruthie (a failed actress) and Sam (the soon-to-be video clerk) - enter their lives and transform them.

I won't give too much away, but this movie stands up to repeated viewings, due to its strong cast, special score, and heart.  There is a comic moment near the very end of the movie - one we've seen in a dozen other movies before - and it is a sign of the movie's heart that we give it to them.  Actors love characters that grow - by the end of the movie, Benny and Joon have grown to become Benjamin and Juniper.

Okay - I'm charmed by this sentimental and magical movie, by the gentle patience and restraint that Johnny Depp's character shows toward Mary Stuart Masterson's difficult character.  In a world that tends to push the marginalized towards insane behavior - see, for example, Debra Winger's character in ""A Dangerous Woman"" - this movie provides a happy ending.  I'm a cynical guy, but, despite its inherent tonal problems from trying to mix so many genres, the escape and fantasy provided by this 1993 oddity have made me a fan.",1303516800,,3315,4.735652173913043
874429,4,6304411448,"In 1993, the romantic comedy ""Benny & Joon"" became a hit for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  The film would showcase the physical comedy of Johnny Depp (fresh from his hit film ""Edward Scissorhands"") and its theme song ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles"" by the Proclaimers.

And while there was a little backstage drama behind-the-scenes as Winona Ryder who just broke up with Depp was supposed to play ""Joon"" and Woody Harrelson was to play the role of ""Benny"". The roles were re-cast and Aidan Quinn would be playing ""Benny"" and Mary Stuart Masterson as ""Joon"".

The film would also feature talent who would eventually become popular stars years later with William H. Macy as Randy, Oliver Platt as Eric and Julianne Moore as Ruthie.

Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (""Burn Notice"", ""Gossip Girl"", ""The Avengers"", ""Chuck"") and a screenplay by Barry Berman (""Waterproof"", ""The Adventures of Pinocchio""), ""Benny & Joon"" would earn $23 million and also earn Johnny Depp a Golden Globe Award nomination.

VIDEO:

""Benny & Joon"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  As part of the catalog titles that are being released by MGM/20th Century Fox, I can say that this film does look better than its DVD counterpart but at the same time, does feature dust and speckles from time to time.  For the most part, the film does look very good.  The outdoor scenes are vibrant, the darker outdoor scenes or vignette type scenes have really good inky blacks.

And while colors are vibrant and there is good contrast for this film on Blu-ray, I do believe a lot of these catalog titles which include ""Benny & Joon"" are most likely sourced from an old HD master which was originally used for the DVD release.  But it does look better than its DVD counterpart and that is a plus.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Benny & Joon"" is presented in English 2.0 Surround DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Dolby Surround.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music, including the Proclaimers ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" comes clear through the front channels.  But it's a decent lossless soundtrack that is appropriate for this film.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Benny & Joon"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Jeremiah Chechik.  Chechik talks about the timelessness of the film and not so much of the technical parts of the film.  We learn how the photo of a young Aidan Quinn and Masterson was created, how the film was shot on location and more.
  * Deleted Scenes - (5:12) Featuring two deleted scenes: audition and mutilator.
  * Costume, Make-Up Test and Stunt Reel - (18:45)Featuring various costume and make-up tests with the talent and a commentary track.
  * Music Video - (3:40) Featuring the music video ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" by The Proclaimers.
  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:01) Featuring the original theatrical trailer to ""Benny & Joon"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

It has been nearly 20-years since I have watched ""Benny & Joon"", a romantic comedy that was pretty cool for it's time because it didn't have the typical displays of banality of a romantic comedy.  And the fact that you have a female character who is mentally ill and a young man who probably lived his life watching movies and literally transformed himself to be a hybrid Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin type of actor.  And then you throw in the older brother who has not been able to live his life because he had to care for his younger sister.

""Benny & Joon"" was a film that felt natural and when I first watched it, I found it intriguing, enjoyable and hilarious.  I also credit the film for introducing me Buster Keaton and eventually making me become a silent film fan at a younger age.  But ""Benny & Joon"" is a film that is timeless.  Nearly 20-years-later and sure, the talents are much older but the film doesn't look like it has aged.  The storyline remains fun, relevant, enjoyable and I have not grown tired of it yet.

I felt that the younger Johnny Depp showed an amazing brilliance of what kind of actor he would later become in this film.  The physical comedy and capturing that Keaton/Chaplin-esque style was fantastic and the same can be said with the brother and sister chemistry between Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson.

As for the Blu-ray release, there is nothing new added to this Blu-ray release and as mentioned, I wouldn't be surprised if the HD master was what was prepped for the DVD release.  Fortunately, PQ is good and I didn't find any artifacting and for the most part, if you loved the film on DVD, it's worth upgrading to Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Benny & Joon"" is a romantic comedy that remains honest, fun and enjoyable after all these years.

While I enjoyed the film a lot back then and even now, I do wish the Blu-ray release had a better HD transfer and newer special features but if you really enjoyed ""Benny & Joon"" and have not owned it on DVD or LD prior, then definitely give this Blu-ray release a chance!",1302652800,4,5024,4.75606936416185

874434,4,6304411448,"""Benny and Joon"" is a quirky movie that has heart. When Joon lost a card game she was playing with her brother's friends, before he had arrived, she won an eccentric cousin ""Sam"". Benny is angry with his friend at first, for taking advantage of Joon by putting such stakes in the game, in his absence. But then Benny hesitantly takes this eccentric cousin in, as a housekeeper and caretaker for Joon. This movie portrays the relationship between brother and sister (and how a brother takes care of his special needs sister, even when he feels tired and insecure about his ability to properly take care of her). This movie also portrays the beautiful and strange romance that blooms between two strange people (Joon the girl with some mental problems, and Sam the eccentric man she won). Sam and Joon become a strange and quirky, yet very cute couple, who are in a way soulmates. The ""swinging outside Joon's window"" scene, is memorable and very romantic. This movie also shows the brother Benny learning to live his own life, while taking care of his sister. The only thing that annoyed me is that psychiatrist trying to put Joon in a group home and away from her only family, for no reason.

874609,3,6304411448,"Benny (Aidan Quinn) & Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) are brother and sister. Benny has been taking care of his mentally ill sister for quite some time, since they were orphaned. He keeps his own personal life on hold, since taking care of Joon complicates things so much. Benny has a hard time keeping housekeepers because of Joon's erratic behavior. Joon inevitably takes a disliking to them and drives them away. What was wrong with the latest?

Joon: She was given to fits of semi-precious metaphors.
Benny: The woman is a housekeeper, Joon, not an English professor.

Benny does have a group of buddies that get together and play poker. They make unusual bets, like for salad shooters, or soap on a rope--slightly used. Benny loses, and has to take in Sam (Johnny Depp), who has been staying with his cousin.

Sam is very strange, illiterate, and obsessed with films. He is especially obsessed with silent films, like those of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. He dresses like Buster Keaton, and performs perfect imitations of silent film comedy routines. He also memorizes lines from more recent films, like a slasher film about prom night, Prom Night Mutilator. He recognizes Ruthie (Julianne Moore), the waitress, as an actress from the film. She had gone to Hollywood, but now has given up on her career. A romance blooms between her and Benny, but Benny feels like he can't get involved because of Joon's mental illness. He doesn't notice another romance blooming right under his nose, between Sam and Joon.

Benny & Joon is a cute little movie, but it doesn't really work. Johnny Depp does a surprisingly good job with the silent comedy routines, but that's not enough to carry the film. Perhaps if he was cast in a Buster Keaton biopic, like Robert Downey Jr. playing Charlie Chaplin, it might have worked. Or if the preposterous plot and strange character was juxtaposed with a dull suburban milieu, with tract homes that all look the same except for different shades of pastel, as in Edward Scissorhands, it would have worked. But Jeremiah S. Chechik is no Tim Burton, and his vision wasn't compelling enough for me to want to suspend disbelief.

There were also some missed opportunities. William H. Macy played an agent who was going to audition Sam to put him on some kind of performing circuit. He never auditions, and nothing is made of this. Also, Macy could have provided a rival for Benny, then there could have been a little love triangle, generating a little more tension in their romance. I know that William H. Macy is hardly a threat, but that would have been all the more bitter for Benny if he lost out to him. The one small scene with Macy does have Ruthie making an unlikely appearance, and there is actually a little spark between them. I think that was supposed to be the idea, but it was dropped like a hot potato.

I really like Julianne Moore, but she was never utilized to the fullest. She did the best she could with the material at hand. Given the right film she is a red-headed stick of dynamite.

Depp is a very versatile actor, and he is always interesting, but that can't save the film. He did his own stunts, or comedy routines, like the dancing bread rolls gag from Charles Chaplin's The Gold Rush, or the hat trick from Harold Lloyd's Hey There! You might want to watch this film just to see him, but he is so much better in other vehicles, or at least the other vehicles are so much better...

Mary Stuart Masterson does an adequate job of portraying mental illness, and also shows the creative and quirky side of her personality. She paints, and her own paintings were used in the film. She has all of the good lines:

Joon: Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese.

Joon: Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

Mary Stuart Masterson asked that the song ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" (by the Proclaimers) be used in this film. There is a video of it tacked onto the end. I like those crazy Scottish twins, and their earnest hit single. I like MSM too, but that's not enough to save this film from imploding from terminal cuteness.

874669,5,6304411448,This is a wonderful movie.  It arrived within a few days in perfect condition and was packaged with care to the contents.  We are very pleased and would recommend this seller.,1215907200,,175,4.612903225806452
874670,4,6304411448,"You'll never hear me say that `Benny & Joon' is a perfect film, but you will hear me say that it is a good one, one that I personally enjoy very much.  Do I think that it accurately portrays the handicaps of a mental illness?  No, I do not.  But, keeping in perspective that this is a `quote-unquote' family comedy you don't really expect it to portray the mentally ill perfectly.  To me, `Benny & Joon' is less a film about mental handicaps and more a film about family relationships; and in that respect it works just fine.

The film tells the story of Benny and Joon, brother and sister, who live together.  Their parents are deceased (or so I would gather) and so they have each other, and that's about it.  That is until Sam comes to town.  The strange cousin of one of Benny's poker buddies, Sam winds up staying in Benny's house when Joon loses a poker hand.  Sam turns out to be the best thing for Joon, and ultimately for Benny as well, for he teaches them both valuable lessons about life, love and relationships.

The basic premise of the film is highly preposterous when you think about it.  There is no way that a man in his right frame of mind would leave his mentally ill sister in the care of a complete stranger (especially one as eccentric as Sam).  It took me a minute to take this film seriously when I first realized that that was where this story was going, but the performances are so heartfelt (I'm tempted to say this is Depp as his very finest) that it elevates the material and allows the audience to connect and care about what they are watching.

Of these performances, Depp is the surefire standout.  As Sam he is endearing, intriguing and all around entertaining.  Depp delivers one of his finest comedic performances to date here, in my opinion surpassing that of his fan favorite `Jack Sparrow'.  As Sam, Depp is genuine and sincere; likable and charming and all around a great comedic hero.  Aidan Quinn is superb as Benny, the overprotective older brother.  His reactions towards Sam and really everything involving his sister is genuine, you can see that.  That is why I say it is better to look at this as a film about sibling relationships because the way he protects his sister is the way that any `good' brother in that sort of `family' situation (diseased parents) would react, having officially taken over as a guardian.  I was a little disappointed with Mary Stuart Masterson's performance at first, but as the movie progressed and I realized that I should not be too concerned with how realistic the mental illness translates I began to appreciate her performance.  The script doesn't flesh out her disorder to any real satisfactory degree and so when she has her little tantrums it can seem out of place and unwarranted since the scene before she was acting more `normal' than her brother.

Just a little note on Julianne Moore - in all seriousness, nothing more than a throwaway role, although her characters cinematic background lay scene to some of Depp's funniest lines.

Regardless of your feelings on its accuracy, there is no denying that `Benny & Joon' has a quirky sense of tenderness that is bound to touch your heart.  As the film draws to a close and Sam tells Benny ""I used to look up to you; but now I can't look at you"" your heart will break, and that is a good sign of how effective Depp is in this role.  Sure, this is not Depp's best film (`Ed Wood' anyone) but it is his finest performance.",1214438400,3,3454,4.523349436392914
874671,5,6304411448,"I would recommend this film to anyone, not just Johnny Depp fans. It is wonderful and he is a true artist. Dealing with the mentally ill is never easy, on film or in real life but it is dealt with here. The difficulty of understanding how people feel and what they need. Mary Stuart Masterson was probably born for this part and this film no doubt, was supposed to make her a big star. Sadly for her, being in a film with Mr. Depp did not help her. He is so much more talented than anyone else, that he dominates the action and makes the rest of the characters look like, 'also featuring' extras. Julianne Moore has the worst lines ever and I did feel for her but Johnny Depp's 'Sam' is so much more interesting, that you hardly pay attention. There are also many actors in smaller roles, who will go on to greater things. Oliver Platt, William H. Macy, Danny Hedaya and Aidan Quinn, as Benny, barely manages, once again over-shadowed by our boy Johnny. Yes, I am an intense Johnny Depp fan but he has made a lot of terrible movies. This one is great. There are a few scenes that parents might not care for their young children to see but the PG rating is just fine. Buy it today!",1211587200,,1180,4.272321428571429

They are obliged to take in the quirky Sam (Johnny Depp), and love blossoms between the two soulful oddballs.

For this movie to work, you have to love these relentlessly eccentric characters, and, unfortunately, I couldn't love them enough.  The horrendous pitfalls that go along with mental illness are shown just enough to provide some complications in the narrative, but the filmmakers clearly had their sights set on a happy ending right from the beginning, and they were going to let nothing get in the way.  There are some egregious lapses in logic that are required to make this story go in the direction the filmmakers want.  For example, there is serious debate about whether Joon would be better off living in a group home (where she would have constant supervision) or in her own apartment (where she would be mostly unsupervised, even though there would be a friend living in the same building).  These choices are opposite ends of a spectrum, not roughly equivalent alternatives that a responsible mental health professional would present to a harried caretaker.

There are pleasures to be found here, mostly notably Johnny Depp's extraordinary performance, but you have to be charmed into forgetting the real world first.",1211068800,13,1439,5.097872340425532

If you are able to watch the special feature about ""lighting"" which sounds boring, watch it anyway. Part way through, Depp is seen rehearsing his Buster Keaton flip and fall, several times in a row.

As Sam, a strange, sweet, quirky man with a mild form of mental handicap, Depp performs a Buster Keaton routine with stunning grace as he entertains a crowd in the park.  This routine alone makes the film worth watching.

But add to this sight gags (for example, Depp mashing potatoes with a racket or steaming a grilled cheese sandwich with an iron) that cause giggles and moments of sweetness that touch your heart without being cloying. . . and you've got a movie that is truly entertaining.

874817,4,6304411448,"""Benny and Joon"" is a great film for fans of romantic comedy looking for something different. This movie is different. Very different.

Benny is a car mechanic who has been looking after his mentally ill sister Joon since their parents died. Benny has tried hiring housekeepers to look after Joon, but they all quit in frustration. Benny cannot bring himself to start a relationship, for fear of how Joon will take it, though the viewer gets the impression that he may be using his sister as a crutch to avoid a relationship. Anyway, during a high-stakes poker game between Joon and some of Benny's friends, she loses, with the stakes being that the eccentric Sam must live with them. As it turns out, Sam, with Keaton-esque antics and eccentric nature, is just the housekeeper that Joon has been looking for, and they fall in love.

Don't be expecting a realistic solution to mental illness, because it's not here. Furthermore, I thought that the resolution of the rifts between Benny and his love interest and Sam & Joon was a little too easy.

The viewer roars with laughter and roots for the two main characters splendidly played by the adept Johnny Depp and his movie paramour Mary Stuart Masterson (""Joon"").

Masterson, a brilliant artist - we see her lavishly lay the paint upon the canvas - has a severe problem: she hears voices in her head. She says, with keen insight, to her loving caretaker brother (""Benny""), played by Aiden Quinn, ""You need me to be mentally ill.""

Indeed he does, using it as an excuse to put his own life on hold. In a plot twist, Johnny Depp comes to live with brother and sister. Depp is delightfully different in his own way. Although he can't write, he is a master comic, as hilarious as Chaplin or Buster Keaton. I found myself roaring at his ridiculous antics, including making grilled cheese sandwiches with a hot iron. Hmmmm, never thought of that.

Not surprisingly, Johnny Depp and Joon, each with their delicious quirksome natures, fall in love: spoken-for in Spokane.

Just because Masterson is ill, however, doesn't mean Johnny will forsake her. Memorable scenes include Masterson and Depp taking off on a Greyhound bus to start a new life. Stress, however, causes Masterson's voices to assault her - she holds her head in her hands in terror - and ends up in a police ambulance which takes her to a stark mental hospital.

Unthwarted, Depp figures out how to secretly visit her in one of the most hilarious moments in film history. And, yes, the caretaker brother decides that love indeed does conquer all, and has his moment of truth by a railroad train, the motif that runs throughout the film, which is also rich with great songs.

Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc.  These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood.

(I was particularly taken with Dan Hedaya's performance; he impressed me in The First Wives' Club and does the same here.) Depp's seemingly effortless portrayal of a physically demanding role provides jaw-dropping amazement and humor on a grand scale. His performance here just ratchets up my admiration for his mastery of his craft. (The DVD extras didn't spend nearly enough time on how much training he went through, but what -was- shown was astounding. An excellent illustration of what hard work goes into portraying a role.) Great music, comedy, a believable and excellently portrayed story of comedy, romance, and conflict between self-sacrifice for family duties and responsiblities vs. letting go. This is a heart-warming film that will have you humming the music and leave you with the feeling that difficult situations can be resolved with the best possible outcomes for everyone involved--given some imagination, trust, and love.",1162080000,,1450,5.227467811158799

874948,5,6304411448,"This is a story about stagnant sibling relationships. Benny (a mechanic) has structured his entire life around 'protecting' his mentally ill sister, Joon. Both are dissatisfied: she in particular has withdrawn from society and broader human interaction, and has an underdeveloped ability to care for herself. The ensuing frustration manifests itself in pyromania.

His need for control and her isolation are tearing their relationship apart, despite the very real and visible love they have for each other. Sam is a much-needed catalyst for change. I suspect that his appeal for Joon, who is immediately drawn to him, lies in the fact that he makes absolutely no assumptions about her on the basis of her condition.

It has been said that this movie is arguing that love conquers all, but I disagree. Romantic love is presented as a mechanism of change and renewal: but the real story lies in a brother's struggle to overcome his own need to protect his sister from society, and in his blindness when it comes to her own requirements as an adult woman. The viewers and Sam himself are made to confront the very real facts of Joon's illness when their attempt to abscond results in a highly traumatic episode.

Essentially, the movie is a humorous and emotional one. While not the most polished movie you'll ever see, 'Benny and Joon' comes across as very sincere, and it isn't afraid to tackle the tough issues. Johnny Depp is as lovely as always, and the film contains moments of incredible wit, warmth, and a quirky kind of humor in its portrait a mentally ill young woman who has absolutely normal needs when it comes to love, sex, and independence.

875008,1,6304411448,"""Benny and Joon"" is an unworkable mix of realism and anti-realistic romanticism. Joon is not ""quirky"", she is dangerously and violently mentally ill. Her condition is so severe that she has burned through all the available certified and experienced caretakers. To try to make her character bearable, the writers trot out one of the oldest, tritest cliches: with great mental illness comes great artistic talent. With this woman's output, her brother should have hooked her up with a gallery; they'd be financially set for life and the artsy set could buzz about this tortured artist (a concept I thought went out of vogue in the 30s).

Benny has completely sacrificed his life to try to care for his sister, with no apparent progress for either of them. The writers here reveal that they know nothing about this sort of situation, because he would not be able to hold down any sort of job that involves leaving Joon alone for even 5 minutes. The unthinking romanticism is applied to his character too, because he never once shows an iota of resentment for the loss of his life.

Sam, a sort of proto-Willy Wonka by Johnny Depp, appears to be either developmentally disabled, borderline autistic, or severely depressed as a result of the dysfunctional family we hear about as the character is introduced. Naturally, in the unnatural world of Hollywood, he is The Savior.

After the first half of the movie depicts the tragedies of the main characters, it suddenly realizes that it needs to get out of the dark corner it has painted itself into. Once Sam and Joon declare their love for each other, nothing that happens makes the slightest sense either in the real world or in the limited universe of the movie. Apparently all that a dangerously violent person needs to do is say, ""I want my own apartment"" and locked mental wards will be thrown open to her and she will become able to function on her own.

The only ways I can see to make this a ""feel-good"" movie would be to either a) switch off your brain before it starts and wallow in the nonsense; b) ignore the nonsense and wallow in the tragedy that has been depicted; or c) after it's over, get down on your knees and give profuse thanks that you never had to live in any of those situations. Since (c) isn't available to a lot of people, and (a) and (b) are not the least attractive, I would recommend avoiding ""Benny and Joon"" like the plague. ""Comedy""? Not anywhere near one.",1127520000,12,2435,4.642691415313225

Johnny Depp does a blow-out job of Buster Keaton style comedy in this movie playing Sam, a cousin of a friend who comes to live with Benny and Joon.  He is funny, sensitive, serious, and courageous.  Mary Stuart Masterson does a fabulous job of playing Joon.  Mr. Quinn does a great job of playing the big brother.

My son, who is 11, watched this with us and he laughed so hard at Sam's antics that he couldn't catch his breath.  He giggled throughout the entire movie. There is a love scene which in my opinion is tastefully done.  There is some language and ludicrous gambling.

So too is one left with the feeling that everyone involved in this film is trying so damned hard to make sure that every single viewer knows that the characters are a little off-kilter (but still have the same feelings & passions as ""normal"" folks), that they don't notice that we all got that point pretty early on.  After a certain point, one feels like one is being beaten over the head with the film's rather ham-fisted quirkiness.  It doesn't make for a bad film, but it becomes a ""too much of a good thing"" situation.  I felt more manipulated than anything else.",1126051200,3,800,4.342281879194631
875060,5,6304411448,"I've been a fan of Mary Stuart Masterson ever since I saw Some Kind of Wonderful, and Johnny Depp plays the kind of quirky characters I usually like, but something had kept me away from Benny & Joon all this time.  Partly, it was the fact that I caught a few minutes of the movie on TV and saw Depp doing a whole vaudeville routine that smacked a little too much of mimes - like every sane person in the world, I detest mimes.  At last, though, I have seen the film and I can declare it a wonderful motion picture - quirky, most certainly, but good and exceedingly human.  It does stretch the theme of love conquers all just a bit, but who cares?

Mary Stuart Masterson plays Joon, a young woman with a mental illness that is never clearly delineated - she's been known to start little fires, she sometimes hears voices in her head, and there is a somewhat childlike character to her nature.  Aidan Quinn plays her brother Benny, a truly good guy who puts his sister's needs ahead of his own - even if it means turning down dinner with a hot chick.  The siblings are approaching a crossroads, though - Joon has just run off another housekeeper, Benny can't find anyone to stay with her during the day, and all the while Joon's doctor is urging Benny to put her in a group home.  Then Sam (Johnny Depp) arrives, after Joon wins him in a poker game - he's one of Benny's buddy's cousins, and he's driving the guy crazy.  Benny takes him home temporarily, and things soon begin to change around the house.

Sam is even weirder than Joon (he makes grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron, for example), so naturally the two hit it off quite well.  He has his own problems, but his quirky ways and Buster Keaton-inspired antics quickly win over Benny and most especially Joon.  Benny even starts seeing a local girl named Ruthie (Julianne Moore), whom Sam immediately recognized as a B-movie actress from a few years past.  Then, of course, romantic love rears its ugly head, and things go south in a hurry for everyone concerned, pushing Joon into a serious episode that shows Sam just how sick she really is.

Aidan Quinn is quite good in his role of Benny (and Julianne Moore is a nice bonus for the film), but Depp and Masterson clearly carry the story with their characters' quirky antics and heart-warming commitment to one another.  As I alluded to, I'm not a fan of the whole Buster Keaton comedy shtick, but Depp proves a master at it, and he and Masterson have a real chemistry between them.  There's high drama alongside a fair amount of subdued comedy, but Benny & Joon is an unashamedly feel-good movie, quite predictable yet charming and touching - and blessed with an extremely talented cast.",1124582400,3,2701,4.506147540983607

Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother.  Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality.  Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp.  The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own.

875117,5,6304411448,"""Benny & Joon"" ranks high on my list of favorite movies. The storyline is fairly unpretentious: Juniper ""Joon"" Pearl (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a slightly unbalanced young woman living with her overprotective brother Benny (Aidan Quinn). The two have been on their own since their parents were killed in a car accident years before. Joon requires constant supervision, as she has a tendency to light things on fire, but her sometimes volatile moods drive away one housekeeper after another. Juggling his life between work and looking after his sister, Benny has little time of his own. At last he must face a difficult choice - should he continue trying to find a housekeeper who can deal with Joon's eccentricities, or should he consider placing her in a group home, where perhaps others will do a better job of caring for her than he can?

Unable to find someone to look after Joon one night, Benny allows her to accompany him to his weekly poker game. And when Joon loses a hand, Benny suddenly finds himself saddled with an unexpected and not altogether welcome houseguest - Sam (Johnny Depp), the strange cousin one of Benny's friends can't wait to get rid of. Little do they realize how drastically this odd newcomer will affect their lives. Sam's quirky ways, particularly his unconventional method of making grilled cheese sandwiches, intrigue Joon as nothing ever has before. And having Sam around to look after Joon frees Benny up to pursue a romantic interest of his own with Ruthie (Julianne Moore), the pretty waitress at the corner restaurant. But as Joon's bond with Sam grows stronger, Benny finds himself torn at the idea that he may no longer be the central figure in his little sister's life.

It's a fun, cute, slightly off-beat romantic comedy, but it isn't all fluff. Unlike many others in the genre, this movie has some substance underneath. The emotions of the characters are genuine, and the brother / sister relationship between Benny and Joon is stressed just as much as the romantic one between Joon and Sam. Though the film contains quite an assortment of oddball characters, it manages to remain rooted in reality and stresses the important things in life. For all the funny, up-beat scenes, like Sam's hilarious physical comedy routines in the park, there are also some serious sequences. The scene on the bus where Sam gets his first real dose of the gravity of Joon's mental illness is probably the heaviest in the film.

We are never told exactly what is wrong with Joon. Seeing the movie for the first time, after hearing the terms ""unbalanced"" and ""mentally ill"" used to describe her, I had expected her illness to be more serious and overpowering than it actually appears to be. She's eccentric and moody, to be sure, but for most of the movie she seems to be quite sensible and sane, sometimes even more so than the other characters. However, she does sometimes hear voices, as we see in the aforementioned bus scene. My personal guess would be that Joon is mildly schizophrenic, and perhaps also somewhat manic depressive, to explain the volatile mood swings. But the important thing is that she does not see herself as ""odd"" or sick. It is the rest of the world, and Benny in particular, that must realize that perhaps Joon is capable of living a more normal, independent life than she has been allowed to so far.

The entire film is very well acted. I cannot think of a single cast member whose performance was not up to par. The stars of the show, of course, are Mary Stuart Masterson as Joon and the incomparable Johnny Depp as Sam. Masterson captures the nuances of Joon's character to perfection. One has no difficulty in believing her complex character to be genuine. And despite her oddities, she remains loveable throughout. Sam is just the kind of quirky character fans of Depp would expect him to play, and he carries it off beautifully as usual, here drawing heavily on the influences of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. His character is slightly more difficult to envision as an actual flesh-and-blood person than Joon's, but in the context of the movie it works. Aidan Quinn and Julianne Moore also turn in great performances, and smaller parts are contributed by Oliver Platt, C.C.H. Pounder, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi, William H. Macy, and Liane Alexandra Curtis.

This is a film I imagine almost anyone could enjoy. It doesn't adhere rigidly to the typical romantic comedy formula, it's believable despite the occasionally far-fetched elements in its plot, and it is genuinely funny and moving by turns. It's also suitable for viewers of just about any age. Again unlike so many modern romantic movies, it does not depend on sex scenes to establish romance. In fact, the physical aspect of Sam and Joon's relationship is limited to just one fairly tame kiss. There's nothing here that parents need be concerned about having their little ones watch. The movie isn't overly long, either, clocking in at only 98 minutes.

The DVD special features are not overly impressive, though there is some worthwhile material. There are two deleted scenes. One is a sequence where Benny, impresed by Sam's physical comedy abilities, has arranged an audition for him with an agent. Unfortunately, there is no option to turn off the director commentary which is placed over the scene, so one can't actually hear the dialogue, which I would have liked. The other sequence is simply a full-size version of the horror movie scene that Benny, Joon, Sam, and Ruthie watch one night. Other special features include an audio commentary, a long series of costume and make-up tests, a stunt reel, the theatrical trailer, and a music video for the theme song ""I'm Gonna Be"" (a.k.a. ""500 Miles"") by The Proclaimers. In summary, this is a terrific, fun, feel-good movie with a decent DVD. Definitely worth adding to your collection.",1093996800,25,5860,4.8667334669338675

It's a special treat to watch Sam, Johnny Depp's quirky, sweet and child-like character, who makes grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron and entertains at a park with his impressive Buster Keaton-like routines. He looks and acts like someone who walked in from another era, maybe even another planet. Watch Depp's facial expressions -- intense and hilarious!
There are heavy moments, such as the bus scene: When the romance between Sam and Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) is misunderstood, forcing the pair to run away, Sam comes face to face with the reality of mental illness as Joon becomes severely agitated with the voices in her head. But he never gives up on love, finding a way to get to Joon at the mental hospital by dangling acrobatically just outside her room from a window washer's perch (my favorite scene). And yes, there's a happy ending.
I watched this movie with my husband and our children (ages 10 and 12). If you plan to watch Benny & Joon with kids, be aware that bad words are used a couple of times, and there's a romantic scene between Sam and Joon that's slightly steamy but not distasteful. Overall, though, the touching story, dialogue, and humor make this a fine movie to watch with kids over 9 years of age (younger kids would probably find it boring).

Joon suffers from mental illness, though throughout the movie there are scenes where she is profoundly sane.
Perhaps the most moving and surprising performance is Johnny Depp, whose dyslexic and extremely talented Sam brings light to Benny and Joon's sad life.  Depp is amazing as he performs his Charlie Chaplinesque slapstick, eyes twinkling.  But what makes his character even more enduring is that he loves Joon no matter how sick she may be.  He wants her to get better and be free from the watchful eye of her over-protective brother.

875176,4,6304411448,"Benny and Joon (Jeremiah Chechik, 1993)
Benny and Joon is, quite simply, an anomaly. Chechik's directorial efforts, both before (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Nuff said.) and after (The Avengers. The American remake of Diabolique. Nuff said.) have been worth of nothing but the cutting-room floor. Aidan Quinn (Songcatcher, Plainsong, many other movies with ""song"" in the title) was in the midst of a decade-long career slump, and Mary Stuart Masterson (Fried Green Tomatoes) was at the very end of her Hollywood viability. So why is it, exactly, Benny and Joon works?
Work it does, and very well. The main reason is a couple of extremely risky casting decisions. Johnny Depp was still a cult figure (and he plays a role that fits in very well with his early nineties persona), and Julianne Moore was still ""that woman who used to be on a soap opera."" Minor roles were filled with rising stars like Oliver Platt (Lake Placid), CCH Pounder (ER), and William H. Macy (Pleasantville), all of whom were still in the character-actor stage at the time. In fact, aside from Masterson, the only really recognizable face in the film is Dan Hedaya, one of Benny's poker buddies. The casting folks took risks, and those risks panned out.
Benny (Quinn) and Joon (Masterson), a brother and sister, have been living on their own since the deaths of their parents twelve years previous. Benny owns an auto body shop; Joon is a professional nutcase. Benny is involved in a weekly poker game with, to say the least, the most interesting stakes of any filmed card game in history. One week, while Benny and Eric (Platt) are outside talking, Joon sits in for him. One of the things she wins in the pot: Sam (Depp). What is wrong with Sam is never fully explained, though severe dyslexia plays a part in it (it wouldn't be out of line to suggest that perhaps Sam is mildly autistic). Sam is obsessed with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and pretty much every move he makes in the film is modeled on one or the other of them. To say any more in a review would spoil the plot.
The script is perfect (odd that scriptwriter Barry Berman has only managed to produce two other scripts deemed filmable by Hollywood, both were disasters), the acting fantastic. How, I don't know. But Depp turns in a solid performance, as does most everyone else (Julianne Moore didn't really have enough of a part to work with). Masterson shines.
Definitely worth watching. *** ",1070236800,3,2446,4.768867924528302
875177,5,6304411448,"A  mechanic, Benny(Aiden Quinn) who has a mentally disabled sister, Joon(Mary Stuart Masterson) is a fed up with her unpredictable behavior, she's always causing trouble and making the house-sitters quit, he's been taking care of her needs so long, he's forgotten his own needs and loss touch with the world a little. Finally when Sam(Johnny Depp) is put in the pot at a poker game, and Joon loses, he has to keep him over for his friend at his house for the indefinitely. Sam is an eccentric guy who is a crazy clownish man who cannot read or write well, and seems completely incapable of living in reality.

 Somehow, while fairly unrealistic, this premise works, it's script is consistently funny and while the premise itself seems unrealistic, the characters are always rooted in reality, and each actors performance roots the characters firmly in the real world.  The choices the characters make seem real given their circumstances, and nobody in the script has the moral high ground the entire film, it seems to shift and change constantly.

  Mary Stuart Masterson gives a truly Oscar worthy performance, it is a role that so easily could have been overdone, but having seen what mental illness does to people, the way she acts and reacts is 100% real, he performance is not histrionic, it is very much rooted in reality, if it was not, this would just be another mediocre early 1990's effort on mental illness.  Aiden Quinn and Julianne Moore are the most normal characters in the movie, but each of them have to make considerably difficult choices, and their characters are handled very admirably.  Watching Johnny Depp here is astounding, he says more with his eyes than with his words in most shots, he doesn't need to speak at all, and his character is fairly quiet compared to everyone else, but when he does open his mouth to speak the dialogue is often either hilarious or heartbreaking.  He also should have been nominated for an Oscar for this role, it has not diminished at allover time,  the physical comedy which is modeled after Buster Keaton is just as hilarious and entertaining as it was 20 plus years ago (it is now 2016).

Some people may complain about what big explanation as to why Joon is the way she is, there are hints here and there, but there is no easy answer, nor does it spell out what he illness is, which in to turn makes this film applicable and relateable to anyone with a mental illness.

875212,5,6304411448,"This is a quirky romantic comedy about two people who, deemed as misfits by society, fall in love with each other. Featuring outstanding performances by the entire cast, this is a film that lets the viewer know that there is, indeed, someone for everyone.
 When eccentric Sam (Johnny Depp) enters the lives of a brother and sister, Benny (Aidan Quinn) and Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), he changes their lives forever. Benny, it seems, is always worried about his sister who seems to be autistic. He treats her like a baby, making sure that she is never left alone. Highly intelligent, creative, and articulate, Joon, however, chafes a bit under the  thumb of her protective older brother, but she  does have some issues, as  there are certain things that act as triggers for some odd behavior on her part.
When Sam begins living with Benny and Joon, acting as a housekeeper-babysitter, Sam treats Joon like a regular person, and before you know it they are falling in love, each accepting the quirks of the other with complete equanimity. Meanwhile, Benny is attracted to Ruthie (Julianne Moore), who owns the local diner. The only thing is that he cannot seem to concentrate on romance, as he is so worried about what the future holds for his sister.
There are some twists and turns in the romances between Sam and Joon, as well as in that of Benny and Ruthie. There are some very funny moments, as well as those filled with genuine pathos. There is also a certain amount of physical comedy reminiscent of that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. In the hands of the adept Johnny Depp, it works.

875216,5,6304411448,"In the last ten years box offices have seen so many bad romantic comedies that it's hard to believe directors even try anymore. Even the ones that aren't awful aren't necessarily good, for example most of Meg Ryan and Jennifer Lopez's movies don't qualify as either. However, after I saw Angelina Jolie and Edward Burns in the horrific chick-flick `Life or Something Like It' I had to ask myself: ""Has there ever been a good romantic comedy? Why do people still see these things? Isn't it obvious that the genre of romantic-comedy is a completely lost cause?"" Then I saw this movie. If `Benny and Joon' is nothing else, it is solid proof that there is such a thing as a good romantic comedy.
Aidan Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson play dysfunctional siblings, Benny and Joon Pearl. Benny is a car mechanic whose dull life revolves around taking care of his mentally unstable sister, Joon. The climax of Benny's week takes during poker night with his friends. On one arbitrary night, Benny takes Joon with him, Joon ends up playing and looses. Benny and his friends always play for keeps, and as a result of Joon's loss is Benny has to take his friend's illiterate cousin, Sam (Johnny Depp), home with him.
Sam is polite and curious and Benny decides to keep him around when he inadvertently cleans the whole house during his first day with the Pearls.  As time goes on, Sam's presence forces Benny and Joon to recognize long unrealized problems in their relationship, while simultaneously allowing Joon to indulge a side of herself she never knew existed.
`Benny and Joon' strikes a perfect balance between quirky and adorable, and is rather Romeo-and-Juliet-like in its ability to make an audience care about what happens to a pair of very star-crossed lovers. The astonishingly real characters and the fact that they're played by exquisitely well cast actors is probably this movies best asset in a technical sense. Aside from that I think this movie's best point, is that it is absolutely unrivaled as the best romantic comedy I've ever seen in my life.",1061337600,8,2055,4.805084745762712

I would call this movie a decent drama, but it is elevated immeasurably beyond that status by the magical drama of Johnny Depp's Chaplan-like antics.  This is directed by the same Jeremiah Chechik who gave you National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  This is quite a departure for him, but it is in my opinion an endearing comedy/drama/romance.

It's Johnny Depp at his best. I've had this film recorded from the TV for ages, and typical, my tape ran out, and I missed only the last 15 minutes (and what a disappointment they were!)
Johnny Depp plays the loveable Sam, who's cheese seems to have come off his cracker. His whole character, moves, voice, and his funny comedic moments are a total take-off of Charlie Chaplin & all those actors from the ""good old days"". He is taken in by Benny & Joon. The lovely Aidan Quinn plays Benny, looking after his sister, Joon, played by Mary Stuart Masterson (who I still say was in Little House On The Prarie, but no one believes me!). Joon is ""mentally ill"" or ""sick"" - the film never actually says what's wrong with her. I think she's either autistic or schizophrenic - sorry if that's wrong, or she's not one or the other, but I always get them muddled up! She lives to a routine (that makes me think autistic), but she switches personalities (schizophrenic?). I love watching this little routine, watching her make breakfast, or the way she goes to sleep at night, or the way she paints - she gets more of it on her than she does on the canvas! Enter Benny. Who she instantly falls in love with. The music behind the love scene is brilliant, and well played by Johnny & Mary.
There's a few classic moments in this film - mainly thanks to Johnny Depp. Just wait til you see him do his whole performance in the park, or his little dance with the bread in the restaurant. Or making a toasted cheese sandwich by ironing it, and making mashed potatoes by hitting them with a tennis racket. If that doesn't make you want to see this film, nothing will. And the classic line? ""Raisins are just humiliated grapes"". I love this film. It doesn't show much about the mentally ill, and at the end, there's too many things left in the open. Like what happens to Benny & the woman he fancies, Ruthie (played by Julianne Moore)? We see Joon getting her own apartment, but how is it decorated? Are there paintings everywhere? And does Sam move in with her? All will be discovered in the sequel ... I wish.

Johnny Depp plays Sam and does another excellent job. This is more in line with ""Chocolate"" than ""Edward Scissorhands"" (I liked the former but detest the latter). He is quiet, but entertaining. He is not shown as obsessed with Buster Keaton, but he does bang-up jobs of mimicking him. The scenes in the park are great.
Aidan Quinn is very good as Benny. He holds the role of protective older brother to Joon. Some of his later actions are predictable, but Quinn never falls out of line with his characters.
Mary Stuart Masterson does a good job as Joon (Juniper ""Joon"" Pearl). Only a couple times does she slip out of character. When she is in-character, she is excellent.
The plot is simple. Some people claim that it is unrealistic. For the majority of people, yes it is. However, truth is stranger than fiction and this is a feel-good movie that reminds us of positive things and looking forward to another day.
The lenghth of the movie is good. Only for a couple minutes during the start did I question if it would go too long (the opening train sequence is visually entertaining, but could have been cut short).
The sound is a big factor for me. This movie comes through with a big thumbs-up. The music is clean and upbeat, like a blend of Gershwin and Supertramp. The editing is excellent (except for one case with the car stopping, but the rest is so much better than normal that it probably shouldn't be mentioned). The sound really put this movie in the 5-star league.",1046995200,5,1704,4.464743589743589
875263,4,6304411448,"I am not a fan of many movies post 1966 or so... in fact, this is one of the scant few I can say is good enough to watch more than twice. I saw it at a friend's house last summer twice and I would definitely watch it again. It was nothing very deep or meaningful but it was very fun and the dialogue was just great.
I have a hunch that pretty much all aspects of the story have been covered by other reviewers so I'll just tell about what stood out to me. From the first moment it was good. Johnny Depp's character (his name escapes me - Sam, was it?) peering over the top of a book with Buster Keaton on the cover and he looks just like the picture. He almost never says anything, and when he does he's so solemn about it that you can't help laughing.
Joon takes things pretty seriously too. Her idea of an emergency is running out of super-crunch peanut butter.
Sam does such funny things. Especially the spinning the hubcap and doing the dance with the forks and hot dog buns. He and Joon talk so seriously about the strangest things - how sad raisins are (they're nothing but humiliated grapes, says Joon), and whether grilled cheese should be cooked on the wool or rayon setting. (Sam toasts them with an iron.)
The scene when Sam and Joon are leaving on a bus is about the saddest part. Joon starts having one of her scizophrenic fits and Sam in his slow brain hasn't a clue what to do for her. But of course everything ends up OK.
Overall I found it a very sweet, light movie good for many laughs. I also appreciated that there was really no violence, only one bad word that I can remember, and the love scenes were not too overbearing - you just saw them kissing. I thought the balloon music serenade was too weird to be true - can you really play music with a balloon?
Anyway, for me to say that a recent movie is good is a pretty high recommendation... You should see it - I can't believe you wouldn't like it.",1031011200,4,1920,4.191891891891892

Benny has been taking care of Joon since their parents died in a car crash. However, he has reached a breaking point. Then Joon wins Sam after losing a poker bet. Kind of weird, huh? Anyway, Joon and Sam fall in love and that leads to complications for Benny. Enough plot summary.

This is not a fascinating film on mental illness. Other than the unusual lives of the characters, this movie boils down to a basic romantic comedy, cliches and all. However, the tribute to the classic physical comedy of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin along with the movies' meaningful, memorable music, make this film a cut above the average and worth watching.",1012262400,,823,4.836879432624113
875320,4,6304411448,"Benny and Joon are Brother and sister, and have been inseperable since the death of their parent's. Joon is riddled with a mental disease that jumps and attacks her at the most inopportune times, otherwise it only tampers with her logic. Joon is more intelligent than anyone believes, it's just in her own way. Mary Stuart Masterson (Friend Green Tomatoes) plays Joon to the core, especially in a scene on a bus when her sickness overcomes her. At the same time she is able to show her romantic side, when she meet's the incredible character, Sam.
When Johnny Depp is at the end of his career (God forbid any time soon) he will definately be able look back and see a light. That light is Sam. With a mix of slapstick, and quotes from cheap flick's, Sam makes his way into Joon's heart. I agree with a friend and fellow reviewer of mine that the poker game was not quite delivered right. A sour play of poker, in Joon's hand's, causes her and her brother to win Sam in the pot. (Joon put's a green haired troll doll in the kitty, and her apponent put's in Sam, his cousin.)
Benny is Joon's brother and guardian. Between no love life, and Joon scaring away her sitter's, he has a stressful time keeping sane himself. But with the tragedy comes release when Sam enter's their lives.
What follows the (did-not-handle-with-care) card game is the real flesh of the movie. One of the best modern romances is captured here, and more interesting, it's believable. No moping or sappy stuff found in cheapened love films, but true and heartfelt love that is real and tender.
Even though the screenplay is terrific I personally think that the title is misleading. It's really about Joon and Sam. But, I understand that switching character names in a writer's mind is hard, and it is true that the starting backbone is Joon and Benny. Then again, who cares about the title. There are great film's that have titles that don't relate at all: Magnolia, anyone?
See and enjoy. It truly is one of the best romances. Equally it's one of the best comedy/drama's.",1005523200,,2042,4.597260273972603
875321,3,6304411448,"This movie was filmed in my hometown in Washington state. I got to see part of it being filmed. The diner in the film, where Julianne Moore works, is my brother in law's. So, needless to say, this interesting film hits close to our hearts. In the film, Johnny Depp stars as an eccentric character who goes to live with Benny(Aidan Quinn), and his mentally unstable sister Joon(Mary Stuart Masterson). You see, Benny lost a poker game and had to take Sam(Depp)in. That part is a little hokey. The two eccentric characters of Sam and Joon click and start a secretive relationship. They don't want big brother Benny to find out. There are a few delightful moments of whimsical silliness that makes this movie quite charming. Depp showcases his brilliant talent for physical comedy. His Buster Keaton routine is priceless. His Chaplin shtick in the diner is a classic. By the way, the jukebox in the diner was a prop. It's not ours. Masterson is quite effective as Joon. They are both very believeable. Aidan Quinn is solid as the overprotective brother Benny. A good performance. Dan Hedaya and CCH Pounder also star. The movie was directed by Jeremiah Chechick, who also did ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"". This is a sweet little movie with a sweet little story. Might want to check it out.",1005091200,5,1297,4.794642857142857

875323,5,6304411448,"Almost, but maybe not quite that far to see this beautiful, quirky movie.  It's Johnny Depp's showcase as the soulful Sam with strong support from Mary Stuart Masterson (Joon-short for Juniper) and Aiden Quinn (Benny).  Sam can barely read or write, but is a savant in the cinematic area, so much so, he doesn't just imitate Buster Keaton, he miraculously becomes Keaton.  The photography is stunning, capturing the perfect town, the perfect park and even a perfect hospital.  An added bonus is the sublime soundtrack featuring the Proclaimers ""I'm Gonna Be (5,000 Miles),"" Sam's beguiling song.
Before Sam ambled into their lives, Benny was an over-worked, over-protective brother who gave his entire life to hovering over his disturbed younger sister.  Joon precariously threads her way between ""somewhat strange"" and outright nuts.  She is smothered, but not strong enough to struggle through the cobwebs.  Sam is the catalyst for both of them.  He falls in love with Joon and implacably, but innocently sets her free.  Sam has a certain ferocious clarity in his view of the world that allows Joon to follow.
The hilarious exchange between Benny and Sam is the heart of the movie:
Sam:  How sick is she?
Benny:  Oh she's plenty sick.
Sam:  Oh, because you know, it seems to me that, aside from being a little mentally ill, she's pretty normal.
You will enjoy Benny & Joon on many levels.  It will make you smile and laugh out loud, you will be touched in spite of yourself, and definitely feel better for the experience.",988329600,5,1523,4.879377431906615
875324,4,6304411448,"It's been a while since I've seen this one, but I thought it was so endearing.  The romance between the Charlie Chaplin wanna-be and the vulnerable young woman is very sweet.  They are both undeniably cute, and the whole concept harks back to the innocence that we see so little of in films these days.
The movie is not at all overstated, being more of a lovably quirky film.  Johnny Depp is fantastic.  I recommend this movie to viewers who like their romance with a difference - and that good old-fashioned touch.",974419200,4,515,4.565217391304348
875325,5,6304411448,"Although I do not know anybody specifically like the people in this movie, I was impressed with how humanely the mentally-challenged were treated. The idea that they can (let alone have a right to)find romance is still problematic  in many sectors of society.

Both Joon (Mary Stuart Mastersion)  and Sam (Johnny Depp) are slightly atypical, they are very talented people----in their own way. Their main problems stem from a society that does not  understand their artistic and free-spirited tendencies. Joon's patronizing doctor either wants to hospitalize her or put her into a group home. The housekeepers recommended by this psychiatrist did not work because they treated her as a task/object to perform, instead of an independent person.

Benny (Aidian  Quinn) really tries to be a good brother, but he wants to protect Joon. He does not realize that she is much more capable of functioning than he  presumes her to be.  He has her best interests at heart, she is his  last family member and feels obligated to protect her. Coincidentally, he has a friend at the same mental hospital where Joon's doctor has admitting privileges, who says he does not want to be a housekeeper. Benny has grown up with the medical perspective of disability.

Only later does he figure out that this approach is making him 'sick'. He has no life of his own and is always stressed. He also has no girlfriend to share things with.
.
 This behavior is not  atypical among parents and family with another member who has any kind of  disability. It is both inspiring and courageous for a major motion  picture to show a transformation of the characters from supporting medical to independent living that independent living perspectives.

Sam and Joon end up the  perfect couple, and Benny starts to relax and finally also get a life of his own. Treating Joon as a person vs. a medical case is healthy for the entire family.

The movie is charming. It capitalizes with the entertainment  world's fascination with the Pacific Northwest and the grunge scene of the early 1990's, showing a lot of great scenery and music Unlike so many movies today, the romance and intimacy scenes  are both romantic, obvious and tasteful.

I did not intially appreciate how revolutionary it was to show a person with a disability having sexual activity.--but it does show this, as well as the all-to-real fall out when Benny discovers what Joon and Sam did, because he did not want to come to grips with her being an adult woman who would be interested in sexual relations.",963878400,10,2535,4.851162790697674

Benny & Joon is a movie about a car mechanic who lives with his mentally ill sister. Well, she's not THAT ill - but ill enough that Benny has to take care of her, and this even at the  cost of not developing a life on his own.
One day, a weirdo - played  brilliantly by annoyingly good-looking Johnny Depp - comes to town. This is  the start of changes in the life of Joon. And of Benny.
This unusual  movie has all a good movie needs. It is an interesting, moving and also  entertaining story, told in a heartfelt way without being too sentimental.  And fortunately it lacks the major drawbacks of Hollywood movie clich&eacute;s!",961200000,3,656,4.336065573770492

Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at  times.  I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it.""  Not a terrible film,  but not that great either.

This is not true. This story  is one of the best to illustrate that. Joon is a mentally  ""imbalanced"" woman who is taken care of by her brother, Benny.  One day a new person comes into their lives, an odd young man named Sam  (Johnny Depp; in one of his few comedy roles) who, by falling in love  mutually with Joon, poses both a threat and a challenge to Benny, who up  til then has had total control of his sister. He does not realize that Sam  is anything more than a housekeeper until the unthinkable (to him) happens  and he finds that Sam and Joon have, in falling in love, also had sex. He  begins to lose control. I could tell more, but then there would be no  incentive for you to see it. But I will say this: You won't be dissapoited  if you see this movie, and if you watch it with an open frame of mind.  Enjoy.",954979200,8,1004,4.066326530612245
