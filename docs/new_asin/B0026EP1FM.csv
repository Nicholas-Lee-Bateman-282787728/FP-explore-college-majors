8352516,3,B0026EP1FM,"My DVDs are debatable in quality. I've watched Mas Bonita Que Ninguna and found nearly every scene interrupted by ""digital noise."" The screen freezes and you miss audio too. The complete section for the song ""Mi Corazon"" could not be seen.
I've watched Buenos Dias, Condesita which I bought the set for. Perfect picture and good sound, overall (with some shrill tinniness near the beginning).",1435104000,,392,5.046153846153846
8352517,5,B0026EP1FM,I love this set! Some of the movies I never saw them before and I am very pleased that I have seen them now. I always loved Rocio Durcal's movies and this set is great. I would like to find more of her movies.,1301961600,6,209,3.772727272727273
8352518,5,B0026EP1FM,"Se necesitan mas peliculas de Rocio, y esta de seis me parece fenomenal
lo unico malo que peliculas son y es bueno saber que es lo que compra
una, a lo mejor ya tengo dos o tres de ellas, pero de que es lo mejor
definitivamente, vivia ROCIO y que descanse en paz que lo merece.",1290384000,6,277,3.9642857142857144
