8526963,5,6302796814,"This video was excellent from the start.  The earliest submarines to be filmed were shown in this video, as well as how interest in the submarine's capabilities increased their development.  The video depicted the use of U-boats in WWI and WW2 and briefly mentioned the use of U.S. submarines in the Pacific.  As a former navy nuclear technician stationed on a submarine, I was most fascinated by watching the beginning of the nuclear submarine.  The world's first nuclear prototype, where I trained, was included in the video.  As the Soviet Union made advances in space, fear of nuclear war intensified.  This shock prompted the design and construction of the first fleet ballistic missle submarine, as so stated in the film.  This video is, in my opinion, an excellent to my collection.",978825600,4,789,4.977099236641221
