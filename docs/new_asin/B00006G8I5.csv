7968434,4,B00006G8I5,This is actually a really good print of this film. And it's the full length version too. Not the 73 minute VHS version.  This is the retro media version and its uncut. The film itself is pretty decent for being a vampire flick from 1969.,1525910400,,237,4.266666666666667
7968435,2,B00006G8I5,"Fangs of the Living Dead, 1969 film

It begins in a European city. A doctor gets a telephone call from his fiance, a beautiful model. She has inherited a castle and title in Waldreck. It does not have the comforts of Rome.

At night Sylvia gets a visitor, who tells her about her uncle and mother Sonia. Blinka tells her to sleep, her uncle arrives! Sylvia is surprised to see her uncle with Blinka. Her uncle tells her how her mother died: at the hands of angry villagers as a witch! And her father is not dead.

She breaks her engagement with Piero in a letter. He goes to try to meet her. Has she turned into a snob? In the village the bar maid has developed anemia. Her window will be closed and garlic placed by it. Does someone want to hurt Berta? Is the belief in vampires a form of collective psychosis? Doctor Piero is called because of Bertas grave illness.

Piero finds her but is told to go away. Pieros friend meets a vampire! Piero is captured and chained. The uncle explains Bertas condition. Will Sylvia bite Piero or free him? Berta fights with Malinka! Piero attacks the uncle with a burning torch, who returns to his natural state! The fire burns him up. Sylvia and Piero leave in the morning for Rome. Bertas sister wants to go to Rome  also, but Pieros friend has changed overnight.

You can see the parallels to Bram Stokers famous novel, but it doesnt compare to the Hollywood movies of the past. This story is slow paced but worth watching once in comparison. Most cultures have legends of vampires, the oldest story is found in the Epic of Gilgamesh from the Sumerian civilization of 5,000 years ago. This story symbolizes how the aristocracy exploits the people.",1483056000,,2330,4.485849056603773
7968436,1,B00006G8I5,"Anita Ekberg plays an engaged woman who finds out she has inherited a castle. When she goes to visit her new home she encounters her trying-to-be-scary but actually boring-you-to-death uncle. She is eventually told the truth, something about her family being vampires and she has to break her engagement and stay with them at the castle.

My God was this movie boring. It adds nothing new or original or even interesting to the vampire genre and NOTHING happens. Everyone speaks slowly so they can elongate the movie whose plot is worthy of about 25 minutes of movie. For a supposed horror film, it is not scary, frightening, bloody, gory, exciting, or psychologically twisted. It is absolutely nothing except a job for non-actress Anita Ekberg and her expansive breasts. That's the one part I'm not complaining about.",1219622400,,818,5.014705882352941
7968437,1,B00006G8I5,"In this 1969 film by Amando de Ossorio (Tombs of the Blind Dead) Ekberg plays an Italian fashion model who inherits a creepy Spanish castle, only to learn that her ancestors were vampires.  The sets and costumes are beautiful, but can't compensate for the stiff performances, poor dubbing and slow pacing.
Avoid Retromedia's DVD version.  Even though it purports to be the 88-minute ""Americanized"" version of the film, it's only 74 minutes and appears to be an edited-for-television version.
One and a half stars out of five.",1081036800,7,525,5.022988505747127
7968438,4,B00006G8I5,"Released in 1968 as part of a triple-horror-feature for the drive-in crowd, ""Fangs"" came and went without notice in this country. Supposedly, this is the ""American"" version. Retromedia--whom I admit I have no respect for due to their poor quality offerings--has done an OK job with this Italian-Spanish vampire mish-mash and I rather enjoyed it. 50's sex bomb Anita Ekberg is miscast as Sylvia--a Rome ""bathing suit model""--who is notified she has inherited a castle. On her arrival, it turns out she has inherited it's alleged vampiric/witchcraft legacy as well. The strangely effete and thin ""Uncle"" who has sent for her has other cards up his sleeve. What follows is a campy Euro effort at atmospheric horror replete with beautiful girls, a dungeon tomb, sinister caretaker, Euro-style barmaids at a local inn and , of course, ""vampires"" that may or not be real. It's all very ""PG"" with no gore or nudity but LOTS of cleavage on the girls. There's a typical stiff-as-a-board hero and his comic-relief friend who dash about saying ""We've got to save her!"" and one line I truly loved from a barmaid to the hero/scientist, ""Would you mind having a look at a girl who's not well?""  The dubbing is so-so, the acting the pits (but so bad it's a riot) and the photography is typically European style atmospheric but rather endearingly low-budget. Miss Ekberg is a LITTLE too long-in-the-tooth to be a damsel in distress with an obviously younger leading man, but she is still beautiful and displays, in one outfit, some astounding ""assets"" that are truly eye-bogglers. All in all, not bad if you're in the mood for something like this and especially if you like low-budget ""Euro-shockers"". The color is good with one shady spot in one scene and the soundtrack has what sounds to be the original continental jazz flavored pop score along with the appropriately creepy stuff. I liked it---maybe you will too.",1032825600,24,1902,4.906832298136646
