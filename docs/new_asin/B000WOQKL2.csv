2987825,5,B000WOQKL2,A unique movie that highlights the poor state of India's sports and the apathy experienced by sportswomen. This could be among the best SRK performances and lacks all of the usual overacting that is his trademark.  The movie proves that Bollywood can make highly entertaining movies and can do without the usual song and dance numbers while carrying a valuable social message. This movie rates 5 stars just for being more inventive than all the other dull-as-dishwater films that Bollywood churns out (mostly). The next movie should be about the abysmal Indian cricket team.,1197244800,4,574,5.1063829787234045

2987849,1,B000WOQKL2,"Warning: spoiler.  My opinion, which I don't ask anyone to share, is that this film rehashes classic modern artistic themes: all males are bad, except for one, who battles against other (bad) males.  Shortcomings of females are attributable to a bad male in their lives.  Females beat up males.  Females outplay males in sports.  I am unaware of any historical basis for the story.  I agree, there are many examples in real life of females suffering from injustices done by males, and vice versa.  Injustice is bad.",1364601600,,515,4.850574712643678

Can they play together as a team for India or will they play with the attitude that each thinks themselves the best?  Through insults and disagreements from the girls, then his decision to resign, Kabir Khan uses situations and wisdom in making difficult decisions.  He is tough with the girls because he knows how it feels to lose a World Championship game having come so close to winning, and the degradation and burden of that loss.  No one lets you forget!  So he constantly advocates playing as a team because it is the only way to play for India and win the World Championship.  He succeeds in getting them to the World Championship games after the decision to play against a men's hockey team became the deciding factor.  The men, a professional team, were impressed with their determination to make it through and that helped turn the decision in the girls favour.  Having come this far, will Kabir Khan succeed in coaching his team to play for India and therefore win the World Championship games for their country, especially after the initial  game of 0 goals for India, and 7 goals for Australia?

One of the interesting themes to me from the story was just how fractured India is.  The coach struggles with the team players seeing themselves as state champions. They value their state first and then India.  They don't work well together.  Think of champions from Germany being asked to help champions from France.

The coach helps them to learn to to be a team.

It is a fun story",1348876800,,595,4.453703703703703
2987857,5,B000WOQKL2,"I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan and I loved this film. I loved seeing him play the role of a coach. It was neat to see how he was able to unite the team and help them all be better players. In the final moments of their most critical match, it was especially impactful to see how Shah Rukh Khan helped the goalie succeed. I really enjoyed watching this film.",1335312000,,352,3.971830985915493
2987858,5,B000WOQKL2,"Loved...loved...LOVED this movie!  Even though I like a good bollywood film, I enjoy one with a well thought out plotline, good acting and realistic dialogue even more.  (Although as English is my primary language I am judging the dialogue on subtitles alone.)  There was no romance to speak of and no dance numbers--just a very well done movie.",1330905600,,345,4.913793103448276
2987859,4,B000WOQKL2,"My wife and I love anything that has Shahrukh Khan in it. She still hasn't seen this one yet, because she is not into sports. However, this movie is still good,(even for someone who thinks men are little boys because we watch sports), because the storyline is more about the girls he selects for the team, than the winning, or losing. The players have their flaws, but he deals with them.
In this movie, he doesn't ham it up, with asides to the audience, etc. But, even though it is by and large not a comedy, it still has its moments.
I recommend this movie for its heart, and the girl actors, most of whom I had never seen before.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways, but not cloyingly sweet.
This movie, nor any other I have seen from Bollywood, is as good as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. I have bought many others, hoping for another blast like that one. Still looking.",1330646400,,879,4.365853658536586
2987860,4,B000WOQKL2,"This is a really good movie. We did not recognize SRK in this film at first. We watched it on Netflix, but decided to buy it here for a good price. There is a bit of violence in one scene. There is a scene where an engaged couple wake up in the same bed. No bad language that we could hear. No real religious elements, either. It is one of those Sports movies where the rag-tag team has to learn to work together to succeed.",1326672000,,424,4.0
2987861,5,B000WOQKL2,"Chak De is a great movie to watch.  I watched it with my 7th and 8th grade students and they seemed to really enjoy it.  They really liked the music, too!  I had one student who tried to download it on his I-pod. He liked the Chak De song that much. We had to read the subtitles, but that was okay for them.  It was a good experience.  For 6th grade students, I think the subtitles would be too difficult to read.  I would recommend showing this movie to 7th-12th grade students.  We were studying the Indus Valley (Social Studies), so I thought this movie had a connection to what India is like today.  Very good movie!!!",1301443200,,622,4.256410256410256
2987862,5,B000WOQKL2,"Wow!!!  After watching this on Netflik streaming, I had to order it from Amazon for all the special features.  You can't beat this movie for all the drama that goes on in team sports.  Will highly consider purchasing the Blu-Ray version for $10 more after viewing the standard dvd and giving it to my middle school athlete to watch, for this film captures the true spirit of team sports.  Simply excellent.  Lessons learned are transferable to all other team sports: basketball, soccer, rugby, la cross, water polo, etc.  A movie such as this should help facilitate a coaches job after viewing by the team.",1273363200,,606,4.778846153846154
2987863,5,B000WOQKL2,"India is made up of 28 fiercely unique states that belong to India mostly because they might not fit elsewhere. Coaching hockey is easy compared to getting 16 women from all over India to self sacrifice and play together as a team.

There is some very funny self mocking humor in Chak de India, the best sports movie I have seen.  How many Indians can get out of one van? I'm confused, which one's Didi?  What does ""ho"" mean?  Can a women's field hockey team hold it's own in a fight against men? Can they win a game against men?

Shahrukh Khan, using less-is-more acting, seems to fit the part of the women's field hockey coach perfectly.  The assistant coach does a fine job of prividing a reference point from which to measure the ability of the head coach.  An incredibly dynamic cast of young women was pulled together and they do a wonderful job in their respective roles - including the women who played the opposing teams.  The Indian team is a dirty dozen plus a few, ranging from a big tough Punjabi girl to a little spark plug that won't quit to (Ho, Ho, Ho) Soimoi (her name, not a medical condition) a girl that rode out of the Jharkhand jungle on an elephant to join the Indian National Team.

There is no dancing, but one song is superb and sung really well.

Okay, this film is predictable since you know who is going to win the final game but you do not know how they are going to make it to the final, much less win.  We have watched this film quite a few times yet we still sit on the edge of our seats hoping they make each shot.  Sounds stupid, I know.  Shooting, editing, directing, writing, sets, you name it, are all perfect, mainly because less is really more.",1270771200,,1685,4.328025477707007

2987867,5,B000WOQKL2,"This is a wonderful movie!  It is, to some extent, a typical ""underdog sports team with all sorts of drama wins everything despite the odds"" movie.  But it is better than that.  Girls will love it.",1240185600,,197,4.416666666666667
2987868,3,B000WOQKL2,"This Bollywood epic weighs in at the length of ""Gone With the Wind"" but the story of the ""Mighty Ducks."" Years after facing humiliating defeat on the field, former hockey star Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) returns to the game as coach of the Indian women's national hockey team, striving to shape a ragtag bunch of female athletes into a playing force to be reckoned with. His 16 recruits show up from every corner of India, a testiment to the ethnic diversity of that massive land. For the most part, they represent types rather than characters -- the spoiled rich girl, the tomboy, the shy one, the angry one etc etc. Khan's job is to meld them into a team, for as he observes, it's teamwork, not strength that wins world championships.
What elevates this a little over the usual biopic is the Indian setting. Khan is a Muslim -- he's denounced as a traitor to India after missing a vital shot in a match against Pakistan. But his heart still beats true and strong for the beloved homeland. There is an interesting feminist twist -- the women have to take on the Indian male team to persuade the sexists who run the hockey association to spend the money on them to go to the world championship. In one amusing scene, the women beat up a bunch of boorish men who are harrassing them at a fast-food restaurant.
Just about every scene of this movie is predictable as is the dialogue and the characters. But it still made for a fairly harmless and painless evening's entertainment.",1236988800,2,1476,4.573584905660377
2987869,5,B000WOQKL2,"The other reviews of this movie pretty much cover it. I just want to add that this is a more realistic and thoughtful movie that is more about uniting the regional differences of India into a cohesiveness as a national identity.
I'm not a sports lover yet I found the hockey quite watchable. It isn't so much a sports movie but rather a story about personalities and nation.
SRK is restrained but excellent. He is not really the main focus of the movie though as he steps back and allows the girls centre stage. Given that they are mostly unknowns and not even actors mostly the girls did a great job.
A world match is played out in Melbourne (where I am from) and I must say they made the place look good - made me want to visit it!
While there is background music, this isn't a song and dance Bollywood - no dances and one sporting song.
I benefited in my understanding of India from watching it and it is a movie they can be justly proud of.",1229990400,2,944,4.25
2987870,5,B000WOQKL2,"I don't know how many people have noticed this, but Preity's sexist and obnoxious boyfriend is practically a double of India's current young vice-captain and star, Mahendra Singh Dhoni-- put their portraits together and you can hardly tell the difference, except that Dhoni's hair is more tousled, his pic was taken in the open air. Which is too bad, because Dhoni is one of the nicest guys around-- always encouraging his players, leading by example, and modest almost to a fault in one-on-one interviews. I am proud to call him a fellow Delhi-wallah, too. If more had been shown of the boyfriend's cricketing talents, we might have thought better of him-- but naah, let him fester in his sexist juices-- Preity's heave-ho of her boyfriend at the end of the movie was well and truly deserved. Chak de, Dhoni.",1222473600,,809,4.827338129496403
2987871,5,B000WOQKL2,"What a great film this is -- well-drawn characters, lots of heart, and an ending that is left a little in suspense until the last moment (it could go either way, trust me).  It introduced me to Shah Rukh Khan, and having seen several of his films I have to say he's a really nice actor.  This movie is not the typical Bollywood; no love story on this one.  But a very nice, well-done film that the family can enjoy.  I bought this from a source other than amazon, because it was too expensive and not available on amazon.  Still, if you can add it to your Bollywood collection, or if this is your first try at a Bollywood movie -- do it!  Highly recommended!",1220140800,,658,4.224
2987872,5,B000WOQKL2,"Did you know that, once upon a time, India was a perennial world power in the sport of field hockey? That, from 1928 to 1980, India garnered eight gold medals in the Olympics? So you'd think hockey would have a larger following. Instead, cricket reigns today as India's most popular national pastime, with field hockey skulking somewhere in the back. CHAK DE! INDIA, in its own little way, takes one tiny step to change that.

CHAK DE! INDIA tells the inspiring fictional story of the India women's national hockey team, from the rocky formation of its newest crop of members to its triumphant quest for the World Cup. CHAK DE! INDIA also tells the story of one man's redemption. As the film opens, the Women's Hockey World Cup is three months away, and yet India's team still doesn't have a coach. Not too surprising, as it's a team disparaged by most, even by the Indian hockey's governing body, of which one member scornfully states that Indian women are born to cook and clean. Finally, in steps Kabir Khan, a disgraced former player of the India Men's National Hockey Team who, seven years ago, was accused of throwing a championship game to Pakistan. But now Kabir has come out of seclusion to become the India women's new coach. And he's got something to prove. Hell, the whole team has got something to prove. But, first, Kabir Khan has to turn this combative, mismatched, agenda-steeped bunch into a cohesive unit...

In CHAK DE! INDIA (""Go, India!""or, maybe, ""C'mon, India!""), Indian cinema refreshingly does away with its habitually overwrought melodrama and giddy romances. What we get is a simple story, told with impact and with restraint. It's one of the most entertaining and highest grossing Bollywood films of 2007. And why not? CHAK DE! INDIA is a superb underdog sports movie that'll strike a chord. The training sequences and the hockey matches are played out convincingly enough (at least, I didn't feel that the girls were faking it). Although several of the cast are actual hockey players (the actresses who played Komal, Nethra, and Raynia), all the girls attended a few months of rigorous hockey bootcamp. Too, while there are songs here (usually played over a training or game time montage), there aren't any extravagant song and dance numbers. For this movie, that's a good thing.

The cast of mostly unknowns makes it work. The story is peopled with the requisite bunch of misfits and outcasts, hailing from all parts of India (with some parts being decidedly provincial and backwatered). While it's noted that several of the girls are very easy on the eyes, the majority of the women's team aren't from the glam community. This, along with a certain rawness and a spirit in the performances, lends a more realistic feel to the film. Particular standouts are Chitrashi Rawat as the diminutive but oh-so-feisty Komal, Tanya Abrol as the hotheaded Balbir, Shilpa Shukla as the most experienced but very disruptive Bindia, Vidya Malvade as the quiet, newly married goalie and team captain Vidya, and Sagarika Ghage as the beautiful but selfish Preeti, determined to score the most goals (she has something to prove to her famous cricket-playing boyfriend, you see). Chitrashi and Sagarika have two of the strongest story arcs as they play two prolific scorers who refuse to pass to each other.

Shahrukh Khan can really act! Here, he veers away from his patented romantic roles, and really shows what he can do without the crutch of having a Rani or a Preity or a Kajol as love interests. Here, as the tough-minded coach, Shahrukh is tremendous, his acting very much controlled (we all know sometimes he goes overboard with the histrionics). While the girls are very winning, it's Shahrukh who holds everything together. But Shahrukh is generous enough that, in his scenes with them, he allows the girls to shine. Oh, and he develops an interesting scruff on his face.

The story isn't subtle or twisty. CHAK DE! INDIA, steeped in its underdog sports genre, unveils plot devices you see coming from a mile away. And yet it rises above its predictability by virtue of the cast's appeal and the film's understated tone and warmth. It also touches on issues topical to India: regionalism, sexism, religion (Hinduism vs. Islam), dirty sports politics, and hockey languishing in the shadow of cricket. Above all, it touches on the universal themes of patriotism and gender inequality. Yet the patriotism isn't overbearing, and you pull for these girls all the way as they make their mark on their sport.

Here's a long paragraph about the film's Special Features. Disc One has the film and the song selections. Disc Two is jam-full of bonus stuff: ""The Making Of"" feature (22 minutes long, but not enough focus on the female cast); 2 rousing music videos: ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" and ""Kuch Kariye""; the making of the ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" music video; a whopping 34 minutes of deleted scenes (including the girls celebrating to ""Dhoom Machale"" after the Men's Match, the girls playing the musical game Antakshari, and the India vs. Germany semi-finals match) - these extra sequences actually do flesh out the characters even more; the cast is featured and the film's impact is discussed in a talk show; ""Cult of CHAK DE: NDTV"" - hang out with three of the actresses (Vidya Malvade, Chitrashi Rawat & Shilpa Shukla )and three members of the India women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, as they all talk about the film; SRK shares his experience of screening the film with India's President Mrs. Pratibha Patil; the film's UK premiere at the Somerset House; a photo gallery and character bios; and the trailer & film promos. Overall, very worthwhile bonus stuff.

Something now from the When Movies and Real Life Collide department: CHAK DE! INDIA is loosely based on the real life India Women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games. Also, Kabir Khan's story bears a striking similarity to Mir Ranjan Negi's real life experiences. Negi, the goalkeeper in the India national hockey team, gave up 7 goals to Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games and was widely blamed for the loss, even being hailed as a traitor. Negi would partly redeem himself by coaching the Indian team that won the Gold Medal in the 1998 Asian Games and, later, by coaching the India women's national hockey team that struck gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Negi was hired on to this film to train the cast in playing field hockey.

One doesn't walk away from this film as suddenly intimate with the intricacies of field hockey, yet CHAK DE! INDIA breaks down the game enough that you do get the gist of the sport and appreciate what the girls are going thru. I thought this film was tremendous. CHAK DE! INDIA is right up there with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Once-Upon-a-Time-in-India/dp/B00005U124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iqbal/dp/B000I0RVI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iqbal</a>, in the realm of excellent sports films put out by Bollywood. Again, CHAK DE! INDIA is an example of what Bollywood is capable of when it eschews the dumbed-down humor, the exaggerated hanky-wringing, and the singing and dancing (although, don't get it twisted, I mostly dig the song and dance routines). Sometimes, a dose of grit and reality, of heart without sopping sentimentality, is what's called for. And CHAK DE! INDIA fits that bill. The commercial and critical success can't be a fluke, right? Just listen to that rallying cry: Chak de!",1210377600,15,7679,5.05524861878453
2987873,5,B000WOQKL2,"I saw this on an airplane and enjoyed it very much. It's the very involving story of the Indian women's field hockey team. Shah Rukh Khan plays their coach, but mainly the movie is about the young women on the team and how they overcome obstacles to work together.

I don't know why Yashpal and Co. is bending over backwards to deny this, except for one detail-- the real-life captain was Hindu, not Muslim. Oh well, Bollywood producers are as capable as is Hollywood to change the facts to make their point, so they can't be blamed for using this narrative device.

The players have their flaws, but he deals with them.
In this movie, he doesn't ham it up, with asides to the audience, etc. But, even though it is by and large not a comedy, it still has its moments.
I recommend this movie for its heart, and the girl actors, most of whom I had never seen before.

3222360,5,B000WOQKL2,"India is made up of 28 fiercely unique states that belong to India mostly because they might not fit elsewhere. Coaching hockey is easy compared to getting 16 women from all over India to self sacrifice and play together as a team.

There is some very funny self mocking humor in Chak de India, the best sports movie I have seen.  How many Indians can get out of one van? I'm confused, which one's Didi?  What does ""ho"" mean?  Can a women's field hockey team hold it's own in a fight against men? Can they win a game against men?

Shahrukh Khan, using less-is-more acting, seems to fit the part of the women's field hockey coach perfectly.  The assistant coach does a fine job of prividing a reference point from which to measure the ability of the head coach.  An incredibly dynamic cast of young women was pulled together and they do a wonderful job in their respective roles - including the women who played the opposing teams.  The Indian team is a dirty dozen plus a few, ranging from a big tough Punjabi girl to a little spark plug that won't quit to (Ho, Ho, Ho) Soimoi (her name, not a medical condition) a girl that rode out of the Jharkhand jungle on an elephant to join the Indian National Team.

There is no dancing, but one song is superb and sung really well.

Okay, this film is predictable since you know who is going to win the final game but you do not know how they are going to make it to the final, much less win.  We have watched this film quite a few times yet we still sit on the edge of our seats hoping they make each shot.  Sounds stupid, I know.

3222365,3,B000WOQKL2,"This Bollywood epic weighs in at the length of ""Gone With the Wind"" but the story of the ""Mighty Ducks."" Years after facing humiliating defeat on the field, former hockey star Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) returns to the game as coach of the Indian women's national hockey team, striving to shape a ragtag bunch of female athletes into a playing force to be reckoned with. His 16 recruits show up from every corner of India, a testiment to the ethnic diversity of that massive land. For the most part, they represent types rather than characters -- the spoiled rich girl, the tomboy, the shy one, the angry one etc etc. Khan's job is to meld them into a team, for as he observes, it's teamwork, not strength that wins world championships.
What elevates this a little over the usual biopic is the Indian setting. Khan is a Muslim -- he's denounced as a traitor to India after missing a vital shot in a match against Pakistan. But his heart still beats true and strong for the beloved homeland. There is an interesting feminist twist -- the women have to take on the Indian male team to persuade the sexists who run the hockey association to spend the money on them to go to the world championship. In one amusing scene, the women beat up a bunch of boorish men who are harrassing them at a fast-food restaurant.
Just about every scene of this movie is predictable as is the dialogue and the characters. But it still made for a fairly harmless and painless evening's entertainment.",1236988800,2,1476,4.573584905660377

I'm not a sports lover yet I found the hockey quite watchable. It isn't so much a sports movie but rather a story about personalities and nation.
SRK is restrained but excellent. He is not really the main focus of the movie though as he steps back and allows the girls centre stage. Given that they are mostly unknowns and not even actors mostly the girls did a great job.
A world match is played out in Melbourne (where I am from) and I must say they made the place look good - made me want to visit it!
While there is background music, this isn't a song and dance Bollywood - no dances and one sporting song.

3222369,5,B000WOQKL2,"Did you know that, once upon a time, India was a perennial world power in the sport of field hockey? That, from 1928 to 1980, India garnered eight gold medals in the Olympics? So you'd think hockey would have a larger following. Instead, cricket reigns today as India's most popular national pastime, with field hockey skulking somewhere in the back. CHAK DE! INDIA, in its own little way, takes one tiny step to change that.

CHAK DE! INDIA tells the inspiring fictional story of the India women's national hockey team, from the rocky formation of its newest crop of members to its triumphant quest for the World Cup. CHAK DE! INDIA also tells the story of one man's redemption. As the film opens, the Women's Hockey World Cup is three months away, and yet India's team still doesn't have a coach. Not too surprising, as it's a team disparaged by most, even by the Indian hockey's governing body, of which one member scornfully states that Indian women are born to cook and clean. Finally, in steps Kabir Khan, a disgraced former player of the India Men's National Hockey Team who, seven years ago, was accused of throwing a championship game to Pakistan. But now Kabir has come out of seclusion to become the India women's new coach. And he's got something to prove. Hell, the whole team has got something to prove. But, first, Kabir Khan has to turn this combative, mismatched, agenda-steeped bunch into a cohesive unit...

In CHAK DE! INDIA (""Go, India!""or, maybe, ""C'mon, India!""), Indian cinema refreshingly does away with its habitually overwrought melodrama and giddy romances. What we get is a simple story, told with impact and with restraint. It's one of the most entertaining and highest grossing Bollywood films of 2007. And why not? CHAK DE! INDIA is a superb underdog sports movie that'll strike a chord. The training sequences and the hockey matches are played out convincingly enough (at least, I didn't feel that the girls were faking it). Although several of the cast are actual hockey players (the actresses who played Komal, Nethra, and Raynia), all the girls attended a few months of rigorous hockey bootcamp. Too, while there are songs here (usually played over a training or game time montage), there aren't any extravagant song and dance numbers. For this movie, that's a good thing.

The cast of mostly unknowns makes it work. The story is peopled with the requisite bunch of misfits and outcasts, hailing from all parts of India (with some parts being decidedly provincial and backwatered). While it's noted that several of the girls are very easy on the eyes, the majority of the women's team aren't from the glam community. This, along with a certain rawness and a spirit in the performances, lends a more realistic feel to the film. Particular standouts are Chitrashi Rawat as the diminutive but oh-so-feisty Komal, Tanya Abrol as the hotheaded Balbir, Shilpa Shukla as the most experienced but very disruptive Bindia, Vidya Malvade as the quiet, newly married goalie and team captain Vidya, and Sagarika Ghage as the beautiful but selfish Preeti, determined to score the most goals (she has something to prove to her famous cricket-playing boyfriend, you see). Chitrashi and Sagarika have two of the strongest story arcs as they play two prolific scorers who refuse to pass to each other.

Shahrukh Khan can really act! Here, he veers away from his patented romantic roles, and really shows what he can do without the crutch of having a Rani or a Preity or a Kajol as love interests. Here, as the tough-minded coach, Shahrukh is tremendous, his acting very much controlled (we all know sometimes he goes overboard with the histrionics). While the girls are very winning, it's Shahrukh who holds everything together. But Shahrukh is generous enough that, in his scenes with them, he allows the girls to shine. Oh, and he develops an interesting scruff on his face.

The story isn't subtle or twisty. CHAK DE! INDIA, steeped in its underdog sports genre, unveils plot devices you see coming from a mile away. And yet it rises above its predictability by virtue of the cast's appeal and the film's understated tone and warmth. It also touches on issues topical to India: regionalism, sexism, religion (Hinduism vs. Islam), dirty sports politics, and hockey languishing in the shadow of cricket. Above all, it touches on the universal themes of patriotism and gender inequality. Yet the patriotism isn't overbearing, and you pull for these girls all the way as they make their mark on their sport.

Here's a long paragraph about the film's Special Features. Disc One has the film and the song selections. Disc Two is jam-full of bonus stuff: ""The Making Of"" feature (22 minutes long, but not enough focus on the female cast); 2 rousing music videos: ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" and ""Kuch Kariye""; the making of the ""Ek Hockey Doongi Rakhke"" music video; a whopping 34 minutes of deleted scenes (including the girls celebrating to ""Dhoom Machale"" after the Men's Match, the girls playing the musical game Antakshari, and the India vs. Germany semi-finals match) - these extra sequences actually do flesh out the characters even more; the cast is featured and the film's impact is discussed in a talk show; ""Cult of CHAK DE: NDTV"" - hang out with three of the actresses (Vidya Malvade, Chitrashi Rawat & Shilpa Shukla )and three members of the India women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, as they all talk about the film; SRK shares his experience of screening the film with India's President Mrs. Pratibha Patil; the film's UK premiere at the Somerset House; a photo gallery and character bios; and the trailer & film promos. Overall, very worthwhile bonus stuff.

Something now from the When Movies and Real Life Collide department: CHAK DE! INDIA is loosely based on the real life India Women's hockey team who won the gold medal in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games. Also, Kabir Khan's story bears a striking similarity to Mir Ranjan Negi's real life experiences. Negi, the goalkeeper in the India national hockey team, gave up 7 goals to Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games and was widely blamed for the loss, even being hailed as a traitor. Negi would partly redeem himself by coaching the Indian team that won the Gold Medal in the 1998 Asian Games and, later, by coaching the India women's national hockey team that struck gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Negi was hired on to this film to train the cast in playing field hockey.

One doesn't walk away from this film as suddenly intimate with the intricacies of field hockey, yet CHAK DE! INDIA breaks down the game enough that you do get the gist of the sport and appreciate what the girls are going thru. I thought this film was tremendous. CHAK DE!

INDIA is an example of what Bollywood is capable of when it eschews the dumbed-down humor, the exaggerated hanky-wringing, and the singing and dancing (although, don't get it twisted, I mostly dig the song and dance routines). Sometimes, a dose of grit and reality, of heart without sopping sentimentality, is what's called for. And CHAK DE! INDIA fits that bill. The commercial and critical success can't be a fluke, right? Just listen to that rallying cry: Chak de!",1210377600,15,7679,5.05524861878453
3222370,5,B000WOQKL2,"I saw this on an airplane and enjoyed it very much. It's the very involving story of the Indian women's field hockey team. Shah Rukh Khan plays their coach, but mainly the movie is about the young women on the team and how they overcome obstacles to work together. (This is not your usual Bollywood movie--there's no singing or dancing.)

The spirit is similar to Bend It Like Beckham, but I think I liked this movie even better. A great choice for families or anyone who likes an unusual sports story.",1209859200,4,502,4.516483516483516
3222371,5,B000WOQKL2,"For those unaware of the fact: There was, indeed, a former captain of the Indian Men's Hockey Team whose error cost India the World championships-- and who, seven years later, led the newly formed Indian Women's Hockey team to the Commonwealth Women's Hockey Championship in its first-ever international performance. I don't know why Yashpal and Co. is bending over backwards to deny this, except for one detail-- the real-life captain was Hindu, not Muslim. Oh well, Bollywood producers are as capable as is Hollywood to change the facts to make their point, so they can't be blamed for using this narrative device. I do wish they made the point explicitly in their promo materials though-- it would give the former captain of the Indian Hockey Team the credit he justly deserves.",1202256000,,781,4.969465648854962

Showcases how quickly people can turn on you when you make a mistake that can happen to anyone, and the guilt and condemnation people sometimes have to endure until they climb back up to the top in the minds of their people. Even if they were never less than at the top to begin with.",1485734400,,368,4.507462686567164
8224446,5,B000WOQKL2,"This is an interesting and entertaining sports movie. The outer wrapping was dusty and made me think I was getting an old used video. But inside it was brand new and in good condition. Maybe it is my lack of technical knowledge, but I couldn't find how to make it fill the screen. The story and acting from everyone is wonderful and one of my three favorites starring Shah Rukh Khan. (The other two are: Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, and Jab Tak Hai Jaan. And though Don 2 and Ra One are tacky in the beginning, I still like the movies.) SRK plays a serious role in this film and did a marvelous job. There isn't any singing and dancing like there are in many of his other Bollywood movies. I think they used one of his songs as background music in a few of the scenes, but it didn't distract you from the serious subject matter. One of the aspects I appreciate about the roles I've seen him in so far, is that he is not abusive toward women, but respects and believes in their freedom and abilities. It makes me wonder if he is like that in real life.",1484611200,,1043,4.1683168316831685
8224447,5,B000WOQKL2,"One of the better made Bollywood movies of recent time. It captures the nuances of how government sports committees run Indian national teams. The internal strife of folks from different states of India, the various family backgrounds, social strata, Indian outlook towards any other sport than Cricket etc. is very well depicted. For once, Shahrukh Khan acts his age instead of playing a typical romantic lead. He proves yet again that given a good script & strong direction he is quite capable of being a restrained actor. The supporting cast is brilliant (many of them debuts) and gets almost equal footing. All in all a good movie worth recommending.",1483920000,,654,5.009174311926605
