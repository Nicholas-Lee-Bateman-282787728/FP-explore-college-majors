7915479,3,B00002AFX4,"This movie would have been much better with Bruce Campbell in the lead and Bill Campbell playing the smaller role.  Bill didn't impress me in this movie, and I normally like his films.  Bruce has little time on film in this one, but his was enjoyable as always to watch.",1223596800,6,270,4.38
7915480,2,B00002AFX4,"This is another one of those future societies where man's quest for self satisfaction is the major motivator of daily living.  Too bad director Jon Kroll didn't enliven it with some good acting or great action scenes.  As it is, we get Bruce Campbell for a few minutes as an underground rebel leader who when fatally shot downloads his brain into a computer.  Nerdy computer geek Bill Campbell is then forced by the tough Stephanie Romanov to download Bruce's brain into his own so he can find out what it is that Brucie knew about an impending computer disaster.  Corbin Bernsen (gleefully vile as usual) is an evil guy who is running for President and has decided to use the Resort to influence votes.
The acting is negligible to say the least and the pace is snail-like at best.
Could have been better, but no cigar this time!",1085702400,3,829,4.581081081081081
7915481,2,B00002AFX4,"I got this movie for two reasons: 1. It's being sold in Russia on the black market as ""The Matrix 2."" 2. It has Bruce Campbell in it. Unfortunately, Bruce isn't in the movie for long, as he is killed off early in the picture. The rest of the film is pretty bad, being your typical DTV picture, but there are some good qualities to it. Michael Dorn is good as Menno's best friend, and there is some good humor. But most of the movie is very silly with terrible acting and pretty subpar action. I guess if you like ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" you'll like this one.",1043280000,4,553,4.226415094339623
7915482,3,B00002AFX4,"there are some good qualities to this movie, it fits the genre of a futuristic sci-fi where a powerful G-man is vying for the presidency in a fascist/democratic America. But it does fail in many areas, like action and budget. The language and acting is really good though, and Corbin Bernsen made a great bad guy. The real reason to watch this movie though is Stephanie Romanov, no bouncing action, but what a fox.",984009600,3,414,4.608108108108108
7915483,2,B00002AFX4,"I got this video and was excited by the possible plot, and bruce cambell is usually good.  To cut to the chase this is dissapointing.  It has a relative good idea, but the script is one-dimensional at best.  The acting  it sub par, the director never even gave bruce a chance to be bruce.  Not  to say this was a horrible film, it was ok, for a late night showtime film,  or something. I wouldn't recommend it unless it's on television, or a movie  channel, and there's nothing else on.",953078400,4,486,4.322222222222222
