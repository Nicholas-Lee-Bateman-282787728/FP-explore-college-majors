With lots of different shots of beautiful fall colours and scenery this will transport you into a world of beauty. This would be great to relax to in the evening after work or when you want to travel without going anywhere. The length is good and the DVDs arrived nicely packaged. I'm hoping to find more of these. Definitely recommended to nature lovers everywhere.",1510012800,,455,4.62962962962963

8764858,5,B01H7O3B8E,"Beautiful fall colors, very relaxing.  Three sections of DVD include:  1) Fall Film includes many scenes of multi color trees, lakes, rain falling on trees and leaves, large spider webs and leaves glistening with rain, streams flowing over large boulders, streams flowing under stone bridges, etc.  2) Soothing Scenes includes many slow flowing wide streams edged by trees with slivers of sunlight lsparkling on the water  3) ""Natural Decor""  is four scenes, each of a different waterfall, choice of playing an individual waterfall or ""play all.""  Natural sounds include water and bird sounds.",1478304000,10,593,5.32258064516129
8764859,4,B01H7O3B8E,"Two relaxation DVD set.  Both discs start out exactly the same and there are several scenes that are the same on both discs.  If I am purchasing 2 different DVDs, even if they are in a set, I expect them to be different.
Disc. 1  Fall
This disc is by far the best one in the set.  Choice of 3 different tracks set to nature sounds.  The scene selections and photography is spectacular once the camera focuses in on the scene.  It is difficult to tell the purpose of this DVD since some scenes seem to center on photography effects and others seem to just accent the beautiful nature.  In a relaxation DVD I want it to just focus on the vivid nature  which needs no added special effects.  (i.e., fade outs, blurry focus, all orange, misty looking, etc.)  The scenes that have no special effects are outstanding!  I love how the camera just stays on these beautiful shots - I could watch them all day long.  Absolutely stunning lakes, rushing rivers, waterfalls, and LOTS of vivid fall colors.  Very nice sound tracks of gentle water, rain and bird sounds.
Disc. 2:  Choice of 4 Forest Seasons set to soothing, soft music and 4 selections of Relaxation Tracks with very nice bird sounds.  For the most part, the scenes and locations chosen to film are uninteresting and lackluster with the photography shots more focused on camera technique (being very orange and faded/misty looking) rather than accenting all the different vibrant colors of fall.  Personally I don't care for close ups of insects - I kept feeling like I should run for the flyswatter!
The exception was the Autumn track which included beautiful, vibrant colors, a waterfall and a very good selection of scenes, especially the fall colors reflecting on the water  outstanding!  The close- ups of the frost on the pines in the Winter track was done extremely well.  Overall I was pretty disappointed with Disc 2 since I enjoyed only about 10% of it.",1477094400,5,1915,4.6626865671641795
8764860,5,B01H7O3B8E,"Colors of the Forest collection is truly a peaceful and relaxing dvd set. Love playing the video in the background and bringing the gentle sounds of nature into my home. I have purchased several DVD's from The Ambient Collection, to include their nature and virtual exercise videos. I have enjoyed them all and been extremely pleased.",1475712000,3,334,4.982142857142857
8764861,1,B01H7O3B8E,"I make my living as an artist. I was expecting clear crisp fall color. The scenes continually change focus like they were shot through some type of filter, then they become clear again. It strainend my eyes and gave me a headache to watch. Nature needs no embellishment. Save your money.",1475280000,5,287,4.647058823529412
8764862,5,B01H7O3B8E,"m living in a city center and when I look through my window I only see concrete buildings. This DVD collection is my escape to nature when Im not able to actually go to the forest. Fall is such a colorful season and this DVD collection shows Fall in all its glory. The colors are so bright and vivid. I love that I can choose to watch a video with beautiful relaxation music or with the sounds of nature. I choose the music when I play the DVDs in the background, while Im working or reading and the sounds of nature during my morning meditation.
The Fall DVD has a one-hour film with beautiful scenes of dawn forests, carpets of fallen leaves and tumbling waterfalls. Its pure magic and endless relaxation.
I think my favorite track is Misty Morning Lake on the Forest Season DVD. Its such a serene landscape, with the soft rippling water, the magical mist and the mountains in the backdrop.
If you are looking for relaxation (and whos not?) and want to escape to nature whenever you feel like, this is your DVD!",1474070400,7,1013,4.422459893048129
