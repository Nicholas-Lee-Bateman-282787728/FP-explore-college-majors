My kids are 4 and 6 and were able to understand enough of what was going on to be enthralled, and the adults in the house were interested as well. It was all focused on the job and the experience of being an astronaut. There wasn't any biographical aspect. It is the story of the launch of space shuttle Discovery (plus a bit of prep) through its return 15 days later, as narrated by astronaut Pam Melroy, commander of this mission. There is TONS of footage of astronauts in space doing a variety of work, and clips from interviews with astronauts. They explicitly advocate studying math and science (especially for girls). They show how they handle a problem with unfolding the International Space Station solar panels, and mention that the ensuing spacewalk is dangerous, but there is no obvious peril.  They emphasize the importance of their relationship with mission control. There is more content on the DVD that I haven't watched yet. Yes, the animation is a bit cheesy, but if you like astronauts and space exploration, you will like this.

8348629,4,B0020QPM7I,"I found this DVD story very interesting.  While it incorporates Pam's history leading up to the shuttle flight to the International Space Station, for which she was commander, it also does a great job is showing what life is like in space - floating weightlessly, etc.  I thinnk one really gets the feel of it.

The pictures of the space station and earth are excellant.  Although the NASA web site contains all sorts of pictures from space and the space station, I think this video provides more close-ups and is done is a very person way.

The story also provides insight into what is involved, for an individual to become an astronaut.

I have enhanced interest in the DVD, for two reasons.  First, I has seen four shuttle launched from Cape Canaveral.  One of them was in 2003 when the Columbia was launched, only to burn up on re-entry a few weeks later.  The most recent launch I watched was in November of this year (2009).

Second, I know her parents, here in Rochester, NY, who belong to the same ski club.  They showed this DVD at a club meeting, and that sparked me to purchase it for my grandson, who is ""all about space"".",1260921600,,1134,4.482926829268293
