7812261,5,6301216199,"i got it fast. This movie is out of print and hard to find. It is for dedicated Zappa fans only.  Of which I am one, but even I thought it was tedious and boring after the first 30 to 45 minutes. Thats when most of the music ends. Still, I'm glad i got it.  There are many other great concert videos of Frank out there, thank god, so don't let this one ""slow"" one discourage your quest for the master. If you truly love Frank Zappa, check out some You-Tubes from ""Zappanale"".  A wonderful 3 day music fest each summer in Bad Doberan, Germany.  Better yet join me there again next August for my 7th time. You'll be among 3 to 5 thousand fellow Mothers/Brothers. so the crowd isn't too big.",1347408000,3,688,4.1893939393939394
7812262,4,6301216199,"This is one of those movies where you get it or you don't.  Fans of screwed up absurdist humor will likely love it as Zappa is mainly depicting how warped his friends, bandmates, and himself are through a succession of rapid fire edits and mini skits.  If that's not your cup of tea, then you might wanna sit this one out as it's likely to cause annoyance.  There is some seriously funny material here and was hurting afterward from my laughter the first time I saw it.  Superior to 200 Motels IMHO.  A good one for repeated viewing as it is pretty densely packed with a glorious insanity that is rare in the world of film.",1179446400,6,623,4.336206896551724
7812263,5,6301216199,"WHY ISN'T THIS OUT ON DVD????? Uncle Meat is a work of genius that has stood the test of time - a brilliant dissection of the commercial music industry and art in general. The film offers great comedy, surreal footage and awesome avant garde musical performances. Frank Zappa is a genius! The best part is you can watch this again and again and never get bored, every time you discover something new. This has to be my favorite movie of all time. Highly recommended.

7812264,2,6301216199,"Man, I'm a pretty big Zappa fan, but this isn't the easiest movie to sit through.  If you've seen 200 Motels, you have a basic idea of what to expect from Zappa the film-maker.  However, while 200 Motels was bizarre, Uncle Meat is just plain inane.  The movie follows no direction at all.  Scenes of people talking about unrelated things are just stitched together to make the movie.  The one thing that makes the movie worth seeing is the performance of the concert that appears on the ""Ahead Of Their Time"" CD.  Even that isn't really enough to encourage anyone to pay anything over [dollar amount] for the movie.  [...]",1006905600,18,622,4.6
