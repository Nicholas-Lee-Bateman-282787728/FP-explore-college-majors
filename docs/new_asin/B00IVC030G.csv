6299772,5,B00IVC030G,"I was lucky enough to get a copy of this documentary almost right after it came out. Plastic Galaxy does a GREAT job at taking you back to the 70's and 80's and will undoubtedly make you relive the happy childhood moments that you had while playing with the action figures.

The documentary will appeal several groups of people, which is why I'm saying that it works at different levels. Those who collect / collected the action figures will be more than pleased as it includes documentaries with dedicated collectors who share their stories (Stephen Sansweet among them). It will also satisfy those who are toy design enthusiasts as well as people who enjoy learning about concept development. All in all, it's guaranteed to please everyone who spent more than one childhood afternoon playing with ""Star Wars guys"" in their backyard.

Plastic Galaxy is well structured, entertaining, visually appealing and it's overall a WONDERFUL documentary. You'll want to watch it several times and may find yourself pausing the video and pointing at figures and ships on several occasions.",1395014400,,1079,5.056179775280899
6299773,5,B00IVC030G,If you're a fan of Star Wars toys. A fan of Star Wars in general. Or if you loved being a kid in the late 70s-mid 80s. This DVD is for you. The best part of this movie for me is the stories told buy everyday collectors. It's amazing how all our childhood memories of Star Wars and the toys are different from each other but exactly the same at the same time. My only regret is it wasn't longer. Just go buy it. You'll love it.,1395014400,,426,3.9080459770114944
6299774,5,B00IVC030G,"You're clearly a Star Wars fanatic if you're even on this page, so why the hell haven't you put this DVD in your basket yet? This is *the* definitive documentary on the history of Star Wars toys, so if you love 'em like these filmmakers clearly do, buying this great indie doc is a no-brainer. Of course I wish it were longer, but I also wish that I had a rancor, so it seems that my wishes are destined to remain unfulfilled. Just watch the DVD extras and thank the force that bigger nerds than you plunked down their money to make this film happen.",1394928000,7,550,4.247619047619048
6299775,5,B00IVC030G,"As a fellow Kickstarter contributor to this project (and a vintage Star Wars toy collector myself) i had high hopes for this film, and they were all met. While paying respectable tribute to the toys and the collectors, it was also the first time we've ever got to meet the designers and people behind some of these beloved toys from over 30 years ago. All in all, a great documentary that's well put together. My only complaint was that it wasn't longer. :)",1394928000,14,457,4.518072289156627
6299776,5,B00IVC030G,"Plastic Galaxy, the Story of Star Wars Toys is a great documentary about the toys that really defined the play of millions of kids in the late 70s and early 80s.  As a child of that era I loved my Star Wars action figures.  I had tons of these guys (and still do, don't judge) and so this was a trip down memory lane. The movie covers both the fan following that started in that era, the history of how these toys came to be and their lasting impact, featuring interviews with experts and authors on collecting and former Kenner employees.  It's a light documentary, keeping things as fun as the toys were themselves.  Collectors recount their early experiences (which are similar for most of us out there) as well as give you tons of information about the toys.  Kenner alumni give us peeks behind the scenes as designs and product concepts went from the drawing tables (quite literally) to the store shelves.  At 70 minutes it's brief, but that brevity will keep even the casual viewer involved for the entire run time.  There are a few nice bonus features on the DVD but I would have loved to see more since I'm such a huge fan of the toys.  This is a quirky indie documentary that turned to crowd funding to get this finished and after seeing the results I can only hope they do more.  In the meantime, we can all support the filmmakers and show our love for these little 3 3/4"" plastic guys by picking up the documentary without delay.",1394409600,8,1440,4.424242424242424

6299794,3,B00IVC030G,"Fun glimpse behind the making of the classic Kenner Star Wars line of toys, with interviews with collectors and the actual toy designers. Pretty much everything discussed is common knowledge to collectors, but a few bits of key info (like how the figures came to be 3.75-in. tall) are surprisingly missing. But the pace is quick, and, with a running time of just a bit over an hour, it doesn't outstay its welcome or drag--and there is enough good info for the casual collector, those looking to reminisce, or those who enjoy the culture that surrounded Star Wars during the original trilogy.",1479168000,,592,4.813725490196078

6299812,4,B00IVC030G,I love how these stories evolve by people having no clue what they are doing and just making things up as they go.  This covers the background on merchandising for Star Wars and the company that was willing to risk it all to make it.  I think we all know ow that turns out but it's still very interesting to see the turn of events that brought them to the outcome and seeing the people that made it happen.,1474502400,,406,4.1265822784810124

And the Boba Fete that I distinctly remember being offered with the firing rocket, on the back of some exciting card.
If only we knew to keep the plastic capes on, and our Jawas in their cloth gowns(or plastic capes). And I'm pretty sure my best friend had the Blue Snaggletooth that came with a cheap-cardboard Sears cantina set.
Hours of fun we had.
All of the young collectors in this film are my age, and in keeping with tradition of Star Wars(IV A New Hope), there is only one female in this film.
Star Wars, and Star Wars toys focused my early years, in a great direction. And this wonderful documentary reminded me of so much.

6299861,5,B00IVC030G,"Very well done. A thoughtful, informative and entertaining look at the serendipitous growth of Kenner toys through it's relationship with the Star Wars franchise. Kenner practically invented movie toy marketing as we know it today. This doc explores the appeal of the toys through interviews with toy collectors, Kenner modeling artists and Kenner marketing people from the era. Seems everyone at that time was caught by surprise at the overwhelming popularity of the Star Wars franchise, and Kenner was lucky enough to be on the ground floor of the boom, and savvy enough to not only make it profitable, but to also create an entirely new collecting hobby that has spanned the decades without loss of popularity. Highly entertaining! I am clearing the shelves for some Star Wars toys!

Its a great doc getting into the early Kenner Years and it's industry-changing marketing partnership with Lucasfilm.

6299900,5,B00IVC030G,"This may be the most detailed documentary on Star Wars merchandising -- toys, specifically -- for public viewing.  Stephen Sansweet, the keeper of the vault at Rancho Obiwan, put this together, and the film covers the history of Kenner toys, the struggle to get a manufacturer for the Star Wars license, the photography and marketing, the death (and rebirth) of the line, and how to tell if your neighbor's rocket-firing Boba Fett is authentic.  Hint:  it's not.
Any real toy collector, especially a Star Wars action figure collector, needs to watch this documentary.  It won't appeal to most people, so you may have to watch it alone.  That shouldn't be a problem, though, because most of us are used to doing things alone.",1461024000,2,724,4.853658536585366

6299995,5,B00IVC030G,"This was a very enjoyable look at the world of Star Wars toys. It might appeal more to those with a history in either collecting or playing with the old 70s and 80s Kenner line, and that's exactly who wrote and spoke in this movie. An added bonus was the interviews with former Kenner employees that were directly involved with the Star Wars line. I only wished it was longer and had more interviews and details, especially regarding rare collectibles and forgotten Star Wars items (that Star Wars wallpaper brought me whooshing back to my childhood!).",1453420800,,552,4.760416666666667

There is enough of the toy company production staff involved in the documentary to call it a documentary.  The lengths to which the film is dedicated to the toy collectors, is a bit much, also, there are no girl toy collectors interviewed for the first-person aspect.

Shown here also is the collectible mania that followed many of us into adulthood and the reasons why these toys hold such nostalgic value.

6300024,4,B00IVC030G,"This is a great documentary.  It's a lot of fun to watch, especially for folks of my age who grew up with the classic Kenner Star Wars line.  The shots of the toy store shelves lined to the roof with Star Wars product make me nostalgic, and a bit sad- the paltry offerings of today's stores make it impossible to just walk in and find any figure one might want.  The current market sees the release of only a subset of figures each period, so that not all figures are available at any one time.  Has made it very, very difficult to get a collection going for my son and daughter...

  But I digress.  This documentary covers the genesis of the Star Wars line, and follows it to its ultimate demise and revival with the Power of the Force figures.  It's definitely worth a watch.  May the Force be with you!",1446422400,,806,4.2781456953642385

6300071,2,B00IVC030G,"Fair warning, this is a review of the film itself and not of the physical release. For more information on that, look to other reviews.

With that out of the way, I have to say that despite my rating I actually enjoyed Plastic Galaxy. A 2/5 doesn't have to be bad if there's some value to the content within. The main problem with Plastic Galaxy is that it was clear that these filmmakers did not have access to certain Star Wars/Lucasfilm properties, which wouldn't have been surprising even if they didn't have to contend with Disney for that content. In other words, instead of seeing the ""Star Wars"" logo or the ""In a galaxy far, far away"" opening which they clearly wanted to show at one point, you simply see a still picture of the 20th Century Fox logo along with the 20th Century Fox sting. This type of moment happens far too frequently, which suggests that the documentary was shot on a shoestring budget, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

That being said, it wasn't just the lack of content that hurt the film, it was also the editing choices. Rather than fade into the 20th Century Fox still, they just go straight from black to the still, which isn't really what I would have done. I'm no professional editor, but I gotta feel like some sense of movement or importance is better than just ""BAM! HERE'S THE LOGO!"" There were editing problems like this throughout, as well as filter choices that were questionable at best and ugly at worst. This film simply wasn't edited very well, and the lack of content only made the poor editing stick out even more.

Now that I've gotten the negatives out of the way, I think it's time to explain why I didn't just give it one star: The documentary was incredibly informative. Despite its many issues, the experts and fans they spoke to for this documentary were so knowledgeable that it was hard to deny the value of the information. Perhaps the film itself was poorly edited and felt somewhat amateur, but the interviews were so fantastic that I didn't even care all that much. Collecting interviews is a huge and important part of documentary filmmaking, and although they may have failed in other areas, their ability to gather all of these people together and get some solid information out of them is worth praising.

Love it or hate it, Plastic Galaxy is definitely worth the watch if you want to know more about the history of Star Wars toys, and in fact the history of Toys in the late 70's. There is a bevvy of information here that, at times, is coming straight from the source. For that experience alone, Plastic Galaxy is a more than worthy film.",1437177600,,2616,4.571428571428571

It showcases STAR WARS' -unexpected- epic success, ushering in the action figure explosion. In retrospect, it's astonishing that no one but the Kenner toy company was interested in making the SW tie-in toys. However, it's clear that no one in the mid-1970's really believed that the films would be around long enough to make toys worthwhile. As the films became increasingly popular, the quality of the figures improved. In addition to the collectors, the toy designers and artists tell their stories. Also contains snippets of vintage STAR WARS toy commercials. Anyone of a certain age will love this trip through childhood memories. Others may wonder what all the fuss was about.

I would have loved to see some footage of the actual sculpting - not just the finished wax model - and casting processes - perhaps a comparison to how they use computers to do so much of the design work now.  It talks about the lack of information that they initially got from Lucas Films, but there was little said about the approval meetings and what types of things the designers were judged on when the decision was made whether or not to put their item into production. I did, however, LOVE the mention of the ""buff-ening"" of the rerelease figures.  We have a Lando that would make Hulk Hogan weep and it cracks me up every time it get played with.

I could actually sign up and become an official Star Wars fan member and purchase Luke, Leia, R2-D2, and Chewbacca action figures before they were ever sold in the stores. As a 7 year-old I was totally hooked and still have the original four action figures in my Darth Vader action figure collector's case. It was crazy to see the designer who created the Early Bird Special talk about the process and the doubts the Kenner executives had concerning the marketing idea.
  Hasbro really pulled at my nostalgia heart strings when they released the 30th Anniversary Early Bird Special commemorating the original four figures. Now that I am all grown up (big kid still inside though) I passed on the Star Wars passion to my children having pulled them out of elementary school for each of the first showings of Episodes I, II, and III just like my Grandfather had done with me when I was 7 years old. I'm sure if Kathleen Kennedy continues to make Star Wars movies for another 10 years I'll be taking my grandchildren to see the first showing of the new movies as well.
  On a side note:  I'm seriously thinking about making an offer on the craigslist Star Destroyer listing. I wonder if the moisture farmer will take a check. If you know what I'm talking about in these last two sentences, you really are a Star Wars geek.

The pros: it is really thorough in its research of what led to the toy company Kenner getting the license for these toys, as well as how the incredible success of the toy line changed the company. There are a lot of wonderful items being shown that you probably could never own without paying thousands of dollars. The documentary really leaves you wanting to see more.
The cons: right now, it is only available on DVD, and probably will never be released in blu-ray; the only way to watch an HD version, apparently, is getting it on the iTunes Store. But that version doesn't include the special features.
Another odd thing is that almost 90% of the people interviewed in the documentary are white males - the Star Wars phenomenon has touched so many people all over the world that it is unfortunate that the main viewpoint here is that of mostly well-off white guys with very little space dedicated to women and/or Latinos, and absolutely no African-Americans being interviewed.",1417478400,2,1092,4.783068783068783

6300144,4,B00IVC030G,"It had to start somewhere right? My obsession with collecting action figures can easily be tracked back to (and blamed on) the release of Star Wars action figures from the original trilogy. Never in the history of man has a phenomenom of this scale been recorded! Plastic Galaxy coverNo one can deny the impact that these little pieces of plastic would have have on the world and our wallets. So would you like to know more about why and how Star Wars took over the toy aisles and your toy chests? Then this film is for you!

Plastic Galaxy: The Story of Star Wars Toys is a documentary by X-Ray Films (bio here) that explores what happened when Star Wars took merchandising to the next level and the effect that it would have through today! It was crowdfunded through Kickstarter and is available to purchase now. Since Disney now owns the holy franchise, you know that they will only continue their marketing onslaught when it comes to selling products based on new and old characters alike. I would guess that Star Wars memorabilia makes up for at least 75% of my toy collection and it is only growing (just wait until Episode VII hits!).  The documentary explores why the series had such an impact on the toy industry and why it has continued to this day. The filmmakers do a nice job of incorporating interviews with ex-Kenner employees that worked at the company during the high-times. If you have watched The Toy Hunter on the Travel Channel, then some of these faces should be familiar. Plastic Galaxy is full of fun facts and history from the early days of the line up to its current standing. It is really amazing to see how well these figures have flourished throughout the years, even with being handed over to another company in the 90's!

With the buyout of Lucasfilm by Disney, everything that came before is merely the beginning for our favorite sci-fi franchise! I'm sure that X-Ray Films will be able to put out another documentary in 10 years!

It has been my passion for as long as I can remember having been with the line since the 12 back figures.  I hope I enjoy Episode VII as much as I enjoyed Plastic Galaxy. If you grew up with the vintage Kenner line at any point you will be utterly engrossed by this documentary.

I found myself constantly nodding as the collectors retold their stories and sometimes even saying ""YES!"" out loud.  Despite not knowing any of them personally, it's clear we all shared a bond during this era. If you remember crossing off the figures you owned on the ""Collect All"" cardback with a magic marker, this will definitely hit you right at home.

But the real thrill of the documentary is insight into Kenner itself.  The interviews with the Kenner employees will have me watching  Plastic Galaxy over and over.",1406505600,5,911,4.5182926829268295
6300152,4,B00IVC030G,At 70 minutes it falls short of being rated 5 stars. This video is a must have for anyone that collected star wars figures during their childhood. A great documentary but I just wish there was more details about the different toy lines. Also there was not much information about the newer toy lines after the 80's.,1405555200,,314,4.526315789473684
6300153,4,B00IVC030G,"It was a great little documentary, I just wish it was longer. Or there were more bonus features! That's just my way of saying I really enjoyed it.",1404172800,,146,4.25
6300154,5,B00IVC030G,"If you're like me, a child of the late 70's/early 80's, then your life probably revolved around Kenner Star Wars action figures and toys. This awesome documentary features interviews with collectors and the actual creators of the toys. And if the original commercials for the toys don't make you nostalgic, nothing will.",1402358400,2,320,5.173076923076923
6300155,5,B00IVC030G,Very interesting if you are a Star Wars fan. Brings back great memories. I would recommend this to any Star Wars fan.,1400198400,,117,4.363636363636363
6300156,5,B00IVC030G,"A wonderful look at the history and impact of Star Wars toys, this DVD (and the must-see bonus features) contain hours of rare images, video and stories. I particularly loved the interviews with former Kenner staff who told the tales of products that were planned, or even built, but never released.

If you collect anything Star Wars, or toys in general... or if you've ever played with a toy, you will enjoy this video.",1395014400,,421,4.6891891891891895

It was boring and stupid.

I didn't bother watching more than 10 minutes of dumb statements by ex-users.",1532304000,,133,4.28
8645638,1,B00IVC030G,Congratulations you made Star Wars toys boring there are much more interesting documentaries on YouTube or check out The Toys That Made Us,1530403200,,138,5.043478260869565

8645640,2,B00IVC030G,History documentary foucus a bit too much on the collectors instead of the product. Sound editing is pretty bad and added dramatic music is a bit ridiculous..,1516579200,,158,4.888888888888889

8645644,5,B00IVC030G,"Great feature, loved seeing all the different collections. Very informative about the Kenner brand, and history. And the snip it's about some of the characters, and how they came to be. Would love a part II. With more info on each character, too bad so much of the toys were made outside of the United States, Kenner involved in the destruction of American jobs. Oh well, over all a great documentary.",1485734400,,401,4.661971830985915
