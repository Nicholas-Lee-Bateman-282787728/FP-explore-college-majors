8057119,5,B00094ASFE,I really enjoyed this DVD.  I learned a lot more about the life of JP II.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in church history.,1361577600,,136,4.0
8057120,4,B00094ASFE,"What is included is very, very good.  However, I found myself wondering about the last years of his pontificate.  After a certain point, nothing was said.  I felt like I'd been pushed off a cliff -- at first, everything was fine and then there was nothing!",1354579200,,256,4.521739130434782
8057121,4,B00094ASFE,"I enjoyed Biography's coverage of the late Pope John Paul II.

The video is too brief only 40 minutes long.  The first 20 minutes talk about the years before his Pontificate. The last 20 minutes cover the time as Pope. It ends rather abruptly.  Also, the video was filmed in the late 90's, six years before his passing on. There is no coverage of his final six years.

For a pope who accomplished so much, I felt the covergage was too little.  There are good interviews with Childhood friends of the Pope as well as one of his Biographers, Tad Szulc. One major theme is that this Pope helped bring a peaceful end to communism in Poland.

The effort is well done but I found myself wanting more details and broader coverage.

The DVD extras that are included are only text.

Biography has done a good job one the video however if you only want to purchase one video, purchase Witness to Hope by Weigel.",1199059200,,901,4.418181818181818
