7799755,1,1596686766,"Sara believes ignorance is a virtue, because the free artistic spirit is not contaminated with knowledge or thinking.  She flaunts the fact that she could not be bothered to look up what terms mean (it took 10 seconds to look up fiber ""lap"" with Google, but she mentioned several times that though she was demonstrating with it she didn't really know what it is), examine the attributes of her fiber (she didn't know the micron count but a quick call to the supplier would have given her this fact), spin with a plan (she just says she always spins a certain way without giving a reason or acknowledging other options), know how much twist is inserted into singles or plies (""until it looks like beads""), or how to select an appropriate use.  She has a basket of various kinds of silk, spins each in the identical manner which she refuses to describe more than this: take a handful, pretend it is cotton, go fast and don't worry about mistakes, spin it until your hand feels that it is right.  Cotton?  Cotton is short stapled, textured, curvy.  Silk is long, slick and straight.
Compare this to the spinning videos of Judith MacKenzie that have deep insights for spinners of all levels of expertise.  If you want to know how to spin silk, consult Judith's work.  She has deep and extensive knowledge drawn from industry, academe, history and the rigors of her vast experience.  She shares the excitement of the possibilities of applying the skills and insights she passes along.
By contrast, Sara just goes on and on at the beginner level, boasting about all of the things she doesn't know. Her grim manner of presentation, like nun just about to cane a child, presents none of the joy and invitation of Judith's videos.  This is craft on the level of Velveeta cheese on Wonder bread passed off as gourmet cooking, where the fancy part is all the ways you can cut the sandwich.  Information on silk would have been easy to find to prepare for the video, but she passed along misinformation, silly hearsay and chatter about how she has done the same thing over and over for years, as if this made it better.
The frosty personality and anti-thinking would be okay if she had something beautiful to share, something inspiring, but her work is ghastly.  It is garish, pedestrian, wholly defeating the potentials of silk.
Judith MacKenzie, by comparison, spins to be able to make things more exquisite than could be acquired any other way, to enjoy the process, the materials, the intellectual, the tactile, the artistic (though her work is also rather ugly).  Sara Lamb spins to be able to say she made it herself and this is what her ego is built on.  Interweave uses people over and over again until their name is known and only a small percentage of them have anything to offer.  This video takes a great topic and does absolutely nothing with it.  If it were an elementary school project, I'd give the kid an A.  But for an adult, especially someone spinning for so many years, I give it one star.
If you are an absolute beginner, avoid it, because you will be setting up expectations, habits and ideas that will be of disservice to your development as a spinner.  If you have advanced knowledge, you will find this about as useful as sitting at a spinning guild meeting and having the lady next to you chatter on.",1452470400,5,3315,4.620102214650767
