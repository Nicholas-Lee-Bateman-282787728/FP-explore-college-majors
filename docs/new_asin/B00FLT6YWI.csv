6013876,4,B00FLT6YWI,"""Gloria"" (2013 release from Chile; 100 min.) brings the story of Gloria (played by Paulina Garcia), a fifty-something divorced woman. As the movie opens, we find Gloria in a dance club with Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" blasting away. Gloria is alone, but certainly not lonely. She loves to dance, and she attracts the attention of others. Pretty soon, Gloria makes the acquaintance of Rodolfo, a sixty-something who is also divorced, yet emotionally still close to his ex-wife and even more so his two grown daughters. Meanwhile, we get to also know Gloria's grown kids: her son Pedro is taking care of a new baby, and her daughter Ana is involved with her boyfriend from Sweden. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this is one great 'little' movie about the free-spirited Gloria. One can't help but marvel at the ""joie de vivre"" which Gloria lives by, even if things are not always easy or don't always go her way. Second, what can you say about the towering performance from Paulina Garcia in the title role! She is in virtually every frame of the movie, and she will blow you away. She brings a daring performance on every level. Co-star Sergio Hernandez as romantic interest Rodolfo is pretty good too. Beware: there are a number of nude scenes between these two, which may make uncomfortable viewing for some. I must say that I am surprised--and disappointed--that Paulina Garcia, who has won a number of international prizes for this performance (including ""Best Actress"" at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival, where this movie premiered), did not even get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Third, there are a couple of key scenes in the movie that will stay with you, none better in my opinion than the awkward family reunion on Pedro's birthday, with Gloria's ex-husband and his new wife, and Gloria introducing Rodolfo to her family for the first time. Just watch what happens. Last but not least: there is a ton of great music in the movie, including of course Umberto Tozzi's late 70s classic ""Gloria"" (Laura Branigan's cover version a few years later became a monster hit in the US).

This movie reminded me of the 1978 classic ""An Unmarried Woman"" starring Jill Clayburgh (I think she even won the Best Actress Oscar for this). Certainly these two movies are similar in spirit, if nothing else. ""Gloria"" opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and when I went to see it this weekend, the matinee screening was surprisingly well attended, which is great news. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie with stellar performances, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Gloria"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1393632000,28,2749,4.834394904458598

6013878,5,B00FLT6YWI,"Paulina Garca deserves all her awards and recognition for her portrayal of Gloria, a fiftysomething woman living alone whose grown children and dull job need a little of her attention, but not much. Her real life is at the nightclubs where she dances and flirts, drinks and dreams, and meets Rodolfo, a handsome but slightly fishy recent divorc, who shows her the best of good times but is constantly distracted by his former life. In some scenes Garca looks tired and even older than her years; in others she's lithe, stylish, sexy, radiant, aglow with vitality and her indefatigable faith in romance--even the riskiest of romances. As my father said after he saw it, ""All women are beautiful."" You'll want to have dinner with Gloria's conversationally and musically gifted friends, and you'll want to go out dancing with Gloria.",1393545600,12,830,4.9784172661870505

6013880,5,B00FLT6YWI,"What a wonderful movie. It just shows you that it's never to late to go out, to dance and to meet new men. Just keep the relationship ""light."" No sense in going overboard too soon.",1466985600,,180,4.171428571428572
6013881,1,B00FLT6YWI,"The previews were very misleading. If I wanted to see naked people having sex, there is free porn on the internet. The movie was slow and very boring. This is nothing of what we thought it would be. Now I have to sell this crap, or basically give away to get it out of my house.",1462838400,,278,3.982142857142857

6013884,4,B00FLT6YWI,"This movie captures a real life better than almost any other movie I've seen. Gloria is interesting enough and intelligent enough to engage anyone interested in a section of life of an older divorced woman who's not afraid to get out and meet men and enjoy their company. Her life is real and her reactions are real and I liked her, even if she's not a Hollywood beauty. I loved the ending where she's dancing by herself to the Spanish version of Gloria.",1459555200,,454,4.481927710843373

6013891,3,B00FLT6YWI,"On its surface this appealing little movie is a muted embrace-of-life tale in which the 50-something Gloria finds herself after floundering in the empty sea of a post-divorce empty-nest life from which a virile older lover, Rodolfo, seems to rescue her.  Unfortunately, Rodolfo turns out to be an inconstant lover, still emotionally attached to his family and divorced wife in seemingly strange ways that the blurb on the video back-cover mistakenly describes as his having a secret.

One great pleasure the movie provides is the opportunity to fathom and unravel this secret, which amounts to understanding the forces and passions that inform every important aspect of his behavior towards Gloria  from his initial odd but sincere profession of love found anew to his seemingly inexplicable desertions  and provide a remarkable and deeply consistent character study.  Gloria has no interest in understanding such matters  nor for that matter much of anything else  and the movie makes hay over her declaration of independence in the face of his bad behavior but its portrait of the heroine is hardly as interesting as its portrait of Rodolfo as counter-force.  Unfortunately, the movies undoing is that unless one can enthuse over a trite theme of feminist independence, neither character manages to pull one into caring very deeply what becomes of them.",1451260800,,1355,5.2407407407407405
6013892,4,B00FLT6YWI,"I found it funny and poignant but would have liked more of her family. The ending was  a bit trite with the song ""Gloria.""",1448323200,,122,4.083333333333333

6013894,1,B00FLT6YWI,Never really figured out the point of this movie.  It was slow and I kept hoping it would get better as we got farther into it.  That never happened.  Lots of nudity and sex but could have been more subtle considering the actors were middle aged (Gloria) and muuuuch older (him).,1440028800,,279,4.431372549019608

6013899,3,B00FLT6YWI,This movie is subtitled and concerns the search for romance by older people  A Little drawn out and with no real DRAMA  it was ok.  The performances were fine and the subject material refreshing in that for once we weren't being told old people shouldn't be having sex  but their relationship was treated as simply the war things are  no judgement.  No Violence car chases  it was ok,1437436800,,383,4.544117647058823

6013904,4,B00FLT6YWI,This was a very touching movie. The acting was real and I could feel it inside. This is when you know a movie is good. The English Subtitles is a bit of a distraction but the movie was worth seeing even with the distraction.,1434412800,,224,4.113636363636363

6013921,4,B00FLT6YWI,A sensitive well acted story (sub titled).  Plot and subplot make for an interesting and tormenting struggle between divorced individuals of different families.  A very serious look at relationships between adults who have past their prime.,1430611200,,240,5.638888888888889

6013925,4,B00FLT6YWI,"The stroy line and acting quickly put me in a comfortable chair. The lead Paulina Garcia, a Boomer by US standards did well in portraying
what we all go thru in late life. Much of the movie was just observing, like standing behind the tree peeking into someones life. I was not prepared for full frontal nudity, but it surely added the nakedness we have to go thru in relationshops. I highy recommend this one!",1429488000,,410,4.48

It had a quirky grittiness that reminds me of some of my favorite movies from the seventies. I am younger than Gloria but can relate to a woman trying to live life as her self and take some pleasure in it. Bravo.",1428105600,3,365,4.304347826086956

6014031,4,B00FLT6YWI,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS***  Absorbing, unique film about the trials and tribulations of a woman approaching 60.  Compelling action that speaks volumes, subtitles are scarcely needed.  Well worth watching, but I had some trouble getting past Gloria's heavy drinking.  Obviously, she'd be more likely to successfully navigate life (whether 20 or 60) without it.  She continually put herself in harm's way, and of course attracted men as damaged as she or merely cruising for a good time.  The ending, which bespoke of her independent spirit, was better than slinking back home and knitting a sweater, I suppose, but for me the big question mark of what the future held in the shadow of booze loomed large.  Even so, thought-provoking.

Raw, powerful sex scenes with full frontal nudity (Gloria had a semi-Brazilian bikini wax, that showed her mettle right there, LOL), and as another reviewer mentioned, desires, dating dramas, impulsive ""damn the consequences"" behavior and passions to rival any 20-something's.  Director Sebastin Lelio made daring, innovative choices as to shots and angles, and coupled with Paulina Garca's utterly naked, un-self-conscious acting produced something so intensely personal I felt like a voyeur; gifted film-making.  A character-driven drama, I definitely felt like I knew Gloria, and cared about her.  Great music too.  After watching this I tried to think of another film about an older woman coming to terms with life, successfully, but drew a blank.  I'd like a sequel, like to know what became of Gloria.",1421107200,,1538,5.305785123966942

6014034,4,B00FLT6YWI,"Gloria (Paulina Garcia) is a divorced fifty something year old. Her children are long grown up and she is very much young at heart. She goes out to clubs, dances etc. She is basically looking for love in Santiago. Then she meets an ex naval officer Rodolfo. He too is divorced and they hit it off straight away.

He is captivated by her lust for life and easy passion which seems to have been missing from his. Whilst she is quick to embrace him to the bosom of her family - he is rather more reluctant to allow her any where near his. Inequalities in any relationship will cause problems and so the scene is set.

This film is carried by Paulina Garcia's performance. She is a whirlwind and depicts the character of Gloria perfectly, a woman who drinks, smokes, loves and is let down. This is from director Sebastian Leilo who also brought us the rather good `La Sagrada Famila' in 2005. This is one for real fans of World cinema",1419897600,3,930,4.401162790697675

6014040,5,B00FLT6YWI,"This film is elegantly written, directed, and acted. It is also profoundly insightful as a bit of character analysis, with some surprises near the end and an upbeat finish. There's a subtlety of execution here that I tremendously admire!

Gloria is a woman of mediocre assets who has shed her alcoholic, abusive husband, dotes on her children, drinks too much, and hangs around in bars. One evening she is approached by a sort of middle-aged dream-boat who fits her desires to a 't' and seems much enamored of her. He wines and dines her, takes her places, beds her passionately, and is soon the center of her life. But there are a few problems: he is prone to unexplained absences and phone calls from his other family. Pretty soon, Gloria is mad enough to shoot him.

SPOILER ALERT!

Most reviewers take Gloria's beau at face value when he says he's divorced. He also says his daughters are in their twenties. Near the end of the film, it becomes clear that he still lives with his wife and his daughters, who are much younger than he said. Probably everything he said about himself was a lie. His initial approach to her makes a lot more sense when you recognize that he is looking for a vulnerable, middle-aged woman who won't make too many demands. The guy is a superb actor who seems to have fooled most of the critics as well as Gloria. She finds redemption at the end, shedding her clownish glasses and starting to dance like a real hot Latina. One hopes she has put her anger, her drinking, and her vulnerability behind her.",1414281600,4,1533,4.567272727272727

6014051,4,B00FLT6YWI,"The plot of Sebastian Lelio's film is straightforward: Gloria, a middle-aged divorcee (Paulina Garcia), visits a singles club, falls in love with Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez), and then discovers the truth about him.  After having been stood up twice, she takes her revenge on him and resolves to stand up to the world on her own.  What makes GLORIA such a memorable experience is the way it is shot: there are very few external sequences, suggesting that the characters are somehow prisoners of their natures.  Gloria's apartment appears particularly claustrophobic, the walls hemming her in both physically and emotionally.  Lelio's shooting-style reinforces the sense of imprisonment; through a series of tight close-ups on Gloria's side profile we get the feeling that she cannot escape her destiny.  Although fond of her children Pedro (Diego Fontecila) and Ana (Fabiola Zamora), she understands that she has little no influence in their lives anymore; with no family of her own, she does not have much to look forward to other than a life of emotional imprisonment.  Nonetheless the film ends on a note of qualified optimism; after having wrought a satisfying revenge on the spineless Rodolfo, Gloria goes on her own to a party, and sees a peacock spreading its plumage.  This is an important symbol, suggesting pride in one's appearance: Gloria stares as it and returns to the dance-hall, where she refuses yet another offer from a male consort to dance, and strikes out on her own.  The film ends with the song ""Gloria"" on the soundtrack, and an extended shot of her gyrating to the music, while spreading her arms peacock-style.  Although the daily grind of life might not have changed for her, she feels more confident in herself to take pride in what she has.  This is her passport to escape from the mental prison which hitherto has inhibited her.  With no music on the soundtrack, save for the sounds in the discos, singles clubs and hotels, Lelio's film is an intense experience, refusing to allow the audience the release of sentimentality.  Garcia's performance in the central role is little short of wondrous; it must have been difficult to sustain that level of intensity, especially with the camera so relentlessly focused on her profile.  All in all, a memorable cinematic experience.",1407456000,4,2301,5.03957783641161

6014056,4,B00FLT6YWI,"Paulina did a fantastic job portraying Gloria because she was so convincing. I feel most of us Americans are looking for a story that has an epiphany or an exact moment when the protagonist comes to a realization that..... or a life lesson. Well, all I can say is that movie is realistic. Life can be slow and yet so fast you close your eyes and it's nearly over. Many of us meet that unattainable or ambivalent person.... Is it real so uncommon or heart breaking we should never have a mature aged woman experience this in a movie? Why? Is it too sad? Reality isn't always  perfect. So I would have to say the movie did a good job showing that. I appreciate that it did not have any pretenses..... AND Paulina really was Gloria for the duration of the movie.  ALso, I would have to say the sex and nude scenes  shocked me a bit. However, I appreciate the way mature aged people are portrayed to have an enjoyable sex life. Good for them and great news for us in our upcoming years.",1404518400,4,982,4.297297297297297
6014057,1,B00FLT6YWI,"The previews of Gloria were deceptive. I thought this would be a movie about a woman who was recently divorced, and after a struggle would change her life around.  The movie showed a woman, divorced for several years, desperatly  searchingfor a man, any man, and finds one at a dance.  They become involved, and then break up.  She continues to look for a man who then abandons her on a beach.  At this point I lost all respect for her.  I had tried to like the character but now I really disliked her. In fact there was not one likable character in the movie. I had been waiting for her ""rebirth"" and it never happened.  The last scene shows Gloria dancing happily to the song Gloria by herself.  I think this was supposed to show that she was going to change.  It was too little, too late.",1404432000,4,791,4.326530612244898
6014058,4,B00FLT6YWI,"At 58, Gloria is in the midst of a midlife crisis. Divorced and with a seemingly strained relationship with her adult children, Gloria is also coping with a mundane job, a potentially psychotic upstairs neighbor, and days on end of perpetual loneliness (and, oh yes, a creepy hairless cat that keeps coming over for a visit). Until, that is, she meets Rodolpho, a divorced ex-naval officer, who has the opposite problem from Gloria: hes TOO intimately involved with the lives of his grown daughters, so much so that he is unable to devote the time needed to nurture his relationship with Gloria.

On the surface, Gloria feels like most of the other midlife crisis films weve seen, but the strength of this Chilean/Spanish co-production lies in its naturalism and in its focus on revelatory detail. Writer Gonzalo Maza and writer/director Sebastian Lelio provide enough specifics to make this a very particular story about a very particular woman. That manages to keep Gloria a sympathetic figure even when her understandable unhappiness begins to slide over into self-pity. The movie also refuses to tie its story up in a nice, neat little bow at the end to cater to audience expectations.

Paulina Garcia won a number of awards, all richly deserved, for her nuanced, fully-developed portrayal of a woman whose life is all but put under a microscope for all the world to see. Yet, Garcia meets the challenge with a bravery rare for actresses her age. Sergio Hernandez matches her as the man who comes into Glorias life but who may be bringing plenty of his own baggage right along with him.

Yet, for all its insight into late-in-life romance, the movie ultimately reveals that middle-aged lovers are often every bit as petulant, jealous and overly sensitive - not to mention, clueless - as the greenest teen when it comes to affairs of the heart. Some things just never change, I guess.",1404086400,21,1887,4.872274143302181

6014063,3,B00FLT6YWI,"The trailer and at least one of the reviews here make one expect a feel-good movie, but actually I found the movie to be a downer. Yes, the actress is incredible, and her character stays strong despite many mildly irritating and some very crappy things that happen to her. It's an interesting character study and the very last scene is super well done.
One person who reviewed this said that the translation was terrible, so I was looking for that. I lived in Chile many years and speak Spanish fluently, and I found the translation actually frankly better than average. There is only one part of the movie that is not translated, and that's when they play the bossa nova song guas de Maro, but that's in Portuguese. The song describes love and says something like, ""It's bread, it's stone, it's the end of the road"" and so forth, paralleling something that her romantic interest had read to her earlier in the movie. Otherwise, that person who felt that something was missing in the translation maybe just was imagining that the movie wasn't as slow as it actually was.",1402444800,,1070,4.666666666666667

6014068,2,B00FLT6YWI,"If I hadn't been stuck in an airport I would have stopped watching after the first 30 min. Maybe it's my lack of understanding of Chilean culture - that's a distinct possibility - but I can't imagine why the filmmaker thought this would be an interesting project. It was a glimpse into the lives of two wholly mediocre and unnecessarily unnatractive people in their search for love and excitement and a way out of their tedious, predictable lives. Ironically, this search leads them into a relationship that is utterly tedious and predictable. He's the proverbial man who wants out of his first relationship but his personality is insipid and lackluster and he doesn't have the strength of character to set down boundaries with his ex (or maybe current) wife and adult children, who also can't create independent lives of their own. She's just a hot mess. And please with those glasses. This is what being stuck in LAX for 3 hours makes you do. Otherwise an entire waste of time.

I thought it was well done and brought an added depth and richness to the character and what she and her life are like, what she's going through, trying to find herself, be herself, as a now single ""woman of a certain age."" I do love the end, that she comes back to herself and realizes she can live and embrace life in full joy without a man.

6014077,5,B00FLT6YWI,"This is not a movie for those who like pat stories replete with constant witticisms, action and (obvious) plot lines (like most movies made these days). This is a movie about how a woman in her fifties is managing a transition: dealing with life post divorce, with the necessary separation that occurs when the (grown) children indeed become independent and make lives quite apart from your own, with finding joy and love at an age some throw in the towel. There are so many great scenes in this movie and such poignant moments. The music, too, was fabulous. I began by feeling sorry for Gloria and ended up feeling impressed. Her relationships, with Rodolfo, her kids, her housekeeper, her loopholes neighbor, even her ex and his new wife, all show how Gloria is coping and working out how to be in this phase of her life. I thought it was a beautiful film. If you think only hard-bodied young people should be seen naked, if you have issues with older people engaging in sex, maybe give this a pass (and grow up?): I applaud the film for showing that older people are sexually active. If you don't speak/understand Spanish or if you are one who doesn't like subtitles, you will find this film tedious...but still, consider reserving judgement and see Gloria.

The lead actress Paulina Garcia won a Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival, and richly deserved it. It was also nice to see the great hit song 'Gloria' re-surface as the theme music of the film. I am very partial to Latin American films, and this one did not disappoint.
