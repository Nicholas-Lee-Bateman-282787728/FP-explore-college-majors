8189246,3,B000P6R6LA,"If you don't know anything about Woolf, and just want a brief sketch of her life, then this film is fine. If you want an indepth, accurate biography, ""Famous Authors Series"" will disapoint every time. History Channel, National Geographic,  and Nova are a little better than Famous Authors. PBS and Biography are much better. PBS is really the best.",1359331200,,348,4.898305084745763
8189247,4,B000P6R6LA,"A concise and informative summary of the life of a literary genius, even if the presentation is rather pedestrian.  The overall film quality is slightly grainy and pasty, but it is nevertheless interesting to see so many photographs of Woolf and her family.",1336176000,,257,4.976744186046512
