7922820,5,B00004TJJR,"Excellent, thought-provoking movie with a wonderful cast. Sidney Poitier is excellent, as usual, and his real-life daughter is a very good actress ! We show this film to our college psychology classes to open a discussion on poverty, mentoring, and characteristics of a successful person. We highly recommend it.",1429920000,,312,5.387755102040816

7922823,5,B00004TJJR,"This is a movie that exposes some of the very traits that hender our progress as a people. One of them being fear. It also exposes some of the traits that will help us to rise and be more productive as a people. Like courage, determination, and perseverance. This movie needs to be upgraded and put on DVD.",1345248000,3,306,4.293103448275862
7922824,5,B00004TJJR,"Love this movie.  Sidney is his professorial self.  His daughter does a pretty good job playing a
girl from the projects who wants to free herself and have a better life.  There are so many Edens
all over this country that it is good to see a movie that shows a child ""escaping"" from her
surroundings.  You don't see much of this.  We get to see the drive by shootings and the victims
of ""snitching"" (which in our day we called showing integrity and protecting people),and the baby daddies
and mamas.  We know there are better things going on, but in the media what bleeds leads.",1272326400,2,579,4.415094339622642
7922825,5,B00004TJJR,"This movie first caught my eye in a video rental store. And after watching it, I was overwhelmed, especially with Sidney Poitier being the sensational actor that He is. Of course I had to add this one to collection. The story is very heartfelt and inspiring. Not only does it is express the importance of a quality education and the opportunity it presents, but also the importance of being a mentor. This is an exceptional movie about overcoming seemingly impossible situations,forgiveness, and moving forward in life. Hopefully this film will be released on DVD soon. I also recommend another great film starring Mr Poitier: The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn. It's a must-see!!!",1164758400,4,679,5.017699115044247
