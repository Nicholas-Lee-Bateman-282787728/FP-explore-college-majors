4375693,5,B004HGXL9U,I purchased this set for my son as a Christmas gift. It arrived in excellent condition within the delivery period. He is a guitarist and conducted thorough research prior to selecting this set and has been very pleased with it.,1392681600,,227,4.7
4375694,4,B004HGXL9U,"The three dvd set is about ten hours long...disk one is a bit basic covering areas you may find it redundant if you have experience but great if your looking to start in the engineering.  Disk two is much more advanced and gives you great insight into Alan's view of working (definitely a bit different).  The great part is he has tons of interviews with producer/engineers (Puig, Sheiner, McBride, Ainsley etc.) so you get every opinion and how they work- and there is no agreement!  It does let you find the people whose sound you like and find their ideas and albums to reference.  In addition he goes through his personal historical experience from the Beatles and Pink Floyd to his own projects.  Then there are great interviews with various musicians from Michael McDonald to Erica Baydu and their techniques.  I seriously took notes to refernce later.  Through disk three he records from scratch a new song with Simon Phillips on drums (the Who , Toto), Nathan East on Bass (Eric Clapton and everyone else), Session guitarist Tim Pierce (everyone), as well as Keys by Rami Joffe (sp?) again another session guy.  They all offer great insight to recording in muliple interviews.  The entire dvd set is done with clear and often humorous asides wth narration by Billy Bob Thornton.  As a former studio owner I still found info for my home set up and new ideas- expensive but worth the investment.  The only failing is the website is not yet up to snuff as mentioned in the dvds; I am sue this will be corrected in time. in addition, a bit more focus on gear recommendations itself, as opposed to usage would help most people get a clearer view.  I imagine as the website gets going this will be covered.  All in all an enjoyable experience and when the site is rolling I say you'll have a five star package here.",1387843200,3,1817,4.605590062111801
4375695,5,B004HGXL9U,"Alan has produced a superb training program for Sound Engineer Wannabe's. He speaks from personal experience, and gives many examples of 'how to' do things that are priceless. Well worth every penny!!",1365033600,,200,5.28125
4375696,5,B004HGXL9U,"I thought they did  a great jobe organizing the subject matter, and for someone who wants to learn more about the tools, and the approaches, and the subjectivity of those approaches, this video covers most all of the areas. I believe there is a companion 'book/guide"" coming in roughly May, so, that hopefully will offer the detailed exercises that will take the propspective engineer/producer learn through hands on!",1357862400,2,417,5.132352941176471
4375697,5,B004HGXL9U,"I am an amature musician. I am also a fan of the Alan Parsons Project. This set is very informational about all aspects of recording bands and instruments. It gives you an understandings of the how's and why's of the whole process. Being an amature, It was nice to get an understanding of how Compressors, Limitors, Preamps, Parametric EQ's, etc.. work. I recomment this product for anyone that wants a real understanding of how to record!",1338854400,10,439,4.7894736842105265
4375698,5,B004HGXL9U,I purchased this for my eighteen year old  grandson and he loves it! It covers the recording industry in great depth and detail.,1335744000,3,128,4.565217391304348
4375699,5,B004HGXL9U,"surely Alan Parsons is to the record industry what Einstein was to physics. These videos take the viewer through the process of recording, mixing, and a small snippet of mastering a song.  Alan gives you interviews with some heavy hitters in the music business...producers and artists alike. Now...if you are thinking that one will learn all the long kept secrets of which gear to use, discover some ""sacred truth"" that will instantly propel you into instant stardom...THINK DIFFERENTLY!!! The music business just doesn't work that way...what you will walk away with is some no nonsense approaches to sound recording by the people who have done it for decades. Alan does speak to some of the ""prejudices"" and does so in a tongue and cheek fashion. These videos were well thought out in production and tastefully executed. For me watching them was like being there in the studio...or reading a good book that you just can't put down. if your passion is music whether you do it for a living, or just a hobbyist, or maybe just
starting out...you will enjoy learning from these videos. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!! KUDOS ALAN!!!!!

4375700,4,B004HGXL9U,"As a novice in sound recording, I have been searching for resources that can deepen my understanding on both live and studio recording without first having to invest much money and time attending classes.  This set of instructional DVDs by Alan Parson did the job.  Topics dealing with sound reinforcement in various settings and recording basics were adequately explained and within grasp of a non-professional.  Almost immediately, I could adapt a few ideas in my home studio setup. On this note, it would be wonderful if there could be a chapter dedicated to issues relevant to home recording studios.  On the whole, this is a worthwhile investment.",1319414400,6,652,5.065420560747664
4375701,5,B004HGXL9U,"Listening to Alan Parsons now for about 25 years. Started with Tales of Mystery and Imagination. And a lot of Alan's music is on my favorite list. Never really known why I like it, it just always sounds so good!

After doing a professional photo-shoot session with Rolando Gomez it was an eye opener of what a professional sees in photographing. Seeing the DVD of Alan a month later at amazon was wondering me if he could do the same for me with music. And he really did!

Listening to music will never be the same anymore, at least for me ;-)

A professional way of explaining where music really comes from. And I would almost say a must have for everybody who wants to go a little bit further than just listening, but also wants to understand what happens in the background of really great music. Without the need to become an expert like Alan.

Alan, great job ! Thanks !",1312329600,11,874,4.3765432098765435
4375702,4,B004HGXL9U,"149 seemed like a lot for this DVD set until I watched it. Simply tons of well-explained tips and tricks for recording and producing music. A who's who of studio pros talking about mixing, EQ and the like. Seriously, if you know what a DAW is and have one or want one, this DVD is a must have. Cheaper than going to a recording school, and more convenient by far.",1297728000,15,363,4.2
8429518,5,B004HGXL9U,It was a fun watch and I'm sure that I will watch it many times.,1451174400,,64,3.3333333333333335
8429519,4,B004HGXL9U,"I have owned Alan Parsons Presents Art And Science of Sound for about a year now.  On the first pass I gave in to the temptation to blow right through it and found it quite enjoyable and a good source of general information on a number of topics.  I have watched it several times since and have found the information well worth the investment. It breaks the production process into a number of chapters generally 10-40 minutes in length.  Although most of the information is rather high level, there are a number of useful and detailed tips throughout. I found the segments on drum and guitar recording especially rich in these areas. Lots of misc tips and tricks scattered thru. This will not replace detailed reading and experience on the topics covered but provides an excellent starting point and strong foundation.

As for negatives, the oft referred to web site has been all but abandoned  - which is a shame because it could otherwise be the seed for a great community. Also, there is a fair amount of reuse of interview footage.  Granted the same comments may apply in multiple contexts - but I would have rather see the time filled with other material.

All in all I think this is a really good set for the beginning to immediate level recordist and should provide a lot of good jumping off points for more advanced learning.  This is probably best suited for home studio folks and other looking to start on their path into recording and engineering.  Its also not a bad for musicians who will be going into a studio for the first time.  Given the choice - I would buy it again....",1440633600,2,1590,4.566901408450704

8429521,4,B004HGXL9U,"Good advices (chapter 9 on are good to keep like a video-consult)

BUT the packaging is cheap as hell!!

Is a plain cardbord box with a cardboard accordion that has tray-like plastic holding de 3 DVDs.
Also the printing on the DVDs looks crappy",1430092800,,244,4.5227272727272725
8429522,5,B004HGXL9U,"This is a review of ""Alan Parsons' Art & Science of Sound Recording"" by Alan Parsons and Julian Colbeck. This three-DVD set systematically covers the basics of nearly every aspect of music recording. Alan Parsons is, of course, one of the very best recording engineers and producers ever (just perform a Google search). I thank him for making these DVDs; I learned quite a lot. I was initially put off by the relatively high price of this set; but I think it is well worth the money to have Alan Parsons (the man himself) gift us with his years of recording experience.

If you cannot find a hands-on training program where you live, and you cannot get an internship at some recording studio, then this DVD set may be your best choice of being exposed to the topics you will eventually need to learn. After you finish this DVD set, at least you will understand enough to find books, websites, and vendor specifications that provide you with the greater detail you might want.

This DVD set is for (1) folks who just want to know what those wizards do in the recording studio; and (2) folks who want to perform their own recording and/or mixing. If you aspire to be your own recording engineer, I think this DVD set will help you no matter what your budget may (or may not) be. Obviously, you will get better recordings (and get more use out of this DVD set) if you have a few thousand dollars to spend on equipment and room modifications.

This DVD set contains 24 segments collectively providing nearly 10 hours of instruction:
1. A brief history of recording (10 minutes)
2. Studio acoustics (17 minutes)
3. Microphones (35 minutes)
4. Consoles & controllers (38 minutes)
5. Digital audio & computers (36 minutes)
6. Monitoring (26 minutes)
7. MIDI (20 minutes)
8. EQ (37 minutes)
9. Compressors & limiters (31 minutes)
10. Noise gates (22 minutes)
11. Reverb (22 minutes)
12. Delays (18 minutes)
13. A band tracking (i.e., recording) session (22 minutes)
14. Vocals (47 minutes)
15. Internet recording (15 minutes)
16. Drums (25 minutes)
17. Keyboards (28 minutes)
18. Bass (21 minutes)
19. Guitar (42 minutes)
20. Recording acoustic guitar with vocals (6 minutes)
21. Recording a choir (12 minutes)
22. Approaches to live recording (10 minutes)
23. Mixing (49 minutes)
24. Dealing with disasters (15 minutes)

There is quite a lot of information in each segment; I watched most of them several times each.

There is also a book associated with this project; you can find it on Amazon.

Cons:
Just one: the packaging. The three DVDs and the tiny booklet come in a HUGE cardboard box that is almost all empty volume. I have other three-DVD sets that came in boxes about one-fourth the size.",1421712000,4,2692,4.717021276595744
