8669681,5,B00M1CFSHK,"Under Wraps is a lovely cartoon horror story for the kids to watch on Halloween. It is just scary enough to acceptable and allows the smallest viewers to experience a ""scary movie"". An archaeologist and his family return from a dig with a surprise mummy. There is lots of adventure as they try to return the mummy to its sarcophagus. Great entertainment.",1516838400,,354,4.725806451612903

8669684,3,B00M1CFSHK,"When a movie goes for just 44 minutes, it needs to be really good to be value for money.  Unfortunately Under Wraps has very basic 3D style animation, it certainly lacks the detail of Toy Story, Over the Hedge, Shrek, well most animated movies made since this century began.  The storyline is pretty basic and lacks jokes to keep viewers amused. Basically the plot revolves around a klutzy kid walking in the main entrance of a pyramid that his archaeologist parents are exploring who have refused to let him accompany them.  Somehow missed by them is a pharo's coffin and wooden bridge, that the boy falls through, ending up at another coffin, this time with a necklace, which he decides to steal.  Of course stealing stuff from a pyramid is never a good idea if you don't want to be cursed.  Back in the states the parents become mummified and it's up to the kid and his older sister who don't really get along to team up and save their parents from an Egyptian visitor wrapped in bandages, and some dimwitted cops who could stop them saving their parents in time.

Under Wraps is pretty much storyline and visual wise the quality of an episode of a Saturday morning cartoon.  It's completely forgettable once you've seen in and has no scenes or lines that are clever or witty enough that you'll want to remember after watching.",1447977600,,1330,4.610169491525424

8669688,5,B00M1CFSHK,"A lot of good Halloween fun for the whole family that's not too scary. On a trip to Egypt with his archeologist parents, a little boy unleashes an ancient curse that follows them all the way back to America. Now both the boy and his older sister must work together for the first time ever to stop the curse and return his parents back to normal before sundown. If you have little kids it's a lot of thrills and not too scary.",1417478400,3,425,4.195121951219512

8669690,4,B00M1CFSHK,"Very tame mummy movie set right around Halloween time.  Even the ""scariest"" scenes are quite mild and with an edge of humor (probably 6 years and up would be okay).  Story: two children follow their parents to an archeological dig in Egypt.  The younger boy is incredibly clumsy and wants to be there, the older sister is tech obsessed and does not.  The boy stumbles his way into an area of the pyramid he shouldn't be and unwittingly releases a curse upon his parents that manifests once they return home.  The children must work together to break the curse before it is too late for their parents.  The siblings are chased by two stereotypical police and a giant mummy that manages to find them after they return home from Egypt.  The uncomplicated plot is safe for younger children yet entertaining enough to hold the attention of older siblings and adults; the entire light story is laced with humor and voiced by some actors you will recognize (Brooke Shields, Matt Lillard, Drake Bell).  The one downside is the approximately 45 minute run time.",1414454400,5,1052,4.741758241758242
