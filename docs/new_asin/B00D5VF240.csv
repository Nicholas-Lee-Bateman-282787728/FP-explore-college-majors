8589771,2,B00D5VF240,"Frank (Daniel Bonjour) lives the American dream as a strip club owner and cocaine dealer. He has an innocent white bread girlfriend Ashley (Cinthya Bornacelli) who attends college and stays separate from his work. Frank has a partner Eddie (Gianni Capaldi) and Frank desires to take his operation to the next level where he works for Vincent (Vinnie Jones). Unfortunately his crimes do not go unnoticed. He is being followed by DEA agent Maxwell (Dolph Lundgren) and associates. A dirty doughnut eating cop (Randy Couture) is added to the mix.

The plot lacks depth and complexity. This is a straight forward crime/drama/thriller/action film. The talents of Dolph Lundgren are under utilized. Oh wait he does rough up a guy for information...only to brush him off and let him go. We needed Dolph for this? They could have used Betty White.

The sound track was pretty decent and of course Vinnie Jones does a good job in his limited role. The main problem with this feature was that Frank, the main character, was not someone we could root for. About 1/3 of the way through the film he gives a useless narration on the drug industry and the economy which never really ties into the film.

A lower tier rental. Dolph fans can skip this one and not miss anything. Also released under the title ""Ambushed.""
