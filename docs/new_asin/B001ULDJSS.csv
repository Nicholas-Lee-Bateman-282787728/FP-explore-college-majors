8344269,2,B001ULDJSS,This would look like something you would see on the Sci-Fi Channel. Its a 2 DVD set in the first one there are 3 episodes even has a mini interview with Former WWE Diva Shelly Martinez. Disc 2 have 3 episodes aswell with a few extras. For DVD you would expect more. Its a better fit for tV than DVD,1291939200,,298,3.9833333333333334
