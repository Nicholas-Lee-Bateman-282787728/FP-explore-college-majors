3415965,5,B0018CWW96,"Starship Troopers

Earth is at War with an Alien race of Bugs Bent on Destroying all of Humanity. The men and woman of the Mobile Infantry are the Only Defense against this growing Treat. Join Johnny Rico From boot camp all the way to Leader of a Platoon. Based on the Robert A Heinlein Novel, starship troopers takes away the books technology for political satire and the face of war. Instead of Jump Suits and a few Heavy armed and Heavily trained soldiers the MI is made up of Countless Grunts sent into battle as ""Fresh Meat for the Grinder"". It has spawned one of the largest Fan bases in Movie history.

Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation

Most people did not like the sequal to Starship Troopers but i think it really makes sense, i mean, the bugs fight on the frontlines but that leaves no room for sabitage or spies therefore a new type of bug had to be invented. The story would get boring with nothing but mindless bugs working for a few movement deficiant bugs and the humans having advanced technology . sure the first one rocked but wouldnet they try to creat spies it only makes since and besides the writter of the first also wrote this pone there for its officialy tied in to the upcoming third film. I also like the new guns. weapons change after years of war and advanced therefore projectile weapones give way to energy rifles of more caliber. I enjoyed the filom and believe it makes perfect since in such a war.

Starship Troopers 3: Marauder

The second and Final Sequal to Starship Troopers. Johnny Rico is called backl into action to save the leader of humanity from the bug hordes. Now a colonel. Rico must race time to rescue the sky marshel before his troops are over-run. Little Known to most movie fans, this sequal has been followed very closely by countless fans around the world. It will be Released Direct to DVD in the United States and will have a theater Premier in Spain and Japan. The film lacks in many ways but still maintains an entertaining thrill-ride. Marauder also enters Religion into the Starship Universe and its role in the events. The most gigantic of enterence is the King or Hive Bug. The main bug. Which encompasses half a planet!

Features: all the Discs come with a Digital copy for you Ipod or computer and each DVD has a Making-Of and ST2 and ST3 both have production featurettes. They also redid the original films DVD to add a new menu and clearer sound and picture.",1212451200,10,2435,4.5227272727272725

3416088,4,B0018CWW96,"Well, you know how it is...I saw the first movie, loved it and got interested in the rest of the , erm, <i>trilogy</i>......
Forgive the term, it's meant sarcastically.
As we all know, the first movie is great - despite having little if anything to do with Robert A. Heinlein's original book - the second movie is your typical sequel, meaning it sux, this particular one is kinda trying to be an 'Alien' type space horror movie, but the only thing it succeeds in is being...dark.
Literally.
Saves on special effects, i suppose.
Movie no. 3 is slightly better simply because they managed to re-recruit Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), but otherwise suffers from many of the typical politically correct syndromes that movies of our time suffer from.
Recommendation: Buy the most extensive Collector's Edition of the first movie your budget allows, forget the other 2 even exist.",1497312000,,874,4.912162162162162

But on a re watch, with its two sequels it stands up pretty well on its own as a straight sci-fi action piece, and an examination of fascism - and I can still read the Robert A.

As far as the movies go:
The first is great. Its corny and awesome at the same time and its not some low budget straight to DVD but actual effort and money was put into the graphics so its worth it. The second and third movies are those low budget straight to DVD movies but they aren't half bad.

The third is better, but you could just as easily buy and watch the first film and leave it at that.

3416431,5,B0018CWW96,"To celebrate my first review on Amazon, I think I will write one on my favorite movie of all time. This is for the blu ray bundle that includes all 3 movies at a price that one regular blu ray costs. Obviously a no brainer for me!

Lets start with the packaging, the box has some pretty awesome artwork on it and the blu rays are fit snugly into the case, it is a great way to show off your Starship Trooper dedication!

Now onto the movies themselves which is what everyone is here for:

Starship Troopers (1997)  This movie came out when I was in middle school and after seeing the preview, I knew immediately that I had to watch in the theaters. The whole concept appealed to me and shortly after, Blizzard made Starcraft which was pretty much what Starship Troopers was minus the Protoss. For those uninitiated, this movie takes place in the future where there is only one government called the Federation which unites the entire world. The only way to have kids, go to a good school, etc is to become a citizen which requires Federal service in the military fighting an ever long war against the bugs. The main character, Johnny Rico decides to join up with his girlfriend not knowing what he is in for. The movie tells a tale from when he is a fresh recruit and climbing the ranks, eventually becoming a squad leader himself.

Starship Troopers 2 (2004)  I was surprised they made a sequel to the original movie since I think it didn't need one because it was such a masterpiece but they did anyway but directly released to DVD. From the get go you can tell that this movie is extremely low budget since it only takes place on one planet in one location. The scope is definitely more focused on a squad trying to survive the onslaught of the bug invasion but if you can get past the terrible CG and the bad acting, the story is actually very grim and shows you why the war against the bugs is such an important one. The lack of having any memorable characters makes this film the weakest out of the three.

Starship Troopers 3 (2008)  I believe this movie to be a true sequel to the first one since no Starship Trooper movie is complete without Johnny Rico aka Casper Van Dien! This movie starts off in the new future after the first movie and shows the events that have been happening. There is a new sky marshal and he is physic and somehow gets tricked by a mother brain bug into sabotaging a base to prove his devotion to try and seek peace with the bugs. This film is also very low budget and must be watched with a grain of salt, however it was still better than the second film in terms of acting. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that it seems to almost be border line a propaganda movie to get you into religion.  The constant talk about having faith and having a guardian angel watching over you is repeated throughout the movie. At the end they show no shame into making religion acceptable as part of the daily life and I cant help but wonder how the screenplay got the greenlight. Overall, still enjoyable and a must watch if you are a Starship Trooper fan.

So what are you waiting for? Grab this copy now and you too can join the mobile infantry and save the world! Come on you apes, wanna live forever?!",1426464000,,3248,4.336079077429983

3416461,3,B0018CWW96,"Starship troopers blu ray trilogy purchased for 12 dollars. The picture quality is ok its not exactly what i expected for a blu ray but maybe thats just as good as it gets. The first film (which is the main reason i purchased this set) did not work on my sony blu ray player, and after some research it turns out that because of the ""BD LIVE"" feature some form of ""external memmory is required via a usb memmory stick on an SD card if your player has a slot for it. So i had a very usb memmory stick with only 256 mb on it which is almost nothing. But i put it in the usb slot and the film loaded up just fine so now i am happy with this purchase! So just a word of caution for an otherwise great deal on 3 cool sci fi films. If your blu ray player does not have enough internal memmory you may have to plug in some sort of external memmory source to your player to make the first film in the series work. Good luck!

Also the Set is on three separate discs, but they are slim so its not too much shelf space.

Starship Troopers:

Ok I will get through my beef quickly and we will move onto what you want to know.  This film portrays the military training a lot more callously than the book.  Here they are mean to be mean.  In the book they were tough but they cared. Plus the news reel stuff was just annoying.  I am sure the kids stepping on cockroaches was some kind of political statement but I didn't understand it.  Actually I think all the news real stuff was some kind of statement. (Again I am not sure what the director was trying to say) Also as its a movie and not a book or TV series there is a huge loss of character development, plus the idiot producers need a love interest.  Just can't tell a story without some kind of sexual tension.  Ok off the soapbox.  I am sure they could have screwed this movie up more.  I am just not sure how.  Zombies maybe?

Starship Troopers 3: Marauder

Well at least this has some special features.  A lot has been made in other reviews about the returning cast.  I believe the only guy to do both movies is Casper Van Dien (Johnny Rico).  While it is nice to have him back I wish we had a few more.  On the bad side this is at best a B movie.  Special Effects are a little off and the story is a little off.  Enjoyable movie but I found the special effects took away from the story.

Ok onto what you want to know.  As usual I am sure you have already read the plot so I will skip that. This offering has one disk containing the movie and the special features which include;

Set in the future it's a war pitting mankind against insects that can rapidly evolve, the base storyline has a lot to recommend it.

I'd rate the three movies as follows, averaging across the set.

Acting 3/5
Sets 3/5
Storylines 3.5/5
Beleivability 3/5
Satire 4/5
Special effects 4/5

To get the best from these DVD's I'd imagine a big screen and good audio package would go a long way to enhancing the experience.

If you enjoy Sci-Fi it's probably worth the investment at the under $10 price tag, you'd be hard put to rent them for that.",1334966400,2,676,4.647058823529412

Starship troopers which has nothing to do with the series pretty much at all besides that they used the same bugs, lets not mention that actors from the original starring in new roles as new people.  The third which was showing promise as they brought back original cast members was a catastrophe that turned into a religious propaganda feature film.  Bottom line:  Do yourself a favor and buy the first DVD outright and spare yourself the agony of having to watch the other two films which ruin the series entirely.",1325030400,,758,4.626865671641791

When I received the movies I watched them.  I really was impressed on how they portrayed the future and how we lived as human beings.  They were all positive and kept their chins up.,1317859200,,347,4.044117647058823
3416721,3,B0018CWW96,"This three pack of Starship Troopers gives the buyer all three of the franchises titles in one bundle. Each movie is in a nice slim pack and loaded with extras. As DVD releases go it gets top honours but as a consistent quality movie franchise,it just doesn't rate all that well.
Starship Troopers(released Nov/97) is the first and best of the Troopers series and stars Casper Van Dien as Johnny Rico. Military service guarantees citizenship in this futuristic tale. Johnny's girlfriend decides to join up for service as does Johnny alongside. Both want to help win the war against the arachnid threat from a faraway planet called Klendathu. His girlfriend gets a pilots commission while Johnny's scores get him a place as a grunt in the army.
The movie chronicles Johnny's training,his dismissal,his reinstatement and deployment to Klendathu. On the planet casualties abound and Johnny himself comes close many a time to dying. The arachnids however seem not to be just mindless insects as all were lead to believe. In fact Earth intelligence feels there is a brain bug behind all the insects actions and want one captured. When Johnny's girlfriend,now a certified pilot,crash lands on the planet Johnny and his men go after her. A brain bug comes out of hiding to kill his girlfriend but Johnny arrives in the nick of time to save her. Back on the surface they find that Johnny's old drill instructor on Earth has captured the brain bug and which is sure to make a difference in the bug fight.
The movie works on two levels. First,its an all out testosterone filled guy-romp that could be used as an army recruitment tool today. C'mon,go out and kill the enemy;in this case a bug. Secondly,it also works as an ANTI-war film. The films ESP squad looks like neat Nazis and the war propaganda used and the lengths they will go to to incite the population against the enemy,could be interpreted as the State out of control. Furthermore the endless and mindless violence perpetrated on Klendathu is something else to behold. A well done flick that seems to""wink"" at you from time to time,I give it a four star rating.
Starship Troopers 2(released June/04)stars Richard Burgi as Capt. Dax. Dax is a prisoner in a remote station outpost in the Klendathu system. His squad has been wiped out by the bugs and he is alone there with no guards,until a fresh military squad from Earth arrives to take over the station. Along the way the group is attacked and the rest proceed to their objective. Once they reach the station they find Dax but keep him locked up until they can get the power up and rescued. A general(Ed Lauter)and two grunts left behind to fight the bugs and having survived,show up later at the station. Once rejoined with the rest,strange things start to happen. Eventually it is learned that the bugs have implanted controlling creatures inside the bodies of the three survivors and one by one they are taking over the entire station. Dax,having been released by the general,is now one of a few who now battle back to fight this internal menace. At the last he and one survivor are alone on the roof when a rescue ship comes. Dax stays behind to his inevitable fate while the other leaves. Back home Dax is made out to be a hero and turns into another recruiting promotion.
This movie is certainly a step down from the first. The writers have lost their imagination as they use the old ""control bug"" chestnut for their plot. Not only that,as if the words ""The Federation"" isn't used as the name for the Earth forces alliance here,they also use the name""Dax"".Any Trekker out there worth his or her salt will know these Star Trek references without any reservations. The film isn't bad it just could be any Sci-Fi movie made in the last 35 years;they just tagged it with the name Starship Troopers,is all. I give this movie three stars.
Starship Troopers 3(released August/08-direct to DVD)is the worst of the bunch. Casper Van Dien as Colonel Johnny Rico is back,at least for the first part of the movie,then the last,as he leads troopers to an agrarian planet Roku San,where the bugs have infiltrated. They battle the bugs as usual but Johnny ends up hitting an old general friend in an argument and he also is set for execution by hanging. Johnny's rope breaks(on purpose) as his friend has a secret mission for him. The mission entails going to rescue a group of military personnel,including a high profile Sky Marshall by the name of Onake,stranded on planet OM-1. This forlorn group of individuals are dogged by bugs all the way to their destination,two or three finding God along the way. It seems the Sky Marshall KNOWS God,but not the Christian one. His is a giant brain bug,never seen before,who the Sky Marshall is enamoured with and wants to join with in order for the two species to know each other better and become one. The giant bug arrives but just seeks instant absorption into the collective. The Sky Marshall gets his wish but the others are at the last rescued by Rico's elite team of armoured exo skeletons(Marauders)designed for maximum bug damage. They wipe out the threat and head with the survivors back home. Rico is given command of the Marauder program, religion is now adopted and made an official part of the Federation code and Onake's story is turned into a hero's send off.
As I said this is the worst of the bunch. Van Dien is back for the first part of the movie while the group stranded on the planet is the next focus,then Van Dien returns to save the stranded personnel. The makers were hoping his appearance would save this movie but the plot/layout of the film kills any hope of that ever happening. The ""finding God"" thing just does not go over well and really is the sinker of this stinker. Two stars for this baby.
Technically all films have been remastered well and appear in their original widescreen a/r's. Each disc is loaded with plenty of featurettes,trailers,and galleries to satisfy the least interested Starship Troopers fan.
That is why I would give the package as a set,a high-five stars,but the movies...well,that is another story. The best I can give is a three star. Starship Troopers should have been an only child. But instead it just had two ugly step sisters!",1310428800,,6228,4.730450781968721

3416744,4,B0018CWW96,"The first movie just rocks and is alot of fun, it's man versus the big bugs but the whole thing is a movie popcorn at it's best. Even though story wise the humans probably started the 'war' it's really doesn't matter because it's just meant to be a action flick. On blu ray it looks great too, the next two are made to video efforts and the second one is only available in this package which is why I bought it. The second one is taking place in the mythology of the first but doesn't feature any of the characters of the first movie. It's still a decent low budget flick on it's own but compared to the first it's very much a lower budget affair. The third features some of the characters of the first and isn't as limited in storywise as the second which takes place mainly in one location. the third is better and features a higher budget which helps but it's still no a budget flick.
The blu rays look pretty good although the price is high. I bought this at ultimate electronics which is going out of business sadly for alot less.

The troops are all good looking (particularly Denise Richards!) and the officers are dressed like Nazis. Best of all, throughout the film, the narration employs a series of 1930s-style newsreels with propaganda clips and infomercials. It's a great study in contrasts. Of course, it's not really clear why they don't just rely on aerial bombardments and nukes (after all, the U.S. does) but I guess that wouldn't make for a good movie.

3416749,4,B0018CWW96,"I bought the box set because the cost was lower than buying the disks individually.  I have always loved the first Starship Troopers.  It has a little bit of everything -- science fiction, humour, action and adventure, and a little bit of romance.  It has a good cast, and the acting is well done.  Individually I give it a five.

I really don't care for number two.  It has nothing to do with the other two movies, and it has an entirely different cast of lesser known actors.  I suppose it is good enough if you like that sort of thing, but essentially it is just a gore-fest.  It is obvious from the very beginning that nobody will survive -- and they don't.  It's a very depressing film.  I only give this film a one.

The third Starship Troopers is much better than the second, but not as good as the first.  The original cast is back, and an effort is made to pick up the storyline, but, as with many sequels, it falls short of its promise.  It is mostly appropriate for someone who is fanatical about the series.  I give this one a three or four, making the average for the set a four.",1272672000,,1092,4.237864077669903

(Thank you, Amazon!)  Well, when we got the replacement, disc 1 still wouldn't work.  That's when I got on Amazon and saw the previous review stating that someone else had a problem with disc 1 and their Panasonic player.

So I did some research online at Blu-ray.com and found someone there with the same problem.  Fortunately for us, someone had figured out the solution to our problem.  For some unspecified reason, disc 1 needs to write to memory in order to boot up.  And some Panasonic players do not contain internal memory.  So they will not boot up correctly.  But, if you put an SD memory card in the SD memory card slot, the disc will write to that and it will boot up just fine.

We went out this morning and got a memory card and came home and, what do you know, they were right!  It does work.  So I wanted to get onto Amazon and let everyone know how to fix this little problem if you also happen to have a Panasonic player and couldn't get this disc to work on your machine.

Hope this helps.  I gave it 3 stars because I thought that having to go through all of that just to get disc 1 to boot was a bit extreme especially since the other discs work just fine.",1250640000,7,1349,4.255905511811024

I really like the Starship Troopers movie, so I decided to support the Tippet artists and bet all three. What I got was an experience that was varied yet still felt complete. Even as such though because of the camp and the tone of the movie I can still only recommend this for fans of the original.

The focus is different but still feels apart of the universe. In the first film we get a glimpse at the entire war from a very wide scale in addition to the POV of the main characters. The second brings you back into the war but with a much closer and intimate view of a particular squad. The claustrophobic broken down outpost that the main characters bunker down in, is surrounded by bugs. This only helps to heighten the tension of the second film. The last film is a more personal journey again but is a bigger scale than the second film. We get to see the long standing effects this war has had on the people and troops and more information is given to us about the bugs that lead to a satisfying conclusion.

I recommend this for fans of Starship Trooper and Sci fi alike but if you are not into either one, then these movies might not fit your tastes.",1221696000,13,1318,4.201581027667984

He must enjoy seeing Casper's rear end (and I'm not talking about the ghost). Brings a little side point of view from outer space. The Blu-Ray transfers are excellent; esp. needed for the second one - a lot of dark scenes/smokey effects. This was one of my items in my wish list. Can't hardly wait for the Star Wars B/R to come out; thank you very much, Mr. Lucas!",1219104000,3,490,4.279569892473118
3416808,4,B0018CWW96,"Starship Troopers (4 stars out of 5)
Bucketloads of bloody fun...literally.  This first film is very fresh, original, and unique (as it is with all of Paul Verhoven's films).  It's also very gory, gooey, and gross (sure to scare away the squeamish).  Has some interesting satire throughout.  The story is engaging.  The characters (and thus the acting and writing) are good.  The action and special effects are awesome, even by today's standards.  Highly reccomended for all sci-fi fans who don't mind some gnarly parts.

Starship Troopers 2:  Hero of the Federation (1.5 out of 5)
Very bad on all levels.  Bad story, photography, writing, acting, and production value.  Even the special effects are substandard.  Very dull all around.

Starship Troopers 3:  Maurader (3.75 out of 5)
Good, especially when compared to the second one in the series.  It retains the same style, sense of action, and attitudes of the first film.  Storyline is allright, and the characters are good.  Has stronger political and religious themes and content.  Still less than par, but nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be.

The first film in this series is most worthwhile watching; the other two are kind of a hit-and-a-miss.  The second film suffers tremendously, but could still be good if you want to see a mindless B-rated flick.  The third one is great, but most people will hate it if they didn't like any one of the others.  But for most sci-fi fans, it's a great series.

It may also be good to note that these films are probably not true to Robert Heinlein's original novel.

The Blu-Ray discs have really great video and sound quality for the most part.  The second film doesn't have perfect video quality, but is mostly good.  The third film doesn't have perfect sound quality, but is still watchable.  All discs have a good array of special features (especially the first film, which includes all of the original features from the 2-disc DVD set (featurettes, deleted scenes, screen tests, and more!) plus brand-new featurettes and special Blu-Ray stuff).

I've added another star to this rating, for the quality of the discs and the fact that they're a whole lot of fun.  If you've found this review unhelpful, feel free to leave some feedback so I can improve this and future reviews.",1218758400,39,2285,4.832041343669251
3416809,5,B0018CWW96,"I know I will shock those who read this, and it may insult Heinlein enthusiasts, but I loved all three Starship Troopers films; there I said. Why you may ask? Well I remember when I was younger and I saw the trailer for the first big budget spectacle back in 1997. I was too young to understand the whole point of the movie, but things were blowing up, bugs were being killed; it was essentially an adrenaline rush throughout the entire movie. So, obviously I bought the VHS tape when it came out, and seven years later a sequel came out. A sequel considered so bad that some SST fans are trying to get a petition going to rename the movie. Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation was a low budget (seven million dollars) direct to video release directed by Phil Tippet I believe. The film used recycled footage from the first one and became more of a horror film than an action extravaganza. The film had to have made some money because here we are at No. 3 Starship Troopers 3: Marauder. Shockingly I loved this one just as much as the first! With a budget of only twenty million dollars and with the return of Casper Van Dien as Johny Rico from the first film, I can honestly call this my guilty pleasure trilogy, something to watch when I am either bored or basically just for kicks. Like my dad who is more of a Trekkie (sorry if I miss spelled that) I have become a Troopy or whatever corny nickname they want to coin people who loved the SST movies (I am sure some movie buffs just call us morons for short). Anyway, all three DVDs are loaded with special features on the making of and of course director and actor commentary. (Sadly however  some special features on the two-disc special edition of the first film are not on the one in this trilogy). As far as transfers go, the picture and sound quality were good on my A30 HD DVD player. If you hated the sequels, then just stick with the first movie. However if you want to give the third film a chance and want it all in a cool looking box set. then this is for you. In my opinion these films are not nearly as bad as anything you'd see as a Sci-Fi original movie, I loved these films, and I know I am in the minority on that, but then again to each his own I believe the saying is.",1218326400,68,2248,4.24009324009324
3416810,3,B0018CWW96,"This is the only way to pick up the entire trilogy on Blu-Ray.  At this point, I'm going to guess that you, like me, loved the first film.  If not, why are you even considering buying a box set featuring three films, two of which were direct-to-video?  So, I'll skip over the original and assume you're already sold on it.

The second film is a pretty low-budget film, and it's not very good and doesn't even really fit in with the other two movies.  So, I think the term ""trilogy"" is applied pretty loosely here.  Still, despite its low budget, it did do a few things right and isn't completely a waste of time.  The transfer isn't that great as the picture is quite grainy.  I haven't seen it on DVD.  Just judging from the Blu-Ray, there shouldn't be a big jump in quality from the DVD to the Blu-Ray.  I doubt they spent much time upgrading the quality of the picture and sound, if at all.

Starship Troopers 3 is more of a sequel to the first film, and it was pretty average.  It's nice that they were able to get Casper Van Dien back; it definitely helps out the film.  The scope of this film is more limited than the first, and it's a little goofier, campier, and just plain weird.  The CGI is not very convincing at times.  This film isn't all bad, though.  The picture and sound quality are pretty good, especially considering this was straight to video.

I'd recommend renting the second and third films if you have any interest, and then determine if you want to buy it.",1217980800,99,1481,4.346715328467154
