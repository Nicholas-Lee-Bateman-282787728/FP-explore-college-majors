8385981,2,B0030N7IRM,"This must have been a fun evening. It's was an evening built around a special presentation of MILDRED PIERCE shown at the CASTRO Theater in San Fancisco. I guess you can imagine what a riot that would be.

A gaggle of Bad drag queens do their respective salutes to Joan Crawford. Fay Dunaway has nothing to worry about.

This is followed by an interview with Ann Blyth. Ann looks great. She's friendly, bright and funny. By the time she is finished the audience is eating out of her hand.

To recreate this evening, bring your own copy of MILDRED PIERCE. Also, wear your hearing aid. Unfortunately for us who were not there, the sound is muddled. it is difficult to hear Ann and it makes for an uncomfortable listening experience. I wonder if a good audio engineer could make this listenable.",1370822400,,792,4.602836879432624
