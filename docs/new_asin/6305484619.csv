1039569,5,6305484619,An excellent dramatization of a true story.  The film captures the emotional highs and lows of a spy - his rewards and his fears. You really see into his mind.  Good suspense.  Great work by Timothy Hutton.,984441600,10,206,4.513513513513513

7890601,4,6305484619,"Aldrich Ames: Traitor Within, 1998 film

Aldrich Ames career is paused, he needs more money. What are his options? Hell think of something. Years later he has a $3,000 monthly telephone bill (his wife calls her mother in Bogota Columbia). Do they need friends? Counseling? Cant they fit in? Do they consider themselves better than others? [Does pride go before a fall?] They are behind in their bills. Ames works for a Certain Intelligence Agency in Washington DC, in charge of Soviet counter-intelligence. He meets his counterpart. Do they have something in common? Did Ames leave something on the subway? His attache case was turned in by a schoolteacher. His drinking affected his work? [Was it unusual?] He is reprimanded by his superior. He blames rumors on jealous associates. Ames looks at his performance report - it wasn't good. Is policy supposed to be based on intelligence? Not for the ambitious who get ahead by telling their superiors what they want to hear.

Ames types a letter, he mentions $50,000. He telephones from a public telephone booth. [Would these calls be recorded and traced?] He offers a contact for mutual benefits. Yes, I understand. Back at work he attends a meeting. [Note his attitude.] Did he sell out two Soviet agents, recalled to Moscow? He has arrests for spying. How did this happen? Was there a leak? Ames gives a small gift to a Soviet agent. These ten names will be arrested and shot. But he is told this will send a message! Ames is later given a small envelope that shows gratitude. They learn F. Lee Howard has defected and blame him for the leak. The decision to arrest US agents was made by the highest authority. Will this point to Ames? No, he is assured. The lost data came from electronic sources; it was a data breach. A small group will research old cases to find a clue to the leaks. Ames buys an expensive imported car. [This attracts attention and envy.]

For security Ames communication will be by dead drops. Ames is praised by his Soviet partner and promised a new house in Russia. The leaks are too diverse to be a communication breach, it has to be an official (GS-14 or higher). They will check spending patterns. This group narrows its search. They ask for more help and are sent a young man. Ames looks for a new big home for his small family. He calls a Swiss bank to transfer $600,000 to an account in Bogota Columbia. [Will this raise a red flag?] His wife notices changes, Ames tells her a story. He needs the money. Ames has to take a polygraph test and wants to beat the machine; he gets advice. It works! Two years later his manager tells of changes at work. The FBI is looking at the CIA. Ames tries to get information with his computer terminal. Ames is given the assignment of talking to a Soviet defector.

Unbelievable! Is there a big risk? Ames validates this defector. [Verify his bona fides?] They learn the spy is in the building, the list of suspects is narrowed. Jean asks for research into financial records. There is a peaceful change of government in Moscow; Yeltsin in power. Why didn't the CIA have a clue? Ames arranges a meeting, but he makes a mistake! The CIA makes changes in supervisory assignments; Ames will have more access to sensitive information now. [Was this a trap?] Bank deposits matched his meetings with the KGB, he pays cash for big purchases. The worst day in CIA history. The CIA calls the FBI. Then Ames gets a call to return to his office for a problem. He is arrested by the FBI! Its done says Jean. Ames confessed and cooperated; his wife got a light sentence. The President ordered an overhaul of the Agency.

This is based on a true story but certain events were dramatized. What causes betrayal? Eric Amblers novel Epitaph for a Spy had the answer: he did it for the money. The takedown at the end seems dramatized (unless the FBI was not allowed on CIA property). The book Operation Splinter Factor tells about an important counter-espionage action in the 1940's. The book The Double-Cross System explains why the British were superior to their Nazi opponents: they were more honest and moral, they didn't profit from their spies like the Germans did, and inspected their reports for possible false information.",1456272000,,4228,4.669798657718121

7890603,5,6305484619,"Timothy Hutton is superb in this HBO production.  In fact, the best spy film I've ever seen.  I watch it over and over again.  It is chilling. The acting is terrific and the pace is swift.  You feel like you're part of every gripping moment.  Aldrich Ames himself participated in the production, so it's very authentic.

I've been watching movies for three-quarters of a century (and in several languages) and this is near the top of my list.

The critics were lukewarm but what do they know?",1359504000,3,492,4.586206896551724
7890604,5,6305484619,"PLOT: broke Aldrich Ames get ahead by selling CIA SECRETS~ VERY GOOD MOVIE~

SHOWTIME does it right~ Aldrich Ames is a second generation CIA operative~ set in the late 1970s~ discouraged by his lack of progress up the CIA power ladder~ he is broke with a second marriage TROPHY WIFE who spends an easy $3,000 a month in phone bills to Columbia~ he spends much of the movie~DRINKING AND WORRYING HOW TO PAY HIS BILLS~so how does he pay that big bill? Ames is played by Timothy who NAILS THIS ONE~ Hutton plays this low key and is very good as AMES who blends in far too good he is over looked in advances, ideas and just about everything. HIS new trophy wife #2 has him BROKE paying her out of control spending so he decides those OLD OUT OF DATE FILES could give him some cool cash~ and not cause too much damage~ so HE gets $50,000 from the Russians~ KGB~~ EZ money~ UNLIKE OTHER SPY THRILLERS we see the main motive for Ames is money. But along the way we spot his bitterness in lack of advancement. When money is better than he dreamed~ he takes IT and does not look back regardless of the KGB double agents who die ~ soon with the fall of the IRON CURTIN AND RUSSIA Ames decides he can GET even and ADD get rid of any double agents who may have a clue who he is so he turns in over a dozen double agents and earns a COOL $2 MILLION~ SOON Ames has a new Jaguar and his half a million dollar house he paid for in cash just shows us how little any one paid attention but THE CIA has some good ""agents"" of their own~ three older ladies who take the time and dig up the CLUES both financial dates and times of pay offs~ and and who had ACCESS and all clues POINT to AMES who just did not figure out his $60,000 a year salery could not support his lavish habits.
Hutton is great complete with that tacky little 1970s moustache and wide ties~ AND LETS NOT FORGET THE ""TRENDY"" AVIATOR GLASSES~ Lol~add Elizabeth Pena as the beautiful TROPHY WIFE/ MONEY HUNGRY GAL .
only about 90 minutes but it moves along well and very good overview of ones of the BIGGEST baddest CIA SPIES IN RECENT HISTORY~ ALSO SEE BREACH WITH CHRIS COOPER~
I GIVE THIS VHS a 10 out of 10 for spy tale~ ~ it has not been released on DVD  yet.",1246665600,5,2210,4.1491841491841495
7890605,3,6305484619,Movie was in ok condition.  There is quite a bit of color banding throughout.  Is in watchable condition.,1223078400,2,105,4.777777777777778
7890606,4,6305484619,"I tried for a long time to find this, and finally did. Another writer is right: This one should be released on DVD some day.

After a destructive molehunt in the 1960s, CIA liked to boast that it had never had a penetration at the staff level, fobbing off the few penetrations that hit the news in the 1970s and 1980s as low level employees, former agents, subcontractors or other misfits. Aldrich Hazen Ames drove home the point that it could and did happen to CIA. He was the highest-ranking and most destructive penetration up until the FBI's Robert Phillip Hanssen was caught several years later.

Timothy Hutton does a surprisingly commendable job as Ames, despite a downplaying of the emotions that must have driven this man to betray his country. He is picked up in mid-career, encountering professional setbacks due to his own lack of motivation, his ego, his sloppiness in security matters, his failure to recruit Soviets and his excessive drinking. We follow his frustration as he gradually immerses himself in espionage for the Soviets, up to the moment of his dramatic arrest.

Few real CIA officers are identified by name, but those who are include molehunters Jean Vertefeuille and Sandy Grimes, who seem to get the credit for figuring out that a suspicious string of roll-ups of Soviets working for the US can be laid at Ames's doorstep. There are, however, persistent rumors that Ames was actually betrayed by a KGB officer working for the US.

Two odd things about the film: This is Hutton's second outing as a spy against the US. Some years back, he played Christopher John Boyce, a disaffected counterculture subcontractor to the CIA who sold US satellite secrets to the Soviets in Mexico City (""The Falcon and the Snowman""); and one of technical consultants to the Ames film was...Aldrich Hazen Ames, himself!

A great film for anyone interested in true spy stories, or who has read books about the case (David Wise's ""Nightmover"" among the best).",1214956800,6,1967,4.877245508982036
7890607,5,6305484619,"The acting in this movie is simply some of the best I have ever seen.

The fact that it all happened very close to what is portrayed in the movie only adds to its strength. David W.",1172188800,5,181,3.891891891891892
7890608,1,6305484619,"Step by step we are moving to the truth.

The fiction is banal. Hence - one star for the movie. The reality is amazing. Hence - 5 stars for the next movie on the Ames-Colby case. The next movie will be based on Dekov's memoirs.",1148947200,14,227,4.044444444444444
7890609,1,6305484619,"The book is far far far ... far away from the truth. So far, that this book is complete non-sense. By the way, the reality is much more excited than the book.

The biggest crime of the former FBI Director Freeh is that he lies the society. The uninformed society does not have the possibility to protect itself. This is big crime. An excellent example is the killing of the CIA Director William Colby. Freeh preferred to kill Colby, instead to charge him officially. The FBI stories of Ames and Colby are far far... far away form the truth. (If you are interested to read the real story, read the memoirs of Dekov at the Web, Google Groups, Search, ""Dekov, Colby"".) The society is the loser. The society will pay big money. The society will give victims. This is very dangerous criminal activity against the American people. The persons who praise the Director Freeh will pay the price, too. Their children will die, as the whole nation. The USA Senate must accept a special law, forcing the FBI to say the truth. The truth is the only chance for salvation of the American nation. And the most important - Freeh must go into the jail, as killer of the American nation.",1147910400,3,1168,4.535545023696683
7890610,5,6305484619,"It's the mid '80s, and Aldrich Ames is a 20 year CIA man, with a middle-level job, an alcohol problem, a wife who likes to spend a lot of money, and a load of debt. He is far enough up the food chain to get the kind of security clearance and information the KGB will pay a lot of money for, and he thinks he's smart enough to play both sides of the fence. Based on the true story of a famous spy case, it is well written, edited and paced, making it edge of the seat entertainment at times.

Timothy Hutton is terrific as Ames, capturing the dark side of the man, and his desperation; he's a mousy looking individual who sees the sands of time running out and is used to saying ""yes"" to his uppity wife, played with just the right mix of sensuality and toughness by Elizabeth Pea.

One of the bright lights in this film is Joan Plowright, who is fabulous as a CIA analyst, who along with 2 other mature women, works to find out who is causing the information leak; always a great character actress, she really has a juicy role here, and makes the most of it.

Directed by John Mackenzie, written by Michael Burton, and with a good score by Mark Ryder,  this film was made for the Showtime Channel, is way above cable TV fare, and for a low-budget production, delivers. If you like spy thrillers, you'll enjoy this intelligent adaptation of one of the worst breaches of security in CIA history. Total playing time is 100 minutes.",1112572800,14,1428,4.317164179104478
