8086846,5,B000BHUTRQ,"This is the DVD version of the original VHS.  Filmed at the Royal Albert Hall in London in July of 1995, it was the first concert tour for the sixteen-year-old violin prodigy.  It contains extras not on the original.  A must have for any die-hard Vanessa-Mae fan or collector.",1362009600,,276,4.591836734693878
8086847,5,B000BHUTRQ,"Vanessa liefert eine phantasievolle Show, Klassik und Pop in unnachahmlicher Weise verbindend. In popiger Adaptation klassischer Musikstcke ist sie grossartig. Sehr zu empfehlen!.",1358380800,,179,6.826086956521739
8086848,2,B000BHUTRQ,"I was amazed to see such poor video quality, then content also is not breath taking.
I would not buy it if I knew the level of this production.",1292716800,,143,3.9655172413793105
8086849,5,B000BHUTRQ,"Probably the only visual DVD of Vanessa Mae's performance.  Some people may dislike the sound of electric violins, but Vanessa is showing a tremendous performance mixing classical music with rock and dance music flavor.  Good quality DVD and fast shipping - far exceeded my expectations.",1290211200,5,287,5.355555555555555
8086850,3,B000BHUTRQ,"The then-teenage violinist gives a concert in London's prestigious Royal Albert Hall. Vanessa is okay, nothing super to watch but amazing in her self-assuredness for such a young woman.

In this live concert footage, she attempts to liven up the proceedings with some different kinds of tuns, from classic to rock, and with some dancing added and some small talk between numbers. I give her credit for that. She could just stand there and play the violin but she knows that's not much in visual entertainment. Sometimes she succeeds with these things, other time she doesn't, but she's young and she's trying. Living in London since she was four, she could speak English well, so there was no language barrier. I suspect she's a far better entertainer now, some dozen years after this was filmed. In fact, I'd like to see her now.

She's talented, and she's cute but overall this DVD is nothing special. It isn't her fault; watching someone play classical music on violin isn't exactly exciting. About a third of her numbers were classical which sound good, but you might as well just have the CD.",1245628800,4,1097,4.798941798941799
