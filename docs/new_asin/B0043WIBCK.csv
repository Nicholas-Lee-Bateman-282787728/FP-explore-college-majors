8415454,3,B0043WIBCK,"A very entertaining movie. I started watching the movie on TV to spend about 20 minutes before retiring for bed and ended up watching the whole movie. The songs are superb and the ""cliffhanger"" at the interval took me by surprise. Which is surprising for a Hindi movie. Aparr from that though it's just a Masala movie and thoroughly unbelievable, but no less enjoyable for that.",1399852800,,378,4.742424242424242
