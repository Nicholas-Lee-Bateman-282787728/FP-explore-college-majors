8134929,5,B000GWG6RS,This was the very first movie I ever saw in the movie theater when I was 7 0r 8 and was OBSESSED with it! It's an incredibley heart warming movie and a MUST SEE for all of us children of the 70's who idolized Jack Wild. I haven't seen it since as I have been unable to find it on a USA formated dvd. In rememberance of the tragic passing of Jack I think that this movie should be released so that all of our children can enjoy it as well. Is there ANYTHING we can do to make this happen?,1255305600,5,487,3.8316831683168315
8134930,5,B000GWG6RS,"If you enjoy family films, Ireland, Dorthy McGuire and Jack Wild, this film is for you and yours. I first saw this film in the theater when it first came out. I was attending a large elemetary school at the time and on the student council. Our council voted with my influence to rent this film for our annual spring video. As I recall it, all the students and faculty loved it as it so heart warming to experience family love especially from distant relatives.",1207612800,7,460,4.423529411764706
8134931,5,B000GWG6RS,I saw this movie years ago on the Movie Channel and I've been looking for it on DVD ever since.  I wish they would release it in the USA format.  I'm sure they'd get a lot of sales around St. Patrick's Day if not at other times of the year.,1174089600,6,240,3.78
