936909,5,6304898460,"What an amazing movie!  Ticket to Heaven takes us on a bumpy ride through cult hell.  David, played by Nick Mancuso, is, after a failed romance, primed for being sucked into a Moonie-like cult.  His descent into hell and  his friends' journey to pull him out make for riveting entertainment and  thought provoking viewing.  No one will forget the final few moments when  you say to yourself, ""What just happened here?""",947289600,6,418,4.802816901408451
937043,5,6304898460,This movie is a gem.  I remember seeing it in the 80's.  I enjoyed it and could not fathom why it never attained some degree of popularity.  I suppose it was dated.  It was past the era when the youth cults proliferated. I recall the difficulty of walking through an airport without being assaulted by a barrage of flower sellers and other cult do-gooders.  Worth a watch if you want to know more about that sort of thing.,1370908800,2,422,4.358974358974359
937044,5,6304898460,"Trust me when I tell you that this film is true. It is dead-on accurate down to every last detail, including the locations chosen for shooting, the method in which the characters were portrayed, Chicken walks, the whole nine yards. This film tells it like it really was. I was there and and experienced it my self., but all that takes place in this film is totally true and factual The movie is also totally riveting and well acted, Everything you'll see in the film is how it really happened. I was at The Randolph Heasrt house in Berkley, I was at Boonville as well. I was taught how to commit suicide successfullly in a room of devotees to the father. All this at age at the age of 17 and one to one years after I joined. The brainwashing is real. The effect it had on me was staggering. I escaped with a member of the Hells Angels and we made our way to the Bart station in SF. This cult was very evil, and very good at deprogramming you and at brainwashing. This all happened to me between 1978- 1980. The grip this cult has on people is very powerful. Even tough I have seen them for the cult they are, I stil miss some of my freinds there terribly. I miss Boonville to. I recently wrote a friend still in the cult who say's Boonville no longer exists and that they have moved their operations to the east US and other countries. This cult has very strong grip on their members. Even all these years later I wonder if maybe I made a mistale leaving them when I know it is so wrong to feel that way",1367625600,,1503,4.186206896551724

This is a very good movie about the psychology of brainwashing and cults.  Mancuso gives an EXCELLENT and believable performance, and Kim Cattrall just ropes you in with her charm.  A classic.",1232582400,2,341,7.947368421052632
937046,5,6304898460,"I still get chills whenever I watch this. In 1976, I spent a week in Boonville on the Moonie farm that is portrayed in this movie. I can recognize every aspect of the experience in the movie, and can identify individuals, particularly the ""boot camp"" trainer portrayed by Kim Cattrall. The chanting on the bus. The singing of ""Red, Red Robin"" at the crack of dawn. The dodgeball games. The never being allowed to be alone. The ""philosophical"" lectures. Fortunately, I was not psychologically weak and had no need to belong to a group, plus I am a lifelong atheist. I got bored and left after a week (they did not try to hold me by force). It was only much later that I discovered that this was an indoctrination camp for Reverend Moon, as they do not reveal this fact early on. If you want to understand the reality of the process of becoming a mindless cultist, this is the film to watch!",1229299200,5,889,4.426829268292683
937047,4,6304898460,"This is an excellent dramatization of how an ordinary man (an atheist Jew no less!) fell under the influence of a religious cult- modeled on the Moonies- and how he was eventually rescued and deprogrammed. It's a gripping movie, featuring several now-famous actors before they were well-known. I think it's an important movie for the light it shines on the workings of our weak, needy human psyche and the accusing finger it points at all groups which employ spiritually and mentally manipulative tactics to ensnare and retain members.

If this film's message were limited to cults, I wouldn't be that interested. After all, how many people are really  going off to live on communes under the direct control of some semi-divine leader? I don't think cults, per se, are such a big problem. Where I think we see the most widespread use of cultish practices is in many of the charismatic megachurches and their denominational offshoots that have proliferated throughout our suburbs and our airwaves.

Where else do we find such expert use of love-bombing, personality alteration, group elitism, sensory overload, financial exploitation and psychological manipulation carried out in support of a charismatic, authoritarian and unaccountable leader (pastor/prophet/apostle) whose messages are believed to be divinely inspired? The situation has gotten so bad that Congress is now holding hearings about some of these televangelists who have gotten obscenely rich telling their followers that God's blessings depend on how much money they donate to these pastors' ministries. I'm glad that these people are being put under public scrutiny, because one of the techniques used to deprogram a cult member is to expose the hypocrisy or worldliness of the holy leader. However, the preponderance of such churches blunts much of the positive effect the prison sentence of a Peter Popoff or Benny Hinn might have- their followers will easily just find another leader in the next time-slot on TBN. Hopefully, enough exposure might eventually cause a change, God willing.

I guess the lesson here is that we all want to be loved, and need a sense of belonging and importance somewhere. The trick is to be aware that a lot of people want to love you for their own ends, which may not be in your best interest. True love requires the surrender of your heart, not your mind. Jesus told us to be ""wise as serpents and innocent as doves."" (MT 10:16) A tough combo, to be sure, but necessary if we're to avoid ending up selling flowers in airports or giving our credit card number to TV preachers in flamboyant suits.",1200528000,6,2596,5.030232558139535
937048,5,6304898460,"TICKET TO HEAVEN is a most effective film, one that flew through theaters far too quickly on its initial run (thanks for the tip, Siskel & Ebert), shedding light on any number of obsessions. The focus is on a religious cult, but could as easily center around any pursuit where, with all the attractive chaff winnowed away, the end aim is making money for the top dogs or ideals. Where membership comes with a strident urging to include friends and relations.

As Linc Strunc (R.H. Thomson's extraordinary performance in a Genie-winning role) says, ""It's the smart ones"" who prove the most difficult to deprogram.

Nick Mancuso's David is intelligent, but he lacks what many are missing: Close human contact, permission to touch someone without fear or evoking sexual connotations. For many, that's like the difference between hugging your parents as a child, and the wall that goes up when you must ""be a man"" or ""put away childish things"".

The tools used to unhinge David's rationale are Legion: Beauty, peace, and belonging held up as within-reach (but cunningly and perpetually unattainable) goals. Simple messages that snowball. Inquisitiveness and discussion trampled as selfish distractions, with some subtle belittling. Repetition to instill new habits, relentlessly grinding in new beliefs. And then there's the food, and toying with body chemistry -- good science abused by clever minds.

A fine, memorable ensemble cast, from Guy Boyd's Eric, to Robert Joy's Patrick, to Timothy Webber's Greg, right down to Michael Wincott (THE CROW) in a minor role. Many of Canada's very best performers.

Saul Rubinek, who played nearly the same character in AGAINST ALL ODDS, goes to the other end of the scale here, however. A stalwart friend, Larry, never giving up however hard things get. A solid performance, one that embedded Rubinek's name in this reviewer's mind.

Paul Soles and Marcia Diamond are splendid as David's parents. Harvey Atkin adds some nice texture as Larry's boss. Who could say ""no"" to Kim Cattrall when she's this welcoming, and who wouldn't blanch before Meg Foster at her eeriest. Stephen Markle, as Karl, is a voice of reason who nonetheless does this to his friend, David.

And Nick Mancuso (HEARTBREAKERS, but who first impressed this reviewer in NIGHTWING) shines as David. Mancuso's a journeyman actor, always working, but rarely has a role so showcased his talents as TICKET TO HEAVEN. A performance you won't soon forget.

Most definitely deserving a new DVD release.",1146528000,14,2501,5.127764127764128
937049,4,6304898460,"This film is very difficult to find on VHS and/or DVD.  I saw it in a DVD store for 10 bucks a few years ago, so I picked it up.  The film is a terrifying, intense, very realistic one, depicting with great accuracy the truth about cults.  Nick Manusco gives an excellent performance as David, the young man who gets caught up in the cult.  He has just broken up with his girlfriend, and decides to visit a friend of his in southern California.  David doesn't know that his friend is in a cult.  They program David through various methods, including lack of sleep, moving around and around without reason, lack of protein in the food they eat, isolation, and fellow cult members following him around at all times.  Saul Rubinek plays his friend who finds out where he is, and helps get him out with a deprogrammer.  The film isn't perfect.  There are noticable continuity flubs, awkward edits, misplaced comic relief (even though the sign ""it's always amateur night"" in the comedy club is hilarious), but these are minor compared with the intensity and accuracy of the film.  This film was made in Canada (when Canadian film production was at a nadir), and it's a lot more realistic than a Hollywood film would be about the same subject.  There are excellent performances all around (check out a very young Kim Catrall as Debbie, a cult member who is scary in her loyalty to ""Father"").  Hopefully, somebody will reissue this film....",1145232000,24,1432,4.661354581673307
937050,4,6304898460,"You have to hand it to the Canadians for having the guts to make such a true-to-life movie about cults: how they recruit, how they brainwash, how they make money. A little more contrast between the blind euphoria of the lower-tier cultists and the opulent, materialistic ways of the upper echelon would have been nice. And the movie was obviously made on a shoestring budget, which no doubt is hard to accept for someone raised on Hollywood production values. But Hollywood would NEVER make a film like this -- not with all the cultists running around in Tinsel Town! They'd boycott the production. Solid performances are turned in by Nick Mancuso as the ""lost soul,"" Saul Rubinek as the friend who won't give up on him, Kim Cattrall as a bundle-of-energy cultist (actually one of the scariest characters in the film), and R. H. Thomson as the deprogrammer. If you can get past the made-for-TV-movie feel, this film is an excellent way to teach your kids about how cults operate and what they're really all about: money. --MellowMonk.com",1133654400,18,1037,4.831460674157303
937051,5,6304898460,"In the late 70's I got caught up in the Moonie cult for a time in Northern California. This is a very accurate portrayal of the moonies of that time and place, right down to the rickety converted chicken coop they had their talks in, the cult member who follows you everwhere, the ""choo choo yay pow"" cheer. (Yes they really did use that!) The enforced conformity, The famous dodge ball game with chanting. Deadly accurate.

  Though the material is dated, and the ranch in the countryside where The moonies brought recruits is long since shut down, it's still a great film to watch...and to show your kids if you want to help them learn to avoid being sucked into cults of many kinds.",1132617600,29,685,4.508064516129032
937052,5,6304898460,"Best film on religious cults yet!. Actually, this was the first of 3 films I have viewed on mind controlling religious cults. All three of the films were made in the early 80's a time when religious cults were at a high rise. Seen selling flowers in large city streets and airports.

 Ticket to Heaven not only explains how someone of high intelligence can become involved in a cult. It makes it believable, unlike "" BLINDED BY THE LIGHT""starring  Kristy McNichol and real life  brother Jimmy McNichol and ""SPLIT IMAGE"" starring Michael O'Keefer and Peter Fonda. Which if you haven't seen ""Ticket to Heaven "" before viewing these other films, would leave you with the feeling that only the weak minded, or troubled souls could be brainwashed into this way of life.

The deprogramming method of the cult victim David played by Nick Mancuso is brilliantly and intensely done by R. H. Thomson ( role Link Strunk) .  Also to be credited for adding some comedy to the film is Saul Rubinek who plays David's best friend Larry.

(Excuse the pun) A true Cult Classic!! You will not be disappointed !",1111708800,13,1091,4.680628272251309

7878841,5,6304898460,"I first saw part of this movie shortly after it came out when I stopped by a friend's house. It was riveting. I've never forgotten it. That was in 1981. That's how long it's stuck with me! I waited for a long time to purchase this, both because it was hard to find, and when I could, it was so expensive. Thanks to Amazon, I was finally able to buy it for a reasonable price. Nick Mancuso is brilliant in his role as a young man who is heartsick and falls into the hands of a cult. Overall, it's a great cast. But Saul Rubinek and Meg Foster stand out. And R.H. Thomson is believable and enthralling as the deprogrammer. An absolutely must-see for those who want to experience how a person is indoctrinated into an organization such as this and the desperate lengths to which loved ones will go to get them back.",1470268800,4,812,4.279220779220779

7878847,5,6304898460,"...this is the movie to nearly perfectly bring it into sharp focus.  A thinly veiled expos of the Moonies (you know, ISKCON, Rev. Sun Yung Moon's group) the methods for drawing in and making over an individual are on vivid display. Lest you think it can't happen to you, think again. And lest you think a much lighter version of this isn't happening to people in well known religious, economic and political cults, again, think again.

Nick Mancuso is brilliant as the lead and he is well supported by the other actors. Even though it is nearly 30 years old, it is a quality DVD and the age is really no bother at all. I highly recommend it.",1394236800,2,641,4.423728813559322
7878848,5,6304898460,"Although this is not a true story, I used to have a client who at one time fell into the clutches of a cult from this era (the 80s), and he stated that this film is dead on accurate. The client was deprogrammed out of the cult, then went to law school to become an attorney that sued such cults, and also helped to deprogram others.

This film is brilliantly written, produced, cast, and acted. It plays like a documentary. You will actually feel like what's happening is absolutely real and someone just happened to have a video camera handy. What exactly is happening? You are witness to the events that unfold for a lost human being searching for the truth and being misled and waylaid by a ""Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon"" style religious cult. This was the notoriously corrupt cult that received so much alarming press in the 1980's, the same decade 'Ticket to Heaven' was made.

Laid bare are the seductive techniques employed by a cult to draft new members. You are taken full cycle -from the victim's state of mind that opened the door to such a path, to his indoctrination into the cult, to his programming once membership was gained, and finally to his ""kidnapping"" by family and friends who then commence to deprogramming him.

It is the incredible realism of this film that makes it so compelling. The actors involved -including the great Saul Rubinek, who turned in a memorable Star Trek Next Generation episode as a villain in 'The Most Toys' - must have had to wash off some emotional scars that undoubtedly accumulated during filming. This is an adult film. Lock the kids up somewhere! :>",1372723200,,1610,4.6421052631578945
