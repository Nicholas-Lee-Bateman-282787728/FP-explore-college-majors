173698,5,0971366306,My developmentally delayed daughter LOVES this video!  This is the first and only video that we have found that she will actually watch from beginning to end.  The format works wonderfully for her and does not go too fast or too slow.  I love how it goes back and forth between the sign and clips of the animal/object being signed several times.  I use it with my daycare children too and have had postitive result with them.  Their parents are very surprised and pleased to see their children using ASL.  Even the grandparents are able to learn ASL to communicate better with my daughter!  Thanks for a great video!,1013990400,5,616,4.5963302752293576
173699,5,0971366306,"A well produced, engaging learning tool, and not just for the pre-verbal set. I watched this with my 2 1/2-year-old daughter, a fluent speaker and beginning reader. She was keenly interested in learning the signs, which she did with ease because of their clear presentation. The unexpected bonus in the video was the opportunity for her to connect the spoken words in the narration with their graphic representation on screen. We also liked the unobtrusive music and the presentation style of the ASL instructor. This is going in every baby gift basket I put together from now on.",1009584000,3,580,4.928571428571429
173700,5,0971366306,"Our family loves this video!  I had always wanted to learn sign language and now I have--along with my little girl!  Our daughter is 17 months old and always chooses this signing video over Elmo, Pooh, etc.!  There are over 50 signs, grouped into categories for easy learning.  The signs are very clear and easy to ""digest.""  You will be amazed at how quickly you and your child will be signing!

173701,5,0971366306,"My son is hearing and has been using sign language since he was 12 months old. He's now 2 1/2 and an ""old pro"" at mastering new signs and using known ones. His speech is developing rapidly now and I treasure videos like these to keep him interested in sign language.
I am not fluent in sign by any means but I still know quite a few signs. This video was instantly valuable to *me* as a parent because I learned new signs right off the bat. It's been said that it is extremely difficult to learn signs from illustrations in a book. Your best bet is to find a deaf person, a sign langauge interpreter, or purchase a video like this one. It has over 60 signs in it and the sign presenter does each sign very clearly.
I recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out signing with their baby or even ""old pros"" like Corbin and me. This is definitely an excellent video to give as a gift to a child of any age or even adults. Of course, sometimes we like to keep the good ones for ourselves!",1003968000,17,994,4.128865979381444
173702,5,0971366306,"A couple of weeks ago, I was able to review a couple of videos from
different companies directed at teaching sign language to babies. I
couldn't believe the difference between the two! One I can highly
recommend; the other I might recommend as entertainment for your
toddlers, but not for learning to sign.
Baby See 'n Sign, intended
for ages 6 months and up, shows parents and children how to sign 60
words using a variety of learning modes to reinforce the signs. Each
sign is demonstrated for 30 seconds in several different ways-a
picture (real life) of the object, the sign demonstrated by a sign
language professor, the object in action (a baby being dressed or a
child eating a banana, for example), the sign itself again in slow
motion, a different picture of the object and the sign again. For each
shot in the sequence, the sign is spoken as well shown on the screen
in text. The woman who signs on the video uses wonderful expression
and precise signs, both essential for learning sign language. At 14.99,
it's a good value that will encourage your whole family to learn a
fun, useful language.",1000339200,30,1105,4.642857142857143
173703,5,0971366306,"I got this for my son when he was 20 months old because he was referred to speech therapy.  He is delayed in talking, and they introduced the alternative of using sign language.  This DVD is not exciting and interactive, but my son (now 2 1/2) still loves sitting down to watch it and practice the signs.  It is very good at simply introducing a variety of commonly used early words to sign.  Also, since we've been signing, his interest in communicating (with words, actions and ideas) with me and other children has increased.",1244160000,,528,4.585106382978723
173704,3,0971366306,"I don't know if its just me but I didn't think this DVD had enough ""helpful"" words for a baby. I say it had about 5 words that was worth teaching myself and baby. But hey that's just me. I think that the DVD is more for education of the mommy or daddy not baby. Baby should learn the signs by the parent DEMONSTRATING them not by watching TV especially if under a year old.!",1236988800,,374,4.0
173705,5,0971366306,"Watched by the mom who said it repeats each sign 3 times, giving you a chance to actually get the movements (instead of doing it once and moving on).  She said she could also watch it with her baby and use it to help teach the baby while they watched together (baby was about 11 months old).
I had gotten it b/c it came highly rated on a website of products for non-hearing folks, and the only criticism I read on the website was that the DVD was basically a video on a DVD with no ability to choose a certain lesson without starting at the beginning and fast-forwarding.  I think its approach to teaching outweighs that criticism about the technology.",1212364800,3,652,4.380165289256198
173706,3,0971366306,This video introduces a lot of sign language but it's not interesting for a child.  It's great for a parent to watch and then the parent can use the signs with the child throughout the day.,1209686400,,189,4.25
173707,5,0971366306,My grandson was introduced to this video at age 4 mos. What a wonderful time we all had learning the signs and reenforcing them in daily activites. By 8 mos. he was attempting to perform the signs himself and responding in kind when we would sign to him. His verbal skills progressed along with the signing because we spoke while we signed. By the age of 12 mos. he was watching for us to make a sign with every new word or activity we introduced...(we had to reference ASL web sites for additional signs to meet his growing need for new information). He is now 26 mos. old and uses sign daily along with his verbal communication. He has an extensive vocabulary and has been speaking in sentences since the age of 20 mos. We highly recommend the series and encourage the extended family members to participate as well.,1189296000,,818,4.496644295302014

Light elevator music in the background, signs not represented well enough with examples.  If you want something that will engage your child and get him/her involved, get ""Baby Signing Time!"" or ""My Baby Can Talk"".  My daughter LOVES those two series and has learned over 50 signs from them (we started at 11 months)!",1177891200,,460,4.6419753086419755

It has the signs set up in sections where you can play them all at once or you can pick which ones you want to play. It has some signs I can't ever seeing us using, but its so exciting to see my little one signing along and laughing.",1168387200,,367,3.972972972972973
173710,2,0971366306,"I'm an early childhood educator, always looking for products and activities to enhance development and communication.  This one is not one of my favorites.  Once a child is signing, this may be a good choice as it presents a larger vocabulary than most other signing videos.  But the presentation is pretty straightforward, with most of the signs shown by an adult.  Pretty boring for kids, I think.  But maybe a good tool for parents to learn signs to share with their kids.  The best of this genre is the ""My Baby Can Talk"" series.",1168300800,4,533,4.617021276595745

173712,4,0971366306,"Although this video is not as professional as Baby Einstein for example, it does work.  My now 20 month old daughter was not very interested at first, but she is now requesting this video about twice a week (she only watches 1 video per day).  She does not do the signs as she is watching it (like she does with the Baby Einstein), but when I use the signs with her at any other time, she 100% understands and can say the word audibly.

I give it 4 stars only because I think it is a little careless to show babies incorrectly strapped into car seats.  Another minor thing is that it depicts dolls and calls them babies - even a 20 month old can see through that!!

It does teach the signs and that's the important thing, and despite the flaws in this one I think I am still willing to purchase the Baby See 'N Sign #2 at some later date.",1160438400,,838,4.116564417177914

I actually expected to be disappointed and relieved that I hadn't spent more money.  The exact opposite happened!  I'm so happy with this video! If you want to take a class for the social interaction - go ahead - but don't waste your money on it or other videos if all you really want to do is learn signs that you'll USE!

He definitely picked that up from is dvd.  He knew how to identify many objects because of the dvd.  We have volume 2 too and at 17-months old, he's mastered 90% of the signs in vol. 1 and about 50% of the signs in vol. 2.  He selects what he likes to identify and learns the signs and words.

I started showing the video to my daughter when she was about 7-8 months old.  As a parent, I have concerns about how much and what my child watches on TV.  This video relieved my fears because while it was entertaining, it was slow paced and calming. Using babies captured my daughter's attention and she

began signing herself. At about 1 year old, it was the video she most requested to watch. At about 18 months, I loaned the video to my friend.  Incredibly, since then, my daughter began using signs from the video that we never used together! She is now 22 months and I have to laugh when I read that the average 2-3 year old uses 300 words. My daughter was using over 50 at 16 months and now greatly exceeds 300 words. She talks regularly in four-word sentences and sometimes uses 5-6 word sentences. My friends and family are amazed at how developed her verbal skills are for her age.  I credit her advanced language skills with her learning sign language. In addition, I have viewed other sign language videos children. The pace was often too fast for a baby or not entertaining for a baby. In addition, many sign language videos do not use ASL which I found disappointing. Who knows if she will ever use ASL in her adult life, but we definitely know she won't have a need for ""baby signs.""",1137628800,23,1533,4.3543859649122805
173720,3,0971366306,"My main complaint about this DVD is that it is basically a video, but on a DVD.  There is no DVD menu to choose which part to play, so you have to watch the introduction and tutorial parts (or fast forward through them) each time.  I liked ""My Baby Can Talk"" better.  That said, the content of the video is good.  If it had a more user-friendly format on the DVD, I would like it a lot.",1130371200,17,386,3.9740259740259742

173723,3,0971366306,"I've been playing this video for my daughter every morning, since she was 6 months old.  At 10 months she signed  ""bye bye"".  The next week, she signed ""hat"" (unfortunately, there is not much use in signing this word at this age...) Every week, she seems to add one sign.  The next week, she signed ""eat"", which is awesome cause now she tells me when she wants to eat!!  At 11 months, she signed ""more"", which she uses when we are feeding her.  The video shows an illustration of the word, says the word aloud, and also writes the word.  Then, the ASL teacher signs the word.  Each word is shown and signed three times.  The repetition is great for young children. I do wish that the video had more practical words like ""come"", ""be careful"", ""sleepy"", etc. instead of farm animals!!  Although at the end of the tape, there is a code to get more signs online... just not practical cause I can't remember the free signs that I saw online!  Oh well, my daughter loves the tape and it seems to be working so far.  It has been a great purchase, all in all.",1103328000,3,1051,4.3061224489795915

It is very clear about how to do the sign and what it is that they are signing.  It is also entertaining and keeps the babies attention.  We've had the video for a couple of weeks and the babies are picking up new signs every time we watch it.  It is so cute to see them sign and they are so proud of themselves.  I think it is really helping their frustration levels as well!,1102982400,2,498,4.030612244897959
173725,5,0971366306,"I purchased Baby See N' Signs I and II on DVD when my son (my second child) was about 6 months old.  I had learned about teaching sign language to babies who were having trouble hearing, then researched it on the internet, and was fascinated by the benefits for babies and kids to learn sign language even if they can hear.  I turned these videos on and let him watch, and he loved to watch them because of the pictures and sounds (cow mooing, etc.)  It's like a sign language book on video, which is great because you can see how the signs are supposed to be signed.  Even if you don't intend on teaching your child sign language, it will teach him or her words and language.  Then at the same time, they watch the sign being repeated 3 times, with a different picture of that same word 3 times, and they can't help but learn the signs, and neither could I.  It was much easier, fun, and faster to learn than from a book with hand-written pictures that you have to try to interpret. Also, I have learned that sign language uses the other side of the brain than speech, so both sides of the brain are used when learning sign language and verbal language.

I wanted to teach my son ASL because I heard that sometimes boys can be slower at speech than girls, and I wanted to try to give him an advantage.  Well, I sure gave him an advantage!  Either the sign language worked, or I was totally wrong!  He spoke earlier and knew many more verbal words (than my daughter did at his age), plus a hundred signs or more by the time he was 18 months old.  It was (and still is, now that he's 22 months old) WONDERFUL to learn and teach him the sign language!  We could communicate before he could talk... it was great.  I knew if he was hungry or thirsty, or wanted a bottle, or was wet, or he saw a bird, or saw a car before he could even form the words.  It almost felt like I had ESP!  People I was around were amazed I knew what he was ""talking"" about without a single word from his mouth!  Now that he is talking VERY well, he still uses the signs along with the words many times, because he almost thinks they ""go together"".  I still ""test"" him on the signs to make sure he doesn't forget them.... because this is a second language!  And my 5 year old daughter has learned many of the signs too. (I didn't have this video when she was a baby).

I can still put these videos in, and he's just as thrilled to watch these as any other video we have.  It's entertaining to him, even though it's not necessarily an entertainment video, and I feel good about putting in something educational instead of cartoons or something.  I have been so excited about the experience this has been teaching my son sign language.  And I'm so proud that he is so smart! I have been encouraging people I know with babies to teach them sign language, and I always recommend Baby See N' Sign!",1101168000,6,2865,4.227941176470588
173726,5,0971366306,"This video is phenomenal!  It not only made quick learning for me but our 18 month old son was mesmerized by it!  Our older daughters were 3 and 5 at the time and they learned all of the signs quickly!  I had bought so-o-o-o-o many sign language books but found my visual brain quite challenged at ""getting"" the gist of the signs.  We had no idea what a blessing the video would be for our family.  Our son was diagnosed with verbal apraxia at the age of 2.  It's a neurological disorder that affects the physical ability to utter speech sounds.  Thank God for this video!  This video not only taught him communication skills, but reinforced those skills bolstering his confidence level and his ability to learn even more signs. He was able to communicate with us using his sign language even though he couldn't say the words.  At an age where most children are able to speak 100 words, he could sign over 150 words while he spoke only 5.  Nothing adequately replaces the visual demonstration of the signs.  The repetition of each sign paired with an actual live shot of what the sign represents had an amazing teaching result with our children.  I can't recommend this video enough!",1099958400,2,1183,4.580952380952381

At one year he was showing no signs of communication skills.  Looking for a way to communicate with him I searched the internet and found Baby See 'N Sign I and II on [...]  I ordered the videos and within days he was communicating with us.

Now, these are his favorite videos over any Disney, Paramount, Universal or any other video.

Today, at 2-years-old, he will stop all activities to watch the videos.  He does the sign, says the words and imitates the appropriate sound that is played on the video that correlates to the picture on screen.  The pace is excellent to encourage proper learning.

I am so pleased our communication has enhanced.  Whenever I sign to him, he smiles and signs back. I am ecstatic he is learning another language, he will have this knowledge for life.

We look forward to more videos to come.",1099699200,,1053,4.699453551912568

While I was impressed with the repetition and clarity of the signs demonstrated, I was disappointed in the limited practical signs.  I would like to have seen more ""food"" signs.  Also, signs for ""thank you"", ""all done"", etc. were not included in this video.  The farm segment could have been eliminated altogether and replaced with more practical words/signs used daily.

At first, she would only watch a couple of minutes at a time.  I would put in the tapes and let them run while we were playing nearby. Eventually she became extremely interested in the colorful pictures, and she actually began signing along with the tape.
Now my daughter wants to know the signs for EVERYTHING.  I cannot believe how receptive she has been!  I never would have thought it possible.  And yet, although she can say only five or six words, she can sign around 20.

173730,5,0971366306,"TEACH first with ""Baby See n Sign.""  Then ENTERTAIN with ""Signing Time."" Both are based on American Sign Language and are designed for hearing children.  I purchased the first volumes of these two products when my son was 14 months old.  At the time, he had a signing repertoire of about 10 signs, including ""eat,"" ""milk,"" ""more,"" ""water,"" and a handful of others.  As a teacher of English as a second language, I know that teaching vocabulary to beginners in any language requires clarity and repetition.  I found these 2 qualities most prevalent in ""Baby See n Sign"" Volume 1; over 60 signs are presented one at a time in a clear, focused manner, not amidst an entire story or series of songs.  Admittedly, ""Signing Time"" is more entertaining with lots of real and animated images, lively music, songs, and children performing signs; but there are only 18 signs on the first volume, the signs sometimes lack context, and the children do not provide the best examples of how to produce the signs.  Their variations, while cute and interesting to adults, may be too distracting and confusing for a young beginner.  Save ""Signing Time"" for an entertaining reinforcement, and start with ""Baby See n Sign.""
The 60+ signs on ""Baby See n Sign"" are divided into several categories, such as ""Food,"" ""Let's Get Dressed,"" and ""Down on the Farm""; each category has about 8 signs.  I do not recommend that a small child watch this video from beginning to end; there is too much information.  What worked for my son and me was to watch one category every few days.  We then practiced those signs while having a snack, getting dressed, or playing with his Fisher Price farm animals.  And everyday, we watched that section of the video again for further practice and review.  It took us about 3 weeks to get through all of the categories, and he now produces most of the signs, some more correctly than others.
We then moved on to ""Signing Time"" which has been such a fun reinforcement to ""Baby See n Sign."" Most of the ""Signing Time"" Volume 1 signs had already been introduced on ""Baby See n Sign"" Volume 1.  My son really enjoys watching the other children sign what he already knows, and he adores the songs. He's even been able pick up the few new signs from ""Signing Time""; I just make sure to demonstrate the correct sign on several other occasions. We have recently acquired the remaining volumes of both products.  ""Baby See n Sign"" Volume 2 has over 100 signs and uses the same clear format.  Volumes 2 and 3 of ""Signing Time"" have about 60 signs total, and the entertainment value gets better with each volume-a really great song called ""Magic Words"" on Volume 2 highlights the use of ""please"" and ""thank-you,"" and my son loves ""The Silly Pizza Song"" on Volume 3.
""Baby See n Sign"" and ""Signing Time"" have been instrumental in my son's progress with signing AND speaking.  He is now 17 months old, and he recognizes about 80 signs; he can produce about 40 of them, and we're learning more everyday.  We have so much to talk about all the time.  I truly believe that using ""Baby See n Sign"" in the introductory phase of signing makes ""Signing Time"" that much more meaningful and enjoyable.  GET THEM BOTH!!  Another great resource for signs not included on either video is the Michigan State University's on-line ASL Browser at [...]  There you'll be able to click on a word and see a live person demonstrating the sign.  I've found this website invaluable for introducing signs for things my son is particularly interested in.",1076544000,49,3522,4.663430420711974
173731,5,0971366306,"I am so very impressed with this video set!  When my son was about 10 months old, I began to teach him sign language using books as a reference for learning it myself.  I found that the flat diagrams were often up to my inexperienced interpretation.  The videos were so easy for both my son and I to follow and practice with that now my two year old son and I both know nearly all of the signs on both videos!  My husband and mother have also learned many of our most often used words in sign language and are able to understand and reciprocate our efforts.  I was pleased to discover that learning signs from books and flash cards became easier since I now had a reference point from which to interpret the movements in the pictures. My son and I speak our second language often throughout the day, with and without spoken words to accompany it.  My husband and I have found that sometimes our toddler will respond better to our nonverbal sign language reminders and commands when he is being too emotional or distracted to listen to our verbal cues!  We've even had the pleasure of coming across a deaf gentleman who works at a local store and who was delighted that we made the effort to speak his language:)  I am planning on getting the DVD set and then lending my videos to interested friends and I eagerly look forward to future publications!",1075939200,4,1349,4.433198380566802
173732,3,0971366306,"I recently purchased Signing Time and then Baby See 'N Sign Vol. 1&2.  Signing Time, I believe is better for younger children.  My children definitely enjoy that DVD more.  There are children doing signs and lots of music and it is very playful.  However, the See 'N Sign DVDs have more signs and they are a little cheaper.  If you are wanting to have a variety of programs to teach & reinforce signs to your child, then these are a good buy.
Also, these are available on DVD at their website.",1074816000,5,493,4.373626373626373
173733,5,0971366306,"My interest in the Baby See `N Sign videos is two-fold.  First, as a professional in the educational technology field, I value appropriate and effective use of any type of technology for the purpose of teaching children (as well as adults).  These videos certainly accomplish those goals.  The words are suitable for babies and toddlers who are beginning to put their language skills together.  Each word is repeated six times - three with example pictures and three with the signer.  At the same time, the word is continuously shown on the screen.  The pictures, as well as the signer, are displayed in full-screen.  What I really appreciate is that the signer is shown in slow motion during the 2nd of the three times each sign is shown.
I am also the mother of a 1-year-old.  I've been working with my baby using the Baby See `N Sign videos since he was about 9 months old.  I wasn't sure how well it was working, but suddenly in the past few weeks, evidence that he understands has surfaced.  He quacks when I sign ""duck.""  He looks to the refrigerator when I sign ""bottle"" or ""milk.""  And he signed ""eat"" for the first time last week.  This may not seem remarkable, but for someone who suffered through her first child seething in anger because I could not understand what sounded like Russian from him, I am wholeheartedly a believer.  Everyone in the family uses signs with him and I know this will help all of us communicate with him better during the next two or three years.
So, both as a professional educator, and as a mother, I recommend Baby See `N Sign for anyone who wants an easy, fun, and entertaining way to learn signing with their baby.",1069027200,,1657,4.554054054054054
173734,5,0971366306,"My 16-month-old daughter doesn't watch TV, has no interest in other videotapes, but she LOVES these videos -- and she's learning more every day!!! We've had them for about eight weeks now, and I stopped counting when she'd learned about 60 signs; she knows even more now. We had assimilated about 20 signs into our vocabulary before we got the tapes, but these tapes have put us on the fast track.
Suddenly, she's asking us to come with her to watch the ""baby video"" all the time -- and she made up the name. She doesn't verbalize yet, but she sure signs, and she made up that name for the videos (but there are both babies and toddlers, as well as adults). She'll turn the TV on, turn the VCR on, and look at us making the baby sign. I guess it's helping her manual dexterity too!
She watches it and tries to do ALMOST EVERY SIGN. She even anticipates them, doing the next one as the current one ends. And it's helping her to talk, too. The other night she tried to say turtle when the sign came on, and she hasn't tried any other T words yet!! And it's American Sign Language, so she'll be able to communicate with anyone who knows ASL.
I don't know how I'd get along as the mother of a toddler unless we were signing -- she tells me when she wants to eat, or drink, or go for a walk, or have a banana... or when she's thinking about her Daddy, or sees a squirrel, or hears a dog or a bird... It really helps us to get conversations going, so she can learn more about this big world of ours and involve us in her thoughts. Definitely minimizes frustration in trying to tell us what she wants.
We've tried some other signing tapes, but these are the best. We absolutely love these well-conceived and well-produced videos, and the wonderful teacher Jo, and of course, the babies. I recommend them for anyone remotely interested in helping their child to communicate and learn at a very early age.",1066089600,4,1896,4.343661971830986

Fortunately, I had purchased another video at the same time that is wonderful! Signing Time with Alex and Leah is the video I reccomend to everyone who is interested in teaching their children sign language. I would even reccomend it to an adult who wants to learn!!!

Ever since I introduced this tape to her, she has been signing ever since. Now it is much easier to understand her. She loves to watch the tape over and over again. She especially likes the way the tape features many other children with props as examples in introducing each particular word. The tape features the categories and things that go along with dressing up, food, animals, playtime and transportation. I would recommend See n' Sign to anyone. My daughter is happier knowing that she can communicate better with me. It has also promoted her speech. I love this tape and so will you.",1064188800,5,762,4.610294117647059

I am so excited that I played this for my 13 month old and she started to sign on her own!  Now she uses the more sign all the time, its so cute... If you are looking for lots and lots of signs to communicate to your baby, toddler or pre-schooler, the Baby See N Sign video set is just the BEST! I am having such a great time learning to sign these basic ASL signs along with my daughter! We are having such a ball discovering something new and useful TOGETHER! I'm sure that when she starts actually talking she will always be quite expressive with her hands! I am ordering the second vido too and I will have the categories/words covering everything a parent can think of such as: Lets Get Dressed, Food, Chow Time, Play Time, Animal Pals, Down on the Farm, Away We Go, Familiar Faces and Places, Outdoors, Zoo Friends, Party Time, My Body, Bath Time and Nighty-Night. The signs are clear, without obstruction (words don't even appear over the signer, and the pictures used are engaging) Also all the images reinforce the words/signs three different times. Its obvious there was much planning that went into word selection and presentation by the company/producer. Thanks for giving me and my kids a new hobby (ages 6,4 and 1)! (it is cute to see my 6 year old saying she knows how to sign, and practising along as well!)  I hope you enjoy it if you choose it for your home! -- Shannon Vyff",1060646400,9,1417,4.425287356321839
173738,4,0971366306,"While this is a very good video, many of the signs are made at the BOTTOM of the screen and they are hard to see what she is doing.  The signs SHOULD always be made in the line of sight, or at the main focal point - the center of the screen.
Also they frequently fail to incorporate the appropriate activity or object in the picture, they just have the lady standing there saying a word and signing it.  For an adult, or older child that is fine, but boring.  A baby needs the object or activity, along with the spoken and signed word.  But, overall, compared to most of this type of video available, it is good.  I got spoiled with ""Talking Hands"" video, and wish others were as well done.",1059955200,4,690,4.196969696969697

We have enjoyed practicing new words each week and Evan is thrilled everytime we both speak a new word to each other. I can also see the satisfaction on his face when I can actually give him exactly what he's asking for, without having to rule everything else out first. I'm particularly grateful that he can tell me when he wants more food or when he's done. He use to hurl his food on the floor when he was finished eating so now I have a much cleaner floor. I'm only left wanting to learn more, like ""please"" and ""thank you"", so I'm excited to see volume II coming out (which is now available on the original web sight).

I thought this video gave not only the basics, but many signs I had never seen before. I also liked the speed at which they were presented, not too slow, not too fast. I can't wait for the next one so I can expand my baby vocabulary and my son's too. At 11-months old, he tries to sign the words and say them as he hears them repeated over and over.

173747,5,0971366306,"I began using sign language with my son when he was about 10 months old. One day, before he was even 11 months old and still not talking, he was obviously feeling irritable. At that point, as was the whole first year, my husband and I could only guess why he was feeling uncomfortable, and do our best to try to comfort him. But on this particular day, he surprised us when he signed hurt and pointed to his mouth. Wow! For the first time our baby could actually tell us what was wrong. He was teething....and it hurt! Now, without guessing, we could take the steps we felt were needed in order to make him feel better. This is only one example of how signing with your child is beneficial to both you and your child.
Baby See n' Sign is a great resource for parents. The video introduces the viewer to American Sign Language (ASL). Unlike some vocabulary videos that only present between 10-30 words, this 45 minute video presents OVER 60!! The words are broken down into categories that will reflect day-to-day things and activities in your child's life. The signs, which are repeated numerous times, are presented with corresponding images, as well as the spoken and written word. Both my son and I enjoy the video. He has actually been able to pick-up signs from the video that I have not even used with him myself.
I feel it is most important to mention that this video accurately demonstrates the use of ASL signs. I have found that many sign language resources either are not teaching ASL or they are introducing signs modified for babies. Though I do feel that it is fine for babies to simplify the signs, I find it important to begin by knowing and introducing the correct way to perform the sign, just as you would with spoken vocabulary. This video shows the correct sign which allows the parent or child to modify the sign if desired or needed.
Though this video is intended for children,I feel it is also a great resource for anyone, adult or child, interested in learning ASL.
My son, who is now 22 months old, knows over 150 signs that he uses regularly with his spoken vocabulary. The fact that he knows sign language has increased our ability to communicate with each other and has aided us in better understanding his spoken words. Often, if I do not understand what he is trying to say, I ask him for the sign. That always clarifies things. He even uses sign when he is playing alone with his toys. I have seen him speaking for and with his stuff animals - apparently they know sign too!",1033516800,11,2506,4.485776805251641

This was no exception.  So, by the time we ate dinner that night, we all could show Daddy several signs.  My children are ages 10, 6, 4, and 16 months.  We have enjoyed learning together and signing with the youngest especially.  It is so exciting when she signs to us and people are amazed(some had said that babies couldn't really learn to sign--which is apparently a wrong assumption!).
