310901,5,6301133471,"This version of ""Pinocchio"" was created by Rankin/Bass, the same people, who produced ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" which originally aired in the 60's. This classic should be released on DVD by itself. Great Christmas classic with a great moral! Buy it today!",1285891200,,264,5.309523809523809
310902,4,6301133471,"PLOT: Pinnocchio is told about Christmas by Gepetto, who gives him an early present. Pinnochio sells it to buy a present for Gepetto, and along the way gets caught lying. The bad Fox and Cat trick him into burying his money to grow a tree of silver and gold. Pinnochio goes to work in a puppet show, and rescues a girl puppet, then hides in the enchanted woods. Pinnochio lands up at the North Pole, teaching toys how to dance. Later the Fox and Cat sell him as a present to a rich Duke for his kids, and when Pinnochio learns that the busy Duke only spends 3 minutes with his kids on Christmas he makes him change his ways.

BACKGROUND INFO: This show is a 1 hour TV special that first aired on ABC on December 3, 1980. Made 16 years after Rudolph, the technical ability of the studio Animimagic stop motion work made the action more life-like than ever before. For one thing the puppets themselves are better made than ever before, and the stop-motion is more fluid than any other show they had made before. Pinnocho is voiced by Ted Porter. The cricket is voiced by Robert McFadden, who did other work for the studio. George Irving as Gepetto, Alan King as the voice of Maestro.  Allen Swift, Diane Leslie, and Pat Bright also lend their voices. Written by Romeo Muller. The music is by Maury Laws, who wrote the music for Rudolph and many other shows. While Jules Bass wrote the lyrics for many of the specials, the lyrics this time were by Julian Gardener. Character design was by Paul Coker Jr. who did the design for most of the shows from Rankin/Bass, both cel animated and animagic. He did all the characters for 'Year Without a Santa Claus' for example.

If you are a Rankin/Bass fan, give this title a chance, it's better than it sounds. It is loaded with 7 songs including, ""Gonna Get lucky, Knock on Wood""; I Never Know What Gifts to Buy, Do You?""; ""The Very Best Friend I Ever Had""; ""Let 'Em Laugh""; ""It's the Truth""; ""The Perfect Gift for Christmas Day""; and ""Dancin'"", surely the best song in the special.

Their studio has brought us such memorable holiday classics such as Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, Mad Monster Party, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Mouse on the Mayflower, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, Jack Frost, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit, Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, 95% of the ones we see every year. Their work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that have been released on DVD.",1171065600,,2870,4.62156862745098

310904,5,6301133471,"This movie is painfully awful... but you can't stop watching it!  It all boils down to the dancing song.  I can't stop laughing every time I hear it!  If you're into B rated movies, this is definitely your flick!  I've had this movie for almost two years and I still can't stop watching it.",1129420800,2,290,4.314814814814815
310905,5,6301133471,"This is the story of everyone's favorite wooden boy who's having his first Christmas.  Things go very well, until Pinocchio goes to a puppet show to try and earn money for presents, and when he doesn't, he meets some girl the apple of his eye whose name is Julietta.  Pinocchio steals Julietta from the puppet master and brings her to the forest of enchantment in hopes that someday she will come to life.  While he and Julietta are having fun in the forest, a white glow comes and makes Pinocchio unconscious.  Then the blue fairy brings him and Julietta to her throne room and Pinocchio tells her how he began to meet Julietta.  Later on in the movie Pinocchio's wish about Julietta being alive comes true.
This movie, and Princess Mononoke are two state of perfection and promote good values, such as honor and love.",1007942400,7,819,4.620689655172414
310906,5,6301133471,"Filmed in Rankin/Bass's uncomparable stop-motion animation technique, ""Animagic"", this lesser-known special ranks right up there with ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"". Tricked by a mean fox and dim-witted cat, Pinocchio loses the money he planned to use to buy Pappa Gepetto a Christmas present (which he obtained by selling the arithmetic book Gepetto bought him). This begins a series of very amusing adventures. The Pinocchio character is so cute in this show....he's very mischievous but very lovable. Another colorful and warm special from R/B.",1007510400,4,585,5.511111111111111

7809574,5,6301133471,A beautiful animated Christmas story even for adults. I wish this was available on DVD.,1518739200,,87,4.866666666666666
7809575,4,6301133471,My husband is obsessed with this movie and you cannot find it anywhere. I was so excited to buy it for his stocking but when it arrived I realized a made a dumb mistake. This is VHS and we do not own a VCR. Who does these days? I was ready to return it but my husband found out about it and asked to keep it anyway. It was only $10 and he was touched at the thought. I am trying to find a way to convert it to DVD if possible. Shipping was fast. The only issue was my own mistake.,1514851200,,480,3.715686274509804
7809576,2,6301133471,"In spite of some excellent animation and voice work, this is the bottom of the Christmas barrel.  The story is bizarre and meanders all over the place, deftly and not-so-deftly trying to avoid a potential lawsuit from Disney, whose well-known version strays far from the original source material and is clearly the inspiration for this special (see also the unwatchable Filmation project ""Snow White's Christmas"").  The songs are patently lousy and mostly seem to pop up randomly in the story bringing the plot to a screeching halt, including a head-scratching number where Pinocchio dreams of being at Santa's Workshop at the North Pole and teaching the toys and reindeer to dance.  Rankin/ Bass enthusiasts with a sharp eye may note a few re-used props and characters from the far superior classics Santa Claus is Coming to Town and The Year Without a Santa Claus.  I recommend just watching or re-watching those specials instead of plodding through this dreck.  There is a clear reason this one has been largely forgotten.",1511481600,,1025,5.041420118343195

7809582,4,6301133471,"If I had to pick a favorite version of Pinocchio other than the Disney version, this would definitely be it! It's another Rankin/Bass christmas special, starring everyone's favorite talking marionette. I like how this featurette mixes a bit of the original fairy tale into a ""Christmas Adventure"". Pinocchio in this one is not quite as lovable or innocent as the Disney version, mostly because he is partially sassy, but he does apologize for most of his wrongdoings. The cricket is a little more sassy too in a funny way. I kind of like how we see a back story as to how Pinocchio came to life like he did in the fairy tale. I am glad Maestro Fire Eater the puppeteer is antagonistic but in no way as evil like Stromboli. The fox and the cat, however....eh, not quite interesting. The songs, well three of them are pretty good. ""Knock on wood"" has a memorable beat, and ""Dancin'"" is very catchy. ""Put your love"" is very sweet too. The others, um not  really bad, just forgettable. In addition, this special has two very strong parts. One is Pinocchio falls in live with Julietta, that's cute and sweet. The other is when Pinocchio convinces the Duke to show his live for Christmas. The Duke always neglects his children, but Pinocchio teaches him that Christmas is about loving your family. What a selfless act! I do wish Pinocchio became a real boy in this one instead of the foreshadow, but that's a nitpick. On the whole, I really enjoy this one. "" Pinocchio's Christmas"" stays close to the book, but stays family friendly and holds the magic of Christmas. I enjoyed watching it, and I'll be seeing it plenty more times in future Christmases.",1386460800,,1646,4.636986301369863
