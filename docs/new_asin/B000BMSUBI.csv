2424059,5,B000BMSUBI,"Hey there!  Lauren here.  I LOVE Avatar: The Last Airbender and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new and exciting to watch.  It's dramatic, suspenseful and very enjoyable to watch.  It's full of adventure as well.

In a time when the world is divided into four nations:  Water tribes, earth kingdoms, fire nation and air nomads, it seems peaceful.  But that all changes when the greedy and power hungry fire nation starts a war with the other three nations.  The world's only hope is the Avatar, a boy who can master the bending disciplines of all four elements.  But he hasn't been seen for a hundred years.  It's not until a waterbender named Katara and her annoying older brother, Sokka, free Aang from an iceburg, do they uncover the world's last hope.  Now it's up to Aang to learn all four bending disciplines in order to end the war and bring balance back to the world.  With the help of Katara and Sokka, Aang will learn a lot more than the bending arts. He will learn what true friendship is.

Water, earth, fire air.

Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony

Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked

Only the Avatar, master of all four elements could stop them

But when the world needed him most, he vanished

A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar.  An airbender named Aang.  And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone

But I believe, Aang can save the world

Join Katara, her annoying brother, Sokka and their friend, Aang, as they make their way to the North Pole in search of a waterbending teacher for Katara.  Also, As the Avatar, Aang must master all four elements in order to defeat the fire lord and restore balance to the world.

I've been watching this show for nine months now and I LOVE it.  Katara is my favorite character and I believe Mae Whitman portrays her really well.  I LOVE this show and I can't wait till it comes to DVD.  Like Katara, my element is also water.  I identify with Katara the most.

May the power of water, earth, fire and air be with everyone always.",1132099200,11,2137,4.477922077922078
2424060,5,B000BMSUBI,"I like this show a lot, and watch it with my 5-year old daughter, who loves it. She talks about being a ""leafbender"" when we're raking and piling leaves :-)

Does anyone know how many episodes are in this ""book 1, vol 1""? It says it has a running time of only 90 minutes, so it can't be the whole first season. Is it only the first three episodes? If so, I wish we could get the whole first season. And in time for Christmas, too!",1132012800,4,430,4.0
2424061,5,B000BMSUBI,"At First when I would see commercials for this show I rolled my eyes and thought - ""oh no!  more anime?!""  I consider myself more in the 'older' generation of Nickelodeon viewers - Rocko's Modern Life, Doug, etc, even though I do enjoy Spongebob, Danny Phantom, and Fairly odd Parents, so I didn't really want to give this show a chance - I thought Nickelodeon was just doing the 'popular anime' thing...

Eventually I came around and watched an Episode of Avatar, and I'm so glad I did!  This show is done extremely well, with more research, time, and effort put in to it than any other I have seen!  It's the kind of show that you really get into - one of those 'escapist' type shows where you forget about everything else, and feel like you are in Aang's world.  I even feel like I want to 'bend' sometimes...well, actually, I feel like this ALL the time!

The story is amazing, and so well thought out.  The characters are well developed, especially one of my favorites: Prince Zuko.  At first, he is depicted as a bratty teen with a bad temper - nothing more than another 'bad guy.'  You soon begin to discover more about his persona, and how he came to be, and you actually start to feel for him.

There is a good mix of humor, action, and heart felt-emotion with this show.  Nick does a good job - in a way - of 'spoofing' anime style drawing, while respecting it.  This is especially evident with the facial expressions used on the characters.

I can't say enough about this show!  I've seen every episode, and can't wait for the new one's to come out.  I'll definitely be buying this DVD.  Give it a chance sometime, I'm really glad I did!",1131753600,8,1648,4.3861386138613865
2424062,5,B000BMSUBI,w00t avatar is leik teh uber sweet lol BUY THIS DVD it will be so awesome lol i have not seen eps 1 + 2 so i wiil when i buy this rofl AVATAR RULES it is lol and sweet MAD SWEET LOL if you don't buy this YOU R MISSING OUT LOLOLOL,1131667200,,229,3.339622641509434
2424063,5,B000BMSUBI,"Who would have thought that a cartoon would become the one and only show that no one in our family wants to miss?  Of course Avatar is much more sophisticated than Bugs Bunny or Spongebob.

The characters are unique and well-developed.  The story is compelling.  The setting is a blend of Asian cultures and magic.  It shows the best in people overcoming the worst situations with grace and humor.  And it's exciting...  battles fought on land, air and water.

Each show moves the story along a little further toward the ultimate conclusion -- which I hope is a very long time in coming!

Highly, highly recommended for all ages.",1130976000,5,629,4.697247706422019
2424064,5,B000BMSUBI,"When I first heard about this show, I wasn't sure about it.  I thought it might be another Nick show not worth watching, but my brother talked me into watching it, and I fell in love with it!  The story is so unique and different that I was drawn in right away.  I've kept tabs on the show from the beginning, and I record and watch all the new episodes when they come out.  I can't wait for the seasons to start coming out.  I love this show and can't wait to see the whole first book (water) through.  I can't wait to see how this show ends too!  It's gonna be good!  I just hope Nick doesn't take forever to make new episodes like they usually do.

One of my favorite episodes is when Aang and the gang meet the fortune teller and Katara is told about a ""powerful bender"" that she will marry one day.  At the end of the episode, her brother says, ""Man, that's one powerful bender,"" referring to Aang, of course.  And Katara has this awesome look on her face!  It's Aang of course who is the ""powerful bender.""  But I guess we'll see!

This is show is great, and I highly recommend it to anyone of all ages!  I'm 19 and love this show!",1130889600,5,1137,4.1045454545454545

2424083,5,B000BMSUBI,"I watched this show from the premiere of the first episode. I remember having to wait about a year and a half to watch the premier of the 3rd season. I am so glad that this show was a part of my childhood.

I'm older now, but I would recommend this show to anyone who is worthy. The plot is distinct but also simple to follow, even if you pick a random episode (but I recommend starting from the top). The characters are authentically conflicted. The music corresponds very well with the show, and the principles portrayed by the protagonists are positive and  meditative.",1493856000,,572,4.490384615384615

2424117,5,B000BMSUBI,"Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the best animated series ever.  The story brings you into an imaginary world with distinctive Asian-flavored tribes and philosophies, and complex characters with changing goals, motivations and beliefs over the course of the series.

In this middle part of the trilogy (like practically all second chapters of a trilogy) there are adventures and character development that are somewhat of a lull between the beginning and end.  But I think this part is nonetheless important in setting up themes needed for the final season.",1486166400,,560,5.2

You will fall in love with the characters. The themes of coming-of-age and friendship are so natural, not heavy handed, but just plain GOOD! And the end is PERFECT.

The characters, story, storytelling, world-building, artwork (especially colors//lighting), delicate handling of some pretty gritty things--EVERYTHING is masterful. And kid-friendly (I don't think my 4yo could properly appreciate its themes and subtleties just yet, but I'm not opposed to him seeing it).

2424208,5,B000BMSUBI,"This show appeals to any age group and truly highlights the importance of building friendships with people who come from different backgrounds than ourselves. I appreciate how the program incorporates various strengths of the differing tribes/nations (water, air, fire, and earth) and I'm extremely appreciative of how it highlights the strengths of those who experience disabilities. For example, It shows that although Toph is blind she proves to be the best earth bender the world has ever seen. Again, the show has the ability to encourage people to build relationships with others and to accept them for who they are. This is by far one of THE best cartoons ever!!! It's my favorite ",1484524800,,688,5.088495575221239

2424220,5,B000BMSUBI,"Season 2 of ATLA is even better than Book 1: Water; not that the first season was bad (it was mind-blowingly good) but thanks to Book 2, we get introduced to a plethora of some amazing new characters who's personalities are truly great.
The story continues strong. Rather than take some bizarre unnecessary plummet after an exceptional beginning, Book 2 comes in with a bang and keeps that initial momentum on a constant rise. With new cast members, new techniques, new scenery, and insight on the internal struggles of the gang and the new characters, the audience remains thoroughly entertained by this engrossing next chapter.
You fall in love with the new players, and even more so with the original gang as you watch them go through the roller coaster fate has put them on; as well as anxious for their futures. In other words, prepare to become seriously fandom obsessed. Because yes, the new season is just that good.
Onward (in a more serious voice! ->) The wonderful thing about this season is that you develop so much hope for things to come through foreshadows, the plot, the entire cast, and personalities you're so fond of. Rather than breeze through in the want to just ""get it over with"" you want to really take it in and marinate on every episode. Between life lessons, battles, and twists, this season brings a lot to the table (or should I say Pi Sho table?? Ha ha get it?! It's okay Sokka would)
Book 2: Earth is exactly like the element it's named after: strong, powerful, and enthralling.",1484265600,,1509,4.676691729323308

I've recommended this show to several people based on its great animation and artistic styling, its wonderful use of humor, its well thought out and enthralling story line, its lovable but flawed characters, as well as its incorporation of various martial arts styles.

2424373,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is easily the best children's show!  It teaches kids about honor, loyalty, courage, love, kindness, justice, inner strength.  There are no stupid, fashion-frenzied girls, no situations that are inappropriate for little kids to see, no gore, no bad language.  This is a show that you can sit down and watch with your kids because it is so engaging.  The characters do not always make the right decisions, but they learn (the right) lessons.  Disrespect, greed, selfishness, vanity, cowardice, dishonesty, pride are all dealt with as wrong, not understandable, or acceptable in certain situations...
The protagonists are all children from age 10-16, and they act like it.  But they learn to survive, and pursue good in a very hostile and difficult world.  Yet, despite the serious topics and situations, there is light-hearted humor that keeps it from being depressing.  And there are certainly tear-jerker parts, but it's not cheap sensationalism and emotional garbage that does it (like Pokmon), it's true loss, real suffering, self-sacrifice, glory, reunion joy, and the vindication of right.",1481328000,10,1098,5.343023255813954

2424424,5,B000BMSUBI,"Okay, sense there are tons and tons of reviews for this series that give it endless praise, I will try and keep it brief when I tell you about my extreme love for the series. First of all, the plot in this story is great. I'm not going to be saying any spoilers in this review about the show, but can I just say... the plot is pretty impressive. It's complex, interesting and pretty easy to follow at the same time. Also, there's not many plot holes at all, which is always good. Second of all, the music in the show is great as well. Throughout the series, we often hear enchanting drum melodies playing in the background or at the end credits. The drum beats were amazing and well put together, just like all of the other music in the show. Next, we have to talk about the characters. Once again, I have to say that the character development and originality here is also great. In the show, we have deeper, more interesting characters that are well rounded and thought out. So, basically what I'm trying to say is, the characters in Avatar aren't just your stereotypical, 2 dimensional teenagers that you see in almost every other movie. They are much more interesting (and fun) to watch than that. Next, we of course have to talk about the art and animation in the show. Oh gosh- the animation and art is so good! Throughout the entire series, we have had complex, detailed backgrounds, nicely drawn characters and great animation. What more can you have than that? Oh yeah, there actually is one more thing that you can have, and that thing is great voice actors! Yep, the voice actors in this show are great, too. Just to list off a couple voice actors that worked on the show, we have Azula's voice actor as Grey Griffin, (The gal who voiced Daphne in Scooby-Doo) and Fire Lord Ozai, who is voiced by Mark Hamill. (Yes- the Mark Hamill from Star Wars).
So there you have it, folks! Pretty much every good aspect a show needs to have- Avatar has! This show is just downright phenomenal, and I would recommend it to any child or adult alike.",1480377600,12,2045,4.441489361702128

It takes place in a world with as much history, imagination and depth as Westeros or Middle Earth. Of the three seasons, season 2 or Book 2: Earth is my favorite; especially the amazing episode Tales of Ba Sing Se. If you like action, fantasy, coming of age tales, super heroes, redemption tales, or just plain good ol story telling, than do yourself a favor and watch Avatar: The Last Airbender.",1476230400,,557,4.470588235294118

The major players begin to recognize and take hold of their respective destinies as the world waits for Avatar Aang to meet his incredible potential and lead the world out of a century of war.

If you aren't a huge fan of Season 1, I don't think you lose much starting with this season. There's a lot of good stuff here that flows well into the final season.",1475366400,,458,4.264367816091954

2424620,5,B000BMSUBI,"I love the series first of all because it is a whole. So many series try to milk the series to death leading to it just dying suddenly without closure. Avatar the Last Airbender is deep for anime and keeps an adult as well as children entertained. Great plot, characters and artwork. It is only surpassed narrowly by the sequel The Legend of Korra in my opinion. I  now want to see more! :)",1474329600,,390,4.27027027027027
2424621,5,B000BMSUBI,"In my opinion, it's better than the first season. It continues the story very well, and you can tell that the creators thought the plot through until the very end. You learn so much more about the Avatar, as well as Zuko, not just Aang. The story builds and definitely does not disappoint.",1474329600,,289,4.471698113207547

2424625,5,B000BMSUBI,"I wasn't a fan at the very beginning, but the further I got into the show, the better it got.  It turned out to be one of my favorite shows!  I definitely recommend watching it.",1474329600,,177,4.0285714285714285
2424626,5,B000BMSUBI,"I'm writing this after revisiting the series and watching it a second time.  The second season of Avatar: The Last Airbender is incredibly affecting.  The first time I pushed through this series, I mostly found myself impressed by the fight scenes and animation style.  This last go-round, however, I find myself regretting the fact that I did not pay more attention to the characters and the writing.
  I recall liking the Zuko and Iroh sections of the show the first time, but this latest viewing has me appreciating Iroh even more.  There was a scene with Iroh in Season Two that had me in tears.  (For the record, I consider myself to be jaded, rolling my eyes at even live-action drama scenes.)  And, of course, this season includes the introduction of Toph (which, by the way, is an EXCELLENT episode!), the exploration of past Avatar lives, and the grand city of Ba Sing Se.  All of these are reasons enough to pay special attention to this show's second season.  The real treasure of Book 2, though, is in the characters and how they are handled throughout.
  So... if you find yourself on the fence about watching Book Two after being less than impressed with Book One, I encourage you to at least stay with Aang and the crew until they get to Ba Sing Se.  If you're still not convinced that this series is must-watch television, maybe you should quit television altogether?",1474243200,8,1383,4.6652892561983474

2424786,5,B000BMSUBI,"I don't even know how to review this... I'm over 40, and while I first found this series back when my step-daughter was 9 and looking for an exciting fantasy series upholding values of compassion and friendship, with strong female characters and lots of magic...  I was immediately hooked myself.  So was my husband! This series is all of the above, but also just an awesome, rollicking good tale.  In the first season it stuck very close to that sort Joseph Campbellian, Star Warsian, epic journey storytelling strategy (which I loved, Loved LOVED), but in Season 2 it began to diverge just slightly and became more unique, more unexpected and more memorable.  It was maybe a little less satisfying, because of that.  I think I've been trained to expect the storytelling archetypes, so I guess I missed some of those elements. Of course, they still gave us the bittersweet, season-ending cliffhanger a la Empire Strikes Back!
In the end, Season 2 is the season I remember best, except for the finale of Season 1.  Just can't recommend it highly enough, regardless of age.",1469923200,9,1072,4.830601092896175

2424868,5,B000BMSUBI,"Avatar The Last Airbender did everything right, the animation is incredible, the is writing perfect and, the characters are all to real. It even stayed on the air for just the right amount of time, not ending to soon, making you feel unsatisfied, or staying on too long, dragging out a story beyond what was necessary.
In short, Avatar is the kind of show that someone can say they don't like, but no one can say they think it's bad.

Season 2 continues the epic tale of Avatar, with the character's growth and, the ever changing world becoming evermore obvious.",1468972800,,562,4.62

I love, love, love all the Avatar: Last Airbender seasons. I started watching it when I was pregnant. Continued on til he was born, while I nurse. TMI. Back to point. This show is awesome not just coz it's an anime. I'm not even into that. But because it has everything, every story, every human emotion possible. As one reviewer said. It transcends beyond the exterior, the streotypical anime over the top, over kill (sometimes) plots. This one makes you feel what the characters must feel. It makes you happy, sad, joy, excited, mad, just *sigh* Very, very good storyline that can be translated into the now moment and every day struggle. Just watch it and see for yourself. You will love it. I promise.",1465603200,,814,4.493243243243243

2425092,5,B000BMSUBI,"What can be said? This is still a terrific and deeply emotional series that should be approached with the intention (if they ever make another live action movie of the idea), of not trying to do everything, but trying to do the right thing and respect what was done with an eye on advancing the story and making it exciting in the first and second and third places. The template of good solid story telling is in place, and what is there should make any live action filmmaker understand that they are not going to improve it. That said, this is a nice second chapter in the gang's story and filled with growth and development.
Avatar: The Last Airbender is good TV on any level and should be approached with humor and good common sense that you will be taken on a terrific ride.",1465516800,,778,4.409722222222222

2425349,5,B000BMSUBI,"My 7 year old nephew got hooked on this series and we watch it together.  The second season rocked and rolled like the first, further developing the characters and moving the story forward.
We really like this.  It's got action, adventure, heroics, conflict, suspense, plenty of excitement, and diverse voices.  It's great for kids and the care givers who wish for them to absorb some ""good nutrition"" while watching television -- and want to be able to share the viewing experience without our heads exploding from the typical gratuitous weirdness, violence, and general inanity of some stuff made for kids.
Highly recommended for pre-tweens and tweens and maybe even young teens.",1462406400,,681,5.117117117117117

2425355,5,B000BMSUBI,"For an animated (anime) series, this is the best I've ever experienced. The dialogue is clever, and also can be enjoyed by adults. The themes extend far beyond the obvious. Watching one episode will leave you wanting more - the series episodes are all tied together in some way, and present a progression right to the dramatic end. The characters are engaging and interesting/funny/unique. The cinematography is excellent and well thought out - and much like Star Wars or any really good series, there are recurring characters/themes/undertones that unify the plots.  I can watch this again and again, and never get bored with it.  It is also capable of evoking extreme emotion - but to discover where that is, you'll have to watch the series - enjoy.",1462406400,,751,4.905511811023622

We also see him face off against some very difficult enemies, leading to an epic battle at the end of the season that nicely sets up Season three.

I didn't manage to catch every episode, but whenever it was on it would definitely grab my attention. Now I'm 26 and I'm watching the entire series with my grandmother. She absolutely loves this show, and so do I.

This season is when the show starts to transition from being a more childish humor based show to taking a more serious tone. There is still a lot of humor and charm that was in the first season, but every episode manages to move the plot forward in a significant way, more so than season 1.",1454457600,,793,4.286666666666667

Hands-down the best cartoon/anime show I've ever seen for its character development, addressing of humanitarian issues, exploration of self-confidence and growing psychologically through struggles, and a depth of plot-line and story development rarely seen in shows for younger kids.

2426286,5,B000BMSUBI,"The entire Avatar series is one of the best television shows marketed to young adults that I've ever seen.  Unlike most people, I didn't watch it when it was new (in fact, I've only just watched it in the last month), nor was I young enough to be in the intended demographic when it was new.  However, it is fortunate that the intended demographic is just that.  Intended.  Not limited to, by any means.

Most shows marketed to children or young adults are done so because the show is purposely designed with just enough depth to draw them in, and then enough flashing colors, sounds, and silliness that they stick around and watch more.  Avatar is far more than that (although, that's not to say that it isn't a vibrantly colored and funny experience as well).

Through the viewer's shared journeys with Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Iroh, and even the cast-out Prince Zuko, they're taught a myriad of important life lessons that I truly believe everyone, adults included (perhaps especially), need to learn.  Even the ones that they already know are not only beneficial when seen from a new point of view, but they're genuinely good, clean fun when experienced through the adventures of Aang and company.

I can not recommend this show more for viewers of any age.",1453507200,8,1263,4.730593607305936

2426572,5,B000BMSUBI,"The second season continues the high standard set by the first. Same quality animation, acting, and production, and we're introduced to the fourth (human) main cast member. This season sees a lot of character development, especially for Aang, who is forced to confront his personal shortcomings, and worries of failure in upholding the Avatar's legacy.

Lots of great interaction between the main cast here as well, as their friendships deepen, develop, and are challenged.

Probably my favorite part of this season is the parts devoted to further developing Zuko as a character. It's wonderfully well done, and fantastically paced as we watch him loose a bit of his rigidity, and confront his own failings. Uncle Iroh continues to be a joy.",1447200000,,741,5.115702479338843

Beyond that, the art is lovely, the animation and voice work is flawless.  It's entertaining visually, intellectually and will tickle your wit with overt humor as well as more subtle giggles.  It's a must see, but start from the beginning and watch all the seasons in order.  It is an unfolding story and the characters grow and change throughout.

As a 30 year old adult watching for this series for the first time way after it was popular, I am simply amazed at the humor, depth and development this series continued to pull off flawlessly. Not only are there several great laugh out loud moments, but the show has many heavy emotional episodes, especially around the halfway mark of this season. I could go on and on about the great animation, action, character development, humor, story, etc. but really, whether you have children or not, you should check this series out because it is arguably one of the greatest animated series to be made.",1440201600,,773,4.819548872180451

2427424,5,B000BMSUBI,"Must say, this is my second run through the entire series and I still absolutely loved it. Granted, there were some episodes that I know the outcome, and aren't as climactic as others, but still there is always a joke to be heard that is still funny, or a message from Aang that is worth hearing again.
To all those who have never watched this please be ready - This is a kids' show! It's notably evident in the earlier episodes. As the show progresses, you will start noticing more adult situations and problems dealing with internal conflict that especially adults could relate to; it's probably the part that a child might find most boring, but you will find most interesting.  As the story progresses further, you will soon notice a seamless balance of enough to satisfy the children, but also plenty to keep you glued.
Not to spoil it, but give yourself the honor of watching the whole show through. You will never regret it!",1438905600,,930,4.602409638554217

In keeping with the Star Wars motif, this one was much more of the ilk of The Empire Strikes Back in that the good guys end the season and appear to have lost. The introduction of Toph Bei Fong as a character is a very fun portion to the series as well as the struggles that we see Zuko go through in discovering himself. Obviously, Aang has his own soul searching to do, with this being the season with the Guru and Appa being lost to him, which is very well written and interesting to watch. Love the series and this season, though it is tough to compare it to the other seasons so as to decide which is best.",1437436800,,649,4.078125

The characters are engaging,  imperfect and remarkably deep for what is ostensibly a children's animated program. We're in to the 3rd season and no one has been killed on-screen, so you don't have to worry about characters skewering and chopping each other with jian, a type of Chinese long sword.

I didn't actually watch it all that much until the end of season 2 and season 3, but after that, it was jsut a wait until I could watch it all from the beginning again and again. To be honest, the first season is a little bit slow, but it picks right up in what is arguably my favorite season of the series.

If you even partially enjoy this series, I would also suggest Legend of Korra, which is set in the same universe about 70 years later. It's set in a 1920 NYC, Hong Kong, Tokyo, San Francisco, type city. I prefer that show, as I  was more able to connect with the characters in it.",1427155200,,634,4.023809523809524

2428576,5,B000BMSUBI,"It is a really long season. But it is enjoyable to see so much of the world. I also enjoyed watching these characters evolve throughout this season. Some of the episodes were fillers, but even a few of the fillers helped develop the characters and made me care for them more.",1421625600,,275,4.411764705882353
2428577,3,B000BMSUBI,"Season 2 was still good, but unfortunately I felt it was quite a bit worse than season 1.
Spoilers below.

What I liked:
- A lot of focus on Iroh, one of my favorite characters ever
- Nice story arc for Appa, another awesome character
- Toph was a great new addition to the cast.
- Introduction of Blue firebending
- Flashbacks in episode Zuko Alone are fantastic
- Nice continuity, return of old characters
- Continued humor, though unfortunately less than season 1.
- Art is still good.

What I didn't like:
- I thought Zuko was lame in the previous season, but that was nothing compared to how lame he is in this season. In season 2 he doesn't even try to attack the Avatar or do much of anything, really.  He just wanders around in a ""morally conflicted"" state doing nothing except ignoring the wise words of Iroh.  I was hoping this would all be building up to a character change, but the finale just reinforced his incredible stubbornness and stupidity. A real letdown.

- Too much time in Ba Sing Se.  It's a great location and I'm glad we spent time there, but spending 8 episodes there? Just too much.  This series works best when the heroes are traveling together.

- Nonexistent presence of the Fire Nation.  In season one the gang was constantly fighting massive Fire Nation armies.  This season, they face a major fire nation army exactly once.

- Lame adversaries.  Instead of the Fire Nation military, this season the main enemies are three Fire Nation girls. One holds back because she has a crush on Sokka, one is too pampered and lazy to do much of anything. The last, Azula, is more formidable, but she only pops up to fight from time to time and can be beaten in combat fairly easily. Her motivation is totally unclear, it's also unclear why almost no one ever tries to double-cross her. Her plans seem complex but are actually pretty simple, her main power seems to be convincing others to do her bidding. How she manages to do this is pretty mystifying, the series want us to believe people follow her just because she can give a good speech (Huh?).  Unlike others, I didn't find her to be a very compelling villain, especially acting all by herself without any army.

- Despite spending such a long time in Ba Sing Se, we never get a clear account of what happened to Iroh and his son there, which was the one burning question I had about the place.  We can guess of course, but this seems like such a missed opportunity.

- A surprisingly tired and unexciting tale of a puppet head of state and government conspiracy.  This is supposed to be the climax of the season but falls super flat.

- Big plot holes that are impossible to overlook:

  * The gang decides not to march on the Fire Nation since Aang's avatar state only activates when he is in true distress, they can't force it to activate, and he's too weak to win without using it.  Um, what?  Wouldn't being attacked by a bunch of firebenders be enough to cause him distress?

 * The gang goes through a lot of trouble to find King Bumi, only to have him give a very lame excuse that he wants to remain locked up to gain control from the inside.  The gang accepts this, lets him go, and we don't hear from him again.  Um, what?

 * Waterbenders in the swamp can bend plants, since they are mostly water?  Um, what?  So why can't waterbenders bend people, since people are mostly water?

 * There's a massive spire of an ancient library just sticking out of the sand, and no one knows about it, even the intrepid archaeologist?  And this spire is kept totally unguarded, despite the librarian wanting no one to enter?  And when our gang does arrive, he lets them through even though he knows they are lying, and then gets so mad when he gets confirmation of their deception that he destroys the whole thing?  Um, what?

 * Earthbenders can bend metal? Even though it was explicitly stated in previous episodes that they cannot? Um, what?

Despite having some good episodes and focusing on some great characters (Iroh), this season seem wandering and unfocused.  It almost seems as if the writers were struggling to come up with enough material.  3.5/5, I'll round down to counter the positive reviews.  Hope season 3 is a lot better.",1421107200,,4215,4.499341238471673

I was hoping to find my other shows too. Last Airbender is really suspenseful at times and it can be funny too.",1416355200,,252,4.270833333333333
2428703,5,B000BMSUBI,This series is a good example of what animation can do verses live action for those that may have seen the Last Airbender movie and came away let down. Check out the series that it was based on I believe you will sit through the whole series. Good story and well developed characters lite humor along with a bit of action. Over all just great stuff.,1416268800,,349,4.303030303030303

2428709,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is a well balanced cartoon. The story telling is done well. The characters aren't one dimensional even the ""bad guys"" are fun to watch.

Season 2 things really start to pick up as Ang must learn earth bending. First he must find a teacher. Zuko's character is developed more and Iroh continues to be awesome. Katara and Sokka continue along with Ang in their search for an earthbending ally.

The animation is nice. Even if the art style is a bit simplistic, it still looks nice. I would suggest that this show be watched by anyone who is a fan of cartoons/anime. As an aunt watching the series for the first time I have really enjoyed it. There is silly humor for kids, but not so much that it's annoying.",1415923200,,711,4.419847328244275

2428834,5,B000BMSUBI,This is an amazing show. Because it was on nickelodeon many people thought it was for kids. Although it is great for young children the plot and story are intricate and detailed.

2428880,5,B000BMSUBI,"I got this for my daughter -- a pretty mature age 8.  I've watched a bunch of episodes with her, and it's surprised me with how clever it is, and also how humane.  The live-action movie is atrocious -- I hated it on many levels, and a bunch of people kept telling me that the comic was much better.  This episodic cartoon apparently follows the comic.  It's one of the most emotionally complex and rich pieces I've ever seen built for children.  I do recommend parents watch this with their kids, both because it's enjoyable and also because some scenes and ideas may spark thoughtful discussions about people.  It's not that such ideas or scenes are inappropriate for kids, but they may be a little confusing without some grown-up insight.  Super show.  I've really loved it.",1407628800,,776,4.654411764705882

2428884,5,B000BMSUBI,This is such a great show!  The character development is amazing and the story just makes you want to know what comes next.  Good for the whole family.

2428891,5,B000BMSUBI,"The second season improves on all the weaknesses of the first, while at the same time continues all of the strong points fans enjoy.  The characters' personalities are better developed in the second season and this creates more interest for the viewer. A new character, Toph, joins the Avatar's gang and she is funny and compelling at the same time.  Even Prince Zuko and General Iroh are given some back story. This show is perfect for adventure loving 8 - 11 year olds, and I think that even adults will enjoy the witty humor. Looking forward to great things as the show matures into it final season.",1407196800,,602,4.616822429906542

2428897,5,B000BMSUBI,"I could go on for hours on why I love Avatar as a whole, but I can sum up my love for this season in one word: Toph! The little blind earth bender with a big personality! She brought the final key piece to team avatars dynamic!

I also think Azula made for a more threatening and fearsome villain! I also liked seeing Zuko and Iroh as even more sympathetic characters, Iroh especially makes you wish he was your wise crazy tea guzzling uncle!

Finally, the Ba Sing Se arc is an excellent example of not patronizing kids in entertainment! It stands as a fairly solid conspiracy thriller, cartoon or not! Enjoy!",1406851200,,609,4.428571428571429

The story lines are filled with lessons on love, friendship and how to lead a meaningful life.  I just can't say enough about the Avatar series.

2428934,5,B000BMSUBI,"This season is where Avatar: The Last Airbender really finds its footing and produces the best story arc of the show. We learn a lot more about the characters' motivation and backstory, we meet Toph, my favorite character in the entire series, and Aang and friends learn more about what they need to do to defeat the Fire Nation. We explore the Earth Kingdom, and fetch up in the mysterious city of Ba Sing Se, a city of walls and secrets where not everything is as it seems. But the Fire Nation is not far behind

In Season 1, things take a while to get started. Season 3 has some excellent episodes in it, but is fairly uneven. But season 2, and the latter half of Season 2 in particular, is the best of Avatar's three seasonseffectively, the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Avatar trilogy. It does have a couple of so-so episodesmost notably ""Avatar Day"" and ""The Swamp""but it gets those out of the way early on and focuses on greatness. The last half of the season is a suspenseful thrill ride with more twists than a spiral notebook, and will leave you wondering how they managed to get away with such amazing storytelling in a kids' show.",1405123200,,1141,4.45933014354067

2428942,5,B000BMSUBI,The show is very well executed. Season 3 is still the best. But each season got better than the previous.,1404604800,,105,4.3
2428943,4,B000BMSUBI,My grandson loves this video.  While there is some violence it is done to a point that is not scary.  It is a good fantasy story,1404432000,,128,3.8846153846153846
2428944,5,B000BMSUBI,My favorite episodes were in this season,1404086400,,40,4.857142857142857

2428949,5,B000BMSUBI,"We absolutely loved the Avatar series. Each season was packed with adventure. It is a great show for kids. No swearing, children learning to deal with each other and life, and love and kindness winning out in the end. Would highly recommend this series!",1403827200,,253,4.7727272727272725
2428950,5,B000BMSUBI,"The story line and animation in this cartoon series is excellent! This cartoon series teaches children about Morals and the difference between right and wrong, also it teaches children the importance of being truthful not only to others but to yourself. True this cartoon series revolves around a war and shows hatred toward one ""Tribe"" of people named the ""Fire Nation"" but it also teaches children the importance of forgiveness and that the whole of a Nation is not exactly like the few that are in charge of that Nation are with their cruelty.
I would highly recommend that you allow your children to watch the entire 3 seasons of this animated series.",1403740800,,655,4.8053097345132745

2428953,5,B000BMSUBI,"There's not much else I can add to whatever has already been said. This was a wonderful imagining of Asian infused fantasy. The creators don't skimp on character development or world-building. The plot is simple but tight. All in all, it's a wonderful story for anyone, children and adults.",1403568000,,290,4.938775510204081

2428965,5,B000BMSUBI,"Season two introduces Toth, one of my favorite characters.  Toth is a strong-willed blind girl whose attitude perfectly reelects her Earth-bending skills.  I would recommend for anyone who is interested in a serialized story.",1403308800,,225,5.588235294117647
2428966,5,B000BMSUBI,"This fabulous addition to the first season of Avatar: The Last Airbender does not disappoint. The plot thickens delightfully as we get even more depth to previous characters and the story builds. The character list expands with new villains and friends just as quirky, three dimensional and fun as those from the last season. There are even more laugh out loud moments, even more heart wrenching moments and even MORE quotable one-liners than you'd think possible to cram in to just one season of 22 minutes long  episodes. You'll love it like you love pizza, chocolate cake and saying that salad is good for you.

And yes, Toph really IS that fantastic.",1403308800,,654,4.830357142857143
2428967,5,B000BMSUBI,Season two is much more fast paced and plot driven than the 1st season and it is the season in which the characters grow the most. I would say that it is definitely the empire strikes back of the series.,1403308800,,203,4.1
2428968,5,B000BMSUBI,I love it. I looked at the entire thing and I will look at it again. Nothing beats my Avatar.,1403136000,,93,3.7

2428989,5,B000BMSUBI,This show is wonderful. Everyone in my family loves it. It is appropriate for the whole family. While there is violence there is always a message that violence should be your last resort. Only for self defense. This is the third time that we are watching the series. It is just as great now as the first time we watched it.,1402099200,,323,4.311475409836065

2428991,5,B000BMSUBI,"We are fans of the Avatar show in our home, and the kids love it.  The show is written well enough to keep adults entertained and engaged, too.  The only issue I have with the show is the introduction of Eastern thought and philosophy (trips to the spirit world, meditation, oneness of all reality, etc.).  However, that allows us to have discussions about the truth of reality, so watching the show turns into productive and important conversation.",1401926400,,449,4.805194805194805

2428994,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is easily one of the best animated shows I've ever watched. It has the perfect molding of characters, suspense, and humor. I think I watched the entire series in one week, I was hooked. And this is coming from a 29 year old. If you have kids, they need to watch it. So many of my friends who have kids say their kids love this show! Instant classic for sure.",1401753600,,363,4.126760563380282
2429005,5,B000BMSUBI,"I'm over 35 and I watched this when Nickelodeon was showing it on regular scheduled program. I thought there was a slight decrease in animation quality from Season 1 to season 2, but they are still light years ahead of other cartoons.
The story is great, and even though there are lots of action scenes, the best stories for me are the ones that talk about their struggles and how they overcome difficulties. And I love anything with Uncle Iroh in it (Mako Iwamatsu is awesome).
So if you are an adult that enjoys cartoons, this is a no-brainer recommendation.
If you enjoy great stories that are family friendly (and your kids will have as much fun as you watching this), gather around for a marathon of goodness.",1401667200,,714,4.5859375

2429009,5,B000BMSUBI,"For sci-fi/fantasy lovers, this is truly one of the greatest television series ever produced.

2429012,5,B000BMSUBI,This season somehow got ever better with characters you continue to invest in from so early in the series.  Still introducing a new character they still manage to grip immediately.,1400716800,,180,5.0
2429013,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is, bar none, one of the best children's shows ever produced. The main character, Aang, is a pacifist who must end a war. It deals with aggression, love, non-violence in the face of violence, and many more delicate topics.",1400630400,,227,4.7
2429014,5,B000BMSUBI,"Our family sat down together to watch this series.  We liked that, even as a cartoon, it had a complete story line that advanced with each episode and gathered great characters along the way.  Lots of fun for everyone in the family.",1400544000,,232,4.5

2429030,4,B000BMSUBI,"This review speaks to the streamed version of this show, and less to the show itself, which is really awesome. For some bizarre reason, the decision was made to send interlaced frames instead of progressive ones, causing annoying visual artifacts that are horribly distracting, especially if you've already seen this show without them. Interlaced frames were designed for older televisions, which, sadly, have seen their time come and go. Even owners of the vaunted Sony Trinitrons, like myself, will admit that a progressive frame is far superior when displayed on a progressive screen, like most TVs today are. It hobbles this and many other fine programs, and when progressive sources are available, it's astonishing that Amazon missed this crucial step, being at heart a technology-driven company. Disappointing, but still, very worth watching, especially if you don't mind watching it through Levelor blinds.",1399852800,,913,5.436619718309859

2429033,5,B000BMSUBI,"Since I don't have cable anymore I am always searching for TV series that I can download and enjoy even if I'm watching them all back to back. This series certainly delivered, I really enjoyed it's art, story lines, character development and dialog. It's suitable for children but definitely still enjoyable as an adult as well. Now I'm addicted, am watching the new series 'Legend of Korra' and have bought the books. Don't dismiss this because it looks like kid stuff, it really is great and gets better as it goes along too.",1399420800,,527,4.67741935483871

2429045,5,B000BMSUBI,"When the viewer considers that the whole happy Avatar band of friends are no older than 12 maybe 13 years old, the interest in the dynamics of these kids interacting together is just as enthralling as any special abilities that any of the characters may possess and display.

2429071,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is, no question about it, the best kid's show I've ever seen. I'm not usually into cartoon shows; but this series is so well-animated, the characters are so relatable, and the story is so captivating that I was hooked after the first episode. My husband and I watched all four seasons within less than a month, and I'm not really big on TV, period.

Other reviewers have summed up the plot, so let me just say that I suggest this show to everyone (whether they have kids or not). It teaches great lessons about love, loss, family, friends, striving toward a dream and never giving up. It teaches people to practice forgiveness and humility, and to overcome our differences. Also, it's one of those shows you can watch over and over and still spot something new each time. My hubby and I are not parents yet, but we look forward to introducing our future children to Avatar, as we know it will be a family staple.",1395705600,,917,4.491017964071856
2429072,5,B000BMSUBI,What a wholesome show for young children!!  It teaches such great values that you just can't find on television nowadays.,1395273600,,121,5.05

2429079,5,B000BMSUBI,"Simply and elegantly styled to be one of the best animated series of our time. It is funny and accessible while staying true to its original themes and goals. The style pulls references from many philosophies of our world to make a believable and simple new one. I watch the whole series at least once a year, and I'm considered an adult. (The polls are still out on that.)",1395014400,,373,4.420289855072464

2429083,5,B000BMSUBI,"i really love how amazing this seriese (inteded for young adiouce) looked and felt overall. the second season we notice how serious each episode became as they went along, giving us a darker story line while keeping it innocent enough for the younger viewers to enjoy.
Also, truly facisinating how they also played the character develoment from the previouse season, for exmaple, how Zuko mature and learn the real nature of his nationwhile going through a very harsh trial in his life. not something you will see in many cartoons.
 it trully gave us a nice develoment to enjoy and in some cases applied to our own selves (unlike some other animation where the character are the same 24/7).
also we got to enjoy and welcome new characters like Toph, Azula, Tylee, and Mai, who in my opinion we needed more female influence in this show. and we saw how they spiked the series and made us see diferent variations of personas with different goals and desires.
truly a master piece that would last throughout the ages. and I trully recomend this to anyone who wants a good fighting animation while giving us a good laugh.",1394668800,,1117,4.698979591836735

2429088,5,B000BMSUBI,You learn to love every character and become invested in the story. This show is so much more then a kids show. It is funny and epic. Season 2 is When the story starts to get mature and a new villain is introduced. This will always be my favorite show.,1394409600,,252,4.06
2429089,5,B000BMSUBI,"The above quote is from my now teenage son who has been re-watching the series with his brother.

2429091,5,B000BMSUBI,"This show is amazing. This season is amazing. That's the end of it.

If you like epic stories with the weight of the world falling on a few little kids you'll like this show. It's humor is kind of crazy, silly and often cheesy, but in a good way (if there is a good way =).

For parents: It's a little violent. No gore and rarely any deaths. The kids often express the desire to end the fighting, like the war and so forth. Ang the main character clearly want's to just be a kid and have fun. So this show certainly doesn't encourage violence as good thing. Violence is more like just a necessary thing to stop the bad guys.",1394236800,,624,4.148760330578512
2429092,5,B000BMSUBI,Just a good story.  I have watched the whole series several times and it never gets old.  Best when watched in order.,1394236800,,117,4.2727272727272725

2429099,5,B000BMSUBI,"Pixar and now Disney are doing projects that transcend age ... wonderful works that entrance both children and adults. Nickelodeon does it, too, with this series.

2429102,5,B000BMSUBI,"This show could go down as one of the best cartoons ever, it has character depth and development unlike any other cartoon and its realism is unmatched by any cartoon in recent history save Batman Beyond (Which has extremely dark thematic elements). The choreography for the different elements fighting styles is beautiful to watch as a martial artist, and adds credibility to the show, the creators obviously did their homework. Aang's development as the Avatar and as a person really goes to a whole new level in Season 2. As does one of my favorite characters Zuko.

The writers and creators don't perceive the audience as dumb or unintelligent, or even children. And they don't just drop random life lessons for certain episodes such as the majority of cartoons. Everything in the cartoon is character driven, and story driven. Everything shown is for a reason and not just filler space. The writers weave a masterpiece, and having not seen Book 3: Fire yet I look forward to the conclusion of Aang's story",1393459200,,1009,4.866279069767442

2429104,5,B000BMSUBI,"This animated series delivers on all levels.  This storyline is smart and original, the characters are loveable, rich and complex.  You really cannot help but feel for Prince Zuko and his tragic situation.  What can you do but cheer as Aang and his friends overcome one more obstacle on their difficult path.  This is not a series just for children.  It gives everybody, old and young, an opportunity to immerse themselves in a beautiful world that is filled with situations, people and issues that speak to our humanity...regardless of who we are are and were we've come from.  I so wish the movie would have done this great piece of work justice.  Totally brilliant!  Well done, Team Avatar.",1393286400,,693,4.813559322033898

This is a fantastic series that has wide appeal.  For kids, good characters, not a lot of overt violence or blood, a varied age of characters and FUN!

For teens and older, DRAMA!  This show has fantastic writing.  Deeper emotional issues than you would ever expect in an American cartoon.  Characters experience joy, sorrow, death of family members, love and loss.

One of my favorite things is that the characters progress and AGE.  You can hear their voices change and the physical character design progresses with the series.  This is something i have never seen in any American.  Totally awesome.  I cannot wait to get to season 3 and then Legend of Korra!",1391558400,,796,4.567375886524823

2429134,5,B000BMSUBI,"One of the best shows ever, period.  The M Night S. movie is not reflective of the awesomeness of this show.  This show is a classic. Before the movie came out, Nick did an interview with Brian and Dante with M Night S.  It was apparent that they were in awe of him, when it should have been the other way around. How many hours/years and how much effort and writing and research and artistic talent was put into Avatar? 1,000 times more than the movie for sure. Watched it with kids from the beginning, and watch it still, gets better each time!",1391385600,,546,4.281553398058253
2429135,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is a great story.  Fight scenes are amazing and long.  Just when you think the bending used is fight ending, it keeps going, and unlike Anime they don't start and stop episodes in the middle of them.",1391385600,,204,4.342105263157895

2429151,5,B000BMSUBI,"Got into this show when it used to come on Nick, and I'm now re-watching the series as a college student and picking up all the pieces of the story I had forgotten or never noticed.

The art is magnificent, but my favorite aspect is definitely the character development.  These kids are exceptionally real compared to most animated television characters.",1390694400,,354,4.883333333333334

2429154,5,B000BMSUBI,I've had many friends tell me about the Avatar series for a few years and never checked it out until recently.  Now I FULLY understand what they were talking about!  This is the continuation of an epic series and have continued to enjoyed every episode.  HIGHLY recommenced!,1390348800,,274,4.787234042553192
2429155,5,B000BMSUBI,I have never watched a series or read a book that developed the characters so well. My wife and I were referred to the Avatar series by some friends and we did not think we were going to like it because we don't really like most anime shows. This series surprised us completely. It totally sucks you in and gets you involved. You really start to love the characters and care for them as if they were real people. Even the villains are complex enough so that things are never black and white. The comic moments are hilarious and the dramatic ones get your heart pounding and mind spinning. I can't recommend the Avatar series enough. It blew my mind!!!,1390176000,,651,4.433333333333334
2429156,5,B000BMSUBI,"I have to say this animated series really surprised me. I enjoyed the movie so I thought I'd give the animated series a look so glad I did. Now it has some violence but it is FANTASY based so to those nay Sayers I say get over and let yourself enjoy the story. It has good vs. evil theme and redemption of a lost soul so the series portrays moral values. There are some laughs and sadness too. What I really enjoyed is they took the story to a conclusion, which we don't get due to ratings often. Again I found it to be an enjoyable watch during the winter doldrums.",1390089600,,566,4.108108108108108

2429162,5,B000BMSUBI,This show consistently makes me smile.  Its a children's show that's enjoyable for people of all ages.  Good lessons for kids about friendship and balance.  The characters are distinct and its just fun to watch. I'd recommend for everyone.  Was sad that the movie was so terrible.,1389744000,,280,4.8936170212765955

2429164,5,B000BMSUBI,Wished they'd make more!!!! LOK is not good enough! Seriously this was such a good show and I get that the next season the story plot ends but come on you can't just make 3 seasons and then make a crappier version of this in an entirely different show :|,1389657600,,254,4.1

2429168,5,B000BMSUBI,"The title pretty much sums it up...  This is quite possibly the best animated series aimed at children ever.  It's not dummed  down.  It doesn't talk down to kids or to adults watcing it.  It has sweeping arc storylines, the animation is phenominal, and the music is as good as it gets.

As a martial artist, I appreciate the lengths they went to to use real matrial arts in their bending (Tai Chi, Pa Kua, Northern and Southern Kung Fu).  There's even a sequence when Iroh is teaching Zkuo about channeling lightning when they are doig push-hands!  You don't even see that in live action films.",1389657600,,595,4.547169811320755

2429173,5,B000BMSUBI,"Humorous and entertaining for boys aged 6-11. Makes an easy, brief (30 min episodes) entertainment option. Clean content, worst it gets is perhaps a fart joke. Haven't met a girl who likes it much though, my daughter doesn't. Voiceovers are more well done than the acting in the live action movie.",1389225600,,297,4.8431372549019605

2429192,5,B000BMSUBI,"As a child of probably 5-8 years old I would watch this show all the time and enjoyed it so much. The show had a purpose, it taught good lessons without being boring, and was very funny. At 16 I just rewatched the entire series again and loved it just as much as I loved it when I was a kid. its one of the those great childhood shows that you'll never forget.
P.S. for those who finished watching all three seasons and still want more Avatar the Last Airbender, the comic book trilogy continues on the series and finishes up loose ends such as how Republic City was created (the city in which Legend of Korra takes place in) and what happened to Zuko's mother! As of right now, (12/29/13) there is only two comic books but in March of 2014 they will begin releasing the chapters to the final comic book (there are three comic books in the trilogy and each book has three chapters). I cannot judge the last one yet but the first two are amazing.",1388275200,,945,4.2555555555555555

2429195,5,B000BMSUBI,The only reason I gave this a 5 star rating is because there wasn't an option to give it a secret extra star rating making it the highest rated show EVER!!!  I wish there were more episodes and seasons...I hurt without you avatar!!,1388188800,,231,4.372093023255814

2429225,5,B000BMSUBI,Great stories and character development in my opinion. With a great end to the whole story.

2429226,5,B000BMSUBI,"Avatar is a wonderful show for two reasons.

One, it has demonstrated that Western animation has finally reached the level of depth, character development, and voice talent to rival other markets.

Two, it has a wonderful range of character types, points of representation (most notably for gender roles and people of color, with a main cast with racial traits and cultures based on non-white cultures).  This level of inclusion is rarely seen, and it is never a gimmick - never representation for represenation's sake.  Much of this show involves a culturally varied cast exploring a culturally dynamic world and directly interacting with the people, governments, and cultures they encounter.

And for the other things, art direction, music, etc. it remains at the highest quality.",1382659200,,782,5.274193548387097

2429290,5,B000BMSUBI,"An intelligently written, richly detailed fantasy world that's funny, exciting, and never too violent or scary; Avatar is an example of the kinds of kids' cartoons that are all too rare. The protagonists follow a cogent quest to defeat an evil fire lord and restore peace with the help of a reincarnated 'master of all four elements' i.e. the Avatar.
Throughout many adventures, setbacks, battles and bonding experiences, the main characters (almost all of them tweens or teens) grow as individuals while learning valuable lessons. As deep in fantasy as a Tolkein book, as funny as anything from the old Hanna-Barbera serials, and far less frenetic and nihilistically violent than the superhero/japanamation dreck that dominates kids' channels nowadays, Avatar just rocks!
Watch it with your kids. it's fun!",1375056000,,807,5.3125
2429291,5,B000BMSUBI,"I blame my kids for this addiction.

I don't normally watch TV, and my kids don't watch much either. But somehow they heard about this series, got hooked, and watched the entire thing (and read the graphic novels, etc.) Then they begged me to watch AVATAR with them. Now I can't quit.

AVATAR has good Japanese-style animation but the real attraction is the writing. Wonderful characters, excellent plotting, original fusion of multiple Asian cultural elements (Chinese, Japanese, Indian, etc. can all be found here). Classic quest tale plus coming of age tale, well told.

This series will appeal to any grownup who enjoys fantasy, SF, and good storytelling. Recommend.",1375056000,,670,5.128440366972477

Toph and Azula wind up as 2 of my favorite characters by the end... although Zuko's character development arc throughout all 3 seasons is masterful.

Bottom line... can't have season 3 without season 2... and while 3 is the best of them all... when you start from the beginning, 2 just builds on the foundation 1 built and the show steadily gets better without taking away from what came before.",1373846400,,570,4.428571428571429

All of the characters have depth and are developed brilliantly as the series develops.  I love this series for the bending, but it is so much deeper and richer than just that.  It is both entertaining and enlightening for both children and adults, and is arguably, taken in it's entirety, the best animated series ever created.  Brilliantly conceived and executed...a masterpiece of animated art.

As for the live action movie... the opposite of everything I just wrote above.  Tragic...that a series this good could be the source material of the worst movie ever created...literally.",1372982400,,756,5.206611570247934

2429313,5,B000BMSUBI,"Season 2 of Avatar: The Last Airbender felt to me to have similarities of The Empire Strikes Back. (NO, the fire lord is not Aang's father) I am speaking to mostly the ending. There is a huge sense that the story is not over and there is so much to come.  Ends kinda on a downer because of this feeling. HOWEVER, my family really enjoys watching this show together.

Uncle Iroh is one of my favorite characters of all cartoon shows, and his beliefs and encouragements to his nephew are truly words we can remember and use in our daily lives. Plus, the action does not disappoint - they do such a good job with animating the movements of all the benders that sometimes I think I can water bend or earth bend myself if I just get the movements right!

For people who are closed minded as far as religion, I recommend watching it with small children to answer any questions or concerns they may have.

2429375,5,B000BMSUBI,"This episode had quite a few subplots running through it that made it a good episode.  The episode kicks off with the kids settling in to get some rest and Toph and ""Sugarqueen"" having a spat.  The inherent problem is that Katara is a serious alpha female, control freak.  Aang is in love with her, so he would let her trample over him all day long (and she does) and Sokka has put up with it since he was a kid and he can work around it or just put up with it.  Toph on the other hand looks at her and doesn't play into her mother hen routine.  In some ways Katara is right, but frankly she's wrong on the argument they are having. I'm glad the writer's made Toph the way they did.  There's enough angsty girl in Katara to last a life time.  Toph reminds me of the earth: it doesn't put up with junk.  It's solid, unchanging.  Katara is one of those girls that takes herself WAY to seriously and just comes across like a queen.  Toph's name is appropriate.

That rant aside, the rest of the story really kicks into gear.  We see Toph meet up with Iroh and the two bond, revealing aspects of each's personality that the two need to see.  Again, the guise Zuko has struggled to keep is coming down and we really get an eyeful of Azula.  Dang, she is so powerful that she can stand against 5 benders + Sokka (yuck yuck) and still survive.  The ending leaves one wanting more and that is all we can hope for in a good story.

It just keeps getting better and better.  Stick around.",1352246400,,1478,4.166077738515901
2429376,5,B000BMSUBI,"Styled after the old Samurai/Western type movies of the past, in this episode we get a much deeper glimpse of Zuko and the anguish he has had to suffer from such a small age.  His story becomes much more complicated as we learn more about this troubled, misguided young man and the changes starting to occur within him.  An obvious ""mama's boy"" Zuko is tormented by his sociopathic sister and is loved by his over-bearing mother who at some point disappears.  It is obvious Zuko has not come to terms with his mother's disappearance nor of his banishment from the Fire Nation.  This episode could also be called a crossroads for Zuko, for at first he is rising up to move beyond his past, but when he is seriously tempted, he reverts to his old ways, even going so far as to announce himself as the Fire Lord's son to a town.  The villagers call him out on his assertion and it would seem that Zuko is beginning to see that his destiny is not wrapped in his father's.  It is a ""sins of the father"" type story.

As Zuko begins to put faces to people who have suffered similar fates as his himself and his uncle it begins to dawn on him that his path lies elsewhere.",1352160000,,1164,4.3119266055045875
2429377,5,B000BMSUBI,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that the character Toph is a great addition to the show.  She is a rather anti-social little girl, especially considering her over-bearing parents.  Though she's rough around the edges and is quite arrogant, it is not without reason.  This episode shows just the beginning of what Toph is capable of.  I had forgotten her name till I was closing in on this episode and remembered her Season 3 caricature in the fire lord play.  I won't spoil the name, but her reaction is absolutely hilarious!

I liked how they showed Toph's way of ""seeing"" and that in many ways it reminds me of Daredevil, but not as sucky or Benaffleckish!  However,she does have limitations, as they showed at the end of the episode where Sokka tosses to Toph her belt and it bonks her on the head and knocking her over.  Sokka was on Appa, so Toph's ""sight"" might not extend to organic matter.  Or just as likely it was a good sight gag!  Heh.  ""Sight gag.""

No Zucko nor Iroh this episode, but that's okay, we are introduced to the goofy earth bending teacher and promoter that will make their own appearances later, to humorous results.

Keep watching!  This show only gets better!",1352073600,,1195,4.5754716981132075
2429378,3,B000BMSUBI,"This was an alright episode.  I think I spent most of the episode smacking my forehead like Sokka due to the annoying hippies.  The other review about the cuteness of the episode is spot on, but I will turn my focus onto Zucko and Iroh

Uncle Iroh is in top form in this episode.  Not really concerned about the state of his existence, he focuses his attentions on finding tea and comes away with a nasty rash due to knowingly choosing to make tea out of something that could be poison (he claims that it might be some great tea.  It's plain to see that Iroh hides behind a cavalier attitude marked by a hedonism that belies something much deeper and worthwhile--regardless, it makes for some good tongue and cheek action).  Unfortunately, we see that Zucko is far from any real repentance as after being given food and good company by some survivors in the Earth Kingdom he repays that kindness by theft.  What was sad was that even Iroh consented to the poor choice.  The look on the survivor girl's face as she watches the two of them steal away (literally) into the night continues to show a world ravaged by greed amongst others.

Definitely filler and can be passed over safely as there is no real action, just more plot development and moving the story forward.  The other reviewer is accurate about that.",1351900800,,1312,4.54468085106383
2429379,4,B000BMSUBI,"I don't see many reviews for this episode but rather for the entire season.

This is a good episode.  We are introduced to Azula, a devious, borderline insane, power-hungry, sister of Zucko.  This is also the episode where we learn a little bit more about the Avatar state, hence the name.  Aang now has to be rather careful when he goes into the Avatar state, for if he dies, game over.  But what really shines in this episode is Iroh and Zucko.

While this wasn't the official beginning of Zucko's transformation, it marks the beginning of his desire to find his own path and uncle Iroh is right there, willing to guide this brash young boy into a far better man.  I only wish I had had an uncle like Iroh.  The plot development for Aang is not as extensive as it is for Zucko and this being my second time through, this was also the point in the story where I started to care more about Zucko than Aang and co.

This episode is good, but not great.  Mostly just groundwork being laid that will reach fruition much later in the season and series.  I truly do wish they would have allowed this series to go more than 3 years.  Instead they destroy it's legacy with the Legend of Korrah or whatever they call it.  That serious was a cross between Avatar and Fight Club.

Opinions aside, this season is kicked off nicely, leaving one wanting more.",1351900800,,1346,4.375

The characters seem so real--I felt the emotions from their voices and character expressions. When I watch this show, the characters seem as real as real people because all the emotions came through as if they were real.  The stories were so touching--they made me feel emotional and there were always new things to see and new adventures.  It was not just a dramatic show with moral issues, but it was also action packed.  The shows made me smile and sad at the same time.  After season 1, I had to watch season 2, but now you must watch season 3 after this.  It's really too bad that they ended it with season 3 because I think the story can go on forever.

- love the character and the feel it creates
- nostalgia trip
- many more, etc....
- friendship, love, adventure, i wish i could live in that era where peace and calm seems to be possible after the end

2429402,4,B000BMSUBI,"Most western animation for children is, to put it simply, really wretched. At best, it's tolerable.

But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements, and to restore the balance in the world. ""Avatar The Last Airbender - Book 1 Water, Vol. 1"" serves as a solid start to the series -- it smoothly introduces the characters and sets up some nice story arcs, without skimping on development of either.

South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago. You guessed it (and so does Katara): Aang is the Avatar who mysteriously vanished a century ago, even though he has yet to master Earth, Water and Fire. And, uh, he's a total goofball.

Unfortunately, a Fire Nation prince named Zuko has been wandering the world in search of Aang, and agrees to let the Water Tribe alone if Aang surrenders. Of course, Katara and Sokka set out to rescue their friend, and since Katara isn't experienced enough in waterbending to teach Aang, they set out for the North Pole to find a waterbending master.

But along the way they run into new problems -- first Aang returns to his old Temple and finds it in ruins, with all the Airbenders dead. Then the three visit Kyoshi Island, where the female warriors take exception to Sokka's sexism, and Aang starts getting a bit full of himself. Meanwhile, Zuko's quest is put in jeopardy when an arrogant general challenges him to a firebending duel.

The highest compliment I can pay ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is that it's like a thoroughly solid action/fantasy anime. Even though ""Book 1, Water: Volume 1"" is only the first few episodes of the series, it's pretty obvious that this is not a simple kid's show -- it's got good writing, excellent animation, and a general look rawn from Asian and Inuit cultures.

The first episode is a bit lackluster -- there's a bit too much of Aang goofing around, riding penguins and exploring old battleships, as well as some gross-out humor. But things tart gelling with the explosive fight scenes and grim confrontations of the second episode, especially since we really get to know the Prince Zuko there and get a glimpse of the Fire Nation' power.

And the whole quest-storyline has become nice and tight by the third and fourth episodes, even as our heroes stop for one-off stories. There's plenty of action and explosive fire-battles (particularly Zuko's brilliant battle with the sneering Zhao), but the writers never quite forget to include some comedy (riding the elephant koi) and character development.

And they do a good job with the characters -- Aang soon proves himself a kind and selfless kid, but still a kid. And we get to see some of his inner turmoil when he revisits his old home to find it a snowed-in, abandoned ruin, and his old master Monk Gyatso gone.

Katara and Sokka round out the cast, and are the required bickering siblings -- Katara is short-fused but sensible, and Sokka is rather swelled-headed although it's soon clear that he's courageous and means well. And though he's the antagonist, scarred teenager Zuko is excellent -- his quest obviously has deeper motives behind it, and he clearly isn't a bad person.

""Avatar The Last Airbendeer's"" first volume is a fairly smooth introduction to a solid action/fantasy series, and a good setup to an outstanding show. A bit wobbly at first, but it quickly picks up steam.",1233705600,,3485,4.78369384359401

I could instantly tell that the characters had gone through a lot of development and had their own ""inside"" jokes and history behind them.

A lot of shows today seem to be just a bunch of randomness with no development and no plot. Spongebob, Grim adventures of Billy and Mandy, Simpsons, Family Guy. Every show nowadays is basicly starting from square one at the beginning of every episode and simply putting those undeveloped characters into different situations.

This is not so for avatar. Throughout the series you get to see how the characters change and grow just like real human beings. New characters rise out of the storyline bringing in some minor characters you only see once or twice, and other new friends and villians that stay with the storyline until it's very end.

The script and artwork done by the authors is incredible. Clearly putting their 100% into creating every aspect of every episode making it into the Epic tale that it is.",1219017600,,1098,4.708333333333333

but i saw this anime one day from those wonderful fan made videos on the net and i saw a new hope in america's anime industry. the fighting scenes, costumes design and art styles. very japanese but with a american accent to it. it has depth to it with charactor development and a great sense of humour.

not to forget the wonderful voice acting which i can never appreciate from past dubbed anime.

2429412,5,B000BMSUBI,"With the brainless programming on network and cable television alike, it is a shame that a cartoon, which could easily be overlooked, is quietly setting the standard for quality entertainment. Avatar is the most universally entertaining program of any kind to be broadcast on any channel. Avatar has a big heart and wears it on its sleeve as prominently as Aang's head arrow or Katara's ""hair-loopies."" (Watch the show to understand.) I am 36. My wife is 28. We watch a lot of series on DVD since we bailed out on commercialised television. Avatar shows that something moving, meaningful and worthwhile can come out of a medium that is so abused by a sea of ""johnny-come-latelys,"" horrible writers, and network puppets who churn out the daily gruel for the masses. I am so impressed with this new mythology, the exemplary voice cast, the animation, and worldly scope of the creator's universe, that I tell everyone I know to ""just watch it."" But be ready: you'll likely get hooked. Avatar will invade your life with its wit, drama, and linear-type story. Avatar also provides the action-hungry youth with a great new hero while impressing adults with complex and intriguing characters, plots, and settings. With each episode running in a conservative time, I would say it is time well spent regardless of your ""tastes.""

2429414,5,B000BMSUBI,"This is literally the best serialized cartoon made by Americans in the past 10 years.  Michael Dimartino & Bryan Konietzko have created a fantasy world modeled after Asian nations and culture, full of martial arts magic.

Aang is the Avatar, the last of his race (the Airbenders).  As Avatar he is capable of harnessing the four elements that govern their world and keep the peace between the four races (one per element) that populate the world.  Shortly after learning his destiny as Avatar, Aang runs away from the responsiblity.  Near to death after a becoming lost in a seastorm, Aang becomes sealed in ice for a hundred years.

He is set free by Katara and Sokka, who eventually become his traveling companions.  Katara is a young untrained waterbender that is a driving force for Aang's change towards responsibility.  In turn, Aang helps Katara to have more fun.  After a time, Katara becomes his waterbending master.  Sokka is responsible in his own way as well, but ends up as almost comic relief for some of the more emotionally charged scenes.

Additional characters appear and stay with the series.  Prince Zuko is almost a foil for Aang at first before being shown as a more parallel character.  He travels with his Uncle, Iroh.  Zuko's sister and father, Fire Lord Ozai, tend to be the antagonists in the second book.  All are fire nation (the bad guys) but we see in both Zuko and Iroh that that fact does not automatically make them evil heartless killers.

In book two we meet Toph, a blind earthbender girl who doesn't want her family to know that she's a capable bender.  She becomes Aang's earthbending master, and is quite a tough teacher despite her apparent handicap of blindness.

The characters are memorable and well-developed.  The plot line is terrific with many different possiblities of how things could turn out. This is not a cartoon that cops out on sadness or death.  Avatar is not like some of the magical girl cartoons from Japan where people die and then in the next season or episode are right back up and kicking.  Avatar is a better reflection of real life.  When people die (and it's not always bad guys doing the dying) they do not come back. And sometimes the good guys do bad things either because they didn't have all the information or because there didn't seem to be any other alternative.  Hard lessons like truth, justice and good triumphant aren't always learned the first time.

But once I noticed the channel it was on Nickelodeon, which never shows Japanese anime just makes their own. I was shocked.

The anime is very well built, characters and story progress at a fair rate. The characters rub off on you and you fall in love with them. the story is easy to fallow and understand, plus the plot barely changes but you want to see what happens next, even if you know what will happen next (something all anime has).

Volume 1~ Chapter 1~ The Boy in the Iceberg

""Water... Earth... Fire... Air...

Long Ago the Four Nations Lived In Peace, but then everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

Only the Avatar master of all four elements could stop them.  Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.

But then when the world needed him most, he vanished.

100 years past and then my father along with the rest of the men of my tribe set out to journey to the earth kingdom.  Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.  Some believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air nomads... but I haven't lost hope, I believe that someday... somehow... the Avatar will return!""

That is the begging of the plot and of the story... soon therafter Katara and Sokka Discover the Avatar... An airbender named Aang who is 112 years old!  Yet still a mischevious 12 year old kid because he was trapped in an iceberg for 100 years.  Then Prince Zuko comes and takes the Avatar away.  Soon therafter Sokka and Katara chase after Zuko.  Then Aang, Katara and Sokka make a miraculous escape from Zuko and that ends the first volume... Sadly I can't tell you the good parts because I do not want to spoil the movie!

2429423,3,B000BMSUBI,"I am extremely disappointed in Nickelodeon's marketing of the DVD's.  First of all, there is absolutely no reason to sell Season 1 on 5 seperate disks other than to make as much money as possible from a bunch of 12-year-old's.  Secondly, Its also pretty scummy of them to put a block on skipping the previews because God forbid you might escape them with a few bucks left in your pocket.  And lastly, there are no extras wirth the name.

I got into this show with my kids last year and think its probably the most intelligent cartoon series I've ever seen.  If they keep filling their bloated pockets at kids' expense then I probably won't buy anymore disks firsthand and wait til they are on eBay at a discounted rate.",1153094400,4,719,4.5
2429424,5,B000BMSUBI,I found this show when my nephew and I watched tv to pass some time. He is five and I am twenty and I can honestly say there is nothing on tv that enraptures our attention in the way this cartoon does. I have done martial arts a few years and the movements and the direct link between the real arts and the poses and moves on the show are astounding. I have picked up all the dvds that have come out from this show and I actually started letting my boss watch them as well. He is 53 and even he loves them and asks me often to borrow my other dvds of it. This is one of the only shows I have ever found that everyone in a family can watch and be COMPLETELY satisfied with.,1152662400,2,672,3.8768115942028984
2429425,5,B000BMSUBI,"I didn't think it was possible, but they did it. An American team created an anime-stylized cartoon that is in every way better than any recent anime shows that have come out in the West. Avater really seems like a labor of love here. We have a wide, expansive plot, likeable characters, extremely well choreographed action, voice acting that's decent or, in the case of Mark Hamill as Fire Lord Ozai, incredible, and fantastic animation and color choices.

There's really nothing not to love about this series. The fact that this show is performing so well even with older (college age!) viewers might be a signal to networks that if you let your shows have a little more freedom then you'll be rewarded. I won't hesitate to call Avatar the best animated show on TV at the moment, because unlike some of the anime that plays on Cartoon Network, Avatar appeals to all ages and isn't badly dubbed.

There are funny parts, there are sad parts, and then there are just plain awesome parts to this show. It manages not to become formulaic (as some quest shows sometimes do) and each new episode continues the plot and expands the world. I don't think Avatar will stretch on forever, like some anime does, because the goal is in sight. It just takes the mastery of the four elements to be able to get there.

With a third season in production, there's no reason not to buy these DVDs except for one: If Nickelodeon were smart they'd release season boxsets with all 20 episodes on 3 or 4 disks (double sided is fine as long as it minimizes costs) for an affordable $20-$35. Warner Bros. has done with their cartoons, and they've sold well. Anyway, hoping that this will happen, I still maintain that Avatar is an excellent cartoon which everyone can watch. It doesn't insult your intelligence and the action is amazing. Buy and watch this series to help keep supporting it until the end.",1152403200,,1881,4.625748502994012
2429426,5,B000BMSUBI,"I understand that the consensus out there is that cartoons are for kids, but what about us adults? Well, this series draws in the standard young viewer, but there is enough here for adults like me to get excited about, too. The story of the Avatar is absolutely awesome. The characters are cool, but also can be very powerful. The enemy is just as interesting as the heroes. And while there are some silly moments, there are also moments of great action, intensity, and a genuine seriousness to the show. In fact, this show's greatest strength is it's outstanding ability to balance great humor with a wonderful and serious story. Also, each episode leads into the next one, so like a soap opera, you get hooked on what happens next. Finally, what can I say about the animation? Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

Did I mention the awesome fighting sequences?

  So yes, the kids out there will love this show, and for good reason. But for once, something is being shown on Nick that allows the little kid in all of us adults to get excited, too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1151452800,2,1066,4.684491978609626

2429428,4,B000BMSUBI,"To those who have been spoon fed lies and biased opinions that Avatar is a copy cat and that it is fake anime.  I'm here to tell you that isn't true, Avatar the Last Airbender is an
American cartoon that is based on chinese and other Asian cultures.  It isn't ""anime"", but it is one heck of a cartoon.  Avatar has something that most anime don't have (besides conservative dressers) and that is a sense of balance for younger children to older adults.  It is hard for a teenager to watch Full Metal Alchemist with his five year old sibling and thirty to forty year old guardian, without some content being deemed inappropriate and demonic and for the child, scary.  But with Avatar, there is simple humor, comical characters, and bloopers in fighting, making it balanced for both groups to laugh at and enjoy.

Avatar is an awesome mix between reality and fantasy.  The characters, which are predominately kids ranging from 12 to 17 have certain qualities that make them all unique but at the same time tied to the same destiny of interaction with the Avatar.

It brings to the table what Nickelodeon has been lacking for years, plot, character development, beautiful artwork, and background information, a sense of more mature moral values.

The display of martial arts is astounding, even more so is the fact that the martial arts are based on real Chinese Kung Fu, as you see in the Special Features.  Sifu Kisu is the teacher and shows you the basic techniques or principles behind the four bending arts also known as Airbending (BaGua), Waterbending (Tai Chi), Earthbending (Hung Gar), and my personal favorite firebending (Northern Shaolin).  He even gives some moves.  The only problem with these special features, is that most of it is an introduction, which you see over and over again, with a different background setting for each element. The moves that Sifu Kisu does are small moves, which leave the viewer wanting to see more of the realistic martial arts.  There could have been more with that, I believe.  He could have showed some basic stances and moves, which would have given the viewer a better appreciation and understanding for their favorite martial arts.

The music for the fight scenes are beautifully done and fit the situations well.  The second fight scene, episode 2, between Aang and Zuko in his room, is one of my favorites.  The music though upbeat and quick, but has a slightly clumsy sound to it, which is relevent in how Aang fights Zuko.

I wish that the dvd had been categorized into chapters, so that a person could skip the intro, and right onto the actual show, but doing that just skips intro to intro.",1150588800,6,2644,4.735807860262009
2429429,1,B000BMSUBI,Pepole think this is a anmie show full of great action well let me tell you something! IT'S NOT! True the animation may look like it but I have been reading Naruto for a few years and this is totaly copying it. For a while I have seen Nickloden trying to copy anmie anmation and this is the only one that has seceded! Martin Mystery was terbile and went of the air in about 2 weeks after it's permire. Avtar on the other hand really pisses me off somneone should sue Nickloden for all this copyright they are doing. Pepole will probley be appeled to it at first but will slowley stop to watch it and pay more atintion to Naruto as with the secound season.

2429430,5,B000BMSUBI,"Okay! I'll confess! I am 41 years old and I love this show! I was at a friend's house a few months ago, and his 10 year old daughter was totally hooked on this show. I watched one episode with her just to show that I was a caring uncle-type guy I was. It was funny! It was like anime...but strangely not Japanese in style. The kids were smart and brave and realistic. The show was funny and very charming. Once I saw Appa (Aang's giant flying Bison) I was hooked!

My friend's daughter wanted to watch another episode. They had them all on Tivo. Next thing you know, there are 3 of us adults and only the one kid watching the show, and I don't know who was enjoying it more!

I think my favorite episode is the one where Aang, who was frozen in ice for 100 years, runs into his childhood friend Bumi. It is a very funny episode, and begins the onslaught against one poor farmer who is forever getting his cabbage cart run into by somebody. He appears in later episodes as well, and his plaintive cry of ""My cabbages!"" is like a great parody of the dreaded ""fruit cart"" cliche in live action films. This is the cliche that appears in nearly every chase scene where suddenly out of nowhere the ubiquitous fruit cart appears and the all the drivers crash into it.

There is fun, and there is responsibility. Yin and yang. It makes for a great show.",1149811200,3,1345,4.266666666666667

Fun and intrigue for the whole family that is so rare now days with lesser quality animations on the rise with little or no plot.

This series sheds perspective on life's little problems and how to face them in a very entertaining way. The children will like the moment to moment action and the individual plot lines in each episode and the adults can enjoy the overall story arc and plot.

Definitively a must in the family library.",1147996800,7,691,4.468253968253968
2429432,3,B000BMSUBI,"Avatar is the best children's show to come around in years.  It's not the first show to try and entertain kids and adults at the same time, but it is the first I have seen do both so well.  Instead of mixing adult references with inane banter and silly antics, Avatar finds common ground where both children and adults can be entertained together.  It has just the right mix of action, humor, character development, and a developing story that grows from episode to episode.  As great a show as Avatar is, it deserves much better treatment in the DVD release.

There are 5-6 advertisements at the start of the DVD that have to be skipped over one by one to get to the show.  Hint to DVD developers: If you want to put adds on a DVD, put them in the main menu and not at the start of the DVD.  The former will draw people in, while the latter just feels like an imposition.

There are very few extras and they are very short. (Less than 5 minutes total.)  They are moderately interesting, but should have been much better.  There are also no chapter breaks within the episodes.  It would have been good enough just to place chapter breaks where the commercial breaks would have been instead of one chapter per episode.

This may not be the fault of the DVD, but the episodes are all in 4:3 instead of 16:9.  If a 16:9 version is available then it should have gone on the DVD.  If not, then the show's producers need to check the year on their calendars.

Paying over $3 for each half-hour episode is bad enough, but could be excused if at least some thought was put into releasing a decent DVD.",1147392000,7,1593,4.33445945945946
2429433,5,B000BMSUBI,"This show is seriously not just for kids (though they will definitely love it).  It's like a cross between Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings, mixed with Asian culture and mythology.  It's got drama, martial arts combat action, rich character development, spectacular battles between gigantic armies, complex antagonists, an intricate mythology that keeps expanding, a series-length epic story arc, and ongoing linear plot continuity from each episode to the next.  Even if you never watch animated shows, I reccomend checking this one out because it is really different than most ""cartoons.""  Everything is drawn in a realistic style and I get the impression that they would have made it a live action show if it weren't for the fact that all the incredible special effects would have been prohibitively expensive to pull off that way.

So try watching this show (preferably from the beginning).  The DVDs are worth it.",1147132800,,924,5.086092715231788
2429434,5,B000BMSUBI,"Avatar is without a doubt one of the best all around shows to come down the pipe in a very long time.

I don't have cable so I haven't seen much of it on TV. I first found out about it when I was at a friends doing some work and it was on as background noise for the kids. It was somewhere in the middle of the season so I didn't know the story but I was really impressed. I though, wow, the Japanese have done it again. But having watched a lot of anime in my younger days some stuff didn't add up. The style was different, the sight gags and most importantly the body language of the characters was different.

I was really surprised when I found it was an American production! I wanted to see more. I was wondering if it was worth buying, my kid only being 2 ? so I figured what the heck, its not that expensive for one disk.

I ordered it and it was an instant hit at the house. My son loved it goes running around with a stick saying he's going to save the world.  My wife loved it and I loved it. The show is written to a good middle ground between kids and adults. The kids will follow the story without issue and the adults will see deeper into the world. Its not too deep mind you but deep enough to feel there is more going on than whats immediately on screen.

I was really impressed by the creativity of the series and just how well done it was. The producers pulled together a lot of elements from Asian culture and tradition and blended them together into a credible setting in a way I've not really seen done very well outside of Asian works.

They've got a lot of gags and elements that are not exactly original. Strong liberated female figure in male dominated culture, chauvinist/clueless/useless guy, obligatory cute pet/sidekick, reluctant hero, ruthless villain etc. But they are well done and not overdone.

Many of the sight gags revolve around bad things that happen to the hapless/clueless guy. But they were well done enough to be funny without being tired. I was particularly glad they didn't give too much screen time to the cute pet/sidekick which some kids shows seem to devote about 1/3 of each episode to the antics of that creature. He (A flying lemur like creature) pops in and pops out for some good comic relief but never eclipses those involved in the story.

We also begin to see some depth in Character development and hints that some may not be exactly as they seem. Particularly with the apparent villains of the series. They actually have motivation and character beyond just wanting to give the hero's a bad day or ruling the world.",1144713600,30,2575,4.361169102296451

I figured it was going to be another cheap japanese Anime wannabe cartoon (anime not made in japan) I decided to give it a shot. Superisingly it was really good! The artwork is beautiful, they got the anime style down really good. It has a good plotline too. This show isin't like anything currently on nick. I'm glad nick finially put on some good shows, (ever since invader zim, and other classic nick shows were canceled)

Plotline, a brother (saka) and sister(katara), two water tribe members (ability to use an art to control water) find a 1000 year old glacier with a boy trapped inside. The glacier melts and the boy, who is named Ang, he doesn't remember anything, or that his Air bending tribe was detroyed and everyone was killed) Katara and Saka soon discover that Ang is the Avatar (a bender capable of learning all bending techniques Air, water, fire and Earth) Katara and Saka try to help him learn all the bending techniques to help save the world from a war caused by the fire nation. Prince kuzo, a fire nation prince who was banished by his father is trying to gain honor by capturing the Avatar, so he pretty much slows them down xD

This show has something to appeal to everyone, and the underlying messages of responsibility, maturation, friendship and family (with honor and duty sprinkled in) will resonate.

2429447,5,B000BMSUBI,"I was channel surfing one day and stumbled across this show on a kid's station. After watching the show, I quickly grew angry. Why do they hide such great stuff on kids-only stations?!

As a seasoned veteran of cartoons, I must say that Avatar- The Last Airbender is a joy to watch. I've never seen martial arts animated so well. Not only is the animation top-notch, but the writing is fantastic. The banter between the three main characters- Kitara, Aang and Sakka, is witty and well-written and rivaled only by Prince Zucco's arguments with his lackadaisical grandfather.

The story is simple (and thankfully retold in the opening of every show, pretty convenient!). Aang is an airbender who is the reincarnation of The Avatar- master of all the elements water earth fire and air. He was frozen in an iceberg for 100 years and only recently awakened by two water tribe siblings- Kitara and her brother Sakka. During Aang's absense, the harmony between the elements was disrupted. The Fire Nation has attacked the Earth Kingdom, Air Nomads, and soon the Water Tribe. Only the Avatar can restore balance to the elements. Aang travels on his flying buffalo with Kitara and Sakka as he attempts to master all four elements before a meteor hits at summer's end. Sound exciting? It is.

Expect a great story, fantastic writing, jaw-dropping animation in a cartoon with heavy eastern influences. It's funny adventure with plenty of moral lessons and tales of friendship winning over all odds. I especially like Prince Zucco's role in the story as both a hero and villain.

I highly recommend this DVD for kids and adults. You'll be sure to watch it again and again.",1141689600,2,1660,4.855123674911661

2429452,5,B000BMSUBI,"I can remember the first time catching the show on accident on Nickelodeon--I was channel surfing and came across this strange cartoon I had never seen before.  One that had a blue arrow on his head.  I thought to myself, wow, that's silly.  But I kept the show on and gave it a chance.  The more I watched, the more my interest grew.  So I watched it a few more times and to my great satisfaction and surprise, I think I've found a show to look forward to.

Long ago existed an Avatar who was a master of bending the four great elements of the world--Water, Earth, Fire, and Air.  But then the Fire Nation waged war and havoc, wanting control and power over the world.  The only being who can save and unite the four nations again is the Avatar!  But when the world went searching for him, he disappeared for one hundred years, and war has reigned ever since.  By striking chance, a practicing water bender, Katara, and her brother Sokka, discover the new Avatar, Aang, who was frozen in ice since the disappearance of the last Avatar.  To much surprise, it is only a 12 year old boy!  Katara's and Sokka's destiny is now to help Aang find teachers to train Aang so he can master bending the four elements to restore peace in the world.  With the help of Momo, a fun white lemur, and his giant flying bison Appa, Aang sets his journey ahead of him with his new friends, which later he recognizes as his family.  But running after the Avatar is the banished Fire Nation prince, Zuko, who plans to capture the Avatar; something his father was never able to do.  By capturing the Avatar, Zuko hopes to restore his honor and respect from his people, and more importantly, respect from his father.

I like this show because of its simple and kid-like nature.  Aang likes to have fun, even when it means having fun when he has the whole world depending on him to save the world.  His simple and open mind lead him into disasters and adventures, but he always comes out unharmed and with a new experience in which to learn from.  And when he and his friends are most in need, he's as dependable as they come.  I like the nature of a kid having fun and being simple minded, without the constant worries most adults seem to have in their lives.  This show examples why it is important not to forget to have fun, and that being just a kid, no matter how old, is ok to be sometimes.  The only drawback of the DVD is a common one amongst the other reviewers, in that there are only 4 episodes.  Fortunate for me, I discovered the show later than its premiere, so all the shows on the disc were new except Chapter 4.  But of course, I'd like to see more.  Four shows for me is just not enough!  Besides that, I'd recommend the show to both adults and children.  Nickelodeon has surprised me by airing a show like this on their station, as I don't recall ever having seen anime on it before (though I know there was a way while back), or any other show like this at all.  If you haven't seen Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender, I'd highly suggest it.  It's entertaining and every story leaves you feeling good after watching.",1138665600,3,3118,4.3552859618717505

2429454,5,B000BMSUBI,"I keep seeing Avatar compared to and described as Anime.  While I can see why people lump it into that category, I have to say that Avatar is much better than most anime I've seen.  This is nowhere near any Pokemon, Dragonball Z, or even Akira.

If you are a fan of quality cartoons, but not so much into anime, this is still a great show to check out.  The animation compared to most today on television is magnificent.  The stories and dialogue are interesting for all ages with very funny moments and lessons that are more subtle than most kid's shows cram in your face.  And the best part is, you fall in love with these characters, even the evil Fire Nation Prince and his kooky uncle.

This is by far the best animated show to come out in a long time, comparable to the classic Disney Animation we all miss.  Don't pass Avatar up!",1138406400,4,836,4.314102564102564
2429455,5,B000BMSUBI,"Okay, let me just say this: Avatar is one of the best shows around. I can easily state this fact.

Also, I'm a very picky buyer. I only own about eight or nine Dvd's myself, and the reason is I only buy it on Dvd if I know I'll watch it more than one other time, because if I won't, then why get it, right? (Not the point...) Well, the point is that I am totally going to get this whole set of Avatar and I'll love it. (The only set of Dvd's I own is Fullmetal Alchemist, which I love.)

But, all in all, Avatar is a great show that has a great storyline, loveable characters, and some of the best lines ever. I'm sure anyone would absolutley love this series, it's a must-buy.",1138060800,4,677,4.007407407407407
2429456,5,B000BMSUBI,"Like a lot of the other writers, I was pist about the way Nickalodean was selling the Avatar. Let me say that the Avatar is the best anima series I have ever seen, but the fact that Nick is selling 4 epasodes per DVD IS DRIVING ME INSIAN!!
I never watched anime before, but when I saw the add for the Avatar on NICK, I had to see it. Going into it I found myself going crazy over it. so I introduced it to my twin brother and he liked it. Then my sister saw us watching it and got hocked too.
By the end of the season I loved the Avatar, but then I realized that I haden't taped any of it. So I figeured I'd by it on-line, but then I find out that Nick is only selling the first season at Jan, 31, it drove me crazy. Then I started to reed these reviews and found a lot of people were pist too. Then this one review said if we write enough leters, they might change it to a box set. So people out there, KEEP WRITING!!!",1138060800,5,919,3.8421052631578947
2429457,5,B000BMSUBI,"... and it has nothing to do with marketing.

There's only so much space on a single disc in which to record higher quality video. For the most part, 4 half hour episodes plus a few extras is pretty much the norm. Until we get higher capacity discs and newer DVD players in the market, that's just the way that it's going to be.

As to the series, I'm first in line to buy it. We, just like many have said, absolutely love the fact that we parents and our kids can all sit down together and thoroughly enjoy it.

I would have no problem whatsoever buying every single episode, even if it's in 4 discs per season. To me, it's more than worth it.",1136678400,8,644,4.136
2429458,5,B000BMSUBI,"Yes, I'm going to join the chorus praising the series.  It's stylish, the art and character designs are high-quality, and each episode holds up well for multiple viewings.  There's drama, suspense, more action than you can throw a stick at, and plenty of humor to ease the way.  The core characters are well-rounded, and they grow as the first season progresses.  We get backstory slowly, woven into the story.  We keep learning about the characters.

While I, too, would have preferred a series set over single-disk releases, I can't pretend to be surprised.  I buy a lot of anime, and Japanese series are released one disk at a time.  Maybe a complete set comes out sometime after the regular releases are done, with a nice box.  Anime fans pay a premium for their fix - $20-$30 for 3-5 episodes, $80-$200 for a series/season box set.  While this is Nickelodeon, not a US-license of a Japanese series, let's face it:  Avatar isn't Spongebob.  This show isn't like anything else on Nick.  The production values are much higher, and the production costs increase proportionally.  A $40 season set isn't likely any time soon.

There is a rumor that a box set with unknown bonus features will be released AFTER the single disks are all out.  Again, this is typical practice for anime releases, not a nefarious Nickelodeon plot.  Those who are disappointed or peeved should contact Nickelodeon to ask about a set.  Let them know they've failed to meet your expectations.  If you refuse to buy the series piecemeal - tell them why.  If they don't get feedback, they're not going to reconsider their release strategy.

This series is well worth owning on DVD.  The question is whether you want to treat yourself to a disk every couple-three months, or wait and see what is offered in a year or so.  There's no wrong answer here... but buy it sooner or later.  It is that good.

>>> JUNE 2006 UPDATE:  a season 1 box set  has been announced for September.  No pricing information yet.",1136419200,65,1978,4.704678362573099
2429459,5,B000BMSUBI,"Good job on a show, Nick. Bad job on the marketing/release on the DVD, imo. Even though it may be a little selfish, and I understand that the way Nick releases DVDs has been the way they've released all their shows for years, I feel that a season DVD would be very much appreciated.

This show is amazing. It is one of the very few shows I can watch on Nickelodeon now, and it is great. Every single show, imo, has amazing art direction and style and the story is plenty involved for me. I can't wait 'till the next season comes out, but I just wish I could have the first one on DVD. The season finale was amazing, I just loved it. I can't get over this show. If you haven't seen it, go watch it now. I recommend it completely.",1136073600,3,728,4.090909090909091
2429460,5,B000BMSUBI,"I'm going to sound like the nth person when I say this, but I must.  When I first saw the commercial for a new Nick series called ""Avatar,"" I was skeptical.  After all, I have seen plenty of imitation anime that American companies tried to pass off and fail.  But when I sat down and watched Avatar, I was glad that I did not miss it!  To tell you the truth, I tend to watch a LOT of anime, and American animation frankly, hasn't been terribly entertaining since the days of Batman: TAS and Gargoyles.  But Avatar has rebuilt my faith in the creativity of American animation.  The show has memorable characters, hilarious comedy, intense action, and a storyline more complex than what one would normally expect from ""children's cartoons.""

I see that many people have been complaining about the price of the DVDs, but in my view, they are very cheap.  By comparison, a typical anime DVD that has four eps. retails for around $20.  At $12 per volume, Avatar is a steal.  I only wish that Nick would release information on the supposed boxsets though, since I would like to support the artists by buying the best versions available.

*interesting note- Avatar, along with a large portion of American and Japanese animation, is drawn in South Korea.*",1135036800,7,1247,4.648401826484018
2429461,5,B000BMSUBI,"I would like to clear up for a lot of fans out there that Avatar the last air bender is NOT Anime. It does not come from Japan. It was never meant for a Japanese audience, but an American audience. It does compare to a lot of great Japanese Animes. Avatar is one of the few Anime type knock offs that are actually really good. Because it is more than someone trying to market the Japanese Animation sub-culture, it is NOT some cookie cutter show that tried to throw in a few Asian influences and hoped that the American market would eat it up. Anime itself was initially inspired by a lot of Walt Disney's work. That doesn't mean that anime ripped off of Walt Disney. It is so with Avatar, It was inspired by Anime and proved to be a fantastic show on its own.

Another subject I would like to address is the cost. I am not saying that $12 is fair for two episodes, but to compare to the ""Lost"" season 1 DVD is very unfair. Decently animated cartoons like Avatar are a lot more expensive to produce than live action shows. Plus ""Lost"" has a known demographic that is a lot broader than any anime or cartoon. Whereas they can make less money on a known DVD box set that IS going to sell enough units to recoup their money, Nickelodeon is probably trying to test the waters and see if enough individual DVDs will be sold, to recoup their initial losses of making a box set for Avatar.

Honestly I would like to state that Avatar is an amazingly good cartoon that happens to be made by an American company for Americans. Don't look it over because it is not a real Anime. The feelings in the series are real; you can feel for Aang in that he has outlived his time, that anything that felt real is 100 years old and his struggle to bring balance to his world.

Hopefully you decide to support this amazing series and hopefully enough people do to, so that a box set will be possible.",1134604800,5,1879,4.257703081232493
2429462,1,B000BMSUBI,"In case anyone missed the ""NicksGivingMarathon"" featuring all Book One, Avatar episodes, it is great that another one will be aired on Christmas. Hopefully the commercial buffers would be better than the guys dressed in Turkey costumes that were in the November marathon. Still, what is better than digital imaging! This shows animation, storyline, character development, alongside the voice talent is refreshingly realistic. The overall mood is certainly that of which is common in ""anime"" and what keeps this show attractive(think about it). I'd love to own the DVD; instant replay.",1134604800,3,584,5.428571428571429
2429463,5,B000BMSUBI,"I wanted to buy two sets of the first season of Avatar for my niece and nephew and for my friend's kids for Christmas. I was prepared to pay well over a hundred for both, but like everyone else here, I'm astonished that you're not making this excellent, kid-oriented fantasy series available for the biggest kid-oriented day of the year.

Guess I have to find something else to buy them. Since they all already watch the show now, my guess is that by their birthday's next year, they'll have gotten bored of the show, so I probably won't be buying the series from anyone.

Wish I'd have known you'd be doing this. I decided not to record them on DVD, edit the commercials and give the DVD's as gifts because I'd rather give you money for what you've done and give them boxed, official versions.

So now you don't get paid, and they don't get Avatar for Christmas. Next time you have a hit series, plan the DVD release a little better, ok?",1134518400,5,938,4.410404624277457

  I really do want to buy these dvd's for my family - but I won't. Not yet. You could release the whole season in one set, just like the very successful Batman or Superman Animated series. But you aren't. So I'm holding off.

2429469,4,B000BMSUBI,"This is a really great show for the whole family.  I can watch it with my 10, 4 and 2 yer old and there's something in it for all of us. Unlike many Japanese anime shows, Avatar's plot lines and underlying themes are well written, easy to follow and entertaining.  There are also good morals behind most episodes and great themes like team work, self sacrifice, family, friendship, and redemption.  This makes for good conversation after each episode.

My question to Nick is why haven't they included more episodes on this disk?  And are they firing the marketing team that came up with the January '06 release date.  One month earlier and I probably would have coughed up the dough for the overpriced disk in order to have it under the Xmas tree for my kid.  But now I guess I'll wait til next Xmas and buy the inevitable ""First Season"" collection which is sure to be a better deal.",1133568000,6,884,4.4875
2429470,1,B000BMSUBI,"This is beginning to sound suspiciously like how Spongebob was presented.  First came the disks with five episodes grouped by themes for $15 each, then later came the entire seasons for $30 each.

Avatar is a great show and I'd rate the show a 5, but this review is for the DVD.  And at $12 for four episodes out of a twenty episode season, thus $60 at this pricing structure for Season 1, it's just too expensive.  I'm going to wait until the entire season is released for $30 or so... though this may be another year or two.  I'm a patient man.",1133308800,14,546,4.262135922330097
2429471,5,B000BMSUBI,"Let me say first of all that I love this show. There are very few shows that my whole family will sit down and watch at the same time, and Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of them. The story of Aang and his friends trying to reach the North Pole so he can begin his quest for mastery of the four elements by learning Water Bending (to go with his Air Bending mastery), is not only very well done, its cool for both kids and adults. Based loosely on Chinese/Japanese mythology and martial arts, the character/creature designs are interesting, the action is always great, but not at the expense of the smaller moments, and the funny moments as well.

What I don't like in Nickelodeon only including the first 4 episodes on the first release. Why not release the whole first season? I understand this way is probably more price friendly for parents who's kiddos love the show, but it seems like they are trying to squeeze us for everything they can. But other than that, I'm planning on buying all the discs and can give this release my highest recommendation.",1132790400,69,1058,4.510416666666667
2429472,5,B000BMSUBI,"My wife, son and I love this show as well. It's really well done. There's a 9 hour marathon either tomorrow or Thursday.

According to [...], this DVD has the first four chapters:

Ch. 1 - The Boy in the Iceberg
Ch. 2 - The Avatar Returns
Ch. 3 - The Southern Air Temple
Ch. 4 - The Warriors of Kyoshi

It also includes a ""Behind-the-scenes Kung Fu"" featurette. Whatever that means.

To echo the comment that followed mine, they're really gouging us for these. With only 4 of the half-hour episodes on this DVD, it'll take 5 DVDs to get us all 20 episodes from Season 1 (Book 1). At $12 per DVD, that's $60 for the first season. By comparison, you can get Lost: Season 1 with 24 episodes for $30 right now on Amazon and the same with the newly released season 5 of Seinfeld. For a closer comparison, the first season of Spongebob is $40 (20 episodes). Even Invader Zim gave you 17 episodes for $17! Jeez.

I REALLY hope they don't release a few of these and then later decide to do a whole season set for less money. I'd be tempted to hold off and wait. On the other hand, I don't want to hold off on buying it if they're gauging whether or not to release the whole thing by sales of the first one.",1132617600,11,1198,4.146551724137931
