2165970,4,B000641Z40,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average.

Besides a fight scene at the beggining, it's what one would call a ""clean"" movie.

Lupin and his gang are solving the secrets of a secret treasure protected by highly advanced technology that's years ahead of it's time. Located in a fictional country of Zuffu (a middle east like country) with a evil general leader who has a thing for knives and swords.

2165973,3,B000641Z40,"It always turns out that I want to love Lupin III more than I actually do. The problem is that for one brief shining moment Lupin appeared in a masterpiece. `The Castle of Cagliostro' is considered the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of Lupin; some even consider it the greatest anime of all time. All other Lupin III movies are disappointing in comparison to Hayao Miyazaki's fabulous work. There have been some very enjoyable movies through the years and some not so good ones. I have to put `Dead or Alive' into the not so good category.

The animation is passable but nothing to write home about. The plot is rather dull and lifeless. Lupin, Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko are once again hunting for fabulous treasure this time on an island that looks like it's composed of a wrecked aircraft carrier or some such thing. A lot of stuff didn't seem to be well explained. The island is protected by nano-machines who attack on sight, not in the way one might expect a nano-machine to attack by say invading your body but by creating bladed weapons that extend from the walls. The nano-machines more resemble living clay. So Lupin needs to figure out how to get past the nano-security while also dealing with the local despot General Headhunter who's also trying to figure out the secret of the nano-machines.

My biggest problem was with the amount of time spent on peripheral characters that I didn't care about. I watch Lupin III to see interaction of the main four characters along with Inspector Zenigata not some boring side character. There was also a lot of unnecessary padding in the movie.

As a long time fan of Lupin III I have to say that I complain because I care. I want to see a long healthy existence for the Lupin franchise and movies like `Dead or Alive' will probably not bring aboard too many potential fans.",1111881600,6,1826,4.6645962732919255
2165974,4,B000641Z40,"This was a good movie, not the best, but it was still good. The ending was different, but different is good in this case.

There are 2 English tracks, one surround and one stereo, and there is a Japanese track in mono. I wish the Japanese track was in stereo, but it's not that bad.

There are two subtitle options on this DVD. One option is subtitles of the Japanese track, and the other is dubtitles of the English track, so if you're watching the movie in Japanese, make sure to select the right subtitles so you won't end up watching the dubtitles!

The Monkey Punch interview was a nice extra! For the casual Lupin fans, it tells you some good information that you might not have known before. I had hoped for more extras, like pictures from the movie program like Geneon did with Mystery of Mamo.

If you don't like the English voices, you can always watch it in Japanese! The Japanese voice actors are good. It's not like the English voice actors aren't good, but the names of Lupin and Jigen are mispronounced, and everyone else has an annoying accent.

Interview with Monkey Punch

This is the third Lupin theatrical feature to be released in the United States (the others being the Castle of Cagliostro and the Mystery of Mamo) and the first theatrical feature of Lupin to be released by FUNimation.

The grand Monkey Punch himself (who created the awesome series) took the directing chair for this movie, and the results could not be any better. This is one movie that has a lot of action. It doesn't have as much comedy as the other Lupin movies, but there are a few comedic moments. The entire movie is action packed and entertaining.

Dead or Alive was originally made in 1996, but the animation is fluid and visually appealing. Dead or Alive is a must-have for fans of the action genera, not just anime or Lupin fans!

I was disappointed with how FUNimation handled this release! The Japanese track is only in mono, the widescreen is not anamorphic, and the transfer could have been better! The packaging is also questionable.

But what matters is the content, which is good, so don't waste time! Get your hands on this movie now. You won't be disappointed! You'll be pulling this movie off the shelf time after time! DVD extras include a video interview with Monkey Punch himself!",1105142400,8,1439,4.905349794238683

I did enjoy the plot and the acting was very good. I liked how Fujiko was a lot more tough and still just as sexy. Lupin was a lot cooler and still managed to make me laugh. I did like the 2 extra people like Michael and Pierre. (personally I thought Pierre was really cute. loved the fact that he knew karate and a computer genius) However I did not like the extra nerd toward the end. A little to weird and there was no need to add him in at that point. Pierre could of done all of that. The inspector was excellent too.

2165986,5,B000641Z40,"I fail to be disappointed with this movie.  The fifth theatrical feature for Lupin III, this is the only one that was directed by Monkey Punch himself (who found the job so exhausting that he decided to never do it again.  Pity).  Given the director, it's not surprising that character designs were different, with Goemon and Zenigata, in particular, looking far more like their manga counterparts.  I can see how some might find that too distracting for comfort, but I enjoyed the change.

The animation itself is fluid and has aged well, despite the movie being decades old.  The story, while unusual for Lupin III, is still good, paced well (though it does slow slightly in a few spots - nothing serious), funny, very action-packed, and gives everyone something to do.  This is also one of the earlier animated features that portrays Zenigata as something more than a buffoon, which is a shtick that I tire of quickly and is probably one of the reasons why I am fond of ""Dead or Alive.""

As to the DVD itself, FUNimation has an acceptable, though not impressive transfer (this was a theatrical release - I know the picture quality can get crisper than what I'm seeing on the screen); the extras are minimal, as is the usual with FUNimation, though this does include an interview, which is a pleasant addition.",1402963200,,1312,4.723684210526316
2165987,5,B000641Z40,"I remember when this special came out (1989 - the first of the annual TV specials), and my mind was blown.  When I picked this up recently, I was not really expecting to have a similar experience, considering that this has strong aspects of a techno-thriller and technology has advanced at light-speed since 1989.  How pleased I was to be so very wrong.  Yes, there are a few places where the film shows its age - painfully, even, in a couple of spots - but as a whole it's still a great movie.  The overall storyline holds up, the animation is still great (to be expected from a director as gifted as Dezaki Osamu), the pacing is good, characterization is top-notch, and the lunacy that is always present in Lupin III productions is very much evident.  Yay, rubber duckies.

Unlike FUNimation, Discotek is not miserly with their DVD extras.  This disc includes commentary, notes, image gallery, and a trailer.  It also has an English dub that I won't comment on because I dislike watching dubbed anime.  The sub-titles, though, are nicely done, though with a few instances of 'what were they thinking?!!'  For example, during the shoot-'em-up at the warehouse early on in the movie, the subtitles have Lupin saying ""What are they gonna hit with an aim like that?""  What he actually said was ""That old man is what they're after.""  Honestly, that line was not rocket science, and it isn't the only error I noticed.  Be warned.

All in all, this DVD is not a waste of money.  For fans of Lupin III, this should be a must-have.",1402790400,2,1524,4.592592592592593
2165988,1,B000641Z40,"I bought the DVD because I thought it had a new English dub, but I found the dub very old.  It was the same as in the old VHS version released in 1996.  Lupin is called Wolf and the script is not true to the Japanese.  Since I already had the VHS and the Japanese version DVD, I was so depressed.  I wouldn't have bought this if I had known its dub is 20 years old...

But the anime is so great that it still worth buying if you've never seen it before and you watch it in Japanese with English subtitles.",1402272000,,505,3.911764705882353
2165989,4,B000641Z40,"This is a fun movie and very Lupin III, which is pretty much all I'm looking for.  Unlike most of Lupin's capers, this one has some of the action taking place in the arenas of business and finance as opposed to thievery (not that thievery doesn't occur - perish the very thought!).  Luckily, this doesn't mean that the pacing bogs down while we are all regaled to the excitement that is accounting; things remain engaging.  Animation quality is good, as is characterization - everyone gets to do something - and the humour is enjoyable, as always.  All in all, this is a good movie, but it's not so great as to warrant going to lots of trouble over it.

The sub-titles are good overall, but I won't comment on the dubbing other than to say that I am not fond of English language dubs and I prefer to watch in the original Japanese.",1400544000,,831,4.405228758169935

2165991,5,B000641Z40,"Lupin III is one of the only anime series that I love and I have been a faithful fan since 2003. Like many Americans I was introduced to it through Adult Swim's airings of the second series and from there enjoyed purchasing the movies and sets from Geneon and Funimation. Discotek continues to live up to that proud tradition by releasing some of the earlier television specials, starting with 1989's ""Bye Bye, Lady Liberty"".

The plot is typical Lupin, complete with silliness and all of the unusual gadgets that we've come to love and expect. He steals the Statue of Liberty (using nothing more than a giant balloon, no less), evades captors by using explosive rubber ducks (yes, you read that properly) and battles a strange cult that has some kind of supernatural powers that flow from a creepy old guy. Sound ridiculous? It is and it's a blast. Fans love Lupin because it's fun and never takes itself too seriously. Adventure, mayhem, comedy, and a small amount of drama has always been a winning formula for this series and this release showcases them all wonderfully. The story does drag a bit in places and the plot isn't the strongest, yet it's a fun special and one that fans will most likely find enjoyable to some degree.

As always, the special features and presentation are top notch. Discotek has always done this franchise justice and we're treated to the original Japanese sub as well as the 1996 English dub. The dub is serviceable but the character voices seem off, a step down from the great subs by Geneon and Funimation, but it's nice to have it included and as the story progresses you begin to get used to the quirky voices. The liner notes and other small extras are great to have as well. The sound and picture are stellar too.

It's great to see this series getting the treatment it deserves and hopefully more viewers here in America will catch on to this legendary franchise. Major kudos to Discotek for keeping up with these releases and I am already eagerly awaiting their next release.",1396828800,9,2017,4.676056338028169
2165992,5,B000641Z40,"Discotek's done an amazing job with Lupin releases since beginning them in 2007, and Bye Bye Lady Liberty is no exception. The very first TV special may have some unintentional comedy due to computer technology changing so much in 25 years, but the core storyline is still enjoyable. Visually, it's a stunning film, and the included commentary by ANN's Mike Toole helps explain why. Normally, either Reed Nelson or the duo from Lupin Has Three Jackets would do one, but Reed stuck with doing the liner notes, and Mike and Ryan put their commentary online due to some recording problems. It's out now and well-worth listening to. The liner notes go into great detail about the plot, the meaning behind some things, and includes some thoughts on the movie as well. The movie does include the Manga UK English dub, and while it does feature some odd things for a movie that takes places throughout the U.S. (like the use of kilometers during an early scene), it's an excellent dub overall and most of the main characters sound correct to the ear - no one other than Michael gets grating. If you're a Lupin fan from its days on Adult Swim, the tone here is a bit more dramatic at times, but the overall pacing and feel is like the red jacket series. Some may find it difficult to justify spending $20+ on a DVD of one movie in 2014 in the age of digital distribution and complete series sets for $30, but this is definitely worth its asking price.",1395792000,6,1443,4.553846153846154

2165994,4,B000641Z40,"I am a huge Lupin the 3rd fan, and recenlty I have been trying to beef up my collection. I was thrilled to pick this movie up on Amazon, and it was pretty good.

The overall plot of the movie, involves Lupin and the gang trying to steal a national treasure from an ruthless 3rd world country dictator/general. Along the way, Lupin meets up with some allies, and as usual, he meets up with the Femme Fatale' Fujiko. I won't spoil the story, but overall the plot ws pretty engaging. Personally, I found that the plots from ""Castle of Cagliostro"" and ""Farewell to Nostradamus"" a bit more engaging and captivating, but this movie is still very enjoyable.

The english voice acting for this movie is pretty good. For some weird reason, my opinion always hinges on performance of the actor potraying Jiggen, perhaps because he is my favorite character. I think the actor in this movie did a worlds better than the actor in the ""Casle of Cagliostro"" , but not quite as good as the actor in ""Farewell to Nostradamus.""

This disc is distributed by Funimation, and unlike my previous Lupin movie from them, the disc was in great condition, and worked perfectly. In my opinion Funimation does the best job in brigning Lupin to English speaking audiences.

A great buy for any Lupin fan, and like any Lupin movie, I thnink this a great buy for anyone who wants to give the anime genre a chance, without having to subject themselves to crazy hairstyles, and strange magical rodents.",1345852800,,1469,4.638461538461539

There is no way you could possibly  resist a second or even third look at any of the wonderful movies in this collection.

2165996,5,B000641Z40,"I would respectfully disagree with several of the ""reviews"" posted here, this is a fantastic movie and another great Lupin III experience. This is one of the most important anime series that has come from the amazing universe of Japanese animation, many in the West do not realize that animation in Japan continues a long long tradition of stylized art from the woodblock tradition and therefore it has deep roots in their culture....and has much more depth than Western animation in many ways. Lupin III series has the added feature of being so well designed and written that it is fun and funny and exciting all at once. This movie is just as good as any of them, and of the more than 20 movie length features and the 14 dubbed this is one of the best. You won't regret buying it and will watch it many times I am sure.

The voicing is by the way superb, and for an english speaker there is just no real reason to claim to prefer the Japanese language version, I read and speak some Japanese but it is not my native tongue and there is no way for us to grasp all the nuances and implications of the Japanese language version without being qualified translators or totally literate in both languages. So sit back and enjoy what is a great dubbing job and enjoy the show.

2165997,3,B000641Z40,"I like Lupin so I wouldn't miss a movie. This one has all the basic plot points covered yet again. Nothing new, Lupin's dead yet again, Fujiko rips off the team, yet again.

Truthfully if you miss this one you aren't any worse off. Everything felt half hearted, including the ending. There isn't really any fan service in this movie. While never needed for the story, it was still a slight disappointment. Likewise the music, which is normally a highlight for me, was mundane at best.

If your looking for a ""off into the sunset"" movie where things get wrapped up, this is not it for the series. I doubt they will ever do that for Lupin.

The voice acting itself, (English dub) was on par with recent Funimation Lupin movies, nothing great but ok.

2165999,3,B000641Z40,"What amazes and dismays me most about the entire Lupin III series is how after ( in this case ) over 20 years there has been virtually NO growth or development in any of these characters.  It's as if the entire production is on auto-pilot.  What changes there have been are both cosmetic and confusing.  Of course Lupin's original seyuu is dead, replaced by an adequate substitute; but the changes to other cast members, notably Fujiko, are puzzling: though voiced by the same actress, she no longer looks anything like the original Fujiko.  Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon fare better in this respect; and Zenegata appears as he has more recently, after his character's alteration for the second TV series.  Still, the animation varies widely in this so-called ""movie"", which was really a Japanese TV special.

Of course all the necessary plot devices are in place: something mysterious to be stolen; a curveacious rival to be tricked; Zenegata-Keibu likewise; impossible car chases and near-death experiences for our hero; lots of bad guys to be offed; an implacably evil villian; what are supposed to represent various ""exotic"" settings; etc., etc.  Basically, if you've ever seen ANY version of Lupin, then you've seen all of this before; I found myself looking at the time more than once as I waited out its all-too-inevetable conclusion.  The only part of this I actually ENJOYED was the over-the-top reaction of Zenegata to this latest ""death"" of Lupin; but even that's nothing really new.  I suppose when you have a franchise that's as popular in its native land as this one is, you don't DARE change ANYTHING.

It's not that it's really SO bad; there's just very little in it to arouse interest, and certainly nothing new.  In an attempt to be ""hip"" with its New York City location, including lots of signage and secondary dialogue in English, it is thereby dated with several unfortunate views of the pre- 9/11 Twin Towers.  Of course this is no fault of the 2000 production; but I found myself most amused by watching for other various legitimate audio-visual bloopers.  For example, it's quite obvious that Sandy, the ""great"" torch singer that Lupin has the hots for this time, though represented as an American singing in a New York lounge, is singing phonetically - and poorly at that - having NO command of English.  Also, she has her name boldly displayed outside the club: ""SUNDAY""!  These are perfect examples of the great care that was lavished on this production!",1225670400,,2476,4.889952153110048

Please do yourself a favor and watch this in Japanese with the original 1989 cast. The UK dub isn't great. I don't mind it in english versions in the Lupin the Third saga, they change, and that's totally cool with me. I didn't care for this one. It definitely has the Lupin goodness we all know and love. I am happy to add this to my collection. Thank you!",1504828800,,455,4.170454545454546

8038335,4,B000641Z40,"Released way back in 1989, Bye Bye, Lady Liberty was the very first Lupin the 3rd made for television movie. This is one of four Lupin movies released by Eastern Star since March 2014 but the only one with an English dubbing. My assumption is that Eastern Star does not do its own dubbing and Bye Bye Lady Liberty is the only one that just happened to have already been dubbed. As far as I know this is the first time the film has been released in the US and the dubbing was done for a UK/AUS release.

If you're excited to have dubbing don't be. For one thing because of copyright issues Lupin is referred to as Wolf throughout the movie. Second, the voice acting is not very good. About the only one who did a decent job was the woman who voiced Fujiko. Goemons voice was the worst or as hes referred to in this dubbing, Gomen. But if you find the dubbing unlistenable just use the original Japanese version with English subtitles. Im not going to ding the movie for including a lousy dubbing since the original audio is available just as in the other Lupin movies.

Despite being the iconic moment of the film the theft of the Statue of Liberty is somewhat silly. Lupin (Wolf) steals Lady Liberty in order to find the Super Egg (an enormous gem) that is hidden somewhere in or on the famous statue. Having the 151 foot tall statue in his possession gives Lupin the opportunity to search in relative leisure.  Once the Super Egg is found the statue is basically gone from the plot. Things then get very complicated. The villains are a group of cultists led by a 120 year old occultist with true magic powers and deadly breath. Not only does the cadaverous villain want the Super Egg he also wants something called the Manipulative Virus which was created by the mother of a young genius whos been hanging out with Jigen and Lupin while the mother has been travelling with Goemon whos been acting as her protector.

There are a lot of gears in the plot, perhaps too many. The film has its moments but I would not put it among my favorites in the Lupin series. The animation is inconsistent and Im not a huge fan of stories that bring in actual magical powers since they seem inconsistent with the tone of Lupin series. Ill give the movie four stars but suggest watching it with subtitles.",1442448000,,2289,4.4299287410926365
8038336,4,B000641Z40,"The movie starts with Lupin bidding in an auction for a seemingly worthless ring. To the shock of those at the auction the price soars to over a million and Lupin loses by a single dollar because for some reason the auction abruptly ends. We find out later that the ring along with its matching broach are magic artifacts capable of bestowing to the owner the ability to rule the world. Men like Napoleon, Lenin and Hitler all owed their rise to power to the jewelry. Ohh kay.

Missed by a Dollar, released in 2000, was the twelfth Lupin the 3rd made for TV movie. It was directed by Hideki Tonokatsu who also directed the next film, Alcatraz Connection. The animation is decent although sometimes sloppy. Its interesting how much the animation varies not only in quality but in overall look from film to film. My guess is the different directors bring in their own animators and in the case of the Lupin films the directors change from film to film more often than not.

My biggest issue with the film is the plot. We start with a broach and ring combination that can rule the world and then the film swerves off into oil fraud and stock manipulation. There is some kind of Spectre type organization and an attempt to create a phony war and the broach/ring are completely forgotten about. There are Lupin films like Crisis in Tokyo that are so hilarious and well done that I completely overlook the muddled plot but Missed by a Dollar isn't quite good enough to overcome a forgettable story.

I don't want to imply that the film is bad and there are some very good sequences including a classic Lupin car chase. All the characters are handled properly and given sufficient screen time. I was a bit confused early on because the voice actress for one of the female villains was so close to the voice actress for Fujiko that I started confusing the two. There is also a weird scene right at the end. Lupin is sometimes shown as being incredibly skillful but this scene takes it to a totally absurd level. Our thief hero is walking out of a bar with the broach and the female villain pulls a gun on Lupin. With his back turned to her about twenty feet away he effortlessly flips a coin backwards having it land between the gun and the hammer jamming it so it cant fire. I literally had to rewind the movie twice to figure out what I was seeing. Missed by a Dollar is a fine addition to the Lupin series but I would only place it as a middle of the road Lupin film.",1439769600,,2462,4.406593406593407
