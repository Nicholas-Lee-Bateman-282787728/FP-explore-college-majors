Bela is the star, of course, in this classic ""horror"" film as Tod Browning went to the well one more time in great success. The plot / storyline, writing is fabulous.

8220068,3,B000VUNVVE,"Well--if all the classic horror books I've read over the years are true--then ""Mark of the Vampire"" takes its source material from Lon Chaney's lost film ""London After Midnight."" And that may be where the biggest problem with this film comes from. I don't think I'm giving anything away from a movie this old--but the plot twist that Bela and Carol's characters are not ""actual"" vampires, but rather paid actors in some half baked plot to expose the real killer of the film is very disappointing for an old school horror fan like me.

In fact, if you're one who is viewing this primarily for the presence of Lugosi, then you can't help but feel let down--this is more like one of Bela's ""red herring"" roles where he was cast more for his name value on the marquee.

Of course, all the actors are fine in their roles, but why this film had to dodge ""real"" vampires--particularly in the wake of Bela's success about 4 years earlier as the ""real Count Dracula"" for Universal Pictures is beyond me.

Overall, I would say it's not a terrible film by any means, but not one I may revisit for many repeat viewings.

8220070,4,B000VUNVVE,"In 1935's MARK OF THE VAMPIRE Tod Browning, notorious director of ghoulish cinema, rains terror on a remote Czechoslovakian village. It's not the first time he's done this. MARK OF THE VAMPIRE is a retelling of his 1927 silent film LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT. It sucks for posterity that no print now exists of LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, that only a slideshow of still photos remains to recreate the thing (aired thus on TCM some weeks ago). But MARK OF THE VAMPIRE is a near scene-for-scene remake, only it takes three actors - Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Lionel Barrymore - to sub for Lon Chaney. Chaney, in LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, played all three of their roles. It's why he's all sorts of awesome.

Eastern European folklore, on how to dispose of vampires: ""Their heads must be severed with one clean stroke and a sprig of bat-thorn placed within the gaping wound!"" When Inspector Neumann (Atwill) of the Prague constabulary is summoned to a tiny village in the mountains to investigate a rash of unsettling events, he pooh-poohs the wild assertions made by the resident physician (Donald Meek), a learned man predisposed to supernatural twaddle. Inspector Neumann takes in the corpse drained of blood and the bite marks on the throat, and he cannot countenance the doctor's insistence of vampires. Scoffs Neumann: ""Forget your absurd superstitions. This is 1934!"" And yet as the case unfolds, Neumann begins to second guess himself. Perhaps the preponderance of otherworldly evidence proves too incontrovertible to dismiss? Perhaps Professor Zelen (Barrymore), him what's an expert of the occult and who takes an interest in the case, comes off that convincing? Is that bat-thorn in your hand, Inspector?

Am I giving something away when I muse that elements of the ""Old Dark House"" creep into the narrative?  What isn't up for debate is cinematographer James Wong Howe's haunting aesthetics. His camera evokes an eerie, disquieting mood as it documents those misty graveyards and vermin-riddled crypts and an alarming moonlit vision of the pallid Luna (Carroll Borland). Bela Lugosi is here somewhere, skulking about in his standard midnight duds. Surprise, surprise, Luna and Lugosi (as ""Count Mora"") embody the frightful folk tales surrounding them demons of the castle.

Browning gleefully raids his horror bag of tropes: the flapping bats, the maiden in the trance, hysterical peasants, ominous vaults... oh, the vaults. Groan along with me when one character remarks: ""We must search the vaults beneath the old ruins."" Let me tell you, when the nosferatu are in play, I tend to flat-out ignore those brave souls who say, ""We must search the vaults beneath the old ruins."" You search the vaults, mister. You go toe to toe with the scary man in the opera cape. Me, I'm online ordering up some bat-thorns.

Beware the twisty plot. You must pay attention. This is a vampire tale with a third act swerve. Water cooler talk has it that Tod Browning kept the actors in the dark about the ending. And no wonder. It upends everything. It's this neat ending that really separates MARK OF THE VAMPIRE from the rest of the pack. That final scene is so unexpected I couldn't help but give out a startled, delighted ""Hah!"" And, somewhen, a young M. Night Shyamalan saw this film and probably went, ""Huh."" And then light bulb.",1384732800,,3313,4.972924187725631
8220071,4,B000VUNVVE,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rare foray into the horror genre was this sound remake of the regrettably lost ""London After Midnight"" (1927). In truth, director Tod Browning's ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) resembles a murder-mystery with gothic sequences - beautifully rendered by cinematographer James Wong Howe. A hammy Lionel Barrymore proves no match for Edward Van Sloan, but the vampiric presence of Bela Lugosi and Carroll Borland remains downright chilling. Though a bit dialogue heavy, ""Mark of the Vampire"" is slicker and more atmospheric than the Browning-Lugosi ""Dracula"" (1931).",1380067200,2,581,5.767441860465116
8220072,3,B000VUNVVE,"The scenes of Bela Lugosi and some cool looking young vampire chick creeping around their castle and in the fog of the grave yard while eerie music plays is enough to make this movie a must see for fans of classic horror. The atmoshere of the film is creepy and ambient. With the local villagers frightened of the castle where Bela Lugosi ""lives"" makes you feel like you're watching a prequel to Dracula. And the female vampire changing from a bat is so cool. How'd they do that?

However, just as you're starting to feel as if you've just discovered a lesser known vampire flick on par with Dracula, Nosferatu, or Salem's Lot the plot twists and then becomes not so great.....

I'm not going to give away the surprise ending but I must warn you its laaaaaaaaaaame. As a horror fan the ending of the movie is a huge disapointment but that doesn't take away from some of the creepy atmospheres and great acting. Not as cool as I thought it would be but worth getting if its cheap.

Historically, this movies important because its a remake of the famous lost film, London After Midnight. London After Midnight was also directed by Todd Browning and starred Lon Chaney (who was going to play Dracula in the 1931 classic before he became terminally ill). No known copies exist today and is probably the most sought after lost film of all time. Definetly the most sought after lost horror film. Also of significance is that it shares the same director and star (and possibly castle) as Dracula.

A good description would be Dracula meets Clue.",1333670400,,1538,4.602189781021898
8220073,5,B000VUNVVE,Mark of the Vampire is one those vampire movies that deserve classic status because of the unusual ending for a horror movie. Any fan of Bela Lugosi will not want to miss this one. You will be surprised. Excellent movie making.,1305331200,3,227,4.560975609756097
8220074,3,B000VUNVVE,"Mark of the Vampire (Tod Browning, 1935)

Hollywood's obsession with vampires is nothing new, though it does tend to run in stages. The first big vampire craze happened during the early thirties. Sure, vampire movies had been made before, some of them now recognized classics (look no further than Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens, Murnau's 1922 game-changer that introduced a radical new concept: the pan shot). but it was Tod Browning's Dracula, in 1931, that kicked things off. Suddenly, vampires were everywhere, and it was inevitable that Browning would get pulled back into the craze. After all, Browning had visited that mythology before Dracula, even (1927's London After Midnight, considered one of the world's great lost films). And thus we have Mark of the Vampire, an amusing, if minor, film Browning made towards the end of his career. (It is quite possible the film is actually better than what we've seen; MGM cut twenty minutes of footage before the film's release, which contain, as far as anyone can tell, a great deal of backstory.)

We open with a murder, as we often do, and the investigation surrounding it. This is led by the slightly cracked Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), who is convinced the victim was killed by a vampire. This leads to a houseful of paranoid guests. Things get worse when the supposed vampires, Count Mora (Lugosi--how could he not be in this movie?) and  his daughter Luna (Carroll Borland, who made only five films in her career--three in the thirties and two in the eighties), start hanging around throwing scares into people. Zelen, along with the local doctor, Inspector Neumann (Lionel Atwill) of the local constabulary, and Irena (Elizabeth Allan, from the 1935 David Copperfield), the victim's daughter, have to figure out what's really going on before everyone ends up dead. Or worse.

I can't tell you what's really going on, of course, for that would spoil the surprise, but Mark of the Vampire is not the horror movie you were expecting from the director of Dracula, not at all. Whether this has to do with Browning or MGM is never quite established; Freaks, Browning's last film, had been a box office disaster, and Browning had no say in the changes MGM made to the finished film. How much of that deleted footage would have made this the classic you can sometimes feel lurking beneath the surface, rather than the potboiler/comedy that it is? It's not a bad film; after all, Browning directed it. But it is not one of his better works, even if that's not entirely is fault. Worth checking out for fans of Browning, Lugosi, Atwill, etc., but no need to go out of your way. ** ",1282608000,2,2645,4.855875831485587
8220075,4,B000VUNVVE,"Released in 1935 and directed by Tod Browning, Mark of the Vampire is actually a remake of Tod Browning's very own silent movie London After Midnight, which starred Lon Chaney Sr. and is now a lost film. No known copies of London After Midnight are around anymore and if there is one left who knows what condition it would now be in. Some guy using the original screenplay put together London After Midnight using a new score and still photos, but that while interesting doesn't quite cut it so Mark of the Vampire is the only way to sort of see London After Midnight.

Tod Browning made a name for himself in the 20s with a slew of silent flicks, which starred Lon Chaney Sr. and his popularity grew in 1931 when he directed the classic Dracula with Bela Lugosi in the title role and Browning was a director with a lot of pull until Freaks. While now seen as a cult classic upon its release Freaks was panned by critics and fans a like and pretty much destroyed Tod Browning's career. Freaks was banned in several countries including the United States. Mark of the Vampire was a way to resurrect his career and while a decent hit it didn't do much for his career.

Tod Browning is re-teamed with Bela Lugosi and I personally think Mark of the Vampire is a lot better than Dracula and almost as good as Freaks. Mark of the Vampire is a murder/mystery with a horror twist. This movie rates as one of my very favorite horror flicks from the 30s and one of my favorite vampire flicks.

The screenplay by Guy Endore & Bernard Schubert is well written overall and makes a quite interesting premise, in which vampires are suspected of a murder and the script does a solid job with the vampire lore. The characters are ok, but the movie is well enough written to make up for any lack of character development.

Even though the script is good what makes this such a classic is the direction by Tod Browning. He creates quite an eerie movie. I just love the look of horror movies from the 30s they always seem to have this creepy vibe and with such a talented director like Tod Browning it makes it all the better. This is the type of movie that without the right director can be boring, but it never is thanks to Tod Browning. Mark of the Vampire only runs at about 60-minutes so it has to move at a quick pace and thankfully does.

I remember reading once during the making of Dracula, Browning had a little bit of trouble directing the dialogue scene; I don't know if that's true or not, but the best scenes of Dracula in my opinion are the ones with no talking so I suppose it could be true. But true or not, Browning doesn't have that problem here, but the scenes in which there is no talking as the vampires roam around are by far the best due to the creep factor.

The mystery angle works well, but it's the vampire scenes that elevate this; Lugosi is excellent as Count Mora even though he has no dialogue at all until the end of the movie. He's quite creepy though as he watches and stalks, but it's Carroll Borland as his daughter Luna Mora that steals the show. She just looked downright creepy and the scenes with her walking in the graveyard are quite chilling.

About the only problem is the twist in the movie; the twist is hailed by some as brilliant and others as horrible and I agree with both actually. The twist is fairly smart and you won't see it coming, but the problem is it sort of rules everything that came before it kind of pointless. I really can't say much since I'd ruin the movie and if you know the twist going into the movie you won't enjoy it as much. It's one of those twists you'll love or hate it since again it does sort of make what came before pointless, but personally I liked the twist. At first I didn't and I disliked the movie due to it, but seeing Mark of the Vampire again I've grown to like the twist and without the plot twist I don't think this would have been as good.

There are problems with the twist where you wonder why all that was went through and start to question scenes due to the movie contradicting itself, but don't think about it too much and just take it all in as Mark of the Vampire is an excellent movie and one of Tod Browning's very best pictures.",1227484800,3,4210,4.313527180783818
