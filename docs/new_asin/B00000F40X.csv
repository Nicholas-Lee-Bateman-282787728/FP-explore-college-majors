It isn't a story to watch if you can't pay close attention to facial expressions, details, emotions...  But my friend and I  watched this movie seven times in two weeks.  I would have seen it again,  but it was gone so quickly!  Every frame was thought out perfectly, and  the more I saw the movie, the more details I noticed in the background.  Both the directing and the acting were spectacular.  And the  soundtrack/score is just beautiful.  I hope it is released for sale soon...

1204179,1,B00000F40X,"If you are simply a fan of Ashley Judd or Ewan MacGregor, then you will probably like this film.  If, however, you want a great psychological thriller with great actors, look elsewhere.  Most people misunderstood this  movie because they did not catch on to the true nature of Ashley and Ewan's  relationship (there was only one real clue, and it was at the end).  Once  you realize that relationship, then the movie makes some sense when you  consider Ashley's and Ewan's actions.  But that completely throws reality  out the door because the time frame of the movie would be absolutely wrong.  If you consider the more commonly taken relationship between Askley and  Ewan, then their actions in the movie make no sense, and the plot is  pointless.  The actors and director do everything they can to make this  picture worth watching, but it is impossible to simply watch this movie for  its art, and ignore the plot.",954374400,2,918,4.75796178343949
1204180,1,B00000F40X,"EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, is the type of art film that tries despretley to be original, but in doing that messes itself up all together. Now i like Ashley Judd, i think she is a great actress, but i wonder why she would  choose such a pointless movie, that only sees her as a demonic, and  vengful, how should i put this, whore. Her and Ewan McGregor have done  outstanding films in their time, but the chemistry and articulstion between  the two goes nowhere, and nowhere fast. Katy Lang and Jason Preisley show  up for no reason, except to seduce people's attention towards this  unseductive film.

1204181,4,B00000F40X,"I believe that this film has succumb to the same fate that Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' did - poor/misleading ad campaigns.  I had heard nothing about this film before I went to see it. All I knew was that it starred  Ewan McGregor - and as a fan of the actor who knows the type of films he is  usually associated with (Trainspotting, The Pillow Book, Rogue Trader) I  was not expecting this to be a simple or easy film at all. And thankfully,  it was not.
I absolutely loved the film and its case study on a man who  against his better judgment falls in love with a serial killer. The visuals  and characters were all very interesting and while there were a few parts  that I found boring, my attention did not wander far.  I overheard many,  *many*, people say that the film was boring and pointless as they left the  theater. Not until I saw the trailers did I realize why so many people were  disappointed with the film. It makes the movie appear to be a fast paced  thriller - and 'Eye' most certainly *is not*.  Ultimately, this is going  to be a personal call. If you like complex and (above all else) off-beat  films that require you to think, then this is certainly for you. If,  however, you prefer explosions and constant gun-fights (I am not suggesting  there is anything wrong with that - hell, I'm also a big John Woo fan :),  then I would suggest passing on this. Or at least waiting for the video  release.",950140800,39,1420,4.326996197718631

1204292,5,B00000F40X,"This is a sad, eerily romantic, beautifully scened film. It's a bit Hitchcockian but with a modern, existentialistic type of sad, buttered with a needy romanticism. That probably sounds complicated, but this film is complicated in regards to emotions. Though framed in a simple action thriller plot, this film pulls on the heartstrings of the dark parts of my heart. I watch this film easily once a year when my mood steers towards depressed, and the drive to escape my day-to-day overcomes me. Joanna Eris is an extremely complex individual that slips easily from one identity to another. I would envy her if not for the murdering parts.

I rarely leave film reviews, but I just had to in this case. I'm not sure why so many didn't like this movie. It's one of my favorites. And yes, I love Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Color Purple, etc. The point being usually my opinion isn't completely out of sync with top reviewers. Apparently, this one is the exception. Rotten Tomatoes gives a 9% with the critic consensus being 'improbable and muddled'. I found the plot line perfectly linear and cohesive. Perhaps the technologies were a bit impractical but really, that's not the point of the movie. Do James Bond movies get down-rated for this? No. Or most psychological thrillers? Definitely not. If you're in the mood for a twisted romance and a bit of an escape from your reality, this is one to watch.",1489795200,2,1403,4.773662551440329

I won't make that mistake again. If you like dark movies about contemptible characters who lead worthless lives, then go for it. There are plenty of reviews that discuss the characters and plot, so I won't bother. One of the reviews I did read - after the fact, unfortunately - said this movie is not for everybody. Definitely not. I don't look for sweetness and light and Little Miss Sunshine characters in my movies. I expect characters to have flaws and make bad decisions - occasionally, not every time you turn around. I mean, seriously, if you deliberately load your gun with blanks because you know if you bring the woman in your house, she's going to try to shoot you, is this a woman you really want to be with?

I've read some of the reviews and just don't understand why others didn't feel the characters didn't develop or some of their actions weren't explained. Several different times the Judd character is explained or parts of her character further revealed. While McGregor's character is obvious - a descent into obsession and madness. Two forces destined for a collision course.  But unfortunately like in some other movies, they try so desperately to keep the ending dark. The ending stunk.

1204392,1,B00000F40X,"Eye of the Beholder, 1999 film

A man is watching another man to see what he does. He follows him at a distance. He sees a woman join him in his house. There is a crime! Next he follows Dorothy Bishop on a train to NY city. A man talks to her; later this man stops talking! This woman is followed. What is she up to? [This seems like a weird story adapted from a novel. Why is there an imaginary young girl, Lucy, in these scenes?] Debra is told about a boy friend who is following her. A detective follows Debra, who meets another man. He learns she has a record as Joanna Eris. Then le leaves on a plane trip. There is electronic surveillance again. Now he is in Boston asking about Joanna Eris. Was she ever molested?

Now he is in California tracking Eris. She meets Mr. Leonard, blind and wealthy. [Believable? Can he warn this man? Will rifle shots stop that car? There is an accident. Eris moves on and meets a new man. When they are alone he plays rough. The watcher intervenes. [Is this believable?] Then there is a surprise! The watcher calls for help in finding Eris. He finds her in a hospital bed, asleep, and puts a ring on her finger. Then he leaves. He looked like a salesman. Later he follows her, then she follows him. Police try to arrest her, but shots stop this. Next there is a scene at a diner. Frank reads a horoscope from a newspaper. Two men stop, eat, and leave. Later Frank talks to Liz, who talks about her losses. So does Frank. Those two men return with a  woman who can identify Joanna, who drops a tray. Frank and Joanna return to his trailer. There is a shot, Joanna drives away. Joannas car crashes into a frozen lake! Frank rescues her. Goodbye. The story ends.

This is one of the weirdest movies that Ive ever seen, but still entertains. It has a series of disconnected scenes tied together by the same actors. What is the story? Was the book better? Recreating the crime tests the testimony of eyewitnesses and exposes any implausibilities. So a written story may appear believable, but having it played shows its implausibility. Was the producer or director sober when they filmed it?",1423353600,,2124,4.410714285714286
1204393,4,B00000F40X,"""Eye of the Beholder"" (1999) details British Consulate investigator  i.e. spy  codenamed Eye (Ewan McGregor) and his increasing obsession with a Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd), a joyless psychotic who hates certain men because, apparently, her daddy abandoned her as a little girl at Christmas. Eye's obsession helps him forget the ghosts of his past  his wife and daughter who abandoned him (or vice versa). So he quits his job to follow Joanna around the country as she murders wealthy men; that is, until she finds a man who CAN'T see who she really is, literally. The chase leads to Alaska where

Jason Priestley has a small role as a jerk in the desert whereas Genevive Bujold plays the counselor at the orphanage where Joanna grew-up. It's nice to see the latter. For insights into the story pay close attention to the relationship of Joanna and the doctor, which I don't interpret as Sapphic, but as quasi-mother/daughter. Interpreting it as Sapphic is possible, but it's an extreme position with not enough support to back it up.

People love to loathe this movie and it's obvious why: The two protagonists are psychotics and it's hard for the average person to relate to them. Another negative is some unbelievable elements, like: Wouldn't someone notice Eye camping out in the bell tower of a city church? How would he have the field know-how to get away with doing the things he does when the opening act reveals him as essentially a computer nerd who rarely goes outside? Would two Federal detectives really bring the counselor of the orphanage all the way to friggin' Alaska to determine if a waitress is Joanna?

If you can handle these script flaws, however, ""Eye of the Beholder"" is a stylishly-made thriller with haunting aspects and a superb soundtrack/score. Even though it's hard to relate to or even like the protagonists the chase around the country maintains your interest in an entrancing manner. The movie's worth catching just for these reasons, not to mention Ashley Judd was one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet at the time (and still is) and she appears in some pretty skimpy outfits, uber-sullen though she may be in the role. Ashley's thoroughly convincing and proves her talent beyond question.

I think there's something deeper going on with the story as well: Eye goes through the same voyeuristic process in his life inside the movie that we just so happen to be watching, as voyeurs. Note how much of what Eye sees is through a camera lens and into people's private lives.

The film was based on the novel by Marc Behm wherein Eye was much older and Joanna, roughly the age his daughter would've been. This was changed for the movie where it appears Eye is romantically fascinated with Joanna, despite her murdering spree, and he feels the need to watch over her and save her, which he failed to do as a father with his daughter. In any case, Stephen Elliott wrote the screenplay and directed the film, but was beset at every turn by the studio ""suits"" who financed the picture. At one point during the stress of filming, Elliott had to check himself into a psychiatric hospital for succor! This is relayed in Lizzy Gardiner's excellent documentary ""Killing Priscilla"" (2000). Thankfully, he was able to finish the picture. The fact that everyone hates it and it bombed at the box office probably sent him back to the institution.

BOTTOM LINE: Yes, the plot's outlandish, the characters are whack-jobs and there are some eye-rolling plot holes, but the countrywide chase and stylish filmmaking are hypnotic, haunting and entertaining.

The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in California, Quebec, New York City, Pittsburgh and D.C.

1204394,5,B00000F40X,"At first i was skeptical about buying this movie, I'd heard that critics reviews weren't exactly praising it, rather scathing actually. But I gave in because I thought it might be a little Like Hitchcock's 'Vertigo.' I was surprised by the artsy flavor of the film, the director chose to utilize a lot of evocative, convincing, and more than slightly interesting camera angles in the telling of this story. While the plot came across as rather convoluted, and hard to figure out if there was any underlying meaning. Eye of the Beholder presents the viewer with so much information--and in such an unusual way--that long after the credits have rolled and the movie screen is black, your mind is still chewing on the delightfully, tightly knotted, and tangled premise behind the content. While i wasn't always sure where the director was trying to lead me with this story, i kept on watch (if only for the fact that the cinematography was unique had a definite Hitchcock flavor)--yes that's right there are a few shots of peoples feet walking around in this film. visually I felt like this film was a masterpiece. The actors gave good performances; even though, Ewan McGregor's was a little lackluster through most of the film; he did his best at the very end, in the scene where he rolls down a snowbank coughing like a smashed bat. if it weren't for Ashley Judd's convincing portrayal of a scheming, icy, seductress, with a subtle vulnerability, who rejects McGregor's help, then the movie's main character would have fallen flat. There is an obvious reference to Vertigo, easily noticeable, especially in the scene where the director deliberately focuses on certain San Francisco landmarks that Hitchcock used in his film. Also they added a neat little toast to the Vertigo ripoff, 'Obsession' by giving a character part to the lead actress from that film. If you don't enjoy this movie's strange story, and are driven to commit murder by the nonsensically overblown musical score--which leaves much to be desired--then you can at least revel in the Hitchcockian style, and loose yourself in the immaculate visual style of this film.",1418342400,6,2134,4.947075208913649

I think this may be one of Ashley Judd's first full headlining roles and it seems she had free reign to flesh out the character - which she did quite well. Bizarrely absorbing - check, riveting entertainment - check, complete with haun ting lost love theme song - check.

This is perhaps the least formulaic movie you will ever see.  It is also an extremely difficult story to tell because both of the two leading characters suffer from mental illnesses, and both of the characters behave badly.  Two excellent actors who have always been able to gain sympathy for their characters from the viewing audiences were absolutely essential to the success of this movie, and Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor were great choices for the roles.  At its heart, Eye of the Beholder is a love story---a very sad love story----and an incredibly unique love story.  The low overall ratings shown by Amazon are unfair.  Viewers give movies low ratings when they do not get what they wanted from watching the movies.  In this case the two famous and beautiful actors never even kiss each other.  Furthermore, they don't even talk to each other until the final scenes.  That's got to be disappointing for a lot of viewers.  However, it does not make this a bad movie.

of effort, thought and artistic vision is brought to the VISUAL aspects

to the movie. The colors, the daylight, night light, the scenarios,

the mood that the time of a day can impact people.

It also has a European feel, which is welcome, in terms of emotion,

and a kind of burnout or depression that some people go through at

certain times of their lives, such as a mid-life crisis.

I agree that the actor, Ewan McGregor, being a young fella, throws

the story off-track, in terms of the type of relationship that is

suggested between the spy-killer Ashley Judd and himself, a

MI5 surveillance agent. In the movie, the similar ages make them on-par

with each other, so that a romantic or sexual relationship is perhaps

seen as credible. In reality, the book had suggested a different

type of relationship, more of a chaste, father-daughter, protective

relationshop, an old man protecting a girl similar to his own daughter,

that he lost a long time ago, in a nostalgic fashion. This will confuse

many viewers, but perhaps ...for those purely looking superficially,

will be more tasteful, to streer clear of any possible incestuous

relationship or old man with young girl controversy that otherwise

could have occurred had the movie's director not chosen Ewan McGregor.

There's plenty of action, plenty of talent and charisma shown by

Ashley Judd, so, for fans of this actress,  and fans of ""visual movies""

that try to seduce you by the ""mood"" is presents, it's great.

For those looking for a more objective, literal, plausible story,

Ewan is some kind of agent who watches people who just becomes infatuated with Ashley and becomes her protector even though she is out murdering people.  Ewan is off in another world anyway, having conversations with a little girl (I believe is his dead sister) who isn't really there.

To be fair, I can see where the story would turn off a number of people. The co- lead, Ewan McGregory's character, is odd and not very credible. k.d. lang's character is unlikable, there is some stupid numerology as part of the story and the ending is unsatisfying .

Problem is, nothing much happens of this premise. We never find ourselves feeling for the agent or his liege. No romantic overtures with dangerous undertones. No edge of the seat interactions ala Sharon Stone films of the early 90s.

1204604,3,B00000F40X,"I have a slight advantage writing this review as the DVD with the director's commentary is playing in the background. Apparently this was based on  40's style pulp fiction he read while filming Priscilla and decided immediately that it would be his next film.

It took 7 years to get the financing, asking for a $20 million budget he ended up with $11 million and financed much of it himself. That alone should put up warning lights.

The cast has little to work with. Almost the entire film is made in Montreal in winter and edited to death. There is even an entire scene of Ewan McGregor in drag that is just barely visible if you follow the director's commentary on the DVD version. The film itself is so low budget that he fills in as a double for several characters on several scenes and Ashley Judd's wardrobe was nearly a third of the ENTIRE budget.

The premise is that a man called the eye (McGregor) who is some sort of technical spy is so wrapped up in his job that he doesn't even realize his wife has left with his daughter for weeks. She's apparently gone several years and he is still not quite right in the head over it when he is assigned to follow the Ashley Judd character. For some reason he becomes obsessed with her to the point of helping her cover her tracks as a serial murderer.

The plot becomes absurd as his obsession deepens and the police begin to catch up with her. When he reveals himself and she betrays him it is almost as if the writer and director didn't know what to do and the movie just ends leaving nothing resolved and no questions answered.

Beholder is about obsession and loss and the slow loss of reason and the ability to see beyond what is right in front of you. It is a spiral into a strange psychosis shared by 2 people as seen from the opposing ends of a spyglass.

If you are into film noir and would like to try something diffent than the usual popcorn thriller this is an ok movie. If you just want entertainment without having to think about what is or isn't happening then don't get this, it definetly won't appeal to you.",1117584000,5,2078,4.354005167958657

Ashley Judd plays in this the apparent routine female companion of a government official that a certain ""Eye"" (played by Ewen McGregor) is assigned to watch. But the ""Eye""'s assignment quickly ends prematurely. For Joanna Eris (Judd's character) out of a clear blue sky and without warning takes out a knife and stabs the subject of the ""Eye""'s assignment, killing him. Soon thereafter Ashley will go outside and quite literally show her behind. Love that or hate it, its entire significance will utterly pale in comparison to the way that Ashley Judd has an obsessive determination for figuratively showing her behind in this, like most every role she plays. Joanna Eris seems to have never done a pleasant or good thing in her life and apparently never will. Still the movie doesn't make her a villain, but somebody we're apparently supposed to somehow sympathize with, showing vaguely some inadequate explanation of her background and how it supposedly made her the monster she is. Having Ashley Judd play her makes it all the more lurid, as there is a parallel between Joanna's stubbornly entrenched but poorly explained evil and Judd's stubbornly entrenched but poorly explained determination to play unlikeable roles that figuratively (and sometimes less importantly but literally) show her behind. Ashley Judd must certainly prescribe to a dogma that that which comes out of her behind does not stink. But even more exasperatingly, on a figurative level, she seems to have an obsessive fixation on an attitude that the cinematic venom that comes out of her obsessive choice of lurid movie roles doesn't stink. By the way, the movie gets no better from the point where she stabs the man. He is probably not her first victim, and by no means her last within the course of the movie. The Eye, rather than clearly relaizing that his assignment has come to a premature end, starts trailing Joanna Eris, like she immediately became the object of his affections! Hence the movie's title, I would suppose. But it doesn't really designate anything worth watching. See if you must to satisfy your curiosity.

The movie chronicles Ewen McGregor's pursuit of Ashley Judd across the world, but it doens't really explain why.  There is an attempt to form a link between McGregor's now-gone wife and daughter and Ashley Judd, but that doesn't really hold up.  I mean, the odds that his wife and/or daughter were wig-wearing serial killers seems unlikely.  Yes perhaps she had a rough childhood, but so did the killers of Thomas Harris's work, and no renegade British agent was risking his life to save them.

Odd (but not terribly interesting) characters abound, from Ewwn McGregors' thoroughly American (don't ask me why) contact to a perhaps lesbian owner of a home for wayward girls and a blind mogul, the only one of whom draws any emotion from the audience.

Nothing in this movie makes much sense, and none of it is terribly interesting.  Don't bother watching it, let along buying it.

But, no, the movie was exactly THAT bad to provoke another negative response, at least from me. Who had the brilliant idea to film a thinly plotted espionage thriller as if it was a student art film? And artsy it certainly tries to be. The plot follows a neurotic British agent across the world as he becomes more and more enamored of a sociopathic, yet emotionally wounded, femme fatale on whom he has been spying. There is no rhyme or reason, even in the wide span of human desire and emotion, to explain many of the events and incidents that happen between the two or even why, other than sheer insanity, he is drawn to her in such a creepy stalker type fashion. The movie certainly won't tell you anything. It is too ""high brow"" for that and would rather show you fancy camera work and snow globe after snow globe. One gets the impression that the director is trying to impress you while completely forgetting that he is filming a trashy romantic spy novel (thus the scenes with a topless Mz. Judd would be defined as being ""tastefully done"" and ""necessary"" rather than tawdry and exploitative). You may sit around and discuss the nuamces of this ""film"" over a latte, but it doesn't erase the fact that it is simply dull and dumb, faulty advertising or no.
Oddly enough, there is an alternate ending on the DVD which, while not redeeming the film, at least ends it in a traditional Hollywood fashion and is a little more satisfying than what those in the theater saw. It is an additional scene where Ewan meets up, rather conveniently, with his long lost daughter. It is set up in the story that he has never seen his daughter before and has had to pick out which girl was his from a school photo of an entire class. He believed so strongly that the girl he chose was the right one that she appears throughout the film as a phantom of his imagination. It actually adds quite a bit of dimension and pathos to his character to find out in the ending that was cut, that he picked the wrong girl. I felt better about the viewing after watching this until I remembered that somebody decided to cut this scene for release, probably because it gave a little too much explanation and insight to a film that tried its hardest to offer absolutely none.
Even if the whole topless issue piqued your interest a few paragraphs back, trust me, it isn't worth it. Watching paint dry isn't the same thing as viewing a painting. That statement isn't as profound as it is nonsensical--like the whole concept of this film.",1086652800,13,2627,4.48643006263048

If the ending was done better I think this would have been a hit. If you like movies like ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"", ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" you should enjoy it. Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor are quite good in their roles.

This is not one I will watch as often as ""Along Came a Spider"" or ""Vertigo"", but I certainly added it to my collection of mystery/drama DVDs. Well worth at least a rental and if you like Judd you should seriously consider buying it.",1070236800,2,682,4.27906976744186
1204710,3,B00000F40X,"Let me start out by saying that despite the slow movement of the film, i really dug it. I wouldn't consider it a thriller so much as a psychological exploration into the minds of two deranged halves of the same coin. Ewan McGregor (the eye) has lost his daughter, his wife, and his mind is starting to slip (as noted by the fact that the only person he really truly talks to in most of the movie is the imaginary spectre of his daughter).Joanne (Ashley Judd) has lost her father, her innocence, and her mind is already long gone.
Both of them are victims of loneliness, socipathological tendencies, and pain that they never seem to show. Both of them are so ice cold throughout the movie - until something triggers them and you see just how much pain they must be in. And how much pain they are causing.
McGregor and Judd do great in this movie - although they do lack chemistry. This doesn't hinder the movie though since you almost never see them together. McGregor chases, stalks, hunts her around the world in her desperate flee from the police and herself. He grows to understand and accept her completley, as demonstrated by the way he predicts her moves towards the end.
The thing that really ruins this movie is just that - the ending. It's terrible. The whole movie builds up to this climax of them meeting and .... well it's disappointing to say the least. And confusing.
Now if someone could just get ahold of the script and the actors and make the ending CLIMATIC instead of ANTICLIMATIC. Have them kill eachother or themselves or something anything but the horrible thing they have patched in and called a conclusion.",1066608000,5,1630,4.585616438356165
1204711,1,B00000F40X,"I'm all for off-beat psychological thriller. The key word here is: thriller. Eye of the Beholder is psychological, but it is not thrilling.  A good thriller calls for good character development, something which this movie plainly ignores. And no, a one-minute flash-back by Judd in the middle of the movie is NOT good character development in my book.
Still the movies begins with much promise - a secret agent doing surveillance on a suspect is instead becomes a witness to his death by a smart, beautiful, and obviously dangerous woman. This is the classic shy/geeky guy meets hot/rebellious babe with a twist! But from there, the movie begins a downward spiral that even Trent Reznor never reached. Seriously, if the filmmakers want us, the audience, to feel sympathetic for a staller and a serial killer, they need to provide better reasons than one has his wife and daughter leave him and the other is abandoned by her father.
Without the emotional attachment that comes with good character development, the audience is reduced to mere spectators who watch two loonies doing things that don't make much sense for an audience who don't much care.  Furthermore, as good actors as McGregor and Judd are, they don't have chemistry.
And after sitting through this pile of manure, thinking there must be some sort of payoff at the end but it never came; I was left wondering: If his daughter really means more to him than anything in the world, why oh why doesn't the McGregor character invests all the time, money, and effort he uses to stall Judd; to find his daughter?",1054684800,12,1570,4.83271375464684

As close to perfection that I've seen in such a long time.  The musical score provides a brilliant ""manic"" back-drop.  The direction--simply superb.  You have to be a pretty lifeless person to not be drawn into the plot, a plot which thickens with every passing second.  The acting is superior, you really get a feel for the characters inner workings.  It's very easy to sympathesize with their perspectives.
Regardless of the emotional wreckage and devious mindset surrounding the leads, I found their portrayals most enjoyable.  All the while being drawn in, you want feel for them.  You simply will not relate to this film if you don't understand a life of serious downs--all the while trying to keep an optimistic eye.  It's the pleasures and wayward distractions that make life exciting after all.
Now the ending is a bit abrupt, and you find all emotions coming to a halt.  But that is part of the effect the movie leaves on you.  Making you want more, wanting more answers, wanting more emotional fullfillment--though yet you wouldn't want a single thing changed...
The critics and many average reviewers alike slam this movie with mass amounts of pesimistic negativity.  They obviously missed the point and really don't know how dreary life can be.",1030147200,3,1375,4.854077253218884

1204825,1,B00000F40X,"...it protrays a wicked serial killer but spends most of its time focusing on how someone might sympathize with her, not on either condemning her or objectively portraying the grisly nature of her crimes. There are no grounds of sympathy for her, but the movie seems to portray her as somehow understandably worthy of sympathy, by running by us the VAGUEST suggestions that something from her past ""made her what she is"". But leaving that something so vague just compounds the already gross impertinance of pointing to any ""reason"" why anyone should treat her sympathetically. She even seduces and kills a blind man, for heaven's sake! Secondly, when we look at good and worthy movie portrayals of mass murderers, we can be confident that the actor IS acting, for pete's sake. When Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter, that WAS acting, we all know that, don't we? He was above suspicion that he the actor was just acting out his ultimate fantasy. If a movie is to be made about a female serial killer of men, it might have a chance (with better writing than this!) to succeed similarly if cast in the killer role were some versatile actress like Jodie Foster or Laura Dern. Then we could know that it was acting. But take an actress who prides herself on a self-chosen nickname of ""ball-buster"" and cast her in that role, and it seems less like acting than playing out her fondest fantasy! That is what makes this so grisly and macabre. If such an actress is to play a killer at all, let's at least make it seem like acting by having her kill some women as well as men, or maybe having her hijack a plane with both men and women on board, or let her pressure-boil someone's pet rabbit. But this movie must be a sort of one-up-manship that intentionally blurs the distinction between performer and role. I've sometimes liked one-up-mansnip when it was comedy, but this is just sickening. We were badly in need of seeing Ashley Judd prove that she has a human soul above the haunting suspicion that her movie roles are a terrifying window into her psyche. I still hold out hope that she will do that. But this movie is reallly a downturn in any road to that happening, just when we least needed it.",1019088000,53,2199,4.597964376590331

Finally I broke down and watched it one night and honestly do not understand all the criticism.  I thought it was a fairly engrossing movie that kept me interested throughout the entire film.
To address a couple common complaints about the movie... A lot here say it was extremely confusing.  Although not a traditional plot for a movie, I didn't really see all that much to be confused about, it was fairly straightforward.  Most people seem to hate the movie for the ending alone.  While I agree its kind of an 'open' ending, its not that its necessarily bad.  There's basically 2 things that could possibly occur after the ending of the movie (I won't reveal them for spoiler sake).  Why is it so bad that the writer doesn't tell you which of the 2 things occurred?  Because it wasn't important to the story what happens afterwards, it was everything leading up to that point that was important.
While you are kind of thrown into the whole plot without much upfront explanation, Ewan's character is thrown into his feelings just as suddenly and that is when the story begins.  Throughout the film you piece together bits and pieces of each characters past to make you understand why they are doing the things they do and what led up to them.  Its basically a contrast of 2 people who have suffered great loss and how they cope with it.
I also found the camera effects to be very good as well as good acting through the film.
So if you need a movie where everything is tied up nice and neat at the end, this may not be for you, but other than that there really isn't too much to dislike about it.  Give it a try.",1000771200,4,1732,4.398119122257054

What he observes is the murder of the son by a beautiful woman for whom his shock quickly descends into an erratic obsessive love beyond the call of duty. The murderess, Johanna Eris (Ashley Judd) kills every man who yearns to get close having been deserted as a child by her father. Problematic to the story is the audience's realization that years before The Eye crossed the threshold from reality to fantasy loosing his daughter with whom he continues to converse, a ghostly reminder of his lonely existance.  Director Stephen Elliot (Pricilla, Queen of the Desert) earnestly tries to pull off this muddled murder-thriller.  Elliot wants to overwhelm his audience with the idea of love out of control and the haunted emotions of longing and loneliness, but he is unable to rise beyond the problematic script.  Judd is distant, an iceberg far from sexy, her acting is anything but compelling in the role of an older woman. Ewan McGregor, cast against type succeeds in bringing sympathetic pathos to his hunt with desperation and the need to find the daughter he's lost.  The surprising small cameos of Jason Priestley as a evil drug-head, and Genevieve Boujould are high points in the film. Nevertheless, the film is long on concept and short on follow through.

Ashley is actually Quite Good, she has a Sympathetic role which comes across well and allows her to show a lot of Emotion. In the end, it's Jason Priestly who Steals the Show.

1204966,3,B00000F40X,"The value of this movie is truly in the eye of the beholder; I suspect you have to want to like it to like it.  That said, I do think that it is a highly unusual and even enjoyable film that had some remarkably bad things happen to it:  for instance, the action/suspense oriented trailer that was UTTERLY misleading.  This film is a psychodrama, not a thriller.  As a result, the majority of audiences who watched it were bored to tears waiting for the action to start, as well as infinitely downed by the moody script and art direction.  Eye candy perhaps, but brain candy it ain't.
The main complaint I've heard is, ""It makes no sense.""  This is true, unfortunately; and I didn't realize until I read the book how much of the 'meat' of the story was cut out to make the movie film-friendly -- one thing that bothers me was that Ewan McGregor was chosen for a role that ought to have been played by a man a good 15-20 years older, whose long-lost daughter would actually have been in her early twenties.  Thus, the displaced fatherly emotions that the book centered around were warped into almost a love story in the movie, which I thought was a mistake.  It makes less sense, in a story where you need all of the plot points you can get.
Reasons to watch this film:  the beautifully hypnotic combination of the soundtrack and cinematography.  Gifted performances (often by incidental characters -- k.d. lang, Jason Priestly, Patrick Bergen, and Genevieve Bujold plug a surprising amount of life and color into the movie).  The remarkable way that the film, the characters, and the audience are forced in sympathy to gradually lose touch with reality.  And the sheer fun of watching the makeup, hairdressing, and costuming crew wreak havoc on Ashley Judd as she changes her identity in scene after scene.",977875200,10,1805,4.6415094339622645

However, those the only positive attributes to this mess of a movie.  It was an agonizing two hours of cinema. Yes, I did watch the whole film because I refuse to make judgements on only the first parts of a film.  Plus,  I was hoping that it would get a little more interesting.  Needless to say,  It didn't.  It crawled along at an excruciatingly slow pace from one city and event to the next. Also, I felt like there was no tension being built or maintained throughout.

I consider it to be among the best movies I saw this year. Of course, contrary to many thrillers, the movie is not focused on action only, but on psychology and feeling. It's a strange and touching love story between a woman murdered, and an investigator, who becomes her gardian angel. For once, it shows a serial killer as a human person, haunted by the past and able to evolve; and it shows an investigator able to identity with the person he haunts, and trying to save her. This movie is full of compassion and humanity. If you look for a classic dumb thriller, you will be disapointed. I you look for a very original love story, your curiosity will be fully rewarded. The actors are great. The scenario is very original. The realization itself carries many interesting touchs, such as the snow globes that Ewan Mc Gregor collects while following Asley Judd...

A British intelligence agent (Ewan  McGregor) assigned to a case, observes an attractive young woman brutally  killing a man.  He tails her.  Through conversations with his imaginary  daughter, he is directed to protect her as if she is a wayward ""little  girl"".  His headquarter's contact k d lang, concerned that he is in  left field (he is), continues to support him, so he does not lose contact,  but is flabbergasted with his current direction.
About the only thing I  found amazing in the movie, was his computer set up and how fast he could  move it.
Ewan McGregor, does some further research (amazing what DNA  typing can do in this movie) and finds out who she is.  A visit to a  prison, results in a contact with Genevieve Bujold, which gives a hint of  some promise that never materializes.
This movie continues on in this  direction for it's entirety, with the monotony of Ashley Judd's killing  spree contining, until she meets a wealthy blind man, who wants to marry  her. Ewan McGregor tries to warn him off, but instead eventually puts in  motion the car accident that kills him.
Further down the road, she  drifts to run into a violent Jason Priestley (a significant departure from  his 90210 days) who's entire role in this movie seems to be to get Ewan  McGregor to rescue Ashley Judd who runs away anyway.  Big surprise.
The  movies ends with Ashley Judd wondering who Ewan McGregor is, after running  away from him and getting injured in an auto crash. You are left unsure if  her character survives or not.  However, by that time, you don't care.",964569600,5,1824,4.615625

1205095,4,B00000F40X,"If ever a movie was put forth that concentrates on the extreme sense of loss and loneliness that a person can experience in life, it is the latest film by Stephan Elliot. ""Eye of the Beholder"" is a vibrant  package of gorgeous thrills that are as stunning as the lead actors'  preformances as well as the splendid cinematography. While the movie may be  confusing to some, and previews will surely mislead those in the mood for  action sequences, those of you in the market for suspense that keeps  mounting amidst an alluring backdrop shall be enthralled.  Ewan  McGregor (Trainspotting, The Pillow Book) stars as The Eye, an undercover  agent assigned to investigate the blackmail of a government official's son.  Upon tracking the suspect, he soon dicsovers that the blackmailer, a sexy  yet sinister woman, is really a serial killer with deep emotional  instability. As his surveillance continues, he begins to develop feelings  for her, and his connection with her costs him his loyalty to his work as  he works to keep her safe from the hands of the law. The pace builds with  intensity as he gets closer to her, but to reveal himself would mean losing  her forever.  The film, based upon the 1980 novel by Marc Behm, while  slandered by the highest of critics, is, in my opinion, a stunning visual  and emotional achievement that sweeps its audience into an involving and  tragic story of obsession, loss and loneliness. Says director Stephan  Elliott: ""I saw it as a story of two lost souls... that is what The  Eye and Joanna Eris share- a deep sense of loss.""  Those feelings  of loss are beautifully acted by Judd and McGregor, who play their parts  with a unique brand of mystery and intensity. As The Eye, McGregor's moods  change as swiftly as his location, shifting from stern and  involved-with-work to emotionally imbalanced as he thinks of his losses and  the woman he cannot hope to gain. Judd's Eris moves with catlike precision  throughout the film, gliding through the streets with just the right degree  of wariness and suspicion. It is evident from her portrayal that Judd is an  actress worthy of playing a woman constantly on the run.  Certain  filmmaking effects help to contribute to the intensity of certain moments  in the film. The scene on the street in New York City, in which Eris steps  out of her apartment and is told by her landlord that a strange man has  ""been following her around all week,"" is moved at a suspenseful  pace by close-ups of Eris, now required to keep her guard up, an  ear-pounding techno score by Marius de Vries, and close-ups of pedestrians  from her point-of-view. Another example of sound effects adding to the  quickening suspense is the scene on the sidewalk of Chicago, where Joanna  outsmarts The Eye and begins following him. The sound of this sequence is  devoid of all else except for the footsteps of these two characters,  creating a void in which they alone reside.  One reason for the film's  negative criticism was its ad campaigning. Theatrical trailers and  television commercials promoted the film to be a fast-paced action piece,  when in truth, it is a slow-building story with an very involving plot that  takes its time to unfold and reveal. Those looking for a movie that gives  its answers in the first fifteen minutes will be surely disappointed, but  those who look for involvement and creativity will be pleased with this  film, which is a wonderful achievement.",961545600,22,3448,4.820205479452055
1205096,1,B00000F40X,"The biggest mystery about this film is why on earth such a spectacular cast ever got involved with the project.  Throughout the video, I was intrigued by my confusion, and gave the film the benefit of the doubt; I  assumed that everything would tie together in the last few minutes, and I  might even want to rewind and rewatch it with this insight.  No such  luck.
I can honestly say that I have no real idea why everyone did what  they did at most points in the film.  So many issues were left hanging,  that I have to assume that important scenes were left on the cutting room  floor.
Ewan McGregor's character (""the Eye""), is a British  operative acting in the US through some joint (?) agency with unclear  jurisdiction.  He becomes obsessed with Ashley Judd's character after he  observes her murdering someone that he is surveilling.  Never really  figured out why, or why he interacts with her in the way that he does. And  this is in light of the fact that I was absolutely willing to suspend  belief, and go along with the fact that the Eye was watching surveillance  video on his laptop, through an internet line in a phone in a crowded plane  in Economy class. . .
The ending was odd.  I have no idea why it ended  that way, or what was going on.  So much of the story was left  hanging/unsaid, that I am purchasing the book on which it was based so I  can figure out what was happening.
Save your time and money; other than  some interesting performances, this film was one of the worst that I have  seen in a while.  (And will someone please have Ewan McGregor learn to  enunciate -- maybe I lost the point in the 10-20% I simply couldn't  understand.)",961372800,12,1666,4.3881578947368425

Imagine you lost your  wife and daughter cause you worked too hard as a secret service agent for  the British government.  Ok, that would mess you up etc...now imagine you  are following a woman as part of your job and she brutally stabs the man  you are following like 20 times, then she sits down and cries, ""Oh  Daddy"" - which somehow triggers in his mind that he left his daughter  and that his mind is telling him to ""not leave her alone"" because  in his mind that is what his daughter is telling him.
Ok, so you see this  chic stab someone brutally, then you decide to forget your duty and your  job, you witness this woman hack up another 4 guys, you kill another man  she is happy with, you shoot at cops to free her, she tries to kill you,  and all this time Ewan's character is just so smitten with her.  Bah!  This movie was garbage - totally unbelievable and lame...Ewan lets 4  innocent men die at her hands because he is smitten with her...this is a  secret service agent, you know those guys who have guts and minds of  steel....this movie sucked.
Other things that made this movie stupid were  unbelievable things like this:  He goes to visit her in the hospital, and  he asks for her, and the nurse says it is nice someone is visiting her, and  as he is going to walk to see her, the nurse says, ""You know she lost  the baby don't you?""

1205137,4,B00000F40X,"Unfortunately, this is one of those films that falls in the ""pick apart"" category for most people. Why ?  From other reviewers the feelings are mixed. It is a film where many viewers find themselves asking  if what Joanna's father did to her justifies her reason for committing the  crimes. Does such an excuse or reason hold water for the plot in this story?  What they fail to remember is some of the ""damage"" caused by her  other late life experiences which included her correctional mentor played  by Genevieve Bujold.
Personally, for me the feelings are somewhat mixed,  too, since I had previously seen Ashley Judd play a victim in Double  Jeopardy. In Eye, she is also a victim of circumstances that reads like a  laundry list ( from her father abandoning her, to a correctional system  where she fell through the cracks). She is literally a victim of  circumstances who shows us what happens when the end result is a trip down  a dark abyss of madness instead of one of hope and redemption(redemption  for her acts, not from the acts committed upon her by others). You often  see films where such dark characters somehow make ammends or climb out of  that abyss.
On the flipside, the Eye (Ewan McGregor) finds himself trying  to cleanse his conscience and soul of guilt for not being there for his  daughter. For the Eye, not in an incestuous or twisted sense, Joanna is  very reminiscent of that missing daughter and wife. One of the best lines  in the film is ,""I'm a daddy who has lost his little girl. You're a  little girl who has lost her daddy.""  The director or writer could  have easily written the typical background cliche where both daughter and  wife were killed due to one of his dangerous missions. Or, his daughter  could have been killed with wife surviving and leaving him with the blame.  It is haunting (no pun), yet captivating how the writer gave the viewer the  impression in the beginning that the Eye's daughter was dead. However, she  still is an actual ""ghost"" of his conscience and past. It is  through Joanna that he attempts to redeem himself; That is his obesession.  That is his weakness...
The only other film that comes to mind with  almost similar story lines is Basic Instinct. The only major difference is  there was nothing at all helpless or remotely redeemable about sharon  Stone's character; She simply killed men for the thrill of it !",960249600,6,2386,4.6610576923076925

Soon enough, he falls in love with  her and acts as her guardian angel.  This could have been a good movie, but  the story is poorly told, the actors other than Judd give very poor  performances, and the result is a boring movie that despite its twists and  turns is just about as exciting as watching paint dry.

Well, the movie's about a guy who works for some sort of British  Secret Service thingy  (it's never made clear what Agency it is, only that  the Agency is inordinately fond of teleconferencing, which, considering the  legions of clever hackers out there, is probably an unwise predilection).  The guy stumbles across a really hot serial killer . . . or is she?  I  mean, later in the film, we're encouraged to forget all those stabbings in  favor of developing a concern for her abused psyche.  Imagine Hannibal  Lecter dropped into  *The Prince of Tides*, and you'll get the  (preposterous)  idea.  Back to the Ewan McGregor character:  he wears a big  red parka and points a shotgun  (which is really a camera.  Why?)  out the  window at his lovely moll, in an clear effort to be inconspicuous.  Ashley  Judd, in the first half, at least has the pleasant diversions of playing  Dress-Up with designer clothes and fun wigs  (even though she's supposed to  be on the lam).  Unfortunately for her, though, she winds up as a waitress  in a coffee shop in . . . Alaska!  (Why?)
Along the way, the  screenwriters muck up the  ""Elektra complex""  and other suchlike  Freudianisms.

Albeit I commend him  for trying something new, this film just did not take off in the least. The  plot (if it even exists) is thin, there are so many incongruent events in  the film that it leaves viewers going, ""But--but--but!"" Folks,  just because a film is difficult to understand and peculiar does not grant  the right for people to call it a ""beautiful masterpiece."" When  you make a film that stars two big actors and promises a good story in the  trailer, you must deliver. You cannot assume that audiences will embrace an  offbeat story, unless, of course, you never claim it to be a satisfying  film. However, there are some good aspects about the film.
1.)  Cinematography: the angles and shots are sometimes beautiful. Interesting  way to shoot a film (if only there were a story to match it...).
2.)  Acting: Judd and McGregor are good actors who deliver in this film.  Obviously, they didn't let the lack of direction throw them. They somehow  made the parts work with what they had.
A good reason NOT to see the  film: McGregor's character (""The Eye"") has a young daughter with  whom he interacts quite a bit in the film, and after a while viewers  realize that she is but a figment of his imagination. His real daughter is  lost somewhere in the world because his wife took her. Anyway, could they  have hired a more exasperating young actress?
