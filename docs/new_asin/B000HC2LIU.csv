2632647,5,B000HC2LIU,Like to watch movies with Doris Roberts Great movie.  If you own them you can watch them when ever you want.  Don't have to wait on TV.  Most of the time I've already seen before I buy so I no I like it.,1307232000,2,203,3.6744186046511627

2632649,5,B000HC2LIU,"This is a great movie.  I am a fan of Doris Roberts.  She plays the role of an aging woman losing her memory due to Alzhiemer.  Will her family come to her aid in her time of need?  Buy it you'll enjoy it.
I also hope they will reprint the movie with Doris Roberts ""our House""  I'd love to have it among my collection.",1280793600,3,318,3.90625
2632650,5,B000HC2LIU,"This is a beautiful movie, done with great sensitivity.  Doris Roberts as the mother with Alzheimer's is superb, she shows the pain and difficulty of coming to terms with such an illness.  The daughters played by Megan Gallagher and Dana Delaney show us how this disease effects the immediate family - it is all very well done, I've been there myself so I know the movie and cast portrayals ring True.  For added enjoyment Louise Fletcher plays Aunt Billy - the relative taking care of Maggie (Doris Character) This movie is worth watching and a good addition to any video library.",1280275200,3,581,4.732673267326732
2632651,5,B000HC2LIU,"A wonderful book, not only for those whose family involve a member with loss of memory but also for all of us.  There were several eye opening messages in the movie that could be applied to not only their family situation, but others as well.  It did bring tears to my eyes at times but they were healing tears for me.  It is a beautiful story of a family that let love get them thru the tough time they were facing.  A love that helped heal some of the hurts in the past.  We can learn some life lessons from this movie, besides enjoying a beautiful movie.",1263686400,4,557,4.168224299065421
2632652,5,B000HC2LIU,"This is a wonderful movie to watch. It makes you reflect on your family members that have undergone memory loss, but also to ask yourself if I go through this process when I get older who will be there for me. I shall treasure this movie in my collection and watch it again often.",1246320000,12,280,4.203703703703703
2632653,5,B000HC2LIU,"This movie premiered on the Lifetime channel in November a few years back. A friend told me about it, and sugested I watch it with my sister. It was a bonding time for us as our Mother was suffering with Alzheimer disease. Doris Roberts did an oustanding performence as a Mother of two daughters who had this terrible and heartwrenching disease. We not only cried  a LOT, but became very educated and helped us deal our own Mom. If you have a loved one who has Alzheimer, this will help you understand and perhaps cope with what to expect as this disease progresses. Thanks to Doris Roberts and a great cast, I was fortunate to see this film.",1244332800,13,642,4.440677966101695
2632654,5,B000HC2LIU,"You will find this to be a very sensitive, and realistic, treatment of the problem of Alzheimer's. It is such a welcome change for Doris Roberts, who is usually associated with comedy. She is a consummate actress, as is Dana Delany (China Beach). This is not a downbeat story, but rather an affirmation of the power of love. Highly recommended.",1186185600,24,344,4.75
2632665,5,B000HC2LIU,This is a very touching movie - a tear jerker but you will love how real this movie seems.,1407801600,,90,3.789473684210526

2632667,5,B000HC2LIU,"Hey, I like her.  This isn't a great movie but it is good and if you like Dana, well, go for it.",1394236800,,96,3.3636363636363638
2632668,4,B000HC2LIU,"This movie was not as I would have expected. Doris Roberts was good in her portrayal of onset of Alzheimer's, but the movie did not hold my interest.  Of course, there is nothing lighthearted about a story of dealing with this disease, and the effect it can have on family. There was too much negativity, and lack of understanding how to cope  and have compassion, (for their mother) within the family.  ""I have seen better movies on the subject, but the acting was good.""",1392681600,2,472,4.595238095238095

2632671,5,B000HC2LIU,This movie had a very touching theme.  They actors were terrific and it was a beautiful story without any uncomfortable content or  swearing.  It gently reveals how fast life moves on and how we should cherish every day with loved ones.,1361923200,,236,4.7073170731707314

2632674,5,B000HC2LIU,"I love this film! Dana Delany, Doris Roberts, Megan Gallagher and Louise Fletcher are all brilliant! There are many complex relationships going on here apart from the main mother/daughter one. This was a real saddy film that delved into the relationships between mothers and daughters, sisters, and  caregivers. Beautifully acted. I think it was more about the acceptance of each other rather than the focus on Alzheimer's and dementia. The relationship between Britt and her mother was touching and extremely well played by Dana and Doris, it was so real, that it came very close to home for me and I am sure many others. I also loved the baby so freaken cute!! And I loved the art space that Britt had going on, and her paintings were interesting. I highly recommend this film. 2 box of man size tissues! Ammiright!!",1321833600,3,818,4.801418439716312

8138044,5,B000HC2LIU,This is a wonderful story about a mother and daughter separated by a little stubbornness on both sides. They are slowly reunited during the Thanksgiving holiday quite by accident. I absolutely love the story. It is a bit warm and fuzzy but it bring to light a lot about facing problems with our elderly family members. A story to be told again and again.,1428537600,,354,4.546875
