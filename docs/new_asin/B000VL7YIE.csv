8219290,2,B000VL7YIE,"Except for a routine or two, all routines shown are for the Arkansas ladies team.  The item description should note this so someone (like me) would know this DVD does not cover the teams who reached the regionals!",1228694400,,213,4.605263157894737
8219291,3,B000VL7YIE,"This item should have been titled ""Lady Razorbacks in 2006 regionals"".  Although the gymnastics was very good, this video focused solely on the 2006 Arkansas women's team at their regional finals with the exception of 1 beam routine by UCLA Bruin(and former Canadian national member) Kate Richardson.  This video has nice well-educated gymnastics commentary provided by the Gymbacks staff who produced it.  I was hoping to see other teams perform, especially UCLA and Florida.  Also, the final team standings printed on the back of the box don't match what is shown on the video.",1190592000,,579,5.127659574468085
