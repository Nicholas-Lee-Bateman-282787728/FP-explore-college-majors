That was said so many times at the frat it was very welcome. There are many extras worth anything you need o topaz for it It is presented in full 16x9 screen viewing so it is very well presented.",1398384000,,346,3.9571428571428573
4483336,5,B004VLZUDG,Animal House is one of the best comedic movies.  I wish movies like this could be made today.  I love this movie.,1396310400,,113,4.090909090909091

4483339,5,B004VLZUDG,"This has always been one of my all-time favorite movies...classically funny (and on-point! lol!)  But this DVD exceeded my expectations with the extra ""BONUS"" tracks that were included!  I would highly recommend this to any fellow ""Animal House"" fans out there!!!",1393286400,3,263,5.390243902439025
4483340,5,B004VLZUDG,"This is a great movie with some classic humor and great fun. And of course John Belushi if you under 30 ask your parents or google his name. He much like Chris Farley passed before his time due to tragic circumstances and this movie is one of his best. He starts the classic food fight scene and the scene where he destroys the guitar at the toga party. You should buy this just because Belushi is in it.

I can confirm as of Feb. 2014 the digital copy code works on iTunes unlike some other blu ray digital offerings",1391558400,4,517,4.222222222222222

8443578,5,B004VLZUDG,"What's not to like about this film?  It's like Blazing Saddles in breaking all the molds and traditions of film making.  WAY ahead of its time in the comedy world and one of the funniest flicks ever.  Belushi has never been better in any role, TV or movie....Jake Elwood a very close second.",1406764800,2,291,4.452830188679245
