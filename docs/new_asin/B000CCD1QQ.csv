2456323,3,B000CCD1QQ,"This is a chick flick disguised as a National Lampoon movie, or vice versa.

It does have a gross fraternity building with a couch outside, full of dirty garbage, inside and out, with a gross roommate with a blow up doll, and it does take place in a college.  But besides that, it is a chick flick.  Adam starts dating Eve, who's a virgin, and it's all about him realizing that he loves her even though all they're doing sexually is making out.  And it's about Adam coming to terms with his feelings, and about Eve coming to terms with her fears. Blech.

I could have sworn this was written by a woman, but it turns out Adam and Eve has a male writer.  I guess guys can write chick flicks, too.  This movie was just okay for me, but I'm sure your girlfriend will love it.",1269820800,2,771,4.204081632653061
2456324,1,B000CCD1QQ,"Most will watch this film to see virginity lost--after all, it is a National Lampoon title. A few may watch it to see how to keep their virginity until they marry, or perhaps die. Some like me will stumble upon it on late night cable, and find it a nearly perfect cure for insomnia. How could I know any one film could be so bad? In a spirit of genuine concern, I formally warn you.

No plot, no acting, no skin, no comedy, no action. This is not even useful for a Sunday school class on virginity. It is an atrocity and a zero. Rent Animal House or Vacation if you want real National Lampoon material, or anything else you please; just avoid this soap opera.",1169251200,3,659,4.23015873015873
2456325,1,B000CCD1QQ,"NATIONAL LAMPOON has come out with some great party movies.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The premise is pretty straightforward:  a girl in college does not want to go ""all the way"" with her b/f because she wants everything to be special.  That's fair enough and is also understandable.

IF the movie would have only focused on that and nothing else (and I can live with it being over an hour shorter), then it would have been OK.  The reason?  Easy.  Emmanuelle Chriqui is absolutely STUNNING as Eve.  Her beauty fills of the screen;  I'd love to see more of her work and hope that she gets better roles in much better movies than this farce.

Unfortunately, too much of the movie is about the subplot of living @ a fraternity house.  To be sure, this is a very common motif in NATIONAL LAMPOON movies.  The problem is, the fellow frat-boys of Adam are beyond disgusting.  Moreover, the movie wants to ""push the envelope"" of being nasty, relying on shock-value more than doing something because it has any humor value.

Cameron Douglas is a goon;  I was a bit surprised to learn that he was the son of Michael Douglas.  He certainly does not have any acting ability whatsoever, unlike his father & grandfather.  Apparently in this film he is a sort of Ron Jeremy anti-hero type;  the dufus guy who ends up with the sizzling hot babe.

This is the bottom line, and I will be as fair as I can be:  if you crave bathroom humor and simply can't get enough of it, then by all means buy this DVD.  If bathroom humor is your ""thing,"" then this DVD is a dream-come-true.

However, if like me a little bit of that stuff goes a LONG way, then check out other, better NATIONAL LAMPOON movies such as BARELY LEGAL and VAN WILDER.  The choice is your's.",1145059200,12,1753,4.423197492163009
2456326,2,B000CCD1QQ,"This movie is sometimes a comedy but mostly it deals with a real relationship and the problems that come into it when Eve wants to stay a virgin.  Little bits are thrown in for comedic value and they center around Adam's roomates in college who are all disgusting (I would reccommend not eating while watching these parts, it could ruin your meal).  Overall, everyone will see Eve as a total beyotch because she is being totally unfair in the relationship while Adam is a totaly douche. I would not reccommend this movie for it's comedic value, but maybe as an afterschool special? Ha",1143676800,3,584,4.660194174757281
2456327,1,B000CCD1QQ,"Look.  We rented this ""film"" because we thought the premise had merit.  Finally, something outside the Bud-beer-comercial sameness everything in our culture pushes.  Bravo to the film on that.  Bravo!  It DID tackle the subject with seriousness. At no time did it stray from that intention.  OK.  Good for you.

GAWD was this BORING!  GAWD was this amaturish!  Dear Lord in Heaven, please help kids who want to spend a few weekends slapping together a ""film"" (entirely shot on videotape) with the dialogue, with the plot (so it's not so predictable), with the CAMERAWORK that doesn't look like Uncle Dave got ahold of his camcorder.  What's with all the smoke in the rooms?  Too much!

A good student film.

National Lampoon will put their name in front of anything now.

Ladies and Gentlemen... like the main character dude in the film, when renting or buying ""films"", check anything before you take it out for the night... make sure you're clear if it's going to give you a urinary tract infection... or if it's still figuring out how to do this whole filmmaking thing for the first time.  I want a new rating.  ""A"" for amature.",1142467200,2,1130,4.712820512820513
2456328,4,B000CCD1QQ,"Adam and Eve proved that ""guy"" humor at its funniest, is best served raunchy. I thought Adam's character was believable and well acted, although I doubt Cameron Douglas has had much experience with ""blue balls."" Eve's character was beautiful, intelligent and evoked my respect. The actress has a great ass and great assets as an actress. I thought the script was sincere, very funny and relevant. Adam and Eve treats a woman's ""right to choose"" to be a virgin in college (oh my God, imagine that!) with respect and a raunchy dose of humor.",1141948800,6,539,4.74468085106383
2456329,4,B000CCD1QQ,"The output from National Lampoon the past couple of years has been unmitigated crap.  See, for example, National Lampoon's Dorm Daze...no, actually, don't.  But this movie was pretty damn good.  First off, Emanuelle Chirqui is my new ""it"" girl.  She is so beautiful, I'm in love.  Looking at her beautiful face and body is itself worth the couple bucks to rent this movie.  But there's more!  The story is interesting and there are lots of funny lines and situations.  To put it in perspective, I'd say this movie is not quite as good as American Pie, but it is better than Van Wilder and Dude, Where's My Car? among others.  Rent it!  You will not be disappointed.",1139961600,5,665,4.6068376068376065
2456330,2,B000CCD1QQ,"On one hand, I give the movie credit where other movies have been unrealistic and phony, ADAM & EVE had the guts to make something very real. At times, TOO REAL. At times, unnecessarily TOO REAL.

They just had to slip in the gross out jokes to please all the immature goofballs out there. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there is a time and a place for gross out jokes, pubes in the shower etc., but they're less funny then something that takes execution and timing. Not to mention, they alienate the audience. The people that find that thing disgusting, are put off, and won't return.

Okay... back to the movie. ADAM & EVE is about love and sex. It's about a young HOT college girl, EVE (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and a typical college guy, ADAM (Cameron Douglas). They meet, find each other interesting, Adam tries to score and then Eve tells him that she's a virgin, and is being patient with her standing.

Then, as I said before, the movie is very real. All the things that come into play: the ridiculing friends, the things you do when your girlfriend looks like Emmanuelle Chriqui and you're being made to wait, the criticisms, the other girl that ISN'T holding out, etc. etc.

Although, I question one thing. Why in the world would a girl looking like Emmanuelle Chriqui be interested in this guy? She seemed like a nice girl. Smart. Nice room. Nice, wholesome girl. Yet, Adam is a partying bum. Lazy. Lives in a pig-sty. His yard looks like a trash dump and he goes and lays in his bed all day. His friends are the epitome of bums and womanizers... but then... I thought about it, and realized... actually, when I was in college, yeah... that was about right. Women liked these type guys.

Although, I do give the movie credit for being real, there wasn't enough going on. There weren't enough side plots and not enough to keep the movies pace going. When the movie deviated from the MAIN plot, it just went and told gross out stories with Adam's loser friends, or showed little side stories that never really explained themselves.

Ultimately, the only good thing I can say about ADAM & EVE is that it was realistic. Otherwise, the movie was less than average, and pretty forgettable.",1139616000,8,2187,4.566326530612245

8097089,5,B000CCD1QQ,"I loved this movie, way better then any one video in the American Pie series.  The reason I loved this movie, was because it was everyday CA-wierd believable.  Being from CA I highly related to everything in here.  The acting was great.  The gags were funny.  Loved everything from the STD close calls, to the puberty hair war, to the debate on how to properly wipe.  The thing that most of these other reviewers are failing to realize, is THEESSEE are the types of things guys ACTUALLY talk about when we are in the company of our most trusted council.

This movie was so realistic to the college experience.  I felt like I was actually there.  Favorite scene, when the chick drinks the cup of NOT BEER and asks ""is this is a Pale Ale"".",1290988800,,737,4.4
