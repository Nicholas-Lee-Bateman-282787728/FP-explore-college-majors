7967814,5,B00006FDBL,"This superb documentary that renders significant events in the life of Leon Trotsky is based largely upon the initial chapter of the final volume: ""THE PROPHET OUTCAST"", from Isaac Deutscher's impressive biographical trilogy of Trotsky's life, a work that should be known to all earnest students of 20th century Russian history.  The film is a well-prepared composite of dramatic action and historic visual data that utilizes an abundant gathering of material as a means of depicting authenticity from within the tumultuous life of Trotsky during his final years as an exile from Russia.  For the dramatised portions, Trotsky is played by veteran Soviet actor Victor Sergachev, whose close facial resemblance to the exiled Communist leader when in his fifties gives special emphasis to those episodes.  Trotsky's second wife, Natalya, is performed by Turkish actress Isik Yenersu in a primarily non-speaking role.  The film is narrated by long-time Trotsky acolyte Vanessa Redgrave, whose political activism increases the value of her contribution, cogently written by the Turkish director, journalist Turan Yavuz.  The dramatised dialogue paraphrases Trotsky's written output while in his third exile period (during the others he was forcibly sequestered in Siberia).  Spoken languages of the dramatisation segments are Russian, French and Turkish, with accurately rendered subtitles into English, for a film that benefits from the authoritative direction of Yavuz.  Action opens in 1929 as Trotsky and Natalya, aboard a U.S.S.R. vessel, ""Ilyich"", are being banished from Odessa to Constantinople (renamed Istanbul the following year).  There they resided without benefit of a visa until 1933, initially within the Russian Consulate and, soon after, on the island of Prinkipo (B&uuml;y&uuml;kada in Turkish), only 12 miles from Constantinople, in the Sea of Marmara, upon which the controversial progressive Soviet leader decided to remain until he might obtain a visa for entering any of several Western European nations, an aspiration that was not achieved for several years.  Kemal Atat&uuml;rk's new government system altered Turkey at this time, politically, socially and culturally.  Trotsky's circumstances, in particular his safety, were dependent upon this iconoclastic leader of the newly minted republic.  Atat&uuml;rk fortunately provided the exile and his wife with substantial personal protection while yet maintaining amicable relations with a Stalin-led Russia.  During all of this while, Trotsky's visa applications to permit his entrance into Germany, Italy, Spain, France, et alia, were unfailingly rejected, disappointing and angering him, although each of these various countries accurately adduced his potential threat to their internal stability.  Despite being taxed by harsh family difficulties, including the suicide of his emotionally fragile daughter Zinaida in Berlin, Trotsky is depicted expressing great concern over the successful establishment of National Socialism in Germany, and also Stalin's increasing strength.  An unflagging writer, Trotsky completed during this time his magnificent history of the Russian Revolution.  Additionally, Trotsky's appreciation for the natural beauty found on Prinkipo and the island's silence (motor vehicles have never been permitted, except for service vehicles) are emphasized as is his love of fishing (the swashing of water in contact with a small boat is aural backdrop for both opening and closing credits of the piece), but it is the seldom-seen film clips and photographs that compromise the most persuasive distinction of the work.  Among these are quite rare clips and photos of Trotsky, Atat&uuml;rk and Stalin; documents relative to Trotsky's years in Turkey; and, historically significant reproductions from Turkish news journals that describe the convulsing effect that the famed exile had upon a nation that had adopted a political system far different from that of the Soviet Union, notably upon nearly 100,000 ""White"" Russians, exiles themselves, whose intransigent partisan beliefs did not create a welcome environment for Trotsky, who liked Turkey and the Turkish people. However, as he did not speak the language and, as his actor surrogate quotes him, he is too old for learning a new tongue.  Consequently, when he was finally able to obtain a visa (into France), he swiftly packed and left B&uuml;y&uuml;kada.  This generally well-detailed film glosses over his last years with its downbeat ending in Mexico, permitting a viewer to instead mull over the greatest portion of this capably constructed and partly dramatised documentary that enjoys particularly strong production characteristics.",1270857600,4,4687,5.729106628242075

7967816,5,B00006FDBL,"""Exile in Buyukada"" offers a multitude of stories tied to a single event: the 1929-1934 exile in Turkey by Leon Trotsky following his expulsion from the Soviet Union after his losing power struggle with Stalin. The film offers not only a personal history of Trotsky's unusual exile, but also a rich history of the development of the modern secular state in Turkey, the rise of communism and fascism in 1930s Europe, the chilling global reach of Stalin's police apparatus and the cult of celebrity in the pre-digital era.
Trotsky originally had no desire to spend his exile in Turkey. He did not speak the language, had no affinity for the culture, and was singularly opposed to the anti-communist focus of Kemal Ataturk, who was trying to kickstart the once-backward Islamic nation into the midst of the 20th century. Nor was Turkey originally pleased to have Trotsky. Not only did his presence bring a sudden wave of secret agents and would-be assassins, but there was also a large population of exiled White Russians who were eager to see Trotsky killed and there was also the nascent Turkish Communist Party that was eager to find new political strength.
Trotsky originally settled in the Soviet Consulate in Istanbul, which was a curious choice of location considering there was the genuine risk of his being killed by Stalin's henchmen. He then briefly settled in a swank Istanbul hotel and then retreated to Buyukada, an exclusive island 12 miles off the Istanbul coast. On Buyukada, Trotsky devoted himself to creating an extraordinary torrent of essays and books while planning the spread of global communism with a parade of international visitors.
""Exile in Buyukada"" is rich with a wealth of rarely-seen newsreel footage, photographs and newspaper clippings showing Trotsky's years in Turkey. Ironically, Trotsky never comprehended what an incongruous figure he was in this time and place: as a political figure who preached the worker's revolution in a country which underwent its own profound socio-economic revolution which not only stood in stark contrast to the rest of Europe, but was also completely at odds with the rest of the Islamic world. (Watching this film, one wishes countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran could have their own version of Ataturk.) Trotsky, however, did enjoy a high level of celebrity status and was frequently interviewed by the Turkish media and by visiting reporters who sought him out. He also penned his own newspaper commentaries that received international publication (including regular bylined features in the New York Times), and for someone espousing Marxist rhetoric, he had an unusually strong interest in collecting royalties from his many publishers.
""Exile in Buyukada"" is the rare political documentary which offers a balanced picture even when the subject at hand is clearly not worthy of respect. While Trotsky still exerted great influence as a political scientist, he was impotent in offering a genuine opposition to Stalinism and he was clearly a toothless force in preventing the rise of fascism in Germany. Even within his Turkish base of operations, Trotsky was ultimately check-mated by Stalin who abruptly courted and won an alliance with the Turkish government in 1932 after years of studied indifference between Moscow and Ankara. Trotsky's politics also took an acute priority over his family life, resulting in strained relations with his children and even driving one of his daughters (who could not break down her father's aloofness and perceived hostility) into severe depression and suicide. By the time he left Turkey for periods in France, Norway and Mexico, his authority on the world stage was minimalized and his influence within the Soviet Union was nil.
""Exile in Buyukada"" takes the unusual step of presenting detailed and lengthy recreations of Trotsky's activities during this period. These are clearly required since only a limited amount of movie and photographic imagery of Trotsky exists. But while most dramatic recreations of historic events are frequently cheesy endeavors, they work stunningly in this film thanks to a magnificent production design that faithfully recreates Turkey of yesteryear and a marvelous performance by Russian actor Victor Sergachev as Trotsky, who beautifully underplays his role and thus provides a rich human dimension to the passionate and frequently overbearing revolutionary. The film is also blessed with a crisp narration by Vanessa Redgrave which offers an intelligent running commentary to the amazing events being presented.",1059091200,21,4554,5.291436464088398
