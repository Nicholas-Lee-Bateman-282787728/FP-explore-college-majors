Gustave Kervern is an equally wonderful actor and the two leads have great chemistry, playing very well off each other's energy. The film is an understated roller coaster of emotions: curious, funny, yet tragic, and probably one of my favourites of Deneuve's newer films (Also watch: Elle s'en va, Indochine, A Christmas Tale, Potiche, 8 Femmes, L'Homme qu'on aimait trop [In the Name of My Daughter]). She's beautiful now, as she was in her earlier films, but the maturity in her work makes her far more than a beautiful actress on the screen; her films have such depth. Highly recommend this film!",1512345600,,764,4.7518796992481205
8662466,3,B00KX9JJIC,"I found this to be a painfully narrow generational study, depressing, in fact, and unlikely to be understood or appreciated by viewers below the age of 65 or enjoyed by those 65 and above.  I feel this film, like its two principal characters, desperately lacks comic relief along with some children and productive families among its cast; but that very lack is an essential part of this naturalist drama.  We viewed this film at the Mary D. Fischer Theater in Sedona, and as is generally the case, there were few, if any, in the audience below the age of 65.
The principal character is played by Gustave Kervern, and the opening scene seems to portend comedy.  A guitarist performer of some success, Gustave is dejected, alone in his dressing room, while an organized pleads he return to the stage, Ive covered for you through 6 curtain calls.  Youve got to get out there! The camera then follows Gustaves typical airline suitcase as it rolls across the limelit stage, never to return.
Gustave is off to an employment agency, desperate.  His life is adrift.  He needs daily structure, something material to work at, something he can look at and touch when each day ends, something that might integrate him into some close society and perhaps reawaken childhood longings.  He feigns experience in building maintenance and, thanks to the distraught and aging mind of Catherine Deneuve, signs on as maintenance man for her past-its-prime apartment building occupied by headed-nowhere residents all adrift within their own psychologic oblivion.
Gustave is unable to sleep nights.  He suffers a host of petty dysfunctions (intestinal, etc.) and immediately confronts one of humanitys greatest sources of vexation:  the task of managing other people.  With no support staff, he alone is responsible for enforcing HOA regulations, overseeing building storage space, quelling inter-residential disputes, and dealing with a psycho cult-group member and his dogs (this societys only young characters).  Among all these unstable characters  seemingly all in immediate need of Frances liberal vacation laws  Catherine serves as Gustaves surrogate daughter or aunt in need of support.  She is the one person he can try to help.  Off-setting this positive character is another helpless resident who provides Gustave with cocaine (The film needs comic relief, and this isn't a step in that direction.)  Gustaves one semi-comic act, and his greatest lasting achievement, is his uprooting of tall climbing roses from a neglected park and his laborious landscaping of the run-down buildings courtyard.
Were this film an assignment for Literary Analysis 101 back in my Freshman days, at least some student would surely have declared Gustave a Christ figure, in that he abandons his guitar and all worldly goods, past friends and family to devote his final days to others.  His intentions are good, and, so it appears, his final act succeeds in saving Catherine  though this salvation is a bit vague, maybe more like a miracle.",1428624000,,3007,5.152263374485597
