I decided to purchase this DVD ( Samba Reggae) after I purchased Quenias first DVD ( Samba from Rio De Janeiro) and I gotta say really enjoyed this DVD. I am a dancer and personal trainer and I believe this has to be one of the the most thorough workouts on a DVD that I have experienced . There is a good warmup before the routine ( something that a lot of my excercise and dance DVD's lack) and then there are 2 versions of the same choreography ( the slower instructional section and the full throttle routine). It's best to do the 2 routines back to back. There is live drumming by 5 drummers in the DVD and the instructor is accompanied by 2 dancers. Their enthusiasm and energy is contagious. Having been to Salvador Bahia Brasil I can also tell you that the music and dance is both creative and authentic  ... Good job !!! and 2 thumbs up for this one

2877497,5,B000RZP472,"I have to say right at the top that this is a great dance workout.  It is energetic; the music is hot and you will sweat.  You can see a clip of the dvd at the worlddancenewyork web site. What you can expect:

Setting:  Quenia and 2 dancers with 5 drummers behind her.  She has to talk quite loudly because the drummers are right behind her and any one who has been in a live drumming samba class knows that the drums are pretty loud. The video quality is good.  The sound could have been louder.  I had to turn my tv up quite loud to get the pounding beat of samba reggae.

Choreography:  There is a really nice warm-up before the workouts. In workout 1, she goes over each step many times and does add on and goes from the top.  The 1st workout goes over the entire routine once at the end; however by that time you have gone over the routine many many times from the top.  I was sweating and had to stop and drink some water.
Workout 2 is just the choreography at a much faster pace with no instruction.  She does it 2x through.  The last section of the dvd is the bateria playing as it would do in a real class where the students dance in front of the bateria.  By that time I was so tired all I could do was wiggle from side to side.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice if the 2 background dancers had started free style dancing, like in a regular class.  There is no cool down.

One caveat, don't skip the welcome section.  It starts with the bateria and then Quenia dances on stage doing part of the choreography and free style.  In my opinion, this litte section should have been at the end of dvd when the bateria is playing.  So if you have the energy, after the bateria section, you may want to play part of the welcome section again and dance with Quenia.

Overall:  I loved, loved this dvd.  Will do it again!  It is a great aerobic workout.  Will probably add a cool down next time.  Get this dvd.  You will love it!",1191283200,103,1945,4.117333333333334

I was able to memorize the choreography after doing workout 1 once. Workout 2 is the intense short version of the entire sequence that packs full-blast cardio in only 7 minutes. If you love Zumba and workouts from the Dance and Be Fit series, this is an excellent addition to your workout video library, which will certainly add fun and variety to your fitness routine.

2877515,2,B000RZP472,"I loved this workout the very first time I tried it. I liked it the second time. I thought it was ""eh"" third time. The 4th time? I started getting bored with it. By the 5th try, I didn't want to do it anymore. And I will explain why. It is not because Quenia Ribeiro is not a good teacher. She is an excellent dance teacher and I loved  the drummers and the back up dancers at first too. What I don't like about this dvd is the monotonious of the dance moves. Ms. Ribeiro breaks down the steps, shows the first steps in slow tempo, then fast tempo a few times then she moves on to the next steps, does the same, then goes back from the top, shows the 1st and 2nd steps a few times before moving on to the third move, does this a few times , then goes back to the top, puts it all together, then teaches the 4th move, then goes back to the top, puts it all together, does this a few times, before moving on to the next move, then it starts all over again, and you get the picture.  After a while, I got sick of having do the same dance moves over and over again before I learn the next move. And when you put it all together... the whole choreography is not even 3 minutes long. So imagine having to do 2 minutes and 49 seconds worth of choreography in 30 minutes or longer?  It really does get boring. And when the dance got boring, the drum beats became monotonous,  then you start losing interest in what you're doing. And once I've mastered and memorized all the dance steps (not that hard since it's less than 3 minutes worth once you put it all together), It's no fun doing the work out from the beginning anymore. This might be good in a live class setting, but for a dvd? It's a flop. Even if she had moved on a little faster with much less repetitiveness and added a bunch more moves to the choreography, the beauty of having it on dvd, is that we can play it over and over again until we learn it. For example, the great thing about Zumba or Rockin' Body or Hip Hop Abs, is that they teach so many dance moves and they break down the choreography in short segments of 3 minutes each (give or take), which makes it fun and more motivating to do and I for one, prefer a 45 minute work out doing many different dance moves and not just the same steps  over and over again as if i was learning it for the first time.",1407283200,,2321,4.047930283224401
2877516,5,B000RZP472,"I love love this video, the music is fantastiv (if your looking for an African flair with strong drums). I have always wanted to take an African dance class and this satisfies that yearning I had. Quenia shows all the dance moves first and once you catch the routine the fun and sweating begins. I am looking forward to the results. Love it",1405555200,,340,4.412698412698413
2877517,1,B000RZP472,"I do not care for this workout video.  If you already have a background I. This type of dance, I'm sure you would probably like it.  My feeling is that she adds way too many different steps to the routine and then incorporates them too quickly.  I just ran in place most of the time the video ran.  Also, the drums were the same throughout the whole 40-some minutes, very monotonous!  No, I would not recommend this to someone who isn't already a samba dancer.",1399939200,,460,4.364705882352941

2877521,5,B000RZP472,The moves are easy enough to understand because she breaks it down. Makes you really feel like you're a Brazilian dancer at Carnival!,1391817600,,133,4.826086956521739

2877523,5,B000RZP472,I was looking for a routine that would allow me to get my cardio up without feeling like I was actually working out.  Love this girl.  The DVD has very practical steps that you've done before but she moves very fast...so keep up.  Its a sexy and fun regimen.  Going to buy more of her instructionals once I've mastered this one.,1385856000,,328,4.327868852459017
2877524,5,B000RZP472,"I love to dance and I wanted a workout that was similar to my style of dancing and was something that I could relate to. Quenia does not disappoint! The rhythms are strong, the movements feel very natural, and it is a good time. If you really go through the routine, you will be drenched. I would say that you will need to have some skill in dancing in order to enjoy this video. There is quite a bit of hip rolling, shoulder rolling, and feet coordination required in order to appreciate this video.",1379548800,,500,4.329787234042553

2877526,5,B000RZP472,"Very well done!  The steps are very well explained and relatively easy to follow, specially for me who had never taken anything like this before.  The first time I was only able to do 45 minutes and had to stop because I was out of breath.  The second time was better and by the third time, I had already memorized the steps.  Fabulous exercise!",1379462400,,345,4.34375
2877527,2,B000RZP472,It becomes pretty boring with all the jumping. and I had a hard time understanding her. I believe it was too advanced for my level of fitness. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT,1377216000,,186,4.054054054054054
2877528,5,B000RZP472,"This is definitely a fat burner, the instructor moves a little quick but it's not at all hard to follow i used it once and felt like i had been at the gym for three hours wow. This is worth the money and it came in perfect condition and really quickly. I will continue to use this dvd it was a great buy.",1369440000,,304,3.8412698412698414
2877529,5,B000RZP472,I just love this DVD and so to will you. If you love to watch the show Dancing With The Stars you just have to get this DVD. Once you start you just won't want to stop and in no time you to will be dancing like the stars do on TV. Highly recommended.,1366934400,,250,3.6481481481481484

2877531,3,B000RZP472,"The moves are good, she does a great job explaining and demonstrating them, however the entire 45 minute workout consists of her demonstration of one set of moves that when put together only takes you about 3.5 minutes to do.  So it's not a consistent workout as you are often stopping to watch what she does and learn the moves at the very slow pace she demonstrates in.  It's great for the first couple times around but again, once you've mastered them (which won't take long, maybe a 2-3 times), you don't need to see the demo part again. The portion of the video where she runs through it at regular pace (twice) only lasts 7 minutes! You may get 4-5 uses out of this. ;-(",1364342400,3,676,4.357142857142857
2877532,4,B000RZP472,I think this workout is great.  It is true the only music is live drummers in the background but I do not think it takes away from the workout.  I have a lot of fun doing it and I do sweat.  It is not as difficult as doing Jillian or Bob Harper but do you really expect that from a dance workout?  I don't think the moves are difficult to follow and the workout is a great break from more traditional workouts.  I think I am going to order another one of her DVD's.,1363737600,,465,3.904255319148936

2877534,4,B000RZP472,"I bought this DVD because I love to dance and I'm fascinated with Afro-Brazilian culture and dance.

Quenia and her girls warm you up then lead you through step by step movements of the Samba Reggae Workout.  She ends the workout, but not before changing into a RED bodysuit!  That's when it gets real... and you better have the routine down because she isn't waiting for you.  She leads you through the entire routine no instructions, just move it!  I burned 700 calories doing the entire routine and I had a ball learning moves from Bahia...She loses count once during transition, but quickly regains her composure.  I think this is a great workout if you are a quick study and love to dance to the rhythm of the samba playing.",1361664000,,729,4.569230769230769
2877535,2,B000RZP472,"I am a newly engaged 29 year old woman who is trying to lose weight for my walk down the aisle. I bought this dvd because i was sick of all of my other workout dvds and wanted something similar to zumba. first of all the sound quality was really bad. You could barely understand or hear the instructor. the whole workout is like learning a dance. you slowly add in each section and periodically run thru the dance, until you've learned the whole thing. There is only one dance on the dvd. I thought i would love this but was sadly disappointed. I thought it was boring and didn't get my heart rate up.",1360281600,,601,4.234782608695652
2877536,2,B000RZP472,"this is not a workout dvd.  don't get me wrong the dance instructor is awesome, very energetic and fun.  she spends to much time trying to teach the steps and repeats it over and over again (stopping and starting).  it was so tiresome and frustrating. this is an instructional dance techniques video. in order for it to be a true  workout dvd, the routine should last more than about 3 minutes.  i wasted my money on this (and i hate wasting my money).  DO NOT purchase this dvd if you are looking for a true aerobic workout.  if you want to learn afro/latin dance steps then this is the dvd for you.",1359849600,5,600,4.303571428571429
2877537,1,B000RZP472,I thought there was much to it.  Did not dance the samba nor the reggae.  Used it only once and will use it only when I really do not want to exercise.,1359676800,,151,3.6875
2877538,4,B000RZP472,"In this video it doesn't really matter. She does a great job breaking down the steps so that anyone can dance. The first part of the video will seem a little slow to an advanced dancer. If you are an advanced dancer and pick up quickly just move to the 2nd section..that is the part that gets you sweating. Unfortunately it's not very long and go by very very quickly. So you'll have to play it several times to really get in a good workout. Lots of fun. Great fun for someone who is having trouble getting motivated...and likes to try something new.
For someone who is looking for a fast paced workout for an hour or half hour, you will like the idea of the video, but it will leave you wanting something more. Be advised that there is no music only drums. The drums are awesome but  if you're like me and get energized with the music, this will leave you wishing there was more music to accompany the drums.",1359417600,,909,4.284883720930233
2877539,4,B000RZP472,"So, I ordered this DVD after reading the reviews, the good, bad and ugly. I needed a dance work out that would challenge me and keep my interest beyond the first week.
Unless you are a professional dancer, this WILL do the trick.
No, it's not masterly produced with 50 different camera angles, but it will burn some serious holes into your fat deposits.

It's shot on a stage with the drummers in the background.
People, it's called SAMBA Reggae workout, so stop complaining about the drums.
It's like ordering a salad and complain about it being raw.

I had no problems hearing or understanding the instructions.
The foot work takes some coordination until you have it down, but it's by no means difficult.
I'd suggest to watch the entire work out before attempting the routine. That seems to work for me.
Having that said - I'm so out of shape - I ""surrendered"" after 20 minutes.
This will burn some serious calories.",1357862400,2,919,4.631901840490798

2877541,2,B000RZP472,"This routine is good because you can learn the basic moves of samba...but its not like a workout.

That's why I love this DVD, you don't have to be a contortionist to learn the dance steps, they aren't very complicated.  Compared to the instructor my hips are cast in cement but I'm starting to loosen up, if anyone watched me they'd  crack up laughing.  It's so much fun you forget you're exercising.

She spends about 10-15 minutes stretching and warming up which is actually a good thing for me because I take about that long to get warm. However, as opposed to teaching a few short routines and repeating them, she spends over 30 minutes teaching one very long routine which you perform for about 10 minutes at the end. Again, decent routine and she is really entertaining, but if you are looking for a good workout...this isn't really it.

But even though I'm really bad at it, this workout is really fun and I look forward to doing it. It's really intense, it especially works the legs, and I think Quenia's warm- up is sub-par, if you don't want to be intensely sore the next day, stretch!

When I don't feel like going to the gym, or when I'm trying to mix up my workout routine, this video comes in handy.  1st, I like the fact that she's a real woman, meaning, she has lots of curves and is not afraid to shake them!!  2nd, I love the live drummers.  I also do African Dance and the music really makes me feel at home in this video...also the movements are similar to African Dance.  3rd, it really works up a sweat and I'm usually worn out by the end of the video. I know those calories are truly burning!!

This is by far the best of all of her videos (I've purchased 2 others and rarely look at them.)  I always keep coming back to Samba Reggae workout!!  It may take a few times to get the moves...but don't give up!  Make sure you start at warm up and go straight through.  You may have to stop the DVD to catch your breath and to get water...and that's find too, just get up and finish your workout.  I would have given this DVD 5 stars but she initally confused me in regards to going left or right....so I just follow whichever direction she's going in.

Just move your body and follow along the best you can- MOVE! I like that it is not an overly produced video like most work-out videos.

I've done other dance fitness videos and I had to rewind a lot to master the moves (ahem DWTS), but not this video. I own a large collection of exercise dvds and I've attended live Zumba at the YMCA, but this is the best cuing I've ever seen. Additionally, the music and choreography are amazing-I feel like I'm at Carnaval. The moves are very Capoeira-like (not surprising) with a combination of African dance and martial arts, with Latin flavor. I feel very feminine and sexy while doing this. Word of warning: this is not ballroom Samba, it's not Zumba, and don't expect Reggae music with steel drums.

Some folks have said they found the music monotonous...I didn't really find it to be a problem.  Of course, I used to be in marching band and LOVED marching near the percussion so I could feel the drums rattle my spine.

Even the Workout #1 which shows you how to do everything and repeats the routine several times, is good once you know all of the steps. The Workout #2 is a quick 7 minute routine that I do after crunches, lunges, and pushups.

This DVD is very much worth getting, even if you look nothing like the person on the cover of it.  (In truth, SHE doesn't look much like that person either, it must be heavily photoshopped.  In my opinion, the real her looks a lot better than the cover image.)

The music is great, the drums make it so lively! I have two left feet, so I got confused a lot (I've only done it for the first time today), but it's very much worth it.

2877588,4,B000RZP472,"I can't help but love a fun workout that keeps me smiling the entire time.  Quenia is lively and full of energy, but what I love most is how learning the choreography is structured.  In my bellydance classes, instructors tend to teach each section of the routine one section at a time.  After they've finished teaching you each section they then take it from the top, at which point I've found I've frequently forgotten at least half of what I've learned.  I love that Quenia works through the entire routine each time she adds on a new section.  I've never learned choreography so quickly.  Granted, this might make the video a little less interesting to some for regular use, but I can definitely see popping it into the rotation at least once a week.

The less good: The movement are very big, so for the most part I found that I could easily process what she was doing.  If you're unable to tell from watching her, though, you will be out of luck.  Her idea of instruction is to pause, change angles, point at her leg and say ""see like this.""  While angle changes can sometimes be useful, they're not always enough.  For me, much like samba, bellydance involved learning a new movement vocabulary.  Fortunately, most good bellydance instructors have done a lot to verbalize those movements.  I can understand that it would break up the workout pace to include a lot of instruction in the routine section, but it would be nice to see it somewhere in the video, even if it were in an expanded ""basic step"" section.",1263600000,,1516,4.57037037037037

The dancing is good.  But it's not for me.  It would take me a long time to get all this down.  Not because she doesn't cue well.  I think she does alright.  I guess the moves themselves don't seem natural to me.  Maybe someone with more dance background would enjoy it more, but I don't think I'll be using it much.

Workout #2 is the complete dance routine which takes about 7 mins but would have you panting in the end especially if you repeat it twice or three times. so in about 15 mins flat, you have a great cardio workout completed.",1261958400,,402,4.0375

I'm a born dancer and pick up most dances pretty quick as I did with this.  I found that this DVD did not offer enough variety.  Like another reviewer said, there ARE ONLY two different sections of the DVD, a slow section and a faster section.  I would have preferred a leveled DVD including different moves.  The instructor is great and the drums are ok...they are monotonous and again I'm speaking from african dance experience and other cultural dance styles.  I wouldn't even consider this reggae.  Honestly, I got more of a work out from the Bollywood dance DVD's than this as far as high impact and sweat factor.

I've been rehabbing it and I thought I would try this workout to test the strength of my ankle.  Honestly, it was a little rough with the jumping and twisting.  I can only imagine how bad it would be for someone with knee or hip problems.  If you don't have any of those three issues, you shouldn't have a problem.

I also have zero dancing ability so some of the hip shaking, isolation and arm movements when put together were a little confusing.  This is only the second dance workout I've done (the first was The Grind with Eric Neis so you have an idea of how long it's been).  I still think it's for beginners though.  I've always thought the point of a workout was to be somewhat challenging and it was.

You need more space than I have available.  There is a lot of traveling and some kicking so make sure you move the coffee table and couches out of the way (especially if you live in an apartment like I do).

All of that being said, I really enjoyed it.  My heart rate was up and I was sweating.  There are short breaks while you're learning the next step so you have a little bit of time to catch your breath, but make sure you walk through the new steps with her because it's easy to get lost when the movements speed up again.

I hope to start running in the next month or so, but I can definitely see myself tossing this DVD in once or twice a week.  It would probably get boring if you did it 5x a week, but I don't see it getting stale if it's part of a rotation.  It's fun - not quite a 5 star workout, and I would have given it a 3 because of my ankle, but I can't blame her for that so I gave it a very strong 4 stars.",1252108800,6,1769,4.011428571428572

Quenia is a great fluid, graceful dancer w/body awareness & has a great, fun, friendly, patient personality, great cues & teaching & the two backup dancers also have fun dancing which is important.
You learn 1 type of samba step & many other traditional Latin dance moves that are fun to do.
Intro: 2 min
Basic Dance Step/Learn the beat: 3 min
Warm-up: 12 min - Some great stretching, lunges, ab work, neck stretching, rib, hip stretching & circles, etc.
Workout 1/Teaching Segment: 37 min - Quenia w/2 backup dancers teaches you a move in 1/4 time, even turning her body so you can see it from the side when necessary, making sure you move out your body, and even though there are 2 dancers behind her, she calls out YOUR left/right. Once she's done with instruction, she shows it in 1/2 time, then has you practice a few times, then at slightly slower then normal latin tempo, but a good speed for beginners since this is new to you. Once you learn another move, she has you practice that, then the move before-hand so you can feel the link, then from the top to build a routine. It's a great pace to keep you moving so you're never bored.
Workout 2/Very Fast/More Jump/Hoping: 5 min - Here you do the routine several times w/everyone jumping higher, adding more hops, and moving at breakneck speed like most Latin dances do.
There is no cool down, she introduces the band/dancers after.

This routine involves a good amount of hopping, but you can always make it more low-impact & still do it easily like in the workout 1 section. This is not ballroom style.

The combination is a good one and the fast version IS a good workout but there's no variety beyond that. 2. There is no cool down.

You slowly build until you are going through the whole routine. I wasn't even going to buy this DVD, but I'm so glad I did!!!! The moves are easy enough that anyone can do them with a little practice. I found I wasn't getting frustrated as I often do with some dance DVD's because I can't look anywhere near what they do. The high energy hopping and clapping is blended with moves that make you feel sexy but still a lot of innocent fun. Best of all I really feel like I'm getting a good workout! Without the ugh I'm working out feeling. You will love this DVD!!!",1236470400,,694,4.346153846153846

The music is monotonous, don't get me wrong I love drums, but the beat hardly ever changed (the drum beat you hear in the sample video is the same beat played throughout the entire 45 mins of work out 1 and 7 mins of work out 2).

I got up a sweat just watching the CD and I haven't even tried it out yet!!

2877610,5,B000RZP472,"The samba Quenia Ribeiro teaches us in this sensational DVD was birthed in Salvador, Bahia, and has deep African roots. It has found the perfect interpreter in Quenia, who dances with dazzling speed, strength and control. What Baryshnikov is to ballet, Quenia is to samba.  Watch her and be amazed!

After Quenia and her Grupo Ribeiro give us a ""Welcome,"" Quenia shows us some ""Basic Steps,"" and then we get a terrific ""Warm-up,"" which is slow and powerful. We next move to the ""Workouts:""

In ""Workout #1"" Quenia shows us a set of steps, repeats them and then adds on the next set of steps, until we have a lengthy combination that gives new meaning to the word aerobic. Quenia says it's ""a great way to exercise and burn calories,"" and have lots of fun too! If you don't have the necessary natural abilities (sense of rhythm, agility, etc.), muscular strength and tip top aerobic conditioning you may have trouble keeping up, but do what you can, and enjoy it.

In ""Workout #2"" the pace is picked up, and it's continuous, with the kind of energy that would leave some of our million dollar athletes panting in the dust. After the ""Workouts,"" we meet the fabulous 5 man Grupo Ribeiro led by Nick Birmelin and dancers Ana and Nao.

Quenia is one of the most dynamic performers you'll ever see, and she will motivate you to try this fire-in-the-soul/fire-in-the-soles-of-the-feet dancing, expand your horizons, and learn from the best. Challenge yourself and the rewards will be worth it!",1222819200,19,1487,4.770428015564202

im blown away.  this video is so good!!!  the live drumming is awesome! the best sound track ive heard for any dance or work out video ive seen.

the dancing is killer. not ""workout"" styled moves you'd be embaressed to break out in a club.  these are real awesome dance moves.  highly recommended to chicks, but guys do this stuff too.  i think its called bahia(?)samba there are some decent clips of brazilian capoeira dudes doing this stuff on youtube.  lots of fast body waves. super fun. great  core workout.

yes, this video is also a full workout with stretches and etc.

top notch production value - it looks and sounds killer.  and a great price.  this is one of my new favorites",1216684800,2,827,4.561643835616438
2877616,4,B000RZP472,"This is a great ""workout"" for a change of pace. I would not consider this a DVD that would be part of a regular rotation. However, if you are looking for something fun, challenging and different, this is definitely it. This is definitely designed to be more of a workout than Quenia Ribeiro's Samba DVD.

It begins with an excellent warm up and stretch routine. Then Quenia moves into the choreographed routine that provides a challenging cardio workout. She's great at going over the moves and layering so that you are ready to build and move on to the next part of the routine. The live drummers are a fantastic addition as you feel as though you are in an African/Brazilian dance class. Everyone seems to be genuinely having a good time doing the routine, which makes the DVD even more fun and engaging. My only concern would be the knees. You have to make sure not to go overboard on some of the more advanced movements because you can definitely injure your knees on this one. Other than that, I have no complaints.",1216339200,,1020,4.543478260869565
2877617,4,B000RZP472,"Created as a dance workout, this DVD is fantastic.  Quenia is clearly a gifted dancer and instructor who thoroughly enjoys her work.  That she presents her workout against the backdrop of a live band and others who seem to enjoy the music and dance makes this DVD stand out in its genre.  My quibbles with this DVD are that she does not seem to be wired and it is not always easy to hear her over the live music.  She gives good instruction but it's not always easy to hear what she is saying.

This DVD presents a deceptively challenging workout.  Within five minutes of it Quenia has gotten your heart rate up and isolated weaker body areas.  If you have problems with your knees or hips this may not be the workout for you.  It is, however, moderately intense and very sexy.  What a fun way to work out!",1214524800,4,806,4.32

2877624,5,B000RZP472,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite workout DVD's hands down.

Pluses
1)  Quenia Ribero is amazing.  Her moves are fantastic.  Her energy is inspiring.  Background dancers know the routine and are really good.  Especially, the one on the right. Keep an eye out for her.

2)  This is a huge improvement from her Dance Today: Samba video.  In this video she explains very well that her left is your right.  She also breaks down the moves much better and there is less down time between moves.

3)  I like that there is a warm up.

4)  The routine is fun.  I haven't counted but I think it has like 15+ moves.  Much better than some tapes I have that teach you only like 6.

Minuses

1)  I thought they could have repeated the full routine at the end of section one at least 3-4 times completely before moving to section 2.

2)  The workout is intense.  I wish there was a cool down section.  But maybe they sacrificed that to include a longer workout so ...

3) Awaiting her 3rd dvd  :( when is it coming?

Helpful hints
1) This work out will use every muscle in your body.  Don't skip the warm up. Do a cool down on your own when you finish (even though there is not one on the tape to relax after you finish).

2)  When she explains the moves.  Don't just stand their and watch.  Keep marching in place so you don't lose your heart rate.

3)  If the moves seem to complicated keep going.  After practicing a few times you'll build muscle memory and be moving like a pro in no time.

4) I didn't get all the moves down until the 3rd 4th time I did this DVD.  The explanation was good but my body wouldn't comply.  But it gave
me something to look forward to conquering the next time so I appreciated the challenge.

4)  Fair warning.  This tapes makes a lot of other workout DVDs seem boring. I've done it a least three times a week for the last 2 months. (More than any other tape I own except 1)",1199404800,218,1903,4.149171270718232

2877626,4,B000RZP472,"This is the second samba work out by Quenia Rivero and watch out, she is energetic!
This is intense body work out and if you don't believe it, try it! This program is well worth above its price.
This program begins with a good thorough warm up session targeting important muscle groups necessary for this intense dance.
Initially Quenia breaks down the basic steps for samba reggae and their variations. This footwork is fast paced. The choreography is lengthy as it is being layed out but when set to the drumming, it will go by rather quickly. The two sessions set you at different paces, so take your pick. The first segment is about 44 minutes, the second is shorter as it is quicker. As you begin and gather speed, the second session is really fun. There is ample repetition and the segments are easy to learn. Set at slow speed and work up to your potential.
Quenia introduces her band and her dancers, as the band does a phenomenal percussion number. Personally I love drum circles, and listening to this distinct drumming does get your mood going.
I would categorize this as a cardio work out, although it is at times high impact aerobic and excellent at that. If I were looking to find fault, the drumming was really distracting in the background during the warm up, the instructor sounded like she was yelling out the drill. Overall, it is titled as a work out, and that it is! Both of Quenia's work-out dvd's are fun and a must have!",1197244800,12,1444,4.53639846743295
