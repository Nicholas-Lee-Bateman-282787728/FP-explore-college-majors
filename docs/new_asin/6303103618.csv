7837802,3,6303103618,"The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle, 1949 film

This story begins with a view of a courthouse in a small town. An official group wants to condemn the Kettles home due to its poor condition. Ma and Pa talk about clothes. Youve done wonders with this place. They have a radio and talk about hygiene. What about the roof on the hen house? Pa will fix it after he can borrow nails and wood. They learn about the proposal to condemn their home. But Pa won a new house in the King Henry tobacco contest! The Kettle children greet their visitors. Ma Kettle will talk to them. The Seattle Daily Times reports who won a Palatial Modern Home. People travel by train and eat in a dining car. Tom talks to a woman writer about his chicken incubator and people in general. Then he returns home. A television reporter will broadcast the Kettles entering their new modern home.

Pushbuttons control the radio, record player, and television. We see how things work. [Where is the ladder for those bunk beds?] Ma and Pa watch television. A typical robust American family? Will they push the wrong buttons? Can things be too automatic? Where are you? Come and get it yells Ma. Pa senses a new taste in the oatmeal. I love grits. What happens if that meat is overcooked? Pa learns about their water faucet. Tom explains how his incubator works. Proper saves the lives of chicks. Creating an affordable on will help small farmers. Now Pa is elected Chairman of the County Fair. Billy Reed sells merchandise. Will a busybody try to make trouble for Pa? Note the modern appliances in the kitchen. Pa left the sun lamps on when he shaved! Scarlet fever? People arrive for a party. There is cake and ice cream. Would Pa want to go back to their old place?

Tom reads Kim Parkers article on the Kettle family. Tom uses a horse and wagon to go to the train station. Real gone. [What is more transient than slang?] Tom and Kim are in love. [A calendar without the year is unusual.] That busybody called the tobacco company to get Pa Kettle disqualified. Will they lose their home? Sunburn? Bad luck? Will bad publicity affect Tom? Will Ma and her kids protect their home? [No problem in gun owning then.] A telegram arrives for Pa. Can he help Ma and the kids? I aint going. They hear explosions from their old house. Pa was using dynamite to dig a well (in stony ground). Could anything go wrong? Billy Reed solves the problem. There are services for Pa. Then a wagon load of Indians arrives to chase the law away. Ill teach you to get yourself blown up! Tom and Kim hitch up. Another telegram arrives: they won an all expenses paid trip to New York in a Bubble-Cola contest!

The Ma and Pa Kettle characters were taken from Betty MacDonalds book The Egg and I, which tells about her experiences as a chicken farmer. She wrote other humorous books. Today small family farms are fewer in number since the 1950s. Betty suffered from TB, which shortened her life. Modern drugs made TB curable (except in poor countries). Eating butter and eggs tended to prevent TB where oatmeal is the main food source. Betty was sued by those who claimed to be the model for her characters. Does this couple remind you of the Archie Bunker show?",1388361600,,3208,4.506872852233677

7837805,5,6303103618,"This is the first starring role for Ma & Pa Kettle, but not the first film they appeared in.  The very first film Majorie Main and Percy Kilbride appeared in as ""Ma & Pa Kettle"", along with Richard Long was ""The Egg And I"" (1947).  They were only minor characters in the film, but made such an impact and was considered so down-home funny that it was decided they should be given a movie of their own.  Thus ""Ma & Pa Kettle"" (1949) was made.  In fact, they made eight more films to follow.  The films are quite wholesome and with Ma & Pa Kettle living on the farm, I'm sure you will enjoy the country-life humor.  Ma & Pa Kettle didn't always stay on the farm.  They did go to the fair and traveled to the city and even Hawaii.  In this film, they finally get to move into a new model home.  Wait until you see all the fancy stuff this house can do.  I highly recommend you see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Egg-and-I-VHS/dp/6302423236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Egg and I [VHS</a>] (1947) first, to get the good flavor of the films and appreciate the humor.

7837806,5,6303103618,"Percy Kilbride and Marjorie Main star in this spin-off of the EGG AND I, a 1947 flick in which they were scene-stealing supporting characters.  The Ma & Pa Kettle series - corny and unsophisticated as they were - proved huge money-makers for Universal Pictures. The hoi polloi just loved watching the antics of these loveable country bumpkins who lived out in Hicksville!  In this offering, Ma & Pa play the down-and-out parents of 15 kids who are faced with being evicted from their ramshackle home.  Pa wins a slogan contest for a tobacco company, and wins his wife and brood an ultra modern (for 1949) brand-new, fully automated house.  Local grouch Esther Dale (as the hilarious Birdie Hicks, a sour old beldame with the face of curds) is jealous of the Kettles' new fortune and accuses Pa of plagiarizing the slogan...Note the the eldest son - Tom - is played by 22 year-old Richard Long who would go on to play Jarrod Barkley on TV's THE BIG VALLEY.",1032998400,17,955,4.666666666666667
