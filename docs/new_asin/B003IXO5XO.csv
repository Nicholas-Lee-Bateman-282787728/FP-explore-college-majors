4128357,5,B003IXO5XO,"This is not a review but a request for the rest to the shows to be released in season form.  My cooking has gotten better thanks to the wonderful teaching techniques of Alton Brown.  Instead of blindly following a recipe, I now know what is happening. I am gaining the knowledge to change a recipe with out setting off the smoke detector or my wife calling poison control after each meal. <vbg> My hope is to have this invaluable reference in my DVD library so I can free up space on the TiVo, and continue my transformation as a home cook.  Also, so my kids will finally eat my cooking without complaint <grin>.

Season vs topic release.  I will agree that the topic release is a nice way to get a narrow subset of the show, a set cogent to your needs.  However, I prefer the season release because it shows the growth  and maturation of the show and the characters.

Thanks for your time.",1295395200,55,890,4.351515151515152
4128358,5,B003IXO5XO,"If anyone is trying to find this, last I checked Target was still stocking it (Target Exclusive release S1 and S2).  Pretty cheap there too, I have both seasons, hopefully they come out with more.",1290988800,28,196,4.6
4128359,5,B003IXO5XO,"This is exactly what it claims to be.  It has all the episodes from this season, plus a bunch of Alton's shorts, all in TV quality (low quality 480i) - which is all they were filmed in originally anyway.  They are certainly better than the fish-eye-distorted versions which currently air on FoodTV-HD.

I don't know why this product is so under-the-radar.  If you, like me, had a concern it was not real, fear not.  It is just what it claims to be, and, for the price, is well worth it.",1280966400,24,486,4.355555555555555
4128360,4,B003IXO5XO,I suppose I should have purchased this when it was only $40-50.  Does Alton deliver it with a meal or two?  Out of print?  Typo?  Just wondering.  :),1344729600,,149,4.178571428571429
4128361,5,B003IXO5XO,"C'mon Alton, Food Network, and Amazon, we want ALL of the seasons on DVD.

Good Eats is one of the VERY few ""cooking"" shows that has a continuing attraction; beyond its initial run.

It's instructional, it's funny, it has a host who actually knows how to present ""cookery"" to a mass audience. Not only is GE entertaining, it is a continuing reference to which we can look again and again. Want to know how to cook potatoes, it's there, want to know how to cream corn, it's there, want to know how to smoke salmon, it's there, want to know how to produce the absolutely perfect standing rib roast..it's there!!!!

Amazon, Food Network, Mr. Brown, WE WANT ALL OF THE SEASONS!!!",1339804800,23,675,4.56198347107438

4128364,5,B003IXO5XO,I was glad to find this season of Good Eats on DVD. It was at the right price on Amazon. I only wish AB would sell his other seasons of Good Eats for his large fan base.,1332633600,2,169,3.5945945945945947

4128366,5,B003IXO5XO,"Good Eats was at it's best earlier in the franchise, so this is another great season.  Alton Brown is witty, smart and just plain fun to watch.

Target sold seasons 1 and 2 - I'm doubtful we will get the rest of the seasons in the proper complete season format, but well worth your purchase for a great TV show.",1320451200,,311,4.166666666666667
4128367,5,B003IXO5XO,Love this!  I just wish they would come out with the rest of the seasons on DVD (14 total seasons).  We are pairing up the episodes with the 3 cookbook series as cooking classes for our kids.  Really hope they at least announce that the releases were in the works.  I would get them all.,1315094400,,287,4.163636363636364

8397742,5,B003IXO5XO,"Unlike current grouping of Alton Brown's show, Good Eats, this is actually his second season episode by episode. The downside: VERY EXPENSIVE for a short amount of entertainment.",1434067200,2,178,5.392857142857143

8397744,5,B003IXO5XO,"Alton Brown is the man.  My husband will even watch his show ""Good Eats"" with me.  He says Alton makes everything so simple, even he likes to get in the kitchen now.",1402358400,,165,4.125
8397745,5,B003IXO5XO,"Okay, first - really do love all the episodes of Good Eats I have watched. That said - Food Network, please release these videos by season! Why? I am glad you asked! Alton Brown wrote 3 large books with tons and tons of information (Volume 1 the Early Years, Volume 2 the Middle Years, Volume 3 the Later Years). Each book is written by, you guessed it - episode! The books are packed with information and make a great middle school/high school food science curriculum/culinary (backed up with additional sources yes) program.
Of course, you need the episodes to go along with each chapter of the book. By not having the seasons released - the value of what this book could actually ""do"" is diminished quite a bit. So, could you maybe do the world a favor (okay, maybe not the entire world, how about food nerds with little food nerds) a let these two same named projects be used in tandem with each other as intended.",1392768000,7,918,4.502994011976048
8397746,4,B003IXO5XO,Alton Brown is a great entertainer and provides very helpful information.  The one disc just has a lot more desserts than I would like.,1375660800,2,135,4.625
8397747,5,B003IXO5XO,Alton Brown is zany and  kids love to watch his zany way of explaining the science of food.  I want to get every season of Good Eats show so that my kids and I can learn more about food in a fun and informative way.,1357344000,2,215,3.7555555555555555

8397749,1,B003IXO5XO,"I love the show so I told my mom that I wouldn't mind one of the seasons for Christmas so she was going to order it but after I looked up the ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS PRICE, I told her not to. Give me a brake. I like the show but No one in there right mind would pay this much. It's a little
