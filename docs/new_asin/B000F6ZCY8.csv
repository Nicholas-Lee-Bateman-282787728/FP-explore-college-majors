I'm too angry at the moment to comment calmly on the malicious use of the media, so I will merely cast my vote, and hope to update this mini-review later. We learn almost nothing about President Putin from this film, but we learn a lot about talking, smirking heads, such as ""a businessman,"" and ""Voice of America."" Sadly, two of President Putin's teachers were persuaded to take part in this disaster, and they deserve an apology from the makers.

If there were zero stars, I would give all of them to this ""Biography.""",1433116800,2,592,4.5327102803738315

I just wish USA and RUSSIA could stop all the fighting, become brothers and sisters and end the strife!  Every one has good qualities but if we do not see them, sometimes we misjudge some of our most influential leaders. What a shame!
You will not be dissapointed with this bio, it is worth investing it.
Pray for peace USA, and pray for unity to this little fragile world of ours.
