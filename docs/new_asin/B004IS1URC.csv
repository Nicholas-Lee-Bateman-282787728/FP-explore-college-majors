4387337,3,B004IS1URC,"As terrible as this movie is, I really enjoyed it. At it's heart is a cute little love story between two guys and it's a fresh take on the ""vampire-in-love-with-a-human"" story that is, although words cannot described how creepy everything about it is. It really is a crap movie, but I enjoyed watching the two main characters together. Oh, but I must say, epic-fail on the ""big"" fight scene, though, cause it doesn't look like they tried. If you can put up with low quality indie films and enjoy a cute(but akward) love story between two guys, rent it (and yes, there is a decent penis shot if that's what your looking for, but don't expect pants off from any of the main characters or even a real sex scene).",1312329600,12,709,4.461538461538462
4387338,2,B004IS1URC,"Vampire Boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. This movie is pretty dull stuff. Even Twilight was better. And the actor who played Caleb was horrible. A lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. I think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""Pretty Boys"" instead. That's the point of this movie anyway. The point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. That counts for something, right?",1311120000,,584,4.571428571428571
4387339,1,B004IS1URC,The previews were miss leading. I thaught this would be a hetrosexual romance story. Like boy looks for the girl of his dreams. Not Boy looks for Boy. I didn't even finish the movie since it does not intrest me.,1309132800,,211,4.3
4387340,2,B004IS1URC,"Not awfull, but i didn't know that vampires can't use contractions. That's right, the main vampire can't use contractions. Why, I don't know. It might just be bad acting.

 I blame it on the studio that made this film. It's less than B grade, but still has a few good moments. Very few. My favorite is the full front body pan of a realy hunky straight boy that lasts less than five seconds.

Bottom line: If your drunk or stoned it's more fun than re-runs of 'Cops', but that about it.",1308355200,19,485,4.3076923076923075
4387341,2,B004IS1URC,"I was not a fan, although I did not expect much.  I knew going into it that the movie would ne campy and corny to say the least but watching the trailer, I expected a little better acting. The movie might be one to watch when you have had something to drink and you are with friends that can laugh over the horrible plot holes and script.  It is not worth the time or money if you are trying to find a good movie for a night in.  The boys were hot...but be forewarned there is some fully erect penis action that was unnecessary.",1307232000,9,528,4.0576923076923075

4387343,3,B004IS1URC,"When I first saw this movie I expected it to be bad. Bad acting, bad cinematography and there were some ""wtf is this"" moments. However, as someone who critics films the story line does have promise. So lets take a look, a gay film called Vampire Boys, key word here is boys showing muscled chest and abs... Okay it's another gay cheesy film and I don't have to watch it to know that. If you're the type of person that looks to Hollywood level films and everything else is crap then this is crap. If you know how to look for the story, the plot, if you can see what the writers and directors were trying to do and take note of the young gay men that seemingly always show skin then it is what you'd expect.",1481155200,,705,4.153284671532846

4387346,5,B004IS1URC,Another gay movie of sort.  Not complete gay.  Likely more of mix bisexual than gay to gay.  I won't get too much into it without explain the whole situation.  All I can said give this movie a chance and you can decide for yourself whether its worth your time or not as it is worth my time.  I don't care about gay or bisexual. Its the connection between 2 persons that make it worth for far more than just a lifetime but eternity and ever more forever.....,1475107200,,457,4.206896551724138

4387368,5,B004IS1URC,I found this and I love it! I love that its not to much fighting abd blood like regular vamp movies. I really enjoyed that it had more relationship stuff and the why they act and move this movie is my absolute favorite. There is one scene i skip everytime but other than that if you don't over think it its such a great movie to watch. I personally love the way jasin talks!,1465516800,,374,4.0675675675675675

4387371,3,B004IS1URC,"The boys are what make this video worth watching. The story is just ok, production values and acting are sub-par. The few ""scary"" parts aren't scary; it would be gory if the blood actually looked like blood. I almost turned it off close to the beginning. Then they showed Caleb in his underwear. There were many scenes with scantily clad college boys making out, and some brief nudity. If that doesn't appeal to you, I wouldn't bother with this video; it has little else to offer.",1463875200,2,480,4.593023255813954

4387385,3,B004IS1URC,"Honestly, I would have never thought it was possible to see a vampire movie that sucked worse than Twilight - yet here's this one.

All right, so it was cheesy and hilarious - thought I'm sure the author and director meant it to be a serious film (and believe me I'm no critic, I ""love"" The Princes' Bride) - I admit to LMAO.  Hence the high rating.

So go ahead and take a lookie.  I promised that it will suck all the way through.",1447459200,,432,4.107142857142857

4387396,2,B004IS1URC,"Its a fact that appreciators of the gay vampire genre don't expect much: a lot of bare chests, some eye candy, actors that barely deliver their lines, some violence, but not too graphic. Well, this film has it all. The plot is very simple: its running out time for Jasin (Jason Lockhart) to find a new candidate of vampire to perpetuate the brood, or all of them die. He has as woman willing to become a Vamp, but fells attracted to the nice sweet boy Caleb (Christian Ferrer) who maybe The One, as long as Jasin convinces him of the marvelous live of eternal youth. The actors aren't that bad as the ones chosen for the sequel, but don't expect too much. I was mostly sympathetically attracted  to Caleb, the gentle and campy candidate, who touched me in a pleasant way.

4387431,1,B004IS1URC,"Horrible vampire movie. Extremely low budget. The plot made absolutely no sense. The acting was horrible. The conflict was absurd. The resolution was lackluster. The fight scenes were lame. The ""special FX"" were non-existent.
The only good thing about the movie was most of the guys had nice bodies(though they really didn't have attractive faces) & went shirtless the majority of the time. The sex scenes were lame, especially considering they went the extra mile to actually show a guy's penis, they might as well had made intense sex scenes & not just do cut-aways.
I really don't see the point of the actresses in this movie. All the guys in it were obviously gay (which was evident when they started talking).

Some new twists on vampire lore; some other movies have used the reflection, cross, and sunshine stuff to a degree, this had a slightly different turn to it which made it a touch more interesting.

I guess my biggest problem with the film was it made me think ""Twilight"" in some respects, albeit substituting Caleb for Bella, and of course, no nudity in Twilight (Jacob going shirtless does not count *winks*).  Not sure why my mind connected with ""Twilight"" and this film - these vampires didn't sparkle (and we all know real vampires don't sparkle!)

4387529,5,B004IS1URC,"I LOVE this movie! :) The subject matter was enough for me to buy it right after I found it.
Personally, I think that the others who have reviewed it were expecting too much, and that's why they didn't enjoy it.
For a movie with a really low budget, and that was shot in six days, this is AMAZING! :)

Yes, there are some issues. Jasin seems a little standoffish and stiff in some scenes, but I think that it's just because his social skills are rusty after only spending time with his Coven, who really don't care if he's super nice and friendly or not, and also because he does not want to mess up and scare Caleb away.

And as for the fact that he rarely uses contractions?.. So what. He's a hundred years old. You'd get used to talking a certain way. Why should he change that now?.. O'o

I really honestly prefer films with low budgets, because they have to be creative to make the sets, and because they have to focus more on the conversations between the characters. Yes, fight scenes are cool, I won't lie, but it's the dialogue and relationships, the feelings between the characters that I really care about. And I believe this delivers. It was completely worth the money, and I've watched it almost ten times since it was delivered! :)",1346630400,28,1245,4.404347826086957
4387530,1,B004IS1URC,honestly i would not waste my time on this movie. the acting was horrible and at one point you could see of the character's mics on their shirts. just bad all around!!,1344643200,,167,4.25
4387531,2,B004IS1URC,"This movie was not as bad as others have written however with that being said it was not good either.  The acting was high schoolish at best.  The actors gave the impression of remembering their lines before they spoke.  The settings were the same ones with different angles or even close up shots.  really no imagination to the sets.  There was very little interaction with the people of the supposed town and so that gave the impression of the cast being the only ones in the town.

Finally the fact that the beautiful bodies get naked was not enough to warrant buying this movie or seeing it.  Sooner or later someone will get the idea that gay men want substance in thier movies and not just eye candy and obviously staged sex scenes between actors.",1335916800,2,753,4.533333333333333
4387532,1,B004IS1URC,"Now I know vampires suck. And gays too. Cool. But this whole movies sucks. I love horror flicks and also a good gay drama. But this film is simply boring. Where the vampire could be threatening and erotic at the same time, the action is hardly shown. The characters mainly talk. Big mistake, because the acting and dialog is too bad. Teen Wolf was fun, but there are no really good gay horror flicks at this time, I fear. Therefor I prefer to keep watching gay dramas and  horror films with straights who are much more sensual then the guys in this one.",1334102400,4,553,4.368932038834951
4387533,4,B004IS1URC,"..you don't expecting something big of this movie.

I like it because: Dylan Vox is in! Ok, he's not a good actor - also not the other cast-memeber -, but he's sexy, in my mind.

The movie is low budget, has terrible acting but beautiful guys and is also somehow fun. Somehow like ""Twilight"" or  ""The Vampire Diaries"" but without Budget.... so the movie isn't bad at all.

DVD otherwise is ok for this low budget movie.

FaZIT: only 4 stars for Dylan Vox (sorry, love that guy) - 2 stars for the movie.",1329350400,,502,4.297872340425532
4387534,2,B004IS1URC,Truely fits in the class of B movies...Poor acting allround. I think they could have used the 300 dollar that it probably took to make this movie and put it to better use......Please do not waste your time or money...,1326672000,,217,4.45
4387535,2,B004IS1URC,"Vampires and gay people.  What a combination.  Those two popular subjects should be an opportunity to have some fun.  Well, as for me, I could barely sit through it.  The entire movie seemed to be based on odd coincidences.  The only actor I was at all familiar with was Dylan Vox.  While there was something that bothered me in Homewreckers and Longhorns, he really set my teeth on edge in this one.  He's not much better in hard core,  so I'm not sure which way is trying to switch over.

Dreadful.",1325980800,,500,4.406593406593407
4387536,4,B004IS1URC,"I liked this movie. It's no dumber than the Twilight movies, and it's lots more fun. Jason Lockhart is actually good, despite the stupid way he has to talk, and there is real, believable chemistry between him and Christian Ferrer, even though Ferrer is not attractive and if Lockhart is gay I'm Ronald Reagan.

I don't know what all the reviewers who hated this movie expected, but I expected to hate it and ended up enjoying it a lot. And not because it's bad. To me, movies are NEVER so bad they're good; if they're bad, they're just bad. This one is amateurish and dumb, but it's also sexy and fun. I actually wanted it to be longer.",1325808000,25,636,4.389830508474576

The acting is terrible, the dialogue inane, the songs are awful.  This is sort of a David DeCoteau wannabe, but without the delicious campiness that makes some of DeCoteau's movies so much fun to watch.  ""Vampire Boys"" isn't fun to watch.  It's excruciating.",1322784000,,404,5.153846153846154

4387539,2,B004IS1URC,"Caleb is a college swimmer from the Midwest, who moves to Los Angeles, in order to be more open about his sexuality.  He meets someone online who offers to share his house with him for free, sight unseen (Yeah, unrealistic ... but get used to it!)  On his first day of classes, he encounters a clique of four mysterious guys, the ""leader"" of which, Jasin, invites him out on a date, and soon explains to him that he (and his posse') are all vampires, he's almost 100 years old, but will die on that birthday, unless he finds ""the one"" with whom he is destined to share his life and, by the way, he believes Caleb to be that person.  Would he like to become a vampire and live forever?  Have to know by tonight, 'cause, if you don't, he has a girl on standby.  Got all that?

Believe me, it doesn't seem any less crazy when you see the film, which is obviously targeting gay fans of ""Twilight"" and other vampire tales.  The plot, staging and acting are ridiculously bad, and may remind you of some of David DeCoteau's schlockfests on film.  But, unlike David's films, this one actually acknowledges some characters are gay or bisexual, and has some brief total nudity.

Actually, the ""eye candy"" is about the only thing this film has going for it, unless - like me - you happen to relish really BAD films.  ...  Two stars out of five.",1313884800,6,1333,4.378048780487805

Yes, the movie is second rate, with so-so acting, predictable plot, and not enough nudity/sex (or too much, depending on your point of view), but.... right from the first meeting of Jasin and Caleb , I found myself wanting them, willing them, to connect... passionately! The magnetism was there, but they really weren't allowed to come together, like I was hoping. I thought of other dialog lines they could... should have said (eg. when Jasin and Caleb sat down and were asking questions, to get to know each other better, I wanted Jasin to say ""I know one thing about you - you're painfully CUTE!""). I was disappointed not to see them make love (we had to be told afterwards that they'd done it). For me, the anticipation of them getting together, was enough to keep me interested, but on the whole, I decided to give it a (generous) 4 stars.",1510963200,,928,4.624242424242424
