239578,1,6300214958,"I tried to watch Delirious but found it impossible to survive the first five minutes of the most awful stand-up skit I had ever heard. I was expecting good jokes yet I suddenly realized that Eddie Murphy had the mind of a five-year-old child with an excessive tasteless appetite for crude pornography. It was bad enough to watch the audience cheering loudly every time he said a homophobic line that wasn't remotely funny. It seemed that there was no accounting for taste. Needless to say, it was shocking to see a different Eddie Murphy from what I was accustomed to in his old movies. Now, my perspective of him is completely changed although I had a less opinion of him after he was arrested for soliciting a transvestite prostitute (you don't think I forgot that, didn't you Eddie?).",1424131200,2,787,4.7101449275362315

239802,5,6300214958,"EDDIE MURPHY-DELERIOUS: Hot on the heels of his wildly successful SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE stint and a string of box office smashes like 48 HOURS and TRADING PLACES, the unforgettable cable concert DELIRIOUS cemented EDDIE MURPHY's status as the early eighties' biggest comic superstar and heir apparent to RICHARD PRYOR. In spite of a dated opening bit about sexual preferences, this is the Brooklyn born maverick at his cockiest, most aggressive, and downright funniest, sounding off about childhood (cleaned up, ICE CREAM MAN could be a BILL COSBY piece), politics and racism. MURPHY's gift for sound effects and mimicry (his sassy, irreverent sendups of JAMES BROWN, MICHAEL JACKSON and STEVIE WONDER are hilarious) make blistering routines like BARBECUE and SHOE THROWIN' MOTHERS lively treats boosted immeasurably by EDDIE's playful facial expressions and swaggering body language. A quick comparison to the much harsher theatrical release RAW loudly confirms that DELIRIOUS is the best concert EDDIE MUPRHY ever threw down and indeed one the finest comedy showcases of all time.

I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who had mentioned owning it previously and missing being able to watch it. I had, however, never seen it prior to the first viewing after we received this item. It's a great comedy show, with lots of laughter! It has a definite adult theme, so concerned parents may want to think twice about letting a child or impressionable mind watch. Also, there are racial innuendo and adult language.... But what else can you expect from such a brass, hilarious man?

240174,5,6300214958,"1983!  This was the stand up show that got Eddie Murphy in alot of trouble for his jokes on several celebrities, homosexuals, politics, and racial situations, but Eddie was skillful enough to ""tell like it was"" and at the same time embelishing some of the truth for explosive laughs.  A great comedic show is never complete without talking about his childhood and he has it down to a ""T!""  The drunken father, BBQ Family cookouts, shoe throwing mother, and ice cream man bits were priceless!  Some may get offended by the extendeded profanity Eddie uses, but he doesn't force it due to the fact that he had held back long from using the words on NBC's Saturday Night Live (if he wanted to ""keep his job"").  This was my second copy of Delirious and first professional copy period (my first copy was a DVD burned copy that I got from eBay that stopped working after a year) of which I purchased here on Amazon.  Yes, I got the 25th anniversary version with deleted scene and private interview with Eddie about the preparation of the tour.  Fire engine red leather suits and S-curls may not make a comeback, but the magic of Eddie's jokes has never left long time fans and fans of comedy overall.  I urge fans of comedy to get this and 1987's Raw is as equally as hilarious.  While you're at it, please grab a copy of his 1982 comedy album (you will get to hear his hilarious Richard Simmons and Buck Wheat parody of ""Enough is Enough"").",1321142400,2,1434,4.484615384615385

Except for the fact that I still knew every joke!

Come today.  Hey, whatever happened to that old Eddie Murphy Delirious?  Yeah, haven't watched that in years!  Oh, it's lost.  Well, maybe it's on DVD now.  Wouldn't that be cool?  A quick visit to Amazon and it is on its way to my house.  Yaaaaay!

Spent most of a Saturday folding laundry and watching this over and over again.  It's as good as it was the first time, only now I have the perspective of a 40 year old.  Same jokes, but they take on a new meaning.  Doesn't matter how many years go by.  This will always ALWAYS be my #1 favorite stand up routine of all time.

No offense to the follow up, ""RAW"".  By that time, Eddie was just cussing too much and kind of getting stuck on himself.  Which is a bummer.  Eddie was great back then, when he was still human.",1285804800,,1145,4.109090909090909

And then there's the segments including world language and the Family Cookout and the Ice Cream: that's good stuff right here! This is the classic Eddie, and I don't think we'll ever see and hear this sort of stuff from the man again sadly due to Hollywood degradation.

Don't hesitate to watch it!",1235260800,,287,4.76
240303,5,6300214958,"Originally presented on Home Box Office way back in 1983, this one-two-three career punch by Eddie Murphy was to every teenage kid of the 80's one of the most quoteable stand-up routines of their lives. To quote Murphy himself, most of us at the time only knew of Eddie as that black guy doing Buckwheat on Saturday Night Live and that funny 48HRS film. Little did we know that it was his stand-up career (started at the young age of 14) that got him there in the first place. So to see this young dynamic 22 year old performer hit us yet again with a brillant full-length comedy routine was just the amazing icing on the cake. He was our younger version of Richard Pryor the generation earlier. And HBO feed us this special throughout the 80's, again and again, and we came back each and every time.

However, after a world-changing over twenty-five years later, does the material still hold up? Absolutely. Throughout it's 70 minute runtime, Murphy spouted stories, impressions, and humor that remain timeless, be it the excitement of the Ice Cream Man, to just how fun flatulence can be, and the humors of how parents can be so similar no matter what color or area you grew up in. Sure, fashions change but can you imagine Murphy without that red ""Elvis from Hell"" suit on telling these jokes? Yes, a couple of bits like AIDS/homosexual intolerance and Michael Jackson's only quirk being his feminine-like composure seem a tad dated, but their timing and presence still remind us of what comedians are still telling to this day. There's no way you can watch this and not see comics like Chris Rock and Dave Chappell ""borrowing"" a couple of pointers straight from Delirious. And unlike his big venue concert follow-up 1987's Raw, Delirious shows Eddie at a career point where he still didn't know if people would accept him as a stand-up as well as funny actor. Raw is where he was King, Delirious shows the young man that could be.

As for it's long-overdue 2006 DVD release, it has come to the format in quite an exceptional way. Shot and presented as it first was, in 2.0 Stereo shot on FullFrame video (unlike Raw's motion picture widescreen film), it looks almost exactly as you remember almost thirty years ago off HBO. However, I happened to notice a couple of video hits here and there associated with video damage (think like videotape's version of scratches on a film print) that probably came from a bad master handed to Starz Home Entertainment. But the colors and white/black levels are spot on, no matter how bad the screen capture on the back of the case looks (it looks nothing as bad as that, thank goodness!). But those flaws are very few and will not completely distract you from what is essentially a great visual disc, though here's hoping for an even better master found for a possible Blu-Ray version in the future.

But if the entire uncut (complete with Bus Boys musical opening act) concert wasn't enough, there a total of 39 minutes of additional features! First is a four minute extended/deleted scene of the show, something of which I have never seen. About maybe twenty seconds of it ended up in the show, but now you can see what was originally around it, being a heckler of sorts wanting a live Buckwheat performance and Murphy's reaction to it (whatta think he would say, huh?). Though it's timecoded and a lost nugget, it still isn't worth putting back in, but as a bonus feature it's a great find. The other 35 minutes is a one-on-one interview with Murphy and long-time friend and interviewer Byron Allen. Recorded somewhere in the early-to-mid 2000's, both men reflect on Delirious, Eddie's early days, the then public reaction, and if Murphy ever will come back to stand-up one day. Eddie seems very open and lively during this interview, unlike many others I've seen of him recently, and Allen does get alot out of him with little coaxing. Definitely interesting watch, and Eddie tips his hat respectfully to the artists that inspired him. Two very nice additions.

Overall, it's strange to once again see the man the world once heralded as the funniest man alive in his prime again. To young fans of The Nutty Professor and Dr. Doolittle, this isn't the Eddie you currently know, but the young man that gave most of us a reason to love him in the first place.

Pros:
*Not since HBO's heyday have you seen this first Eddie Murphy
stand-up concert like this.
*90% of the jokes will still make you laugh today, no matter how
many times you've heard them.
*The extras are really great bonus features that give this release a boost that Paramount's bare-boned Raw could have used.

Cons:
*Though it looks great, the master used here could have been
from a better, remastered source.
*A couple of jokes, like Reaganomics and where AIDS come from
are dated, but again it was almost thirty years ago....
*I bet everytime Murphy sees himself again at the beginning in nothing but a Speedo, he's gotta cringe a little. Which is worse, the redsuit or that? Gotta be that. Gotta.

""Hmm, what's this?"" I wondered, and popped it in. And I was literally not the same after I watched it. I have never laughed so hard, and the lapse of more than 10 more years does not change that fact. Murphy is sharp, perceptive, goofy, brash, profane...this was the creative pinnacle of his career, box office glories aside. I saw Raw, which was also funny, but it didn't have that same edge for me. The defiling of The Honeymooners, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, James Brown...the hilarious tales from his childhood, especially his Aunt Bunny and his father at family cookouts. This routine is top-notch.

To this day, Delirious is the gold standard for me. Every stand-up routine I watch is inevitably compared to this one, although I realize I shouldn't sometimes.

240506,4,6300214958,"Most of us who were around in 1983 (I saw this during my freshman year in college at a student icebreaker) remember this. At this time, Murphy was doing a very advanced sort of high-school class clown comedy, with all the crudity one would expect from the genre. While Richard Pryor dealt with raw reality, Murphy amused with impressions and raw storytelling mixed with the profanity. Don't expect Pryor's depth here.

Much of this was shocking, but not considered that offensive at the time. The general response was ""I can't beleive he's saying this!"" But political correctness was still in the future, so the gags with the f-word for gays and of AIDS would be more controversial now than then.

But most of this is undeniably funny. The Elvis impression (We're gonna win this race), the gay Mr. T, (Hey boy, you lookin' kind of good in them jeans. MMMmmmmm!) James Brown (What the (bleep) Brother James be sayin?-presaging his turn as James Thunder Early in DREAMGIRLS), and the Honeymooners (Norton, I know and YOU know....), The ice cream man (You on the wel-fare, you can't af-ford it!) is all pretty knee-slapping, leave your brains at the door fun.

In the 25 years since it originally aired on HBO, it has been the template for just about ALL the black comedy that followed; from Def Comedy Jam to Comicview to the Kings of Comedy.  Delirious has been often quoted, often imitated, but never topped. This gloriously rude and politically incorrect show has several indelibly classic moments that became part of the conversational lexicon in the early to mid 80's. The Ice Cream Man. Mr. T as a homosexual. Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton as homosexuals. The drunken cookout rant of Eddie's father. Aunt Bunny falling down the steps. The dead-on impersonations of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Elvis.  The gleefully rude evisceration of social and sexual taboos.

Forget the fat suits, the big dresses and the 10 minute long fart joke scenes. Along with his Academy Award nominated DREAMGIRLS role and his luminous[possibly series saving] Saturday Night Live characters, DELIRIOUS will be the work that future generations of comedy connoisseurs will cite as evidence of Eddie Murphy's career-spanning genius.

Unlike most of his movie catalog as an actor and character voice, DELIRIOUS is an uproarious and dizzyingly bravura performance in which Murphy distills his youthful Brooklyn vigor, channeling it via Bill Cosby's story-telling and filtering it through Redd Foxx's calculated vocabulary- creating an incandescent experience that could make you forget PLUTO NASH.",1173484800,,801,5.779661016949152

Okay, so some of you are thinking, ""I already have the VHS.  Why should I buy the DVD?""  I shouldn't have to tell you that the quality is much better but even more, the DVD has an interview of Murphy conducted by Byron Allen.  The interview alone is worth the purchase.

I wish Eddie Murphy would return to the stand up circuit and bring his trademark style and wit to a modern day audience. Twenty years of history would be an avalanche of material for a great show.

I disagree wholeheartedly with some of the other reviewers who have reviewed it since its DVD release date of 2/6/07.  There are a few extras and they are interesting (including outtakes from the original concert and a more recent interview with Murphy); the material on ""Delirious"" is so strong, though, that no extras are needed.  I firmly believe that barring early Cosby, this may be the greatest stand-up performance on film (and that includes Richard Pryor!).  It's hard to believe Murphy is only 22 years old at the taping of this concert!  He seems like a seasoned veteran of 20 or 30 years.  Briefly, the ""Honeymooners"" and ""Elvis"" bits will have you rolling on the floor and the family cookout monologue is a classic.  Buy this DVD and pass it on to your children.

240711,3,6300214958,"Here's a review from someone who has actually watched the Delirious DVD:

I got my hands on a VHS copy of this at an early age and watched it to the point of memorization for years afterwards.  I immediately pre-ordered the DVD upon seeing that it was going to be released, excited to have a permanent copy of something that of which I had fond memories.

The DVD is a little disappointing.  It looks like someone put their VHS copy in a dual deck and recorded a DVD from it.  There are very few extras.  The sound doesn't seem to have been touched up much.  There are no subtitles (I still don't know what the lady says near the end that makes Eddie crack up).  The colors seems to fade in and out the way they would on a worn-out VHS tape.

But, if you remember the special and want to have a permanent copy (at least until DVD's are outdated), then I'd recommend getting it.  If you remember all the jokes as well as I do, then it's not going to make you laugh that much, but it's good to add to your collection.",1171411200,2,1015,4.158974358974359
240712,5,6300214958,"I watched this DVD and noticed something: as I was watching it, I knew 90% of it even though I haven't seen it in at least 15 years.  Thats how funny I thought this was/is.  I saw every punchline coming and I laughed outloud at every one of them like it was the first time I was hearing it.  I was 13yo when this was shown on HBO and I remember people talking about it and imitating parts of it and it still goes on TODAY... I mean, look at the title of the reviews on here. lol.  The brand new 34 minute interview didn't go in depth as I thought it would or should but it was still nice to hear Eddie's thoughts on something he did nearly 24 years ago when he was barely out of his teens(and his red leather outfit didn't match? Nobody would've known that if Eddie didn't say it in the interview).  I often wondered why it took so long for it to come out on DVD.  I wonder if it was because of the politically incorrect tirades on gays and the new(at the time) AIDS epidemic saying things like 'girls kiss a gay guy and go home with aids on their lips', etc... Did Murphy not want it released? Who knows what the reason is because it's out now and we can all laugh at something we watched when we were all(most likely) teenagers watching a new channel called HBO and laughing at how foul mouthed and funny Eddie was.  Delirous is way ahead of Raw, his 1987 standup, because Raw seemed to be a bit angry.  It's still funny but the two videos are so different in tone that, at least for me, I tend to gravitate towards the more fun of the two.  If you grew up watching Delirious than it's pretty obvious you need to buy this as soon as possible.  Worth every penny.  ""Goony Goo Goo, Gus""",1171238400,4,1686,4.109756097560975

Much to my disappointment after receiving this DVD, it is not subtitled and has no captions.  What is the point?  What year are we living in?  Is it really that hard, after going through all of the trouble of putting an older film on DVD to subtitle or caption it?

I can remember this routine from when I was a kid and sneaking up to watch it on HBO and just laughing my tail off.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.

240716,5,6300214958,"All I can say is that IT'S ABOUT TIME that this comedy classic is released on DVD. Eddie Murphy has never been funnier than he is on display here in Delirious.

Sure, some of the jokes might not make sense to kids today who didn't grow up in the early 80's, but the majority of the humor is universal and has aged well, particularly when he talks about growing up with his eccentric relatives/family members.

While his 1987 standup film Raw, isn't quite as good, now that Delirious has been released on DVD there's no reason to not pick up both of them at the same time.  Talk about a hilarious double bill!

The 40 minute present day interview with Eddie is an excellent extra talking about the importance of this standup special originally broadcast on HBO in 1983.  While he had had a very successful movie in the form of 48 Hrs. and a successful run on SNL, he hadn't truly exploded into a superstar until 1984's Beverly Hills Cop set the box office on fire.  So, Delirious manages to catch a comedian at the apex of his comedy talent.

240769,5,6300214958,"I rented Eddie Murphy's DVD of ""Raw"" just last year.  I was thinking:  ""Maybe they released this one first because everyone thinks it's better.""  But, I feel: ""No way!  ""Delirious"" is a hundred times funnier!""  On ""Raw"", Eddie sounded a little more mean-spirited, especially about women. On his performance on ""Raw"", just seemed like he had some indirect points to make regarding his own problems involving a particular woman recently in his life. You can see and hear some sincere bitterness in that performance.  And it seems like he was trying to talk to the guys of the audince and convince them to see things his way about women.  Even though I'm a guy, I was uncomfortable watching and listening to Eddie on that performance.

However, ""Delirious"" is the performance that made him a star. The humor on ""Delirious"" was far more variable too. He did more celebrity impressions and even created exaggerated performances of his own family. He took the subjects of humor that Bill Cosby probably would do, but Eddie Murphy made it far more nastier.

Even Bill Cosby's 1982 performance on DVD called ""Bill Cosby Himself"", is a great DVD to have also for a night of comedy to share when your friends are over.  And Cosby's performance is generally quite clean. And, to me, if you can be hilarious as hell, and get people rolling on the floor laughing, without having to be vulgar in any way, this is what makes a comedian great. However, Eddie is just the opposite of Bill Cosby. But, Eddie does have a lot more talent than the average black comedian.  His timing is in check, his effective use of dramatic pause, and his gift of accurate celebrity impersonations is what made this whole show so great.  He was just as good, if not better than Rich Little.  I've always thought that people who have to use fowl language to express themselves is usually a sign of someone trying, very loudly, to cover up their ignorance. Black and white people both do this when they want to make a point. But, I guess it's routine for black comedians to depend on it more than white comedians.  Eddie sure cleaned up his act over the years though, hasn't he?  Just like Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong), they were once vulgar comedians, and now they both do voices for Disney cartoons.

I sure hope they don't alter this DVD for the sake of ""political correctness"".  Back in the day, I remember when this show was first released on an album called ""Eddie Murphy: Comedian"".  I wanted to buy it so bad.  Today's kids have no idea what it`s like to struggle to put some money together just to buy an album that you wanted so badly. Back then, we respected our vinyl LP's like they were as cherishable as a piece of fine jewelry. We worked so hard just to buy one new album! I never thought that my parents owed me anything, so if I wanted to buy a record, I had to go out and make my own money.  It's just that simple, and it makes good sense.  I went out and cut people's grass, raked leaves, shoveled snow, washed cars, and did whatever it took just to get a few bucks together to buy that one new album that I just had to have.  I appreciated it more because I know I worked it.  Today's kids have no idea how spoiled they are, and yet they still complain that they don't have enough. They think thier parents owe then something for being alive.  And they measure themselves (and their ""bling"" stock) against their other friends who may possibly have more than them and they try to make us parents feel guilty about it.  Of course, they never tell us about the kid's they know who have so much less than them.

I hope they can give their own kids ""half"" of what we gave them growing up. They are going to be in for a shock!!  I know I drifted off the point here about this review, but I just remember fondly of how I applied myself to the working world as a kid to have the nicer things that my friends didn't have because they were too lazy to go out and work for anything.  Buying the album of this Eddie Murphy show is an example of what I went through just because I wanted it.  I just wanted to share that with you.",1170547200,,4106,4.394179894179894

241119,4,6300214958,"Normally I dislike comedy that is oriented toward vulgarity, because vulgarity's only purpose in comedy is shock value and it wears off after a while.  And Eddie Murphy's comedy routine in Delirious is as vulgar as anything ever put to record or videotape.  Yet Murphy is at the same time as funny as any comedian ever heard to that point.
Murphy circa-1983 is proudly offensive, skewering his subjects with hilarious venom.  Today people will cringe at his blatant homophobia, ignoring that his comedy nails down the patent absurdity involved in homosexuality.  Murphy also nails other subjects, one of which is strikingly relevent circa 2003 - Murphy skewers pop singer Michael Jackson and elements of his female fandom, and seen today it graphically reminds the viewer just what Michael Jackson truly is.  The amazing part is Murphy's lampoon is done with a completely straight face, even as the packed house overwhelms the sound system as the audience dies laughing and screaming as Murphy skewer's Jackson's song ""She's Out Of My Life""; that Murphy can maintain his comedic composure through all this is a sign of a true pro.
He gets what amounts to a standing ovation repeatedly throughout the performance, notably during the Michael Jackson lampoon and also when he imitates Elvis Presley, capturing Presley's posture before his death; the sight of Murphy walking as circa-1970s Elvis is worth the price of admission by itself.
Then there is the epic of the mother who uses a shoe to strike her unruly children, told as played by Clint Eastwood - ""Why'd you eat the ice cream off the floor?"" after Murphy whistles the ""Fistful of Dollars"" theme once again brings the house down, and it happens again in the funniest part of the subject - the mother and father preparing to go out one night, but the mother hears (via Murphy's dead-on imitation of the Six Million Dollar Man scanning sound effect) her unruly children and their friends on bunkbeds and a high heel shoe becomes the perfect boomerang.
Offensive, yes, and proudly so, and in these times of intellectual ossification known as political correctness such offensiveness can actually be a necessity.",1069977600,8,2164,5.0

241122,5,6300214958,"Aside from pretty much any'a Richard Pryor's classic stand-up material, this is the BEST an' FUNNIEST stand-up show I've ever seen. I used 'ta see it on HBO all the time in the '80s, but I ain't actually sit down an' watch it thoroughly 'til 'bout 1989 when I was nine years old, an' ever since is' been essential to me, an' one'a the only stand-up shows that never ceases to make me laugh, no matter how many damn times I watch it. Be warned that it is not for the faint of ear an' some portion of it is bound to offend jus' 'bout ANYBODY out there. This brought the raw an' groundbreaking comedy of Redd Foxx an' Pryor to a whole 'nother plateau of obscenity an' political incorrectness, an' made Eddie Murphy prob'ly the most controversial name in comedy at the time. His dead-on impressions an' musings on what it would be like if the Honeymooners were gay, Michael Jackson's femininity, Elvis' drugged-out an' bloated later years, an' James Brown's incomprehensible speech are jus' CLASSIC stuff. Then there's his thoughts on the ""trappings"" of his newfound celebrity (""Women be throwin' it to me on the street like frisbees. HERE! *whoooosh* Thank you! 'Preciate that!""), the rise of black politicians, an' his hilarious tale 'bout his trip to Texas in search of racism which cracks me up every time I jus' THINK 'bout it (if y'all ever see me in a long line at the airport by myself waitin' to get my bags checked an' I jus' bust out laughing, 'ya know what I'm thinkin' 'bout). Of course I couldn't leave without mentionin' his father's drunken tirade against Uncle Gus an' Bigfoot Aunt Bunny at the family cook-out. Thas' some priceless material.
This is Eddie's BEST stand-up by all means, an' well eclipses 'Raw', which even I'll admit he went a lil' over-the-top on.  Everytime I think 'bout the people who criticize Eddie's stand-up for bein' too abrasive an' immoral, it jus' makes me sad that people can't jus' have a sense'a humor 'bout any an' e'ything. 'Ay, ya'know what? Maybe it was Y'ALL who drove Eddie to do the lame family comedies he's doin' nowadays! Well, least thas' what I wanna believe.
But, look, fa'real now. E'ybody lighten up. As crass an' incredibly offensive as 'Delirious' is, if you'll jus' leave all your beliefs an' convictions at the door, you'll find how surprisingly easy to listen to an' enjoyable it is, because Eddie is one'a the loosest, most comfortable an' charismatic comedic performers EVER. He was BORN to be a star. I can't believe this man was 22 years old when this was filmed, the same age I am right now, an' yet was already an established comedian an' well on his way to bein' a Hollywood superstar. Meanwhile I'M goin' to pick up my unemployment check tomorrow. Man, thas' depressin'. I think I'm'a go watch this right now an' cheer myself up.",1050105600,8,2802,4.66060606060606

YOU LOOK MIGHTY CUTE IN THEM JEANS! - every once in a while I come across someone who has seen it and it's almost like we belong to a secret club. Sometimes I laugh out loud even if I'm just thinking about it, especially if I'm thinking about the sketches about the ice cream man and the family picnic. I recommend this to EVERYONE. If I could rate this higher I would. I join other reviewers in wishing there was a wider availability, but you can find it somewhere. Watch it and join the club.",1048896000,30,760,4.073333333333333
241124,5,6300214958,"If you thought Eddie Murphy was funny in SNL, you'll love ""Delirious"". This is without a doubt the funniest stand up I've ever seen. Murphy is at his best here, and has never been as good in anything else since.
  My favorite moments are his impersonations of Mr. T, and the James Brown bit still makes me cry every time I watch it.
  It is politically incorrect and may be found offensive by anyone and everyone, regardless of race, sexual orientation, or geographical origin, and that's why it's so funny.
  If you ever get the chance to watch this, don't miss it!",1048204800,,566,4.5

241166,5,6300214958,"I've seen a lot of stand up comedy, both older and modern, but nothing can ever top Eddie Murphy's comedic genius in 1983's Delirious. His impressions of such celebrities like Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, James Brown, Mr. T and Elvis are priceless. He tells the story of his life so clearly and with such enthusiasm, I'm almost sent there back to his childhood having a cookout with his dysfunctional family, and his rather... well... curious 'adventures'in his bathtub.
This is such a great example of cutting-edgecomedy at its finest, and it should be re-released. Every time I see it, I still laugh so hard that tears uncontrollably come out of my eyes. Many others might have come close to Murphy's unconvential humor, but no one topped his high caliber performance in Delirious.",1045353600,6,786,4.962121212121212
241167,5,6300214958,"That's a line from this stand-up act, when Eddie described a person who tries to recite one of his jokes but messes it up. So I won't try to do that, okay? Now, although ""Raw"" is my favorite one, ""Delirious"" is a completely flawless stand-up act from Ed. His impressions of Clint Eastwood and Mr. T are very funny, and I loved his portrayal of his mom with the ""boomerang"" shoe. The most outrageous moments came when he described his dysfunctional family barbecue and the joy of hearing the ice cream truck coming as a kid. Not only is Ed's delivery good and his jokes hilarious, but he even has fun with the audience as he borrows a member's camera to take pictures of the theatre. That shows that he has good showmanship. Get this film now, and while you're at it, get ""Raw"" also. Both are hard to find, this one being the hardest.",1044921600,2,833,4.380645161290323

But when I saw Delirious (and later, Raw) a few years agoI absolutely adored Murphy as my favorite comedian.  I have seen both videos well over a dozen times each.  The jokes never get old and I never keep laughing.  If you're someone who likes immature jokes and good impersonations along with tons of vulgarity this is a must have.  I recommend it to everyone that has a sense of humor.",1039564800,,506,4.273684210526316

have cable television.  I only listened to Delirious on 33-inch

laughs.  ""Spectre Vision"" delivered the tape about a week after
I ordered.  Tape was in good condition and shipped in a secure
plastic VHS case.  Would do business with Spectre again.",1037923200,3,371,4.825396825396825

But still, I remember some of the finer moments...Well, if you seriously need to chill out because of test nerves, or just really need a laugh, then you should see Delirious, I'm positive that you won't regret it.",1037750400,,546,4.259615384615385
241174,5,6300214958,"Eddie Murphy's 1983 stand-up special Delirious is from beginning to end pure chaos. Not only are the jokes extremely funny, a lot of them are fall-out-of-your-seat funny (my favorite parts are when he talks about slavery and male singers). All the jokes are still funny now, which means they aged well. And when you look at the audience shots, you'll notice there are all different races of people there, which is good; and it's probably because whereas now many black comedians talk about how black people are different from white people, Eddie says things that are relatable to all races, all ages, male or female.
The only thing that bothers me is that this video is out of print, and I don't remember it ever coming on cable. So if you want to see it, you'll have to either shell out for an import (if you can even find THAT) or rent it. But you'll enjoy every minute of it.",1036454400,5,878,4.49375

Still funny, but nowhere near as funny as delirious!  to anyone who hasn't seen this, including my wife, you are at a great loss.
