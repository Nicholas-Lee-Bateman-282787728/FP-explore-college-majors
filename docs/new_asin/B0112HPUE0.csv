7322030,4,B0112HPUE0,"This move was a pleasant surprise. I am a big fan of the show Psych and it's star, James Roday, who wrote and directed this film. I liked the few horror episodes from that show and decided to give this movie a shot, and I was not disappointed.

It has a lot of the same feel as episodes of Psych, completely ridiculous characters and some well placed cultural references. It's completely crazy from start to finish and I was never bored. It has a low-budget campy feel, like Evil Dead II.

Overall, I would say my experience with this movie was better than I had anticipated and I recommend it to other Psych fans.",1444176000,8,614,4.37719298245614
7322031,3,B0112HPUE0,"I wanted to like this but I didn't. I think I was suppose to laugh but I didn't. I was hoping to have a fun time watching this but I didn't. I can use another bad dumb line about this film but I won't. I did like the soundtrack and score though. The spirit of Gravy is fantastic and I get where the crew was trying to come from but it was executed poorly. They did what they could with the material but the writing just wasn't good. No gore and all bore and snore. Off camera and blood squirts are just so low budget. Spend some money on showing the kills and I would have had a lot more interest in this horredy.

Watch it an see hilarious dialogue from Michael Weston who plays Anson, a Charlie Day clone and Sutton Foster who plays Kerry.

Anson: ""You lied to me!""
Kerry: ""Yeah I'm not really attracted to dickless cannibals.""
Anson: ""That's not true I have a dick.""

And that's the funniest line in the whole movie. Movies are so easy to make. But so hard to make good. I'm so thankful I get to ride the gravy train and just critique them. But as a fan I wouldn't and can't recommend other movie geeks invest their time in Gravy.",1444089600,4,1133,4.140909090909091
7322032,5,B0112HPUE0,"Best horror movie I've ever seen. It is a ""horrific comedy"", so make no mistake that this movie ultimately boils down to a dark comedy. Usually such a genre is a recipe for failure, but in this case it works. Perhaps that makes all the difference for me because I dig this movie like I never thought I could something so dark. The cast knocks it out of the park, and I can watch it many times and love it every time. It is great.",1444089600,3,429,4.0588235294117645

7322083,5,B0112HPUE0,"This movie is hilarious. As an avid Psych fan I always want something more from this series. And in classic James Today fashion he delivers it in this comedy horror hybrid. The mnage of an array of classic horror films and actors really seals the deal on this film, and one cannot underemphasize the music of this film.",1461369600,,319,4.517241379310345

7322085,5,B0112HPUE0,"While this movie isn't for everyone, the shot composition, score, impeccable practical effects are all tonally consistent (a difficult feat in a horror comedy, which has an inherent dualing nature), and it is never dull (a watchable movie if it were only for this alone). Every camera pan and tiny eater egg has purpose. For example the camera movement from character to character becomes faster and less measured as the pacing of the movie is ramped up - and although frenetic, the pacing is wholy consistent with the on screen action while still communicating all of the necessary information from scene to scene. As for Easter eggs...

[SLIIGHT... SPOILER ALERT]check out the placing of the coaster on the head of our woefully inept, and recently rejected musician when he is talking to Sutton Foster's character... Then look at where he is bleeding from at movies ends after falling to his death while talking with Sutton's character... Yup... Repeat viewings may show some significance to the design of the coaster - but that is a lot to process during my first viewing. Like I said, a lot of thought went into this.

It is also worth noting what this movie has going for it in spades. It is bold and wholely original. Roday's direction is sure, making many scenes that shouldn't be funny or horrifying - both - by letting his well cast actors flex there comedic chops, while not shying away from visually arresting, and gory contrasts a la Greg Nicotero (of Walking Dead and Day of the Dead fame) nor does it shy away from making THAT joke - that one you can't believe that friend who always goes there said. And even the parts of the movie that it may be criticized for, are far from boring (the cardinal cinematic sin). This movie is packed with a lot unique content (arguably too much) and has something of a niche appeal. The reason I give this movie 5 stars is because I can see this becoming something of a cult classic to those of us who fall into said niche - it provides us that oddball horror/comedy sensibility we are looking for (and honestly, I hope it does become a cult classic, Roday seems a very talented fellow). But for those of you this isn't for... You have been warned...",1458259200,,2199,4.621483375959079
7322086,5,B0112HPUE0,"Incredible movie. Think.. Always Sunny meets... Funny Games...? its an amazing horror comedy with a great cast, but most importantly its rewatchable and enjoyable over and over. amazing replay value, only wish it came with a digital copy. thats the only downfall. either way this movie is great, and if you're a fan of anyone in the cast, horror comedy... get it.",1457568000,,363,4.870967741935484

7322088,5,B0112HPUE0,Horror comedies can be a total hit or miss but Gravy is one of those movies that hits the mark with laugh out loud moments while still giving you the gore all horror movie fans love. I bought this movie as a recommendation from Amazon Amazon based on my last purchases and I'd have to say good job Amazon for letting me know about this gem. The cast is amazing and the story is great. Definitely a movie I'd use to introduce some of my skeptical friends into loving horror movies by giving them the blood yet a lot of laughs to keep them interested. Worth every penny to add this to my horror movie collection.,1456704000,,610,4.267241379310345
7322089,4,B0112HPUE0,Gravy is a fun horror comedy. It kept me entertained the entire time. I have to say James Roday impersonating Charlie Day the entire time was pretty freaking odd but I guess it added to the madness.,1455926400,,198,4.378378378378378
7322090,4,B0112HPUE0,"Bought this for a huge Psych fan who thoroughly enjoyed. Here's the thing about this movie: it is definitely psych style banter and comedy in a horror setting. If you go into it expecting to chuckle and enjoy, you will.
If you're looking for an Oscar worthy performance, probably not going to happen here.
Side note: while it is ridiculous and unrealistic, it's hilarious. Give it a shot.",1455753600,6,388,4.720588235294118

7322122,5,B0112HPUE0,"This is a horror cult comedy and is not for everyone. Anson (rhymes with Manson), his brother Stef (Jimmi Simpson) and Stef's sadistic GF Mimi (Lily Cole) take a restaurant crew prisoner and plan to eat them. The six victims are tied to chairs while a wildcard is forgotten and unattended to. Stef tells them they plan a ""pseudo European gangster style slumber party.""

The brothers are terribly likable with funny lines. We get to know the victims and they are all great characters, especially Gabourey Sidibe. The Mexican food place has a French chef (Lothaire Bluteau) whose insults are ""surprisingly colorful.'

The film uses ""Night Court"" and other obscure references that even the cast didn't understand. (I watched the commentary, which I normally don't.) Sarah Silverman had a minor part and only filmed for a day. I would recommend avoiding trailers as they show people dying which may be a plot spoiler for some. DVD cover is not a spoiler for a change.  Great rock sound track. Katrina and the New Waves never sounded so good.

8723513,3,B0112HPUE0,"Wouldn't say it's laugh a minute, but still fun to watch. The most fun comes from watching the three villains. Jimmi Simpson brings that weirdness you may love if you have watched him on Psych, or It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Michael Weston, another Psych veteran, brings those sad puppy dog eyes that make him likeable, even when he's a psychopathic cannibalistic killer. And Lily Cole is so hot and so weird at the same time. James Roday and Dule Hill appear towards the end in what amounts to cameo performances. Their presence isn't really essential to the plot. It probably has more to do with James Roday exercising his prerogatives as director. Be warned, comedy or not, there are scenes of blood and guts that will make you cringe.",1489881600,,745,4.7384615384615385
