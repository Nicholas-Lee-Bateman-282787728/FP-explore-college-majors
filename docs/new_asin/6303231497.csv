7841165,5,6303231497,"I am giving a 5 star rating to the producers of this video and the entire Blue Angels crew.  It is the best in depth production of the Blue Angels I have ever seen.  I have seen other documentaries, but, they don't compare to this one.  I originally saw this on TV many years ago and I was happy to find this tape.  Just wish it was available on DVD as I don't know how much longer my vhs player will last.",1344556800,,406,3.9146341463414633
7841166,5,6303231497,"If you had never considered that angels might be real, you will now.  This is the most realistic movie about angels that I've ever seen.  It has several reputable people with firsthand knowledge of angels sharing their stories.  I'm sure it sounds played and corny, but in 1994 I read Dannion Brinkley's Saved By The Light and it forever changed my life.  Since that time, I have read his other two books and seem him interviewed on other films, and still find him credible to this day.  I consider Dannion's testimony the highlight of the film.

When I was eight years old or so, I remember my mom's friend relating a story to us about when she was a girl praying alone in her dark room and how a hand touched her shoulder.  She said that it didn't scare her and that she felt comforted.  For some reason I never doubted the validity to her story.  Since then, I have had a few angelic encounters of my own, so I know that these things can occur.  Anyways, this is an excellent documentary, and would make a great followup to watching It's A Wonderful Life on Christmas Day.",1259107200,,1075,4.411167512690355
7841167,5,6303231497,Quite possibly the best Blue Angels documentary out there.  Does a great job showing how hard all the pilots and support crew work behind the scenes to get every show in the air.  This will definitely leave you with a much better appreciation of exactly what goes on during an air show.,1175126400,,286,4.480769230769231
7841168,5,6303231497,"What realy makes this documentary is the Blues team for that year. Some of the greatest pilots with the humblest and greatest attitudes. On top of that the whole Blues program is an outstanding display of real concern for safety and a formidable example of team work. I love planes, but these guys made this real special. I was so impressed with them that I bought lunch and showed it to my leadership staff at work.",1174089600,,416,4.4868421052631575
7841169,5,6303231497,"After seeing this video, I came to realize how important communication is. When you are flying within 36 inches of each other, it is a must. I also saw how much saying I was wrong and I will do better the next time is  critical to staying alive. These men are men of excellence and the flying  was awesome and the oneness exhibited was awe inspiring.",953078400,2,350,4.287878787878788
7841170,5,6303231497,"My 2 year-old and I have watched this together at least 100 times, and we love it.  I'm a pilot; he loves airplanes.  As a former coxswain on the US Rowing Team, I was struck how much the emphasis on teamwork and the  training routines had in common with the rowing community.  Watching this  video made me want to give it to friends training for the 2000 Olympics, it  reminds me so much of them.  I recommended it to coworkers.  The video and  its world tour captures the optimistic feeling of universal brotherhood  that reigned immediately following the end of the Cold War.  You'll tap  your feet to the music.  The flying sequences are beautiful.  You come away  from this with boundless admiration for the pilots, the maintenance crews,  the families, the airplanes and the whole program.  For anyone associated  with naval aviation especially, this video would be an endless daydream of  heaven.",945129600,17,903,4.784313725490196
7841171,5,6303231497,This video does an outstanding job of showing you what it is like to BE a Blue Angel - whether you are a Blue Angel pilot or ground crew.  It is a must see for anyone interested in military demonstration teams.,923616000,3,210,4.121951219512195
7841172,5,6303231497,This video really shows what the team is all about.  The historical show season this video covers includes their European tour in which they demo in former Warsaw pact nations including a show in Moscow.  You will enjoy this  video.,914198400,,232,4.75
