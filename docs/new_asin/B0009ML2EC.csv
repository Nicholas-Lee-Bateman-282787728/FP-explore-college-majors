She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Inuyasha's gang comes across a man who knows of a plot that is very dangerous. A group of demons is making fake jewels. They are strong, but unstable. They soon find out that the man who played a victim is actually a half demon, and also the one behind the experiments.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1415,4.335849056603774

However, I hate the fact that these DVDs which contain ONLY 3 episodes are sold for $20 and (if you go to some foreign Jap/China town in the US) they sell for $30!! I mean, three episodes? Rip off! In my opinion, one episode is worth $1. Plus, the extras in these DVDs aren't even all that great either!

Back in the early 2000's, company's like Pioneer/Geneon Entertainment sell one Sailor Moon DVD for $14.99 and they contain 6-7 episodes! Boo to ViZ. At least put 6 episodes in a DVD if you're going to sell your products at ridiculously high prices...but I guess its too late for that. I wonder if they're going to release the Final Act series... Also...why doesn't ViZ sub the opening and ending songs?! LAZYYYY!!",1305590400,2,805,4.476190476190476
