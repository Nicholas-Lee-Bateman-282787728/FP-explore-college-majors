8591412,2,B00DBPBPWS,No as good as Volume 1. The characters voices are different and the story lines are not as good. My students enjoyed Vol. 1 but did not care for Vol 2.,1454112000,,151,3.903225806451613
8591413,2,B00DBPBPWS,"I read in the other reviews that Volume 2 is different and it's true. No Warren Buffet, just a bad imitation of his voice. No stars to beef up the episodes' ""cool"" factor. It's just ok. My kids prefer the Volume 1.",1400198400,,214,4.119047619047619
8591414,5,B00DBPBPWS,Wonderful baseline to develop kids understanding of finance.  The storyline is easy to follow and the kids enjoy watching it.  I have kids in the 3-7 years old range and they love watching the show (even asking to watch it again and again).,1398038400,,240,4.558139534883721
8591415,4,B00DBPBPWS,"My 5 and 9 year old loved the first season and love this one. We were a little put-off by the fact that Warren Buffet has been replaced (in the show) by another voice-actor who obviously is NOT Buffet. And the kid Radley has been replaced by another voice actor as well.
I thought the episodes were a little more campy and unrealistic compared to the first season. Felt a little like jumping the shark. And no cameos, whereas Shaq, JayZ, and Nic Canon appear in the 1st season. But still very good lessons on financial intelligence, marketing, and business. Where else will you find a financial program your kids will remember and want to watch over and over? Grab both seasons!",1385683200,4,678,4.565573770491803
8591416,5,B00DBPBPWS,The Secret Millionaire Club is a great series about kids learning how to respect and make money for themselves at a young age.  The cartoon series is also very entertaining and educational.,1379116800,,189,4.90625
