7926579,5,B00004Y6BR,"This film has it all; a killer orchestral musical score by Nico Fidenco, beautiful photography by Aristide Massacessi (D'Amato's real name), good editing by Fulci regular Vincenzo Tomassi, and plenty of violence, sex, gore, and perversion to fill anyone's quota.  Laura Gemser is in top form as the photographer Emanuelle working for Amnesty International who uncovers a snuff film ring much like in ""8mm"".  Of course the plot isn't at all that simple with Gemser having numerous sexual experiences with a wide variety of characters from Lorraine De Selle to Gabriele Tinti (her real life husband).
There's some hard-core scenes thrown in every now and then as well, but Gemser is never present during them.  In one particularly silly sequence, she goes from hut to hut, peering inside to watch stock footage of native having hard-core sex inside!  There's also that famous ""horse sequence"" which I won't even begin to describe further, and some rather shocking sequences involving women being violated by hooks and torture equipment.  None of this as real, although the FX man Giannetto De Rossi was taken to court to prove that the violence in the film was indeed faked.  It sure caught me off-guard however, and I'm used to this sort of film.
Anyway, buy this DVD and be ready for one of the most hallucenagenic rides of your life.  Watching this film is like entering a strange fantasy world where all the laws of human social behaivior suddenly cease to apply.  D'Amato's best!",974419200,35,1482,4.94758064516129
