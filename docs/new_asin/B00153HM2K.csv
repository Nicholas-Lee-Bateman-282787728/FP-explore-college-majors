8257252,5,B00153HM2K,I used this to help teach my 7 yr. old daughter about magnetism for her science project.  Her science project got a ribbon so she had to present it to the class.  Her teacher also played the DVD for the class.  Everyone enjoyed the presentation and DVD.,1247011200,,253,4.340425531914893

I was REALLY disappointed with this dvd and found it not to be worth the money for the very basic 15 minutes of information it contains becasue you can obtain the info on the internet or youtube for free. I feel like I lost all of my money on this purchase. I feel this is a $10 dollar dvd at best brand new with shipping included.",1239408000,3,503,5.706666666666667
