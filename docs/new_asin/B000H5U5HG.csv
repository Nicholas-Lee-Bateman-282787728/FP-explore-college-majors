There are some very genuine funny moments throughout, as well as many parts that make you feel for the comics. I think this movie also shows how in stand up comedy, how long you have been around can get you better spots on shows than just being funny. This is shown well during the Montreal Comedy Festival scene.

As of writing this review I don't think any of them have become the ""next big thing"", but it is very interesting being able to search for them on the internet to see where there careers are now.

All in all I found this movie to be very very in depth look into the *harsh* world of stand up comedy.",1260921600,2,699,4.208955223880597
