8678856,5,B00NLJJHOM,When I was studying graphic design in college there was no graphic design history textbook. Watching this film has filled in a lot of information gaps. A design revolution was happening in the United States when I was both an undergrad and a grad student.  And after that the computer revolution in graphic design. This film has put a lot of things in context.,1447372800,3,360,4.625
8678857,3,B00NLJJHOM,"Charming and famous, these rule-bound, unimaginative, formulaic designers (I know, I'm just as repetitive as they are) baffle me with their success. A coffee cup that spills coffee? A map that you have to call a diagram because it doesn't work? This is good design? Please. And what's with Lella chuckling after every single statement? This is the trademark of disingenuousness, hiding who you really are. Can't wait to give this film away.",1420243200,3,440,5.041095890410959
8678858,5,B00NLJJHOM,"As 2014 ended, the New York Times devoted an entire page to remembering Massimo Vignelli, the designer who was born in 1931 and died in May 2014. You may not know his name, but you've seen his work a million times in countless forms.

In a dozen photos and a brief profile of Vignelli, The Times explained how this one Italian-American immigrant and his wife Lella shaped contemporary America, calling him ""a modern-design missionary. His signature simplicity cut away the clutter found in much commercial design.""

That's why the release of Design is One: Lella & Massimo Vignelli by documentary filmmakers Kathy Brew and Roberto Guera is such an eye-opening experience. Close your eyes for a moment and envision the ""look"" of American Airlines, Ford, IBM, Xerox, Gillette, JCPenney, Bloomingdales and Saks. Chances are your mind's eye holds snapshots of Vignelli logos, products, signs, shopping bags and more. You've already got image after image of the Vignellis' work stored away; seeing this film will unlock new insights into how these images connect.

This film is a terrific discussion-starter for small groups. You'll find a host of associations with themes of faith and the goal of building healthy, diverse communities. In the film, the Vignellis say that their proudest accomplishment is the design of St. Peter's Church in New York City, where they both planned to be interred and, of course, Massimo arrived in 2014.

As we tour this church in the film, Massimo points to the St. Peter's columbarium and says, ""That's our permanent residence. It makes me so happy to know that we will be here forever."" If you discuss this film with friends, you'll have an evening of spirited conversation on that scene, alone.

And, as the filmmakers show us in the course of the documentary, the Vignellis were interfaith pioneers, also designing a number of gorgeous pieces for Jewish families, especially focusing on silver candleholders in various forms.

Stepping back from the specifically religious content of the film, the Vignellis spare modernist approach to design had the overall mission of encouraging healthy communities by bringing greater clarity to the treasures that can unite us as a body of diverse people. One of Massimo Vignelli's most enduring projects was a redesign of the ""look"" of our National Parks.

Even the National Parks Conservation Association says that the graphical ""look"" of National Parks publications and maps was ""an idiosyncratic hodgepodge"" before Vignelli arrived in 1977 with the goal of popping Americans' eyes open to the wonders awaiting us in our parks. Because of federal-government bureaucracy before that time, National Parks publications were printed in black and white in a crazy quilt of designs. Vignelli (with support from National Parks publications chief Vincent Gleason) designed maps and brochures and paperback books that featured gorgeous color photographs, simplified maps and a standardized design that welcomed visitors to any of the hundreds of nationally administered parks.

In the film, we hear Lella and Massimo repeatedly explain that their lives were dedicated to helping millions of Americans understand our country in clear and inviting ways. From home furnishings to subway maps, from chairs to books, from jewelry to magazines, from watches to calendarsthis couple's hands made our world more hospitable. As they accomplished their goal through a remarkably long career, they made America a more welcoming place for the growing diversity of our people.",1420156800,5,3528,5.276292335115865
8678859,5,B00NLJJHOM,"Before watching this 79 minute 2013 documentary on the husband/wife design team Massimo and Lella Vignelli, another fine DVD in the arts and design series from First Run Features, I had never heard of them. But once I film started I knew their work  just not their name. Think of the design of the New York Subway map or the connecting os in Bloomingdales logo or Americana Airlines logo. These are designs from the couple. When you choose Helvetia as a font on your PC you can thank them too. (It started to be used in Switzerland but it was Massimo who brought it to the US.  While Massimo is more involved in graphic design, his wife makes jewelry and together they design cookware and cutlery. And a church  Saint Peters in New York.

There are lots of comments from design experts  mostly new to me  and in a few cases the terminology was a bit confusing but the story quickly got interesting. I now app4reciate their work more than ever,

The DVD contains two bonuses: First is In Memoriam- a 20minute piece Ill let you to discover for yourself. Then there are 11 Bonus Shorts which are actually 2 minute (or less) outtakes or extended interviews. They are still interesting but they aren't fully realized shorts that would stand on their own.

If you find design an interesting subject  and especially if you are aware of the Vignellis, then youll want to see this film and DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
