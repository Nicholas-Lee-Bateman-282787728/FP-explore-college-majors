8335243,1,B001Q8UOWE,"I got this because Lea Seydoux is in it and because the reviews I read were very good, but I think they were written by
 members of Louis Garrel's fan club. This movie is dull beyond belief. About 90% of it is involved with . . . nothing !
  High school kids talking about other kids, a teacher, quite sexy, who grabs Garrel's crotch, implying that they're sleeping
together, but then you don't see them together again. Lea Seydoux appears looking bored or depressed or whatever all
through the film. The handsome teacher is sleeping with two or three girls. Apparently in France high school teachers can have sex with the kids, right? Then he gets the hots for Lea who gets involved with a boy but she's giving him the runaround.
  She dumps him, he kills himself then we see her running around Paris with the teacher but that goes nowhere too.
  (Is this guy really going to marry a high school kid???). What a mish mash of nothing at all. She splits town, which fits
right in with her depressed attitude. The End. Voila!  You wanna buy this? You can have mine. Jesus!",1397001600,,1070,4.4512820512820515
8335244,5,B001Q8UOWE,The views of Paris are exceptional. A great film with good actors. Lea is so beautiful. She was also so good in the recent Woody Allen film .,1395964800,,141,4.071428571428571
8335245,3,B001Q8UOWE,"i have a love/hate relationship with this movie, its deeply flawed but the performances of louis garrel and Lea Seydoux are just perfect and the chemistry between those two amazing and i realy liked their story and their lines or to be accurate the lack of it when you are truly in love who needs words (maybe a spoiler)am absolutely fond of the scene in the hotel but i liked the fact that they didn't need to explain or talk through every step or move. i love Christophe Honore but this was not one of his best, i feel that if this was a short movie focused only on those two and the silent intensity of the connection between the two charecters it would have been great because the other characters and their story lines were just pointless and yes boring and just unnecessary, if you are a fan of louis garrel watch it if you are not don't bother",1343088000,2,850,4.31875
8335246,5,B001Q8UOWE,"Based on the novel of La Princesse de Clves, I found this to be an interesting interpretation. The emotions are communicated through expressions rather than words, which seems to add more to what goes on in the film between everyone at the school. At first it was a lot to take in during the introduction - I needed to watch the film a couple times before understanding it. However, this is a nice French film to see that shows a different perspective to what high school life includes.

Garrel's performace in this film is terrific throughout the film. The way he displays his ""hidden"" emotions gives more to his feelings towards Junie.",1335571200,,637,4.6875
8335247,5,B001Q8UOWE,"I will admit I wanted to watch this film because Louis Garrel speaks Italian in it, and I also find him incredibly handsome.  But looks and some Italian words would not be enough for me to watch a film all the way through.  There has to be substance, and the movie must grab my attention from the first five minutes.

Sure, the beginning makes no dang sense, and I am not even sure what happened to Junie's mother, but this movie is excellent.  Everyone in this film has a purpose, and they all do brilliantly.  Louis Garrel does well as the tortured Italian teacher who has feelings for a female student.

I too, like other fans, own and obsess over Les Chansons d'amour, but I feel this movie is just as excellent.  It's a peek inside what being a French student is like (or so I am assuming since I am American), and how we're not really all that different.  It's quite realistic, with people being picked on for differences, the pressure to have a boyfriend, the list goes on infinitely.

I highly recommend this movie.  You have to give the movie a chance, don't judge something in the first twenty minutes.",1322352000,5,1112,4.46039603960396
8335248,1,B001Q8UOWE,"...that this movie is boring beyond belief, going nowhere, has NO real plot & can't be entertaining!! It is only about an arrogant self-centered group of teenagers, nothing more or less!! So unless you consider yourself one of these, don't waste your time!! Also you need a cheat sheet to keep track of who is sleeping with whom! The girls are ordinary looking & the pretty boys are worse--not even any 'eye candy' to redeem this sad attempt at a French art movie. See a classic like 'Amelie' for a true French treat!",1311465600,,517,4.56989247311828
8335249,3,B001Q8UOWE,"Well produced and photographed, a nothing special movie centering around a group students in their senior years at a French School.
As seen in this type of movie, the usual ""Classroom antics"" of smiles, glances and the passing of little notes around the room.
Rent, first up if you can. The story could well be the same at a school telling the story of students much younger, with not much difference as it plays out.
I would also add that the ""Rating"" could actually be ""R"" as really nothing here to justify the ""Not Rated"" category, but not really suitable for very young people.
I'm always suspicious that the ever growing numbers of movies with this NR category is a bit of an intentional ploy from the movie houses which has the affect of pushing sales.",1310169600,5,758,4.580882352941177
8335250,5,B001Q8UOWE,"This is a lovely, deliberate, melancholy look into the fairy-tale lives of pale, beautiful, preternaturally graceful high-school students in Paris - a dreamy, pearly, wintry Paris on which the harsh sun never, ever shines.

The Beautiful Person is so hypnotically beautiful that it drew me through the somewhat jarring adjustment I had to make from my placid late-middle-aged American world into theirs, which teems with sex and longing, but - Oh, my! - it was worth it. This movie is luxurious and delightful.

Some of those who do not like it may be unwilling or unable to make such a cultural adjustment, but those who do will be rewarded. Reviews on other sites encouraged me to hang in there through the rough patches in the beginning, when I could not even tell who was who and doing what with whom. Those reviews also hinted that I might be slightly disappointed after Christophe Honor's last movie, the remarkable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Songs/dp/B001DJ7PUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Songs</a>. I was not at all. This is a sadder movie, but it is no less deeply satisfying.

Like Love Songs, renting this one is not enough: I need my own copy so I can watch it over and over. Also like Love Songs, I expect the pleasure it gives will get richer with each viewing.

Something nice I just realized: there are no drugs in this movie, hardly any alcohol (none at all among the kids), no vomiting, no farting, no bullying, no mindless cruelty or grossness of any kind. In other words: This is not an American movie for American teenagers. It is probably not even a realistic view of Parisian teenagers (even they must have a few pimples), but realistic or not it is a joy to behold.",1305849600,24,1747,4.993127147766323
8335251,5,B001Q8UOWE,"This film is meandering, luscious, and full of beautiful people, as well as a beautiful city.  I cannot wait till I can own it myself and watch it over and over.",1297209600,2,161,4.193548387096774
