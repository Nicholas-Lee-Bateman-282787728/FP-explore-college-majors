8757358,1,B01DYZ6NFS,I would actually rate this a zero if I had the choice based on what I thought it was supposed to be. It's a dvd with nothing but the audio from the Freed Shows which I've had for decades. I expected to at least see kids dancing but this was certainly misrepresented. Very disappointing for sure.,1468800000,2,295,4.285714285714286
