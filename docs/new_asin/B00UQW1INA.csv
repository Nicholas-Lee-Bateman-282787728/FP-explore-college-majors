7067183,4,B00UQW1INA,It's like another Cinderella story but from the man's perspective.  Interesting but not one I would watch again.  I didn't get vested in the characters in this one.  But it was an interesting way to look at an old story.,1443312000,2,220,4.45

8707879,4,B00UQW1INA,"Rebecca is adorable. I know her from ""The girls guide to depravity""  (a Cinemax series) and only rented it to see her more of her work.  I might be biased since I have a crush on her but 4 stars is my rating.",1488412800,,208,3.813953488372093

8707881,2,B00UQW1INA,"Not sure where this movie went wrong but my BF and I turned it off before it was half through as we weren't enjoying it.
Possibly Jamie Kennedy's character was just too depressing.  The female lead was pretty - yet this film just lacked in spark of life or enthusiasm.",1456012800,,268,4.36

8707884,1,B00UQW1INA,"I should have looked to see how many bad reviews there were before purchasing this.
It was pretty awful. Who cast Jamie Kennedy as the love interest & then didn't even try to clean him up ? His face looks bloated with acne scars under his facial grundge. Plus, he's is sporting the hair of an unwashed homeless man. His bumbling charm is more like a halfwit stalker & for a writer he is incredibly in articulate. The story goes from having possibilities to painfully awkward.",1448150400,2,475,4.534883720930233
