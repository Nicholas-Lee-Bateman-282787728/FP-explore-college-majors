5053476,5,B0073K97VS,"Gilad is just awesome!  This workout is for intermediate-advanced exercisers if you use the medicine ball.  There is about a 5 minute warm-up and then right into the standing and lunging drills swinging a medicine ball to engage the core.  I am 57 years old female, intermediate exerciser, with 30 pounds to lose, a bad right knee and I could do it all the way through with a 4 pound medicine ball.  Using my heart rate monitor, I got into 60-75% max heart rate range.  The moves are easy, no fancy choreography.  Gilad is encouraging and the group exercising with him have varying abilities.  If you need to modify because your arms are tired, like mine got, just lift part way.  Another option is to use a 2 or 3 pound dumbbell instead of the medicine ball.  If you can't jump, don't. If you can't lunge as far, don't.  I modified and I got the workout I was looking for.  You can feel those core muscles working.  After about 45 minutes, you end with about a 5 minute cool-down stretch using the medicine ball.  The stretches were great and really target the hamstrings, back and arms.  Overall, a solid aerobic and toning workout, working also on a bit of balance and stretching.  Great workout.",1340323200,34,1199,4.537383177570093
5053477,5,B0073K97VS,"In this workout, all abdominal work is done standing with the heavy ball.  The heavy ball is equivalent to a 3 to 5 pound dumbbell or a medium-weight medicine ball.  (I used a medium-weight medicine ball.) This is an intermediate or advanced workout depending on the weight of your ball and your desired cardio intensity level.

I liked the variety that this abs workout offered.  This is another way to work your abs and includes working your arms through various planes of motion, with quite a bit of cardio, including jumps, lunges, squats, and side steps.

Total workout time (51:19)

Warm up (4:18) This is cardio and stretches.
Workout (40:01) Work your abs in a cardio fashion with many arm movements.

5053481,5,B0073K97VS,I really like to workout with this guy.,1449014400,,39,4.0
5053482,5,B0073K97VS,This is an excellent work out for the medicine ball.  Gilad is a pleasure to work with and he knows how the body works.  I recommend this.,1433462400,,138,4.074074074074074
5053483,5,B0073K97VS,"About two years ago I purchased the Core & More DVD. I just recently picked it up and after going through it twice I thought maybe there might be an update. That is when I came upon the Lord of the ABS series. So since I have a heavy ball (6 pounds), I purchased the Maximum ABS DVD as a compliment to the other Abs DVD. So far I like it. Everything is done standing. The first time I went through the program I was really worn out, and since I am about two years out from rotator cuff surgery, the shoulders were fired up.
I needed three days to recover the first go-round and after the second and third time through this DVD I like it. Can already feel some of those ab muscles missed in the Core & More being activated. I used my heart rate monitor on the third run through the DVD and averaged 134 BPM. So you are working your abs but also getting a good cardio.
- I am a 57 year old man, used to be very active prior to ACL knee blow out, and the latest rotator cuff blow out so I am not working at 100% but I think this program, especially after a month of keeping it in my exercise rotation, will be a great benefit to my aging abs.
- So far, I think this program, is VERY good.",1433462400,7,1185,3.941666666666667

5053485,5,B0073K97VS,"This is a pretty fun workout. I hate to work my abs, so I was looking for something different than the usualy crunch type abdominal workouts. I felt this one everywhere the next day. I used a 4 pound ball. I might try it using a slightly heavier hand weight and see how it goes.",1424390400,2,278,4.072727272727272
5053486,5,B0073K97VS,"Lots of creativity in this workout - the weighted ball makes the difference. Since lots of the movements orient toward opposites (left & right, front & back), a lighter weighted ball helps to make the switches go smoother and keep up with the pace of the moves. Helps a lot with the upper back and shoulder regions, too.",1415491200,2,320,4.5344827586206895
5053487,5,B0073K97VS,"Standing up for the whole workout is quite a difference from other Gilad workouts.  This is a heavy duty workout and for the advanced persons. At present, I am getting to where I can get through it. Again, the routines are preferable and I don't find myself getting lost and it is fun to keep up with.",1410739200,3,301,4.280701754385965
5053488,5,B0073K97VS,Gilad Lord of the Abs: Maximum Abs! Heavy Ball is great.  For me it is a complete body workout and not just the abs.  I had the video for three weeks and I am already noticing some change in my abdominal and other parts of my body. I find it much easier to use the dumbbell instead of the heavy ball.  This video works out the arms as well.,1408665600,2,340,3.898550724637681
5053489,5,B0073K97VS,"I stand by this video within 2wks  of doing this i started to notice my stomach was slowly begining to go in at the beginning of doing this i weighed 319lbs. and by the end of the first 2wks. i was down to 290 now i'm gonna slowly include my billy blanks amp'd workouts with this in hopes of speeding up the weight loss. i was feeling that burn all throughout the day in my core and the best thing about these exercises is that you never lay on the floor, i don't any ball when i do this i use a gatorade bottle as my weight and i still feel it at the end of the workout , anybody that wishes to lose their stomach without all the strain on the neck and back i definitely recommend trying this.",1407196800,8,694,3.9571428571428573
5053490,5,B0073K97VS,"I love this workout with the medicine ball. At first I used a dumbbell, but ended up purchasing the Aeromat Dual Grip Medicine Ball and like doing this workout even better. The w/o  gets your heart rate up and the first few times my shoulders were ""screaming"" about half way through (LOL!). I lift weights so I am not sure if it was using a dumbbell instead of a medicine ball or what, but now my shoulders don't seem to want to ""give-up"" half-way through anymore. Nevertheless, I recommend this w/o for something different and fun to add to your abs workouts.",1395360000,3,560,4.490196078431373
5053491,5,B0073K97VS,"I own other workout videos from Gilad and he is a timeless instructor that keeps giving results!

This workout is wonderful because all you need is a little bit of room, and just a 2-4lb medicine ball! If you don't have a ball, you can simply use a 2-5 lb weight OR a child's play ball (basketball, soccerball, etc), or even a small pillow if you are new to working out!

I love that this workout is aerobic while working abs. I own other workouts who use medicine balls for abs, but this one is just a great solid cardio/standing ab workout using the ball the whole time. I have a 4lb medicine ball and this worked greatly. When I first did this video I used a 3lb weight just to get used to the moves and I still got a very good workout! It does work the shoulders as others have mentioned, but I find that keeping your core tight and focusing more on your abs and not your shoulders-will reap better results. The first segments you do feel it alot in your shoulders but if you feel you are getting sore, you can modify by not lifting your arms too high and keep them a bit lower.

This workout is much longer than any ""ab"" workout but I feel it is great to use for a ""cardio day"" without having to worry that I need to add an ""ab workout"" at the end. This has both!! I really felt this one in my abs the next day, but not TOO sore that I felt overworked either. ;) The aerobics are more low impact as you don't do any jumping around-however-there IS a man in the workout who does higher modifications where he does the high impact moves, so you can choose to power up your moves if you want. There is lots of different moves in this workout that keeps you from getting board. Some moves you do while just standing.

The moves are very basic and easy to follow and his cuing is very good. :)

Get ready to turn, twist, crunch, and chop your way to great abs in no time! I love Gilad's workouts!",1392249600,13,1896,4.127371273712737
5053492,1,B0073K97VS,"I bought this based on great reviews and because I have a medicine ball but no workouts really that include one. I really can't put my finger on it,but this dvd had serious dread factor. I did about 25 minutes and the was honestly so miserable that I had to stop. Like I said,it wasn't anything I can pinpoint-I just didn't like it at all. I have Stephanie Levinsons  latest dvd and it has a short 10 minute
 segment using a medicine ball and it is so much fun! This was my first Gilad dvd and definitely will be my last.",1390608000,,521,4.148514851485149

5053498,5,B0073K97VS,I like this dvd very much. Gilad is one the best trainers ever! He takes that extra step to teach his moves so they are done correctly.

8509290,5,B0073K97VS,"I first saw Gilad, who I've been exercising with since the early 90's, use a heavy ball in his workout routine in one of his 30th anniversary shows. What a revelation to get a total body workout without going to the ground. At only 21 minutes, those shows became too easy to do. I ordered this dvd and couldn't be happier. This is a total of 55 minutes and a much harder workout. When I first tried it, I had to tap out midway through. Now I can finish it with no problem. I first used an 8 lb heavy ball, which was a big mistake. It was impossible to keep up at their speed. So I ordered a 6 lb ball from Amazon. Much easier.
I lost 20 lbs in about 8 weeks and I have abs now! They are still somewhat hidden under a layer of fat, but I am getting there. I highly recommend this series.",1528243200,,786,3.949685534591195
