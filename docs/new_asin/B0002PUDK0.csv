8030246,1,B0002PUDK0,"Just watched this DVD and was shocked at how lame it was..while it contained some bits of interesting advice, it's more of a commercial for his company --to get people to attend a seminar or hire his training company vs actually providing content that gives you the tools to run a media training. This DVD should be free. Its really a teaser to hire him or his company. Charging $99 for a brief overview of media training is a waste.",1118016000,4,433,4.425
