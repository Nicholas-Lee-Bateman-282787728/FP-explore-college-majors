For me watching these DVDs is a way to extend my learning from the classes I have been fortunate to take with Bill. But these DVDs would also be excellent for someone new to his abstract painting style as well. He is an excellent teacher and explains what he is thinking about and the reasons behind what he is doing as he demos. He informs you of the materials he is using and gives you parameters for good composition and color theory as well as helpful hints and his philosophy. I will enjoy watching his DVDs again and again in my studio, doing some of the many exercises he presents along with him! Thank you, Bill.",1334793600,3,1058,5.876623376623376

I think the techniques shown here are exciting and can provide a jumping off point for any artist. I am a figure artist and am inspired to use some of the techniques and new (to me) materials shown here to that end. And while the techniques and materials are exciting, fun, sexy and innovative, the road to improving one's art is work, experiment, practice and more practice; but having fun along the way is allowed. That is one of the core messages I got from this DVD. Bill's teaching style and presentation are extremely accessible and his excitement is contagious. I'd love to take a class with him,someday, but until then, I'll have my personal class time through this DVD and all the other DVD's available on Amazon. I recommend them all. (btw, his book on the figure is awesome and also highly recommended.)",1329264000,4,968,4.568965517241379
