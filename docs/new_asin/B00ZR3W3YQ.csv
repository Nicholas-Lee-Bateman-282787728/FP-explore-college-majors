7290162,3,B00ZR3W3YQ,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of the Universal Monster films. That being said, why in the world is Universal repackaging these films AGAIN?!?!?!?!? Now, at $30, yes this is a steal of epic proportions...IF you don't already own any of these on some format, but then again if you don't already own them, I suspect then that you're not that big a fan of the films in the first place.

I have owned all six of these films or some of them on several formats - VHS (all of them and twice for Frankenstein and the Wolf Man), Laser Disc (The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man), DVD (bare bones stand alone editions of all and then the fantastic Legacy Collection sets), and now Blu Ray with the Essentials collection. So, in total, I've probably spent upwards of $500 on the same six films over and over again. This doesn't even include the 'Creature From the Black Lagoon' which I would've included over 'The Invisible Man' every day of the week, and which I have also owned on VHS, DVD (twice), and Blu Ray.

I just wish that Universal will put together the definitive edition of these and release them already, because re-releasing them with an extra documentary or historian commentary here and there ain't cutting the mustard anymore.",1442880000,3,1250,4.575892857142857
7290163,5,B00ZR3W3YQ,"The first thing is first, if you already own these films, it is pointless to buy this product and then bad mouth it, just because you already have the films. This is a very nice and affordable (averaging at $5 per film) little collection of the best of the best of classic monster horror, like only Universal Studios can deliver. You get Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Bride of Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man in this collection. They all are on their own disc. They all have great (recycled) extra features. They all look and sound great. The packaging is compact, but very good. Each disc is kept safe on its own prong. Packaging is important with box sets these days due to companies going cheap and releasing damaged products. This is a great buy and a very good introduction for those whom are new to the Universal Monsters. For people like myself, there is nothing new in here to offer me, but it is a handy and convenient smaller pack of the movies that is easier to deal with doing a monster movie marathon and also easier to take to friends' houses. Universal did a nice job with this collection. This is a very good Halloween season purchase.",1442188800,123,1173,4.563981042654029
7290164,1,B00ZR3W3YQ,"How many times is Universal going to repackage and recycle the same films over and over again? This is getting monotonous. Why don't they release Blu Ray versions of Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, The Mummy's Hand, The Mummy's Tomb, The Mummy's Ghost, The Mummy's Curse, Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us? That's something Universal Monster fans could get excited about.",1440979200,10,435,5.140845070422535
7290165,5,B00ZR3W3YQ,"Universal Classic Monsters Collection

These are the classic horror monster films from Universal movie picture studio produced in the 1930's [the Great Depression]. There were the sequels for these movies, which can be found in other collections. Universal Studios was the producer of many horror movies in the 1930s. The make-up or disguises also set a standard used in later movies. Most of the players were not star actors. They set a standard for other movie producers. You will probably like some movies over others.

The essence about these movies is a threat that comes upon the people. But by informed action the people are able to overcome and destroy these monsters. The book Hollywood Horror by Mark A. Vieira is a complement to these mid-budget movies. Curt Siodmak was the talented scriptwriter who created many of the facts associated with these monsters (garlic, silver bullets, etc.). For more details read the individual reviews. There was a 1931 Spanish language version of Dracula, it was not censored for the British Empire.

1) Dracula (1931).
2) Frankenstein (1931).
3) The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).
4) The Wolfman (1941).
5) The Invisible Man (1933).
6) The Mummy (1932).",1436486400,6,1198,5.1020408163265305

Your blu rays will be scratched in a few months, just by trying to get them off or put back onto the package bumps, without the other one falling onto the floor. One sits on top of the other half way over. It took me 3 minutes to try and figure out how to get the second one out. The top one was shoved on so tight and would not come off, but a lower one had already come loose in shipping, and it was rattling in box before being opened.

7290363,5,B00ZR3W3YQ,"This was my introduction to the Universal Monsters. All of these films are first rate chillers, though not necissarily scary by modern standards they stand the test of time. I'll review each one briefly, but the short answer is if you don't own these movies already, buy this collection.

DRACULA (1931) One of the early sound films, this is a great adaptation of the novel as well as an important film in history. Lugosi is legendary as Dracula, and the lack of music fresh off the silent era just gives it more atmosphere.

FRANKENSTEIN(1931) Another incredibly important film, this one strays quite a bit from the source material, but again has excellent atmosphere. Dr. Frankenstein's lab has an amazing look to it, and the strikes of lighting really add to the mad scientist feel. And of course, the amazing Boris Karloff plays the best version of the monster to ever appear on screen

THE WOLFMAN(1941) The key word is atmosphere. The spooky sets and use of fog make this a movie to be watched alone in the dark under a full moon. Lon Chaney Jr. plays Larry Talbot (The Wolfman) with incredible conviction. You truly feel sorry for him when he gets this curse. Definitely a great film.

THE INVISIBLE MAN(1933) An excellent example of power corrupting a man's brain, Claude Raines steals the show as our main monster. This one has a humorous element as well, which just adds to it's overall greatness

THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) This is a rare example of a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor. Everything that was great about the first film is turned up, adding more emotion to the story. The monster is painted as a misunderstood creature here, and you really feel sorry for the poor thing. From start to finish, this surprising emotional film will have you completely invested.

THE MUMMY (1932) This one is a bit different from the rest of the bunch. Instead of your bandaged zombie mummy wandering around killing people, Boris Karloff's Imhotep speaks and interacts with other character's. He spends almost no time in the bandages and is trying to bring back the spirit of his lover, which rests in the soul of the female lead. A love story that's lasted a thousand years, this one is a little different but just as good as the rest.

So there you have it, great films, and a great collection. Definitely worth buying if you haven't seen these before",1494115200,19,2369,4.735436893203883

7290422,4,B00ZR3W3YQ,"I am absolutely thrilled I bought this set.  From the first film I watched, including the special segments to what I just watched a short while ago to the special segment on Lon Cheney, Jr., I have been transfixed on not only the quality but the content.

So why only Four Stars?  The cardboard sleeves for the discs are problems waiting to happen.  The are not soft and will eventually allow a disc to get scraped.  I know of what I speak because it happened to me before owning the Torchwood Collection.  Too bad really, as this is set up as a booklet with different pages for each individual movie.  Had it included a softer padding between the cardboard and disc, it would have been perfect in every way.

(Typical of engineers to design something they'll never use.)",1479513600,2,771,4.536231884057971
