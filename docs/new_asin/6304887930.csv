The editing is flawlessly done, creating stories inside stories of the people behind the ship itself.  Combined with the hauntingly brilliant soundtrack, it is a touching, empowering, and honest portrayal of the tireless human desire to explore and go beyond.",1005868800,4,378,5.283333333333333
7880266,5,6304887930,"While this program is now several years old, it stills ranks as one of my favorite all time Discovery Channel programs. The music and filming are exceptional and the interviews are candid and insightful. It gives everyone a good glimpse of how the entire shuttle mission crew works together and just how much goes into every flight. I wish it could be updated and released on DVD. The sound track is still phenomenal.",1004054400,3,417,4.726027397260274
