I can only recall the English lyrics--""If it takes forever, I will wait for you. For a thousand summers, I will wait for you. 'Til I'm back beside you, 'til I'm touching you. And forever more, I'll wait for you!"" The splash of color in the film--from Catherine Deneuve's clothes to the set design are just gorgeous; while at the same time, a contrast to the somber mood of the film. It is a story of a young girl and the love of her life who has to go to Algeria to serve in the army. While he is away, she is pursued by an equally charming and wealthy suitor. Who does she choose and how does it affect her life? Only a French film maker can produce this kind of film that will make you smile, and swoon, and cry all at the same time. A truly lovely and unforgettable cinematic experience.",1116115200,,954,4.218579234972678

Also, I am not usually one for love stories or romances, but this film is so simple and sweet, colorful and anti-Hollywood endings, that it really endeared itself to me. Catherine Deneuve is pretty and charming, and her men are likable. This is good  to watch on a rainy afternoon, and a fun way to get your foreign movie fix.
Everytime I see an umbrella now, I think of ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg.""",973382400,3,585,4.318181818181818
7913507,5,B00000JS7N,"What I thought initially, ""Oh no, not one and a half hours of pure music, no speaking,""  soon changed within a few minutes to ""This is going to be an  exciting movie."" Being a visual person I was first strike by the color  arrangements in and outside and although the music was quite ordinary  except for the hit number I Will Wait for You, I started to realize that  this New Wave type film was making fun of the earlier American musicals and  of Hollywood itself. Jacques Demy doesn't just poke fun at the Frenchman's  ""friend"" across the Atlantic but also of the French themselves.
  In  France one of the worst crimes is to be bourgeois, in other  words middle  class. Wealthy is fine, the rich don't have to put on a show, and being  poor has its dignity, a glass of wine and a puff on a Gauloises, an  intellectual conversation in some smoky dive, what could be better?
  The clever color schemes mainly those in Madame Emery's home first of all  reflect the middle class attitude that is the Emerys have a sense of taste.  The clothes have to match the wallpaper, and not only that each room has to  match the person who lives or sleeps in it. We can see this nowadays with  the Laura Ashley designs, the curtains, wallpaper, even the bedclothes have  the same color and pattern. Laura Ashley stores can be found in all the  correct places such as the South Coast Plaza Mall in Costa Mesa where  everyone who thinks they are somebody shops, and if this monument is too  expensive then a cheaper version of this matching phenomenon can be found  in K-Mart.
  I believe Jacques Demy took a look at the extreme  exaggerations of the Hollywood musical and then went one or two steps  further. We can see Aunt Elise also has taste because her  apartment has a  color scheme of  red and cream, even her bedclothes have the same hues. Guy  arrives from the hallway which is decorated in blue. He has on a pair of  denims and a blue pullover that makes him appear from the blue room almost  translucent. After his conversation with Auntie he departs to another room  that is also blue. Now I'm sure there's no deep psychological meaning to  this but purely Demy enjoying himself.
  If we take a look at the plot  it isn't very dramatic compared to American films. This is another case  where Demy is manipulating the audience. We see these exuberant colors  throughout the film and all the time I am expecting something very exciting  or different to happen. But it's just a love story, with hardly any ups or  downs, everything is on an even keel with Genevieve and Guy going their own  way, similar to the average person. Genevieve ends up wealthy just as her  mother wished, and Guy owns an ordinary service station. This is also part  of the fun because in a Hollywood film, a musical, a comedy or a more  serious plot, the protagonist normally ends up with wealth, fame, and a  girl on his arm. In Umbrellas at the end we see Guy who has just seen his  old flame in a posh car drive away from his very down to earth workplace,  and he never saw his kid. It's also snowing to add salt to the wound, no  Malibu skyline here, and he  continues on with life as he plays snowballs  with his son.
  Now why didn't Demy choose exciting Paris or Marseilles  on the Riviera for the location, here's another finger up at Hollywood.  Cherbourg is on the north coast of France bordering the Bay of Biscay and  the English Channel with the Atlantic winds blowing from the West through  the streets with lots of rain, a thoroughly depressing place, not the  Mediterranean where Bridget Bardot or Jean-Paul Belmondo would hang around.  From a quick look this film is just a musical, not a bad musical  though, but this really is a pure tongue-in-cheek version of the films such  as Band Wagon and I can definitely see shades of Singin'  in the Rain when  comparing the street scenes. In Singin' they are suppose to be real, well  kind of, and in Umbrellas they are real but over painted to look  artificial. Umbrellas and Rain, I think there must be some kind of  connection.  I believe the French were having a good laugh when they  made this film and I'm sure they thoroughly enjoyed themselves.",967161600,4,4186,4.473404255319149
