8483286,4,B005QDN3FU,"Great fun in the old Hollywood way.  I am a sucker for Foreign Legion movies, and this one has a cast that can't be beat.  Not the classic that ""Beau Geste"" is, but still a wonderful time.",1461542400,,188,4.054054054054054

8483288,4,B005QDN3FU,"In the turn of the century (the 20th) Algiers, a Sergeant (Ronald Colman) in the French Foreign Legion incurs the animosity of his superior (Victor McLaglen) when the Major believes the Sergeant has stolen the affection of a cabaret performer (Claudette Colbert). In actuality, the Sergeant has his sights set on a visiting English rose (Rosalind Russell). Based on a novel by Ouida which had already been filmed four times (including a silent with Theda Bara in the Colbert role) by the time director Frank Lloyd got his turn, the emphasis is on romance rather than action. Colman is all wrong for a romantic action hero but fortunately a sexy and sassy Claudette Colbert manages to convince us that he's worth slobbering over. While it's no GUNGA DIN or BEAU GESTE, it's a decent ""Meet me at the oasis under the blue moon"" kitschy romanticization of colonial North Africa. Palm Springs and Arizona stand in for Algeria. With Gregory Ratoff, Nigel Bruce, John Carradine and Onslow Stevens as the warring Arab chieftain.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a decent transfer with both English and Spanish soundtracks.",1391904000,4,1108,4.925133689839572

I've waited patiently for over a month now, and my inquiries to you remain ignored.  NOT the way to treat your customers... I guess I  will have to contact Amazon about what to do to recover my $17+.",1377216000,6,325,4.046875
