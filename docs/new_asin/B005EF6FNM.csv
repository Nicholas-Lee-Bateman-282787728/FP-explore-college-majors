I was glad to have a glimpse of Amr in his younger days but the film is typical of the 60's/70s pop films which were vehicles for what have now become music videos.  Typical lack of storyline, cardboard characters, hammy acting and still at the end of it I am not quite sure what was going on for half of it.

That did not spoil it for me though as anyone who has sat through The Beatles 'Hard Day's Night' is used to this sort of film.

I actually enjoyed it myself, but if you are not a die-hard Amr Diab fan it will not be for you I think, although if you are an Arabic speaker you will get more enjoyment from it.",1351209600,,836,4.073170731707317
