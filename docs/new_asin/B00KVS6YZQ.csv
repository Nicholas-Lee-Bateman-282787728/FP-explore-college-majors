6451607,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"Here's what to expect:

4K Print
The first improvement is a 4K transfer, so it will look grand at the cineplex and fabulous on 1080P. It was released theatrically last year in Great Britain for Vivien Leigh's centenary, so maybe some kind soul will share with us. The print will play in North American cinemas on 28-September-2014 and 1-Octoer-2014, with only two screenings on each date--so don't miss it!

VISIBLE CHANGES
Second, based on the IMAX-projected Wizard Of Oz 3D (same studio), virtually all screen noise (dirt, scratches and jitters) will have been removed--it's amazing!. Oz now looks to have been filmed yesterday and the 3D might be native, too (remember, the 3D conversion was constructed from the completed giant screen restoration). In IMAX, I could see the original Technicolor IB matrix--the film equivalent of pixels. The lack of visual noise on was plain on 1080i broadcasts and easily demonstrated by your own comparison with any pre-2013 home video. Warners has this new Oz print in TV circulation, so you can see its pristine images the next time it's broadcast. The Oz 3D theatrical release was advertised as IMAX-only and One-week-only, but it promptly moved to a few neighborhood RealD screens. Since boffo was tepid, Warners may have flagged off the expense of a 3D conversion for GWTW, or put it on the shelf for when 3D popularity waxes.

Finally, Selznick International, er, really the micro-managing perfectionist David O. Selznick, famously ran out of time editing in special effects before the 1939 Atlanta Premier and declined to change them thereafter. Check out the first shot of the Twelve Oaks scenes showing the tree-lined driveway, and you'll notice the lack of interplay between the horse-and-carriages and the light-and-shadows. Selznick himself didn't fix the processes, but Warners may have decide to make some ""improvements.""

WIDESCREEN UPDATE
And about that elusive WIDESCREEN release of GWTW: it does exist, somewhere, and you *don't* want to see it. Although several ""widescreen"" processes were developed well before GWTW's production, it was filmed in the standard screen ratio on three strips of 35-mm film. However, in 1954 it was released [mangled] in a 1.75:1 aspect ratio and five shots were irrevocably damaged through physical alterations/cuts of the original 3-strip Technicolor negative. Maybe these will be restored now. Oh, there was a 1967 70-mm upscale. Read all about it at http://goo.gl/GdL33g, see all of the posters at http://goo.gl/LL4S1v and read ""Memo From David O. Selznick"" http://goo.gl/lUrpwd",1410739200,6,2570,5.291666666666667

6451609,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"An erroneous response to a reviewer must be corrected.  The reviewer was wondering why there is no widescreen version of GWTW.  Correctly, the 2nd reviewer responded that until around 1952, there were few, very rare, films released in aspect ratios of greater than 1.33:1.  GWTW was created in 1939, long before Cinerama, CinemaScope, Todd-AO, Panavision, VistaVision were invented.  HOWEVER, Metro Goldwyn Mayer decided in 1967 that to cash in on the great, disasterous trend toward roadshow films (those with reserved seats, intermission, overture, etc.), they would take GWTW and crop it to fit 70mm. film for widescreen projection.  Metro had done a conversion of this title in the late 1950s which stretched the image, but DID have a carefully created stereo soundtrack.  The 1967 70mm. version (with a 2:1 aspect ratio) had a six-track soundtrack created by splitting the sound indiscriminately into six channels and so, there was amplified background noise instead of careful separation.  The 70mm. edition, cropped and blown up though it might have been, was a huge hit, both as a roadshow and a general release.  GWTW has always seemed like a natural for widescreen exhibition, but it simply was NOT shot that way.  However, due must be paid to MGM for both of their attempts to create a widescreen version, although neither of these attempts has ever been released on any format of home video.",1404172800,2,1403,5.091703056768559

6451617,2,B00KVS6YZQ,I bought this for my wife for Christmas this year. When she opened it and took out the music box the top of the music box was not glued to the body of the music box. We Google this product and found an unboxing video. We watched the video to see if the music box was suppose to be a one piece or two piece music box. The video showed the person holding the music box by the top and it was a one piece. So I contacted Amazon for a replacement. When the replacement box set arrived my wife opened and the replacement music box didn't have its top glued to the body of the music box. It appears to be very cheaply made and not checked to see if it was glued correctly. Not a very good 75th Anniversary set.,1483660800,,703,3.9577464788732395

6451623,2,B00KVS6YZQ,"A pointless reissue of one of the greatest movies of all time. Warner Home Video gave us a superior box set two years before this one; tricked out in red velvet with original poster art augmenting the cover. I am really at a loss to explain Warner's reissue in Emerald City green lettering. We get a new featurette and a booklet that any teenager savvy with Photoshop could have done twice as good. Also, a cheaply embroidered handkerchief, presumably a collectible from Rhett Butler, and a really diminutive music box that barely plays Tara's theme in its entirety before winding down. The red velvet box had reproductions of memos from David O. Selznick and a far more comprehensive hardbound booklet to offer. Bottom line: it's Gone With the Wind - one of the most beloved movies of all time and a personal favorite. If you own the previous box set, you can pass on this one. If you don't then this one is decidedly for you to appreciate many years into the future. I just wish Warner would go back and correct the few egregious examples of edge enhancement scattered throughout this transfer. Otherwise, it is very close to perfect.

(I had bought the Box set from the States as it was not available in the UK - and had the DVDs not played, my intention was to replace with UK DVDs and put them in the special annivsary box - but there was no need)

6451647,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"This is the first blue-ray disc I ever owned and it was mildly fascinating and kind of ruined the magic a little when, through the incredibly clear detailing, I could actually see the kind of movie magic they did to create certain effects, such as the screen that Dr. Mead was talking to during the charity ball.

I've owned three other versions of the movie so far and none has given the same quality of sound and visuals as this one so that is definitely something to look forward to for ""Gone with the Wind"" fans.

At the moment, both the 75th anniversary tokens (the handkerchief and the music box) are still hidden inside the box because I don't know where I can safely store them without my toddler destroying either one, or possibly both. But oh the thrill of listening to the theme song in music box form! Maybe I'll set up a vanity table and put it there just so I can listen to it whenever I put on my makeup.

6451652,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"My husband bought me the anniversary edition of GWTW on tape years ago.  Now, with the recent talk about possibly banning GWTW, which is what history revisionists want to do, I hopped on Amazon and got this edition.  I have watched GWTW every so often for many years, and I expect to enjoy this one for many years.  I used to read GWTW every year when I was younger, and, I guess, more of a romantic; I kept hoping the end would be different and Rhett wouldn't leave.  Sadly, my hopes never came true (like I said, I was young), so I will watch the terrific performances in this wonderful, classic, iconic movie.

Buying this 75th anniversary edition in Blu-Ray and seeing it advertised at 1080P I expected 16/9 ratio ""letterboxed"" where the movie extended across the entire width of the screen with a black bar across the top and bottom. Instead the movie takes up the top to bottom of the 1080p TV but leaves black bars to the left and right of the screen. It's like watching Gone With the Wind on an old TV with the old 4/3 aspect ratio. This means a significant part of the movie is missing far left and far right. Totally disappointed! And Warner Brothers knew they were doing this this way and they left this information off the packaging. Now the fun part...

6451662,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"Jewel in the crown of the greatest year in motion picture history is GONE WITH THE WIND, David Selznick's epic four-hour adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel. Part soap opera/part chronicle of an Antebellum way of life soon to disappear forever, that of genteel Southerners made rich from plantation slave labor. Leigh is the self-centered mistress of stately Tara, a woman who loves unrequitedly but marries other men to advance herself financially. In the end she loses devoted husband Rhett (Gable), their young daughter Bonnie Blue (King) and the man of her dreams, Ashley Wilkes (Howard), yet Scarlett O'Hara undauntedly thinks only of a better tomorrow. A bit long in spots but worth the investment of time.

GWTW TRIVIANA--
The first cut ran 4.5 hour but 48 minutes were trimmed before release. Since then, not a second of footage has been eliminated from various home video versions.

The crane shot where Scarlett searches for Dr. Meade was devised by Val Lewton. He went on to produce a number of classic fright films, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CAT-PEOPLE/dp/6301327969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CAT PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;(1942) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BODY-SNATCHER/dp/6301327977/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BODY SNATCHER</a>&nbsp;(1945).

Clark Gable's per-day salary was five times as much as Vivien Leigh's.

Yakima Canutt stunted for Gable in the burning of Atlanta sequence, which was the very first scene shot in what would be a marathon production.

Motion picture debut of George Reeves (TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman/dp/B000A5046K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman</a>).

Margaret Mitchell borrowed the novel's title from Ernest Dowson's poem, ""Cynara"": ""I have forgot much Cynara! Gone with the wind."" Mitchell also considered calling it ""Bugles Sang True,"" ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" and ""Ba! Ba! Black Sheep."" Ashley Wilkes was based on the author's cousin by marriage, 'Doc' Holliday of OK Coral fame.

Martin Luther King Jr. attended the world premiere cotillion ball in Atlanta with his father, an invited guest. Also at the premiere were a handful of Confederate Civil War veterans.

First color movie to win the Best Picture Oscar, also the longest-running. Was nominated for 13 Oscars.

The story of this classic film's creation is almost as dramatic as the movie itself.

You open it to find pictures of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh on either side. Open again to a nice foldout with black and white scenic imagery and the two Blu-rays each in it's own slot. Easy to get in and out.

The additional discs are of only passing interest and the featurette on the premiere only runs for about 13 minutes. I did not find the book on Scarlett and fashion to be terribly illuminating and I got the impression that after 75 years, there really isn't much more to say or explain about this great film. There's nothing wrong with this set; the presentation is excellent but if you were hoping for something extra about your favourite film, this isn't it.",1414627200,,637,4.547826086956522

6451766,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"First note: the original film was released in a 3:4 format.  The widescreen versions released later are not original reels:

""the 1954 reissue was the first time the film was shown in widescreen, compromising the original Academy ratio and cropping the top and bottom to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. In doing so, a number of shots were optically re-framed and cut into the three-strip camera negatives, forever altering five shots in the film."" -  Haver, Ronald (1993). David O. Selznick's Gone with the wind. Random House.

On to my review in which I will discuss more of this restoration and special edition rather than the film itself:
This is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, and I agree with the majority.  The film won 8 of the 13 Academy Awards it was nominated for including Best Picture.  It ranked #4 on the AFI '100 Years... 100 Movies' list.  Though the film has received criticism for it's depiction of slavery, it remains one of the most enduring films of all time.

The restoration of this version is simply perfect.  The technology restored the film beyond the original 35mm Technicolor format.  Gladly, the 70mm 'widescreen' reissue reels have all faded and been destroyed. The funny thing is the couple of scenes where the HD is so clear that the viewer can see the little 'glitches'.  They aren't too noticeable, and it is stunning that a film this old has just a few of these.  (You notice it in the distance shots of Tara most often.)

The extra features are a lot of fun.  The book included was very interesting and a welcome addition.  The music box is great - it plays Tara's theme.  The handkerchief is cool, but more of a nostalgic bonus than anything.

Note the Ultraviolet copy must be redeemed by 9/30/2017.  Also be aware that used copies might already have the Ultraviolet copy redeemed.

Should you own this release?  If you don't have the 70th Anniversary on Blu-Ray then YES.  (We have the 70th on DVD so we did pick this up).  It is currently the definitive version of Gone With the Wind.  In coming years, there might be better releases, but I don't foresee something better than this at this attractive a price in the next decade or so ($35.69 w/Prime was my purchase price).

6451769,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"Gone With the Wind 75th Anniversary Ultimate Collectors Edition commemorates the Hollywood epic and longtime box office champ. Released in 1939 and based on Margaret Mitchells Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the film won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel).

On the verge of the Civil War, rich, beautiful, self-centered Scarlett OHara has everything she could want  except Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). As the war devastates the South, Scarlett discovers the strength within herself to protect her family and rebuild her life. Through everything, she longs for Ashley, unaware that she is already married to the man she really loves  and who truly loves her  until she finally drives him away. Only then does Scarlett realize what shes lost try to win him back.

The new Blu-ray edition is being released in limited, numbered sets, with new packaging, new content, and new collectible memorabilia including a replica of Rhett Butlers handkerchief and a music box paperweight playing Taras Theme with an image on top of the Rhett-Scarlett kiss. Also included is a 36-page booklet on the immortal style of Gone With the Wind, written by New York fashion designer Austin Scarlett of Project Runway fame. A new featurette, Old South/New South, revisits the real-life locations depicted in Gone With the Wind, from Gettysburg to Atlanta to New Orleans, to see how the world of the Old South and the themes depicted in the film continue to inform life in the cosmopolitan world of the New South.",1413158400,,1572,5.173228346456693

6451775,3,B00KVS6YZQ,"This blue ray edition of GWTW is disappointing.  The film itself, is and always will be the best film ever made.  However, this 4-disc dvd set only has one extra feature that was not previously released.  I think about 90% of the features on this set were either on the 70th anniversary edition or are available separately.  The set also included a small music box that plays Tara's Theme, a handkerchief with Rhett Butler's initials on it, and a book that is okay.  I had been hoping for some new features that might include a tour of Margaret Mitchell's house or a tour of premiere related sites in Atlanta or even the Leslie Howard documentary that is circulating in the UK.  And then my disk for the film - during the paddock scene, it jumped so it missed Ashley's lines telling Scarlett that she loved Tara more than him. During the scene where Scarlett tears the drapes down to make the dress, the disk just stopped and I could not get it started without ejecting it and putting it back in.  Overall, this edition is not worth it - especially if you have the 70th anniversary edition.",1412467200,4,1090,4.50253807106599
6451776,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"I received my package and the set was in excellent condition. I was a little nervous because my friend had issues with hers, and I saw other people had missing discs. However, mine had all four discs and it was all beautifully packaged. The music box is a wonderful item for any fan, and the handkerchief is even better! I've been a huge fan of this film my whole life and while it can be a little overwhelming to try and keep up with the different box sets, I'm glad we went ahead and bought this one. The book it comes with details information on Scarlett's costumes, and how she is still influencing modern fashion to this day. This is a set that any diehard fan must have. You'll love it and you won't regret buying this! I have yet to actually watch the blu ray film, but I'm certain it is going to be a beautiful set!",1412294400,2,823,4.215189873417722
6451777,3,B00KVS6YZQ,"This isn't a review of the film, because its a favorite of mine, but to warn others who might be buying this as a Christmas gift! I got my Amazon order today and opened it...only to find that there is no Blu-Ray disc of the actual movie. At all. It's missing. Instead of the first disc being a Blu-Ray copy of the film, I instead got two ""Special Edition"" Blu-Rays that, upon inspection, are exact replicas. I checked all four discs in the box set, and the movie is in fact missing. I did, however, get the music box and the handkerchief, as promised, along with a thin hardcover book. None of that can do me much good, however, because the movie is nowhere to be seen.

The strange thing, though, is that this was saran-wrapped and factory sealed! It was numbered, #02832, but yet again, that doesn't matter. I really expected better from both Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment, considering how much TCM's founder, Ted Turner, loves this movie. (It was the first to be aired when TCM came to cable back in 1994.) Shame of them for quality control. And I'd be willing to bet my life on the fact that this would never have happened to Turner's other moneymaker, The Wizard of Oz.

I called Amazon.com tonight, and they are shipping me out a new box set, that hopefully, will have the movie in the package. They'll also be sending me a return shipping label for this error, at no charge to me. Once I get it and am able to verify that all is right, I will update this review.

So, to wrap it up, if you bought or are considering this for a Christmas present, please do yourself a favor and open the box prior to wrapping it and sticking it under your tree. You'll save yourself a lot of stress!",1412208000,2,1696,4.360759493670886

6451779,3,B00KVS6YZQ,"Note:  Discs 1-3 are on Blu-ray, and Disc 4 (MGM: When the Lion Roars) is not. The digital download only includes the original movie, not the extras on discs 2-4.  This is my favorite movie of all time, so the 3-star rating is only based on my disappointment that the extras are currently available only to people who have Blu-ray.  I particularly wanted the TV-movie Moviola: the Scarlett O'Hara War, which I remember from its original showing, but that is on Disc 2, and so not viewable unless you have Blu-ray.  This is one feature that is not on previous releases, which is why I bought it.  I hope they release this collection to regular DVD.",1412121600,3,647,4.543103448275862
8661988,4,B00KVS6YZQ,I bought this for my mom for her birthday and she was absolutely thrilled! She's had the same double sided dvd for like 10 years so I thought this was a great upgrade! All the nick nacks are pretty cool too. I think the worst thing is the quality of the case the actual movie discs come in. It has those stupid plastic hinges where 9/10 times they've already broken and the discs are just kind of floating in space. Other than that the movie quality was excellent!,1524268800,,464,4.284090909090909

8661990,5,B00KVS6YZQ,"Gone With The Wind, 1939 film

This 75th Anniversary release has four DVDs for its programming material. GWTW was the most successful movie in Hollywood's history. Its message of surviving an economic catastrophe must have resonated with people suffering from the Great Depression. Discs 1 and 2 contain the movie. The novel told about the very rich and their personal problems. It shows how the war affected people's lives and what happened to the survivors.

Disc 1 begins in 1861, people await ""The War for Southern Independence"" which will quickly be over. We see the society of the plantation owners (like feudal aristocracy) and their personalities. The main interest is Scarlett O'Hara and her whims and passions. Ashley rejects her, so she marries Charles who goes off to the war and dies. The South loses the Battle of Gettyburg and later Sherman's Army invades Georgia to split the Confederate states. Scarlett returns to find Tara devastated. She vows to live through this and never be hungry again.

Disc 2 begins with occupied Georgia and a new political rule. Scarlett marries a wealthy businessman to get the money needed to save Tara from the tax collector. Convicts provide cheap labor. Charles is killed in a raid on a shanty town. Scarlett is free to marry Rhett (who knows how to act for his self-interest). Scarlett faces down society while Melanie greets her. Later she asks Scarlett to look after her son and Ashley (she is going away on a long trip). But Ashley will always love Melanie. Rhett tells Scarlett he is leaving her. Saying ""I'm sorry"" can't make up for the past. ""Tomorrow is another day"" says Scarlett.",1518912000,,1639,4.888489208633094
