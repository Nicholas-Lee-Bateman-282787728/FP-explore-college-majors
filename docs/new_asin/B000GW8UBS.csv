2620181,4,B000GW8UBS,"I'm an airplane nut - always have been.  A buddy of mine came across the French title for this movie Les Chevaliers du Ciel and sent me a Wikipedia link.  Once I found the movie through my on-line delivery service, I ordered it.

And I liked it.

Granted, the plot is pretty weak and could've been much better developed, also from what I know of the French language the translations for the dubbed version are a little ""off.""  Something that would sound good in French just doesn't have the same ring to it in English.  C'est la vie.

The aerial photography sequences are breathtaking.  There were at least two shots where I said ""Wow"" out loud.  The actors are passable (though the pilots carry their roles well), the plot some what weak, and the experience overall is at least as good as some of the poor re-makes that Hollywood seem intent on shoving down our throats.  This movie isn't an Oscar winner, but like Top Gun it's enjoyable to watch despite not really capturing military or squadron life.

Four stars.",1194393600,2,1016,4.588888888888889
2620182,4,B000GW8UBS,"Think Top Gun with a Gallic twist.  Impressive air to air action and photography, real - instead of CGI flying scenes, and best of all, no blatant violations of the laws of physics.  Although the dialog is dbuued into English, the dubbing is done extremely well, and does not detract from the overall viewing experience.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Top Gun for its flying scenes.",1170028800,7,404,4.742857142857143
2620183,2,B000GW8UBS,"If you are interested in modern military airplanes, or want to enjoy the beautifully shot aerial photography, ""Les Chevaliers du ciel"" (""Sky Fighters"") is a film for you. This French action film has plenty of flight scenes that are just exciting. Moreover, unlike some Hollywood films like `Stealth,' these scenes are not CGI.

Still I have to give only two stars to this because of its messy script that fails to make good use of the thrilling scenes. Don't get me wrong here because usually I would ignore any plot holes or corny dialogues as long as these demerits do not prevent us from enjoying the actions. Sadly, in ""Sky Fighters"" they certainly do and the weak plot and impossible situations seem to drag down the otherwise fantastic materials.

The story looks simple at first. One Mirage 2000 is stolen and two French air force fighter pilots try to stop it. The stolen Mirage keeps showing an intimidating move, however, doggedly following one of them, so Captain Marchelli (Benot Magimel) shoots it down, disobeying the order from the ground. It turns out later that his decision might be wrong.

So far so good, but after that point the film begins to introduce too many things one after another, leaving the puzzled viewers far behind. Before any hints as to the stolen Mirage is given, director Grard Pirs (responsible the original `Taxi"") throws in anything that could be used as excuse for showing the flying sequences - air exercises, The Cannonball Run-like race and national security problem. Except for the shots of the air force fighters (including that of the camera inside the cockpit or the aerial cinematography over the city of Paris), there is nothing suspenseful or thrilling about the film and its conclusion is really anti-climax, nothing that would satisfy anybody.

Some people complain (with good reasons, I guess) that `Sky Fighters' resembles `Top Gun.' That is half true, half wrong. True because it features two daredevil pilots and their friendship (and love interest too). Wrong because it has a much more contrived and incredible plot that goes on and on without giving us any clue as to what we should follow in its muddled storyline. And no Meg Ryan and Kelly McGillis.",1168646400,4,2212,4.906417112299465
2620184,4,B000GW8UBS,"The film centers around the Mirage 2000 and the French Air Force. I only gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons. The first is the audio wasn't great. The timing between the lips and the sound is a little off. The second is because the story is only B movie quality. What really sets this movie apart from others is they used real shots of the jets and didn't use CGI. They weren't cheap about putting the planes in the movie either, you will see lots and lots of the Mirage 2000 in action as well as a few other planes. If you have a love of aviation you will really enjoy watching this movie, if nothing else just for the film work they did with the Mirage 2000. You will see the Mirage 2000 flying over spectacular scenary and doing amazing manuevers!
  The creators of the film used a specially designed camera built inside a fuel pod of another Mirage 2000 to capture the aerial shots for the movie. Only another Mirage 2000 could keep up with the planes being filmed.",1163635200,10,982,4.274193548387097
2620217,4,B000GW8UBS,Wish I could have picked this up without a region restriction. Average movie but amazing flying. Leaves Top Gun in the dust for the flight scenes.,1425427200,,146,4.653846153846154
2620218,5,B000GW8UBS,"Having checked out Sky Fighters years ago, I recently looked into buying it. This movie is in a different class than Top Gun. It's a little more cleverly written and filmed, the plot is different and leaves twists and turns not expected by first time viewers. This movie is worth looking into and the aerial scenes are phenomenal.",1422230400,,330,4.706896551724138

2620221,5,B000GW8UBS,"By far a better looking film than Top Gun culd ever be. Super high def inflight sequences of modern French military aircraft. Alpha Jets, Mirages flying at low level or over the Alps. A superb film visually. Alas, like Top Gun, the stoqy line is pretty thin, but who cares, the airplanes are beautiful!",1389225600,,302,4.611111111111111
2620222,4,B000GW8UBS,"If you don't mind subtitles & you love aircraft movies you'll love this! The flying sequences are spectacular & no CGI, all the flying was done with real planes & pilots. The characters are a little cliched but you don't really notice as the acting is pretty good. The storyline is interesting (if predictable) & managed to keep me interested throughout the movie. A good, entertaining, action movie, definitely worth the rental.",1374624000,4,429,4.972222222222222
2620223,4,B000GW8UBS,"If you really go back & watch Topgun, you'll notice that the movie was kind of boring - the Tomcat made the movie!

Same w/ Les Chevaliers du Ciel, but, l'incroyablement sexy Dassault Mirage 2000 is the star of the show and her lithe sidekick la belle petite AlphaJet gets best supporting actress. If you are in it for the jets, then get it. If you want an actual movie w/ a plot, a good storyline, etc. etc., meh.",1373155200,,414,4.2405063291139244

2620225,4,B000GW8UBS,"LOVED ""Top Gun"" when it came out, and it's a classical part of my military/war flick collection, but someone told me the flying scenes in ""Sky Fighters"" were even better.  I was skeptical, but I tried this film.

I have to say I have to agree with the person who sold me on this film.  Very good visuals, especially on a big screen.  I can forgive a lot of story un-enthusiasm with imagery like that in ""Sky Fighters"".

A bit of a quirk:  I don't know if it's just me, but after watching it in French with English subtitles, the dubbed version sounds kinda clunky and choppy to me.",1337731200,2,581,4.284403669724771
2620226,4,B000GW8UBS,"If you're an aviation enthusiast this is a great foreign film that will be right up your alley. The audio is dubbed, but the action and cinematography of the aircraft is second to none! I wouldn't even compare it to the classic nature of Top Gun. This is a modern film, captured with new cameras and a plot that is applicable to today. I highly recommend for scenery alone!

I bought the dvd after seeing this - [...]

2620227,4,B000GW8UBS,"This is no Top Gun,  and I don't think they wanted it to be, the story is weak, but the flying was done very well, you will believe the actors are flying the planes, mainly because they are really in them, filmed in the rear seat while a real pilot flies. They tried this with Top Gun but the cast spent more time passed out or throwing up.

Spoiler Alert: The movie starts off with an air show, the pilot of a new Mirage 2000 plane gets kidnapped and killed at the air port (if you blink you will miss this part, it was shot a long way off and blurry, I missed it the 1st time and the story really didn't make since). Then when the plane veers from the flight plain, our hero and his wingman/buddy are dispatched to intercept. Good flight scenes, the Rogue pilot positions behind wingman/buddy and right before he takes the shot Rogue is blown out of the sky by our hero. Nice job, but not for our Hero, he was ordered to hold his fire, because the government set up the whole stealing to start off with, (however remember that the real pilot was kidnapped and killed). So Rogue pilot was stealing the plane and was going to shoot wingman/buddy, but at this time in the movie no one knows about Rogue pilot, our Hero believes he shot down a friendly, but sticks to his guns as to Rogue firing on Wingman/buddy. See if you blinked how lost you would be right now.  Watch it for the rest of the story.

This movie has the only shot ever of a real plane breaking the sound barrier at 100 feet off the runway in a movie. It is a cool shot with the air pressure wave building up in front of the plane. The flying is awesome up until the ending where toy stunt planes were brought in. I liked this movie because it shows what flying a jet would be like, a lot of amazing cockpit and aerobatic views. Watch it for the flying not for the story, which was not bad it was just weak.

The Hero,French actor Benoit Magimel carriers the movie very well, you really get to like this guy, his wingman/buddy played by Clovis Cornillac is the distinctive funny sidekick.  Some of woman in the film are over the top and the basic girl next door. No drop dead jaw dropping super models in tight jump suits, however there is a strip scene with one of the ladies. Not bad.",1317859200,,2252,4.213457076566125

2620229,1,B000GW8UBS,"If they would strip out all dialogue and plot my review would instantly add 3 stars.  Agree with others that the flight sequences are great.  The ""story"" is poorly conceived, written and performed.  Watching with the French language track takes it up a notch (the English dubbing has cartoonish voices) but just a notch.",1303948800,,320,4.888888888888889
2620230,5,B000GW8UBS,"Any aviation enthusiast will enjoy watching this movie simply from the aerial cinematography point of view.  The plot is a little predictable but the acting is reasonable and the flying sequences are just fantastic.  This movie has a greater appeal than Top Gun because all the flying is real; no computer generated images or model aircraft are involved, and you can really see the forces that are exerted on the pilots via the cockpit camera views.  The English dubbing was excellent, but even if French was the only language available, I would still enjoy watching the action.  If you're interested in modern fighter jets, you must get a copy of Sky Fighters.",1295222400,2,661,4.875
2620231,3,B000GW8UBS,"I bought this specifically for the flight scenes.  The plot, acting and english dubbing leave a lot to be desired, but beautiful aerial footage.  Those parts of the movie deserve 5+ stars.",1293753600,,188,4.84375
2620232,3,B000GW8UBS,"Sky Fighters is essentially a French version of Top Gun.  It's a rousing military adventure, following two pilots in the French air force, as they deal with stolen aircraft, betrayals within their own department, and battles with terrorists.  The plot is rather convoluted.  After a failed operation, in which a plane is intercepted and shot down under suspicious circumstances, the pilots are court-martialed on trumped up charges.  They are offered a chance for reinstatement if they agree to a dangerous secret mission.  In the process, they uncover both a terrorist plot and corrupt business dealings on the part of government officials.  They are taken prisoner in the Libyan desert and nearly shot, before staging a daring escape, and valiantly defeating the terrorists in the sky.  The pacing is extremely fast, so that it can take two viewings to follow the twists and turns in the plot.  The film works best in a visual sense, with gripping scenes of aerial combat.  This edition is available both in French, with English subtitles, and in English; it works better in the original French.",1260748800,3,1097,5.05
2620233,2,B000GW8UBS,"I got this originally for the air scenes.
Well it wasn't even worth the price for those as they were few and far between.
Plot was lame.
Waste of money.

2620234,4,B000GW8UBS,"I should begin by saying I have a querky style and I am an aviation nut, so movies that portray aviation will always get my attention. That said, I was more a fan of Iron Eagle than Top Gun in the 80's, and though this movie and Top Gun are oft mentioned together I think it sits neatly between Top Gun and Iron Eagle, and I liked Sky Fighters (or as I originally saw it, Les Chevaliers du ciel) a whole lot better. It certainly bests the recent film ""Stealth"" (which I saw, and consider a C- grade movie)

The story is somewhat thin, but at the same time not so far fetched; The attempted theft of a combat aircraft involves two of France's best pilots (wouldn't be a movie if they weren't)in a fairly complex terrorist plot. It also does not have a lot of air combat, dogfights, or stuff going 'ka-boom!' but it didn't bother me.

The acting was passable, and as they are European, I had no prior exposure to taint my opinion of them. The leads were just a bit more believable as pilots to me than Cruise and Kilmer

The places where the movie strays from a ""paint by numbers"" formula and towards goodness, are in the twists writer, Gilles Malenon added to the story, the time spent showing the main characters, ""Walk'n"" and ""Fahrenheit"" in situations outside of the cockpit, keeping other characters from just being action movies cliches; and the director(Grard Pirs)'s  attention to all the little details.

This film has some of (if not) the best flight, and aerial photography in an action movie. The jets and the actors' reactions in the cockpits were superb and believable and the little things that aficionados or real pilots would expect (or miss if they were left out) are there, and all of it truly sells the film's more exciting set pieces.

I abhor the term ""popcorn movie"" but as a thin guilty pleasure experience, this is definitely in my top ten, --so much so that I tracked the this film, and was very disappointed when it was not originally slated to be put out on a DVD outside of France or subtitled. I was willing to purchase the French DVD and settle for having my  cousin from Canada translate it for me (I do not know or speak French) but when I came across this on Amazon, I was on cloud nine, (bad)pun intended.

I recommend this movie highly. If you like action movies involving combat jets you have to at least see this movie once.",1236124800,8,2360,4.4467592592592595
2620235,5,B000GW8UBS,"So the story isn't as good as TopGun, but it's good and it has unbelievable flying video, and a lot of it. youtube some of the videos, and you'll see; and wanna buy it. It's absolutely amazing to watch, you'll wish you could fly!",1231718400,,229,4.2272727272727275
2620236,1,B000GW8UBS,"Forget about the plot (which could be confused with a porno), and you'll enjoy this film. The real stars of this movie are the airplanes and the excellent flying sequences. The women in this testosterone charged flick are as usual, treated like adult film stars so guys if your planning a bachelor party, you might want to sneak a peek. I'd recommend this movie as a Saturday night appetizer before viewing TOP GUN or BEHIND ENEMY LINES.",1209686400,,437,4.688311688311688

8134877,4,B000GW8UBS,"Awesome movie, especially on the visuals, special effects, and actual flight combat sequences. The only reason that I didn't give it a full 5 star rating is because the subtitles are limited to only French, with German being the spoken dialogue. Other than that you can follow the storyline, even if you don't speak either language, and the action, soundtrack and scenery make up for such a minor detail.",1505779200,,404,4.869565217391305

Joe kind of movie (not referring to the recent movies based on that), where the pilots are all over the place in various roles, a plot involving terrorists and government double-agents, and with silly witty dialogue.
