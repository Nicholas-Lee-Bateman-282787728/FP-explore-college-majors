2611214,1,B000GH3CBQ,"I am at a loss really to describe this workout.  It stinks.  This is a very easy workout for starter's so definitly NOT for an intermediate/advanced exerciser.

Kathy Smith has tried to be 'cool and hip' by making this workout just plain weird.  She is working out but she is super imposed onto various backgrounds and this gets to be very annoying because the backgrounds change frequently.  It really is hard to describe but it seriously gave me a headache from the constant lights flashing.  Oh, and there are two segments where she even has light flashing like a strobe light effect and you're left wondering, why???

To sum it up, if the Hollister stores ever sold a teen workout, this would be it only they'd need to ramp up the volume 20 fold.

I'm telling you this is the weirdest thing I've seen come from a noted workout instructor.",1170201600,28,842,4.566666666666666
2611215,4,B000GH3CBQ,This one really works and is easy to follow.  Some of Kathy's workouts feel more like learning dance routines.  This one is easy to follow and I especially like the addition of the light weights.  I feel like I am getting a little strength training along with the cardio workout.,1170115200,4,279,4.54
2611216,4,B000GH3CBQ,"This is a great walking video.  It is good for in-between days because it isn't too tough, but it does get your heart going.  There is also the option of doing only one segment (about 30 min) or doing the entire workout(60 min.).  Kathy Smith is always fun with great instruction.",1168819200,6,280,4.450980392156863
2611217,4,B000GH3CBQ,"Tried this one for the first time today.  I was expecting regular walking with side steps, kick backs etc, a la leslie Sansone--NOooo not this one--The main walking segment consists of jogging like movements with weighted arm swings/movements.  It was fun and fast and the scenery was beautiful, At times Kathy had a little trouble keeping time but other than that this is an advanced walking workout.  The standing abs section was innovative and doable.  The other 10 minute walking session did not use weights but it was intense. The exercisors were pretty young things--I found them to be motivating and their youth did not detract from the workout in any way. I would definitely do this one again.  It was fun and I felt like I burned more calories with this faster pace than with Leslie. 3 pound weights are enough resistance with all of the overhead moves.",1167609600,34,862,4.758389261744966
2611218,5,B000GH3CBQ,"I LOVE this workout!! It is fun,innovative and brilliantly led by beautiful Kathy Smith!! I usually stick to walking workouts by Leslie Sansone but this is a great addition to my program and adds some much needed variety. While I wish she would have added some older,less fit companions to this workout,none of them were in any way annoying.

  Kathy is living proof that walking is truly the best all around cardio workout,whether indoors or out. I love her Matrix Method and this is a great workout when combined with her Matrix Method Ultimate Sculpt.

  I really hope to see more indoor walking programs from her in the future. This one is awesome!!!",1167350400,8,654,4.743362831858407
2611219,4,B000GH3CBQ,"I received the DVD yesterday and have already done it twice. The moves, music and Kathy are so much fun that I couldn't wait to try it again. The moves are easy to learn (even if you aren't particularly well-coordinated). After doing all the exercises, I felt that I had had a great work-out involving most of my muscle groups. I found the background scenery a little cheesy, but that does not interfere with the work-out at all. An excellent work-out from Kathy Smith!",1167177600,12,469,4.595238095238095
2611220,4,B000GH3CBQ,"Over the years I have used so many of Kathy's workouts I can't even count them.  This workout is another great one by Kathy...I truly enjoy it, and her back-up cast is good as well.  It's easy to learn and is a good solid workout.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that Kathy herself acts a little odd.  She is normally so composed and classy, and I just feel in this workout she acted a little, I don't know, silly I guess is the word.  Her instructions were clear as always, but her actions & occasional yelping get to be a little distracting.  However, it is a good enough workout to make it worth overlooking the few times that happens.",1166572800,8,651,4.209677419354839
2611221,5,B000GH3CBQ,"I really enjoyed the ""matrix"" moves in this workout - you walk moving your right leg to 12:00 and back, then 2:00 and back, then 3:00 and back, then 4:00 and back - then the same with the left leg.  This reminded me of Latin dance, especially the merengue.  She also uses weights and different arm movement to sculpt the upper body while walking.  I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone, and this was a much more energetic and fun take on the walking craze.  On the other hand, Kathy seems to be trying to capture the younger crowd as she has dumped her usual exercise partners for two guys and two gals who can't be more then 23, and has opted for some weird pulsing camera cuts.  Thankfully, this does not distract from getting an excellent walking workout.  Kathy looks GREAT for her age (she looks great, period), but gets a little befuddled during the workout, like she doesn't remember what ""time"" we are placing the foot, or if we are on the right or left - but these are just verbal errors, nothing to interfere with the workout - in fact, it's sorta nice to see her showing her age a little! :-)  She even says that if we are finished, we can ""fast forward"" - then she says, ""not fast forward, those were the old days!""  All in all, I am VERY HAPPY with this DVD, which is broken down into one 30-minute walk, one 10-minute walk, one 10-minute core area, and on stretch.  Kathy, you still rock!",1165622400,65,1397,4.301526717557252
2611222,4,B000GH3CBQ,"I was initially hesitant to order a ""walking"" workout - I've been exercising for many years, and though I am getting older and creakier, I thought a walking DVD would be way too easy.  This one was much better than I expected.

It's broken down into a 30-minute walking workout, an extra 10 minute workout that's similar, if the 30 minutes wasn't enough for you, and then a cool down.  There's also a 10 minute core conditioning segment that I haven't done yet.

In the main workout, you walk throughout, with various arm movements incorporated.  There are periods where you can use light hand weights; I like these, because it feels like I'm working my entire body.  Most of the weighted arm movements target the abs as well, which I also like.  And though neither Kathy, nor none of her very young background pals, modify the workout, you can keep it low impact if you like.  For higher impact, there are sections where you're kind of prancing in place or side-to-side/forward-back, instead of just walking.

The background, the clothes on Kathy and her 4 helpers, all of it is kind of corny and a bit distracting at first, but it quickly stopped bothering me.  In fact, it's nice to see something that isn't your typical gym/workout room with everyone in sports bras and short shorts.

Overall, I'd recommend for those who don't feel they need to do Insanity or P90X to feel they've gotten a workout.",1422835200,,1403,4.662601626016261
2611223,5,B000GH3CBQ,I could lose weight if I used this method. :),1419897600,,45,3.6
2611224,2,B000GH3CBQ,I couldn't get into this one too good,1416182400,,37,3.75
2611225,1,B000GH3CBQ,"I have several KS DVDs and thought I'd give this one a try. I hated this one for many reasons: first, the camera work and backgrounds are look like an team of amateurs produced it. She's actually alone in a studio in front of a screen that flashes a group of staffers and different background. The matrix method is moving using clock positions but it's unintentionally hilarious because whoever was doing the CGI has the clock upside down. When Kathy says put your hands at the 2:00 position, the clock shows the 4:00 position. The 12:00 matrix on the screen shows at the 6:00 position at the bottom. In some of the screen shots, the group is superimposed against changing foregrounds but the fuzzy, cartoonish quality is annoying and distracting. Hilarious if it wasn't so pitiful that I paid for this. If you are looking for a power walk, try looking elsewhere because this DVD is awful. Sorry Kathy, you have some great DVDs but this is so poorly produced and edited that it it a joke: on you and on the poor fans that will buy this b/c it has your name.",1392336000,3,1057,4.481865284974093
2611226,5,B000GH3CBQ,"It's a very fun aerobic workout. I go through it very fast because it's varied and really enjoyable. I like the added bits of strenght and core training, nothing too strenuous but a good nudge. And one can always up the weights :)",1386979200,,230,4.372093023255814
2611227,5,B000GH3CBQ,Nice walking workout. I especially like the added weight in the workout. Not too difficult for a 60 yr old. Nice special effects; outdoor walking. good price fast delivery.,1365465600,,172,4.9655172413793105
2611228,5,B000GH3CBQ,"This DVD is a riot. It looks as though Kathy and her crew of healthy looking young people are out in the California desert, somewhere in the Mojave Desert would be my guess. There's a hiking/Western theme, with everyone wearing outdoor clothes and, occasionally, cowboy hats. Cute use of green screen places them in different desert locales including a barn, a water tower, a grove of joshua trees, and an outdoor movie screen. This is not distracting; it's quite entertaining.

The workout is excellent; easy to follow, different, and fun. Walk I is a walk of about 30 minutes with intervals using weights. You can use any kind of weight, or none at all. Good core moves, as well as a sprightly sweat-inducing walk. Walking II is ten minutes of fast walking. Core Conditioning consists of excellent standing exercises for that blasted muffin-top. As someone who tends to do neck-ups (as opposed to sit-ups)on the floor, these are terrific. There's no learning curve to the moves, and anyway, I always think of what Leslie Sansone says: ""You can't do it wrong!""

I'm keeping my eyes peeled for more Kathy Smith dvds with this format. Power Walk for Weight Loss is fun and different and I highly recommend it. You'll look forward to popping it in your player.",1348531200,3,1258,4.792626728110599
2611229,1,B000GH3CBQ,"I have several of Kathy Smith's excercise video's. I work out almost every day and use a different excercise video from Kathy and many other fitness people, so I have a large collection. I bought this one in a $2 bucket at Ocean State Job Lot, watched it this morning and was shocked at how badly it was produced. The screen/scene changes and flashes, zooming in and out quickly, makes the people on the screen look out of proportion, and is extremely annoying to watch.  After using it once, I have no interest in using it again. The workout itself was pretty bad as well.  She must have been having a bad day, as her comments are dumb, and everything about it is just poor quality. No wonder it was on clearance at the store.",1340064000,,727,4.377777777777778
2611230,5,B000GH3CBQ,Excuse the delay in review. I have received and thank you for a good item. I want intend to buy something from you again.,1320105600,,121,4.083333333333333
2611231,1,B000GH3CBQ,"This is the worst walking DVD I have ever bought. The background is annoying, and the music is lame. There isn't much walking either. To much strange foot work, and flapping the arms.(or swatting flies as they call it in the workout) Don't waist your money.",1305331200,2,257,4.608695652173913
2611232,2,B000GH3CBQ,"After Christmas I purchased several DVDs in an effort to add variety to my walking routines.  Of the DVDs I purchased, this is my least favorite.  I found the matrix thing gimmicky, and ineffective.  Perhaps I am just a klutz, but also found that many of the ""steps"" were impossible to do and added nothing to the workout.  The background was beautiful, at least at first, and the people in the DVD were too.  They seemed to have no problem with the steps, but that did not help me.  There were other ""gimmicks"" with the background, such as putting it on a billboard, side of a train, etc.  As you can tell,  I got distracted by elements of the DVD which did not add to the effectiveness of the workout.  I do not use this one and feel it was a waste of money.  Nice location and hat.",1295568000,5,784,4.236486486486487
2611233,1,B000GH3CBQ,"This workout is just dumb.  The cuing is awful and the set is worse.  The only reason I bought it was because it was cheap, but it is seriously so ridiculous that I couldn't even finish it once.  If you want a great walking workout look for Leslie Sansone dvd's.",1289865600,4,262,4.2
2611234,4,B000GH3CBQ,"I am so grateful that I remembered the good reviews when I saw this in Marshall's and picked it up. This is an upbeat, energetic 30-minute walking workout with the option to add light hand weights if you feel like upping your effort that day. You also have the option to add on either, or both, of the two 10-minute workouts (fast walk and core).

I am choreography-challenged and don't like walking workouts that have too much of a dance element. The matrix (clock) system was simple and engaging. The cowboy hats, outdoor backdrops and Kathy's rebel yells were not enough to spoil the workout for me, it just has too many positive factors: chapter options, intervals, and no dread factor. This one's a keeper!",1285545600,3,711,4.688
2611235,2,B000GH3CBQ,"THis video was too hard to keep up with guide. It is not your ordinary ""walking"" video. It is too hard for beginners.",1284336000,2,117,4.130434782608695
2611236,1,B000GH3CBQ,"Ahhhhhhhhhh! Can't stand looking at her, and it seems like she isn't really with the other people. Horrible layout and just couldn't get used to it. My heart rate didn't stay up and i just went back to doing my favorite Leslie Sansone DVD after fiddling with this horrible video. UGH,but at least it was cheap and came on time. Kathy is just old and saggy looking and way too skinny so i didn't like looking at her and her attitude is so darn annoying. no more Kathy Smith for me i guess. I liked her older stuff,but they are most likely on tape",1278460800,2,545,4.25
2611237,4,B000GH3CBQ,"I would walk three miles a day at a fast pace and would never break a sweat! With this dvd, not only did I break a sweat, but,I began to tone my body. Imagine that, having fun, while walking in the rain, snow, or whatever the weather. It's and inside walk and you don't need much space. It's almost like having Kathy right there with you as you are walking. A friend suggested this DVD, and I have never been more grateful! It's very low impact but high energy. You may want to buy some weights, but even that is not absolutely necessary. This is my second purchase. The first one was later given to my daughter. With children, and a busy schedule, I really felt that she could squeeze in a half hour of walking in place. She and the kids loved it! Hey, you can even do the routine while looking at your favorite SOAP. Multi-tasking, what fun!",1277510400,5,843,4.275
2611238,2,B000GH3CBQ,"I got this to switch it up from Leslie Sansone (who I think is great)...but was a little disappointed, not the worst but a little bored with it....I'll stick to Leslie Sansone....",1277078400,2,179,4.625
2611239,1,B000GH3CBQ,"This is one of the strangest exercise DVDs I have every owned, and I own a lot of videos and DVDs. The bizarre camera work and background/green screen stuff is very distracting. I agree, Kathy's yee hawing is over the top, and doesn't even fit into what is going on; very forced.  Maybe she yells because her Daisy Duke outfit is as painful as it look.

The actual workout itself is mediocre at best.  The cuing is a disaster and Kathy is never in synch with the music.  It is like she was listening to a different soundtrack when making this video.  That is EXTREMELY distracting to me.  Worst part of all, as soon as you actually get your heart rate up and get moving she stops and does some middling toning moves.  To add insult to injury, the whole thing is under 30 minutes long.

If you want a good, solid walking workout, do Leslie Sansone DVD with 12 minute miles and add hand weights.  It won't be as flashy, but it will be much more deserving of your time and effort.  Don't waste your money on this  DVD, it is a total dog.",1269129600,3,1034,4.251282051282051
2611240,4,B000GH3CBQ,"When I first purchased this DVD approx 3 years ago, I have to admit I agreed with the reviewers that have described this as cheesy and corny. Recently I blew the dust of a few DVDs to add some variety and was pleasantly surprised when I gave this one a ""second chance.""
Yes, Kathy is chatty, but that's how she is, she's personable and fun! Yes, her fellow exercisers are young but...who really cares? They're obviously having fun and show some personality. and yes, oh yes, the strobing effects and superimpostion is a bit different but it certainly doesn't retract from the overall workout. Kathy makes a few mistakes but once you know the routine it doesn't matter.
The workout itself is not really intense I usually do it after a few other more high intensity dvds. But the combination of cardio and toning is nice and the standing core work offers a nice change of pace to doing crunches or using a core ball.",1266624000,,914,4.545454545454546
2611241,4,B000GH3CBQ,"This work out was pretty good.  She has 2 workouts on this using weights which I like but think they could have made this simply 1 full workout.

This does get you sweating but not high impact.

I'm not sure if I really care for the set or the clothes for that matter.  Everyone is ""dressed up"" in cowboy gear khaki shorts and tanks, with hats and  Kathy is wearing a plaid sleeveless shirt and khaki shorts.  Hardly seems like work out gear but I guess that is what they were going for.",1258416000,,487,4.182795698924731
2611242,5,B000GH3CBQ,"This is a really great exercise dvd. I never tire of this workout, which can be easily modified to whatever level you feel like. Kathy Smith's friendly, energetic and non-judgmental style gets me going even when I am not in the mood, and really makes me feel like I am right there ""in"" the class.",1257724800,2,296,4.4
2611243,3,B000GH3CBQ,"Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, what were you thinking?  I am a huge Kathy Smith fan and have almost all of her DVDs.  This one has amateur production and choreography and incredibly hokey outfits.  If you can get past all of this, the workout itself is solid, though boring at times.  The Matrix method is wonderful and you can tailor this workout to your fitness level.",1257292800,2,360,4.578125
2611244,5,B000GH3CBQ,"I'm an avid Leslie Sansone user. I love her dvd's but I have to admit, I get a little tired of the chattiness. Plus, I feel like i'm ready to move on a bit. I don't like dancy-workouts. I don't want to think that hard! :) I was tired of just marching in place.

The reason I bought this was the other reviews. I don't think anyone said how fun it was! Not complicated. I was sweating profusely by minute 10 but I felt energized not tired. It was a really fun workout. The stretching part at the end is wonderful! So relaxing.

I really felt this workout the next morning. I've never been sore in my ribs, sides and abs from just doing my Walk at Home workouts. It's a good sore, feels like I worked out for real!
I used 3lb weights for the strength training part. I'm of two minds of this - we did a lot of 'pick up your weights', 'put your weights down', 'ok, pick up your weights again'. I kind of wish we'd just do the weight section and go on but I guess it's interval training and I won't complain since I am feeling good results.

The next thing that I was nervous about is my knees. I didn't want to do a bunch of squats and lunges. I just can't take it. None of that here except that moving in the clock rotations works every part of your legs, hips and buns. I felt the burn without feeling my ligaments crack and strain. So low to moderate impact. I would recommend this is you're ready to move on from Leslie but not wanting to do something like Boot Camp or The Firm.

I thought at first the crew behind her was going to annoy me but they did not. They were quite fun to watch and I felt myself getting a little 'attitude' along with them. Lots of smiles and serious sweating. Even the men were having a good time and I appreciate watching their cheerfullness.

The most positive thing I have to say is that I can't wait to do it again!!!",1254355200,3,1850,4.099447513812155
2611245,5,B000GH3CBQ,"I really enjoyed this workout for several reasons.  I was completely sweating after I finished- so I know I burned a ton of calories.  It works your abs throughout the workout, and there's a separate core section at the end that is phenomenal.  All of the core work is standing.  The stretching portion at the end is also really good.  If you're looking for a great walking dvd with some variety- make this purchase.  I have been a longtime Kathy Smith fan, and she keeps delivering.",1250035200,2,483,4.558139534883721
2611246,4,B000GH3CBQ,"I agree with the previous reviewer, for the price, this is a nice addition to your walking (cardio) DVD library. Yes, I have Leslie Sansone, Denise Austin bootcamp, Chris Freytag - Prevention, etc. I checked out other KS cardio DVD's and felt they were too fluffy or had too much choreography. I need some repetition, cues to the next movement,and much prefer low impact with a few high impact moves. Surprisingly, this DVD does that.
But if you can get past the cheesy sets and a few whoops and hollering, this workout will get your heart rate pumping (the real purpose) and moves that you will not get when you go walking or running in the park. Walking and running are single moves, in this DVD, you are constantly doing compound moves upper and lower. In addition to moving your legs side to side and in the clockwise moves Kathy is doing...you don't do those types of moves walking the park.  I wish she would come out with another walking DVD.",1250035200,3,949,4.549707602339181
2611247,3,B000GH3CBQ,"I've only done the workout once, but so far, I agree with both the positive and the negative points of many other reviewers.

Positive:
I thought that this was decent workout, but quite easy. My heart rate did get up somewhat, but not as high as my regular workouts. There is a short section at the end of the cardio piece where they pick up the pace and jog a bit.  Then there is a more intense piece of cardio that is mostly jumping around. This is a good workout for me on a slow day, when I don't feel like working out too hard.

Negative:
I actually did the workout with the sound turned down (I was watching tv).  I do quite a lot of aerobic dance, so don't really need the cuing. So, I can't really comment on the synchro with the music. However, there are definitely some awkward bits where everyone doesn't seem to be moving together.  I also do think that Kathy Smith is overly peppy and looks sillier than the people in the background. The worst thing, though, was the editing and production of the DVD. There are many very rapid edits that flash annoyingly. It actually made me kind of ill at times. And the backgrounds are just plain bad most of the time, but the worst is when they have the participants ""projected"" on the side of what looks to be a corrugated metal water tower. Because of the corrugation, it's actually hard to see what's going on.

So I will continue to use this DVD, as I said on slower, lazier days. But, if you're looking for an intense workout or if you're looking for a purely walking workout (no jogging or jumping), then this workout is probably not for you.",1249948800,2,1599,4.331103678929765
2611248,5,B000GH3CBQ,"I decided long ago I should cancel my gym membership and spend the money on dvds just because I'm more likely to workout at home. Because of that, I've built up a fairly decent collection to compare. This is a great one!

Instuctor: I think an instructor can vary via the routine. I totally panned another one of Kathy's dvds because she was hard to follow and the cueing was bad. Not so in this one. This is really the first dvd I've seen that truly stretches as a 5 star dvd for both a beginner to an advanced fitness person using the same moves...because the calorie burn is high (I'll go into that in a minute), it keeps your interest, but the moves and cueing aren't so complicated that you need a dance degree to follow them...you will pick them up without having to use your ""rewind"" button to do so. so both a beginner and advanced will enjoy it and get a great return.

caloric burn: And isn't this what matters most? I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn...and I only mention this becaiuse what I say is not based upon perceived exertion but measured exertion...I burned a high number of calories during this workout...it gets an A plus on what it's meant to do, yet it does so without FEELING difficult. Big plus. Burned more than during many of my other cardio dvds.

Moves: You'll burn the calories by simple steps and arm movements but not lots of squats and things that may hurt the joints or knees of a beginner. (squat moves aren't a problem for me but I know they are for some and, in all honesty, it's nice to have a routine that doesn't focus totally on those since so many already do. It's different and works you out without stressing out joints, much like an elliptical does!) It's a decent cardio routine and may even make you replace any outside walks where you can't do the arm movements to double your caloric burn without looking crazy outside--indoors you can follow on increasing your burn through the arm movements she shows that double your burn!

set: It's pretty cool how they added interest to the set...but also hard to explain. Kathy goes from in front of a screen with her crew on this enormous screen behind her in a canyon setting, to sometimes them both being on screen...It's pretty clever and pretty cool and a pretty setting.

Energy: high but, unlike the last dvd I hated of Kathy's she doesn't have her chorus behind her hooping and yelling for no reason. That was a relief. She's toned down the unneeded yelps and kept the energy high to motivate in my opinion

price: for such a solid dvd this is a steal. I will be honest, it's the only reason why I bought it. I mentioned already that Kathy doesn't always put forth 5 star dvds for me (she may be perfect for others...I just can't always follow her) so it was a risk, but both a fitness magazine and 2 people in a class I teach gave it a positive review so I thought perhaps this one was different...

and it was!

whether you are looking to get started in a workout routine, looking for an alternative to walking outside when it's rainy, cold, hot or grows boring, or whether you are ready to boost your caloric burn because you'd just been walking but not doing ab moves and arm moves to double your return and caloric burn, or whether you always workout inside but want a good solid cardio routine that's interesting, has good instruction, and will burn that fat faster than many out there...

this is a agood one!",1249776000,11,3430,4.431746031746032

There is an arrow pointer that pops up on the TV (for a few seconds) and shows exactly which area to walk on (where is 2 o'clock or where is 10 o'clock etc.) I pretty much got the hang out it in a few minutes. What I like about this walk is that you just don't do forward walks or backward walks or sideward walks. There are walks that you do on a certain angle and that helps tone the thighs. I didn't give this the full 5 stars because Kathy is kinda cheesy and  hyper in in some instances and she says some kinda strange things like power walk and  imagine that you want to get that chocolate ice cream after your walk or do a bump walk like you want to say ""hey there"" to your boyfriend.

I tried many other dvds, Biggest Loser, etc. but they ALL incorporate squats and lunges. I'm still heavy and I have a painful Achilles Tendon and must be careful with my knees and tendons and I can't do 15 minutes of squats and lunges. This workout gets my heart rate up and incorporates good core moves. It is a little weird with the pulsating and superimposing Kathy's image, and the safari clothes, but I like it.

This video is very different from most of my exercise workouts.  The settings change frequently, which sometimes makes the movement seem out of time with the music.  That being said, the workout itself is vigorous and enjoyable.
There are three points in the video that annoy me.  One is where Kathy is getting overly enthusiastic and yells, banshee style.  The other two times are when they use a 'flash' transition to signal a change in movement--makes me feel like I'm about to seize.

It wasn't fun, but it was necessary, and you had to do everything exactly like they say.  Smiles are rare and usually just for show, not because they're having fun.  You can tell they're so focused on doing everything ""just so"" that they obliterate any fun I might have interjected myself.
I hadn't used Kathy Smith's stuff since I had a 33rpm record of her and pictures to help me figure out what she was doing. :)  In rediscovering Kathy, what I found was that I NEED someone with her energy, happiness, and easy-going nature to make exercise FUN AGAIN!  She tells you how to get the most out of the moves, sure; but she's more concerned that you're up, and moving, and having fun, than that you do everything ""exactly"" as she does it.  As a result, my ""Core"" is tightening up (with no sit-ups), I have more energy all day long, I feel happier and more focused, AND I'm losing weight!

I will definitely but this back into rotation along with the Tae Bo Bootcamp, Amped, and my Leslie Sansone.

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and felt that I had gotten a great workout when finished, without feeling exhausted.

Though I agree that the way the workout is filmed (with Kathy and the other exercisers superimposed over different backgrounds and a few instances of strange flashing lights) was a little disconcerting at first, I didn't find that the style distracted from the workout, and was completely used to it by the end of the DVD.

As for unusual arm movements, such as ""swatting flies,"" Kathy makes it clear that users can choose any arm movements they feel comfortable with during this part of the workout, but the point is to keep it lighthearted and fun!

The ""Matrix Method"" Kathy refers to during the workout was a great way for me to visualize and understand what we were supposed to be doing.

Overall, the workout is fun and invigorating, with ample opportunities to  make it harder or easier, depending on the extent to which you choose to exert yourself, by walking, ""prancing,"" or jogging though the exercises. I actually liked this workout much more than I do Kathy's ""Ultimate Sculpt"" workout, the other in her ""Matrix"" series, as it was much easier on my knees, although I will continue to do both workouts, on alternate days.",1205107200,,1502,4.783783783783784

I thouhgt this work out was fun but I did get a little more winded then I do with Leslie's work-outs. The variation was great with all the twisting and turning and using the hand weights and then putting them down for a power march. I didn't do the 10 minute walk on the DVD yet but I did do the stretch and cool down. The stretch and cool down was easy with a few different moves that I have never seen but it felt good stretching everything out while on the floor to standing up rather then just a few deep breaths and a calf stretch that Leslie's cool downs consist of.

Kathy is also a bit annoying in this one - when she makes that yelling sound like a crazed banshee - it makes me cringe.  Kathy you look great, you're a fitness diva - why on earth did you have to make this video with these corny background changes?  And don't even get me started on the background walkers - how old are they anyway??? Do you really expect me to believe these guys actually do your workout dvd's? P.S. their form is also AWFUL.

And that core training really works; you can feel your abs working as you pull & twist etc. Sometimes the arm movements they do with some of the leg movements throw me off a bit, but like Kathy says, if it doesn't feel right, then make up your own movements to do with them. Also, it's great that it breaks the workout into sections, so depending on how much time you have, you can do one of the two ten minute segments (or both), or you can just do the 30 minute segment, or you can do them altogether + the cool down (for a total of 60 minutes).

I found Kathy Smith to be a little off her game in this one.  I know she is trying to be encouraging but I don't like it when she actually screeches.  Another problem is the set -- there are a couple of times when two of her fellow walkers, on either end, are totally cut off by the columns on either side of the set.  I know it sounds like I'm being overly critical, but believe me, do the workout a couple of times and you might well agree.  As long as I'm complaining, I might as well mention that since K.Smith is getting older and this walking tape more than likely appeals to an older person as well, that she use older people to work out with instead of 20 something year olds.",1172102400,4,818,4.0246913580246915

Minuses:

- it is way to easy - good for beginners or maybe for your not-so-fit days. I didn't even get warm.

- Kathy is a bit annoying with her 'I'm loving it!', 'Isn't it fun?', 'I'm having so much fun!' etc.

- everyone is working on the same level - well she says you can improvise your hand movements when you're working 'the clock', but nothing more really. Sometimes you can't even see the entire cast!

- I liked the Matrix abs section - I could feel my muscles working

On a technical level, this is a solid intermediate walking/low impact workout with a fantastic standing core section. Kathy uses light weights which generally assist in raising the intensity (as opposed to hardcore muscle sculpting). The workout makes a great calorie burner.

On an aesthetic level, I absolutely love the creative way Kathy has outdoor scenery changing behind her during the programme. The time just flies by! It might not be to everyone's liking, but I simply LOVE it! Since doing this (and Kathy's Matrix Sculpt workout) every other workout dvd looks very bland in comparison!

If you're at all used to Leslie Sansone videos, you will NOT be getting what you consider to be a ""walking"" workout.  This is far more aerobic-esque and dance-ish.  Second, there are numerous spots in the video where the beat and the steps simply don't match up.  I would argue that the music was poorly chosen, as it even appears impossible for Kathy herself to follow on a beat.  I think a young teen would like this video, but it won't make my rotation...which is disappointing because I actually like several of Kathy's other videos.",1170374400,8,648,4.591304347826087

8132093,4,B000GH3CBQ,"This DVD workout is a little bit out of the ordinary. It has the personality of a cowgirl and the music of a electronica DJ. I will say Kathy Smith looks pretty darn cute in a cowboy hat. This workout is very active and will make you sweat and maybe even get a little out of breath. Keep a bottle of water nearby.

Now as far as creativity goes this is off the charts. I mean scenes change with rapid frequency so you are never bored. Some of the sets look a little small for five people. Now and then the people exercising are not fully seen as they are behind a set piece. It looks like part of this was filmed outside and part in a studio. But it is all made to look like it is outdoors in the desert.

This has four main segments which can be done all together although I don't suggest you do it that way. Maybe take one day and do the 29 minute workout, do the 13 minute walking workout another day and do core exercises on a separate day too. I say this because some of the moves are repeated in each workout. You may however want to do the stretching exercises each time you workout.

What I liked was that the music is by Daveed. I thought: ""Wait I've heard this music before someplace."" The music is not overbearing like most dance music. It is very motivating but not irritating at all.

I'd suggest you rent this before you buy it as it is the most unique workout I've ever tried. Would I do it again? Sure Kathy is the cutest and I have yet to do a workout by her that I didn't at least like. She infuses this workout with her super fun personality.

8132094,5,B000GH3CBQ,"The first time I tried this DVD, about five years ago, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It felt a little hokey, and it features camera work that seemed odd at the time.  Over the years, it has grown on me. Even though the title says ""power walk,"" I find it to be more of a low impact cardio workout. The addition of light hand weights and standing ""crunchless abs"" exercises make it a well rounded, low impact routine that gets your heart rate up and works your whole body.

Fast forward a few years and a few dozen more exercise videos under my belt, and I love it more and more. I need good music in a workout and am finding that the music in DVDs lately is all annoying electronica that makes me want to rip the DVD out. The music here is by Daveed, known for his enjoyable compilations in many yoga and Pilates DVDs.

The backdrop isn't a work out studio but the desert. It looks like it was filmed on location outdoors. Kathy invited 4 young adults to walk with her--two guys and two girls. They wear white cotton shirts with khaki shorts so not your normal exercise attire. This DVD keeps my interest and thus motivates me to put it in the DVD player and get moving. It's challenging enough for a work out but not so much that you end up sitting on the couch watching her finish (like some other DVD's I have).  I like that it's in 3 segments (basic workout, higher level workout and cool down) so you can customize it for what you have time and energy to do. I can finish this one to the end. I also have her Latin Rhythm Dance Workout DVD. It's fun but way more difficult to follow. If you can walk and move your arms, you can do the Matrix Method. She also has you use weights that help transform muscle tone. The weights are optional and are not included with the DVD. I use 3 lb weights. If you're younger and really like to push yourself when you workout, this is probably not the best fit for you. I think you'd get bored and not think it was effective. It's perfect for me at age 53.
