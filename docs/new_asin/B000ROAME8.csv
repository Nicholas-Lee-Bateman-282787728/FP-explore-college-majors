8201875,5,B000ROAME8,"I bought this movie mainly for Two Came Back because I've never heard of A Nightmare Came True but I have to admit I new I was going to love Two Came back because it's based off an amazing true story and it's just a great movie!!! A Nightmare Came True, to my surprise was excellent as well!! It's a great mystery/twisted ending kind of movie and you have to love a very young Jeremy Renner. :) He's hilarious.",1415923200,2,410,4.2025316455696204
8201876,5,B000ROAME8,I'm a big fan of Melissa Joan Hart.  I really enjoyed watching this movie on TV. Was glad to find the movie Two came back on DVD.,1379289600,,129,3.7777777777777777
8201877,5,B000ROAME8,"This movie I have wanted for a long time. Very Hard to find (I intended to purchase Two Came Back) but it appears it was only avaialable in two movie DVD format. I am a HUGE Jonathan Brandis Fan and this was an offer not to be passed on. First time I have also viewed the film, wonderful...I have to say it is for fans of Hart and Brandis only really. Region Coding was not an issue for my machine, however, (as I am in Australia), this could be an issue for some...be weary that the DVD Region may not be playable in your country. A Great Drama also for lovers of the genre but as above true Jon fans unite!!",1254441600,4,609,4.041322314049586
