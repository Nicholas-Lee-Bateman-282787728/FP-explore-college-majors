8430913,5,B004IN0ZWI,"Anyone and everyone who is interested in film, feminism, gender, sexuality, and/or pornography should watch this documentary.  Brilliantly done.  It begins with interviews of well-known early feminist pornographers, mostly in the US, and steadily marches toward the contemporary feminist/genderqueer porn/erotica scene in Europe.  The historical approach helps contextualize the narrative, aesthetic, and cinematic challenges that cutting edge feminist/genderqueer pornographers face.  For those of us in the US, getting an ""insider view"" into the work of those in Europe is invaluable.

This is a great film for those who teach sexuality studies, queer studies, feminist theory, and/or film studies.  It will require a ""sexually explicit material"" warning, but no book or article on this topic will provide as mileage in the classroom.",1470960000,,836,5.867768595041323

8430916,5,B004IN0ZWI,"In the interest of full disclosure, I am a long-standing fan of the filmmaker, Catherine Breillat. This documentary explores the credible and logical conclusion to the feminist revolution while exposing the gender-bias, misogyny, and genophobia that grip even a modern and enlightened society.",1442620800,,293,5.837209302325581

8430918,5,B004IN0ZWI,"covers a nice wide range of thoughts & people on feminism and pornography/erotica from the inside out by artists, activists, sex workers, pornographers and how the pro-sex movement developed. for those who care about the topic most definitely very worth seeing",1386806400,,260,5.365853658536586
8430919,1,B004IN0ZWI,This was like some Robot Chicken movie! About 15mins into the scene jumps and incoherent story I gave up and turned it off. Guess I should have read the description. Not even worthy of latenight B movie status!,1374192000,2,210,4.552631578947368
8430920,4,B004IN0ZWI,"This doc blows apart the theory that you are either feminist OR into porn/prostitution/etc.  There are at least 2 different kinds of feminism, and this film shows you the most progressive, open-minded, reality-based of the lot.  The interviews with the likes of Annie Sprinkles and her ilk are absolutely empowering.",1360972800,6,316,5.3
