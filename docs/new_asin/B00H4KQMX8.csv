6132220,3,B00H4KQMX8,"This is a bit of an odd product in this era of Blu-ray Discs and feature-packed re-releases.  Here's what the limited Amazon description (at least on the mobile app) doesn't tell you:

1. These 8 movies are dubbed in English with no other audio or subtitles.
2. These are the Fortune Star prints in widescreen format but they are not remastered.
3. The back of the DVD cover insert says they are anamorphic widescreen in NTSC Format.
4. The sound is listed as Dolby 2.0 Stereo/Mono
5. There are two discs with 4 movies each.
6. The case holds the two DVDs separately (swing-out style case).
7. The movies are in color and last approximately 815 minutes total.
8. DVD region is 0.
9. This is marketed by Shout! Factory, distributed by Timeless Media, licensed from Fortune Star.

Overall this is just a decent set of dubbed Chan flicks.  I picked it up for casual watching on Saturday afternoons.  It doesn't fit in with my ""serious"" martial arts film collection, but it's fine for what it is.",1399334400,78,992,4.581920903954802

6132233,3,B00H4KQMX8,"This review is specifically about this two-disc, eight film set.
The two discs each come in a separate ""page"" of one jewel case.

One disc contains Battle Creek Brawl, City Hunter, Crime Story, and Magnificent Bodyguards; the other disc contains Police Story, Police Story 2, Dragon Fist, and The Protector.

This is a broad sampling of Jackie's work, both as a mere actor in his early films, and as a director in later films; he directed both Police Story and Police Story 2, as well as Crime Story.  Magnificent Bodyguards and Dragon Fist are set in ancient China, and are medieval martial art costume fantasies/period pieces.  City Hunter is a live action version of a comic book.  The Protector, like the Crime and Police Stories, is a police story, but is softcore pornography.

I'm docking this set one star because of the pornography, and another, because neither of these discs include any special features or subtitle options.",1470614400,3,935,4.923566878980892

6132237,4,B00H4KQMX8,"Jackie Chan has been in a lot of movies. Would you like eight of them? Fortune Star has collected just that number into this DVD set. There are some caveats: the set includes eight movies, but only two DVDs, so video quality isn't great, extras are non-existent, and the films are presented in English only. If you're okay with that, theres a fairly diverse selection here. The lineup includes some well-known hits, some more obscure but distinctly worthwhile titles, and one or two bombs. Below are brief comments on each film. Ive included the year of release, as well as the individual run times, which I could not find on any of the packaging.

MAGNIFICENT BODYGUARDS (1978, 101 mins). From back in the days when he was still being credited as Jacky, this features Chan as Ting Chung, a kung fu fighter who is enlisted by a young woman to escort her and her sick brother through the deadly Storm Mountains. Ting Chung chooses several other skilled warriors to accompany them, and they set off on a journey full of traps and dangerous foes. This is a pretty good example of the virtues of late-70s kung fu; its broad and fun, and the fights, if typical by genre standards, highlight their nature as achievements of human physical capacity. Jackies part doesnt stand out as uniquely Chan-ish, but shows competent acting and fighting.

DRAGON FIST (1979, 94 mins). Chan plays Tang How-Yuen, a young martial artist whose master was killed in a duel. He seeks vengeance, of course, but when he finally meets his teachers killer, what he finds surprises him. This film was produced during the time when Chan was still being offered up as a potential successor to Bruce Lee, and its grim drama makes more sense when viewed in that context. With that in mind, this is a decent movie, with cinematography that takes advantage of the lush sets and complex fight sequences.

BATTLE CREEK BRAWL (1980, 95 mins). Chan plays Jerry Kwan, a young man who lives with his extended family in Chicago, including his father, a restauranteur; and his uncle, a chiropractor and martial arts instructor. Jerry is partial to the fighting arts himself, and hell need every bit of his skill when he gets on the wrong side of the local mob. Directed by Robert Clouse, who had previously directed Bruce Lee in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B000O176Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enter the Dragon</a>, this was Jackie Chans very first attempt to break into the American market. ""Brawl"" isn't an incoherent or even bad film so much as it is simply disorganized. It picks up and discards plot threads like socks, introducing them or leaving them hanging without a second thought. (This includes a lengthy but seemingly meaningless subplot about a brutal underground Roller Derby competition in which Jerry participates.) A pair of early scenesan alleyway fight and a hyperkinetic training sequenceshow off Jackies profound physical abilities and comedic gifts, but the rest of this aimless opus is missable.

THE PROTECTOR (1985, 91 mins). James Glickenhaus directed Jackie Chans second attempt to break into the American market, this stone-faced but silly cop drama featuring Chan as New York beat agent Billy Wong. When Wongs partner is killed by drug dealers, Wong vows to avenge him, but of course, his superintendent doesnt see things the same way. This movie is an odd combination of fairly thoughtful cinematography and a script that runs the gamut from Im gonna bust you down to crowd control! to Thats not a threat. Its a promise. At times its hard to tell how self-aware the film isdoes it know when its being ridiculous? ""The Protector"" is just this close to being passable entertainment; the best setting for a viewing might be a group of friends who are ready to chuckle a bit.

POLICE STORY (1985, 101 mins). Detective Sergeant Jackie Chan (guess who plays this role) is on the case of a Hong Kong drug lord, but when the kingpin successfully evades prosecutionand embarrasses Chan in the processthe DS is put on desk duty. Naturally, he takes it upon himself to set things right. This is vintage eighties Chan, meaning elaborate sets that are sure to be destroyed, outrageous stunts by the whole cast, and a sprawling plot that doesnt necessarily make much sense. This film was Jackies answer to The Protector, which was released the same year and which greatly disappointed its star; if it isn't necessarily a more coherent movie, it is certainly a better showcase for Chans talents.

POLICE STORY 2 (1988, 101 mins). Detective Sgt. Jackie Chan is back on duty after the events of the first film, but his former enemies are out for revenge. At the same time, a new threat emerges in the form of a blackmailer armed with powerful bombs. Finally, theres Jackies relationship with his long-suffering girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung) to consider. This movie has a whole lot of plot and no clear idea what to do with it. The bomber story thread is hard to follow, that involving the characters from the prior film is thin, and Mays frustration with Jackie ebbs and flows at the convenience of the script. (This is to say nothing of other sundry plot details that seem to come and go as needed.) The overloaded screenplay leaves less room for action set pieces, although there are a few decent moments here. The protracted explosion in the last three minutes is the most compelling thing in the movie, but its not worth watching the whole thing for. Unless you're attached the characters from the first ""Police Story,"" this ones probably a pass.

CRIME STORY (1993, 103 mins). Here, Jackie Chan plays Eddie Chan, a detective with the Major Crimes Unit of the Hong Kong police. When a prominent businessman is kidnapped, Chan must find the culprits and the victim, but the plot goes much deeper than he knows. This 1993 outing has similar trappings to the earlier Police Story movies, but has a darker tone and more graphic violence. In spite of one or two plot threads that seem to drop out of the film, this is a tense, well-told thriller (according to the closing credits, ostensibly based on a true story) that gives Chan a chance to show off his dramatic chops. Ambitious editing gives an additional touch of visual interest, while the atmosphere evokes Hong Kong in a surprisingly visceral way.

CITY HUNTER (1993, 105 mins). At some point in their career, be it by ill luck, bad circumstances, or favors owed, every actor makes an irredeemably awful film they just hope viewers will forgiveand then forget. It happens to the best of them, and with the anime-based ""City Hunter,"" it happens to Jackie Chan. He plays the titular character (City Hunter seems to be his actual name), an unpleasant womanizer whose main squeeze is a self-centered ingnue who, incidentally, is the daughter of his former sidekick and whom he has known (and been sworn not to seduce) since she was a small girl. The two of them get caught up in a kidnapping plot and a robbery attempt, all on a luxurious cruise ship. We could complain about the story, which seems to forget what story it is from time to time, only to remember twenty minutes later, but the movies greater flaw (and thats saying something) is its whole presentation. Most of its characters are defined by one or two obnoxious running traits (to call them running gags would be too much). Its physical comedy isn't the clever, sophisticated stuff Jackie is known for, but rather a lot of people getting hit repeatedly in the crotch, along with the occasional anime-inspired visual non-sequitur. It treats every female who appears onscreen like it was lurking outside their window at night. In short, it has none of the humor that fuels the best Chan flicks, and none of the good-heartedness that sometimes makes up the slack in his less inspired efforts. Think of this set as the Jackie Chan Seven Film Collection and forget this thing exists.

So with the abysmal exception of ""City Hunter,"" these movies range from watchable to excellent. If you can accept the bare-bones presentation, then you couldn't do better for this price.
