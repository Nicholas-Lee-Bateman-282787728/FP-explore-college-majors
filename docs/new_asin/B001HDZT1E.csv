8450678,3,B001HDZT1E,"The cartoons of Tex Avery are rated among the best of the era in which they were produced, and this DVD includes some of the best of Avery's work. Swing Shift Cinderella, Lucky Ducky and Bad Luck Blackie are really funny. Swing Shift Cinderella and the other well known Avery fairy tale cartoon, Red Hot Riding Hood, are also historically interesting with references to working women during World War II and wartime rationing. UNFORTUNATELY, the title cartoon, and one of the 10 best short films ever made in this genre, is not included in this collection. If you buy the DVD in order to watch Red Hot Riding Hood, you will be disappointed. Also missing is a cartoon showing the wolf disguised as Santa Claus (see the cover art). So, an enjoyable DVD, but with significant omissions.",1236729600,8,783,4.7226277372262775
