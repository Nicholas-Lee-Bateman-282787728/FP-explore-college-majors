1360017,5,B00004W45A,It is essential to understand self awareness to gain inner peace.  I have not heard anyone speak so knowledgably as I listen to him speak.  I have grown faster in the last year by listening to him than I have in the last 44 years.  Highly recommend!,1162425600,16,249,4.25531914893617

7924629,5,B00004W45A,"I've been a real fan of Deepak Chopra for a few years now. I can feel my life changing through the wisdom he conveys so well. He is a joy to listen to.  Just find a quiet place and listen, which is all you have to do. His lessons make ""perfect sense"".  They go beyond science and religion. Yet in a wonderful way incorporate them all.  In the end everything originates from the same loving place.  ENJOY, LEARN,GROW.",1212192000,,416,4.294871794871795
7924630,4,B00004W45A,"I  was introduced to Deepak Chopra a few years ago in ""How to know God-The Soul's Journey into the Mystery of Mysteries""-a must read by the way. I have read several of his other works and find it a bit tough going-he does tend to go on a bit I feel. Many have shared this view with me and a friend recently listened to this work on audio cd and whereas he could not come to terms with the book, thorougly enjoyed this medium. I thus caved in and followed the lazy route and got the set of DVD's as well as How to Know God. I must say I still prefer the books(therefore only the four rating) but the DVDs are great. The How to know God DVD is not a version of the book at all , so thus be carefull. One comment though, as with all his work you need to spend time thinking about what he says or else it becomes a bit of pop pshycology. Not recommended for the casual reader/listener as it gets a bit of more of the same and perhaps a bit light for the serious, advanced in reading terms, seeker but overall recommended.",1197849600,2,1017,4.034653465346534
7924631,5,B00004W45A,"I highly recommend this DVD to those searching for higher development in their lives! Deepak Chopra is one of those GREAT Teachers in Higher Learning! I truly Love his Teachings!!!Its a must have DVD!!!!!

7924632,5,B00004W45A,"I just recently purchased this Essential series and I must say that as a spiritual counselor this is truly an ""essential"" collection to anyone wanting to expand the depth of their spiritual library.  Obviously, not everyone will resonate with deepaks delivery of information, however if you do not understand the lessons he is trying to teach then you should do yourself a favor and have someone interpret this material for you.  Once you ""turn that corner"" you will be glad you did.  A great series, well done, and easy to watch over and over.",1186444800,2,544,4.76595744680851
7924633,3,B00004W45A,"First, I must say I agree with the reviewer who said, ""this current offering is high on promise and unfortunately low on the delivery of value in the form of 'how to' information and spiritual development techniques.""

Yet, my biggest complain is that this type of video does not serve well those who see Chopra for the first time. The primary reason for this is because the format is rather boring. What you find here is just a collection of his presentations, rather than a cleanly editted program. You will find many of his teachings repeated in the four different presentations.

And, again - these are all very nice stories, which should help to inspire you in your daily living, without demonstrating how to.",1176681600,10,714,4.75
7924634,5,B00004W45A,I found this collection as expected. Deepak Chopra as always is very deep in thoughts and therefore very inspirational. I cannot wait for his next release.,1169164800,4,155,5.0
7924635,3,B00004W45A,Deepak has a world wide reputation which is more than justified. That said this current offering is high on promise and unfortunately low on the delivery of value in the form of 'how to' information and spiritual development techniques. As with so much of contemporary quantum theory literature today this collection weaves an interesting story but that is all. Of course we can all robustly influence or own futures through our intentions... but Deepak come on... how about a few techniques. The Essential DVD Collection?... perhaps not.,1162857600,22,538,5.195402298850575
