3755276,5,B001PPGAJ4,Angel wars is a great show for kids. I have used these as a curriculum in my children's church for years.,1398729600,,105,4.0476190476190474
3755277,5,B001PPGAJ4,"Action packed!!! Great, believable graphics!!!  The message and visualization of ""spiritual warfare""...AWESOME!!!!  My kid's love the whole series and want more. :)",1397779200,,164,6.409090909090909
3755278,5,B001PPGAJ4,"My son got this for Christmas and he has watched it non stop.  He already knows every word and begs to watch again.  We have already ordered all the other Angel War videos.  It is sad to say that they haven't made any new ones in years.  True that they are not truly biblical, but from what I can see it is nothing that actually changes to word.  That being said, the lessons are biblical and are good for kids.",1388361600,,411,4.0875
3755279,5,B001PPGAJ4,"My family and I love this series! Wish more would be made.
We need more animation with an uplifting message.",1387324800,,108,4.45
3755280,1,B001PPGAJ4,"I bought this DVD for my grandsons for Christmas. When they opened it to play it there was no DVD in it. It was sealed and never been opened so we couldn't figure out what had happened. Sorry it has taken me so long, they are in Colorado and we just remembered that I needed to writ to this seller.",1359590400,,298,3.9833333333333334
3755281,5,B001PPGAJ4,"My own sons, nephews and just about every boy we show this to LOVE it.  There is so little action adventure with a godly worldview available and this fits the bill.  Some Christians might be uncomfortable with its depiction of angels as it depicts things which we don't know and can only speculate about.  But we found it a great reinforcer of good values, depicting the spiritual battle between good and evil.",1357948800,,410,4.666666666666667
3755282,5,B001PPGAJ4,Angel Wars is a great alternative to modern day destructive cartoons for your children. With a biblical base and useful life lessons.,1345420800,,133,5.090909090909091
3755283,4,B001PPGAJ4,"This is the fourth installment in the series,and this is one of those items that will be either loved or hated. The basis of course is that there are angelic beings and demonic ones that are are constantly at war with each other...""one side bent on destruction,the other on redemption"".This premise of course is quite biblical. Where it is likely to become controversial however is the way the characters are depicted in a ""futuristic"",or almost superhero type way. Those with a legalistic approach will probably be quick to trash the series. I have a different feeling,as the father of a 21,22,3 and 5 year old,and having grown up with star wars,the transformers,G I Joe,etc. I know how the attraction that action movies (cartoons)have for kids young and old. In keeping with this there are liberties taken like the types of weapons used by these angelic beings,yet the series has merit in the values it communicates such as hope when it seems hopeless,obedience,trust,loyalty,kindness,etc and if in the process of entertaining it instills these values than it would appear that this series is a good investment.",1334188800,7,1113,5.054347826086956
3755314,5,B001PPGAJ4,"I have all of the angel wars dvd's and I absolutely love them. At first I thought I had purchased episode 1 for a second time but when I watched it I was like wow! This should have been episode 1. This dvd starts at the beginning and explains how (what you see in episode 1 & 2) came to be. I took this dvd to church for our youth movie night and the adults were prob more jazzed than the kids. This is a really great series & the youth of today need more spiritual cartoons that are of this quality (graphics, sound, storyline, objective & biblical truth). It's been a few years since the last episode was released. I hope the creators continue the series.",1309737600,,657,4.181102362204724
3755315,5,B001PPGAJ4,My son (he is 7 years old) loves the movie. He wants to see it all the time. My only regret is that are not too many episodes & DVD's and I hope that they will come up with more. I like to watch them too. Very good and instructional.,1305417600,,233,3.68
3755316,4,B001PPGAJ4,"This is a great DVD to put into your collection, especially if you have children. It is themed like Star Wars, where, in this case Michael is in charge of an Angel Cruiser called the ""Seven"". I don't fully agree with the theology at the beginning of the DVD, that's why I took off a star. The graphics are clean and well done. It provides nice wholesome entertainment for the whole family.

The DVD is broken down into 5 episodes of the adventures of Kira and Eli, two young angel warriors that are trying to earn their wings. The episodes and the moral behind each one is listed below:

[1] Some Sound Advise - this episode teaches the value of praise and worship, when all seems to be lost, a way out can be created by singing praises unto the Lord and making a merry melody unto Him.

[2] A Bone to Pick - this section of the DVD teaches you not to lean unto your own understanding. When faced by a formidable foe; lean not to unto your own understanding, but acknowledge the Lord and he will direct your path.

[3] Be Careful What You Wish For - This teaching deals with cheating and deception, and how short cuts have a way of back firing. This is taught by the way Eli seems to be doing very well all of a sudden, but this is really due the fake wings that he is using.

[4] Sticking Together - this episode teaches about team work - Eli being over confident runs off by himself to chase a small demonic bug. But the problem is really a lot larger than he has catered for.

[5] Return to Sender - In this last section, messenger angels, as opposed to warring angels are introduced. The idea of team work and co-operation is deepened, angels of differing skill sets must work together in order for a message to be safely delivered.

The DVD is therefore not only entertaining, but it also teaches wholesome values. I recommend it.",1287446400,2,1835,4.332361516034985
3755317,5,B001PPGAJ4,"This product provides a glypmse into the unseen battle that goes on around us and impacts our lives.  The 3-D animation and the stories are really fun, but there is a deeper reality that is being illustrated in these DVDs and that is there is an Angel War that is taking place all around us.  We see it in scripture, but this animated series helps to bring that spiritual battle into the lives we are living today.  I really enjoyed this series watching them with my grandkids and highly recommend it to those who want to be entertained with a product story line that goes deeper than just action heros.

3755318,5,B001PPGAJ4,"This DVD was extremely entertaining. I got it for the kids in my church's Vacation Bible School and found that the adults loved it just as much as the children did. There are some comedic points that help you learn about Angels and the Bible, but it will keep you enthralled until the very end of the movie. One point I teach to this day that I got from this movie is learning to lean on someone until they get some understanding. You, your children, your church and whomever you want to share this with will enjoy this very much.",1276300800,,530,4.31
3755319,5,B001PPGAJ4,"I have a 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son.  They started with the first movie about six months ago and loved it.  It's somewhat rare to find a movie that they both want to watch, but no problems for them to agree on any of the Angel Wars movies.  They like all of them, and don't seem to grow tired of watching them.  I highly recommend this series.",1262649600,,355,3.9577464788732395
3755320,5,B001PPGAJ4,"the dvd is very good but the only thing i didn't like is that i wish it was a movie becuz it is so good.it is a bunch of episodes put into one dvd.but i HIGHLY recommend it becuz its funny,fun,etc. BUY IT cuz its great for kids and adults",1255651200,,238,3.78
3755321,4,B001PPGAJ4,It stuck in the middle of the movie thus cannot watch some part of it. But the vendor returned the purchase price and shipping costs.,1246147200,,133,4.36
3755322,5,B001PPGAJ4,"I just got this vie UPS [Today,May 4th 2009] and Now I am writung this review. I love this movie and its unique spin on heaven, angels, demons and the war that is happening right now.  Get this movie because it has positive clean messages not seen in the empty violent sex filled meaningless action sequence laden blockbusters of Hollywood. A true feel good inspirational movie without being corny. The animation is great and I have almost 1000 movies to compare.  I will support this if more come out and I will keep hope [See thhis film!] alive. Get the boxset offered from a seller here on Amazon. Pun intended. :)",1241395200,3,617,4.54954954954955
3755323,5,B001PPGAJ4,This is the fourth installment of the Angel Wars Series  and an excellent example of how good clean Christian films can be fun and entertaining for all ages . My Teen son 15 loves to watch it . The film is done in the Japanese Anime style so for the video game/ Anime  junkie it has lots of well done  eye candy and the short story line behind each segment keeps even the wigglest of viewers involved . A good investment for any household  with kids . These are not all boy there are strong females aswell.,1240358400,,506,4.185567010309279
