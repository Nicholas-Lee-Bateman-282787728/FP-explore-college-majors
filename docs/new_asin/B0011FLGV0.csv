3064979,5,B0011FLGV0,Seriously.  It's a very funny show.  All this man can think about is the burning in his loins which makes for great comedy.  The kids are funny too.  I'd recommend this one for purchase.,1208476800,7,186,4.382352941176471
3064980,5,B0011FLGV0,"If you love Hugh Laurie in ""House"" then check him out in this British series he did right before becoming the grumpy old doctor we adore. In ""Fortysomething,"" he plays another grumpy, but a little less old, doctor and a family man facing a midlife crisis. It's hysterical and real and Hugh Laurie doing what he does best.",1208304000,30,321,4.551724137931035
3064991,5,B0011FLGV0,everything as expected.,1468886400,,23,7.0
3064992,4,B0011FLGV0,Offbeat and very funny. Too bad there aren't more seasons.,1454889600,,58,4.9
3064993,5,B0011FLGV0,"I love this series and wish there were more.  Hugh Laurie is his usual brilliant self and there is a cameo by his m'colleague Stephen Fry in one episode.  Anna Chancellor was the big surprise, only seeing her in Pride & Prejudice and What a Girl Wants, this showed her to be an amazing actress with a warmth and charm that the other roles never allowed her to express and it only enhanced her physical beauty.  Benedict Cumberbatch as their oldest son was wonderful and sometimes I think he bears a resemblance to Hugh Laurie, I know he doesn't but still.  Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who) as Laurie's nemesis will have you laughing out loud at his insane antics.  Slices of life that are over the top but not completely unrealistic.",1453939200,,727,4.561538461538461
3064994,5,B0011FLGV0,Loved this--especially the last episode with the chicken,1442188800,,56,6.125
3064995,5,B0011FLGV0,Definitely entertaining. Watched the whole season at one outing. Was worth it.,1435622400,,78,5.583333333333333
3064996,5,B0011FLGV0,The funniest mini-series ever.............Peter Capaldi was hilarious!!,1435190400,,71,9.285714285714286
3064997,5,B0011FLGV0,Hugh Laurie at his best with the added treat of a young Benedict Cumberbatch showing an early sensitive but witty performance of the kind for which he has now become well-known.,1435104000,2,177,4.741935483870968
3064998,5,B0011FLGV0,"I loved this DVD set.  I laughed through the whole thing.  If you are a Hugh Laurie fan I would recommend seeing it.  If you are a Benedict Cumberbatch fan I recommend it also, he does a great job.",1434585600,,197,4.0
3064999,5,B0011FLGV0,Great! Many talented actors here before we got to know them in the States. Any one who has ever had or been part of a family will enjoy and relate to this serio-comedy,1432339200,,167,4.090909090909091

3065011,5,B0011FLGV0,"Forty-something is hilarious.  Benedict Cumberbatch is in nearly every episode as the couple's young son, Rory.  There's even an added extra for fans of Peter Capaldi, since he co-stars as the main characters' business associate.",1424390400,,229,5.514285714285714
3065012,5,B0011FLGV0,Watched it for early Cumberbatch but ended up enjoying the whole cast.  Very funny.,1422403200,,83,4.928571428571429

3065015,5,B0011FLGV0,Hugely enjoyable! Wish there had been MANY more episodes. Cast is terrific!,1412899200,,75,5.333333333333333

3065017,5,B0011FLGV0,"I could go into a long-winded review of Fortysomething, but, to keep it short and to the point:

It's brilliant.

Hilariously funny with actors that people know and love, and some that we might not recognize the names of but learn to love from their performance in this TV miniseries. Humour galore, a great deal of it what would be dubbed ""inappropriate"", but that's what gives it the comedy effect. I don't like comedies, even, and this one made me laugh out loud countless times during each episode.

I wish there would have been more episodes, but if it hadn't ended where this did, we probably wouldn't have ever had shows like ""House"" or even ""Sherlock"". Overall, a good comedy instilling the values of family (and sometimes, the lack thereof) and love, with all the snarky attitude of British humour, it's a good investment for the Hugh Laurie, comedy, or British fan.",1400889600,3,875,4.743421052631579
3065018,5,B0011FLGV0,"Hugh Laurie is one of my favorite actors and he plays a comedic role in this short-lived British comedy.  It is definitely adult entertainment with the topics present but full of irony and laughable situations.  I originally watched the series, only 6 episodes, on our local PBS channel and knew that I would like to watch it again and again so I purchased the series.  If you like British-style comedy with slightly adult topics, you will enjoy this series.",1394841600,,458,4.772151898734177
3065019,4,B0011FLGV0,"I'm sure that Fortysomething would have had a longer run, if Hugh Laurie hadn't gotten his role in 'House.'  But these are six of the most entertaining episodes of sophisticated British comedy that I've seen. I bought it on DVD when it became unavailable for streaming on Netflix. Great writing, great cast. Loads of fun!  Hugh Laurie, Anna Chancellor, Sheila Hancock, Peter Capaldi in a particularly hilarious turn, and a young Benedict Cumberbatch.",1394668800,3,450,5.1506849315068495
3065020,1,B0011FLGV0,"Ok, I really wanted to like this because it features some of my favorite actors early in their careers, but it is simply bizarre and totally random. It begins with Laurie's Dr. Slippery (?) living in a house with one grown son (Cumberbatch), one worthless, jobless sponge that is very nearly so and one high school delinquent. The sons walk all over Slippery, showing him and their mother zero respect (and not in an amusing way, just rude and tasteless), and its not hard to see why as he exerts zero authority. The good doctor also has sudden bouts of telepathy where he can sometimes (but not always!) hear the thoughts of others (again, zero explanation or real tie-in with the overall plot). The mother goes to a new job to ""live up to her potential"" (I suppose after raising three sons like hers I would be in doubt as to my personal worth as well) only to find it has disappeared, then runs into an old woman (lesbian??) while walking at the park, where she accidentally leaves her phone. 32 unexplained refrigerators (random!) several very loud bouts of intercourse (during a visit from the girl's parents, mind you) and a string of tired old-man+young woman+viagra jokes later, and NOTHING has come together, but moreover for a comedy, NONE of it was funny. Rude, embarrassing, offensive, yes. Humorous? Not so much.",1394064000,3,1325,4.740259740259741
3065021,5,B0011FLGV0,"Hugh Laurie, Peter Capaldi , and a VERY young Ben Cumberbatch.  Is there anything else needed? But more it has! A great plot, and funny!  Hugh Laurie plays a NHS doctor who is in the midst of a mid life crisis.  His three rambunctious almost grown boys, and a wife heading back to the work force doesn't help matters.  I could almost wish that this had lasted longer.  But if it had, we wouldn't have had House, Sherlock and soon the 13th Doctor.  So Kudos for what it is and if wishes were horses beggars would ride. If you like Brits, House, Sherlock, or comedy in general BUY IT!!!!!",1393632000,3,586,4.330275229357798
3065022,1,B0011FLGV0,"I realize it is supposed to be satire but it is was so cliched to the point of absurdity.  Thankfully it received poor ratings in England (helps restore my faith in the British). The writing is weak, forced and just plain bad.

Admire Laurie as a musician, (never watched ""House"")  and after watching this I think he is better  off sticking too his music.",1389225600,,355,4.5
3065023,5,B0011FLGV0,Even better than I had hoped. So many favorites crammed into one show with lots of comedy stuffed in between,1378166400,,108,4.45
3065024,5,B0011FLGV0,"Hugh Laurie at his best.  And a young Benedict Cumberbatch!  And Anna Chancellor!  And that new Dr. Who guy.  And a guest shot of Stephen Fry, where they have a Jeeves & Bertie Wooster conversation.  Could not be more awesome!",1377561600,,226,4.55
3065025,5,B0011FLGV0,"This family is opposite of the family I grew up in - and I loved it!! Thought I wouldn't, but it was great.  Laurie is a great actor and so were the rest of the cast.  As a huge BBC fan, you can imagine my joy at finding Laurie, Cumberbatch, and Capaldi all in the same show!!",1377388800,,276,3.824561403508772
3065026,1,B0011FLGV0,"Outdated rubbish, frankly it is a miracle that Hugh Laurie got House. Maybe in spite of not because of eh?",1377216000,,106,4.35
3065027,3,B0011FLGV0,The cast is pretty amazing - lots of folks have hit it big since this show was produced. But other than that just an adequate example of a Britcom.,1377129600,,147,4.103448275862069
3065028,5,B0011FLGV0,"If you enjoy Hugh Laurie's acting, this show is fun. It's also much lighter than his later work in House.
I liked it very well.",1377129600,,127,4.12
3065029,2,B0011FLGV0,"The only thing this show is missing is a laugh over to try to make the supposed humor funny. As a fan of Hugh Laurie in House, this left me very disappointed.",1376956800,3,158,3.96875
3065030,5,B0011FLGV0,"Excellent show, sadly only one six episode season. Hugh Laurie at his best as always - and an excellent cast. Well worth watching even though quirky at times!",1376956800,,158,4.678571428571429
3065041,5,B0011FLGV0,I stumbled upon this show....and after watching the UK seasons of Mistresses....I was craving more UK tele.  I loved this show...it's funny and refreshing,1376784000,,154,5.416666666666667
3065042,5,B0011FLGV0,Ran across this show over a year ago while looking for British TV.  Laughed constantly throughout the show.  I come back to it whenever I need a good laugh.,1376352000,2,156,4.344827586206897
3065043,4,B0011FLGV0,"The guy has an accent... unbelievable!

 You know you should allow us, we folks, to just click how many stars we think something deserves, rather than forcing these public school book reports upon all of us.

 Why can't a guy just say, ""It was bloody well good"".",1373241600,2,262,4.51063829787234
3065044,5,B0011FLGV0,"This show is very good. The characters are delightful. The stories are well written. The photography is perfect. Watch it, you'll enjoy the show.",1373155200,,145,5.083333333333333
3065045,5,B0011FLGV0,I found the story lines quite enjoyable. I wish they had made more than six episodes though! I would have loved to see what happens now that the story ended the way it did.,1372982400,,172,4.088235294117647
3065046,4,B0011FLGV0,"Hugh Laurie was fantastic in this, and, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as always. I thoroughly enjoyed this show.",1372204800,,128,5.45
3065047,5,B0011FLGV0,Another british comedy that is well made. Very good story line and every episode is very well directed. Good watch,1372204800,,114,4.75
3065048,4,B0011FLGV0,"I would expect that anyone checking out this show is a fan of Britcoms or Hugh Laurie.  If not, I would have to say move along.  Hugh is brilliant as always playing a delusional Dr. with marital problems.  His three sons are of no help as they have issues of their own.  His wife is starting a new job and that just makes things worse.  One more thing, if you're looking for House or a British equivalent you won't find it here.  This is purely a comedy.  If you like the crazier type of comedy like Faulty Towers, My Hero, or Black Adder (especially the series featuring Hugh Laurie) I would recommend you pick this up.  You won't be disappointed.",1371427200,,648,4.341666666666667
3065049,1,B0011FLGV0,"I couldn't get through the first episode.  Maybe just not a good fit for me, but others might like.  Nothing to draw me in enough to even give it a bit of time.",1371081600,3,160,3.8181818181818183
3065050,4,B0011FLGV0,"This show is funny, and even somewhat touching.  Wish there were more episodes! It was a lot of fun seeing Benedict Cumberbatch pre-Sherlock, too.",1370390400,,146,5.083333333333333
3065051,5,B0011FLGV0,In all the right ways. Funny. heartwarming. Each character was well balanced in adding to the story line. Want more.,1369440000,,116,4.85
3065052,5,B0011FLGV0,"I'm a fan of both Hugh Laurie (House) and Anna Chancellor (Grace of 'Will and Grace') and thought it might be fun to see them in something together.  This BBC TV series was filmed before 'House', and I really enjoyed Season 1.",1368921600,,226,4.380952380952381
3065053,2,B0011FLGV0,I was expecting more from this show given the great acting Hugh Laurie shows on House.  I found the first episode to be boring and laughed rarely.  The other episodes might be better.,1368921600,,183,4.515151515151516
3065054,5,B0011FLGV0,"Nothing is more important than communication in any relationship. However if the Slippery family knew this they would be quite dull.
Some slapstick, lots of innuendo and plenty of sexy time lol",1368403200,,193,5.0625
3065055,4,B0011FLGV0,"This series features not only Hugh Laurie but also Stephen Fry and Benedict Cumberbatch. While the first two are greatly known for their comedy (A Bit of Fry & Laurie, & Jeeves and Wooster to name two), I was pleasantly surprised to see Benedict Cumberbatch in a humorous role. Well done & greatly enjoyed poking of becoming middle-aged. Getting older has never been this funny!",1368403200,,378,4.8307692307692305
3065056,4,B0011FLGV0,"I wouldn't call it must-see, but entertaining British comedy. Fun characters and story lines. This show is enjoyable to watch.",1368144000,2,126,5.35
3065057,5,B0011FLGV0,"great show with hilarious story line. great watch. be careful though, has a tendency to prompt marathon watching. spacing each episode might help make this last longer",1367452800,,167,5.222222222222222
3065058,4,B0011FLGV0,"The acting is great.  The story broken down into skits, are very amusing, but the story line gets stalled with a rehashing of character Paul Slippery's curious inability to initiate sex with his wife.  How many times can you laugh at that, without then, losing sympathy for him?",1366588800,,278,4.770833333333333

3065061,1,B0011FLGV0,"This is a slow moving show that is just plain dull.  I have trouble watching Hugh Laurie play an inept husband and dad after watching him in ""House"" where his character is the complete opposite.  However, I did not give the show a fair chance because I shut it off half way through.  I couldn't bear it any longer.  May be it improved during the second half.",1365465600,,358,4.298507462686567
3065062,5,B0011FLGV0,"Hilarious, with top notch acting by Hugh Laurie and a lot of British activity.  Many lols were had, by me.",1363824000,,106,4.3
3065063,5,B0011FLGV0,"This is another great British show! Too bad there's only a couple episodes! Nonetheless, it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of British comedy!",1362614400,,154,5.2

3065065,4,B0011FLGV0,"Being a house fan for many years, interesting to see Hugh Laurie in an opposite personality role. He is a doctor in this role as well. Funny.",1361664000,,141,4.2592592592592595

3065068,3,B0011FLGV0,"I found it hard to like Paul Slippery (played by Hugh Laurie). He's a neurotic man going through a mid-life crisis with all the frantic jabbering and funny voices he developed in the Jeeves and Wooster series. It's hard to generate any sympathy or even interest in the travails of his character let alone those of his three randy sons. Anna Chancellor, on the other hand, is appealing and sympathetic as his wife. Hugh Laurie is the director and lead actor so he deserves much of the blame for this show's failings. Granted, the writers gave him very little to work with other than overworked sight gags, stale clichs, and highly predictable comic set pieces. The good news is that the second episode is nowhere near as bad as the first episode.",1356220800,,745,4.651515151515151
3065069,5,B0011FLGV0,"I discovered this little gem purely because I was looking for MORE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH. He once again displays, at the tender age of twenty-six or so, that he's as good at comedy as at drama, but the star of the show is the inestimable Hugh Laurie, just before the start of his American series House. Laurie plays Paul Slippery, a middle-aged doctor who has three sons, one friend and one enemy amongst his co-workers, and a gorgeous wife (Anna Chancellor) who's about to start her first job outside the home in over two decades. Paul can't remember the last time they had sex; meanwhile, his two older sons are having rather a lot of sex, his wife may be working for a lesbian, his youngest son is making dodgy online purchases, and the fishmonger (Stephen Fry) doesn't like him.

The series has only six episodes. I have watched the whole thing perhaps three or four times now, and laughed every single time. I highly recommend it, especially if you're fortysomething and your kids are having way more sex than you are.",1354665600,10,1022,4.6464088397790055
3065070,2,B0011FLGV0,"I have always loved the comedic abilities of both Hugh Laurie & Anna Chancelor.  However, as much as I looked forward to this series, I was very disappointed.  Both these actors were wasted on a totally. trite and NOT funny series of almost fiasco proportions. By the time I got to the third episode, not only did I not think they were funny, I definitely got the impression they too, knew it!. I would not recommend this to anyone! So Sad! The writers should be ashamed of themselves and have hopefully moved on to more suitable profesions.",1350691200,3,541,4.56701030927835

3065075,5,B0011FLGV0,"In a world of crass comedy-by-numbers in which insensitivity masquerades as ""edgy"" this series is something quite different. The comedy is low-key and never cruel, and even the minor characters get developed enough along the way to be interesting. While the first episode initially seems as if it's going to be too mechanical, Laurie's character Paul develops quickly enough for us to be touched by the humanity of the guy. And that's what is central to this series: in the middle of all the quotidian upsets and misunderstandings, in a world in which everyone is too busy to connect, Paul struggles always to do the right thing in a confusing world even though he is never encouraged or acknowledged. It would have been very easy to write a series in which the middle-aged man is an object of ridicule; instead, this series cleverly sets up all the standard tropes but turns it around by enabling us to empathize and sympathize with Paul.

One of the core themes is the fact that Paul and his wife Estelle have't had sex for so long that he can no longer remember the last time they did it. On the surface this could be an indictment of Paul - classic old guy, losing his ability and his memory, isn't it funny, etc. But instead of this obvious stock approach we see Paul struggling to find ways to reconnect to his wife, whom he adores, even though she's now moving out of the family orbit and back into the world of work. He tries to support her even though she gives him a hard time. Laurie is excellent at conveying Paul's sense of being adrift in the world, of conveying his humanity as he struggles always to do the right thing.

Not since the old BBC 2 TV series Butterflies with Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer has there been such a delicate blend of pathos and humor, of vulnerability, confusion and old-fashioned family values. It's charming and heart-warming. And there are some great cameos from the supporting cast.",1332892800,15,1929,4.6209912536443145

The supporting cast is excellent. I am a huge Hugh Laurie and House fan, but he is incredibly engaging in this. Also becoming a big Benedict Cumberbatch fan. I felt smitten with him in this as the oldest son. Just in scenes where he is smiling at his family, he is marvelous. (Recently enjoyed his starmarking turn in Sherlock from the BBC.) This comedy is very modern and could have had a long run, I think. But then we never would have had House.",1291248000,9,620,4.4
3065079,2,B0011FLGV0,"I'm a fan of Hugh Laurie and have enjoyed every season of House, MD.  I'm also a 45 year old male and after learning about what's in store for the economy, thanks to Gerald Celente, I'm having a mid life crisis of my own.  So after reading the description on the back of the box, I was pretty sure this was going to be the best that entertainment has to offer and the funniest of comedies.

Turns out I am very disappointed.  I know what Hugh Laurie is capable of!  And this doesn't begin to tap into his acting talent.

The acting in general is forced, stiff and unbelievable.  Consequently, the characters come across as flat.

Ever watch a show where you want to know the characters names, and end up knowing them early on?  Not the case here.  I can barely remember the last name of the guy Hugh Laurie plays, Mr. Slippery or some such.

I realize British comedy IS generally stiff, slow and painfully boring at times and often hard to understand or relate to.  Ab Fab comes to mind, however it was rather funny, despite the culture difference.  Mr. Bean was even better, perhaps in part because he is a man of so few words.

I will admit that despite its rave reviews, 'The Office' also did nothing for me.  Same goes for 'Weeds'.

However nearly all the other shows I've watched have been amazingly entertaining.  The list includes shows like 'The Wire', 'Dexter', 'Desperate Housewives', 'United States of Tara', 'Criminal Minds', 'Numb3rs', 'Glee' and so many more!  I'm able to find something rather worthwhile about nearly every show I watch, with the exception of 'Forty Something', 'Weeds', and 'The Office'.

So I suppose if you liked 'Weeds' or 'The office' (and I know many, Many of you do), it is possible you may like this show as well.  But if you, too, found the characters on either of these shows to be Flat, you might be well advised to skip this one also!",1287273600,3,1878,4.5
3065080,3,B0011FLGV0,"I had seen some episodes of this British sitcom on a local PBS station and found them funny enough to want to see more, hence my purchase of the DVDs. (At the time I didn't know that the series was short-lived.)

The gifted actor, Hugh Laurie, has proven his skill at playing diverse roles over the years, whether in comedy or drama - (Blackadder; Wooster & Jeeves; Sense and Sensibility; Cousin Bette - to name just a few titles you can research) but his portrayal of the insecure, offspring-overwhelmed English GP,Dr. Slippery, might surprise American devotees of the taciturn, sarcastic but brilliant Dr. House.  However, take a look if you enjoy British humor (some of which made me laugh out loud) and if you'd welcome the opportunity of seeing just how talented Laurie is in playing vastly different characters.

Personally, I could have done without the sexual exploits of Slippery's sons and had the focus remain on his relationship with his wife, played by the fascinating Anna Chancellor (look her up: Duckface in Four Weddings and a Funeral), who makes an excellent foil to the anxiety-plagued doctor.

Laurie, who directed the series, is comfortable enough in his own skin to put himself 'out there,' - literally, in one hilarious scene, where he stands naked on the street.

If you're a Hugh Laurie devotee, this six-DVD set is good value for money.  If not, give it a pass.",1274659200,5,1387,4.831223628691983

I never understood why people want to discuss their sex life with their kids and vice versa.  Hugh Laurie wasn't funny in this one and I could not identify with any of the characters, just reminded me of several of my Euro friends who are caught up with talking a lot about themselves and their sex life; in my opinion a sign of low self-esteem...and you know what they say about dogs that bark.
If you want to watch a great movie with Hugh Laurie, check out ""Peter's friends"", which I discovered way before House M.D. existed.

I've read reviews complaining about the behavior of some of the people in the family, but what you have to remember is that this was intended to be a series. Character development takes time, and not everything needs to be revealed all at once. It's a shame that it was canceled before there was time to give more insight about the family.

I knew going in that this was a canceled series and was worried that it would end on a cliffhanger with no good resolution. It doesn't. Everything wraps up nicely in the sixth (and last) episode, in a way that almost makes this more like a miniseries.",1257033600,13,826,4.357142857142857

I am so happy I bought it! It is absolutely brilliant; Hugh's character, Paul, is somewhat of a cross between House and Wooster. I simply adore this show; the first episode in particular is truly hilarious: one of the many high points is when two of Paul's adult sons are fighting over a girl and Paul orders them to go to their rooms. Sex is a major theme throughout the series; one of the running jokes is that Paul can't remember the last time he and his wife have made love while his sons spend most of their time fighting over a pair of sisters. In spite of the sexual elements, I found the show to be refreshingly tasteful, especially compared to the majority of American shows. Further more, its obvious, at least in my opinion,  that in spite of their problems, Paul and his wife were still quite devoted to one another. I'm sorry to say that I'm probably not explaining this show very well, but I can assure you that this is one of the best dvd purchases I've made in a very long time. If you like Hugh Laurie even a little, this is a must own.",1213747200,56,1213,4.206008583690987

Benedict Cumberbatch as their oldest son was wonderful and sometimes I think he bears a resemblance to Hugh Laurie, I know he doesn't but still.

It's brilliant.

Hilariously funny with actors that people know and love, and some that we might not recognize the names of but learn to love from their performance in this TV miniseries. Humour galore, a great deal of it what would be dubbed ""inappropriate"", but that's what gives it the comedy effect. I don't like comedies, even, and this one made me laugh out loud countless times during each episode.

I wish there would have been more episodes, but if it hadn't ended where this did, we probably wouldn't have ever had shows like ""House"" or even ""Sherlock"". Overall, a good comedy instilling the values of family (and sometimes, the lack thereof) and love, with all the snarky attitude of British humour, it's a good investment for the Hugh Laurie, comedy, or British fan.",1400889600,3,875,4.743421052631579

It begins with Laurie's Dr. Slippery (?) living in a house with one grown son (Cumberbatch), one worthless, jobless sponge that is very nearly so and one high school delinquent. The sons walk all over Slippery, showing him and their mother zero respect (and not in an amusing way, just rude and tasteless), and its not hard to see why as he exerts zero authority. The good doctor also has sudden bouts of telepathy where he can sometimes (but not always!) hear the thoughts of others (again, zero explanation or real tie-in with the overall plot). The mother goes to a new job to ""live up to her potential"" (I suppose after raising three sons like hers I would be in doubt as to my personal worth as well) only to find it has disappeared, then runs into an old woman (lesbian??) while walking at the park, where she accidentally leaves her phone. 32 unexplained refrigerators (random!) several very loud bouts of intercourse (during a visit from the girl's parents, mind you) and a string of tired old-man+young woman+viagra jokes later, and NOTHING has come together, but moreover for a comedy, NONE of it was funny.

He's a neurotic man going through a mid-life crisis with all the frantic jabbering and funny voices he developed in the Jeeves and Wooster series. It's hard to generate any sympathy or even interest in the travails of his character let alone those of his three randy sons. Anna Chancellor, on the other hand, is appealing and sympathetic as his wife. Hugh Laurie is the director and lead actor so he deserves much of the blame for this show's failings. Granted, the writers gave him very little to work with other than overworked sight gags, stale clichs, and highly predictable comic set pieces. The good news is that the second episode is nowhere near as bad as the first episode.",1356220800,,745,4.651515151515151
3299566,5,B0011FLGV0,"I discovered this little gem purely because I was looking for MORE BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH. He once again displays, at the tender age of twenty-six or so, that he's as good at comedy as at drama, but the star of the show is the inestimable Hugh Laurie, just before the start of his American series House. Laurie plays Paul Slippery, a middle-aged doctor who has three sons, one friend and one enemy amongst his co-workers, and a gorgeous wife (Anna Chancellor) who's about to start her first job outside the home in over two decades. Paul can't remember the last time they had sex; meanwhile, his two older sons are having rather a lot of sex, his wife may be working for a lesbian, his youngest son is making dodgy online purchases, and the fishmonger (Stephen Fry) doesn't like him.

The series has only six episodes. I have watched the whole thing perhaps three or four times now, and laughed every single time. I highly recommend it, especially if you're fortysomething and your kids are having way more sex than you are.",1354665600,10,1022,4.6464088397790055

3299572,5,B0011FLGV0,"In a world of crass comedy-by-numbers in which insensitivity masquerades as ""edgy"" this series is something quite different. The comedy is low-key and never cruel, and even the minor characters get developed enough along the way to be interesting. While the first episode initially seems as if it's going to be too mechanical, Laurie's character Paul develops quickly enough for us to be touched by the humanity of the guy. And that's what is central to this series: in the middle of all the quotidian upsets and misunderstandings, in a world in which everyone is too busy to connect, Paul struggles always to do the right thing in a confusing world even though he is never encouraged or acknowledged. It would have been very easy to write a series in which the middle-aged man is an object of ridicule; instead, this series cleverly sets up all the standard tropes but turns it around by enabling us to empathize and sympathize with Paul.

One of the core themes is the fact that Paul and his wife Estelle have't had sex for so long that he can no longer remember the last time they did it. On the surface this could be an indictment of Paul - classic old guy, losing his ability and his memory, isn't it funny, etc. But instead of this obvious stock approach we see Paul struggling to find ways to reconnect to his wife, whom he adores, even though she's now moving out of the family orbit and back into the world of work. He tries to support her even though she gives him a hard time. Laurie is excellent at conveying Paul's sense of being adrift in the world, of conveying his humanity as he struggles always to do the right thing.

Not since the old BBC 2 TV series Butterflies with Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Palmer has there been such a delicate blend of pathos and humor, of vulnerability, confusion and old-fashioned family values. It's charming and heart-warming. And there are some great cameos from the supporting cast.",1332892800,15,1929,4.6209912536443145

The supporting cast is excellent. I am a huge Hugh Laurie and House fan, but he is incredibly engaging in this. Also becoming a big Benedict Cumberbatch fan. I felt smitten with him in this as the oldest son. Just in scenes where he is smiling at his family, he is marvelous. (Recently enjoyed his starmarking turn in Sherlock from the BBC.) This comedy is very modern and could have had a long run, I think. But then we never would have had House.",1291248000,9,620,4.4
3299576,2,B0011FLGV0,"I'm a fan of Hugh Laurie and have enjoyed every season of House, MD.  I'm also a 45 year old male and after learning about what's in store for the economy, thanks to Gerald Celente, I'm having a mid life crisis of my own.  So after reading the description on the back of the box, I was pretty sure this was going to be the best that entertainment has to offer and the funniest of comedies.

Turns out I am very disappointed.  I know what Hugh Laurie is capable of!  And this doesn't begin to tap into his acting talent.

The acting in general is forced, stiff and unbelievable.  Consequently, the characters come across as flat.

Ever watch a show where you want to know the characters names, and end up knowing them early on?  Not the case here.  I can barely remember the last name of the guy Hugh Laurie plays, Mr. Slippery or some such.

I realize British comedy IS generally stiff, slow and painfully boring at times and often hard to understand or relate to.  Ab Fab comes to mind, however it was rather funny, despite the culture difference.  Mr. Bean was even better, perhaps in part because he is a man of so few words.

I will admit that despite its rave reviews, 'The Office' also did nothing for me.  Same goes for 'Weeds'.

However nearly all the other shows I've watched have been amazingly entertaining.  The list includes shows like 'The Wire', 'Dexter', 'Desperate Housewives', 'United States of Tara', 'Criminal Minds', 'Numb3rs', 'Glee' and so many more!  I'm able to find something rather worthwhile about nearly every show I watch, with the exception of 'Forty Something', 'Weeds', and 'The Office'.

So I suppose if you liked 'Weeds' or 'The office' (and I know many, Many of you do), it is possible you may like this show as well.  But if you, too, found the characters on either of these shows to be Flat, you might be well advised to skip this one also!",1287273600,3,1878,4.5
3299577,3,B0011FLGV0,"I had seen some episodes of this British sitcom on a local PBS station and found them funny enough to want to see more, hence my purchase of the DVDs. (At the time I didn't know that the series was short-lived.)

The gifted actor, Hugh Laurie, has proven his skill at playing diverse roles over the years, whether in comedy or drama - (Blackadder; Wooster & Jeeves; Sense and Sensibility; Cousin Bette - to name just a few titles you can research) but his portrayal of the insecure, offspring-overwhelmed English GP,Dr. Slippery, might surprise American devotees of the taciturn, sarcastic but brilliant Dr. House.  However, take a look if you enjoy British humor (some of which made me laugh out loud) and if you'd welcome the opportunity of seeing just how talented Laurie is in playing vastly different characters.

Personally, I could have done without the sexual exploits of Slippery's sons and had the focus remain on his relationship with his wife, played by the fascinating Anna Chancellor (look her up: Duckface in Four Weddings and a Funeral), who makes an excellent foil to the anxiety-plagued doctor.

Laurie, who directed the series, is comfortable enough in his own skin to put himself 'out there,' - literally, in one hilarious scene, where he stands naked on the street.

If you're a Hugh Laurie devotee, this six-DVD set is good value for money.  If not, give it a pass.",1274659200,5,1387,4.831223628691983

I never understood why people want to discuss their sex life with their kids and vice versa.  Hugh Laurie wasn't funny in this one and I could not identify with any of the characters, just reminded me of several of my Euro friends who are caught up with talking a lot about themselves and their sex life; in my opinion a sign of low self-esteem...and you know what they say about dogs that bark.
If you want to watch a great movie with Hugh Laurie, check out ""Peter's friends"", which I discovered way before House M.D. existed.

I've read reviews complaining about the behavior of some of the people in the family, but what you have to remember is that this was intended to be a series. Character development takes time, and not everything needs to be revealed all at once. It's a shame that it was canceled before there was time to give more insight about the family.

I knew going in that this was a canceled series and was worried that it would end on a cliffhanger with no good resolution. It doesn't. Everything wraps up nicely in the sixth (and last) episode, in a way that almost makes this more like a miniseries.",1257033600,13,826,4.357142857142857

I am so happy I bought it! It is absolutely brilliant; Hugh's character, Paul, is somewhat of a cross between House and Wooster. I simply adore this show; the first episode in particular is truly hilarious: one of the many high points is when two of Paul's adult sons are fighting over a girl and Paul orders them to go to their rooms. Sex is a major theme throughout the series; one of the running jokes is that Paul can't remember the last time he and his wife have made love while his sons spend most of their time fighting over a pair of sisters. In spite of the sexual elements, I found the show to be refreshingly tasteful, especially compared to the majority of American shows. Further more, its obvious, at least in my opinion,  that in spite of their problems, Paul and his wife were still quite devoted to one another. I'm sorry to say that I'm probably not explaining this show very well, but I can assure you that this is one of the best dvd purchases I've made in a very long time.
