5518224,4,B00AW9M9HQ,"Something strange happens when watching this film. For the first sixteen minutes, there are uncomfortable limitations in the animation that only its spectacular art direction and the detailed textures make it possible to overlook. Too much story information is setting itself up. Far too many characters are introduced. Its tricky to keep track of who is who. The characters names, most of them long and complex, are not repeated enough to learn.

Giving the artists the benefit of the doubt, the plasticity of the character renderings is balanced by the expressive nature of the poses, likely a result of very strong storyboards. But relative weights of characters and objects don't always ring true. The story teeters between been there, done that and should I care, since Im lost anyway.

But then, 16 minutes and 45 seconds into the film, Justin and the Knights of Valor (available on DVD and blu ray on July 22nd via Arc Entertainment) really begins where it should have. Young Justin (voice of Freddie Highmore) starts on his way to the training grounds, first stopping at a pub housing the films most interesting charactersTalia, a likable barmaid (Saoirse Ronan), and Melquaides or Mel (Little Britains David Walliams), a mystic with two personalities.

Mel is the most amusing character in the movie. He talks to his other self  like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, but he can move so fast from one place to another, he often is seen literally as two people. Its a pure animation conceit, and very clever.

When Justin leaves the pub and resumes his journey, this is where films title should come onto the screen. Next, we meet Justins trainers, another set of better-realized characters (voiced by James Cosmo, Charles Dance and Barry Dame Edna Humphries). Though weve been here before in Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and The Karate Kid, the sequence still works, with amusing side gags including a room sized miniature chess-like tableaux that is constantly in danger of being destroyed.

There is no denying that this film feels derivative of How to Train Your Dragon, but it has no genuine magicians, fairies or dragons (except for a ridiculous makeshift fire-breather). Justin must accomplish his quest on his own. The story puts one more in the mind of The Sword in the Stone (T.H. Whites, not Disneys).

The films presenter, Antonio Banderas, gives a fine comic performance in the role of charlatan Sir Clorex, the type of macho buffoon that Patrick Warburton practically patented. But with a few exceptions, the film tends to lean toward characters who are act silly but aren't largely funny. Considering that this was made in todays more sensitive age, its disconcerting there is such a stereotypical character in Sota (Rupert Everett). Did Everett know that his character would be animated in such a mincing, Monty Python way? Sota continues to be a broad caricature in the second half of the film, but his flouncing isn't as pronounced.

No kidding, you could cut out the first 16 minutes and 45 seconds and have a very entertaining motion picture in which most of its shortcomings are less pronounced. All the plot points are repeated and clarified, including a very nice two-dimensional retelling of the story of Justins grandfather. Characters come along when they should, in due timeand their names are given more frequently as the film progresses.

The climactic battle is inevitable and predictable, but nevertheless exciting and suspenseful. Because Justin has to train and learn rather than get assistance from magic or sidekicks, the movie sends a strong message to kids about seeking goals with hard work and no shortcuts.

Ilan Eskeris score is suitably sweeping to buoy the action and breathtaking visuals; a handful of contemporary tunes recall the tunes in Treasure Planet. While incongruous to the storybook setting, the songs are not intrusive. Had this film begun at 16:45, one ballad that provides a heart moment would not slow the film at all, but would only make the viewer more invested in Justins situation.

Watch Justin and the Knights of Valor from the beginning and its a passable diversion with technical issues that are hard to ignore. But watch it from 16:45 and it becomes a more solid film in which its shortcomings are overshadowed by the brisk pace, nicely balanced character interaction, andwhile still not an A-lister by any stretcha handsome and engaging entertainment.",1410566400,2,4443,5.006775067750677

5518230,4,B00AW9M9HQ,"The movie is political and critical of the legal system. After the bad guys were defeated, Knights who protected the kingdom were outlawed, and written laws became abundant as the film ironically states, ""The World is too complex without laws."" Justin's grandfather was a famous knight and his dad is a lawyer. Justin has set out on a quest to become a knight, find his grandfather's lost sword, and court the shallow Lara...whose family invented money. Along the way he meets interesting characters including a wannabe wizard who looks like a stereotypical guy you might meet at a comic book convention.

Then there is the plucky waitress. When Justin tells her he wants a wizard, she replies, ""Would you like fries with that?"" She is the female role model.

There is a side kick who is interested in gossip and fashion, dresses rather nice and prances around.

There are also lines that come from other films or rather spoofs them, such as when a huge man grabs a plank and does his Crocodile Dundee, ""That's not a stick. This is a stick.""

A film the kids will enjoy, but most likely not the one they want to watch multiple times. My 10 year old grand-niece liked it.",1390608000,3,1170,4.63768115942029

8558270,3,B00AW9M9HQ,"Antonio Bandderas has an interesting relationship with computer generated animated feature films.  Not only is he known for playing the attitude-heavy Puss of both DreamWorks Shrek and Puss in Boots fame, hes also a producer for Spains Kandor Graphics.  The name may not mean much to you but to date they have had two domestic CG releases: 2008s The Missing Lynx and 2013s Justin and the Knights of Valor.

The latter was released theatrically in September 2013 in Spain and the United Kingdom followed by a US release on DVD and Blu-ray by ARC Entertainment in 2014.

The story follows the exploits of Justin (Freddie Highmore) in the kingdom of Gabylonia, where lawyers control the populace and knights have been ousted. His dream is to become one of the Knights of Valor, like his grandfather, Sir Roland. But his father Reginald (Alfred Molina), a widower and the chief counsel to the Queen (Olivia Williams), wants his son to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer. After an argument with his father, Justin seeks comfort from his grandmother (Julie Walters), a friend of the Queen, who encourages him to follow his dreams.

Justin embarks on a quest to become a knight. Along the way he meets a feisty girl named Talia (Saoirse Ronan), a barmaid at the Broken Eagle Inn, and a split-personality wizard called Melquiades (David Walliams).  Meanwhile, Justin's grandmother visits the Queen, who tells her that she regrets her decision of ousting the knights.

An armor polisher and small-time thief overhears their conversation and steals some armor to disguise himself as a knight, naming himself Sir Clorex (Antonio Banderas).  About this time Justin begins his training with a trio of monks/ former knights: Braulio (Barry Humphries), an inventor who suffers from nervous attacks when shocked or stressed, Legantir (Charles Dance), a wizard and head monk of the abbey and Blucher (James Cosmo), a knight and an old friend of Sir Roland.

This training would have to be accelerated though as the banished former knight, Sir Heraclio (Mark Strong) and his accomplice Sota (Rupert Everett), have returned from exile and have started gathering an army (composed of people broken out of prison by Sota's brothers) to seek revenge on the Queen for outlawing knights.

If this all sounds a bit complex, it really isnt.  There are more characters than what is generally considered standard in domestic CG animated features of late but the story is never presented in such a way where (even younger) viewers will lose track of the plot progression.

Most of the pacing here follows the very tried-and-true destination method: tasks are presented a single destination at a time while the larger narrative unfolds.  Ultimately the climactic battle between Justin and Sir Heraclio is predictable, but nevertheless exciting and well presented.  Best of all, because Justin has to train to achieve his knighthood, the underlying theme of the film is one of never giving up rather than magical shortcuts or simple diversions.

Of course, while the film is very family friendly and never offensive, it also fails really to take chances or introduce anything new to the fold.  There are moments that harken to what DreamWorks has accomplished in How to Train Your Dragon or Pixar did with Brave but by and large, there isn't much in the way of cleverness or originality here.

Instead, what we do get it is a decent looking, well acted 96-minutes of fantasy romp.  Younger audiences will likely be even more forgiving about the lack of originality but adults, especially those of us spoiled by some of the biggest names in the industry, will likely long for something just a little more special.  At the very least, a bit more comic relief would certainly be welcome.",1487980800,,3762,4.980830670926518

Andrews Blu-ray Review: JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR 3D is a pretty solid animated film in which its shortcomings are overshadowed by a brisk pace, nicely balanced character interaction, and is a handsome and engaging entertainment for all the family.

JUSTIN [Freddie Highmore] lives in a kingdom where bureaucrats rule and knights have been ousted. His dream is to be become one of the Knights of Valour, like his grandfather was, but his father REGINALD [Alfred Molina], the chief counsel to the QUEEN [Olivia Williams], wants his son to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer.

After an inspiring visit to his beloved GRANDMOTHER [Julie Walters] and bidding farewell to his supposed lady-love LARA [Tamsin Egerton], JUSTIN leaves home and embarks on a quest to become a knight. Along the way he meets the beautiful, feisty TALIA [Saoirse Ronan], a quirky wizard called MELQUIADES [David Walliams], the handsome SIR CLOREX [Antonio Banderas] and is mentored by three monks; BLUCHER [James Cosmo], LEGANTIR [Charles Dance] and BRAULIO [Barry Humphries], who teach and test him in the ancient ways of the Knights of Valour.

Whilst an unlikely candidate for knighthood, JUSTIN must rise to the challenge quickly when banished former knight SIR HERACLIO [Mark Strong] and his army, led by SOTA [Rupert Everett], return and threaten to destroy the Kingdom. Young Justin [Freddie Highmore] starts on his way to the training grounds, first stopping at a pub housing the films most interesting characters, like Talia, a likable barmaid [Saoirse Ronan], and Melquaides or Mel [David Walliams], a mystic with two personalities. Melquaides is the most amusing character in the movie. Melquaides talks to his other self  like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, but he can move so fast from one place to another, he often is seen literally as two people. Its a pure animation conceit, and very clever.

When Justin leaves the pub and resumes his journey, this is where films title should come onto the screen. Next, we meet Justins trainers, another set of better-realized characters voiced by James Cosmo, Charles Dance and Barry Dame Edna Humphries. Though weve been here before in Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and The Karate Kid, the sequence still works, with amusing side gags including a room sized miniature chess-like tableaux that is constantly in danger of being destroyed. The other really funny part of this 3D animated film I really enjoyed is the dramatic flying sequence with the crocodile, where you will not believe a crocodile can fly and there is some really clever animation employed in this part of the animated film and you will have to watch the film to find out what happened, but again this sequence was totally hilarious and extremely funny and the animators have been very inventive in how the crocodile performs, especially with Justin hanging on for dear life. There is no denying that this film feels derivative of How to Train Your Dragon, but it has no genuine magicians, fairies or. Justin must accomplish his quest on his own. The story puts one more in the mind of Walt Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone.

Lets start with the animation, there are glimpses of some real talent here, especially in the middle expository sequence where the story of Justins heroic grandfather is finally revealed to him but the rest just isn't up to the standards set by so many Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks features from the past few years. This doesnt mean a company with a smaller budget cannot create a great work, but JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR is very ambitious for a Company based in Granada in Spain, and create large wonderful colourful landscapes with lots of focusing on the more intimate scenes that allow for greater flexibility of all the characters on the screen. In fact, in those small scenes and sequences Justin has a few of his best moments; they are just too few and far between, but despite this situation, I still enjoyed it very much, especially the impressive 3D.

The films presenter, Antonio Banderas, gives a fine comic performance in the role of charlatan Sir Clorex, the type of macho buffoon that Patrick Warburton practically patented. But with a few exceptions, the film tends to lean toward characters who are act silly but aren't largely funny. Considering that this was made in todays more sensitive age, its disconcerting there is such a stereotypical character in Sota [Rupert Everett]. Did Rupert Everett know that his character would be animated in such a mincing way, and Sota continues to be a broad caricature in the second half of the film, but his flouncing isn't as pronounced?

The climactic battle is inevitable and predictable, but nevertheless exciting and suspenseful. Because Justin has to train and learn rather than get assistance from magic or sidekicks, the movie sends a strong message to kids about seeking goals with hard work and no shortcuts. Ilan Eskeris score is suitably sweeping to buoy the action and breath-taking visuals; a handful of contemporary tunes recall the tunes in Treasure Planet.

When watching JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR 3D from the beginning, it is a slow burner, but as the story progresses it really builds up to a really wonderful 3D animated film and it becomes a more solid animated film by the brisk pace, nicely balanced character interaction, and is a handsome and engaging entertainment for all the family. JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR 3D reach new heights once the action is taken to the almighty Tower of Wisdom. Sure, its not the most original name for Knight Headquarters, but characters like Legantir and Blucher add intrigue as Knights who are devoted to finding the next master swordsman and defender of the order. Director Manuel Sicilia delivers with a jolly training montage, which features Justin in full meditation mode with palms to the sky.

With this 3D animated film with the all-star cast with the likes of Antonio Banderas, Freddie Highmore, Charles Dance, Rupert Everett, Julie Walters, Tamsin Egerton, Alfred Molina and David Walliams that really put some effort to make this an enjoyable animated film. Here is an animated story of one young man's quest. It is a tale of dreams, goals and how important it is for parents to listen to children and their dreams for the future. It also tells of friendship, courage, kindness and working together for what is good and just. It has some lovely silly moments that made me laugh and the Madhouse Mini-testers thought that it was a bit like a cross between Mike the Knight and Shrek! Sadly I had actually read some really nasty negative views on this 3D animated film, but I am very confused and I really not know why? Its action packed, funny, with wonderful 3D animation, full of excitement and perfect for the period the 3D animated film is set in.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  Entertainment One presents this beautiful Blu-ray disc in both 3D and 2D versions of the film. Both transfers retain the films original 2.35:1theatrical aspect ratio. The 3D transfer and overall animation on JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR was a pleasant and exciting experience. Animated films usually benefit from the 3D format and this film is no exception. Featuring some amazing layering throughout and some pop out effects which adds to the film, the 3D boasts some impressive immersion and depth. Some particular highlights include the Justin vs Gustav, a brilliant and very funny flying crocodile scene, borrowing the dynamic action from How to Train your Dragon, seeing them fly through the air and crashing into pillars etc., benefits from being viewed in 3D. Long shots in the open fields with mountain ranges in the background also feature superb depth and dimension. Bright bold and colourful throughout, the transfer highlights some of the hard work that has gone into animating it. Small detail like the texture on castle walls, blades of grass on the fields and clothing all exhibit some fine detail that can be observed up close and impress. An impressive observation was the lighting. Scenes were rich with natural sunlight which again, adds to the animation, the finale which was set at dusk was a particular highlight as well. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  Entertainment One presents this beautiful Blu-ray disc with two audio tracks which consist of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. Viewing the film in 3D, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix, the sonics match the quality of the video transfer and results are superb. Featuring a very playful surround mix that takes advantage of the whole soundstage, the rear and front sound effects are very discrete and full of detail with a good example being the detail and aggressiveness of the clashing of swords. The surround speakers are full of activity that creates a active and exciting soundstage throughout. Front speakers are used to full effect as well with some good examples as arrows being fired and using the full speaker setup to pan around the room. The surround mix is used to good effect as well and gives some more impact to the films more action orientated scenes. The only fault I could with the audio mix was that the dialogue was a bit soft which resulted in some.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Making of Justin and the Knights of Valour [2013] [1080i] [1.78:1] [07:04] This features gives us a brief look behind-the-scenes and contributing to this special are Freddie Highmore [Justin]; Manuel Sicilia [Director/Writer]; Alfred Molina [Reginald]; Julie Walters [Gran]; Mark Strong [Heraclio]; Saoirse Ronan [Talia]; James Cosmo [Blucher]; Charles Dance [Legantir]; Rupert Everett [Sota]; Antonio Banderas [Sir Clorex/Producer]; David Walliams [Melquiades]; Ilan Eshkeri [Composer] and Rebeca Ferguson [Performing Heroes]. What is really nice about this special is all who participate explain their part in the animated film and also explain in great detail of what their character is all about. We also get to see lots of behind-the-scene of the making of the animated film and also lots of clips from the animated film.

Special Feature: Making of Animation [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:50] Here you get to view certain parts of the animated film, but with a PIP at the top left hand corner of the animated film of the voice actors in the recording studio, so you can see how the voices were created for the characters in the finished animated film, we also get a split screen feature that briefly intercuts between rehearsals, voice acting and pre-visual of random scenes. We only get to see Antonio Banderas [Sir Clorex] getting very animated in doing his specific over the top voice recording for the character in the animated film. You also get to see two guys fighting with swords and being recorded at the same time to transfer to the animated film.

Special Feature: Making of Sound Design [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:08] Here you get two random clips intercut with behind-the- scenes footage of the recording sessions to get the specific sound effects, first up we see the bells being recorded, lots of different animals being recorded and you also get to see walls being smashed to get the effect of the walls crashing.

Special Feature: Production Progress [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:04] Here we get to view the rough cut progress reels of key scenes from sketches, Pre-visual to the final rendered animated film.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:44] Here we get a collection of four deleted scenes that were removed before final rendering of the animated film took place and they also feature a temp sound mix and are time coded and they include Justins Dream; Justin Going To His cell; Arrival at Laras House and Justins Trip With Laras Shots. You can of course either watch them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Cast and Crew Interviews [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1] [61:20] This is a rather surprising special feature on the disc. Just over an hours worth of very in depth interviews from key cast and crew that is available to view in one sitting or you can select which cast or crew member you would prefer to watch. But the actual people you get to hear from with their personal views are Antonio Banderas [Sir Clorex]; Freddie Highmore [Justin]; James Cosmo [Blucher]; Charles Dance [Legantir]; Rupert Everett [Sota]; Barry Humphries [Braulio]; Alfred Molina [Reginald]; Mark Strong [Heraclio]; David Walliams [Melquiades]; Julie Walters [Gran]; Saoirse Ronan [Talia]; Manuel Sicilia [Director/Writer]; Rebeca Ferguson [Singer]; Ilan Eshkeri [Composer] and Javier Fernndez [Director of Photography]. Out of all the extras, I found this very interesting, as it was great to hear every ones personal and intimate views and what the voice cast thought of their characters and how they all enjoyed working on the animated film, as well as working with people behind-the-scenes who worked on the animated film JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR 3D.

Blu-ray Preview Trailers: FREE BIRDS 3D [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:20]; TARZAN 3D [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:05]; GNOMEO AND JULIET 3D [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:35] and A MONSTER IN PARIS 3D [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:33].

Finally, JUSTIN AND THE KNIGHTS OF VALOUR 3D certainly has great heart in the right place and does contain some moral messages for the younger viewers, so it does come highly recommended, but it also has some hilarious comedy moments for the adult audiences. On the plus side though, the Blu-ray disc features a superb audio and 3D video transfer throughout and a surprisingly good set of bonus features that does give this release a lot of merit, which I am glad I have added to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!
