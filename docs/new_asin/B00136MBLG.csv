8249311,3,B00136MBLG,"I hadn't intended to review videos including this type, but after having bought this sight unseen and after watching it I thought that there are things a potential buyer should know, so I'm writing this. Before I begin, I should mention that I like to learn about all subjects so I own a number of educational dvds like this one. If you prefer x-rated movies to educational dvds like this, then you won't find anything to suit you in this one. However, if you are more open minded, then you might find something of value here but I still want to qualify that with the following comments. First a summary of some of the contents which I found useful.

The parts I liked while basic were the relationship advice such as: if you want a good relationship, you need good communication; creating a setting, taking care of you health, having the right attitude, e.g. not being goal oriented, making and taking time to create a lasting relationship, creating variety with the same partner. One other thing I liked was their saying that people have different styles of demonstrating their feelings toward their partner and just because your style is different from your partner's doesn't mean they don't care about you, e.g. some demonstrate in a material way by giving gifts or taking their partner places, some demonstrate verbally and some nonverbally. I wish my last girlfriend understood that when I tried to explain this idea. Below is what I felt the subtitle of this dvd, ""Simple tantra for couples"" misrepresented:

-Whatever tantra teaching there is in this tape is weak at best. If you want tantra or the similar tao tapes, stick with the Alexander and Sinclair Institute's dvds. This tape is also dated. The copyright at the end of the dvd is 1989.

-Much of this tape appears to have been videotaped at some kind of lecture. There is an audience, and the hosts, Jonathan Robinson, M.A. and Suzanne Rapley, PhD., who are bright and professional looking, spend most of the dvd lecturing to or entertaining the audience. For example, they have a mock awards ceremony for the most underrated erogenous zone: is it the ear, voice, feet, head or mind? Can you guess which? The fact that the hosts are therapists rather than tantra teachers may explain this dvd's style. I did look up the hosts. Mr. Robinson has a website and has published several books which may again explain this dvd's style.

-I like dvds of this type with real life couples as opposed to actors. The credits at the end of the dvd give the names of the couples. One of the names comes up on IMDB so he is a professional actor. Thus, I can only assume these are not real life couples.

-While the couples are attractive and there is nudity, they are not as erotic atleast by my personal preferences as in similar tapes. The couples seem to have been intentionally chosen for that appearance because the tape makes great effort not to expose anything. So while there is some body contact, it is not explicit by my definition despite the word ""explicit"" on the box. It looks to me simulated.

-Lastly, when I first opened the box, I thought I was sent the wrong dvd because the title on the dvd says ""Babaji's Sanatan Dharma"" whatever that is, but the contents of the dvd do correspond to the title on the box.

So if you collect these kind of dvds and you can find this at a cheap price (less than $10) and you are satisfied with some basic education, then you might consider buying it. Otherwise, I suggest some of the other, better dvds on the market. Note this distributor Lightworks has one other similar titled tape, ""Tantric secrets of sacred sex: a guide to intimacy and loving"" which I think is a great tape of this type, one of my favorites.

Finally, if Amazon doesn't object to my saying this, so far I have not found a female partner interested in tantric or the similar taoist ideas both of which are better presented in the dvds from the other mfrs. I mention above. So if there is any single woman in my age range, 50s-60s, who lives in the NYC metro area and is looking for a relationship with a partner (I'm SWM and I look younger than my age 60) and would like to talk to me about these ideas, please e-mail me at this e-mail: taotantra1@yahoo.com.
