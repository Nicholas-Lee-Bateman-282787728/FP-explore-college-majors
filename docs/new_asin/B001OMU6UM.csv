3730972,5,B001OMU6UM,"Bolt believes he is the character from his TV show because the producers think this makes him the most emotion filled and believable animal actor ever seen. Penny, his person, and the heroine from the show wants Bolt to be able to be a real dog and come home with her for the weekend. The money grubbing agent of course will have nothing to do with that idea.

The network says that research shows Bolt is too predictable and is boring people in their target age group. Penny gets in trouble and Bolt always saves her. So they put in a twist, Penny gets in trouble and Bolt doesn't save her. After the show Penny is panicked because they won't let her see Bolt, and she knows he's going to be freaking out thinking she is in trouble, which of course he is. He gets out of his trailer, hits his head trying to escape the building and is knocked unconscious into a box of pink Styrofoam and gets shipped to New York.

When he wakes up, he is searching for Penny, and doesn't know he's not on the set and doesn't have super powers. The contrast of his belief he is a superhero with real life sets up lots of funny scenes throughout the movie. He meets some pigeons, which is a reoccurring theme in the movie. The pigeons always have a pronounced accent and clear local sayings and behaviors that are quite funny. These pigeons introduce him to a jaded cat named Mittens that Bold believes works for the villain from the TV show. She explains to him that he has to get from New York to California to find Penny. Against her wishes they set off across country to find Penny.

They pick up a funny hamster in a ball on the way named Rhino. He's a huge fan of Bolt's TV show and that is how Mittens, and eventually Bolt figure out that he's not truly a superhero. There are so many funny scenes that it may be in the Disney humor realm with the greats like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-10th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0009MAO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsters-Inc-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsters, Inc.

I'll need to see it a few more times to know for sure, but it's at least close.

There are of course several tear jerking scenes as Bolt discovers he is just a dog, the truth about Mittens and when he thinks Penny doesn't really love him. But in true Disney fashion, he rises above his limitations and is more than he knows. The ending is great, and the pigeons make a final appearance indicating what part of the country they're in.

This is a movie I preordered because I will enjoy it as much as my children, and when they watch it every day in the car for two weeks, I'll laugh at the lines right along with them.",1233619200,2,3200,5.441532258064516
3730973,4,B001OMU6UM,"A story about a dog that stars in a TV show but doesn't know it. In the TV show, Bolt is a cyber dog with super speed, strength and a powerful bark (literally.) Bolt is kept securely on the studio lot and great pains are taken to ensure that he never finds out that the TV world isn't the real one.

When Bolt accidentally gets shipped across country and has to make his way back home he enlists the aid of a crazy rodent and a captive cat. Adventure and mayhem ensue.

The great voice acting and animation make this an easy to watch movie even though the story is the usual fare dressed up in a sci-fi package. The action doesn't ever hit a lull so even adults can enjoy this movie. (PS: the kids love it.)

I highly recommend this film.",1233360000,,738,4.146853146853147
3730974,5,B001OMU6UM,"Mittens: [to Bolt] The real world hurts, doesn't it?

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Bolt (John Travolta) is a pup with super strength, laser vision, and all the other good stuff that comes with the portfolio of ""superhero""
2. That is, once he's on the movie set of his hit series
3. He's never been off the movie set
4. He's totally devoted to his owner Penny (the ubiquitous Miley Cyrus)
5. Unforeseen script changes force him to perform a rescue, this time in the real world.
6. One word - Kryptonite
7. He captures a savvy alley cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and commands her to take him to her leader.
8. Hilarious adventures continue, thanks to some wacky pigeons and a scene stealing hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton)

This largely unappreciated, overlooked gem of a movie from Disney is perfect for kids and animal lovers everywhere.

Vinnie (a pigeon): You gotta gimme something here, cause this is redonkulous.
Bobby (another pigeon): Absolutely redonkulous!

Rated: 4.5 stars

3730982,5,B001OMU6UM,"This is a memorable movie. For super-dog Bolt (John Travolta), every day is filled with adventure, danger and intrigue - at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the canine star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet - a cross-country journey through the real world. He soon discovers that something is wrong when he is unable to use his amazing powers.

This is Disney's 48th animated feature. Bolt resembles a white German Shepherd. The design of Rhino in his plastic ball was based on co-producer John Lassetter's pet chinchilla.",1509148800,,623,4.933333333333334

3731145,4,B001OMU6UM,"To my way of reasoning, 2008 represented a pretty interesting time in computer generated animation as Disney found itself in the tail-end of an identity crisis in effort to differentiate themselves from Pixar.  A mere two years prior (Jan of 2006), the two companies merged but this came after several tumultuous years of failed negotiations, to the point where Pixar threatened to seek distribution elsewhere.  As a result of this period, Disney released several substandard CG films in part to show the general public that it was vested in the emerging media but also surely to prove to Pixar that they could make a go of it with or without them.

Among these we got The Wild, Chicken Little, Valiant, Meet the Robinsons and Bolt.  Yes its 2008 release places it well after the merger but the average development cycle for a CG feature film is 4 years.  Not to mention it is well known that in 2006, after having become the Chief Creative Officer at Disney, John Lasseter (along with other directors from Pixar) viewed early cuts of Bolt and provided then-director Chris Sanders notes on how to improve the story. According to Lasseter, Sanders was actually replaced on the project because of his resistance to the changes that Lasseter and the other directors had suggested.

Anyway, looking back on Bolt now, it bears the unique distinction of feeling equal parts original Disney and Disney-Pixar collaborated.  It introduced the non-photo-realistic rendering (NPR) style that would go on to define the look of Disney CG pieces like Tangled and Frozen; which in essence combines life-like animation cycles against backgrounds that almost look hand-painted.  It's also rife with charming animal emotion/ expressiveness but with a story just clever enough to suggest the Pixar school of influence.

Bolt tells the story of a celebrity canine, left purposely in the dark to the concept that prime-time television is in fact fictitious for the sake of getting authentic emotion, who is dropped into the real world and forced to fend for himself not only unprepared but unaware of the simple reality that he is, in fact, just an ordinary dog.

Of course by ""the real world"", we mean the beautifully rendered digital real world where animals have the ability to talk to one an other but oblivious humans hear only barking, squeaking meowing etc.

Celebrity dog Bolt, voiced by real-life celebrity John Travolta, encounters the rough and tumble realities that lurk beyond the walls of the studio set accompanied by a cynical abandoned cat (Susie Essman) named Mittens and overzealous hamster-in-a-ball named Rhino (Mark Walton).

In the end he learns a thing or two about the true measure of a man, er I mean a dog and that the definition of a hero entails much more than simple props and special effects.

Perhaps the piece's greatest strength lies in the fact that its laced with satire that adult viewers will appreciate while the kids clamor to the clean visuals and adorable animals.  In NY City Bolt encounters a trio of pigeons copied and pasted from Brooklyn's mean streets, in LA he must contend with aspiring screenwriter birds with lame ideas and too much enthusiasm.  As his journey across the continental US is based upon a children's map from restaurant chain Waffle World, we are given a glimpse into the comings and goings of Waffle World patrons on a state-by-state basis.

The pacing is brisk, with scenes never meandering around aimlessly or dialog extending past what's necessary to get the point across.  While I prefer this to the opposite type of exposition (one that feels longer than expected or a plot that develops casually), it does feel a tad concise as only can be delivered by countless corporate board meetings and story board sessions to make every onscreen dollar spent count ala Disney or DreamWorks.

All in all Bolt is an enjoyable trip to take for viewers of all ages even now, some 7-years after its initial theatrical run.  At the end of the day it strikes all the right chords yet somehow doesn't quite capture the majesty or mastery of the craft as had been expected from contemporary Pixar; perhaps explaining why it had been nominated for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, which it would go on to lose to Pixar's WALL-E.  Apparently Disney realized a simple reality that still holds true today: They can't lose by having Lasseter compete with himself.",1424304000,,4408,4.923076923076923

3731152,4,B001OMU6UM,"The premise is amusing, a TV dog named Bolt who thinks he has super powers until he's forced to face facts through a rash of `real' life situations as he sets out to save his owner Penny.  Somehow, this dog is mailed coast to coast before he's belatedly discovered (let out of a box with no air holes..............).  From that point on, the movie turns from drab and boring to frantic and fun as a cat named Mittens is forced to join Bolt on his quest.  Things really pick up with the addition of a super-fan/hamster named Rhino.  When this movie sticks to the antics of these three animals it soars.  When it deals with fake TV scenes and the obnoxious agent it sputters and stalls.  Considering the number of rewrites it went through, and the change in directors and direction, I would have expected more consistency in plot.  (The changes were implemented by John Lasseter who gave the original writer/director Chris Sanders the boot.)  Sanders went to work for the competition, DreamWorks.  Beware of who you kick out the door.  Sanders has since worked on How to Train Your Dragon (2 and 3 also) and The Croods (working on The Croods 2).  Success elsewhere is the best revenge.",1421280000,,1183,4.6124401913875595

She jumps on our bed and has her eyes glued to the tube. Well, we both watched Bolt and we were so glad we purchased this movie. We didn't want to pause it and run to the kitchen for a snack as we were so involved in this cute movie. I liked it that they had John Travolta as Bolts voice over. Mylie Cyrus they could have left out of the movie and someone else to do Penny the little girl. Not a Mylie Cyrus lover what so ever as she does not have a good reputation. But what I liked about the movie was how Penny showed a great concern for her little dog. Now, in the movie it is said that Bolt really wasn't her dog, but Daphne and I failed to believe this. Penny really loves that little dog. It's a good movie for kids and even pets. The movie shows how much love a pet can bring to all of us and how a child can learn to care for their pet. Penny never gives up on finding Bolt.
Anyway, Daphne gives this movie a 4 paws up. You will have to see this movie. I can see why it has such high rating and it well deserves those high ratings.",1393286400,,1193,3.9135802469135803

3731211,4,B001OMU6UM,"Perfectly average entertainment as far as I am concerned, but my girls (five and eight) both seem to adore this one. The star score is an average.

The premise is intriguing enough: TV Hero dog thinks he is actually a hero and has to cope in the real world when he is accidently shipped across country in a FedEx box (don't ask...). There are some fun characters: the pigeons in particular, but the main supporting cast of the cat and the hamster grate on my nerves pretty quickly, if in benign ways. The human characters, bit players ultimately, are either bland or annoying (the latter intentionally, I think). The music is most definitely C-list, but not so bad as to need to cover your ears - again, mostly just bland.

My girls, on the other hand, find this very entertaining and think the hamster is a riot. And since there is nothing here I particularly object to, other than the blandness, I don't kick when they want to watch it once in a while. I just do something else, generally.",1392163200,4,991,4.5

Bolt is the story of a dog, played by John Travolta, who is the star of a TV show who believes in all his heart he is a super dog, which leads to all kinds of adventures due to accidently being shipped to New York City. Bolt runs into an Alley cat named mittens, played wonderfully by Susie Essman, and plan a return to Hollywood to return to his person named Penny, played by Miley Cyrus. There's also a fanboy hamster named Rhino is one of the best kicks in any Disney movie i've seen. Malcolm McDowell Plays a great villain Dr Calico, plus Greg Germann as the sleazy agent, both great roles.

(I would have lowered the rating because I am rather sick of it, since she watches it over and over, but that wouldn't be fair..) That said, she got a lot out of our discussions about the plot of the movie and how television and movies are made. Bolt is a dog actor, playing a super-hero dog in a TV series and he is unaware (because the director has carefully hidden the truth) that he is just an average dog, playing a part. There is some violence, in the show within the movie, and the dog's owner is almost killed in a fire, towards the end, but by then, she was pretty sure the real Bolt will prevail, and be even better than the fantasy one.",1358985600,,743,4.23943661971831

My kids love this movie.  In fact, I think it rates as one of their top 5 all-time favorites.  I suppose it helps that the main character is a dog - both boys and girls seem to relate well to animal movies.

However, what I think really makes this movie great is its adherence to the traditional hero quest.  Bolt is separated from his home and undergoes an initiation before returning and saving the day.  In this case, I think that the writers did an excellent casting job casting a cat in the position of the teacher (Yoda) and the hamster as companion (Chewbacca).

What's that you say?  This reviewer has flown the coop?  What's all this Yoda nonsense?  Be still your beating heart my friends and read Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.  Or - perhaps just watch the PBS interview with Bill Moyers (even though Moyers is generally a raving fool). That pretty much explains it.  Note that the movie Spirit (about the horse) follows basically the same pattern.  Separation, initiation, return.

Bolt also follows a Wizard of Oz pattern in the way he follows the map of pancake houses (yellow brick road) to his destination.  In this case, Oz being Hollywood.

Bolt is really interesting because it handles the hero development in reverse - rather than leaving home to learn some mystical skill, Bolt does the opposite.  He is a superhero to begin with, only to leave home and discover his life is a lie.  Bolt's separation from home results in his transformation into a normal dog, not a super dog (unlike a character like Luke Skywalker for instance).  However, the beauty of this movie is that Bolt is a ""hero"" regardless.  You could argue that in some ways, Bolt perhaps does become a super dog of sorts - he goes from a make-believe hero to a real one.

My black lab is a super dog too.  Her super power is eating entire loaves of bread off the kitchen counter.  She also hunts mice - kind of strange for a dog, but she is pretty good at it.

All that aside, I highly recommend this movie to families with children 10 and under.  We have watched pretty much every movie available for kids and this one ranked in the top 5 for sure.

My 8 year old daughter tears up at the end.  Bolt's last ""super bark"" does her in every time.  It's like Bolt's ""Rudy"" moment.

When you get to the end... and see the super bark scene I'm talking about... a tear will slip down you cheek and, and that moment, the moment in which your beating little heart opens up to all the emotion in the world, you will remember this review from Amazon and you will remember the name MoonDonkey...and your heart will sing... thank you MoonDonkey...thank you MoonDonkey... thank you...  And at that point, like a crack in a dam,  the waters will flow and the pent up tears of all your years will gush forth as you drop your cheeks into your hands, fall to your knees, and surrender the hardness of your dark and evil adult heart to the long-lost innocence of your childhood.",1322006400,3,3099,4.468805704099822

3731322,5,B001OMU6UM,"I've now seen Bolt twice, once in 2D and now in 3D; both times we found the movie to be a heartwarming adventure that focuses on the triumph of good over evil and the great importance of friends and faithful love.

The movie is really fun to watch and picks up the viewers and carries them along for a fast paced adventure across the entire United States. The sound and picture are both excellent and the 3D version is very effective. The 3D version is presently only available through Sony for purchasers of a Sony 3D TV. That is similar to the Panasonic program which offers Avatar in 3D to purchasers of a Panasonic 3D TV. I suspect they will both be available for general purchase within a year or so.

The story is of a girl and her dog that just happens to hit the big time in Hollywood as stars of an adventure series, but are then separated by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The story follows the adventures of the dog, Bolt, who is devoted to his beloved girl and determined to find her again.

Bolt's life is complicated by one awkward misconception; he has come to believe that the special effects wonders he performs on stage are all real; he believes he can really do all of those miraculous things he appears to do courtesy of the special effects and stage props.

During his journey home he encounters all sorts of adventures which teach him the reality of his personal strengths and weaknesses and the value of friendship.

3731336,5,B001OMU6UM,"I'm going to go out on a HUGE limb here and say that the film that should have won that 2008 Oscar for Best Animated Feature was `Bolt'.  I know, I know; `Wall-E' is wonderful, but for me that particular film falls a bit short with it's unoriginal and wildly clichd ending (besides, of Pixar's three year winning streak, `Wall-E' was BY FAR the weakest link).  `Bolt', while not free from its own set of clichs, never once disappointed me.  I laughed, I cried, I was concerned, I was intrigued, I was tense, I was jovial; everything I could have ever wanted in a cartoon (NO, never use that word) was found in `Bolt'.

The film tells the story of Bolt, a television super-dog who doesn't realize he isn't really a super-dog.  He has been raised to fully believe he has superpowers and that his `person' Penny is truly in danger.  So, when the television studio takes a risk and decides to leave the audience with a cliffhanger (Penny's capture by the evil Dr. Calico), Bolt escapes into the real world in order to rescue Penny himself.

Once in the real world, Bolt soon realizes that he is far from the super-dog he thought he was.  What he learns though, is that he is an even bigger super-dog than the television show let-on.

This lovely little film definitely wins points for addressing the emptiness of celebrity without every going over the top (""nope, never seen him before in my life"").  It also would certainly make PETA very happy with its stern take on the abandonment of animals (I actually teared up during Mittens' big reveal).  At heart though, this film is all about the power of love and loyalty (dogs are noted for their loyalty).  The film teaches the valuable lesson that, if we believe, we can achieve.  Bolt suffers a huge blow when he realizes his powers are fake, but the real power he possesses is his heart, and that `weapon' is more powerful than any super-bark could be.

The film manages to evoke a lot of emotional responses, and it understands how to make everything fit together well.  The film has its intense moments, which could be a tad scary for kids, but the overall feel to the film is a jovial and heartwarming one.  The films opening is particularly well done (it's like a movie inside a movie), but the high opening doesn't give way to any sort of a let-down.

The film just keeps getting better and better.

The voice work here is also great.  John Travolta has a voice suited for this kind of work.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Miley is rather unrecognizable, but whatever (she's not really in the film too much).  For me, the standouts were Mark Walton and Susie Essman.  They were hysterical, and Essman had the right amount of earnestness to make her character's arc truly touching.

Yes, this film has its share of clichs (I mean, Rhino is a clich in himself, but a really funny one), and the Hollywoodized happy ending was expected (this is a film about Hollywood in a way) but it is also totally welcome here.  This film embraces and embellishes its own faults to make something beautiful out of them.

John Travolta does an incredible job and (surprisingly) Miley Cyrus does an excellent job with her character Penny. The supporting voice actors are equally as superb as their superstar counter-parts.

Rhino, the hamster, is by far the most fully awesome character to appear in a Disney movie in a long, long time!! I recommend this movie to everyone! We all need a good laugh sometimes and you will definitely be laughing when you hear a tiny hamster say ""SABOTEUR!"" Or when a New York City Pigeon says ""You got your head stuck pretty good, huh guy? Oh yeah, that is one stuck melon!""

I have no doubt that almost every child who watches this movie will love it! On the other hand, most adults scoff at the idea of watching a ""kid's movie"".

3731357,4,B001OMU6UM,"Take Homeward Bound's tale of three pets drawn together on an epic journey across America, mix in Toy Story's winking sense of irony at the faux world of toys, shroud it in the artificially-created world of The Truman Show and you've got Bolt.

Bolt (John Travolta) is a clueless acting dog who truly loves his ""person,"" Penny (Miley Cyrus). In the movies, Bolt is a superhero, but Bolt doesn't quite grasp that he's actually in a movie.  When audiences begin to tire of Bolt's heroics, the network decides to throw in a twist and separate Penny from Bolt.  Distraught and determined, Bolt escapes the studio in a quest to rescue Penny from Hollywood.

Along the way, he meets a street savvy cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and a chubby fanboy gerbil named Rhino (Mark Walton).  Rhino's a lot like Kung Fu Panda's Po - overweight, hopelessly consumed by fandom, and relentlessly optimistic. Mittens, on the other hand, is the Bones equivalent; a beaten down cynic who thinks Bolt is completely insane.

Bolt is at its best during the film-within-a-film sequences; the motorcycle chase scene is just as thrilling as the one in Terminator Salvation.  The catch is that though it's not real, the violence takes place on screen.  In other words, does it really matter if CGI actors are pretending to be CGI dead? Helicopters explode, motorcycles flip, and bad guys don't get back up.  In that regard, Bolt's pretty violent.

Where Michael J. Fox voice perfectly embodied Chance in Homeward Bound as a young pup, Travolta's throaty whisper seems an odd choice for Bolt, who's at least as clueless as Chance. He does a great job, but occasionally you can hear the weariness and maturity in his voice.

Occasionally, the movie glosses over its own moral arc; although it's critical for Bolt to reunite with his person and Mittens still nurses her own emotional wounds over the loss of her family, Rhino leaves his old lady without nary a look back.  It's never mentioned that she might miss him.

But those are minor quibbles.  Overall, Bolt's an entertaining, fast-moving action picture.  It's just not on par with Toy Story as a parable that younger kids can enjoy.",1252713600,,2161,4.834239130434782

3731361,1,B001OMU6UM,"Okay, I had very high hopes for this movie. The previews made it look funny and great, boy were they wrong! First off, the intro may seem actiony.... if you're a 5 year old. We all know that this action sequence is part of the tv show, we know that because in the trailer it said that he was a tv dog. The beginning sequence just seemed like it dragged on and on. When he finnaly gets out into the real world, he meets a cat named Mittens and a hampster named Rhino (Who is the only humor in the movie). It just seems like this drags on and on. It was boring in every single way! My parents were watching this with me, and we kept looking at each other thinking ""Um, when is it going to get good?"". Finally, we get a good REAL action sequence where Bolt saves Penny from a fire. This is the only part of the movie that was touching and had me crying. After that, the ending just showed how pathetic the TV studio was (They tried to do a new epi of the Bolt TV show with a new dog and girl. Epic fail btw) And the cat and hampster end up getting adopted by Penny which was sweet even though you can see it coming a mile away.

What happened to you Disney? You had great films, and now this. This film was as boring as Night at the Museum, and what's worse, they had to cast freakin Miley Cyrus to play Penny, not only that but they use some of her songs! UGH! Also, they stole the plot, from one of their own movies! They stole the TV Dog going into the real world plot from 101 Dalmations 2: Patch's London Adventure (Great Movie). Honestly, stealing your own plots, making boring movies, creating Hannah Montana?! Walt is probably rolling in his grave.

Oh, but it gets better! In the mini movie, Super Rhino, Rhino the Hampster has a dream that he now has super powers and has to save Penny and Bolt. It got a couple snickers out of me, but the end is a WTF moment. After he saves Penny and Bolt, Rhino takes an elevator the leads to a stage where he starts singing ""The Best of Both Worlds"" by freakin Hannah Montana! WTF?! Disney, why the heck are you advertising your lame sitcoms during a mini movie! I just can not get over that!

I'm sorry Disney, but only a couple snickers thanks to a hampster, and one touching moment out of 130 minutes is not going to cut it. If you want a fun, funny, and actiony family flick, go see Monsters Vs Aliens.

3731363,4,B001OMU6UM,"This is a Disney animated dog tale that has the voices of John Travolta (Bolt), Miley Cyrus (Penny), Susie Essman (Mittens), Mark Walton (Rhino) and Chloe Moretz.

A puppy is adopted by a child star by the name of Penny.  She evidently went to the pet shop with the casting director for a TV show about super-dog hero Bolt.

Penny and Bolt make a great duo and the TV Show is a hit.  We soon realize that Bolt is delusional about what super feats he can do.  He is kept isolated and brought out of his star trailer only when they need to shoot scenes for a show.  He is a great actor because he believes everything he does is real, including fantastic feats and dog power - down to an amazing bark that shakes or blows away everything around him.  He does not realize it is all special effects.  In his mind, he is ""Bolt - the Super Hero Dog"".

The story gets interesting when Bolt escapes into the real world.  Bolt escapes his trailer chasing movie cats - and somehow ends up in a packing box and arrives on the East Coast.  A cross country adventure starts with Mittens the homeless cat and Rhino the Hamster that loves TV shows.  They have a wonderful adventure when they help Bolt come back to his owner and co-star Penny.

3731366,4,B001OMU6UM,"Disney's ""Bolt"" is about a dog of the title with incredible superpowers. Bolt is always there to aid his master, a girl named Penny, whose father is kidnapped by an evil organization led by Dr. Calico. Brave and strong Bolt never fails Penny, saves her from danger, using his great powers. But there is one thing Bolt doesn't know: the world he thinks is real is actually the set of a TV show made in Hollywood.

Things change drastically, however, when Bolt is accidentally sent to New York City. This is the beginning of the real adventures for him and two animals he meets on the way, a cat named Mittens and a hamster named Rhino, and on the way home Bolt's courage will be tested.

The film's story is a blend of ""The Truman Show"" and any films featuring a dog coming back to his/her home - like two classics ""Lassie Come Home"" and ""Incredible Journey"" - and it works with good narrative pace and first-rate visuals. The best part of the film is the fast-paced, thrilling film-within-film segment, the hair-raising ""Bolt"" show where you can see Bolt running like a real super-dog should do. (One character says the ratings of ""Bolt"" are falling. I just don't believe that.)

Despite its unique premises about the TV show and its canine star, the storyline of ""Bolt"" is orthodox, just like any good family pictures. I only wish that we could see more of Bolt and Penny sharing scenes together (I find the second half of the film, in which Bolt and Penny are separated, is weaker). One or two more episodes from ""Bolt"" will be welcomed.",1249689600,,1539,4.568840579710145

I had pretty neutral expectations of this movie only to find my level of satisfaction rather high at the end.

It reminded me a great deal of 'The Brave Little Toaster' from back in the day, but is otherwise a classic tale of a motley crew finding friendship and making their way home again.

To be sure, Rhino was the sneak-away star of the movie, but that in no way diminishes the other animal characters.

I finally rented it for my son, and now we plan on purchasing it. The story is about a dog, Bolt, who is raised on-set, so he thinks the TV show being filmed is real. Everyone that has anything to do with the TV series goes out of their way to make sure that Bolt never finds out the truth. They want his reactions to be genuine.

The problem arises when they take it too far, and Bolt is convinced that ""his person"" Penny has been kidnapped. He ends up lost off-set, but meets other animals that help him get back to Hollywood.

The pigeons were awesome. They had different dialects, depending on where they lived, but these animatede versions had all the nautral clicks that real pigeons do (ex: the weird way they shift their eyes).

The pigeons lead Bolt to a stray cat, Mittens, who he believes is in league with the bad guy. Bolt also meets, Rhino, a hamster who watches too much TV and thinks Bolt's character is real. Mittens tries to explain reality to Bolt and Rhino, but to no avail.

The three of them travel together to Hollywood, with Mittens teaching Bolt how to be a regular pet, and Bolt discovering that Mittens used to be a pet herself.  By the time they arrive at the studio, the dynamic of the group has changed. Eventually, Bolt is reunited with Penny, but they are soon trapped by a very real studio fire.

Of course, there is a happy ending. There is also a cute short with Rhino, who pays homage to Hannah Montana, which is amusing since Miley Cyrus is Penny's voice.

Along the way, he meets and befriends a cat, some pigeons and a hamster that is part wolf and part wolverine. This motley group faces fears, old resentments and overwhelming odds with faith and determination and along they way they find friendship and learn a lesson in forgiveness and overcoming bitterness. And the audience is treated to both hilarity and tenderness in this well-told story. Plus, you'll get to hear the touching and very singable Jenny Lewis song, ""Barking at the Moon"".

3731388,5,B001OMU6UM,"It's almost unfair for BOLT that it has to follow all these other animated kid classics from Pixar and Disney. Otherwise, I think this film garners even more props. As it is, the word on BOLT is strong and very positive. I personally think it ranks up there with the likes of A BUG'S LIFE, MONSTERS, INC., FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES, WALL-E and the TOY STORY flicks. BOLT is ideally suited for children, with its flawless visuals, relatable humor, and its sweet message. Yet it's sophisticated enough that the grown-ups will walk away also having had a great time.

The cute opening scene shows us how Penny comes to choose the tail-waggly, slobbery puppy Bolt at the Animal Rescue shelter. Cut to five years later, and Bolt has become a huge television star. His show features him as a super-powered canine caught up in secret agent shenanigans. It's a popular show, but the network wants to amp it up even more. Accordingly, the latest television escapade climaxes with Penny being kidnapped. This gets us to the meat of the plot.

Bolt makes his residence on the Hollywood movie lot; he has in fact never been out in the real world. And here's the thing. Bolt believes that all this secret agent stuff is real, believes that he has super powers and that Penny has been really kidnapped. Frantic to rescue his person, Bolt breaks out of his studio trailer and so plonks himself straight into real life.

From this point on, the movie follows a tried and true storyline, that of the devoted pet finding its way back home, this particular trek adhering to a New York to L.A. itinerary. The existential twist here, of course, is that Bolt is so very convinced that he has these extraordinary attributes; he thinks that he really is super-strong and has laser vision and a super-bark - and it takes most of the film to resolve this identity crisis. There's a lot of fun for the audience as the film at first lets Bolt down easy. Each time he tries to apply a super-power and it fails him, circumstances surface which offer him a credible explanation (the uber-explanation being the sinister presence of styrofoam packing peanuts, which Bolt comes to regard as his kryptonite). The story then also becomes about Bolt gradually relaxing and learning what it's like to be a real dog, so wrapped up was he before in his fake reality. Voiced terrifically by John Travolta (and I didn't even know it was Travolta 'til the end credits rolled around), Bolt is an instantly endearing lead. There's a streak of sentimentality which runs thru the film, but what really lends texture are Bolt's key supporting characters and those side characters, and specifically Bolt's initially adversarial relationship with Mittens, the street-savvy alley cat and Bolt's polar opposite in character traits. Bolt is all optimism and sort of brandishes this sense of entitlement, while Mittens is the cynical, world-weary vagabond surviving on her wits. When we first meet Mittens, she's shaking down pigeons for food scraps. I liked her right away. I guess it's only karma that Bolt and Mittens eventually end up muy sympatico.

Miley Cyrus is good (but underused) as Penny, but the awesome surprises are Susie Essman as Mittens and Mark Walton as Rhino, the enthusiastic chubby hamster sidekick rolling around in a bubble - and both are wicked scene stealers. Mittens is wonderfully snide, while Rhino is, well, the hamster's insane, almost disturbingly so (and yet I couldn't stop laughing at his lines and antics). I couldn't help snickering at one scene, in which Bolt and Rhino, having infiltrated an animal shelter to rescue Mittens, are peeking at a security guard - and Rhino offers to snap the guard's neck. Hah! And if you're looking for more hamstery fun, included in the single DVD is the 4-minute animated short ""Super Rhino"" which has Rhino gaining super powers. Also fun are that pair of ""evil"" cats and, omigosh, those New York pigeons (these are the side characters I mentioned).

It's a given that Bolt will reunite with Penny, Disney wasn't gonna mess with that formula. But, to echo that one maxim, the fun is in the journey. The meat of the story is during the road trip, rife as it is with surprises, laugh out loud humor, and some sweet, heartwarming moments. And, because BOLT also caters to adult sensibilities, sly references are dropped regarding Hollywood and its shady citizens (the most absolutely annoying of whom is Penny's agent).

One highlight (of many) is the exhilarating, exquisitely choreographed first eleven minutes which owe something to THE MATRIX and demonstrate Bolt's impressive ""super powers"" (including an impeccably delivered karate punch *snicker*). The time lapse stuff is very cool, and I even liked that one small touch of an explosion causing a distant soda papercup to slowly keel over. I saw the ending coming a mile away, but by that time the movie had already worked its magic on me, so I didn't even mind the clichd feel of it. BOLT follows on the heels of exceptional animated children's films and, like those other films, it is slick yet full of heart, is sophisticated yet retains a sense of wonder, is amiably goofy but also witty. BOLT sparks the imagination, but also reduces you to one of those folks who sickeningly go ""Gaga googoo"" at precious babies or ""Aww! Who's a good boy?"" at cute puppies. And is that what happened to me during this film, you ask? Ruefully, I say, ""Yes, dammit.""",1242864000,,5430,4.827067669172933

You can tell that Pixar guru: Lasseter has begun to leave make his mark in Disney Animation.  The stories are getting better, the animation is going to the next level, and the characters are 1st class.

The First 10 minutes of the movie are amazing as far as animation goes.  Either the technology has really improved in recent months or finally Disney is getting the hang of Digital animation.

The story is unique and fun.  I loved the characters.  Bolt, mittens, and Rhino make a great team and left me laughing from start to finish.  The voices were perfect.  Miley Cyrus was the predictable easy choice given her current popularity, But she did well.  John Travolta was great!

The characters, especially Rhino the rodent with delusions of grandeur, work well. Animation, of course, meets very high standards. Somehow, though, Bolt adds up to a lot more than the sum of its parts.

To tell the truth, lots of those parts show wear: the good-buddy road trip, the loyal dog, and a stifling set of moral messages about being true to your friends. This could have turned into a snoozable sermon. Bolt's most amazing super-power might have been raising this movie well above its impoverished beginnings.

I think what did it was the pervasive sense of unreality. (If you haven't seen the trailers already, I won't give any spoilers.) Even when reality does set it, Bolt grits his teeth, dives in head first, and finds the adventure more exciting than ever - well, good realities are like that. It's a fun flick and a reminder to let a little magic into your life, even if you know darned well how all the tricks work.

3731425,5,B001OMU6UM,"My husband and I took our 4-year-old daughter to watch ""Bolt"" at the dollar movies today and we all loved it. My active preschooler actually sat still throughout the movie! This isn't classic Disney, but it is definitely in the vein of Disney family dramas - heartfelt entertainment for the whole family.

""Bolt"" [voiced by John Travolta] is a rescue puppy who grows up to believe he's a dog with super powers, having spent most of his life on a tv production set, battling the forces of evil with his human, Penny [Miley Cyrus]. When he's separated from Penny during a crucial scene where Penny is 'kidnapped' by the baddies, he is resolved to rescue her. Unfortunately, out in the real world, Bolt discovers to his dismay that he has 'lost' his superpowers, which he attributes to the styrofoam peanuts he was smothered in before being accidentally shipped off in a box to NYC. It is only after meeting a street smart kitty, Mittens [Susie Essman] that Bolt slowly comes to accept the realities of being a dog. Bolt uses his strength and cunning to force Mittens to show him the way to Penny [he is convinced that Mittens, being a cat, is in league with the baddies]. Along the way, the pair meet TV-addicted Rhino [Mark Walton], a pet hamster who immediately recognizes his 'hero' and finally the realization sinks into Bolt's consciousness that he is in fact, just an ordinary dog.

The trio go through many adventures on their journey back to LA [Bolt is adamant in getting back to Penny], and in the course of the film, Bolt as well as Mittens and Rhino discover the true value of friendship, of being true to one's self, perseverance and loyalty.

Most Disney productions do not fail to entertain whilst delivering inspiring messages, and Bolt succeeds on both counts. This is family friendly entertainment that is sure delight all ages [although it's definitely more for the kids].",1239494400,,1889,4.753048780487805

3731428,5,B001OMU6UM,"What can I say about this animated film except that, to my complete surprise, I fell in love with it and the cast of totally adorable characters. The film is about love, friendship, loyalty, and devotion, concepts that are sandwiched within this wonderful adventure story.

The main character, a dog named Bolt, is the star of a hit television show with his owner, Penny, a young girl who is always living on the edge of danger. Thanks to Bolt's super powers, however, she is kept safe. The only thing is that Bolt has no idea he really does not have super powers and that his beloved Penny is never really in any danger. His life is a carefully constructed lie made for prime time, thanks to the wizardry of special effects. In this respect, it is somewhat reminiscent of the film ""The Truman Show""

When Bolt escapes from his special studio lot trailer, thinking Penny is once again in danger, Bolt finds himself in the real world and gets a serious reality check, learning quite a bit about life and himself, while on the road to being reunited with  Penny. Along the way, he meets and is befriended by two wonderful characters, Mittens, a scrawny, cynical, tough-talking alley cat, and Rhino, the most adorable plump and juicy hamster the viewer could ever want to meet and a huge fan of Bolt. They join Bolt on his journey and have a number of hilarious adventures.

The film is both funny and heartwarming. The characters are fully fleshed, with distinct, recognizable personalities. The script is intelligent and well-thought out, and the animation is first-rate.  This is definitely entertainment that is enjoyable for the whole family.

John Travolta provides Bolt's voice and would win the honor of the worst miscasting if it were not for Miley Cyrus as Penny, Bolt's beloved owner and co-star of his superhero TV show.

Neither Travolta nor Cyrus improve this film. They provide names for the marketing department but neither of them breathes life into their animated character. Instead, it is Mark Walton who steaks every scene voicing Rhino, the ball-enclosed hamster who is Bolt's #1 fan.

Despite the poor casting and the tired story, the film quality is excellent. The colors are vibrant and the animation is of a much higher quality than what appeared on Space Chimps. There's even one must-see bonus feature - Super Rhino - that (smartly) features the movie's funniest character.

3731431,4,B001OMU6UM,"Despite having far superior product for distribution via Pixar, Disney still tries to churn out their own animation these days.  While the golden days of yesteryear are gone and the resurgence back in the early 90s are long behind us, it's nice to see disney put out a couple good titles here and there.

""Bolt"" is pretty good.  It's predictable, to be sure.  In fact, some of it reminds me of Disney's other recent dog film, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" in that a dog is removed from a somewhat priviliged background and forced to live like a regular dog.  Like any good animal movie, Bolt meets friends along the way.  Upstaging Bolt is Rhino, a hamster who worships Bolt and moves around in a little plastic ball.

What Disney has succeeded in doing is injecting a little heart back into their product.  It's something they've really not been able to successfully do since ""Lilo and Stitch.""  There's a really touching scene between Bolt and a stray cat named Mittens that not only captures the heart of the film, but really makes you think twice about animal abandonment!

Performances are good all around and the animation is top notch.  For some reason, I feel that Disney still wants to compete against their own partner Pixar.  Still, the characters aren't quite as multidimensional.  And considering the hero's plight to get back to his owner Penny, Penny really gets little time in this. The film has a fun road movie quality and the film makers seemed to have fun with the action sequences. It's a fun watch, but pretty far from Pixar quality.",1238371200,12,1552,4.724907063197026

3731433,5,B001OMU6UM,"It's no accident that Bolt is the first non-Pixar film to have that companys magic, or as one paper aptly said ""the first Disney offering in many years to have earned the sparkle of the fairly dust logo"". He's right.

The reason for that is almost certainly the involvement of John Lasseter, who was the driving force behind the Pixar classics we've come to know, and more importantly-trust with our kids. He's now apparently with Disney, and the difference is immediately obvious. Bolt is absolutely wonderful from beginning to end. It's funny, exciting, heartwarming and witty enough at the adult level to entertain mom and dad as well.

The last point is particularly important here. The Dreamworks method, and up till recently the Disney one for keeping adults in their seats has been the particularly lazy and offensive expedient of throwing-in enough sexual innuendo and fart gags to hopefully make mom and dad giggle. Assuming of course, that mom and dad have the class of Rosanne and the I.Q. of well....Rosanne.

Thankfully, Pixar has always decided to take the higher and decidedly more creative route of, oh, actually writing a script filled with wit, cleverness and sincere heart. Those three things will trump vulgarity to any thoughtful parent and child every time. And just when you fear that America is becoming the world's largest trailer park, the success of these wonderful Pixar films reminds you that Hollywood, and the audience they ostensibly serve, are not entirely bankrupt of heart and ideas.

Which happily brings us to Bolt. This really is the first film to come from a non-Pixar studio that is every bit as good as Finding Nemo, Cars, and Toy Story. The animation is jaw-dropping. The humor is sharp, the characters memorable, the action sequences exciting, and the lessons pure and simple; love, loyalty and courage. I can't imagine anyone not loving every moment of this film.

While it was sadly, slightly overshadowed by the (to my mind) smug and preachy Wall-E, for anyone more interested in entertaining their child than indoctrinating them, you couldn't do better than this. If you're an admirer of Pixar's films, I think you'll find that the spirt lives in Bolt far more than in the lesser film that got all the critical sighs. Please give this a try for your kids, and watch it with them.

3731436,3,B001OMU6UM,"From the ""We're Disney, we don't need Pixar everytime we do animation!"", comes a film that disproves that theory in the CGI filled 00's. Sure, at times it's looks like a Pixar film circa ""A Bug Life"", but that was over ten years ago. Sure, my 10 year old was entertained, but when a person that age isn't ""blown away"" with the first viewing you know you got a middle-of-the-road CGI flix. Bolt (an unrecognizable John Travolta) is a dog, similar to Lassie thru James Bond, that has his own TV show where he saves his young female owner (voiced by Miley Cyrus, who sounds like she needs to lay off the two-packs-a-day of Virginia Slims) from evil trying to destroy them. But Bolt doesn't know that he's just an actor and thru a typical plot point of getting sent hundreds of miles away from the one he loves to try to find a way back to her while learning the hard truths of who he really is along the way. Also lending a voice was surprisingly Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm who I kept expecting to say ""What's the f&*%$*' a matter with you Dog?"". Another thing I noticed is alot of gags seem to be borrowed from alot of other films and TV shows, most noticeably the New York pigeons that looked straight out of '90's Warner Bros Goodfeathers cartoon, which seemed more rip-off than homage. And of course you have the goof character Rhino The Hamster, rolling ball and all that helps with the lack of original lines & sight-gags along the way. Overall, this will pass the time with the younger generation but I doubt they'll be screaming for multiple viewings over WALL+E or even Kung Fu Panda. The one-disc version has the typical Disney ""look, we still have other retread stuff"" promos and a short film starring Rhino that you'll see coming a mile away, and way too short to boot (even for a short!). A decent rental, but like what the pigeons say, ""I've seen this dog somewhere before, but where?"" you'll be thinking the exact same thing.

When I went to see Bolt in theaters, I expected it to be a very badly made sell-out just so more toys could be made for kids to buy. I had to admit, the plot was pretty intriguing but I didn't expect much. In about 5 minutes after the movie started (I'm not kidding) I was intrigued. Bolt was an incredibly likable character as was Mittens.  The plot was hooking and though the story moved at the pace and technique of a normal Disney movie, the script and the interesting characters kept things unique and creative. I DO think the movie could have done without Rhino, the annoying-as-hell hamster, but it IS a kids movie and Rhino is full of kid-humor. Bolt convinced me to love it when I was sure I'd hate it.

I will say that there is a lot more action than I expected (which is good and bad I suppose) and I personally thought the movie was mildly disturbing in its themes. [see addition below] Nonetheless overall it's a fun movie that goes pretty fast, it's got a lot of humor that works, and all's well that ends well. Expect a LOT of action, a little bit of a downer with some of the story (redeemed in the end of course), and a fun and funny movie. I am giving it 4+ stars because I have seen better animated movies - the bar is pretty high - but I do recommend it.

Clarification on ""mildly disturbing"":
The story is about a dog who thinks he has a home, and a family consisting of the girl, and who thinks he is a super-dog. He then finds out that the girl is just an actor and that he was living in a fake reality - he is not a superdog either. So his entire concept of home, family, and his own identity are all completely ripped away. To me, that's at least mildly disturbing for children.",1236643200,,1059,3.9952830188679247

(Good use of a clicker, and you saw the difference between the trained dog, who related only to his trainer, and Bolt, who loved Penny and would never have been afraid of the fire.)  This is a movie full of love and laughter.  I can't wait to buy the DVD.  (Yes, there are unbelievable scenes, but I also enjoyed The Quantum of Solace and The Bourne movies.)",1236384000,5,859,4.267080745341615
3731442,4,B001OMU6UM,"BOLT, the latest Disney animated offering, is very cute and very fun.  A story about a little girl and her beloved dog, BOLT is a terrific film for the entire family.  My three year old daughter fell in love with the characters; she now wants a little white dog, named BOLT.  My husband and I both enjoyed the film; there are many places were we laughed out loud.

In BOLT, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and BOLT (voiced by John Travolta) are on their own, saving the world and each other from countless disasters.  Penny's father has been kidnapped by the arch-villian Dr. Calico (voiced by Malcolm McDowell).  But before he disappeared, Penny's father altered BOLT, and turned him into a canine superhero with laser vision, super speed, and the ultimate bark.  But what BOLT doesn't know is that his whole life is a TV series, and that truth has been carefully hidden from him.  He truly believes he has superpowers.  One day, however, after an episode where Dr. Calico captures Penny, BOLT accidentally gets loose in the real world.  He is shocked when his superpowers suddenly fail him, but becomes convinced that pink Styrofoam packing peanuts have the power to weaken him.  Eventually, however, he realizes the truth, and with the help of an alley cat named Mittens and a crazy hamster named Rhino, he discovers who he truly is, as he makes his way back home to Penny.  In the end, BOLT becomes a true hero, and saves the life of the one he loves the most.

As I stated above, BOLT is a very entertaining film, perfect for the entire family.  It is funny, adorable, and well cast.  Miley Cyrus is wonderful as Penny.  John Travolta is always a plus.  The rest of the cast is equally good, all working well together.  The animation is gorgeous, extremely realistic, and quite amazing.  Kids like it, and adults like it.

So why not five stars?  You would think that a Disney movie about a cute little girl and her adorable pup would be a slam dunk five stars.  Well, it is close, but it just isn't quite ""there.""  I wanted to see/hear more of Miley Cyrus, who does an outstanding job as Penny.  John Travolta, whom I love and who has created many memorable characters, needed MORE character as BOLT.  His voice was pleasant, and there was nothing wrong with his performance; it just didn't grab me the way his characters normally do.  Additionally, I think the writers let the audience down.  There is not a lot of ""pop"" in this script; perhaps it is just a bit bland.  The writers also lost sight of the target audience.  While BOLT is charming in most ways, too much of the comedy goes over kids' heads.  Adults may laugh out loud, but the kids are left puzzled.  While this happens in many kid films, it is usually more subtle and happens less frequently than it did here. The script simply tries to be too many things to too many people.

Don't get me wrong, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOLT, especially for an evening of family entertainment.  This film is very appealing and quite charming.  It just could have been a little bit more.",1235088000,,3042,4.551660516605166
3731443,5,B001OMU6UM,"I wasn't expecting Bolt to be this much fun. I kept laughing out loud. One touching part late in the film made me tear up. And the visuals are virtuoso.

The story has lots of familiar touches.

The truth is that he is on a television series, and has been living a lie most of his life (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show/dp/B0009UC7QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truman Show</a>, anyone?) His human, a preteen girl named Penny, is a child actress, although she truly loves Bolt and longs to give him a normal doggie life.

Although the plot could have been stronger, the visual effects and look of the film are amazing. I kept being distracted by the perfection on the screen. My poor daughter, who went with me to see the movie when it was released in theaters, had to endure me continually tapping her arm, saying ""Did you see that?! The smoke looks REAL!"" or ""The rust on the train looks PERFECT!""

A number of scenes use techniques I learned about watching a Pixar documentary on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B001EOQWEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>&nbsp;DVD. It's about the imperfect lens, or how cameras have inherent limitations. Animation of course doesn't use cameras in the traditional way. Yet in Bolt you see example after example of the filmmakers enhancing the reality of the movie by building in imperfections that don't have to be there. For instance, in one shot Bolt looks up at the sunny sky. The screen shows the squared-off circles you'd see if you pointed a camera's lens into the sun. The film also uses variable depth of field, much like a cameraman does when shooting a live-action movie. It's as if a camera is adjusting its lens as the scene progresses.

Bolt is voiced by John Travolta, and Penny by Miley ""Hannah Montana"" Cyrus. Both these likable actors delivered true-life, believable characters. They even sing together in the closing duet, ""I Thought I'd Lost You.""",1234310400,52,2444,6.054913294797688
3731444,2,B001OMU6UM,"I wanted to like this. I really did. But it offers nothing new. Nothing at all. And, i have to say, for the first hour the lead character is totally unsympathetic, with no redeeming warmth at all.

And the set-up, i feel, is completely blown by the first (very good) action scene. How would it be possible in any way at all to film that scene without the dog knowing it wasn't real? And i realise this is a cartoon, and that i shouldn't take everything quite so seriously but this is the premise for the entire film: that Bolt doesn't know he's on TV. Yet, if this were true, that scene is utterly unfilmable.

Sorry, but it's a big, big, big, big, big plot hole; one of many to be honest.

Anyway, our hero finds himself lost, alone and a long way from home. He enlists a couple of comedy sidekicks to help him get home, well, actually he kidnaps one (highly un-PC treatment towards the cat, btw), the other is a psychotic Scrappy-Doo. He travels across the country. Has a crisis of confidence when he realises he's not so super after all. Gets the toe curling pep speech common to at least 90% of Disney movies: ""The world needs a hero and YOU! are that hero!"" and sorts himself out. Then...

The worst of all, the 'You came back for me. Why did you come back for me?' bit about an hour into the film when Bolt goes back to rescue the cat he kidnapped. It's a horrible moment of cinema. Clichd does not even come close to the horror of suffering through that.

Suddenly everyone is friends and the journey home continues. But there's another crisis of confidence. Bolt's whole life has been a sham and maybe he is just not needed anymore. Pep talk... Confidence restored off Bolt goes and arrives just in time to rescue his owner from a perilous, death is certain, situation and become a real life hero... Ahh...

It says something about the movie when the best lines, best comedy and best scenes all come from the supporting cast. The pigeons are the Three Amigos, the rodent is a 'lemme-at-'em!' Scrappy-Doo with some cool post-modern hang-ups and the humans are too incredibly stupid to be taken as 'whole' believable characters. Bolt is just an unsympathetic Buzz Lightyear (imagine Toy Story if Buzz played it straight for three quarters of the film, but without any ensuing comedy.)

To be fair, i watched this twice, i really gave it a go, but the second time was with a distinct feeling of being cheated. Bolt is 'cut & paste' Disney by numbers and a perfect example of why the industry needs producers like Pixar. Bolt lacks the humour, the invention, the characterisation, the story, the depth, the irony, the quality and the FUN of a Pixar movie (tho, it does look fantastic). Ok, I'm being harsh on a cute cartoon but Bolt is still the wax apple next to Pixars healthy real thing.

Young kids raised on E-numbers and MRM will love it, it's all style over substance, Disney fans will love it cause they buy Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2. But it made me grimace more than it made me smile. And i didn't laugh once. It won't make any best of lists, that's for sure.

Very disappointed.",1233705600,18,3097,4.467256637168141
