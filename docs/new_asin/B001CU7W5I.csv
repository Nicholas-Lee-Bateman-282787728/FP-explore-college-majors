8289614,5,B001CU7W5I,"Most of us know so little about the Rape of Nanking and this is an excellent overview to introduce the subject. The Japanese have never officially apologized for the killing of 300,000 people and the ravishing of Chinese women and other atrocities too numerous to mention. For more information about the Rape of Nanking try researching American missionary, Minnie Vautrin, German businessman, John Rabe and read Iris Chang's book The Rape of Nanking.",1388016000,3,450,5.178082191780822
