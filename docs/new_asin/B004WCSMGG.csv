8620714,2,B004WCSMGG,"The title of this is a bit misleading. My nephew loves Curious George videos so I wanted to get him some in Spanish. Only one of the 10 stories is Curious George and the rest are other children's stories. It's also not animated...more like a narrated reading of each book/story. Perhaps I didn't read the fine print but if you're only looking for Curious George, don't order this.",1389571200,4,380,4.602941176470588
