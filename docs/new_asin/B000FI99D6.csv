The film is good, it begins in the present, and then it flashbacks a couple of times during the film. Giving us more deatails about the film. I personally think that the cast, and crew for this film were amazing; and they did an incredible story that we all can relate to! The reason I actually bought this film was, because one of my favorite actors was in this film. Trevor Wright, who plays Mitch the son of Sonny. And I was impressed, Wright always does a phenomenal job. Trevor, and every other actor and actress were all fantastic! I give this film a 10/10. Hopefully they keep making more films like this, hopefully you all enjoy this movie when you buy it; you won't regret it trust me!",1235433600,,817,4.27741935483871

The cast of characters was impressive and they brought the story to the audience with love and emotion.  Having lost a wife to breast cancer at the age of 45, I can certainly feel the pain and suffering of those going through the treatment.  What I especially liked about the movie was that it was not a tear jerker, but could have been.  It showed a side of compassion from a doctor trying to cure a patient with experimental treatment.  Unfortunately for the patient the cancer won in the end.  I would highly recommend this moveie for people who are suffering with cancer or who have lost a loved one to the disease.

All of the cast did a good job.

Jason Earles performance was great. Short but great none the less.",1153094400,5,311,4.081967213114754
8122785,5,B000FI99D6,"Finding a film with a solid plot is getting more and more  difficult, which makes ""Special Ed"" an oasis of sorts in a cinematic desert.  While the character development, cinematography, music, acting, and dialogue are all wonderful, this movie was made to tell a story to which almost anyone can relate.  The cast and crew use the other cinematic tools to enhance what they have to say, and it all comes together for an extremely enjoyable movie experience.",1148428800,8,457,4.833333333333333
8122786,5,B000FI99D6,I saw this movie the other day and was very impressed.  I found the movie to be well written and I was thorougly engrossed from the start.  The movie did a good job of transitioning from humor to drama and never seemed over-the-top of one or the other.  This was all the more amazing when you consider this is a first time writer/director.  I expect to see a lot out of him and would recommend you see the movie as it is entertaining.,1147046400,10,434,4.192771084337349
