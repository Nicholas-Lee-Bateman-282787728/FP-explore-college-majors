8600128,4,B00E1NR7J4,"This opera is filmed in Bussetto, the tiniest of opera houses, and near Verdi's farm at St'Agata. Il Corsarois is of one of Verdi's least known operas. You could say that this is an inspired performance of a less inspired opera. Based on a story of Lord Byron, and libretto by Piave, this should be a perfect ground for a Verdi-opera. There are some strong scenes in Act II, but as a whole, the plot does not convince. The leading quartet of singers are all excellent, especially Luca Salsi, who sings the role of Seid. There are some problems with the sound balance between the chorus and the orchestra, but otherwise the production should not disappoint anyone.",1411257600,,663,4.6752136752136755
