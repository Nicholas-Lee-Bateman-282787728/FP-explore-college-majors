Replaced with disbelief within the first 5 minutes of this bizarre propaganda and testimonial farce, i couldn't understand if Super Nova Slom, so called ""Hip Hop Medicine Man,"" was supposed to be a character in a comedic skit or something (entirely) else.  A reenactment of two thugs drinking 40s who suddenly switch to drinking ""40s"" of Chlorophyl? Bizarre...like a Chappelle skit but all too serious, real, and seemingly created by a religious sect in NYC.  I am going to hope that Common and Stic-man from Dead Prez agreed to be interviewed with no real understanding of the overall concept.  Raptavism Records has no such excuse.  I will be more wary of trusting their name in the future.  This gives everyone and everything involved with it a bad name.",1081036800,3,881,4.801324503311259
8346697,4,B000168A7I,I truly enjoyed the interviews but the skits threw me off. I didn't understand the relevance of them. I really enjoyed Erykah Badu...I wish I could have heard more from her. She has a lot of knowledge. I think that this is something that the Hip Hop generation needs to see.,1380326400,,274,4.392156862745098

I think that this is a must for all families  to have. It is very creative and entertaining as well as informative.  I especially loved the opinions given by men in the bonus footage. Super Nova is compassionate about health and was raised holistically. I repsect him very much for admitting that he had gotten off the nutritional path although he was raised vegan..this allows viewers of the video to see that no one is perfect, but one must try hard to do what's best for their body temple. Seeing artists such as Ben Vereen, Erykah Badu, Common, Dead Prez, Queen Afua and many others also gives the viewer a peek into the personalities of well-known people who live holistically. This is a very positive and motivating documentary.

I am a registered nurse and I see a lot of people suffer as a result of poor diets. There are also other factors that we have to deal with to be healthy such as social risk,enviromental risk,and genectic predispostions, so it is important that people adapt healthier lifestyles to lessen the chances of becoming ill and improve their quality of life. I think that diet is one thing that we do have control of.

I hope to see many more documentaries such as this that are more geared toward the youth.

8346700,5,B000168A7I,"In the video Supa Nova took the position of someone who wanted to learn from others and asked the questions that we wanted to know about sugar, non foods and drugs.  These substances are disguise in foods and are use by corporations to manipulate and control peoples moods and health.
I watched this video with my 4 yr old son who really ""got it"" about the use of sugar and candy. Thank you for representing  positive role-models for the youth to emulate!",1085097600,2,455,4.536585365853658
8346701,4,B000168A7I,"I am an educator, parent, and transitioning vegan.  I have long been interested in finding a way to improve my health in a way that was both substantial and practical.  This has not been a simple pursuit.  The dvd, Wholistic Wellness for the Hip-Hop Generation provided both an entertaining and informative perspective about adopting and maintaining a vegetarian lifestyle. Another aspect of this documentary that should not be ignored is the historical as it relates to culture.  Supa Nova Slom uses testimonials from various members of the African-American community to illustrate that there is a spiritual-nutritional connection to Afrikan wellness. Most people do not know that everything in the American society has been specifically designed to maintain the stautus quo regarding  class and racial lines.  There is an absolute connection between diet, spirituality and progress.  This has been lost on the hip-hop generation because of the impurities in their bodies coming from food supplied by their country of origin,starting from birth.  The children are feed Similac and Enfamil, and are immediately on the path of separation from their natural selves and community.  People of other persuasions may not understand this, however, as a woman of African ancestry, I experience the results of this separation on a daily basis.  The comedic usage of the ""brothers"" promoting ""Green Life"" rather than ""Street Life"" demonstrates the dedication of Supa Nova Slom and his associates to helping to heal the community through the usage of love and gentle reprimand rather than condemnation.  It should also be understood that the artists on the documentary are extremely dedicated to the salvation of Black people, particulary the poor and underserved.  This being the case, I am absolutely certain that they were aware that the testimonials they gave would be widely distributed throughout the Hip-Hop and global communities.  Praise and Power to Wholistic Wellness for the Hip-Hop Generation and its creators.  The youth desparately need this message and to hear it from someone who speaks their language.",1085011200,8,2108,5.367781155015198
8346702,5,B000168A7I,"I was filled with joy after watch the wholistic wellness video. Supa Nova Slom made an approach that no other have ever did.  He took wholistic wellness to the streets where it is needed, cause our youths are the future of today and our people are dying from health problems. He approached it in a way that the children of the streets and even gangsters would understand and be able to relate to. Like when he had the Thugs drinking 40's and fliped to drinking a chlorophyll drink was off da hook, for our brothers in streets need to stop drinking liquor that kills there sperm & internal organs and drink what will bring life to them. All I got to say is that the Brother did his thing and we need more people like him on this planet.",1084924800,2,735,4.287769784172662
8346703,5,B000168A7I,"I must say, after viewing Holistic Wellness I was both inspired and fullfilled by the entire concept. In a society where harmful and subsequently malignant substances (Alchohol, fried-foods, smoking,leading causes of cancerous death in the African American community particularly)are incessantly promoted through mediums such as Hip-Hop, one of the world's most influential cultures today, this documentary is well overdue. With plausible testimonials by Dr. Laila Afrika author of African wholistic Health and various reknown musical recording artist such as Erikah Badu, Dead Prez and Common Sense, all whom live wholistic life styles I know this will inspire many others youth and adults to be more conscious of what they put into their bodies, their temple. I commend the young host Supa Nova for this ""diamond in the rough"" within a predominantly destructive Hip-hop generation.",1084924800,4,883,5.597014925373134
8346704,5,B000168A7I,"When I first sat down to view this wholisitic wellness video for the hiphop generation, I didn't expect to see what I saw.
Firstly I learned so much from the profound speaker Laila O'Afrika, secondly I better understood the position of certain artists that are in the Industry and who this Supa Nova was.
This film helped remind me of the dangers we put our body in and the appeal to the generation of hiphoppers who aren't aware that all hiphop isn't focused on drugs and being a thug was refreshing.
This is a video that my son can watch and he is only 6.
This video is about the cleansing of our minds, bodies and spirit and its orchestrated in such a way to where ANYBODY can realize the importance of better health.
Who in the WORLD is Supa Nova and why I haven't heard of him before is unbeknowance to me however, Thank you Supa Nova and the other artists, actors and what have you, for focusing in on something this society tends to overlook and abuse.
I am patiently awaiting the next thing this interesting person puts out.",1084924800,2,1032,4.408376963350785
8346705,5,B000168A7I,"Greeting vegans and future vegans.  Media of this type is long over due and indeed a TRUE blessing.  With the Hip Hop Generation having a very strong influence on everything else from killing, drugs, and sex, I find it very refreshing that a visionary such as Supa Nova would do the honors of gracing the media with his wisdom and knowledge on holistic living.  And what better audiences than the youth.  There are so many toxic babies producing more toxic babies, its time that that generational cures is put to a forever STOP.  I believe this DVD is a major step forward in that direction.  I feel anyone who does not see this as a step of positivity, is truly constipated and frustrated.  My advise to those haters... get an enema bag and drink water with chlorophyll instead of hater-ade.  As I am a vegan and healer, I will surely use this product in my teachings/healings and continue to spead the excellent work of the anointed Supa Nova aka ""The Medicine Man.""",1084924800,2,968,4.587209302325581
8346706,5,B000168A7I,"I thought that the documentary had a very urban approach.
Using a practicing holistic wellness consultant that also
is an MC gives the documentary a sincer feel. Super Nova
 Speaks from the heart, which is hard to find in this error of hip-hop.
Everyone that was interviewed had something profound to
say about holistic wellness and how it can affect the community.
Overall I think that this film will be scrutinized because of the
Subject mater and because it is the first of its kind...
It's a great learning tool and my children love to watch it.",1084924800,4,549,4.65979381443299
