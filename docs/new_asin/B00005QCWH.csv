7950190,2,B00005QCWH,"I loved this show as a kid and bought this for my daughters. I was hoping this DVD was a home movie, but it is simply a collection of the season three episodes Labyrinth I-III. No point in buying this DVD when the whole series is only $8 on DVD, or free on YouTube.",1502496000,,265,3.925925925925926
7950191,4,B00005QCWH,I enjoyed these episodes of CS.  I really liked the type of information that the kids learned from this one.  My kids love this and all CS dvd's.  There hasn't been one CS dvd yet that my kids haven't watched a hundred times.  I recommend this one to any CS fan.,1244160000,,262,4.078431372549019
7950192,5,B00005QCWH,"These three time-traveling episodes are the best ""continuation-episodes"" in the whole series.

The first has Carmen begin her crime & plan, which introduces us and isn't the best... although giving us a taste of her training grounds.

Secondly, (the best episode) Carmen becomes a ""hero"" again and it shows us the future of New York City.

Thirdly, Carmen ventures into the past and this is another well-done episode showing the style of Carmen and how good she can truly be with her crimes.

The three DVD's prepare all of us... or give us hope that they release the rest of the series on DVD.",1135555200,,594,4.6826923076923075
