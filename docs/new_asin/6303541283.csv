Patty Duke plays a woman that has an alcohol problem and her marriage is on the verge of divorce. She is trying to stop the drinking but one evening after work she sees a bar and she can't resist and has to have a few drinks before heading home. It is pouring down rain outside . As she starts to leave she witnesses a woman in the alley by the bar get murdered. The killer notices that she saw him and he starts towards her car. She locks the doors quickly as he presses his face against the window and beats on her window and car in anger. She takes off really quickly and goes home to tell her husband what happened. Her and her husband fight because she wants to call the police and he doesn't want her to get involved. She ends up calling the police and her husband leaves her. During the course of the rest of the movie, it is packed full of thrills as the killer comes after her, terrorizing her. He breaks into her home several times in an attempt to kill the only witness to the murder. A policeman gets involved in the situation and through the movie the killer manages to get away several times but before he does get away he comes closer and closer to getting Patty Dukes character. I will stop right here because I do not want to give any of the ending away. If you have not seen this movie, in my opinion it is one of Patty Duke's best parts played. I saw yesterday where she passed away. She was a great actress and a classy lady that will truly be missed. Rest in peace Patty Duke.",1459296000,3,1654,4.1080246913580245

A wonderful story of a woman who keeps it together when her life was falling apart in every direction. One of the  greatest answers in life for us all, is dwelt with as the story concludes.",1332288000,4,360,4.358208955223881
