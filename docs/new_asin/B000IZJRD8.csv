8148158,3,B000IZJRD8,"So, in my search for all things Kajol, I stumbled across KUCH KHATTI KUCH MEETHI. This Bollywood film came out in 2001, and is actually the second time in which Kajol has played twins. Except that, unlike in the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dushman/dp/B000IZJR10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dushman</a>, these twins have a happier ending.

The plot tells of Sweety and Tina, 22-year-old twin sisters, who had been separated at birth and who had no idea that the other existed. Sweety was raised in India under her father's constant state of inebriation, and, understandibly, she's grown bitter and hardened. Now an amateur jockey, Sweety at all doesn't mind throwing a race or two for the right amount of money. She detests her father. Meanwhile, in London, England, Tina has become a sweet and sunny soul, and well-cherished by her mother. Tina helps her mom run her supermarket store. Thru a chain of unlikely circumstances, Sweety and Tina manage to find each other. They then concoct a plan in which they switch places (although, by this time, Sweety had already taken Tina's place) and then attempt to reconcile their fractured family.

Familiar? Yup, this is a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parent-Trap-Vault-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parent Trap (Vault Disney Collection)</a>, but with a Bollywood twist or two. For one thing, there's a wicked step-aunt here who unendingly schemes to keep the family split up so that she can end up with the family fortune. It was she who lied to the parents, telling each separately that one twin did not survive the birthing process. There's a modest love interest thrown in, in the person of Sunil Shetty, who plays a young Indian dude stranded in England (a gambling debt having deprived him of his passport). And, yes, the twins' father is a drunk. And, sometimes, he's a mean drunk.

After having seen the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kuch-Kuch-Hota-Hai-Shahrukh-Khan/dp/B000QYGHCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (Shahrukh Khan)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-Dulhania-Le-Jayenge-2DISC-SET/dp/B000Z9PWKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (2DISC SET)</a>&nbsp;and the very good&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhie-Gham/dp/B000Z9B7XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</a>&nbsp;(all starring Kajol), I hesitate to criticize any of Kajol's films, but I have to say that KUCH KHATTI KUCH MEETHI is a letdown. This film is riddled with flaws and things to not like, from the klunky story to the forced humor to the weak songs and all the way to the messed up resolution. The last straw for me is when Sweety pulls a tank out of nowhere and annihilates the car of the three supermarket thugs. That was just way too out of left field. As for the comedy, the film relies on stupid Viagra payoffs, various food stuffs dumped on the noggins of bad relatives, and that old tried-and-true mirror gag (for the twins). This last one's been around for so long, even the Marx Brothers have made use of it.

Plot SPOILERS in this next paragraph.

What ticks me off is that the film cheated the audience out of several must-see moments. That scene in which Sweety and Tina first meet each other, knowing that they're sisters and twins? A big moment, right? Possibly, the most important one in KUCH KHATTI KUCH MEETHI? But the film chooses to gloss over this key moment. Then there's the mother learning thru a telephone call that her other daughter is alive. What? How is that more dramatic than, say, the mother seeing her twins standing next to each other? But the most messed up thing for me is the way the film ends. It involves the mother about to walk out on her husband again, only to have him slap the bejeesus out of her (he does the same to Tina earlier in the film). He then tells her that he won't let her leave. And, apparently, that was what his wife had been waiting for, for him to exercise this ""marital right."" They embrace, and the film closes with the daughters, Tina and Sweety, applauding their parents. Me, I was shaking my head.

Okay, end SPOILERS.

The acting isn't bad; it just can't elevate the film above its quicksand elements. Rishi Kapoor plays the despondent, alcoholic father, and he has his moments. I'm not a fan of Sunil Shetty, but he's pretty amusing here. Sadly, he doesn't have chemistry with Kajol, which is surprising because Kajol can usually muster a connection with even a dead donkey. The most salvageable thing about KUCH KHATTI KUCH MEETHI is Kajol's performance. Or, rather, performances. As laborious as this movie is, she still makes chunks of it work, simply because she's that good. You can't help but like these sisters. She makes a believer of the audience in that there are actually two people on the screen, instead of one, and this, despite some shoddy special effects. Admittedly, of the two roles, the beer-swigging, mean-tempered, won't-take-any-guff Sweety is the more charismatic and interesting. Tina is your typical sweet girl, nice but bland. The film really should've given Sweety the romantic arc. The love story certainly could've used some simmer. Also, the film would've benefited by more scenes of Tina and Sweety interacting. Yes, I'm saying that, even though she already plays two roles here, there still isn't enough Kajol on screen.

So, three stars for KUCH KHATTI KUCH MEETHI, with most of these stars based solely on Kajol's presence. This isn't her best film, and by no means is this her best performance. But it's still a good performance. And it's still Kajol, the best actress in Bollywood cinema. I bow down to her.",1207872000,5,5911,5.487912087912088
8148159,4,B000IZJRD8,"Kajol is my all time favorite actress (hard feat for a 52 year old WM).  When she cries, I cry.  When she laughs, I laugh.  She makes me feel like I am the hero opposite her in the film.

It is a good Indian story of identical twins that find each other in their late teens or early 20's and have different but complimentary personalities but different than Walt Disney's Parent Trap.",1188604800,,384,4.291666666666667
