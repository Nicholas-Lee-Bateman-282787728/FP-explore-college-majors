Good scenes include pretending to kill Snow White with the commercial of ""Burger Queen"" (""You want it your way, there's the doorway. You'll have it our way, or not at all at Burger Queen""), Snow White's attempts at cooking (""Back, you bread, back! You still have an hour to bake! And no backtalk.""), and the ""Three Bears"" parody (""Too short. Ow! Too soft. Oh, too splashy, ah! Perfect.""). Plus, a reference to the horror film ""Psycho"" (""Norman! Who are you talking to? No one, Mother! But she's very pretty!"") is very funny, even down to the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates lookalike.
I advise you to buy it, if only for the mirror.",1315180800,,848,4.549019607843137

The dialogue is sprinkled with comments that will keep adults entertained over repeated viewings.  It's not too long as well so the kids make it through the entire movie some times.

It's suitable for small children.  Nothing really scary is in it.  The witch is more of an ugly old lady than a scary witch.

Many of the characters are imitations of famous personalities and characters from other movies and shows.  I'm surprised this version isn't better known.  I first found out about it on YouTube, but those clips seem to have been taken off.",1247702400,,648,4.508620689655173

as Disney's version, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have
charms
of its own: After all, why would I give it five stars?
This is the basic story of Snow White, the princess who flees away from her jealous stepmother. It is very funny, with several fairy tale wise cracks and jokes. In short, this is a worthy film, worth the money...",1019174400,,388,4.1866666666666665
