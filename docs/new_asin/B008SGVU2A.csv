5181782,5,B008SGVU2A,"Loved it!  I adore the classic adventure films of the 50' and 60's like Mogambo (Clark Gable), White Witch Doctor (Robert Mitchum), Hatari (John Wayne) and Rampage (Robert Mitchum) and this film did not disappoint!  Safari is one to watch and relish when adventure, romance and fabulous scenery were combined.  If you enjoy adventure jungle films with beautiful Cinescope and Technicolor, you'll surely enjoy this Victor Mature film as well.  Ah, they sure don't make films with great men like this anymore.",1350000000,16,507,5.146341463414634
5181783,3,B008SGVU2A,"Sony are slowly releasing all the big-budget Warwick action films.
This latest entry starring Victor Mature who did more Warwicks than
anyone else (about 6)is very non PC by todays standards.
Firstly a magnificient elephant is shot at the start of the film;this
does NOT look faked;it looks as if it was done for real.
Secondly the Africans are all portrayed as ""Yes Bwana"" lackeys or vicious
killers.
Very much of its era but if you can overlook this what we have is an action
packed jungle adventure. The film looks great and the high definition transfer
from Sony is top drawer as always.
Janet Leigh is fatally mis-cast but brawny Mature is in his element.
Far less offensive and a better film IMHO is Warwicks other 1956 jungle
epic ODONGO also out on DVD from Sony.
Hopefully other Warwick films will follow like THE BLACK KNIGHT,A PRIZE
OF GOLD,TANK FORCE,HIGH FLIGHT and ADAMSON OF AFRICA.",1348272000,4,897,4.756410256410256
5181784,4,B008SGVU2A,"In the early fifties, Producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli formed Warwick Films, a British company which specialized in Action programmers utilizing American actors such as Alan Ladd (THE BLACK KNIGHT-1954).  Joining their party was Victor Mature and the first of his forays for them was an enjoyable combination of jungle thrills and revenge, Director Terence Young's 'SAFARI'- 1956 which was a staple of Sixties television.  Now for the first time, this rarity is presented by Sony/Columbia in a DVD-R preserving the CinemaScope image and shows a genre which went the way of the Western as passe and extinct.  In our modern age, who needs films on safari expeditions of big game hunting?  This film, however, also adds confrontations with killer Mau Mau tribes as Mature relentlessly pursues them to take revenge on their slaughter of his family and also getting mixed up with a millionaire big game hunter who brings along his fiance played by Janet Leigh and complicates matters by introducing a love triangle.  Mature looks great in the role and the film did modest box office convincing the producers to make more actioners with him including 'ZARAK' the same year also released as a DVD-R and 'THE BANDIT OF ZHOBE'-1959 which may see a digital release this year.  Allen would go onto produce other great programmers such as Director Jack Cardiff's 'THE LONG SHIPS'-1964 and Director Henry Levin's 'GENGHIS KHAN'-1965 plus the Dean Martin/Matt Helm series.  Broccoli would hit paydirt by teaming with Harry Saltzman and getting their hands on Ian Fleming's James Bond novels producing Director Terence Young's 'DR.NO'-1963 and the rest is history on that genre.  Its great escapist fare showing material no longer marketable at this time but still gives the viewer a touch of nostalgia for those simpler times.  Victor Mature fans may revel for these past months have seen many of his films being released and may introduce new fans to this underrated actor.",1346716800,12,1973,5.08359133126935
5181785,5,B008SGVU2A,"I always liked Victor Mature and Janet Leigh. This film was directed by Terrance Young of the Sean Connery,James Bond  films. It is a grand adventure and you get to see Janet's fine bust line in a bathing shot. Very naughty for 1957. But this was a British film with 2 American stars. The Black cast were good as well. Worth buying.",1418601600,,332,4.354838709677419

5181793,4,B008SGVU2A,Safari starring Janet Leigh and victor Mature is not up to Mogambo action and style but it is interesting take on the Mau mau uprising.,1369612800,2,135,4.44
5181794,5,B008SGVU2A,"""Safari"" was made in 1956 and is superior entertainment made at a time
when the story  was the most important part of every good movie and
the action was believeable.

If there was such a thing as a 6 star rating, I would give this movie a 6 star
rating because it is a story about real life experiences and does not contain
grossly exaggerated action scenes.  It was made by people with considerable
talent and vision - Albert R. Brocolli was co-producer (he went on to produce
the highly successful James Bond movies, along with Harry Saltzman) and
Terence Young was director (he directed a number of the early James Bond
movies).  Brocolli was also a partner in forming Warwick Productions to make
films in England.  ""Safari"" is a Warwick Production.

The story which was photographed on location and is based on fact, deals
with the Mau Mau uprising which was a military conflict that took place in Kenya
between 1952 and 1960.  It involved a Kikuyu dominated anti-colonial group
called Mau Mau and they fought elements of the British Army, auxiliaries and
anti-Mau Mau Kikuyu for independence.

Their method to get rid of the white settlers was by violence, both harsh and
cruel.  Because they had few guns, their favourite weapon appeared to be the
machete which was used to strike down their victims without mercy.  The main
problem was that the settlers could not tell their friends from their enemies
and quite often their enemy was one of their most trusted native helpers.  In
the circumstances you could not become complacent, so you trusted no one.
You had to be vigilant at all times - not a satisfactory environment in which to
live.

The story concentrates on Ken Duffield (Victor Mature) who was a white settler
living in Kenya at the time on a somewhat isolated property in the country.  He
lived there with his trusted native helpers and his young son who he adored and
they both loved each other.  At that time the influence of the Mau Mau was not
established in that area but was spreading at a rapid rate and soon their property
became threatened.

Duffield was notified of the approaching danger whilst out on patrol and hurried
back to his homestead but arrived too late only to find the homestead torched and
destroyed with the trusted native helpers dead.  Amongst the dead was his young
son who fought courageously to defend his home and was shot down at close
quarters by three bullets from a supposedly loyal helper.

Duffield's main thought was for revenge which in the circumstances was justified
and he was prepared to do anything to get the person responsible.  As expected,
the local authorities tried to restrain Duffield from taking matters into his own hands
but this did not stop him.  To circumvent the authorities, Duffield signed on to lead
a hunting safari into the interior.  The only problem was the leader of the safari,
whose main intention was to capture an elusive lion that no one had been able to
track and he was prepared to do anything to personally capture it, including killing
anyone who got in his way.

Eventually, the safari was ambushed by the Mau Mau terrorists and the opportunity
arose for Duffield to get his revenge because the leader of the terrorists who lead
the attack on his homestead and killed his son was present.

The cinephotography and the native style musical score were both impressive and it
should be pointed out that the picture ratio on the disc is in its original widescreen
format of 2.55 to 1 and not in the ratio of 1.33 to 1 as stated in Amazon's technical
description.

""Safari"" is entertainment at its very best.",1369353600,11,3600,4.706539074960127
