1818799,5,B00007L4M0,"So here I am sitting in a desert, living the spartan life, away from family and loved ones.  What better way to temporarily forget about the barren life your living, than to see some buxom babes and great corny humor.
A friend threw this in his laptop as we gathered around to watch a movie after a long day.  We laughed our asses off.
Surprisingly good humor.  Not to the league of ""Robin Hood : Men in Tights"", but it was close for being a B movie.  There were more than plenty of crazy side jokes.  One of the most memorable characters (besides Misty, Darian, Ruby, etc) was Smirnoff - the drunken old mage.
Although the plot was a satyr on LOTR, it flowed amazingly well.  Everything was developed quite nicely.
The only stuff missing was a cold beer in my hand, and a bowl of popcorn in the other.  Well worth buying.",1064102400,26,822,4.333333333333333

Perhaps if your sitting home alone then this movie isn't for you but if you are looking for some fun to start a night of more fun then I think this movie is a great start.
It is full of puns, bad jokes and VERY tame sexual situations.  My husband says it's almost tame enough to be party porn, I'm not sure I would say that.  However if you are a fan of LOTR then this movie will get you laughing and get things going.",1063843200,83,552,4.083333333333333

1818902,4,B00007L4M0,"First, I feel I should sum up my background, before giving my opinion. I'm 24, female, a virgin, and have seen very little of pornographic films.  ""Lord of the G-Strings"" is the first I've watched the full way through. I am familiar with the human body though, since I'm an (armature) artist, and minored in Studio Art. I consider myself a feminist, and am heterosexual.  And I have an extremely childish sense of humor. I cannot comment on how well-done the sex scenes are, since (1) I'm not attracted to women, (2) I don't know the subject matter, and can't compare them to other pornos, and (3) I watched an edited version of LOTG-Strings, in which the actual intercourse scenes were removed.  That being said, I greatly enjoyed ""Lord of the G-Strings,"" from a comedic and artistic standpoint.

STORY:

The story is quite clever. It follows ""Lord of the Rings"" closely enough to count as a parody, but keeps a safe distance from Tolkien's storyline. This way, LOTGS is able to keep the story simple, easy to follow, and throw in its own plot twists and spoofs of other movies. The Cowardly Lion from ""Wizard of Oz"" appears, in an almost word-for-word re-do of his introductory scene in the original movie. Another scene spoofs--I think--""Deliverance"" (is that the movie where a man is assaulted by hillbillies?). The plot twist of the G-String replacing the ring of power is hilarious, to anyone who loves low-brow humor.

My only complaint here is that the middle of the movie drags on in many parts, which are neither relevant to the story nor funny. To be fair though, these scenes were probably set-ups to some long, more ""relevant"" sex scenes that my DVD (thankfully) didn't show me.

COMEDY:

As mentioned above, the middle of the film has slow parts. But the beginning and ending are hilarious, and even some of the slower moments in the middle made me laugh. The opening Prologue scene made me burst out with laughter, as a hoard of warriors charged into a forest expecting a battle, and instead found a pair of gorgeous lesbians making out randomly in the forest. Most of the sexual content followed this pattern. Though it was obvious that every other scene would involve sex, the movie always found a way to throw that sex at your face in the way you least expected it to show up. Maybe it would be more predictable to someone who's watched a lot of porn, but to me, it was one funny ""WTF?!"" scene after another.

Aside from the sex, there are plenty of other toilet jokes. The villain Sourass provides the obligatory fart-jokes. A few of his scenes are more gross than funny, but at least the movie didn't show us anything nasty there. His magical and lethal farts make for some hilarious battle scenes, and he gives some of the funniest lines in the movie, like, ""He's the only one ever to escape the full wrath of my ass!""

There's a playful, cartoony element many scenes. I found at least two Monty Python references, and the more dramatic moments are often helped along by cartoonish sound-effects.

What really makes this movie though is...

THE CAST:

Some of the supporting lack enthusiasm, but the most important characters deliver beautifully.  The acting is corny, but in a fun, deliberate way. Misty Mundae brings a calm, calculating mischievousness to the role of Dildo Saggins. Michael R. Thomas meanwhile steals the show as Smirnoff the Wizard, replacing Gandalf's slow and dramatic calm for a hiccupping, cross-eyed, drunk. Thomas's ridiculous expressions and Sean Connery impression make his character the best, by far.  John Pual Felede is almost equally enthusiastic as the evil Sourass,  delivering his profanity-filled speeches in a sort of combination between an operatic super-villain and a cranky New Yorker. John Link is hilarious as the Creature Bollum, if for nothing else, the nasally ""nerd"" voice he uses; but sadly, his character is grossly underused. A.J. Kahn and Darian Caine are good as Spam and Horny (A.J. does great things with her eyes, and Caine has a cute voice). Several supporting characters sport Irish or Scottish accents--for some reason--and somehow, that adds to the fun. Lastly, there's Barbara Joyce as Queen Araporn. Joyce is beautiful, and a surprisingly good actress for a porno. She gives a regal and motherly (if slutty) performance, and wound up being one of my favorite characters.

FEMINIST CRITIQUE:

First, I was surprised by how natural these girls' beauty was. Boobs of all sizes and variations are shown, and they all look real. Likewise, the girls' faces look surprisingly ""real"" and distinctive--not at all like the ""perfect,"" plastic-surgery faces we see in so many Hollywood films, and on Play Boy posters. (My first college roommate was obsessed with ""Girls Next Door""--don't ask.)  Even the bodies were diverse and often ""imperfect."" One of the most beautiful (and whore-ish) characters, a stark naked elf...or nymph...or something...was noticeably ""pudgy"", and lovely in her own way.

The actresses seemed to be having as much fun with this movie as their male comrades. I did not get the feeling of prostitutes, being forced to perform before a camera, in order to pay the bills. Instead, ""Lord of the G-Strings"" has the feel of a group of friends having an extremely goofy time, who aren't ashamed to throw off their clothes and get ""dirty.""

ART:

The girls' natural beauty , and the one handsome male in the movie, were not the only good visuals. One other thing I love about this movie is the costumes.  I agree with the Gay Knight: I want to know where they got those outfits! (Not that I'd ever wear them on the street, but they'd be great to incorporate into a sci-fi costume or something...) The warrior characters wear very kinky outfits, with medieval decorum.  The elf women meanwhile get some pretty medieval dresses. The rest of the cast--the wizards, the Cowardly Lion, the hillbillies, the Dorks (Orcs)--clearly got their costumes from home, thrift shops, or the Halloween store.  It's amusing to see familiar costume pieces, like Mickey Mouse's wizard hat on Sourass's lackey.  The props are good too; the girls's swords have very cool handles, some shaped like dragons, and Smirnoff's skull-staff is a nice touch.

Then there's the surreal, and oddly calming feel to the whole movie. It's filmed outdoors, in some kind of a park or nature preserve, very cheaply.  The trees, sunshine and birds chirping are real, not effects.  Something about that just makes you feel like you're ""there,"" and gives ""Lord of the G-Strings"" a good escapism quality.

OVERALL:

This movie is entertaining, and very oddly relaxing. After a long, bad day at work, I would gladly turn to this film for an escape from reality and maturity.",1365552000,4,6717,4.881266490765172
1818903,5,B00007L4M0,The shipment of this movie was lightning fast and packaged very well. The movie itself is just as expected with it being a low budget B-movie and Softcore porn..and it is AWESOME! I got it for my boyfriend as part of an anniversary gift because he's big into Lord of the Rings and I thought he would get a kick out of this. We have both thoroughly enjoyed this movie and are very happy =D,1357516800,,388,4.1866666666666665
1818904,5,B00007L4M0,"This movie is absolutely and mindlessly funny! Production values are higher than one would expect. And the puns are non-stop! The three main actresses play their parts to the utmost comedic effect. If I liked the ""Trilogy"" I would still like this movie. Since I don't enjoy the Peter Jackson series, this DVD, with all of its' nudity, innuendo, and tongue-in-cheek dialogue, provides tremendous enjoyment. Some may call it porn, but the nudity I feel draws unsuspecting people in and charms them with the playful interaction between the characters.",1283385600,,548,5.168539325842697
1818905,3,B00007L4M0,"I always wonder why so meny people complain about the acting and cheap production of these films. Maybe they don't know what Seduction Cinema is about. Well, some of us know and realize that there's only one reason to buy their films. I have around 10 of their films and have never seen any in their entirety (with the exception of the excellent Erotic Vampire in Paris), just use the skip button to go the ""good stuff"".

That said, this film was a dissapointment for me. Despite having one of the finest casts in a SC film, the lesbian action is nowhere near as hot as Vampire Vixens or Play-Mate Of The Apes. This film severely lacks action below the waist (even AJ Kahn wasn't her usual energetic self on this one) and I personally, don't like to see male hands touching our beloved Misty Mundae, here she has a sex scene with a guy.

I recommend getting this DVD if you enjoy the usual Seduction Cinema humor but be warned of the limited sex content.",1232064000,,954,4.4147727272727275

Good packaging, though! I am sure it sales. Don't bother - just throw your money in the garbage - same effect.",1137196800,7,278,4.6938775510204085
1818908,2,B00007L4M0,"This film is mildly enjoyable as a spoof of Lord of the Rings, but as an erotic film it's incredibly tame. I was surprised how little nudity is in it since it's played up as being such a sexy film. Since that's got to be the reason a lot of people watch it, why in the world did the producers not have some of the sexy babes who are in it romp around topless or totally in the buff through most of the film??? If you buy it to see such titillation, you'll find yourself mostly waiting for a few brief flashes every now and then. I think the overall low production values, such as the poor acting, also work against it being much erotic. So if you're getting this to watch in a mixed group or as a LOTR spoof it's OK, but forget about getting it for any kind of erotic turn-on.",1120953600,15,776,4.045454545454546
1818909,4,B00007L4M0,"Obviously, ""Lord of the G-Strings"" is an enjoyable spoof on ""Lord of The Rings"", and a pretty well-done one at that, considering the usual in this genre. The actresses are gorgeous, the film is essentially surrounded in beauty, though the dialogue is predictably weak, as is the acting, but it is all in good fun, after all. ""Schmirnoff"" The Wizard is a likable goofball, the Orcs here called ""Dorcs"" are a bumbling lot, ""Dildo Saggins"" takes the place of Bilbo Boggins as an enchanting girl who possesses the omnipotent G-String which must be destroyed lest it be captured by ""Sourasse"", who's primary weaponry consists of his deadly sulphurus emanations, battles Schmirnoff in the end. Accompanying Dildo throughout ""Diddle Earth"" are two lovely ""Throbbit"" companions who routinely pleasure each other in a lesbian lust-fest at every opportunity, although the most remarkable scenes have to be the orgy beside the camp-fire {which lasts a generous amount of time, accompanied with Middle-Eastern music which was a really great touch}, and in the pub with a very randy waitress redhead. The resident Dryad seems to be misplaced, and the two faeries are annoying until they join in the fun.

Towards the conclusion of the film, it unfortunately takes a steep direction with the inclusion of a cell-phone and a really lazy effort at the celebration by all present. The main thrust of this presentation is Lesbianism, with only one man/woman scene, although it is very entertaining nonetheless.

1818911,2,B00007L4M0,"This movie, if you can call it that, has to be the laziest movie ever filmed. It doesn't try to be serious at any point. It jsut tries to be funny and stupid. It isn't erotic, it isn't that funny (well actually it is hilarious, but you are laughing at the movie).

The movie was filmed in some park in New Jersey. It is about 3 Throbbits who are horny bisexual beings who meet up with Smirnoff, the wizard who entrusts them with a quest to destroy the evil g-string. It doesn't seem so bad when you just talk about it, but seeing how horribly lazy this film is, the satire ends there.

Comparing this to sexploitation satires of the warly 70s this is weak and amateurish. The actors make no attempt to stay in character or to actually, dear lord, act. It is just pathetic and sadly enough it is not at all erotic. The girls are not really that attractive, and do not get it on nearly enough to make this movie a full fledged porno.

Thus, the movie is stuck in a rut. It has neither enough story nor erotica. It is hilarious, but only hilarious in the way that a retard drinking water from a hose is hilarious and frankly the retard is more interesting.",1102982400,5,1153,4.255707762557078

That's fine for the most part but its cut too obviously, the camera just barely trims off what you shouldn't see, so you get a mildly let down feeling at the end.  Non-the-less, for soft core its very funny and you do get to see quite a bit more of the characters, if not as much as you'd like.  :D",1073347200,4,471,3.978723404255319
