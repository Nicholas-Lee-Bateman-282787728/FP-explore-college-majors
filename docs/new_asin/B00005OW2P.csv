Created more than 25 years ago, this foreign masterpiece is steamy, sexy...beautifully edited and should become a period classic.  Yes...it is billed as a horror film...but it is an adult experience in erotica, beastiality, and compassion.  I really don't want to give the plot away...even though it is simple and explicit.

Buy this DVD for your ""ADULT"" collection and keep it away from the kids.  I believe AMAZON should restrict its sale to adults only.  Need I write more???  Buy it...turn down the lights...enjoy.

THE FILM - [ 3 / 5 ]:

Originally turned down flat by the British Board of Film Censors and initially released exclusively in London in a version heavily cut by its nervous distributor, The Beast is Walerian Borowczyks most notorious film, although its much wittier and more playful than its subject matter might suggest. More exploitation than horror, the film wildly reworks the classic Beauty and the Beast story into a very adult fairy take, a parody of pornographic tropes and an assault on notions of 'good taste'.

Lucy Broadhurst (Lisbeth Hummel) is due to inherit a substantial fortune, but on condition that she marries the son of her late fathers best friend. But Mathurin de lEsprance (Pierre Benedetti) seems more interested in his horses than in his bride-to-be, and when Lucy finds out about the story of his 18th-century ancestor Romilda (Sirpa Lane) and brings her to life in one of the most outrageous dream sequences in cinema history, we begin to realize just how bizarre Mathurins bloodline truly is.

A huge hit in France that was extensively censored and banned elsewhere, ""The Beast"" broke new ground in sexual explicitness and remains a truly startling experience even today.

This is the full uncut version of the film that is based on the short film, ""La Bte"" that appeared on the ""Immoral Tales"" Blu-ray, also from Arrow Video.

AUDIO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

There is one audio option on this Blu-ray and that is a French LPCM Mono 2.0 track. The audio sounds terrific on this release. I thought the dialogue, sound effects and score all sounded terrific and maintained a good volume level. The components of dialogue, sound effects and score were balanced well. I did not notice any problems such as drop outs or hissing in the audio. English subtitles are also included.

VIDEO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]

""The Beast"" roars on to Blu-ray in the United States thanks to Arrow Video. The film has received a new high definition digital transfer featuring the uncut version of the film. ""The Beast"" is presented in 1080p with a 1.66:1 Aspect Ratio. The video quality looks amazing. The colors look strong and natural without any artificial boosting of the contrast. Black levels look great as do skin tones. Film grain looks very good with a thin layer present throughout. Fans may be surprised by the large amount of fine detail present in close ups. Even in non-close ups, the film displays a very good sharpness. The high video quality makes it that much more enjoyable when looking at objects such as furniture, buildings, clothing and so on. There are a few instances of white specks and a scratch, but they are very seldom.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 4 / 5 ]:

DOCUMENTARIES:

Introduction by Peter Bradshaw (1:45) - When playing the film, viewers have the option to watch the film with an introduction by film critic, Peter Bradshaw.

The Making of ""The Beast"" - (57:56) Camera operator Nol Vry provides a commentary on footage shot during the films production. This documentary offers an interesting look behind the scenes of the film. You get to see Walerian Borowczyk staging scenes, exactly the way he wanted them to be shot and also instructing the actors how they should perform in their scene. Apparently the role of Lucy was originally to be played by Jeane Manson, but she had to be replaced after she disappeared for three days shortly after filming began. Fans of the film or director Walerian Borowczyk should enjoy this documentary.

Frenzy of Ecstasy (4:22)  - A visual essay on the evolution of Borowczyk's beast and the sequel that never was, Motherhood.

The Profligate Door (13:17) - A documentary about Borowczyks sound sculptures featuring curator Maurice Corbet. Some of the creations remind me of old toys with the noises that they make. (In French with English subtitles)

Boro Brunch (7:37) - This featurette is of a reunion dinner with some crew members that worked with Borowczyk. This was filmed in 2014 and organized by camera operator Nol Vry. (In French with English subtitles)

COMMERCIALS - Three commercials that Borowczyk made during his career.

Holy Smoke! (1963) (9:57) - The animation style reminded me of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus."" The story is about a man smoking a cigar, talking about the 'good old days' of cigars and society.

Tom Thumb (1966) (1:52) - A mix of animation and live action. This is an advertisement for pasta. (In French with English subtitles)

The Museum (1964) (1:52) - This too is a mix of animation and live action. It is an advertisement for the same company and pasta product as ""Tom Thumb."" (In French with English subtitles)

Gun Point (11:04) - A documentary short produced and edited by Walerian Borowczyk. The anti-hunting short film was directed by Peter Graham.

Behind Enemy Lines Documentary (5:16) - A short featurette about the making of ""Gun Point."" I enjoyed the story of how Peter Graham was able to get the footage by being a bit sneaky in regards to actual reason he wanted the footage for his short film.

Theatrical Trailer (4:02)

Reversible cover - Includes Borowczyk's own original poster design.

Illustrated booklet - Features new writing on the film by Daniel Bird and an archive piece by David Thompson, illustrated with original stills

IN CONCLUSION:

This Blu-ray and DVD Combo Pack from Arrow Video has superior Audio and Video quality. There are some nice special features included also. If you are a fan of this film or of Boroczyk's work, then you should enjoy this release. The subject matter won't be appealing to everyone, but if you enjoy exploitation films, or sexploitation to be even more specific, this will probably be right up your alley. ""The Beast"" has a bit more lighthearted humor to it at times, as opposed to similar genre films that are often more grim and vile in tone. Arrow Video has once again put out another fantastic product.

OVERALL - [ 4 / 5 ]",1447200000,3,6086,4.825
1643520,3,B00005OW2P,"Heres the lowdown  The Beast is a 1975 expansion of Walerian Borowczyks short piece The Beast of Gevaudan included in early versions of Immoral Tales, which Arrow Video included in their Blu-Ray edition of the film. If youve seen the short, then you know what to expect from The Beast, except that Borowczyk segments that short into the film as a dream sequence late in the final act. And so if the viewer did not enjoy the original short  whether because it was too long, or too disjointed, or too disturbing what with the bestial rape  then The Beast will not be ones cup of tea either.

In fact, Im not sure what kind of audience this film is directed toward. Unlike Immoral Tales, The Beast is a bit more intentionally erotic despite the bestiality that Borowczyk infuses both with horse rutting and with the dream sequence at the end of the film. Theres more straight-forward sex here; the black servant Ifany (Hassane Fall) has sex with Clarisse (Pascale Rivault)  the daughter of his master Pierre de lEsperance (Guy Trejan)  and when hes called away, she masturbates on the edge of a bed, and newly-engaged Lucy Broadhurst (Lisbeth Hummel) masturbates with a rose in a weird, what-could-that-feel-like kind of way.

But the eroticism is secondary to Borowczyks dry plot about the marriage between Lucy and Pierres odd son Mathurin (Pierre Benedetti), and The Beast, for nearly three-quarters of its runtime, focuses on this coming unity while awaiting the Cardinals arrival. There are some interesting ideas at work in the film  Borowczyk explores the horrifying depths Pierre will plunge just to get money from Lucys dowry, and he does do quite a bit to equate humanity and bestiality, then condemning the unity of the two.

But The Beast is a slow and tedious watch, full of dialogue that has very little worth. Its clear that Borowczyk is making an artful statement, but the point of it gets lost in an endless display of French wealth, female nudity, and then the tacked-on dream sequence recycled nearly scene-for-scene from Immoral Tales short. If one has seen that short, then theres really no reason to come back to The Beast. This is just an unnecessary extension of that idea, broadened to include French aristocracy and a story that only barely relates (the woman in the dream is supposed to be the ancestor of the lEsperance family, Romilda).

Its hard to recommend The Beast, then, as a vital film in Borowczyks canon. Its less disjointed than Immoral Tales, but  surprisingly  it has even less to say. Its an erotic film with little usable substance, and the message isn't really worth the slog. Ultimately, the short film in Immoral Tales is more than enough, and The Beast unsuccessfully attempts to reuse that footage and give it added context.

Like Arrows release of Immoral Tales along with this film, the Blu-Ray of The Beast has some seriously gorgeous video quality. This is probably the best the film is going to look, which means you get to see bush, vagina lips, and red roses in all their glory. Same is true with the audio, which sounds flawless. Its a great treatment of a film that, in my opinion, doesnt deserve it. But alas.

A video introduction to the film is included from Peter Bradshaw, who speaks very kindly of Borowczyks work. He actually makes it sound more impressive than it really is. Also like Immoral Tales, this Blu-Ray comes with reversible cover art and a 20-page booklet (cant comment on that since I don't have a physical copy).

For extras, the disc includes quite a few specials. Theres Boro Brunch, a gathering of people who worked on various Borowczyk films discussing memories of those times; Frenzy of the Beast, a special that highlights Borowczyks notes on the design of the Beast; The Making of the Beast, commentary from Noel Very with behind-the-scenes video footage; a video of Borowcyzks art; and a trailer for the film. Also included are a few commercials Borowczyk shot, as well as a short film Gunpoint with a commentary featurette.

This is a stacked Blu-Ray of special features, probably about two hours worth with the 57-minute The Making of the Beast. But their worth to regular viewers who may not be fans of Borowcyzk is questionable. The making-of featurette is rather boring; Gunpoint and the commercials have nothing to do with The Beast. Hardcore Borowczyk fans will enjoy the additional extras of his work; casual viewers will again want to steer clear of paying full price.",1447200000,2,4460,4.833333333333333
1643521,3,B00005OW2P,"The Beast has been praised as a 'genuinely erotic film', but it contains much less eroticism than the viewer might expect. Whatever mild eroticism the film possesses, it takes a backseat to all of the nonsense that occurs in and around a French manor/estate. Fortunately, it's the silly goings-on that save this film from being a lost cause. Included are the upper class, the clergy, the middle and lower classes, and something somewhat resembling a beast. People-watchers who enjoy and appreciate unusual behaviors and mannerisms might be amused by this farcical French drama, but it will fail to please those expecting real erotica, substance, or a standard easy-to-follow plot. What carried me through were the characters' minor eccentricities and what ultimately seems to ground the film: subtle comedy.

Unfortunately, The Beast will mostly be remembered for two things: a) copulating horses; and b) a crudely constructed phallus copiously ejaculating (in shameless circus-sideshow style). Some classify this as an 'art' film, but it's more of an art film pastiche, or, just a colorful, whimsical farce.

Without giving too much away, she has a dream involving a prior occupant of the house, who runs through the forest and is savaged by a beast.  Reality and fantasy collide as the man she's supposed to marry turns out to be the beast in human form.  There's all kinds of sexual activity [so this one isn't for the kids].  The version I have, bought elsewhere, Ebay, is  a three disc set, as stated in the disclaimer, which has a longer version, and a bonus disc, about the making of the movie [which, oddly enough, doesn't go into the filming of the ""beast"" scenes with the other woman], but it is a rare glimpse into the making of this (rightly) controversial film.  The sex will put off most people and the allegory is a bit hard to discern, at first, but the message is clear (as the Priest says towards the end).

This was when an 'Art Film' could play at a theater 6 months, a year or longer. I think we we warned about the sexual nature, the horses copulating. I'm curious to see now what the redeeming artistic value of this film is as, back then, I really didn't get it.

1643578,2,B00005OW2P,"Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way), what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.

The long (way too long) scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes of sheer madness and I'd say an abrupt ending. IMO, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. As a parody of art house/horror/erotica, it is funny and certainly original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of the curious Beauties and the lustful Beasts certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the children. The opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used On Discovery channel for the program like ""In the world of animals - mating habits and rituals of horses"".

The scene with the beast is ridiculous and would appeal only to the sexual level of a teenager and even then only one who had never come across bestiality and found it to be erotic.  The phallus in the scene looks like the rubberized end of a baseball bat with hand cream shooting out every 5-10 seconds.  While the overall story line and acting is reasonable, and the two r-rated sex scenes are passable the whole point of the movie is this scene which is laughable for its lack believability and true eroticism.

But there I was - the opening just couldn't tear itself away with two horses going at it (and the presumed male lead watching with way too much interest). As for the rest of it, the subtitles gave out pretty early on (and the English-language track was just terrible) so I don't really know the details of the plot, but they didn't seem too important. Woman goes to marry mysterious guy, masturbates a lot and then has a dream about some other woman having sex with a guy in a ridiculous animal suit. You sort of wonder how the mechanics work (i.e., how is that thing supposed to fit anywhere inside her), but not enough to really make it interesting, then there's a big, pointless revelation and you're just relieved they didn't go back to more horse sex.

But I found the secondary characters amusing and it seemed to have a point that it thought was way more interesting than it really was, so two stars.",1220486400,3,1014,4.451612903225806
1643600,4,B00005OW2P,"I won't bore you with yet another review of this film, suffice it to say I like this film enough to have splashed the cash on this 3 disk release. Having first seen it back in the 80's (in a slightly cut form) and thoroughly enjoyed it, it was only a matter of time before I sought it out on it's ultimate dvd release.
This is the definitive edition of this movie, containing both the directors cut (with both the original french language or the english dubbed audio) and the very rare ""complete version"", and as mentioned by other reviewers an awesome extras selection - albeit the majority of which has no audio.
Considering Walerian Borowczyk's involvement with producing the extras it is a pity that there's no directors commentary on any of the disks, and the lack of any audio at all throughout the ""Making of.."" is a shame - it would certainly have benefited from having the harpsichord soundtrack as a selectable audio track.
Upon purchasing this edition from amazon.com I first watched the ""complete version"", which although marred by far-from-perfect image quality and an obtrusive black-band containing the english subtitles (apparently to mask out the dutch subtitles that were imbedded in the original source print) it's almost worth the asking price alone.
Many months later (long after the period in which I could've returned it to amazon) I came to watch the directors cut... I prefer to watch movies in their original language with subtitles where possible, so selected the French audio with English subs. All was fine up to around twenty minutes into the film, but all of a sudden the subtitles stopped playing. They then pick up from the dialogue they stopped at around an hour later. It's the same on every player I've tried it on, and I even resorted to extracting the sub/idx files on my pc to see if I could figure out what the problem was, to no avail. I don't know if I just got unlucky with the disk amazon sent me, but it certainly seems to be an issue with the actual mastering of the data on the disk rather than being just a dodgy disk.
It is unfortunate that this problem has rendered the viewing of the directors cut in it's original language unwatchable, and I instead had to watch it with the English dubbed audio.
I fully intend to contact Cult Epics with regards to this issue and hopefully they will send me an error free disk as a replacement - although as a UK resident I'm partially expecting them to not bother (if I have to pay to mail the disks overseas, and potentially have to pay for the shipping on a replacement, it may even be cheaper to actually buy it again).
No one else seems to have had this issue, or perhaps no one else has watched disk 1 with the subtitles selected - but it's worth bearing in mind if you're considering buying this release.",1220313600,8,2798,4.575697211155378

1643606,3,B00005OW2P,"Walerian Borowczyk's explicit and insane la Bte (The Beast) is a directly adult reflection of the sexual undertones in many fairy tales.  There are segments in la Bte that are unflinching enough to be deemed pornographic but they are done in such a silly and shocking way we cannot assume that Borowcyzk's goals are to titillate.  I mean come on, the film opens with a close-up of a female horse's private parts and a male horse jumps right into the mix soon thereafter.  There is also a tremendous amount of (human) nudity in la Bte and while gratuitous, it does seem to be appropriate within the film, even though it isn't necessarily erotic.  I don't think it is possible to categorize this movie and that in and of itself is a strength for me.  From beginning to end, I had no idea what to expect.

The film takes place in the Esperance house that is awaiting a wedding between the family's son and Lucy.  The family is full of chaos and everyone seems to have something to hide.  Lucy becomes fascinated with the family's notorious ancestor Romilda, who apparently had a sexual encounter that Lucy reads about with a very well endowed beast in the woods nearby.  Lucy imagines the experience Romilda went through graphically, and she almost seems to fantasize about the ordeal.  We see the sequence almost in its entirety.  It consists of Romilda (Sirpa Lane) running around gradually losing her clothes with some harpsichord music playing and eventually she succumbs to the beast's advances and gets it on with his giant prosthetic phallus.  It is graphic enough that it would be nearly impossible to say it isn't shocking, but it is funny enough that the audience will laugh uncomfortably until it concludes.  You certainly won't forget this sequence and there are several more memorable parts before and after.

Just because someone may care I won't reveal how la Bte ends.  Walerian Borowcyzk actually does seem to have a way with making movies.  His other films are for the most part straight-forward erotica but he has the ability to make beautiful shots and here he even puts together an interesting, albeit strictly comedic, commentary on human and animal sexual impulse.  I don't want to mislead anyone here; the priorities of this movie are by no means it's potentially significant insights.  I don't know what Borowcyzk's intentions are but la Bte is certainly one of a kind.

The Cult Epics three disc release is worth owning if you enjoy rare and unique films.  Especially ones that push the limit like this one.  We have the dubbed version and the director's cut in here, as well as a great stills gallery and a hilarious trailer that shows almost the entire sequence with the beast and Sirpa Lane, but with a black bar over the graphic footage...as if we don't know what could be happening.  On the third disc we have over one hundred minutes of silent behind the scenes footage and several other interesting features.  The book that comes with this edition is probably the best aspect of the Cult Epics release.  It has stills of some of the more noteworthy content and explains the film in far better detail than I have.  This is recommended for collectors and definitely for those of us not easily offended.",1185148800,30,3230,4.755834829443447
1643607,4,B00005OW2P,"I thought this movie was hysterical.  I was prompted to rent it after reading so many reviews that raved about its high-brow eroticism.  I thought, ""Wow! A serious artsie movie about beastiality?  That's more pretentious than Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii""

  After viewing it with an open-mind, some popcorn, and a very good-sport of a guest, I have decided that it's well worth the purchase!  The first 3/4 of the movie are fairly generic w/o much in the way of plot developement or rich cinematography.  It rambles on rather slowly with the occasional clumsily erotic moment.  The last quarter of the movie, however, turns into a whole 'nother bag of ish.

  To me, it seems like the director decided to really take a different direction with this portion of the movie, and make something that would certainly generate some controversy.  He goes so far as to (beware of content proceeding) construct a huge gorilla phallus that spews out semen, upon which the star of the movie rubs her face in.  Totally rediculous!

  I was all at once shocked and laughing hysterically because it comes out of the blue.  The scene goes on for ages.  It looks like an old moster movie from the 1960s, with a guy in a silly gorilla suit and the star chasing each other around and having sex.  It cracked me up, scared me a little, and ultimately left me feeling like the subject of a practical joke.

  Believe me when I say people are looking into this movie a bit too much.  Its great, but not because it is an artistic masterpiece.  Its great to keep in the closet, and pop on once in a while to get unwanted company out of your house.  Its great to project on the sides of suburban houses at night.  Its great as a gift for a nun.  Its great to write reviews about and pretend thats its a high-end art film in hopes that people will watch it.

BUT IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I was prepared for the horses and I was prepared for the nudity and the eroticism. I was not prepared for the filmmaker's mangling of ""Beauty and the Beast"".  That is what the blurb on the box suggests. But instead of getting the Beauty and the Beast message of the redeeming power of love, you get a half-hearted sermon against bestiality. I didn't know that was such a problem in this world. I mean I have never had the urge and I don't know of anyone who has. There have been no reports on the news about people sexually assaulting livestock that I have heard. I am sure I would have heard something if such was the case. There is no excuse for what Borowczyk has done here. The movie starts out slow, I can forgive that, I have an attention span (too many people don't.) The story starts to pick up momentum and promise when the beast appears.

And the guy dressed in the beast costume, well, I guess they weren't that into special effects back then except for the ""gallons"" of ejaculate they used in the rape scene. Totally stupid! If this was great euro-sex of the 70's, I'll stay away from anything else produced by this guy.

This production is about intermixing species and what comes of it.

I received this film, not exactly knowing what to expect. I suppose for the reason it was made. I believe this film is a mark in history. If you know about the subject then you know that through history this has been going on, but this film introduced it into the world of cinema. The movie is slow and  equal to that of a BBS production. At times the movie is very boring and some parts should be left out, but it does set the plot.

1643643,3,B00005OW2P,"Said to be a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, I have to say that while there is a beauty and a beast, there is no curse mentioned.  This is a very strange tale that takes place in two different time periods.  In the present we have a planned wedding between and noble and an American girl.  In the flashes of the past, we see a young virgin ravished by the title creature.  These flashes are given in a way that they might be dreams of the American girl.

Other than the American girl most of the characters are very strange.  We have the father who shaves the son and then baptizes him in secret.  We have the priest who allows the baptism and kisses his alter boys.  The girl's mother does an astounding change of personality and rips the clothes off of another character.  The son is strange in more ways than I can describe.  There is no explanation given for the beast or any real connection to the present.  It is not even known if it is real or a fanciful dream explanation.  Whatever the case, the beast is literally fornicated to death during these flashes.  The American girl, while having her dreams, keeps trying to sneak into the bedroom of her intended, but keeps getting scared away.

In the end we have a strange film that seems to have had little point than to try and get by the censors.  Although the story takes place at a grand estate almost everything happens in two small rooms.  Once the film was over I found myself wondering just what was supposed to be conveyed to the audience.

1643646,3,B00005OW2P,"If the name ""Walerian Borowczyk"" doesn't ring a bell, don't feel inadequate. I am a self-professed film geek, and I had never heard of this obscure Polish director until I purchased this 3-disc limited edition of ""The Beast"" on a whim. Billed as an 'erotic' updating of ""Beauty And The Beast"", this 1974 gothic soaper mixes the unsettling sexual pathos of ""Equus"" with the bestial Freudian imagery of ""The Company of Wolves"". I think it is significant to note that this film was released the same year as ""Emmanuelle""; it utilizes a silmilar soft-focus Bob Guccione style of eroticism. The first hour of the film may try your patience, with it's poor-man's ""Upstairs Downstairs"" intrigues set at a crumbling French manor; but it is basically padding leading up to the film's infamous (and 'controversial', according to package notes) erotic dream sequence/frolic in the forest that takes up the final 20 minutes. Some reviewers have referred to this portion of the film as 'hardcore', but since the sequence in question stars a prosthetic about as 'realistic' as Mark Wahlberg's ""Boogie Nights"" enhancement, as well as other, er, 'special effects', can this he technically defined as 'pornographic'? (Discuss.). The 2004 limited edition (10,000 numbered copies) features a director's cut, a 'newly discovered' slightly longer version, and a third disc of interviews and 'making of' featurettes. Good widescreen transfer; audio is somewhat sloppily dubbed (on both French and English tracks) although I suspect this might be inherent on the master.

1643647,3,B00005OW2P,"I understand completely why some people would hate this movie, as is evidenced in the negative reviews.  But this is one of those what-you-see-is-what-you-get deals, so I can't understand why these people would look at the cover art, and read the back, which describes, ""a beast possessed by a giant phallus and an insatiable lust,"" and say to themselves, ""now that sounds like the feel-good hit of the year!""  If ""giant phallus"" and ""insatiable lust"" is not something you want to see, then please don't watch this movie, because they aren't fooling around.

The opening scene depicts horses mating, and it's painfully real.  I'm not exactly sure why the director wanted to open the movie that way.  And like many others have expressed, it's not something I really want to see, sex film or not, but I have to give him props, if only because it must have been very difficult to film!  How do you direct animals mating?  ""Cut!  Back up a minute, I'm not believing it!""

The story is an erotic take on the Beauty and the Beast tale.  An American heiress, Lucy, travels to Paris to meet with her arranged fiance so that they can marry and produce an heir.  The version I saw was a 3 disc special edition with a newly recovered complete version of the film with four minutes of extra dialog.  Gee, it's a good thing they found that, because I'm sure that is exactly what fans of this movie wanted to see--more dialog!  Lucy finds the diary of the Lady of the house from the 18th century, in which she describes being attacked by a beast living in the woods.  And you know what's so special about this beast...

While Lucy is in bed feeling lonely, since she can't marry her new husband until tomorrow, she imagines what happened that day in the woods.  We see a woman in a powdered wig being chased by what looks like a guy in a grizzly bear costume with a giant you-know-what protruding out the front of him.  It seems that his problem is that he ejactulates over and over again, and never goes limp, hence the ""insatiable lust.""

Lucy's fiance, Mathuin, is feeling insecure about meeting her, because he feels ugly.  He should really relax, because a woman who fantasizes about doing it with a ""beast"" isn't too particular about physical appearance.  He sends a rose to her bedroom, which she makes use of in her nether regions.  This didn't look like such a sexy idea to me, what with all the thorns and everything.  But she's careful, and only uses the petals.  The tight closeups mostly keep everything obscured by the petals, but offer breif glimpses of her womanhood.  I appreciated that, just because I could imagine the no-lifers who rent this pervy thing rewinding, freeze framing, and getting more and more frustrated, until they realize they should just have stuck with the back room for their viewing pleasure.  They could have their choice of DVD's that don't get convoluted with all the other garbage contained in ""La Bete,"" that us more evolved members of the human race like to call, ""story.""

While all this is going on, we flash back to the woman in the woods.  After being attacked, and taken by force, she changes course, and begins pleasuring the beast in a variety of ways.  Her change in attitude is not sudden, and if you watch the actress, you can actually see it happen gradually.  If this sounds disturbing, that's because it is.  But I find it to be a very interesting reading of Beauty and The Beast.  While the fairy tale has become a story of a female who learns to see inner beauty in a male she initially finds hideous, (while being valued mainly for her physical beauty by the male) it can also be interpreted as a story of sadism.  A female has an undesirable situation forced upon her until she learns to embrace it.

As I'm watching the beast and the woman perform every sex act in graphic detail, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to think of it.  Is it supposed to be funny?  Erotic?  Scary?  Shocking?  I don't know.  But I've always enjoyed erotic horror movies from the 70's that are neither sexy nor scary for reasons I can't explain.

I'll probably never watch La Bete again.  Although I would recommend it, provided you're into this kind of thing, and you know what you're getting yourself into.  It's pretty explicit, even by today's standards.",1100476800,14,4283,4.58893280632411

It's actually quite hilarious how the beast just has to find whatever it can to rub itself against. But the beautiful lady it gets to have its way with--and the lady fantasizing the whole thing while explicitly romancing the flower--make this an erotic winner. Excellent quality picture for its age, as well. If you're into nude women and just-short-of-porn behavior, it doesn't get any better than this. This is the definitive Euro-sleaze title.

as a lot of others have already said the monster and his pivate parts don't look too real but thats the idea thats what makes it erotic if it was treated more realistic it would have been gross its the fantasy of the girl and the beast that is erotic not the reality. and it is dated (thank goodness for that iwould hate to see this look like lord of the rings),  anyway if you like your films out of the ordinary or if you are sick of hollywood treating us all as teenagers then get a copy of this, put the kids to bed, grab the wife or whatever open your mind and go back to a time when adult film meant ADULT",1039564800,20,1644,4.0244648318042815

Well, I can't comment on the DVD version but I did laugh like a drain when I saw an (uncut) version of this on the telly (yes, the TV - in England, where, of course it's banned) a few months back. If a guy in an an unconvincing gorilla suit with a monster dildo masquerading as a real penis, splashing cream over a naked woman in the forest is your bag, then this is the film for you.
Personally, I think anyone who (ahem) swallows this film as any kind of serious attempt to explore sexual taboos (or whatever it's supposed to be) has got to be up in the trees themselves.",1037318400,33,746,4.26056338028169
1643677,3,B00005OW2P,"...I'm beginning to suspect the reason some of the more offbeat genre films that used to be so difficult to see were obscure because they weren't very good to begin with.  My latest disappointment is Borowczyk's THE BEAST.  It pretty easy to see which scenes contained the original footage and which were added to bring the film up to feature length.
I liked the original scenes, but found the added footage a rather dull elongation of the basic theme.  And it certainly doesn't take an Einstein to figure out the conclusion.
A young girl, along with her mother, arrive at the villa of a seedy count whose only son seems to be girl shy.  Around this point we see flashbacks about a female ancestor of the Count who was raped by a strange beast------who looks like a cross between a bear and a gorilla.  The flashbacks showing the beast chasing the Countess and ejaculating constantly at the sight of her, take up most of the original footage.  Oddly, if the struggles of the Countess to get away from the beast had been calculated to arouse him further, they couldn't have hit the mark any better.  Regrettably for the future, the countess finds the beast is the man for her and excites him to a marathon encounter in the woods.  Meanwhile, in the present, the son constantly keeps one hand bandaged with the excuse that he had an accident.  Ahhh, the sins of the mothers.
OK.  It's different.  The romantically shot sequences with the Countess and the beast in the past are quite good.  Too bad they weren't left in IMMORAL TALES (a fine film!) rather than being used as an excuse to add an hour to a film to bring it up to length...",1024790400,12,1634,4.520408163265306

At first she finds the beast scary but by force begins to have [relations] with the beast.  She has [contacts] with the beast so much the beast dies...
