Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture is a BBC series first aired on BBC Two in April 2008 in which British architectural historian Dan Cruickshank travels around the world visiting what he considers to be the world's most unusual and interesting buildings, structures and sites.  Cruickshank examines buildings as gigantic statements of the primary ideas within human society. Celebrating an extraordinary array of different types of architecture, he shows how our buildings reveal our aspirations, our ingenuity and our beliefs. In each programme, buildings from all over the world are dramatically juxtaposed, revealing unexpected connections between very different types of architecture.

The structures span the globe and are presented in groups organized by theme.
