One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After learning about the psychic powers gained by humans recently, Yusuke and his buddies learn of a new plot in the works. A tunnel to the demon world is being opened. Demons as strong as Toguro will be able to come to the living world and destroy it. There are seven human psychics that are trying to make this happen.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1548,4.205387205387205

8004805,5,B0000ZFZSM,"Okay..... you're stuck in a hospital, with the power cut.  People are falling sick left and right, and dozens of tiny bugs are out to get you.  One sting and you'll be fatally poisoned.  And you're also facing a complete psychopath who's out to kill you.  What do you do?  Well, that's the scenario Yusuke faces in the newest volume, and I must say it has to be the creepiest volume in the series.  Say, creepy on the lines of the X-Files.  As you recall, I reviewed this title before, but that was pretty much how much I was looking forward to it.  This is my real review after having seen and viewed the real product.  And I must say, Doctor Kamia takes my vote as the biggest lunatic in the series.  He's CRAZY.  My guess it has something to do with that Chapter Black tape.  But we won't find out yet now, will we?  That's what next volumes are for.  But back on the subject, this is another excellent entry in the series.  Yusuke's battle with the ""good"" doctor, with the shadowing and camera angles, is one of the creepiest fight scenes ever.  My advice:  Watch this in the dark.  Then try not to scream.  Have fun!  ^_^",1076716800,,1126,4.29665071770335
