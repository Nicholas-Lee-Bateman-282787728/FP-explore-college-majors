4083507,5,B00386OX4C,"I almost passed this one by on a cable marathon due to the generic title.  Reminds me a little of the Ghost Whisperer but with a more dark gritty edge to it.  Frank is a ex-cop turned detective who lost his child and marriage.  While on a case he dies and is then brought back, to the ghosts he's like a human glow stick.  All eleven episodes are excellent with great acting, writing and direction.  Like other great shows this one was canceled too soon.  At least they didn't leave us with a cliff hanger so you won't feel like you were left hanging.  Don't let the title fool you this is top notch television.  For bargain hunters this is available at Walmart for under 20 bucks.",1272240000,32,681,4.307086614173229
4083508,5,B00386OX4C,"Bought this series just to take a chance as I am a die hard Matthew Fox fan. I really don't have words for how creative the conception, filming and writing really are. This a series dead before it's time. Great story telling, a few truly spooky moments and some surprise guest stars (Pauly Perette pre NCIS) make it more than worth the price. If Matthew ever decides to come back to TV after LOST, I hope his clout convinces the powers that be to bring this on back.",1271462400,22,466,4.306818181818182
4083509,5,B00386OX4C,"I have been waiting for this fantastic series starring Matthew Fox for the last eight years to be released on DVD!!!

Matthew plays Police Officer Frank Taylor who has the perfect job and family until his son is abducted leading to his life, career and marriage destroyed. He becomes a Private Investigator specialising in missing and abducted children cases.

Frank's life is changed forever while trying to aprehend Simon a man linked to several child abductions. A fatal clash leaves Simon dead and Frank in a critical condition. As Doctors try to save his life, Frank has a near death experience in which he sees his missing son. When he regains consciousness, he finds that the dead can communicate with him and help him in his work to solve cases. However Simon and other dead people use his new abilities to intentionally mislead or harm him.

I live in the UK and one of my TV channels Zone Horror has just showed 11 episodes, it was shown on Sky in 2003. However I am hoping that the Complete Series on two DVD's contains the episode not shown, a Christmas episode called It's A Wonderful Afterlife.",1269907200,52,1108,4.671794871794872

4083573,1,B00386OX4C,"Well the description sounded pretty interesting. I waited to purchase until it dropped below $9.00 (since there are supposed to be only 11 episodes) - & it was a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!  First, there are NO SUBTITLES, all the episodes are dark (hard to see the action), in that it would have been nice for them to have turned on some lights while filming so you could SEE what's going on (they must have been trying to save some money - or they were attempting badly for ""moody and scary"").  All of the episodes are REALLY SLOW moving and DRAG! BORING!!!

A lot of us leave a TV on for ""background noise"" while we do other things, this show doesn't even make good background noise.  Since the episodes move SO SLOW, I would have to attribute it to bad writing & bad directing. I'm really surprised this show lasted 7 episodes on the air.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Definitely do NOT recommend, not even worth it if had been $5.",1395273600,,921,4.420118343195266

4083577,5,B00386OX4C,dont understand why the producer stop this show.  its a great show and should carry on.  At times it is quite frightening and the mysteries of it is also gripping and puzzling.  it is also sad and heartrending about the character.,1376438400,,230,4.560975609756097
4083578,5,B00386OX4C,Its a shame they took this show off the air. Very good acting. Wish  there where more episodes. If you enjoy Medium then you will enjoy this series,1376179200,,147,4.25
4083579,3,B00386OX4C,"The cast of this short-lived series is both likable and watchable, having gone on to become better-known after the show ended. Matthew (Lost) Fox, Russell (Grimm) Hornsby, Lynn (John Carter) Collins and Michael (The Unit) Irby are the main players, though the latter two are on a revolving door from episode to episode. Despite its title, the show isn't very chilling or even spooky. The 11 episodes sometimes seem longer than their allotted time, with a few nice surprises in the mix. A pre-NCIS Pauley Perrette is probably the most-recognizable guest star next to a couple of young CSI:NY mainstays. The most frustrating thing about the set, however, is the fact that the major plot is never resolved. The final episode was, apparently, not the final episode of the series, just the last one to air and the last one included on the disc. I say this only because Matthew Fox is credited for 12 episodes and the discs have only 11. A complete season one might have made this a better set, but who's to say for sure? Also, the pilot is (effectively) set in Seattle but the rest of the series is set in Los Angeles without a single mention of the change. It tries to capitalize on the same energy as the series Angel, in that regard, but never quite gets there.

Worth seeing for the cast, but the only truly haunting aspect is the lack of an ending.",1376179200,,1348,4.570247933884297

LISTEN TO THEM! You don't get the hours of your life back after you watch it (even if you fast forward through the really boring parts). This show could have been really good and it just wasn't--I'm still not sure why, since it was based on a good idea, used good actors, had a budget. And even after watching a number of episodes just hoping it would get better, it just didn't. And sadly, it wasn't even funny in it's badness (you know how some shows are so bad you can actually get a really good laugh about it while you're watching it? Not this one.) Save your money and your time and don't bother with this show--really. (Well, unless you're a Matthew Fox fanatic and would love watching him even with the sound off--then you might like it.

After nearly losing his life in pursuit of the killer he leaves the force and discovers he's developed the ability to see and hear ghosts, including the ghost of the dead child killer. He becomes a private detective, aided by his old partner who's still on the force and his now ex-wife, an assistand DA.  Without revealing too much more let's just say nothing is as it seems in the cases or the now dead child killer.  Unfortunately, the show was cancelled before the next season and the mysteries of the unanswered questions will remain.

4083590,4,B00386OX4C,"...it would definitely be this one. Even in 2002 Matthew Fox was an impressive actor, and although I grew to love Jack Shephard on LOST by the end of the show, I mourn the fact that Frank Taylor only existed for not even a half a season, because he is so much more sympathetic and likeable (than Jack was) from the get-go. I liked all of the episodes, some more than others - I loved the Pilot and ""Grievous Angels"", and got a kick out of seeing Frank possessed by the ghost of a dead cop in ""Noturne."" My favorite episode was ""Last Call,"" because I'm a sucker for love stories.

Unlike some of the other reviewers I haven't had a problem with the writing or the Special Effects (although I did snicker a few times, but I do that for a lot of supernatural/ horror shows/films). The only problem I've had is with the acting of the extras, particularly in the episode ""Fidelity."" It was painful, seeing Matthew Fox's wonderful acting capabilities oposite of that of the guy who played the husband of one of the murdered women found in a hotel. I won't go further into that episode, because I don't want to spoil it, but I didn't think much of that guy...

I would definitely recommend this show for those who are willing to watch it even though it died so prematurely. It deserves the attention!

NOTE: I did notice that the episodes are out of order on the DVDs -- the episode ""Abby"" was the fourth episode aired, but is on the second disc, and this led to much confusion for myself when I watched ""Nexus"" or ""Blind Witness"" (can't remember which one) on the first disc, and the recap at the beginning had a clip of Frank and Marcus talking that happened in ""Abby"" (I won't elaborate further, because of spoilers). According to the airdates on a website, the episode order should be this:

1) Pilot
2) Grievous Angels
3) Fidelity
4) Abby
5) Blind Witness
6) Nocture
7) A Three Hour Tour
8) Nexus
9) Simon Redux
10) Last Call
11) Seeking Asylum

I don't know why the episodes are out of order on the DVD, but I would recommend watching ""Abby"" as the fourth episode, then continuing in whatever order you want to follow, just because it makes more sense to do that. How come nobody double checks to make sure mistakes like this are avoided...?",1296518400,18,2240,4.414043583535109

My Mom is a huge fan of LOST since I turned her on to it, and she really likes the Ghost Whisperer too, so I think she will enjoy this.  I like it, had never seen it before.  I only knew about it from a video I seen on you tube, ""Campetin LOST IPFS5 Meet The Cast II"", only the show was mistakenly named ""hunted"" so I had a really hard time finding it. Actually I gave up, and then months later I figured out it was called Haunted when I looked at a list of work done by mathew fox.  I rated it 4 stars. The reason why I took off a star is because there was no finale or ending episode.  It would be nice if they had ended it and given some closure to the series so we could find out what happened to Kevin. Then it would have been worthy of 5 stars.",1292716800,3,897,3.8162162162162163

I CHECK NETFLIX OFTEN AND DID SO AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THIS SUPPOSED RETAIL-RELEASE LISTED HERE ON AMAZON..... FINALLY. BUT LO & BEHOLD...IS THIS REALLY A LEGITIMATE RETAIL RELEASE? ALL THE PAST OWNERS SELLING THEM AND REVIEWERS REVIEWING THEM SEEM TO THINK SO, BUT UNLESS THE RIGHTS WERE BOUGHT FROM PARAMOUNT/UNIVERSAL, AS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK DOWN ALL MY LISTINGS ON IOFFER FOR THE SAME MATERIAL, I HIGHLY DOUBT IT.

ALSO,I FIND IT ODD THAT A LEGITIMATE RETAIL RELEASE OF THIS SET WOULD:

#1 NOT INCLUDE BONUS MATERIAL?
MY SET INCLUDES THE UN-AIRED PILOT, WHICH THIS SO-CALLED LICENSED COPY DOES NOT..WHICH CAN ONLY MAKE ME THINK ONE THING..

#2 PHOTOS OF THE BACK DVD CASE SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE EPISODES MAY ALSO BE OUT OF ORDER. SET SHOULD HAVE 12 EPISODES INCLUDING PILOT EPISODE AND IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:

0-UN-AIRED TEST PILOT

4083597,3,B00386OX4C,"the shows that i saw didn't seem bad, but as a millenium fan here are the similarities: former cops named frank, one whose child is taken the other his wife, after dealing with their family crisis gain the ability to see things help to solve crimes and are able to walk onto crime scenes (in Seattle) that they shouldn't have access to with the help of current cop buddies, meanwhile they get nagged by their exwives and talk about how they see into the darkness. the pilot of haunted even uses the same background music as millenium. in the haunted however, they went the ghost route instead of serial killers with a hint of the demonic. they also tone down the violence and make the actor younger (which they wanted to do with millenium). Anyway... the shows that i saw seemed good enough but after seeing 3 years of millenium it just seemed like a knock off version which was trying to appeal to a new crowd.",1277596800,2,911,4.461077844311378

4083599,4,B00386OX4C,"Before becoming one of the stars of ABC's hit series ""Lost"" Matthew Fox starred in the short-lived 2002 series ""Haunted"".  The show broadcast only seven of the eleven produced episodes on the UPN network before being canceled.  The complete series with all eleven episodes is now out on DVD courtesy of Phase4 Films.  Haunted's biggest mistake was that it arrived too early.  Just two years later in 2005, several similarly themed shows like ""Ghost Whisperer"", ""The Medium"", and ""Supernatural"" would debut and become staples in the primetime TV schedule.

Fox is former police detective and current private investigator Frank Taylor.  His life and marriage was shattered a couple of years earlier by the unsolved abduction of his young son.  His ex-wife Jessica (Lynn Collins) is a lawyer with the local District Attorney's office so the two frequently interact over the course of the series.  As the pilot episode opens Frank is on the trailer of a suspected child molester who he thinks may be connected to his son's disappearance.  Taylor chases the suspect, Simon Dunn, to the roof of an apartment building where Dunn stabs Taylor before falling to his death.  As Frank lies on a hospital operating table he has an out of boy experience where he sees his son and other people walking into a light.  Frank is revived but brings a bit of the spirit world back with him.  He can now see and hear spirits although they are not always friendly or helpful.  In fact, the spirit of Simon Dunn haunts him throughout the series run, constantly taunting Frank.

Over the next ten episodes Frank investigates a number of murders and encounters spirits who both try to help and hinder his investigations.  Early on the episodes were almost straight cop drama with moderate supernatural elements.  This might partly explain the low ratings for the show as it didn't seem to want to fully embrace its paranormal side.  Later episodes would display more supernatural plots.  The most notable of these was ""Three Hour Tour"" when Frank is injured in an accident along a country road and is taken in by a family living in a cabin in the woods.  Frank becomes friends with the little girl but begins to notice something odd about her reclusive parents.  This episode was one of the highlights of the series and broke out of its murder-of-the-week mold.

Another key episode was ""Simon Redux"".  Frank begins to investigate the ghost that continues to haunt him and finds out that Simon Dunn is not the man Frank thought he was.  Simon is not happy with Frank prying into his past, and possesses the body of Jessica's new boyfriend to threaten her life.  This one of the more terrifying episodes of the show as Simon (played by John Mann) was a strong villain who you knew was capable of doing real harm to Jessica.

""Haunted"" was somewhat of a breeding ground for future genre TV stars.  Besides Fox, Zachary Quinto, Robert Knepper, Jessalyn Gilsig of ""Heroes"", and Ken Marino of ""Reaper"" all made appearances on the show.  The series didn't have a great deal of special effects.  Early on the ghosts were simply actors in makeup visual effects consisted mainly of objects moving on their own.  As the series progressed the effects got a bit more elaborate with ghosts becoming transparent but there certainly wasn't much in the way of CGI effects.

The cancelation axe came suddenly so the show was not able to go out under its own terms.  The last episode, ""Seeking Asylum"" has Frank going undercover in an asylum.  There's nothing special about the last episode and several plot threads are left unresolved.  If ""Haunted"" had come along a few years later there's a chance that it may have been successful or at the very least, made it through one full season.  But if the show had been a hit we'd have not had Matthew Fox in `Lost"" so perhaps it was for the best.",1276214400,4,3850,4.748493975903615

I'm curious to know if anyone can confirm or deny Amazon's listing this as anamorphic widescreen.
Both the original broadcast and the subsequent DVD release were 1.33:1 fullscreen.  If this is, indeed, anamorphic widescreen, I'd also be curious to know if it was filmed as open matte, or is it zoomed/cropped?",1528416000,,431,4.972222222222222

8391109,1,B00386OX4C,"Supposedly this series is about a police detective married to an assistant district attorney whose four years old son disappears so he lost his son then his wife then his job.  He becomes a private investigator.

Supposedly he is looking for his son, but he does everything except really look for his son.

He almost dies then from then on he can see, talk to, and be physically threatened by dead people which helps him solve crimes.

Yes you have seen this story or versions of it before.

To make it even more unbearable it is filmed mainly half to no light to evoke film noir or nightmares

There are many logical inconsistencies & some really terrible acting.

For example, whoever heard of a dog that almost never needs to go outside?  And can be left alone inside for what seem like days?

Since when do police detectives sport prison tattoos?  Or why would a nice charming guy like Matthew Fox be from the hood?",1515542400,,919,4.515151515151516
