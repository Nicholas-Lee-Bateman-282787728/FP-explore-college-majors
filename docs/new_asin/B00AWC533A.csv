8558312,1,B00AWC533A,I returned this DVD. It was not my thing. It was a walk through swamp land with no variety or change in the scenery.,1480377600,2,116,3.875
8558313,5,B00AWC533A,Arrived fast.  Great scenery for exercising.,1474243200,,44,6.333333333333333
8558314,5,B00AWC533A,"I have a small collection of virtual walk dvd's and this one is one of my favorites, despite the fact it is presented in standard definition. This is the real Florida - wild, untouched, and not a condo in sight. Video keeps my eyes off the clock during exercise. Recommended!",1438214400,,275,4.52
8558315,5,B00AWC533A,This was the first walking video I purchased and it is wonderful. I had just gotten back from Florida and saw this so bought it right away.  I can't walk outside so I use these videos to step walk in front of the TV or ride my exercise bike.  When step walking I also use arm exercises to increase my heart rate.  These are great.  I wish someone had come out with these years ago.  Can't wait to add more to my collection.,1416960000,2,423,4.048192771084337

This video is a great escape into nature....the only sounds you hear are the (mostly) birds that happen to be in the vicinity as the footage is being shot.  Although the camera is usually aimed straight ahead, stops are made with the camera panning to one side or another so that you can stop and enjoy the scenery.  The video is smooth...and I really can't figure out why there weren't some wobbles as the photographer navigated a few really skinny boardwalks or some shaky looking stepping stones....if I'd been the photographer, I'm pretty sure I'd have been looking down the whole time to make sure I didn't fall.

The pace of the walk is listed as being about 3 mph. and I'd say that's pretty accurate....I walk at 4 mph. and it was a bit slower than what I would have been doing on an exercise walk.  I bought this to use on my stationary bike, though, and not a treadmill, so the speed didn't matter at all to me.

I love that there was no additional sound with this video....I like to listen to only what Mother Nature has to offer when I'm outside.  If you, on the other hand, prefer music or whatever on your walks, you could easily play whatever you wish without interfering with what's on the video or having your choice interfered with by the video sounds (of course, there's the mute button if you so desire).

I can also see me using this versatile video as a relaxation tool....with or without additional relaxation music....from the vantage point of a comfy chair.

I bought a bunch of videos from these folks and am looking forward to watching the others (this was my first).",1391385600,,1662,4.513333333333334
8558317,5,B00AWC533A,"This is one of my favorites.  Peaceful, calm, and beautiful.  I feel as if I am walking in the Everglades and listening to nature at it's most centering.  Quite wonderful....
