844689,5,6304331053,"Update: Thankfully, a DVD has been released for this movie in the United States

This is one of my favorite World War 2 movies, but if you want to see it on DVD today (April 2006) you will need a region-free player as it has yet to appear in the format here in Region 1.
Luckily, I have a region-free DVD player and the Region 2 DVD that includes a nice, informative documentary shot at the time of the movie's production that talks extensively about the historical basis for the script. It's a worthwhile purchase, but I am baffled by the lack of any such release for North American DVD collectors who do not have region-free players.
Though not exactly the most historical accurate of movies, this film (like the similarly Hollywood-ized BATTLE OF THE BULGE) is true to the heroic spirit of the participants. In fact, whereas this movie shows the resistance fighters arranging for the children on the ferry to wear lifejackets so they can be saved from drowning. In actual fact the Norwegian partisans were under orders from London not to attempt a rescue and were long gone by the time the ferry sank.
In reality the first attempt at attacking the Norsk Hydro plant, ""Operation Freshman"", a British glider commando raid, ended with one tow plane crashing, killing both the crew and commandos. And a second glider crashing, leading to the death of some in the accident with the rest executed by the Gestapo.
An attempt by the United States Army Air Force to destroy the Norsk Hydro plant from the air failed, the British then turned to the Norwegian section of SOE. Eight of these attacked the plant, did tremendous damage and escaped without loss.
The Germans then decided to move the heavy water and its production equipment to Germany. It was American born Knut Haukelid and an another Norwegian who planted the charges than sank the ferry Hydro and defeated the Germans' attempt to build an atom bomb.
The movie details the allied attempts to disrupt the production of heavy water in Norway (an element vital to the development of the atomic bomb) and therefore covers much the same ground as the also excellent 633 SQUADRON. But whereas that movie covers the efforts of the RAF to bomb the plants, this production details the efforts of the Norwegian resistance to first detonate explosive charges n the plant and then to sink a ferry carrying the heavy water back to Germany. As a result these movies have different strengths and challenges.
While 1964s 633 SQUADRON relies heavily on the difficulty of training for and executing an aerial bombing of a plant shielded by a mountain and guarded by heavy anti-aircraft defenses. The movie HEROES OF TELEMARK (from 1965) takes its suspense more from the human element. And as such, the two leads Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris turn in excellent performances. Douglas as the determined scientist who believes himself superior to the fighters because of his intelligence and Harris as the resistance leader who questions the rationale of the raids and the cost in human lives of the attacks.
Confronted with evidence that the Nazi's are producing heavy water for use in the development of an atomic bomb, Norwegian scientist Dr. Rolf Pedersen (Douglas) demands that he gain passage to England to confer with British scientists. After hijacking a Norwegian vessel for this purpose he returns with resistence leader Knut Straud (Harris) with a mandate approved by the exiled Norwegian royal family to destroy the plant. The first attempt at placing charges results in a mere delay, leading the resistance to consider the loss of civilian life from a ferry sinking versus a (at that time) largely theoretical super-weapon.
This movies true audience is the lover of Boys Own adventure movies. [...]",1145577600,12,3748,4.883830455259027
844690,3,6304331053,"""The Heroes of Telemark"" was based on three different accounts of what the Norwegian Underground had undertaken to sabotage the Nazi machine operating in occupied Norway during World War II. The heavy water plant operated by Norsk Hydro in Vemork just west of the town of Rjukan was taken over by the Nazis in hope that they would develop a hydrogen bomb. There had been an earlier film I've seen on VHS released in Norway called ""Kampen om Tungtvannet"" (the Struggle for the Heavy Water) (1947) with nearly all of the surviving saboteurs from both the ""Swallow"" and ""Gunnerside"" groups playing themselves. In reality, all of the saboteurs survived this particular operation. One or two had been killed in later campaigns, which also appeared in ""The Heroes of Telemark"". There was a scene where the Nazis were shipping the heavy water in railroad cars to be taken to Berlin and a portion of the trip would be transporting it aboard a passenger ferry across one of Norway's deepest lakes. Three of the saboteurs slipped unnoticed onto the ferryboat to set charges to blow it up once it reached the deepest part. In reality none of them remained aboard the ferry to play a game with children ""race to the lifeboats"" in order to save lives. These heroic men, though they had hoped to save lives of innocent men, women and children, were under orders from London that nothing could be done to save them and the plan had to be carried out even if it meant the loss of innocent lives. The saboteurs were long gone in the mountains before the ferry was sunk after the charges went off.

The movie was exciting to watch with stars like Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris playing the saboteurs, even if some of the portions were fictional mixed in with the real events that occurred. The actual operation to set the charges inside the heavy water plant took exactly four minutes with two of the men slipping inside the building and holding an elderly Norwegian guard at gunpoint until the charges were set. A third man came in through a window he broke and assisted with the charges. After the charges were set, the three men ran out of the room and ordered the guard to flee immediately. the saboteurs were long gone before the alarm was sounded after the charges went off. The Nazis were a little slow to react, especially monitoring the radio waves. They did locate the exact position of the small cabin where ""Swallow"" and ""Gunnerside"" transmitted messages to London. None of the Norwegians were present when the Nazis reached the abandoned cabin they later set ablaze.

The scene with the one captured saboteur who makes a daring escape from the bus was in fact based on one of the members of ""Swallow"", Claus Helberg, who was arrested by the Nazis and was being transported to the concentration camp ""Grini"" when he made his escape. He was shot at, but managed to escape from his captors unscathed.

Great movie, but based on three different accounts.",1117411200,11,2946,4.705426356589148
844691,4,6304331053,"Based on a true story. Norwegian resistance fighters sabotage the Nazi German effort to produce heavy water for German atomic research during World War Two.  Breathtaking snowy Norwegian locations serve as a beautiful backdrop for the plot.  Kirk Douglas superbly plays the role of a Norwegian physics professor who, though originally content to wait out the war, is soon pulled heart and soul into the struggle.  Though somewhat toned down from the book of the same name (The Germans were much nastier in the printed version), the spirit of the conflict is accurately portrayed without the superhuman fiction that is found in other war movies of the 1960's.

844821,3,6304331053,"The Heroes of Telemark, 1966 film

It begins at night, there is shooting at German troops. An officer orders the shooting of hostages. The Norsk Hydro plant collects heavy water (deuterium oxide); the Germans order increased production. A man brings an undeveloped photographic negative as a message to a man; his response is I must get to England. A boat leaves with people on it; they take over the ship in the name of the loyal Norwegians and the King of Norway (the government in exile). Will it be stopped? Can a mine be blown up with a pistol shot? Or pushed away with a long pole? Heavy water has qualities that make it useful for research in atomic physics. If the Germans are ahead in research their atomic bomb will win the war! The Norsk Hydro plant must be destroyed in a manner that will reduce civilian deaths. Two scientists are returned by parachute, then travel by skiing to friends.

That professor meets his ex-wife. They attend church on Sunday and sing Silent Night. A message is passed about future production. A stray rabbit sets off a land mine near the plant! A German officer inspects Rolfs identity card. A ground attack on the factory is totally impossible, so too a bombing attack by airplanes. How to minimize civilian hostages? What is so important about heavy water? There is a personal conflict over this; they will let London decide. A stranger happens to see them; what will they do with him? A British assault force is wiped out; what can be done next? Can a small group invade the factory and plant dynamite to destroy it? They put an explosive cord around the collectors. A German guard checks the locked doors! The explosions set off the alarms. There is shooting in the dark, but the intruders get away. Can they reach Sweden? The Germans inspect the damage. How long to resume full production? One year or one day?

Order are to get the attackers dead or alive. Hostages are taken for reprisals. Two men try to evade their pursuers. Rolf is meets the Germans and claims to be helping hunt the saboteurs, but is discovered and captured. But Rolf escaped from the bus! He is told about the restoration of production, London must be informed. The entire load of heavy water will be shipped by ferry to Germany, guarded by 1,000 troops. This is a new opportunity. Placing bombs on the ferry would sink in the deepest part of the lake where it could not be recovered. [Would they use an audible alarm clock instead of a silent chemical fuse?] The bombs explode, a waiting ship evacuated children and passengers. The ferry sinks below the waters.

This movie is slow-moving, the many dark scenes make it harder to follow. But that may have kept production costs down. Was it true to the facts or dramatized? Overall, yes. Sinking the ferry with all the heavy water minimized those who would be shot as hostages, and allow its future recovery. It is worth watching but is only an average movie.",1495670400,,2928,4.635838150289017

845094,3,6304331053,"THE HEROES OF TELEMARK is a late entry in the cycle of British war movies that reached its apotheosis in the mid-Fifties with THE DAM BUSTERS (1953) and others.

Made by the Rank Organization, with an American star and a director with a proved track record of war movies and westerns, THE HEROES OF TELEMARK tells the story of the Norwegian Resistance and their campaign to destroy a plant manufacturing ""heavy water,"" - i.e. material that could help to create the atom bomb. At first the Resistance blows up the plant, but when that scheme fails, they end up destroying a ferry carrying the ""heavy water"" across a fjord on the first stage of its long journey to Germany. The fact that some innocent passengers get killed as well is part of what might be called collateral damage.

There are some obvious stereotypes here, especially in director Anthony Mann's portrayal of the Germans, who all speak English in accents reminiscent of the comic officers in the Eighties sitcom ALLO ALLO (""We hev vays of mekink you talk""). Anton Diffring has a small role as Major Frick, but it is not really developed in any way.

By contrast the Resistance fighters, led by Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, are portrayed as indefatigable, fearless in the face of impossible odds, and totally committed to their cause. Their characters are likewise not really developed: Douglas does his usual turn of a stone-faced hero, while Harris reveals some of the rebel- like qualities characteristic of THIS SPORTING LIFE (1963). Michael Redgrave has a cameo role as a pipe-and-slippers type, who is ultimately provoked into defending his property.

In truth the film is mostly memorable for its action sequences. Shot in Norway, it contains some spectacular moments where the Germans pursue the Resistance fighters on skis across rolling mountain landscapes. Later on Harris and Douglas have great fun trying to plant explosives in the doomed ferry, while listening out all the while for potential intruders.

We all know what the film's outcome will be; but it proceeds to that predictable conclusion in highly entertaining fashion.",1456963200,,2110,5.017142857142857

845366,3,6304331053,"NOTE: This review is based on the 2011 Columbia Combat Classics DVD, which is the version I watched. Many earlier reviews are based on foreign DVDs.

""The Heroes of Telemark"" tells a relatively unknown story of Norwegian resistance fighters who were instrumental in helping to stop the Nazi atomic bomb efforts. The story is fascinating, the movie somewhat less so, and the DVD transfer even less so.

Although both the Allies and Nazis knew the theory behind atomic fission during World War II, actually obtaining fissionable material was a different story. A key step in the process involved the use of heavy water, water containing a relatively rare hydrogen isotope having an extra neutron, hence the ""heavy"" title. A plant in Norway, then occupied by Germany, was capable of manufacturing large quantities of heavy water, which, when transported back to Germany, could significantly speed up the process of developing fissionable uranium.

When the Allies learn of the factory, members of the Norwegian resistance are sent to destroy it and its contents. The leader is Knut Straud (Richard Harris,) and he's accompanied by Rolf Pedersen (Kirk Douglas), Norway's leading physicist, who originally tipped off the Allies about the plant. The two, aided by a small band of commandos, first attempt to destroy the factory. Later, when the Germans try to transport their stock of heavy water out of the country, the commandos have to blow up the ferry transporting the water, thus sending it to the bottom of a fjord hundreds of feet deep. Naturally, the two of them bicker and fight along the way. Pedersen was originally a pacifist who questioned the wisdom of random resistance attacks that resulted in heavy Nazi reprisals. However, he realizes the threat a German atomic bomb poses, so he approves of the mission.

""Heroes of Telemark"" is much more about story than character. Other than Douglas and Harris, most of the rest of the cast are stock stereotypes, with only Ulla Jacobsson, as Douglas' ex-wife who helps hide out the commandos, making any impression. Douglas is commanding as usual, although the idea that the country's leading nuclear physicist is also adept at shooting and slugging it out with the Nazis defies credibility. ""Heroes"" was the last movie directed by Anthony Mann, and it shows his usual attention to background, with a number of spectacular shots from actual Norwegian locations. At times, however, the scenery overwhelms the story. The movie drags a good bit, with too many cross country ski sequences and not enough of the actual story. It could easily have been shortened by a good 20 minutes. In addition, the actual action sequences seem a bit of a letdown, although the finale on the ferry, in which Douglas and Jacobsson board the ferry and try to get as many civilian cjo;drem as possible to safety once the explosives go off, is quite suspenseful.

I was also a bit disappointed in the DVD of the movie. While obviously better than the foreign version that was the only DVD available before 2011, the picture is too dark in parts of the movie, especially in the beginning (you can see it visibly brightening and darkening in the middle of the same scene). Also, there's a good bit of grain, more than usual for major studio productions of this era. Fortunately, most of the video problems occur only in the first 30 minutes of the movie.

Based on the movie itself, I would give ""Heroes of Telemark"" four stars as a good example of the type of action star vehicle popular in the 1960s and the basis in historical fact (although it admittedly plays games with the actual timelines involved). However, I'm deducting a star for the indifferent DVD presentation. It's not the worst I've seen, but for a movie of this caliber, it should have looked better.",1422748800,,3793,4.909516380655226

845528,5,6304331053,"It has been said that one of the great ironies of history is that all the scientists who were working on atomic physics in the 1930s were Jewish.  The rise of the Nazis left Germany without any atomic scientists of any merit, and Hitler didn't trust them, anyway, calling the work of Einstein and Oppenheimer ""Judenphysik.""  So the Nazis searched for loyal, subservient scientists to look into the possibility of making an atomic bomb for the Hitler/Nazi war machine.  In reality, they never came close to designing anything that would work, but in the heat of war, we couldn't be sure of that, and it looked like a really dangerous situation for the allies.  A big part of the Nazi atomic research effort involved Deuterium Oxide, or ""heavy water,"" which they were producing in Norway at a converted fertilizer plant.  The Norwegian resistance mounted a risky but essential effort to destroy the plant, using commandos supported by the Allies.

Directed by Anthony Mann

Norway has fallen under Nazi occupation, and under the order of the German military, a factory is producing ""heavy water""  - a key ingredient in the manufacture of atomic weapons. A leading figure in the Norwegian underground, Knut Straud (Richard Harris), joins forces with scientist Dr. Rolf Pederson (Kirk Douglas) and British intelligence agents to destroy the factory, hoping to keep the Atomic Bomb out of Axis hands. However, while originally Straud and Pederson are only supposed to infiltrate the factory as a reconnaissance force while awaiting British troops, the English army is forced to retreat from their plans, leaving the Norwegians to destroy the factory and scuttle a shipment of the ""heavy water"" all by themselves.

Great direction by Anthony Mann who gave us the James Stewart westerns from the 50's, Bend of the River, Naked Spur, The Far Country, and The Man from Laramie - gives this film his same full attention to detail and action.

Inspired by a true story, this is a fabulous big budget espionage and adventure tale

845880,4,6304331053,"As World War 2 films go, I'd put THE HEROES OF TELEMARK somewhere in the middle of the pack. While it's an impressively made film, I think the script fails to develop the sense of terrible urgency that made this sabotage operation imperative. The film does not convey the utter destructive potential the Nazis were striving to achieve. This flaw is apparent in several key scenes, mainly the one where, after running dangerous risks to reach England, Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris are greeted by British officials who act as if they're giving a tea party. No briefing, no talking about nuclear destruction. Here, TELEMARK lacks the sense of desperate crisis facing the group in THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, OPERATION CROSSBOW, or WHERE EAGLES DARE. At some point, Kirk Douglas should have described to his ex-wife, played by the lovely Ulla Jacobsen, the devastation the Nazis planned to unleash on the planet.
Another component that's missing is a solid music score to back the action. There are sequences where the contribution of a Jerry Goldsmith, Elmer Bernstein, or John Barry would have supplied the extra ingredient to heighten the film's suspense. Malcolm Arnold's spare score falls flat. Imagine the thrilling chase on skis in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE without John Barry's hard-edged music backing it, or Gregory Peck & David Niven setting the charges to blow the guns of Navarone without Dimitri Tiomkin's music urging them on. TELEMARK is like that.
What the movie does have going for it is the masterful camera eye of director Anthony Mann [EL CID, FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, etc.] Mann's widescreen compositions of the breathtaking Nordic scenery are first rate, and his handling of action sequences is superior. Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris register fine performances.",1310860800,2,1787,5.081632653061225

No reason to go into the plot except to say that some liberties were taken compared to the factual account - this is a movie, not a documentary.

845984,5,6304331053,"Love this film. GET THE REGION 2 DVD -- the ONLY one that has been remastered properly.  Get a region-free DVD player -- they don't cost that much nowadays.

This is an update of my original review which covered an inferior VHS transfer copy.  Now that the official REGION 1 copy is available, I wanted to give warning.  I am now giving this movie the 5 stars it deserves -- BUT ONLY FOR THE REGION 2 release.

Unfortunately, Amazon reviews are lumped together for the ""same"" product in different formats or from different sources.  So all of the reviews of this film are on ALL of the versions.

The REGION 1 copy of this film with the top heading of ""Combat Classics"" is just okay.  It is almost impossible to distinguish detail in the night scenes, such as the raid on the factory and the loading of the train onto the ferry.  The daytime scenes are brighter but the whole film is somewhat washed out.

The other non-region copy with a blueish square cover is unwatchable.

It is too bad Columbia (or Sony Home) has not seen fit to remaster this great WWII movie for a Region 1 release.

My REGION 2 version of this film is fine, bright and clear, great colors.  It is not a VHS transfer but a digitally remastered DVD, which also includes a short documentary of the making of the film.  The colors are bright and the night scenes are clear.  Also, the film is shown in the original widescreen format (filmed with Panavision lenses in 1965).  This copy is now available on Amazon and at Amazon.uk  It has orange artwork on the cover.

Carltonvisual.com is the distributor or maker of the Region 2 dvd.",1303430400,3,1604,4.472413793103448
845985,5,6304331053,"""The Heroes of Telemark"" has been on my DVD wish list since the format was introduced in 1997. Long a staple on TCM, for some inexplicable reason the movie has remained unavailable on DVD in the US until now.

The 1965 WWII movie features Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris and Ulla Jacobsson as members of the Norwegian resistance in German occupied Norway. Their mission is to prevent the German's from acquiring enough heavy water to produce an atomic bomb.

Loosely based on what is considered the most successful commando raid in Europe during WWII, the movie also features Anton Diffring as Nazi Major Frick. Kirk Douglas is terrific as Oslo University Professor Rolf Pedersen in a near prototype performance for Indiana Jones. Richard Harris is also good as resistance fighter Knut Straud.

Fans of the score for ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" will recognize elements of that score in ""The Heroes of Telemark,"" both by Malcolm Arnold, which can feel distracting at times because of their similarities. The movie is filled with suspense, several very good action set pieces and is notable as the final movie completed by the great director Anthony Mann.

The DVD transfer by Sony is adequate and watchable, but there are no extras on the disc. Not even the trailer. This is a movie that would have been even better with an audio commentary and documentary by Anthony Mann scholars as well as WWII historians knowledgeable on the events depicted in the movie.",1302912000,8,1454,4.8983739837398375

As with the chinese import both DVD's have subtitles (as does Night of the Generals) so if your as big a fan of this film as I am, it is worth the purchase price to have an improved DVD version. The story of Commandos from Norway & Britian working together to destroy Hitler's heavy water production is heroic and based on true events.

845991,3,6304331053,"As I write this, there are two releases of this movie on DVD currently being sold on Amazon, a Region 1 import by the Studio ""Dragon Movies"", and a relatively newer Australian import (Region 4) by the Studio ""Magna Pacific"" and sold by a different distributor.  The reviews here have I believe incorrectly (and perhaps unfairly) been listed under both releases; most if not all reviews shown here are for the Region 1 import and not the Australian Region 4 import.

MY review is of the Australian import.  I have not seen the other Region 1 import, but I don't think it is the same.  For one, Amazon lists the Region 1 import as having English and Chinese subtitles.  The Australian version does not have subtitles.  From what I saw in the Australian import, it doesn't seem to me as bad as the reviews here are describing.

The picture quality does appear to be that of a VHS transfer to DVD.  A bit fuzzy and muted at times like VHS, however there were no drop-outs or other defects in the picture normally associated with VHS tape. It isn't that bad and is quite watchable, it just doesn't have that DVD sharpness and clarity.

Another star is lost because it is 1:33 and not widescreen.  It starts off in widescreen in the opening credits, but then changes to 1:33, which suggests it could've been a TV broadcast captured to VHS and then transfered to DVD, but that is only speculation.

Sound volume is low and I had to turn up the TV volume higher than normal, but otherwise there were no sound problems and I could hear all dialogue and other sounds just fine.

Even though it wasn't DVD quality, having not seen this top-notch film in years it was still enjoyable for me.  Until if and when someone releases a enhanced DVD release this release is OK.  Not great, but OK.",1278979200,4,1778,4.498442367601246

846084,4,6304331053,"Anthony Mann's last completed film, The Heroes of Telemark doesn't have the kind of reputation most of his later films enjoy, yet it's still a cut above most men-on-a-mission war movies of its day. Although it creates two star parts for Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, his spectacular account of the Norwegian resistance's attempts to destroy the Nazis supply of heavy water doesn't deviate quite as much from the facts as most `true' WW2 stories and is often more interested in the moral implications of how many innocent civilians you can  `allow' to be killed to prevent the Nazis from getting their hands on the atom bomb than it is in the big explosions. Uncredited script doctor Harold Pinter's rewrite also adds some sexual politics as reluctantly recruited playboy scientist Douglas and boy scout resistance leader Harris (in one of his few 60s films where he's not wearing more eyeliner than the leading lady) lock antlers over Ulla Jacobsson, but for the most part it's a well-crafted, well-cast above-average genre film, with Mann's striking composition and use of landscape (particularly his beloved high country) very much to the fore in the lengthy 18-minute raid on the heavy  water factor, played almost  entirely  in  silence.

The lead casting is rather curious if you're familiar with Mann's career - Kirk Douglas had him replaced on Spartacus and felt he owed the director a picture while Richard Harris had originally been cast as Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire only to pull out of the picture - but they work well together, and there's a strong supporting cast:  Michael Redgrave, Eric Porter hamming away shamelessly as the ruthless Nazi overseeing the project while Anton Diffring carries out his orders as usual, Roy  Dotrice as a collaborator (ironically his  skiing  double in the  film is one of  the real Norwegian saboteurs!) and a host of familiar  faces like Maurice Denham, Geoffrey Keen, Mervyn Johns and George Murcell. Robert Krasker's cinematography comes into its own in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, but unfortunately it's not well represented on the film's UK DVD releases, which overdo the edge enhancement to such a degree that some characters often have halos whenever they're in long shot  (the Norwegian DVD release has better definition but also has slightly faded color and some print damage).

On the plus side, Carlton's special edition PAL UK DVD comes with a wealth of extra features (some 70 minutes worth), including vintage black and white location reports and a slew of lengthy on-location interviews with Anthony Mann, Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Michael Redgrave & Ulla Jacobsson as well as the original theatrical trailer.",1232496000,,2701,5.09297052154195

846179,4,6304331053,"""Heroes of Telemark"" is loosely based on the World War II efforts by the Norwegian Resistance to prevent Nazi occupation forces from moving materials crucial to the development of an atomic bomb out of Norway.

The movie opens with the escape from Norway by sea of a group of resistance fighters (led by actor Richard Harris).  Among the passengers is a professor from Oslo (played with characteristic me-first bravado by Kirk Douglas).  The leading resistance fighter and the professor are persuaded to return to Norway to combat the Nazi procurement of heavy water, a by-product of a power plant in the Telemark region but vital to producing an atomic bomb.

The two men return to Norway, reconnoiter the facility, and plan and execute an attack in mid-winter.  Their subsequent escape across the wilds of central Norway, closely pursued by the Nazis and their turncoat allies, is a dramatic highpoint of the movie.

The attack cripples the facility, but unfortunately, the Germans salvage stores of the heavy water and make plans to ship it out of Telemark by the same ferry used by the Norwegian civilian facility workers.  The ""heroes of Telemark"" must plan one final mission, one that puts their fellow Norwegians gravely at risk.

The movie is notable for having been filmed on location in Norway, and for highlighting the exceptional risks run by the Norwegian resistance, and Norwegian civilians, in a country occupied by a large and ruthless Nazi force.  It is recommended as an entertaining dramatization of a real life success in the war against the Nazis.",1175990400,,1568,5.0
