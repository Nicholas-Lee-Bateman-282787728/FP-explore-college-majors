750041,5,6303946887,"I was searching for a good film to show my Spanish 1 class as a reward for their hard work throughout the year.  I didn't want to show ""Selena"" or ""Stand and Deliver"" because a lot of the students had already seen them.  Fortunately, I stumbled across ""A Million to Juan"" and tried it.  After watching it to make sure it was school-appropriate, I knew I had picked a winner.  The plot was interesting, the characters engaging, and the message hopeful.  I highly recommend the film for anybody.  There are a couple of racy comments at the beginning, but, overall, ""A Million to Juan"" is a good family film.",1181174400,6,605,4.504587155963303
750042,5,6303946887,"Personally, I enjoy this film whenever I see it that I bought a copy for myself. It has an unlikely twist. You have this Hispanic widower(Rodriguez) raising his son with his brothers,battling dirty landlords,immigration issues,stereotypes,and the whole nine yards. He runs into a guy who hands him a check and the story runs from there. why I consider it a beautiful love story is due to the underplot with Juan and the Immigration lady(Polly Draper). Why I love it so much is because despite the stuff that Juan went through, he always had a dream, and he kept his head up no matter what. And he was a good father for his son. I just happened to catch this movie on cable some years back, and I became hooked. Hope you will too.",1031616000,13,729,4.488721804511278
750043,5,6303946887,i ran into this movie one day in 1995 at the video store well luckilly i rented it. i love it.,1028505600,,94,3.5238095238095237
750044,5,6303946887,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago, and loved it from the start. I forgot about it until I was checking out movies and all and start to looking for it. But if you ever felt like giving up, and you need a serious boost, well, this is the movie to see. here you have this man who was born in this country, but had no proof, then he lived in this slum of an apartment, worked as best as he could, and he gets a windfall of a million dollars that he had to give back after thirty days. It caused poor Juan problems  upon problems, but in the end, he really triumphs. See, I always feel that we always will have obstacles, but what we do with them is the key. Now, as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best films ever made. but, it probably wasn't so popular because it didn't hold the interest with sex,drugs,violence. But, this movie is a gem. many kudos to Paul Rogriguez and cast for this film.",1002672000,6,904,4.022222222222222
750045,5,6303946887,"I saw a Million to Juan, and I thought it was one of the most sweetest films I have ever seen.

750200,1,6303946887,"It is a sweet, kind movie. Yes, it is touching. But it's also very hammy, full of caricatures and cliches in developing anything. As a result, it's very awkward and clumsy to watch. The only character that bears any credibility is Polly Draper's. She perfect for her role. Lovely, and a real pleasure to watch. But every moment away from her is too stereotypical to be taken serious, from Juan's pleading little boy, to Larry Linville giddy banker. This movie was actually a little embarrassing, to me at least. Here's the funny part: it's one of those so bad, I've watched it more than once. So to it's credit, this movie does have its appeal to certain audiences. This much I will say definitively: this is one of the worst movie title's of all time.",1379980800,,752,4.5777777777777775

750203,5,6303946887,"When my boyfriend and I watched this movie years ago it kept our interest. The movie touches on many social topics such as family bonding, death, and immigration, but to have one stand the test of time through chance is hardly something the general population can experience. Not every person on Earth is ""in the right place at the right time"" to experience receiving a million dollars from a stranger and have the emotional and mental preparations to make the moral choices of what to do with the money. However, this is a feel good movie as Juan (Rodriguez) prevailed by keeping his feet on the ground, maintaining single-parenthood, and getting the girl (Draper).",1351555200,,666,4.850877192982456

750206,5,6303946887,"Loosely based on a short story by Mark Twain called ""The 10,000 Pound Note"", ""A Million to Juan"" is updated for the 90's and set in East LA.  Paul Rodriquez stars as a single father who is given a million dollar check by a mysterious stranger with the stipulation that the check be returned.  So what good is it?  You'd be suprised! Employing a mostly Latino cast including Edward James Almos, Tony Plana, and Gerardo Mejia, Rodriguez explores a gentle, often comical and sometimes heartbreaking side to life that is mostly overlooked in today's films.

In today's environment of ""gritty"", honest and mostly violent films, A Million To Juan"" should be treasured, and not to be missed. Be sure to catch Cheech Marin's cameo as ""Shell Shock"".",1215820800,,740,4.803149606299213
750207,5,6303946887,"A great comedy-rags to riches-romantic movie for the whole family to see.  It's about Juan (played by Paul Rodriguez) who is given a million dollars by a mysterious stranger (Edward James Olmos) to use for 30 days.  Meanwhile, Olivia (played by Polly Draper)is trying to obtain a green card for him, and his landlord (Paul Williams) is making life miserable for him, his family, and his friends.  What takes place in between all that is what makes it worth watching.",1184544000,,466,4.8
750208,3,6303946887,"This is the story of a mexican american that can't prove his birth in the US, therefore, is treated like an illegal alien (that would never happen, would it?)  Some non-latinos may say that the white people in the movie may be unfairly stereotyped as racist or that the hispanics may be unfairly stereotyped, unless you have a million dollars!  But is it stereotying, or is it a reflection of reality? Watch the movie and you decide!

There are cameo appearances by Cheech Marin and a small, but important part played by Edward James Olmos.  The leading lady is a babe, but I have never seen her in any other movies.",1183593600,,616,4.5225225225225225

7858072,5,6303946887,"It's not your normal comedy that you would expect from Paul Rodriguez. There are some funny points but it is more of a story about a single father trying to make a good life for his son when an angel/man appears out of nowhere and gives Juan a large check to hold onto for a month. He can't cash it and has to return it at the end of 30 days but when he shows banks and businesses the check doors open for him that wouldn't before. Very nice story showing how you can lose yourself in money, hit bottom and then rise up agian.",1471910400,,526,4.019047619047619
