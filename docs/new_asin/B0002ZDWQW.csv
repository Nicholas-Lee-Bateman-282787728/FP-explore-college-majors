1 Raw Deal. Dennis OKeefe is an escaped con with two women in his life,nice gal(Marsha Hunt)and not so nice(Claire Trevor)
Dennis is being doublecrossed by his exboss,Rick Coil(Raymond Burr)who puts his killer henchman(John Ireland)on his trail.
Keep an eye out for Ray Teal(Bit)
2TMen The Treasury Dept VS The Mob. Two undercover agents,Dennis OKeefe and Alfred Ryder get inside the mob to smash a counterfeit gang flooding the Country with bad money. Charles McGraw is a standout as brutal gangster,Moxie.
Keep an eye out for June Lockhart(Lassie TV Series)Bit.",1323302400,,762,5.0078740157480315
8035248,4,B0002ZDWQW,"In RAW DEAL fall guy, Dennis O'Keefe is a wanted man: wanted by a blonde (Claire Trevor complete with voice over), a brunette (the luscious Marsha Hunt), a VERY big bad guy (Raymond Burr) who likes to torture using lots of heat - a cigarette lighter, a pot of boiling coffee, anything hot and handy will do really.  But if that is not enough, O'Keefe is also wanted by the entire police forces of four states! Like all good noir he gets it in the guts but he leaves a few bodies behind and two mourning women. With dialogue up to scratch, terrific acting, ok music and some brilliant photography - lovers of close ups ahoy! - this is one noir to own. PLUS a second movie by the director, not quite as good, but better than most.",1124928000,4,728,4.27536231884058
8035249,5,B0002ZDWQW,"I agree with others in that these are both outstanding films. Absolutely terrific. Anyone who has a basic understanding of Noir recognizes Anthony Mann's talent. ""He Walks By Night"" is also excellent, but AM is uncredited as the director, even though he worked on it and his influence is obvious.",1109203200,3,296,4.94
8035250,5,B0002ZDWQW,"With this well-priced 2-disc edition you get the 1947 classic ""T-Men"" as well as the 1948 classic ""Raw Deal"". These are easily the two best examples of low-budget film noir directed by Anthony Mann. ""Raw Deal"" stars Dennis O'Keefe, Claire Trevor, John Ireland, Marsha Hunt, and a wonderfully evil Raymond Burr! Dennis O'Keefe stars as a gangster seeking revenge on Raymond Burr, the mobster who double-crossed him and had him framed. Claire Trevor plays O'Keefe's girlfriend, but when the pair kidnap an attractive young woman (Marsha Hunt), it quickly turns into a love triangle! Both women want O'Keefe, but he's determined to have his revenge, leading to tragic consequences. ""Raw Deal"" has incredible cinemaography, an awesome cast, and great dialogue.

""T-Men"" stars Dennis O'Keefe, Mary Meade, Alfred Ryder, Wally Ford, and June Lockhart, and is a tough-as-nails story about two U.S. Treasury agents (Dennis O'Keefe & Alfred Ryder) that go undercover in order to bust a huge counterfeiting ring that has already killed one T-Man. Despite the film's corny beginning and narration, the movie is very suspenseful towards the end, especially when the leader of the counterfeit ring becomes increasingly suspicious of the two agents, who pose as crooks. Both of these are undeniably classics of the film noir genre, and thankfully the picture quality is very good. Also the bonus features include the original trailers as well as two documentaries narrated by Max Allan Collins. If you enjoy classic crime dramas then this belongs in your dvd library!",1102982400,10,1552,5.232931726907631

I went to ""vcientertainment dot com"" and I was able to see a picture of the cover and asertain which movies are in this set...""T-MEN"" & ""RAW DEAL""....Both on their own a great film noir standards...I Hope this helps..",1101945600,8,331,4.516666666666667
