8388529,1,B0034SP1VI,"Noel's family has fallen into darkness. Dad is a drunk and is divorced. Her brother has a trashy sleep over gf. Her sister smokes pot and has sex with strangers, and mom is going out to get drunk and pick up men. Mom tosses away Noel's toy dragon she got at the mall...ready...because it invites in demons.

Yes a demon does show up.

I did like the make-up on the demons. The rest of the movie was bad. The sound was very bad. You could hear the people on the left side of the screen clearly while the right side was muddled. The acting was about as good as the bad script would allow. The plot? It seems to blend New Age religion with Christianity which the box calls ""Gnostic.""

F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1317081600,4,705,4.246268656716418
