The Horror Network is a fun little horror anthology treat, and really tacks on the weight and dread through each story. Each filmmaker brought something new and different to each segment.

Pros: High production value, cinematography, acting, and filming locations.

Cons: None. I honestly had no problems with this horror anthology what so ever!

7307639,5,B010CG2F3G,"I love a lot of horror anthology horror films and this one has to the best one since ""Trick r Treat"" (2007 or 2009). I've never been a fan of the ""V.H.S."" franchise and I couldn't finish ""ABC's of Death.
""The Horror Network Vol. 1"" surrounds five stories from a variety of different directors from different countries. One of the things I love about this anthology film is how every director was able to portray how they saw what true horror was through their stories. Some stories with deal with the horror that we see in our minds like ""Merry Little Christmas"" while some stories deal with deranged murders like ""The Deviant One"".
My favorite stories have to be ""Edward"", ""The Quiet One"", and ""The Deviant One"". I loved those three the most. All three had great suspense, great thrills, and great twists. ""3:00 AM"" and ""Merry Little Christmas"" are my least favorites"" ""3:00 AM"" was a good opener,but not as strong as some of the other stories; however, it doesn't have great suspense in it. ""Merry Little Christmas"" has great visuals and disturbing images that creep me out,but the story seems to everywhere in this short and doesn't hold up as strong compared to it's visuals and suspenseful/disturbing images.
Overall, I give this movie anthology a 5 out of 5 because it's nice to finally see a horror anthology film that I love after the crap that has come out the past few years. I highly recommend this film and it goes nicely in my collection with my other favorite anthology films.",1447718400,7,1490,4.669201520912548
7307640,4,B010CG2F3G,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I love, love, LOVE horror movie anthologies!  Seems like the more I watch, the more I love em.  Just like with short horror stories in literature, creating an effective short horror film is a true work of art; its certainly not something just anybody can do.  It takes talent and skill.  THE HORROR NETWORK, VOLUME 1 is rife with both, and the result is an excellent collection of horror shorts that fans of the genre will love.

I think what I love most about this anthology is the diversity of the films.  Theres a little bit of everything in here, from supernatural scares to serial killers.  Chances are, if you give this collection a shot, youll find something you like.

Each film in THE HORROR NETWORK, VOLUME 1 is shot well and looks good onscreen.  A couple, specifically The Quiet and Merry Little Christmas, are more vibrant than the others in their look and feel.  But the sound quality in 3:00 AM is the best out of the bunch by far.

The acting is nice as well.  I didn't recognize a single actor or actress, however that means nothing because the quality of the performances is top notch regardless.  The entire cast does a great job with their roles, and Ill wager we will be seeing more than just a few of the faces in this crowd.

THE HORROR NETWORK, VOLUME 1 is a big win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The production quality is great, the stories are intense and intriguing, and the directorial styles are all refreshing.  You just cant ask for much more out of an anthology.  THE HORROR NETWORK, VOLUME 1 is available nowbut I cant wait to see what Volume 2 will offer.",1447632000,4,1668,4.430921052631579

7307642,1,B010CG2F3G,"Wow. I bought into the big review here, and I can now only think it was written by the producer. This low budget collection of horror tales was, for me, xompletely without any scares or thrills (from jump scares to slow builds... nothing). I was hoping for some kind of deep psychological horror, given the directors referenced in the marketing materials are quite good at slow build horror with in-depth character studies... This, however, is just a rushed-through time-waster that leans heavily on its source material, while not adding anything to the original. Low budget indie horror is my fav genre, and this is just an example of a good idea poorly executed. How the reviewer was so completely blown away by this video is difficult to fathom. But, I fell for it.

I do think the DVD artwork is cool, and that, too, sold me on renting this thing.

Ugh - waste of time and money.",1447286400,4,883,4.617834394904459
7307643,4,B010CG2F3G,"This is absolutely bloody brilliant. I am utterly shocked at how great this is. This is a modern day Horror anthology that becomes an instant classic that does not hide behind the mundane, clichd reality of a lot of these, style of horror films. This is a five part film. Five stories to complete the film.

All five stories add a mix of storytelling with the deranged, and violent reality of horror. Of the five stories, 3 really stand out as being brilliant, disturbing and downright creepy. My personal 3 favorites, and the strongest of the batch of horror stories is, 3am, Edward, Merry Little Christmas.

This is being brought out on DVD by the wonderful company Wild Eye Releasing. Wild Eye Releasing is a diverse company that releases independent horror films of all styles of horror. This is another prime example of their expertise in choosing lasting examples of horror no matter how low budget, or high budget they may be.

The Horror Network is a modern horror that finally takes a serious approach to the world of horror. There is no added humor that so many horror movies this day and age feel they have to add. This film is a strong dose of originality, and a disturbing brilliance of twisted insanity that finally delves deep into the aspects of classic horror, fear, disturbing creepy noises, unspeakable acts of depravity, and a wholly original conclusion.

3:00 AM. A woman receives a mysterious call at 3am every morning. Her home makes noises. Her surroundings play with her mind as objects move, and noises penetrate her peaceful world. This creates an old school attempt at loud noises, creepy sounds, moments of fear. The disturbing nature of a woman alone in a house, when something mysterious is going on, gives a classic approach to fear, dread, and just what is happening. The sound effects in this story are brilliant, and downright creepy.

Edward. This is my favorite, and one the best Horror skits I have seen in a very long time. A young man is seeing a therapist. He has problems. He don't want to sleep because of the dreams. He sleep walks. He awakes in places. His mind is slowly playing tricks on him. I am impressed beyond words with the acting of Nick Frangione as the character Hal. He is utterly flooring in this twisted, deranged story of inner personalities, and the aspect of evil. Alongside him is actor Artem Mishin who equally gives a brilliant performance. Edward is one of the best short films, skits I have ever seen. Pure horror excellence. Flawless acting. Amazing direction and execution of a twisted originality. This story needs to be seen. The effects, makeup stand out in great horror inducing details that this movie lover really enjoyed.

The Quite One. A deaf girl walks home from her school bus stop. Soon she notices a blue van which seems to be following her. Unique blend of old school. A girl, alone, the woods, being stalked. A simple story that leads to a twisted truth in the end. A gloomy and dark reality.

Merry Little Christmas. This ties with Edward as being one the best horror skits I have seen in a long time. A mother and daughter stained by an act of violence. The daughter relives the act over and over, as her life is clouded with images of witnessing her mother brutally attacked and rapped. This is one of the vilest, and disturbing skits I have ever seen. This is a bloody, gory, and a visionary step into a wholly disturbing violent reality. This utterly left me dumbfounded. There are moments of extreme violence that will shock even the most hardened horror fan. The makeup, and gore is beyond words. This is one of the most brilliant examples of makeup in the modern world of film making that I have come across. No CGI, just wonderful makeup, and effects, created by the hands of artist. There are moments in this that utterly left me in shocking disbelief at what I just saw. There is also a unique blend of artistry in this skit. The imagery is flooring, and something that leaves a brutal memory with you.

The Deviant One. A man passing judgement in the vilest way. This is basically a serial killer short film. This displays itself with a surreal approach to the subject. This also is an added bonus in the special features department, you get an Extended Cut of this skit. The skit in the film wraps up the movie. I do feel this eaves a disturbing insanity to the conclusion of the film.

You the viewer enter into the recesses of darkness, from the human side to the evil side. From mans evil, to demonic evil. The Horror Network is one of the most brilliant horror films I have seen in a long time. It deserves to be seen.

These five stories directed by 4 brilliant imaginative, and very gifted directors. The strongest skit is Edward and Merry Little Christmas. All five skits are memorable, and stand out as truly original concepts that bleed horror, and originality in storytelling.

This horror anthology is highly recommended by A Bucket of Corn. Wild Eye Releasing has brought out an excellent example of high class horror that the world of horror films need.

First story seems to be about a woman who's afraid of every noise in her house: oooo, scary. 2nd story has a little more going for it but the pacing could have been better. 3rd story is a waste of time. 4th and 5th stories were the best of the lot. Worth a look if you can see it for free. Note: the cover illustration is actually from 15-20 seconds of the 4th segment, so don't let the box cover influence you!",1470960000,3,485,4.170212765957447
7307651,2,B010CG2F3G,"This is an film of 5 shorts, most are boring with attempts at the expected twist. One concerns a haunted house and phone call. There is a man talking to a psychologist. A lost deaf girl. The best graphic one had subtitles and a confusing Christmas tale. And the last one was black and white gay snuff porn.

It was an attempt at being clever, although I felt it fell short.

7307653,1,B010CG2F3G,"I was looking at this title months before it came out on the pre-order section. When it saw it being compared with Tales From The Crypt , Tales From The Darkside , and Creepshow I knew I had to buy it. Most of the anthology horror movies I've ever seen have been great, it's always seemed to me that the majority of people that will make a movie of short horror storys or short weird storys put enough time/thought/love into the writing and making of them to do a good job.

But this one disappoints. Not one of the tales in this movie is cool.

 I would rather get my arm stuck in one of those crane games where you attempt to win a stuffed animal or prize and then after realizing no one is coming to help me get out of my predicament, slowly gnaw my arm off to get free THAN watch this again.

I tried selling this at a garage sale and no one would even buy it for a dollar, Ha Ha !!!",1468627200,2,887,3.994350282485876
7307654,4,B010CG2F3G,"This was an interesting horror anthology. Out of the Five Tales there were Two that got under my skin.those being ""Merry Little Christmas and ""The Deviant One"".

""Merry Little Christmas"" was very brutal and had scenes of rape and severe bloody violence. I found it to be somewhat ambiguous but was very intrigued by the story of domestic abuse and what makes a monster a monster and how that monster can take over your life.

""The Deviant One"" was insanely perverted and they hold nothing back showing some very sick and twisted necrophelia .There was a scene that reminded me of a scene in (High Tension) and that scene always creeper me  out!

The other stories weren't bad, just nothing memorable, although the acting in a couple of them is so good you stay meserized even with little pay off. All in all I give it a thumbs up.",1465344000,3,830,4.550335570469799

8722021,3,B010CG2F3G,"It was so difficult to choose either 2 or 3 stars for this review but I feel it's much more of an ""it's okay"" than ""I don't like it"", and on a scale of 10 for horror movies I would give it a 4/10.  My biggest complaints come about with the audio and visual quality of most of the shorts in general in this collection.  Up until the final one or two it looks as if they were all filmed in the late 80's or early 90's based on video quality.

I can't recall the total number of short films in this movie I'm thinking maybe 7 of them.  Two of them I thought were great, another I liked, another had some great visual effects and the rest I didn't hate I would just say I didn't care for them.

The opening short is great even with the bad audio that another reviewer pointed out, but all of the elements of a good horror film where there.  Also the final one is really something to see, disturbing, and realistic in it's simplicity.  Yes the first and last short are my two favorites.  The 2nd to last has some really messed up visuals dealing with brutal domestic violence, but the ""Hellraiser"" like sequence as noted in the cover art for this short showcases some pretty cool effects.  The other one that I liked was def school girl.

If you liked ABC's of Death you'll probably like this one too.  I only say I really like it because two of the shorts (total of 10-15 minutes) of the entire movie will stay with me and I liked.  It's far from great but I really liked the first and last short.",1524009600,2,1493,4.145833333333333

8722023,2,B010CG2F3G,"I was kinda hoping for more with this movie. People were saying it was deep and interesting...it really wasn't. There's a spectrum of horror here, but the only really scary thing in it was the way they portrayed domestic violence and rape. I mean, if I want to see that kind of thing, I'd prefer it actually have some meaning to it, not just used as a trigger for ""fear"" or to make you uncomfortable. I love horror anthologies, and have seen my fair share of really really bad ones. Sadly this one can't even rank up with them because it tried too hard to be serious.
