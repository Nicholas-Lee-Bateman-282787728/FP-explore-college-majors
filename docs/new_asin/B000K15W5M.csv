8153919,5,B000K15W5M,"I recorded this excellent Frontline movie on a VHS tape - I was out the evening they showed it. Watching it later I found it to be the most full, detailed and objective accounting of how the Oslo Peace process unraveled, and what the key sticking points were on both sides. Because so much of U.S. media seems terminally biased pro-Israeli and anti-Palestinian (after all, they're all ""terrorists"" aren't they? - or so we're told!), this outstanding movie is a most welcome corrective to all the preconceived and erroneous interpretations we have been fed by AIPAC and the U.S. media for decades. It includes video footage of today's Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, talking directly into the camera and saying clearly he wants to unravel the Oslo Peace accords - in 1996 when he is also them PM. It shows video footage of the Likud march to the Dome of the Rock and the Israeli Jerusalem police firing live rounds - automatic weapons fire - directly into a crowd of unarmed Palestinian protesters. This atrocity launched the Second Intifada and coincidentally brought Ariel Sharon to power as prime minister in 2001. It shows the two lead negotiators - Saeb Erekat for the Palestinians, and Shlomo Bon-Ami for the Israelis - wistfully recalling right afterwards that they actually had a detailed final peace agreement - approved by both sides - that could have been adopted in 2000. This is riveting stuff! Watch it to have your misconceptions of what this terrible conflict is about corrected. I certainly did!",1390089600,,1523,4.929961089494164
