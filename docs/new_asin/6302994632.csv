7834087,5,6302994632,"Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker are comedy legends that should have been canonised. This collection of television skits and specialty movie will prove to you why.

The two deliver black humor with a bright smile. The predictability of the punchlines makes it all the funnier.

I remember By the Sea and The Picnic, being screened on television all those years ago. A recent viewing proved that it is just as strong. If boobies, bums and little men being thrown about the room are not funny, then I stand guilty of madness. If you are going to accuse me, watch this video/dvd first.  I have screened it to many and all agree that it is excellent.

I find it sad that this collection is not readily available. It show's that great comedy can be forgotten. I think we owe it to ourselves to protect and remember the great comedies of today. I am a great promoter of comedy that I love and enjoy. The Two Ronnies, Ricky Gervais's the Office, Woody Allen's Broadway Danny Rose and Simon Roptell's Garter and Quail are all fantastic comedies one should have on their mantelpiece.

The Two Ronnies: By The Sea & The Picnic are two great comedy feasts that will pick you up - no matter how down you are.",1144368000,5,1196,4.518518518518518
