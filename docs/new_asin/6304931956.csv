7884058,3,6304931956,"This is one of those Hong Kong movies that defies a five-star rating system.  On the plus side, it's got gorgeous Chingmy Yau as a nightclub mamasan, and Yau was always a better actress than people gave her credit for, as well as tremendous eye candy.  It's also got a young Shu Qi playing a massage parlour worker and giving a fat guy a vigourous hand-job. There's also some great atmospheric cinematography (I love the look of Hong Kong films of the early 90s), Elvis Tsui as a horny bodyguard who can't afford the girls in his boss's pricey nightclub, and a pretty scary turn by Simon Yam as the sort of ruthless triad kingpin who would let his teenaged girlfriend take a fall and serve jail time for him.  It even has those ridiculous mangled English subtitles of the period (e.g., ""You've misshaped by breasts!"").  For some of us, this is just about all you'll need to hear to know you're in Hong Kong movie heaven.  For the remaining, more rational segment of the population, this movie is ineptly edited and barely even makes much sense (Yam disappears for large parts of the film, supposedly on the lam in Holland!). There's a feeling like half the story ended up on the cutting room floor ... or wasn't even shot in the rush to get this one into the cinemas.  In other words, Street Angels is a joyous mess, but Chingmy Yau fans will want this one straightaway....",1231632000,4,1373,4.516129032258065

I think this is a pretty bad movie in general and it just really wasn't executed well.  The plot is based on the comic Red Light District comic with Playman Man (played by Michael Tao) vs. But Bit Wah (played by Simon Yam).  There were two hot female lead, Chimney Yao and Shi Chi but the story was poor and the entire story is rather incomplete.  This one is defn not worth the money for but if you enjoy comic intrepretation movie, you might enjoy this one.",974419200,5,564,4.2924528301886795
