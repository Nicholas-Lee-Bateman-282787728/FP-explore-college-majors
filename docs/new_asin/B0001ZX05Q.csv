2049621,3,B0001ZX05Q,"Ok, the basic plot layout is this: six unlikely friends band together to break into the Educational Testing Service (ETS) building in Princeton, NJ in order to steal the answers to the upcoming SAT's.  The plan begins with Kyle (Chris Evans) and his best friend Matty (Bryan Greenburg).  Kyle is an aspiring architect who dreams of going to Cornell University in Ithica.  He needs at least a 1430, but he got a 1020 on his first crack at the tests.  He's afraid that he's too ""average"" for the SAT.  Matty wants to go to the University of Maryland for one reason, his girlfriend Sandy goes there, and unfortunately for Matty, he's not too bright.  The duo soon realizes that a fellow classmate's father owns the ETS building, so they ask Francesca (Scarlett Johansson) to help them out.  Francesca is a rich punk girl who would love nothing more than to stick it to her father who pays more attention to his 20-year-old girlfriends than her (keep in mind that the character, and Johannson I think, are 18).  Kyle also tells Anna (Erika Christensen) about the plan because he has a ""feeling"" about her.  Francesca wonders aloud if the feeling took place near his crotch.  Anyway, Anna is number 2 in the class.  She is an overachiever who is trying hard to fulfill her parents' expectations, which include getting into Brown, although, Anna secretly has other desires.  The first time Anna took the test, she froze after reading a story problem about a woman on a subway in New York, which I found to be one of the dumbest plot points in the film.  Anyway, one day, the local basketball star, Desmond (Darius Miles, who is one of the WORST actors I have ever seen) comes to Anna for help.  He is a great ball-player, but his academics aren't quite up to par, and he needs a 900 to get into St. John's College.  Finally, a stoner (who is also a genius) named Roy (Leonard Nam) overhears Kyle and Matty talking about the plan, so he is included as well.

Each student had a reason for stealing the SAT's, and yet, each of them found a reason not to as well.  Sadly, the movie was slightly anti-climactic, but the lack of climax for the six main characters allowed for one of more funny jokes in the movie, which involved the other stoners at the school being able to get into Harvard.  SAT, according to Roy, would then stand for ""Stoned And Toasted"".

I must say, for a group of high school stereotypes, I knew a lot of them at my school.  Also, while on the surface the characters were nothing more than stereotypes, deep down, they did have other layers.  For example, Desmond did have some good math skills, Roy was a master programmer, and Francesca was pretty wise for a punk girl.  The best character by far is Roy.  He is the funniest, the smartest, and in a way, one of the wisest.  Maybe the movie carries an anti-pot message, I'm not sure.  Roy, despite being stoned most of the time, is actually able to get the gang out of a few tight spots, although, it does hinder them at times as well.

This movie did have a good share of flaws, though.  I already talked about the subway question.  Man that was a stupid, contrived, unnecessary idea.  Furthermore, I would be happy if there NEVER AGAIN was a ""Matrix"" ripoff!  I'm so sick of those.  Also, I guess they only cast Darius Miles because he could look the part of a great basketball player, because they sure didn't cast him for his acting ability!  He was monotonous and he looked very uncomfortable in the movie.

Anyway, this movie will entertain you.  It has its flaws, but when it's funny, it's really funny.  This should be a good rental.

Hey, did you notic in my title that the words begin with SAT?  Pretty cool, huh?",1092873600,,3687,4.490225563909775
2049622,4,B0001ZX05Q,"I honestly don't understand why this movie has recieved so many bad reviews. I thought this movie was one of the funniest I'd seen in a long time. Sure, it's not mature humor, but it's also not as immature as movies such as American Pie. There is a decent storyline with some pretty good acting and a number of VERY funny moments. Rent this movie first, if you like it, buy it.",1091923200,,377,4.25
2049623,1,B0001ZX05Q,"This is billed as Ocean's Eleven meets The Breakfast Club. Hardly.

It's nearly impossible to sympathize with any of the characters, as they're either written to be caricatures (the quadratic equation genius), or the actors portraying them just can't act (the basketball player).

I won't spend time tearing this down, because writing this much is really a waste - I just want others to know that this is really, really bad. The entire plot to steal the SAT scores is just ludicrous, and there are more holes in their scheme than there are in the heads of a million birdbrained idiots.

The only redeeming quality is the inclusion of Scarlett Johannsson, who seems to add light to everything she touches. She made a poor choice here - but she's made excellent choices elsewhere.

Don't waste your time with this. Pass it by.",1091491200,5,824,4.78169014084507
2049624,4,B0001ZX05Q,"This was a great movie. It had plot, it had twists (well some) and it was funny. The main comic relief was brought by the character Roy - a pot smoking, genius.
The gist of the movie goes like this...
Students from different backgrounds (the basketball star, the average joe, the 2nd in her class, etc.) join forces to steal the ansers to the SAT. Very inventive though I think I've seen this somewhere before... yes that's right... definately a mix between The Breakfast Club and Oceans Eleven. I would recomend this...",1088985600,2,520,4.663043478260869
2049625,3,B0001ZX05Q,"I enjoy the movie ""The Perfect Score"" I assumed it was a comedy but found it to be much more. Now don't get me wrong there was comedy in it and even though it had no real well known actors and actresses they were very good. I predict you and I will be seeing more of them in the future.
The reason I liked it was because you have six kids who don't seem to have much faith in themselves to make well enough scores on the dreaded SAT. They plot to steal the answers and end up becoming best friends and learning much more about them selves and what they want out of life for themselves. I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't. As the owner of well over one thousand DVD movies I think I know what people will enjoy. So for the price you can't beat it. Enjoy it, I know I did. I also very much enjoy the behind the scenes clips and the making of the movie.",1088985600,,859,3.914285714285714
2049626,4,B0001ZX05Q,"The Perfect Score is an awesome movie! I found the plot very interesting along with the well thought out variety of characters. It is easy to connect to a particular character right off the bat (let's hope its not the stoner), which provides for some personal enjoyment while watching. This is the type of movie that starts off strong by catching your interest quickly and continues to throw out puzzling dilemas while the characters are attempting the theft of the SAT scores. I thought this movie was hilarious and offered several themes, yet I think it deserves to stick at a rental store instead of in your movie collection. It seems to be a great one-time-viewing-pleasure type of movie. Thus, be sure to check out The Perfect Score some way or another and enjoy!",1088899200,,768,4.7388059701492535
2049627,4,B0001ZX05Q,"No, I do not remember my SAT score, but I have taught enough high school students terrorized by the thought of how a four digit number could totally ruin their lives (i.e., deny them the college of their dreams) to realize that this is a tender subject.  Which is why it is nice to report that ""The Perfect Score"" does take things seriously at the same time it is having fun with the paranoia.  I might not be able to answer any of the SAT questions that pop up during the movie, but I do know that the screenplay by Mark Schwahn (creator of ""One Tree Hill""), Marc Hyman  (""Osmosis Jones"") and Jon Zack (""Out Cold"") is a lot better than I would have thought for a movie like this 2004 comedy.
The story takes place in Princeton, New Jersey which is, oddly enough, where you find the Princeton Testing Center that is the home of the SAT exam (SAT stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test but one of the running gags in this film is the effort to come up with a more appropriate meaning to the anagram).  The first SAT exam of the year has come and gone and Kyle (Chris Evans) discovers his score is too low to get him into Cornell and Anna (Erika Christensen) can apparently forget about her parents' dream of Brown.  The next exam is in two weeks and since getting smarter in a fortnight is not likely, stealing the exam sounds like a good idea.  Kyle's friend Matty (Bryan Greenberg), already bound for Maryland, is willing to help and they approach Francesca (Scarlett Johansson), whose daddy happens to run PTC and can provide a way in.  The final members of the group are Desmond (Darius Miles), a basketball star whose mom wants him to go to college, and Roy (Leonardo Nam), a stoner who is involved only because he knows about what is going on.
Now, in the real world stealing one SAT exam does not do you any good because there are several versions, so the person sitting next to you can have different questions or the questions are in a different order (or both).  But that is besides the point in ""The Perfect Score"" and I ended up liking this movie a lot more than I thought I would for three reasons.  The first I cannot tell you about because it would spoil the movie, but it has to do with an interesting twist on expectations.  The second is the character of Desmond's mother (Tyra Ferrell), who has an impact on more than just her son.  This film plays a lot with the stereotypes, from class brain to dumb jock to stoner, and I like the way Desmond's mother fits into that mold as well.  The third is that this film comes up with a really, really great line about why not to be scared about the questions on the SAT, spoken, of course, by the most ironic character in the mix.
""The Perfect Score"" is an enjoyable little caper comedy that certainly exceeds expectations, which is not a bad recommendation given most teen comedies today.  The characters manage to avoid being stupid, a standard pitfall in the genre, although I suspect there are those who will be disappointed with the way things get resolved at the end.  I also think it was nice that if Scarlett Johansson could not get an Oscar nomination for either ""Lost in Translation"" or ""Girl With a PEarl Earring"" then at least she got to do a decent ""Matrix"" takeoff in this film.  Plus it was interesting to see Darius Miles who went to the pros instead of attending St. Johns University play a character who does the opposite, although it is ironic to see Mike Jarvis play himself since he had been fired from the St. Johns post by the time ""The Perfect Score"" was released.",1088467200,15,3544,4.414110429447852
2049628,4,B0001ZX05Q,"Pefect Score is a fun movie, much better than I expected. The typical high school characters are here, pot smoker, preppy girl ,jock etc...

2049668,5,B0001ZX05Q,"This movie cracks me up. It's along the same lines as Breakfast Club from the 80's where a bunch of misfits come together with a single purpose. In this case, it's the SAT's. This movie plays into every teens fear that a single test will determine their future. Why not steal the test instead of studying? There's a lot that goes into stealing the SAT, and with that premise a movie and the characters are born.

Review:

Yet another great movie with no big stars and no Hollywood fanfare.  While the main characters all seemed a little old and a little mature for high school (I would have guessed they were college-aged), performances and timing work well.  Kudos to the actor playing ""Roy"".

Anyone in high school or a family member of the same will appreciate this movie.

Yes, it's far fetched that they could steal the SAT scores...thier are multiple tests and keys, and unlike the movie protrays, they do give students many different test at each site, so the idea that getting one key for a site will give them all the correct answer is incorrect...but why tear the movie appart. Its funny, and the kids really do find out whats important in life.  Wasn't what I expected, decent film, worth checking out.",1175126400,,872,4.5
2049752,2,B0001ZX05Q,"I remember when this film came out.  I remember that because it was during the same time period where I had lots of school work to take care of.  I was studying for my mid year exams and not that long ealier, I had taken the PSAT's.  A movie this kind of plot, a bunch kids stealing test scores, definetly got my attention.  At the time, there was also another comedy in theaters-Eurotrip.  From the commercials, I thought the Perfect was going to laugh out loud funny and Eurotrip was just going to be some dumb retarded comedy.  However I did miss both films when they were in theaters but I did catch'em when they were later on tv.  Here is what's ironic-I found Eurotrip to be hilarious (and one of my favorite films today) and The Perfect score to be a complete waste of time.  Obviousely this movie was really dissapointing.

Kyle is a role model student with good grades and hopes of being an architect.  However, he finds himself having difficulty on SAT.  His friend Matty is an underachiever who would like to do well on the SAT so he can go to the same college as his girlfriend.  They both conclude that the SAT is kinda pointless (b/c it doesn't test you on how smart you are) and unfair (b/c its standing in their way)  They enlist the help of Francessca whose father owns the building of where the SATs scores are located.  Kyle also slips the plan to his crush Anna, a very intelligent student whose has some the best academic achievements in school but finds trouble with the SAT.  Anna brings in Desmond, a start basketball player who needs a 900 or better to get into college.  The last person to join the team is Roy a slacker and stoner.  With their combined brain power, the can devise a perfect plan in order to achieve the perfect and thus create a happy and bright future.

A movie with a plot like this sounds funny.  However, it ultimatley failed to deliver laughs.  The only scene I laughed at was when Kyle's brother said what his score (it was something really LOW like 125).  The movie does try to be funny but in the end, it really just tries to force the audience to laugh.  I am gonna go watch Eurotrip now.",1173916800,3,2141,4.367088607594937

2049754,3,B0001ZX05Q,"The plot of THE PERFECT SCORE is easy enough:  six very different high school students bond together to steal the answers to the SAT test the night before it is administered.  The movie takes a little while to build up and tries to be a teen version of THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.  Unfortunately, the people who originally came to see this film (and the ones whom MTV marketed it to) weren't really coming to watch a movie; they were coming to see the people who were starring in the movie.  The girls wanted to see Chris Evans, Bryan Greenberg, and basketball player Darius Miles while the guys came to see Erika Christensen and Scarlett Johansson.  Therefore, though the movie has an interesting set-up, it never really delivers and ends up being just another teen movie that most people will forget fifteen minutes after watching it.  I enjoyed watching the movie, but outside of the people who star in it, there's nothing outstanding about it.",1158105600,3,964,4.77710843373494
2049755,4,B0001ZX05Q,"The film is all about the SATs and I'm surprised that ETS allowed them to make it.  Certainly it makes ETS look like a company with a bunch of nitwits running it, and in addition shows that they have lousy security and any bunch of six random idiot teens could break in and get all of the answers to any particular SAT exam.  Was product placement so important to ETS that they let the filmmakers run down their whole organization in this way?  This is not even to mention the gfeneralized, pervasive indictment of the whole SAT system that the Scarlett Johansson character, Francesca, spouts throughout the whole movie and which is, indeed, the movie's most interesting selling point.  It's like the FAHRENHEIT 911 of standardized testing.

Otherwise it falls into a slavish imitation of THE BREAKFAST CLUB, with a bit of HARRY AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE thrown in, redeemed by the presence of the divine Chris Evans, who makes every movie he's in an overwhelming visual and sensory experience, as though Aldous Huxley had released some pleasure-inducing ""soma"" gas into the ventilation system of the theater you're watching him in.  Is he a real person, or actually a god come to earth to provide nirvana to the millions?  Here he plays ""Kyle,"" sort of a switch up for Chris in a way, as the thoughtful would-be architect who can't get good enough SAT scores to get himself into Cornell.  (""Cornell University,"" the guidance counselor adds, just in case we were thinking it was Cornell Community College Kyle was aiming for.)

Chris has played characters called Jake, Adam, Ben, Bryan AND Ryan, Seth, Bryce and Johnny Storm, but Kyle is one of his best parts yet.  A row of perfection, like clay ducks in a shooting gallery, each identical, all of them ideal.",1154390400,6,1763,4.750819672131148
2049756,2,B0001ZX05Q,"Six high school students plan to steal the answers to the upcoming SAT tests. This idea surely sounds interesting, and so are the names of the actors involved here, especially when Scarlett Johansson is among them. However, director's awfully trite, mediocre treatment completely ruined the central idea, and even Johansson, talented as she is, does not look like the same player you have seen in other better films that made her name famous.

Actually Ms. Johansson, who looks nice as a punk girl Francesca, might be the only reason for you to watch the dull and unfunny film (though she is not top-billed). The six characters we see in `The Perfect Score' are just the six stereotypes we find in high school dramas - Chris Evan's character Kyle wants to be an architect and he has a best friend Matty (Bryan Greenberg). Yes, that sort of things, so you also see a stoner Roy (Leonardo Nam) who can be a brilliant genius when he wants to, and a nice Afro-American guy Desmond who wants to be a professional basket player. And meet Ms. Christensen's dead serious character whose mother is terribly obsessed with education. Finally cameo Matthew Lilard pops up as a concerned brother to one of them, playing the guitar, doing jam session with a hair dryer.

The actors are doing their best, but with this weak script, whose story is deprived of its possibly edgy aspects, they can do nothing but repeating the tricks other actors had done in the high school comedies in the past. Everything looks like coming from some stock footage, and director Brian Robbins seems satisfied with this mildly entertaining portraits.

As to the students' heist plans, it must be said that it is too perfunctory that even with the suspense of disbelief, it never interests and convinces us. At the end credit the film makes it clear that the people at ETS (responsible for the SAT tests) didn't participate in the making of the film. Maybe they should have, and told the filmmakers how they guard information about the tests or the files in their building. The six students can break into the building so easily, as if watered-down version of `Mission Impossible,' that watching them sneak into the institute is no fun at all.

And the film has virtually nothing else to show us. The film is mildly amusing all through, and that's all I can say with confidence. `The Perfect Score' is so afraid of offending us with the initial concept, and you can feel it pulling punches.",1150070400,3,2455,4.742388758782202
2049757,4,B0001ZX05Q,"I'm glad I didn't listen to any negative comments about this movie. It's not that The Perfect Score is the best movie ever, but it makes for an entertaining hour and a half or so. It reminded me of a combination of the movies Dead Man on Campus (another fun, fun movie that I'd absolutely recommend), a little bit of Breakfast Club and a little bit of Sixteen Candles as the Asian kid reminded me a lot of Long Duck Dong. If you liked any of the movies I just mentioned, then you should give The Perfect Score a chance. If you've read about the plot and it sounds up your alley, give this movie a try. It's only $5.50 at Wal-Mart right now and you can't beat a price like that on something you'll likely watch over and over again. Not an A+ but certainly a solid B to B+ from me. Happy viewing!",1138579200,2,794,4.129032258064516
2049758,4,B0001ZX05Q,"The Perfect Score isn't the smartest film around. Nor is it the dumbest. On a bell curve, it would be graded slightly above average.

To be perfectly honest, my wife and I liked The Perfect Score better than the other, far more highly rated, Scarlett Johansson movie Ghost World. Now, *that* movie was a steaming pile. Yet, it's considered quite good by critics and viewers alike. Go figure.

The Perfect Score is a more entertaining movie than Ghost World. The ensemble cast offers enough humor to keep the plot moving and the movie interesting. No, it's not the The Breakfast Club. But, frankly, The Breakfast Club isn't The Breakfast Club the way most of us remember it, anyway. That movie doesn't really hold up some 20 years on and, in fact, looks about as goofy as The Perfect Score in plot and execution. Actually, there were a few moments of genuine hilarity and near brilliance in The Perfect Score.

Scarlett sizzles as usual. She's a hottie with a lot of talent -- quite a rarity in Hollywood these days, where hotties rule whether they're talented or not.

But the other actors turned in nice performances, too.

I disagree with the Amazon editorial reviewer who wrote, ""Still, only [Leonardo] Nam and Johansson (who, after Ghost World, Lost in Translation, and Girl with a Pearl Earring, is becoming a true movie star) stand out of the bland pack.""

We thought the acting was pretty good from all performers, even NBA player Darius Miles who was wooden and somewhat disengaged, but no more so than Keanu Reeves -- and look where Reeves is these days: an A-list powerhouse.

The plot is thin. The entire movie is fluff. But it's well-made, entertaining fluff. In Scarlett's canon of movies, I'd rank this one ahead of a few others. It's worth watching and, I think, will keep you at least chuckling to the end.

Recommended.",1136678400,6,1836,4.733542319749216
2049759,2,B0001ZX05Q,"Apparently the producers of this mess started with a weak screenplay for a genre bridging ""teen drama"" and ""big-time heist"" picture.  That they actually got a green-light for the project is amazing because the serious scenes manage to be hopelessly lame while falling short of being camp.  As the director began to actually visualize the product he panicked (with good reason) and began to add every hook he could to lure viewers (insert basketball star Darius Miles as a .......""basketball star"") including comedy and sexploitation.  Which was probably a good thing but is so poorly integrated into the story line that its commercial purpose is obvious.  Had they gone the full teen comedy route and made the serious scenes slightly more moronic they might have had a fairly entertaining satire of both genres.

Leonardo Nam was added to the cast for comic relief.  He plays an Asian version of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High's""  Jeff Spacoli.  But you have to watch his character closely because there is a lot of subtle physical humor going on that apparently escaped the notice of the director, who failed to emphasize it with close reaction shots-but it is there if you look closely at him in the wide shots.

The obvious comparison is with ""Catch That Kid"", to which ""The Perfect Score"" finishes a poor second.  While that movie had an even less credible premise, the younger actors in it had a lot more charm than this group of overage teenagers.

Sexploitation note:  The sexploitation is confined to the Scarlett Johansson character who does a nice reprise of a ""Matrix"" scene along with a few other more subtle but enjoyable bits.  Johansson actually made this movie just before she started work on ""Lost in Translation"" which helps explain why she consented to appear in this bomb.  She gets to play a rather intimidating character which was probably fun.  Fans of Erika Christensen will find nothing here other than puzzlement that she could look this drab and de-tuned.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1126742400,2,2028,4.868804664723032
2049760,4,B0001ZX05Q,"Like many I'm sure, I rented this only because Scarlet is in it. I expected a horrible movie, but really it wasn't too bad. Moved along nice. Funny in spots. You got your stressed out students, their goofy plans to steal the SAT scores, and of course you know it's a Hollywood feel-good teen movie, so you know in the end they aren't really gonna USE those scores. That'd make 'em bad, huh? Bad bad bad. ;) But still, it was better than expected and I never once had my finger hovering over the stop button.",1111449600,3,507,4.291666666666667
2049761,4,B0001ZX05Q,"I am a Scarlett Johansson fan and that is why I bought the movie and she did not disappoint me. This is much better than her performance in the Spider thriller/comedy movie. But this movie suffers from a script that was not thought all the way though and it needed more work on it before they went to production. Still, this is one of the first movies where Scarlett starts to show herself as a superstar. In fact she actually does a little bit of acting, rather then to just have that reflective lost in translation look on her face.",1110672000,11,534,4.35
2049762,5,B0001ZX05Q,"The Perfect Score is another movie in the line of Mtv's attempt at movie making. It's a nonsensical look at the bitter fact that the SAT just plain sucks. With various up and coming actors (Evans, Greenburg [from the widely popular One Tree Hill tv series], Johanssen, and Nam) plus one NBA star (no idea why), the movie's premise is that a group of score challenged high schoolers are going to steal the answers to the SAT.

This movie is worthy of five stars to for several reasons. Not one of which would be the actual story line, but the simplistic and appropriated humor. Greenburg (the reason i rented the movie) has a very funny speech about how the SAT doesn't fight fair after he is conviced the SAT is ""pimping out"" his girlfriend. Unforgetable is how Nam's character Roy refers to himself as the ghost. He delivers a very humorous performance with a very insightful line about the SAT. All the acronyms for SAT in the film are choice and the script flows well even though it is driven by a very farcical plot. Ryan Phillip also plays a small role as Kyle's (Chris Evan) brother who lives in the families garage. The film is a delight to watch with the excellent charater interaction and nice twist ending. Definately see this movie to get over your SAT anxiety, or just for a nice retreat from all the bland movies out there.",1109721600,4,1336,4.520661157024794

2049764,5,B0001ZX05Q,"The Perfect Score is a new kind of movie about a group of different teens out to steal or ""borrow"" the answers to the S.A.T., each for a different reason.

2049765,3,B0001ZX05Q,"""Ocean's eleven meets The breakfast club""...sounds pretty good to me. But although the idea sounds good, the performance is not.

Six stereotypes (the jock, the pot-head, the rebel, the pretty girl, the nice guy and average Joe) meet and unite for a common purpose, to steal the answers to the upcoming, and for them all, rather important SAT. This movie could be a waring about just that, the standardization of high-school kids, but it fails tremendously because the movie itself is standard. We have seen these characters in a dozen other teenage movies, and most of those movies have been far better. The character-growth is predictable and so is the dialogue and plot. Not even a brilliant actress like Johansen is able to lift this movie to greater heights.

So is there any point in watching The perfect score? No, there is not. But is that always the point? This movie is quite alright for watching when you don't have the energy for anything ""heavy"". It won't stay on your mind for the next couple of weeks, but it will give you 90 minutes of light entertainment.",1099440000,,1072,4.7272727272727275
2049766,5,B0001ZX05Q,The Perfect Score is a good movie. It is about a bunch of high school people who want to steel the answers to the SAT test. Its kind of like Oceans Eleven. If you liked Oceans Eleven you should watch The Perfect Score.,1097280000,,218,4.093023255813954
2049767,3,B0001ZX05Q,"There's lots of cliches and stereotypes to endure when watching a high school movie. For the most of it, The Perfect Score manages to avoid most of these cliches though the characters are a bit stereotypical. There's the brainy kid, the rebel, the stoner, the loser, the jock and the good guy. Hardly a breathtaking assortment of originals eh?

But their plan to steal the SAT scores and their interaction together are what make this movie worthwhile. The unimaginative marketing for this movie claims it to be Ocean's 11 meets The Breakfast Club. But the actors are carrying the movie, doing the best they can with weak material, rather than the `wild' premise.

I especially liked Roy, the stoner and narrator as he got the most back story and had more a character arc than the rest of them. And it was pleasant to have the lovely, oh-so-cute Erika Christensen though I'm not too fussed about Scarlett Johansen (she looks like a teenage version of my mother!). A non-Shaggy, but still manic, Matthew Lillard has a small role as a concerned big brother.

You'll not remember it 5 minutes after the credits role but for a non-threatening, easy-going movie The Perfect Score fits nicely. You could do a helluva lot worse. And what else do you expect from an MTV movie?

The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with lacklustre Dolby 5.1, though to be fair it mostly a dialogue-driven movie. There are a bunch of fluff features for those who care.",1094860800,5,1447,4.73015873015873

It is not funny.  It is not entertaining.  It is, however, a good way to waste 90 minutes of life with zero fulfilmment.  Not even Chris Evans and Erika Christensen, the ""beauties"" of the movie, could save this horrible script.  No wonder this made it to rental shelves faster than Godzilla did!

The movie was so funny! She saw it because she was worried about her SAT's and so was her boyfriend, they had already taken the PSAT's and gotten good scores but were still worried about the actual SAT's. Anyway, the movie had such hiliarious acting in it. Scarlett Johansen (who played Francesca) was like 10 times better in this than she was in Lost in Translation, I hate her as a blonde and that movie sucked, Erica Christensen did a really good job as Anna. I didn't mind Chris Evan's in Not Another Teen Movie but he did a much better job in this one. Leonardo Nam as Roy was hysterical! Bryan Greenberg did a great job as Matty and Darius Miles made a great Desmond.
