7874023,5,6304559488,"I am surprised that this film is not on DVD or Blu Ray!  Other than Marty, all other Paddy Chayefsky/Delbert Mann collaborations seem to have have been sadly overlooked.  Anyone know what needs to be done to get them going??",1380412800,5,224,4.575

7874025,5,6304559488,"I can think of less that twenty films that transcend the medium. This is one of them. I felt as if I was out on the town with these half-drunk men, depressed, and wandering down the streets of New York in search of a good time. It was a painful reminder of some of my single days. Few screen writers are able to see reality clearly, and fewer still are able to portray it as unflinchingly as Paddy Chayevsky. The dialogue is timeless.

This isn't an event-driven movie. It's a study of modern marriage. The married men wonder why they bother to slave away at monotonous jobs, just to go home at night to watch TV. Why support a boring wife? Why support an ungrateful kid in college? Why not quit my job? Why not move to Arizona? Sensing the despair of the older men, the young men wonder why they should bother with marriage at all.

To ""celebrate"" a young man's upcoming marriage, the office gang goes out on the town looking for some fun, drinking, watching stag movies, and looking for women. The atmosphere is claustrophobic and fatalistic. Over and over the men ask the question, What's in it for me? Their actions answer the opposing question, What's in it for men who don't honor their marriages? Drunkenness, dissipation, seedy strip clubs and pathetic skirt-chasing.

In the end, most of the men realize what they have. But the change of heart is strangely abrupt. Perhaps the film was edited down at the end.

The true purpose of marriage is self-sacrificial love for the good of one's spouse and children. Sacrifice and marriage go hand in hand. Happiness results when one accepts this. In the end, the happy men embrace the sacrifices necessary for a happy marriage. We're left to wonder about the others.",1365292800,4,1717,4.619672131147541
