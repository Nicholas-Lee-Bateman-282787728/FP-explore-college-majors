1829887,5,B000089746,"Personally, when I was young, I always dreamed of meeting a group of  either animals who could talk, or people that could turn into animals.  Fruits Basket is like taking a step back in time, and watching those fantasies come to life.
  I also love the reversal of what seems to be a general theme in anime of the horde of girls going after a guy to a horde of guys going after a girl.  I wish I was Toru!  Yuki, Kyo, and Haku are yummy!
  Seriously, though, Fruits Basket is about more than that.  It's about valuing real friendship, and learning to love both yourself and other people.  This dvd is great for any children old enough to shake off the few sexual connotations scattered throughout the series, as well as for adolescents and adults of all ages.",1067472000,3,759,4.39568345323741
1829888,5,B000089746,"The second Fruits Basket disc is probably the sweetest one of the three that are out so far. More of the Soma's history is shown, and more of the family's intricacies as well. The bonds between the characters are all strengthened and characterization is reinforced. Just more fun cuteness from Fruits Basket!",1050451200,3,308,4.9423076923076925
1829889,5,B000089746,"To read the title you'd think this was just another boring anime.  WRONG!  This wacky series about the Sohma family that are all cursed as one animal of the chinese zodiac and get turned into them whenever someone of the opposite sex hugs them.  Ranma, move over!  The Sohma family is a zany bunch of misfit personalities from Momiji, too cute for words and older than he looks, to Kyo and Kagura who when approached the right way are sweet but have vicious tempers.  And lets not forget Hatsuharu and Black Haru (eep!).  This is a must see for any true anime fan.  The characters alone will keep you in stiches so much you'll have to watch it again to see what all you've missed laughing.  This anime definetly rates 5 stars.  I'd give it 10 if I could.  Although waiting a month for it to come out with the next one is hard.  Oh well, just rewatch this one!",1049760000,13,859,4.30625
1829890,5,B000089746,"This is, as mentioned before, I very sweet anime. Beyond that though, there is a very sincere and engaging core of seriousness that lurks behind the constant benevolence of Honda Tohru. I won't offer any spoilers, but as the series progresses, the characters develop well beyond the statics they seem at first. NOBODY has had a happy or easy childhood, and the vinettes on each character emphasize the ways that each one of them deals with their curse. A genuinely engaging look at a marvelously magical concept, that explores the meaning of perseverance and what the defination of 'love' truly is. (ack, and now I sound like an info-mercial.) This is a GREAT series! Buy it!",1044316800,3,675,4.827586206896552
1829891,4,B000089746,"Fruits Basket is an anime that you watch with a girlfriend.  It's warm, fuzzy, and pink, and it knows this.  Not saying it's a bad series, it's very nicely drawn and animated.  The story draws you in, and the characters are interesting.  The soundtrack is lilting and sweet.  Heavily episodic though, there is some character growth, but Honda Tohru is in many ways a flat character, making profound changes upon the lives of others though.  It's a good series, one that I would recommend, especially if you want to get your girlfriend into anime.",1043625600,2,546,4.75531914893617
1829892,5,B000089746,"I picked up the first dvd after viewing the preview dvd with the Dragonball GT preview & enjoyed it, but this one was better. Having set up the story on the first dvd, Fruits Basket adds several members of the Sohma family, cursed & not, all who seem to know about Tohru knowing the family secret (major word of mouth?). Haru's probably my fav of those intro'd(cool look, interesting personality), but Hatori's sad & interesting. Momiji's just scary(tooooo cute, but older than he looks/acts). I still like Kyo best & he's developing well on this one. We meet Akito in Hatori's memories & see him hanging on a window sill watching Tohru--forboding enough. At this point he seems the stereotype selfish invalid(like Colin from Secret Garden), thus very threatening as the head of the family with the power to order Tohru's memories erased bt Hatori. My daughter & I died laughing at Shigure teasing his editor over the 500 pages she wanted from him & when he went off to school to pick up Yuki's homework singing ""High school girls"", we had to back up the dvd to see what we'd missed laughing. This dvd actually gives us a good reason for Tohru needing to be so darn sweet to remain in the Sohma household. The preview is horrible-I can hardly wait 2 mos for the next one to come out to see what they mean about Akito & Tohru.",1043539200,9,1325,4.525
1829903,5,B000089746,"Disc 2 of season one of Fruits Basket begins with an episode about teamwork. The students in Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo's class must make a rice ball stand, and they all have different ideas of how to run it. Ultimately they end up going with an idea of Yuki's, much to Kyo's annoyance. He also reveals to Tohru that he is envious of some of Yuki's personality traits, as Yuki revealed in the previous disc that he sometimes wishes he was like Kyo. This causes Tohru much contemplation, as she wishes that they could each openly admit their admiration for each other. On the day of the sale more Sohma's enter the picture. Momitchi (or Momiji) Sohma, the young boisterous lad who is possessed by the rabbit and Hatari (Ha'ri) Sohma who's animal manifests itself to appear as a seahorse, but in actuality is a dragon. They were both born  in 1987 and 1976 respectively, as close as I can figure it.

Hatari becomes an important plot element as some of his past is quickly revealed. He was, in fact, engaged to a woman, a member of the Sohma clan who is not a zodiac member (not all Sohma's are). He encounters difficulty when he tells Akito, the head of the Sohma house hold, that he and Kana are to be wed, and Akito acts out against this by harming Hatari permanently. This scene was actually one of the first in the series that made me cry...one of the first, which implies that there are more tear-jerker moments, and trust me there are many heart sickening moments that these unfortunate cursed people end up having to endure.

Another character is also introduced, in fact it's my favorite character, Hatsuharu Sohma, Haru to the family. This young man is possessed by the spirit of the ox and is born in the year 1985. He physically resembles his animal counterpart, what with his white tipped hair and black roots... his hair is so white that Tohru mistakenly thinks he is an older man passed out on the ground when she first meets him. The thing that draws me to Haru is his ""white/black"" sides. See, when he is ""white"" Haru he is docile and pleasant, like a cow, but when he is ""black"" Haru he becomes enraged like the bull, and it's hard to keep him from harming people. He also seems to suffer Tourette's syndrome when he is black Haru, which I find hysterical. I guess I have always been inclined to split personality characters, I can blame this on the fact that I am a Gemini, I suppose.

Again, the series is wonderful. I can't say enough good things about it. I love the animation, the soundtrack is wonderful, most of the scores are very well done. I have been watching it in the dubbed version (eek, I know, I'm so unfaithful) and I find all of the voice actors to be very good. One thing I have noticed in my years of watching anime is that the dubbed voice acting has improved ten thousand fold. This is good for me, as I can never sit down and just watch anything, so I must have the dubbed on in order to be able to hear it with whatever else I am doing. I guess my only complaint is that there are not enough girls in it, but there are enough beautiful boys in it that I am not unhappy. It is Shojo after all, and what would Shojo anime be without bizarre circumstances, beautiful boys, and gut wrenching scenarios... oh, and there is, indeed, the delicious love story/triangle in place, which I imagine will only become juicier as the series progresses. What's not to love about this series?",1128038400,,3409,4.423566878980892
1829904,4,B000089746,"In this volume, Tohru meets three more Zodiac members as word of her starts to spread through the Sohma family.

First there's Momiji the Rabbit, a hyper, friendly boy who's both more childish and wiser than his years.  He hits it off with Tohru immediately and in most ways it's perhaps her easiest introduction.  She'll need it, because soon after she's unnerved by a meeting with Hatori the Dragon.  Although decent in and of himself, it's Hatori who will have to erase Tohru's memories if that's what word eventually comes down from Akito, so Yuki warns her never to let him see her alone.  Finally there's Hatsuharu the Ox, who's pretty tight with Yuki (and not so much with Kyo) as the Zodiac legend told earlier implied.  Haru's just about the nicest guy you could meet, his street tough appearance contrasting a sweet personality.  Unfortunately he suffers a split personality that makes Kagura's seem tame by comparison, which makes his first meeting with Tohru a bit of an experience.

After the meetings, we get one of the funniest episodes so far.  Let's just say it involves Kyo, Kagura and Valentine's day.  Be  afraid.  Be very afraid.

As usual, mixed in with comedy is more than a little drama.  Tohru sees Hatori in a different light when Momiji tells her his story; and she learns a little more about Yuki from Haru,  who tells her how he developed a crush on him when Yuki helped him overcome his humiliation at being the family joke because the Ox blindly gave the Rat a free ride to the banquet.

A wonderful continuation.",1123286400,3,1544,4.684014869888476
1829905,5,B000089746,"'Furuba' is how many fans of the anime refer to this series. I became interested in it before I knew they had translated it to English and bought my subtitled DVDs from Hong Kong courtesy of EBay. ;-)

Tohru is an ordinary high school girl with a good heart who tends to see the good in people. This has a tendency to bring out the good in the people she befriends, such as Uo, a former Yankee (gang member) and Hana (troublemaker from another school with the ability to sense things psychically).

Before the beginning of the story, Tohru's mother dies when she's hit by a truck so Tohru goes to live with her paternal grandfather. When her grandfather's house is being remodeled to accommodate still more family, Tohru tells her grandfather that she will be all right and stay with her friends. Still, she knows that Hana has a large family and has no room and Uo has only one small room that she rents and that they really have no room; so she decides on her own to go and live in the woods while the renovations are underway.

After all this is when this charming and engaging story begins. Through a series of misadventures and an accidental discovery, Tohru finds herself earning her keep as a housekeeper for Sohma Shigure rather than sleeping in the forest. Her housemates are Sohma Yuki and Sohma Kyo.

It's not what you're thinking. She discovers a dark family secret of theirs (no, she's not blackmailing them) which enables her to become good friends as well as staying with them until the renovations are complete. You see, when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex, they turn into animals representing characters from the legend behind the Chinese zodiac. Yuki becomes the rat, Shigure the dog -- and Kyo's the cat who was tricked and then left behind.

The story continues from there as we meet the rest of the members of the Sohma clan, at least the ones most important to the story.

My daughter's disgusted with me but I'm rather fond of the series. At least, she claims to be; but she's looking up newer issues of the manga online. ;-)",1102550400,,2065,4.522788203753351
1829906,5,B000089746,"I really like this anime, but it is very sweet, and a little sad at times, but I love it! It is funny, cute, sad, and happy all at the same time! I think everyone can find a character that they realte to or admire. It's has really good animation, the music is fun and new, plus it's filled with magic. It's great how all the characters interact together, most are a little over the top, but very entertaining! I recomend and hope you watch and enjoy this anime series!",1093392000,,468,4.211111111111111
1829907,5,B000089746,"Fruits Basket is quite an interesting anime, at first the show seems to over the top, and can turn off potential viewers with the giant eyes and the crazy fan club girls,  but on episode two the show really kicks off, and with the introduction of new characters, each of whom are unique and different in their own way and devolop quite a bit over the course of the series, the show becomes even funnier, as a note Fruits Basket has an amazing dub, for those who like dubs, in fact, most of the time I watch this series dubbed.
As a note I consider the Fruits Basket DVDs to be really the first truely amazingly done DVDS, at the time (Or at least to my knowledge) most Anime discs had 2-5 episodes and th only features were textless endings (Can you say crappy and boring?) but Fruits basket has not only previews for other Funimation stuff, but interviews, a documentary of the ""eye catches"" (Which are explained in the documentry) and even behind the scenes footage. AND 6 episodes per disc, and the disc has 3 regions, any fan of special features would freak out, why the only way they could get any better would be is if it came with a poster or something rather.
Overall I suguest Fruits Basket to anyone who is willing to give it a chance, the anime has elements from many genres and is a perfect balance of Comedy and Character devolopment.

1829910,5,B000089746,"In this, the second DVD of the brilliant Fruits Basket series, Tohru gets her first indication that the Sohma curse is not all as cute and cuddly as she finds it.  At a school festival, she meets the affectionate and enthusiastic child, Momiji Sohma, and his attendant, the cold family doctor, Hatori.  Hatori speaks to her privately and orders her to meet him secretly at the main house of the Sohmas...a large mansion, far removed from Shigure's cosy, fragile little house in the woods.  There, Hatori warns her to flee the Sohma house while she still can.  Momiji tells Tohru later of Hatori's own private tragedy at the hands of the Sohmas.  On her departure, Tohru catches her first glance at Akito, the dreaded head of the family.
  Any fear that Hatori instilled is short-lived, though, and soon Tohru is her happy self again, planning New Years festivities and taking part in a trip to a hot spring...she meets two of the more psychotic members of the enormous Sohma family, outspends her budget, and takes part in a school endurance run.  Some very funny stuff on this disc, including Shigure's evading his editor, and Hana's participation in the school run.",1074729600,3,1167,4.8
1829911,5,B000089746,"Fruits Basket is the most amazing series ever! I love the dvds and though I have not seen them all I've done my research. Basically Tohru (as we know is living in a tent, moves in- in Shigure's home ladadada) learns more about the Sohma family through Haru and Momiji. Also perhaps slightly through Hatori (I don't know if hes in yet...) but anyways its all as usual sooooooo cute. I love how they develope characters and inner personailtys...I did notice that Akito has no Zodiac animal and my friend gave me a great view to look at him as...Akito represents God, who was the one who invited the animals to the banquet and picked and chose between them?",1070496000,,654,4.504201680672269

7980038,4,B000089746,"Fruits Basket is a great anime. It's about an orphaned girl who goes to live with a family of shape shifters. The members of the Sohma family are cursed. When they touch a member of the opposite sex they turn into a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac. The story follows Tohru and her life with this weird family.

I had a great time watching this anime and I think it's fantastic. That being said; it lacked something that could have made it a lot better. Emotion. There were some touching moments. Like the story of the family's doctor, and the ending where Kyo turns into his true form. If the relationships between the characters were developed a little more, instead of everyone being so stand offish the whole time those moments could have been more memorable. I'm not bashing this series at all. I actually really like it. My point is that it had way more potential than was actually achieved.

The animation in Fruits Basket is high quality. The soundtrack and voice acting are also very good. The anime was produced masterfully. It's a classic, but it's a far cry from being one of the best anime's of all time. That being said it's definitely not one to miss.",1354060800,,1172,4.549763033175355

7980040,4,B000089746,"Having introduced the kooky Sohma family and their curse, ""Fruits Basket"" starts introducing some of its darker dimensions.

To make matters even more complex, ""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to three new members of the Sohma family, as well as a look at how the mysterious Akito rules over them. But despite these darker moments, the series never strays too far from the warm-hearted comedy and appealing characters.

Our leads are all involved in the school's Cultural Festival, despite Yuki's distress at having to wear a dress. But then two new Sohmas turn up: bubbly rabbit Momiji, and the chilly Hatori, who tells Tohru to meet him at the Sohma main house -- alone. Despite Tohru's nervousness, she obeys -- and finds out the painful facts about Hatori's past, and the isolation felt by cursed Sohmas.

When New Year's rolls around, Tohru and her friends help Kyo and Yuki clean the house, while Shigure torments his hysterical editor Mii. They're expected back at the main Sohma house, but the boys are reluctant to leave Tohru alone. And a school endurance run is interrupted by Haru Sohma, who is determined to fight Kyo -- but their battle is interrupted when Yuki collapses.

Then Valentine's Day comes around. Tohru has chocolate for everyone (literally), Yuki is stalked by his fangirls, and Kagura is busily trying to feed Kyo a chocolate heart the size of his head. And a month later, Momiji repays Tohru's favour by giving her an extravagant gift -- a trip to a hot spring.

There are definitely some darker moments to ""Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" Most of these come from Hatori's tragic past, and the revelation of just what a lonely, painful life many of the zodiac members lead. Even the younger ones like Haru aren't immune, since we see that he was often mocked for his animal's part in the old zodiac folktale.

But don't worry, the dark spots are surrounded by lots of heartwarming moments (Momiji's ""foolish traveler"" story) and goofy dialogue (""No means NO, woman!""). And there's loads of comedy, from Shigure tormented Mii by refusing to write the rest of his novel, to the shrieking hostess at the hot spring. (""AAAAAAAAA! I'm sorry, world! I apologize for this boy! I'm SORREEEEEE..."").

I have to admit that the hot spring episode is a bit slow, since much of it involves eating and soaking. And singing. But it has some cute moments like Yuki laughing, and the crazed ping-pong game.

We also get to see some different sides of Tohru and her friends -- for instance, it's revealed that despite her cheery demeanor, Tohru is sometimes very lonely for her mother. Yuki continues trying to come out of his shell, while Kyo verrrrrry slowly tries to overcome his social awkwardness. The ""plum on the back"" scene ends up being adorable because of this.

And we get to meet some new Sohmas, particularly Haru and Hatori. Haru has a dual personality -- one placid and serene, one violent and lecherous -- and a tumultuous past with Yuki. And Hatori comes across as the most tragic figure thus far, convinced that he is doomed to loneliness, and haunted by what happened when he dared to love someone.

""Fruits Basket, Volume 2: What Becomes of Snow?"" introduces us to some new Sohmas, and some dark secrets. But it also never lets up on the warm'n'fuzzy smiles.",1205193600,,3320,4.778359511343805
