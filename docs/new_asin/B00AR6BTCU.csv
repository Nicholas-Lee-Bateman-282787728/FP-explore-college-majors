5480788,2,B00AR6BTCU,"I watched about a third of this movie, and learned only that some of the characters have an aversion to old people (mentioned twice), and that at least one ghost, a boy who died young, would come when called.  That would, for most people, be a startling development, but the girl--the main character--who met and talked to him seem not as surprised by it as a normal person should be.  Either she was mentally deranged, or, more likely, a victim of bad writing.  Beyond that, the movie went nowhere during the first 30 minutes, and anywhere it could go after that seemed less than interesting to me.  The imagery and photography were beautiful, and the direction competent, but the acting seemed amateurish.  Sorry.  It could just be me, but I don't think so.",1398643200,8,759,4.669172932330827

5480790,4,B00AR6BTCU,"I found out about this film online. It's in spoken English but the accents suggest international actors. Which makes sense in the setting. It's a fine film which could be well received by fans of classic Disney and fairy tales but lacks distribution. Add it too any ""to watch"" list and I guarantee it'd be a huge success.",1391385600,,321,4.551724137931035
5480791,5,B00AR6BTCU,This movie isn't really one you watch as the one you savor. The story is good but the photography and the scenery are what make this five stars.,1494547200,,144,4.178571428571429

5480808,5,B00AR6BTCU,"This is a story of romance and love, of longing and hope, and of friends and family.  It is also a mystery that slowly unravels until the full truth is known by all.  The setting is a small Italian village, with some scenes in India as well.  The story centers around four girls who appear to be between 18 and 22 years of age.  Three are looking for love, and one is searching to find out who her real parents were.  Anyone who enjoys a love story set in a foreign land will enjoy this movie.  It has beautiful music and scenery, and a wonderful message to impart to all who listen carefully with their hearts.  As some others have noted, there are no sex scenes or foul language, there are no fights or unkind words spoken.  There is a ghost, but his only goal is to be helpful.  Everyone works together in this movie in happy ways, and thus it gives us all hope that if we help one another, the outcome will be good for us all.  I found the movie to be very spiritual and gently tender.  The characters made mistakes in their past, but forgiveness reigns, and it hints at a beautiful life after death.  Although it was meant for the youth, particularly girls, parents will enjoy this as well as they watch it with their daughters and young sons.  We enjoyed it so much that we decided to purchase it.",1453334400,4,1303,4.2693877551020405
5480809,2,B00AR6BTCU,"I really wanted to like this movie, and based on the average review I thought I would......but it was boring at best, and the acting was quite bad.  The story felt poorly written and certain questions in my mind were never answered.  For example, why would the main character's guardian refuse to tell her who her parents were and how she came to be in his care?  Why leave her wondering? There really was nothing particularly mysterious or scandalous about her parents that it needed to be kept from her.  Also, there is a ghost boy (and a really bad actor), and his part was so ridiculous that it took away all credibility of the film for me.  Finally, there is a boy who stopped speaking at the age of 5, and you think the reason is going to be something shocking.....but the actual reason is just silly, not realistic, and truly just a let down.  Could have been a good film....but it just wasn't.",1451520000,,901,4.430303030303031

Beyond that you must throw away any regard for logic, continuity, acting ability...etc.  I should have paid more attention to the reviewers who described it as a ""fairytale.""

5480868,2,B00AR6BTCU,"If you want to watch a movie with your 8 year old daughter - fine.  This seems as though it was written by a young girl for that market in mind.  The writing is very predictable, immature and simple.  It's basically a fairy tale as told by child.  I wish I had understood this before I purchased the rental - money not well spent and time wasted.  I couldn't make it through to the end.  The plot sounded intriguing, the trailer looked interesting and the photography beautiful.  The photography is nice but the movie is so flawed on so many levels and the acting so bad that the photography alone cannot redeem this movie.",1403481600,,623,4.412280701754386

It's refreshing to have good story line without sex and vulgarity interrupting the story. It reminds me of when men would not speak vulgar in the presence of a lady and ladies knew how to behave lady-like, and with class. It's a taste of a simpler time when people simply enjoyed each other's company and the easy going life style of Italy before the rat race and technology filled the globe.  It's safe for families with high morals.",1400976000,7,582,4.290909090909091

5480893,2,B00AR6BTCU,Cheesy someone tried to combine all the elements of every story all in one movie.  I found it ridiculous.  This movie is best watched by a young tween with no ideal of plot.,1400889600,,173,4.212121212121212
5480894,5,B00AR6BTCU,"This film won the Feelgood Film Festival a year ago (?) and my cousin who lives in L.A. was gushing about how absolutely awesome it was. Now that I finally saw it on Amazon I got together with a girlfriend and a bottle of Ros and we watched this cute and heartwarming movie, laughed and cried and wished we were in Italy right now. The movie tells the story of a young woman who is an orphan and doesn't know who her parents were. She travels to Italy in search of clues about her family's background and ends up living in a run-down old house. She hangs out with three Italian sisters from the village (the actresses are a delight) and there are many mysteries that unfold in due time. The pace is quite slow and there is some really beautiful music in the film, also a song that I found on MySpace after visiting the film's Facebook page and couldn't stop listening to. Anyway if you are romantic and love beautiful scenery and people and clothes this movie is perfect for you. I was looking to buy a DVD on Amazon to send to my mother (who doesn't know how to stream movies) but I couldn't find one anywhere. Would warmly recommend this movie and so would my friend with who I watched.",1400716800,,1188,4.308035714285714

recommended viewing.",1399852800,,134,5.75
5480903,2,B00AR6BTCU,We thought we would see some great Italian scenery and a good story. Storyline is poor and didn't hold interest. Some nice scenery but Under Tuscan Skies much better in both storyline and scenery.,1399766400,,196,4.794117647058823
5480904,3,B00AR6BTCU,There were a few times I considered stopping the movie yet held on through the end.  The storyline was somewhat interesting and there were several messages which I appreciated towards the end.  I liked that it was set in Italy.  It's a blend of corny meets fairytale.  It's average.,1399334400,,282,4.6938775510204085
5480905,5,B00AR6BTCU,"Our whole family - me and my wife, girls 13 and 15 watched the movie together. We have a movie night every week and each family member can choose a movie once a month. our 13 year old wanted to watch ""The Italian Key"" so we did and absolutely loved it. It's basically a chick flick so guys might not be that much into it as it develops fairly slowly and doesn't have action. But it is so beautiful to watch, so heart-warming and lovely, my girls wanted to see it again with their friends soon. My younger daughter and wife were crying in the end (which is very happy), and I have to admit I was welling up too, but no visible tears! Anyway, a joy to watch and is nice for the whole family, especially if you want to watch something together with teen or pre-teen daughters.",1399075200,21,773,4.194630872483222
5480906,3,B00AR6BTCU,"The Italian Key [HD] - This is a light-hearted mystery romance. We watched it during an evening in when we needed some down time.  It is a movie that is easy to watch, challenges enough not to exhaust when you are tired, keeps your attention and is an ok story. It would not be in Oscar contention, but it's good for an evening at home.",1398729600,9,336,4.1692307692307695

8556799,5,B00AR6BTCU,"I love a film where the location takes my breathe away.  You will want to visit Italy when you see this little gem.  The acting you have to get used to because English is not these ladies first language, but they are genuine in their roles.  Very sweet film for the whole family.",1519430400,,279,4.226415094339623

8556801,1,B00AR6BTCU,Please save your money and Do Not rent this terrible movie! The acting is beyond ridiculous. So so bad. The settings are lovely but the storyline is stale and slow. I honestly couldn't finish it. There is actually a character that is dead but seems to be able to hear. Like the director forgot the character is deaf and mute!,1518998400,,325,4.433333333333334

Full of pretty girls, a deaf mute who actually hears and speaks, a guy who is paralyzed in a wheelchair who stands up and dances, a boy ghost on a mission in an inherited villa, come on!  Never seen so many cliches!",1514332800,,279,4.226415094339623
8556804,5,B00AR6BTCU,"Satisfying movie. Such beautiful cinematography and feeling. Good story. I just couldn't bear to give it less than 5 stars. Although the acting wasn't that great, it was never fake somehow and was engaging and interesting and in many places simply lovely. A movie like this is for someone who longs for the peaceful and beautiful, for caring and naturalness, albeit an interesting story unfolding to follow the clues of that which was meaningful to her. Love how India was featured in the movie even though it was entirely based in Italy. Whoever made this movie knew us out here somehow, those who need the beauty and natural humanity and peace and kindness in these intense times (on earth, yes; but is reflected also as so many dark or awful movies this last decade or so). They writers, movie makers, actors have given me, at least, a movie that feels fulfilling at a deeper level, which is few and far between these days and very much appreciated. 5 star from me.",1505433600,3,968,4.666666666666667
8556805,1,B00AR6BTCU,$5 to rent.....but worth $0.50 at the most. Decent plot......great views of Italy.......absolutely terrible acting which was reminiscent of a high school play. Mixing Italian with English and then throwing in the Indian flavor was a bit much. My wife speaks fluent Italian and was not impressed at all.,1500508800,2,302,5.183673469387755
8556806,4,B00AR6BTCU,It was an unexpected pleasure. Like the storyline silly and fun.,1496102400,,64,4.909090909090909
