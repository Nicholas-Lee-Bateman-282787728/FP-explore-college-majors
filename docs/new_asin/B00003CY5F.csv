1325844,4,B00003CY5F,"Entering the theatre for America's Sweethearts, I was ill equipped for the film that I was about to see.  I anticipated a subtle, romantic comedy; I got a silly, character-driven film, and I'm not the least bit dissapointed.  America's Sweethearts can at times be very heartfelt and sentimental, and then make an absurd 180 that turns to slapstick humor and likewise creates for a very lighthearted and fun film.
Perhaps the greatest asset from the script by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan is their use of characters.  None of the characters are simple; they all have their indiosyncracies that contribute to the greater plot and most occur quite successfully through the talented acting of the all-star cast.
The plot is flawed perhaps, only because the film concerns too little with the junket (or ""hunket"" as Hank Azaria hilariously phrases it) and also, and more dissapointingly, the main romantic relationship.  I almost don't know where the time went, but the filmmakers could have afforded a little more screen time to these two areas.
All in all, though, any viewer is in for a treat, if they can manage to sustain themselves through some of the more sillier moments.  It's a worthy film from some of Hollywood's best!",1003536000,,1225,4.927184466019417
1325845,2,B00003CY5F,"I like John Cusack. I've liked him since Better Off Dead, Say Anything, and every other 80s movie he was in. His best characters seem to fall between hapless loser (B.O.D.) and nice guy with quirks (Grosse Pointe Blank, Say Anything). Here he tries to pull off a Blockbuster movie (it was not), by trading his tried-and-true characters for a boring and lifeless  one.
I also like pre-Egotistical Blowhard Julia Roberts (before her coveted Oscar). She is simply not convincing as a homely underdog, and contrary to movie posters and trailers, has very little screen time. Catherine Zeta Jones is a fairly descent actress, as well, but is not quite suited for comedy. Her part as the wench would actually have been better played by Roberts, in my opinion.
Director Joe Roth said he wanted to make a movie like they used to - Some Like it Hot, His Girl Friday, etc. - where the characters play well off each other. I guess he though that he could buy the chemistry he wanted. Big egos together on screen sometimes work (Heat, The Score), but in this sorry movie, everyone seems to try to outdo the other.  Some parts are funny, but the laughs were not consistent or lasting.
On a side note...this movie contains a surprising amount of crude humor, which Some Like it Hot and His Girl Friday successfully avoided.",1003190400,,1309,4.662337662337662
1325846,1,B00003CY5F,"Flat, boring and completely unsympathetic romantic comedy that completely wastes the talent of everyone involved. Billy Crystal (who unfortunately wrote and produced) plays a publicity director at a major Hollywood studio who finds himself bound in problems when he is forced to reunite estranged Tom-and-Nicole-like couple Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas (Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack) for a press junket of the last movie they've made together. Trouble is, they hate each other, and getting them in the same room again is going to be more difficult than it seems. Adding to the complications, Gwen's sister and assistant Kiki (Julia Roberts) has a bit of a jones for Eddie, Gwen is shacked up with a latino lover (Hank Azaria, doing a heterosexual version of his character in The Birdcage) with a real jealousy complex, and Eddie finds himself drawn to both women simultaneously without knowing which way to go. Despite all the witty lines and a few funny moments, there is not a whiff of inspired comedy in this insipid film, nothing important enough ever happens to chase away the utter boredom it pulls over you, and none of the star quality we've been seeing by Julia Roberts of late (even The Mexican was worth watching for her) is in evidence here. It is just not possible to enjoy a film full of such annoyingly selfish and inhuman people. To be avoided at all costs!",1001635200,,1380,4.901709401709402
1325847,2,B00003CY5F,"This film was unfortunately a typical Julia Robert's film.  In other words it was average at best.
Billy Crystal was wonderful as usual, and Catherine Zeta Jones did a splendid job in her role of the snotty sister.  But Cusack and Robert's didn't bring it together.
The plot was your typical love story plot, but the poor acting of Roberts and Cusack simply wrecked it.  Robert's gave her typical stinted and lacksidaisical acting and didn't draw you into her character at all.
Unfortunately the great cast couldn't bring it together with this film.
I'd wait until this one hits the cheap theatres or rent it.  Don't waste your money at the theatres, you will only be disappointed.",999648000,,681,4.794871794871795

1325973,3,B00003CY5F,"Acting is first rate, the plot could use some tweeking.  It's just a frothy predictable low key comedy, nothing more, nothing less.

1325974,4,B00003CY5F,"I really liked this movie. I love easy going movies like this one and the minute I saw Billy Crystal was in, I was set. There's something about Billy Crystal that I just like in movies. Same goes with John Cusack, he is one of those actors that you don't sit and think about much, but whose movies you thoroughly enjoy the character they portray. Because of this movie, I've noticed that about John Cusack and now I am on a John Cusack fiend. I don't want to make the review about him, but damn! It's true. The man delivers!

Now: The Movie.

Like, I said, it's easy-going with easy dialogue. I understand how other reviewers may think ""not focused"" or ""weak plot""...but that is what's easy going about it. The movie doesn't place Billy Crystal as the protagonist. His job is to get the actors back together for the movie premiere and make a Boom! because the Producer (Tucci) has not even seen the movie yet. How can they promote a movie they haven't seen? They have to get the Actors' in order to make the premiere about them. I thought that was entertaining and true. The catch is that the actors' are recently divorced. You have Zeta-Jones playing the ultimate Hollywood Diva who cheats on John Cusack with an Extra (why does it always happen to John?! He's such a nice guy) and leaves him. John has a breakdown after attempting to murder Zeta-Jones, although he claims it was an accident, and for some reason all that is hilarious. There's also ""Kiki""  (Roberts), Zeta-Jones sister and Assistant, who harbors a secret crush on Cusack...and that's the movie in a nutshell.

Playing the eccentric Director of the movie is :D Christopher Walken and the guy is just magnificent like everything he does. Love this man to the moon and back. In here, he is...well, you know! The guy is amazing!

I guess that there was so much going on. I wish that we could've seen John Cusack and Julia Roberts' characters a little bit more developed in order to explain how this man who loves his ex-wife, is really in love with his ex-wife sister instead. I would've liked to see a better realization of that fact. Also, the kiss scenes could've been better.

About reviews, I always suggest that you don't listen to the naysayers or people who love certain movies. Just watch it because what it's not of taste for others may be of your own taste.

Don't expect an Oscar movie, but I really rarely like Oscar-worthy films.

Christopher Walken lived up to his role perfectly.  There were a few great gags and some really good laughs. I only watch movies to laugh.  I didn't know Billy Crystal was one of the writers till watching the credits.  I just love Billy's comedy style, timing and delivery.  Billy, you and Garry did a great job.

The restaurant scene was absolutely idiotic - NOBODY would act like that in the real world in an upscale restaurant like that.  It is hard to follow what the point of the movie is all about.  Even the scene where Cusak is pulling out the cactus thorns from his pants was over the top.  When the camera is on him full on, it looks as if he is pulling them out.  Then from the back, it doesn't look like he is pulling them out at all - but they made it look as if he was doing something else entirely.  Very stupid movie.

Then it shifts again and becomes a weird romantic comedy about one of the stars and his soon-to-be-ex-sister-in-law.  And then in the end, it returns to being about the promoter.

1326534,1,B00003CY5F,"With a cast like this (John Cusack, Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Hank Azaria) you'd think they couldn't go wrong!  WRONG. This movie was boring, it had very weak humor, and the characters and their relationships were completely unbelievable (Who treats her sister like that? What nice guy would have married such a narcissist in the first place? What producer actually hopes that someone will kill themselves in order to improve a movie's ratings?)  The main event  the romance between Cusack and Roberts  just kind of happens without much lead-up; for most of the movie he's obsessed with someone else, and then suddenly he sees the light. You can't even cheer for them: they have no chemistry, no romantic tension.

By the way, I realize that romantic comedies as a genre are not particularly deep or challenging or artistic, but I like most of them anyway.  Heck, I've even enjoyed the occasional Hallmark Christmas movie, so you know that my standards are pretty low.  :-)  But ""America's Sweethearts"" failed to meet even that modest standard. This movie has some of my favorite actors so I stuck it out, thinking that surely it would get better eventually, but it didn't.  I could go on, but why bother?

1326688,5,B00003CY5F,"I love this movie. I fell in love to this movie. I was on what was supposed to be a 12 hour train ride as an unaccompanied minor (I was in middle school) and met a girl. We played tag, hide and go seek, ate in the snack bar and watched the scenery in the viewing car, all while the in-ride-movie ""America's Sweethearts"" played in the background. But it snowed and at several places along the track the train had to stop or slow down, turning the half a day train ride into one and a half days. So asside from watching this movie over and over again there wasn't much to do (except when they let us out of the train in the middle of nowhere and we played in the snow)

But enough of that here is my thoughts on the movie: Decent comedy with several bigger name actors. It's all about finding love in the places we didn't expect, telling self conscious women (and men) that they have value and that life is often stranger than fiction.

Spoilers ahead

So a dynamic and popular hollywood couple has a scandelous and public break up. A year later their shared agent convinces them to promote the, yet unfinished, last movie they worked on together by shacking up in the same hotel (although they have different accommodations) for a well covered viewing of the film, all while waiting for the insanely inspired producer to finish editing the film. During which they struggle with their decisions to either reconnect, branch off into a relationship with someone new (or old in one case) or simply making bad decisions that lead to hilarious scenes for us, the audience usually by one wanting what the other wanted previously and then changing their minds.

1326896,2,B00003CY5F,"LOL--couldn't even post my first review because I mentioned some of the actual things in the movie.  I'll try prettying it up a bit.  On the plus side, the acting was good, and all the actors seemed to enjoy the roles that poked fun at Hollywood stereotypes and situations.  The overlooked ""fat"" sister of the pretty star finally getting attention and love is not a bad theme, though, (of course), she didn't become loved until she also became skinny and pretty...

However, the crude ""humor"" of the movie was heavy on the crude while the whole movie was light on the humor.

Aside from the one woman cheating on her husband with a lover, a dog giving intimate pleasure of some kind to a man, a man apparently ""enjoying his sausage"" solo on screen (though not actually), and a married woman rubbing her shoe all over the back end of a guy she was kissing passionately, lengthy discussions of one man's ""sausage"" size...just ick.

The only thing humorous was the crazy attempts to give interviews and promote a movie no one has actually seen, and then watching the absurd movie-within-a-movie that wasn't as expected (crudity there, too, though, FYI).  If the crudity was cut, the movie would be 30% shorter and much sweeter.",1483833600,,1224,4.71830985915493

Also involved in matters are the wife's sister and publicist, as well as Hector, the wife's lover. Of course their involvement complicates matters further.

1327019,2,B00003CY5F,"Quite unintentionally, I think, I have been on something of tear reviewing films about film-making (or in the case of one mostly of not making a film). This is the third straight such film review. Of course the others were two films which have been long considered classics of movies about film-making; Francois Truffauts Day for Night, his homage to his craft, and Frederico Fellinis  8  about what happens when a director runs out of ideas about making a film. The film under review, Billy Crystals Americas Sweethearts, will never be mistaken for a classic about the trials and tribulations of getting a film in the can. Despite a high profile cast of talented actors this one fails, falls flat.
Blame the weather in the Northeast this summer, hot and humid. Blame trying to take a break from heavy-duty high-toned film classics of the genre like those films mentioned above. What the heck, blame it on being hooked in by the all-star cast who in other film vehicles have won plenty of accolades for their performances. But I sat through this one grinding my teeth.

Heres where this one was both too predictable by the script as the story line played out and frankly was not that funny except in spots despite funnyman Billy Crystals efforts as actor in the film and the writer of the script. Americas sweethearts, Gwen (played by fetching Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie (played by all-purpose actor John Cusack) who not only have successfully acted together but are married as well, who due to their run of hits had been crowned with a title that many previous real acting couples like Fairbanks and Pickford, Powell and Loy, have had bestowed on them, have had a falling out. A big time falling out once Gwen slipped over the line and has an affair with one of the bit actors in their last fateful film. A film that for a couple of reasons has not been released but mainly because the director has been holding the film hostage for his own reasons (mostly when all is said and done that the thing was a stinker, was nothing but a formula piece and that the sweethearts had run out of steam).

Naturally the studio boss was going crazy since the studio had spent plenty of money banking on Gwen and Eddie being able to produce one more block-buster. So Lee (Crystals role), a publicist had been sent out by the frantic boss to make the thing go. But Eddie, who thought he still loved Gwen had a breakdown over the split, had no desire in his condition to go out and promote the film to the critics, to go on the press junket that is a staple of the release of every film, good, bad, or ugly. Lee eventually by fair means or foul got the pair on the junket trail. Got a little help on the Gwen side from her sister and personal assistant, Kiki (played by fetching Julia Roberts who during parts of the film was bizarrely cast as overweight-what are you kidding me didn't Billy see Mystic Pizza and Pretty Woman). Yeah, but see Kiki had it bad for Eddie, had that secret crush but had held back because, well, because Sis was nothing but an airhead and thought everything in the world revolved around her.

So the tensions and comedy such as they were got played out on the press junket being held a swanky hotel. Eddie finally got religion on the need to move on from perfidious Gwen, finally got religion on Kiki whom he took under the sheets and eventually wound up walking arm and arm with her in the sunset despite his ambivalence about not so sweet Gwen. But that outcome was telegraphed almost from the minute Kiki showed up on the screen early in the film. In the end the director showed up with said film, or a film, a film exposing the hypocrisy and duplicity of the main characters. Yawn, a waste of a talented cast on a thin idea and few funny lines.",1469836800,,3766,4.5

1327250,1,B00003CY5F,"I am always a sucker for any movie where the wonderful and the unexpected occurs to the average, low, or mundane.  Which was how the publicists of the Americas Sweethearts attempted to sell that picture, with Julia Roberts playing the formerly overweight and hence unattractiveeasy to believe, huh?sister of a spoiled and self centered actress who manages to earn the love of the actress estranged husband.  But this colossal waste of time presents characters so inconsistent yet irritating in a situation so esoteric and a script they may well have been improvised that after the first half-hour even the most sentimental may find themselves wishing that someone would walk into to the theater, point a gun at them, and shoot, just to avoid their having to endure the remainder.

In the setting of celebrity publicity, in which I must admit I have no knowledge nor experience, a caricature of a ruthless agent attempts to united two married but separated Hollywood sweethearts, who have played in countless movies together and have been loved, to publicize a new release.  The female is now living with Spaniard, on whom most of the jokes rely either on his lisp or his small penis sizeoriginal, no doubt.  The male, having gone into a jealous rage after seeing the two of them together, begins the movie in an Eastern ashram in hopes of gaining his sanity.  She has no desire to meet but during the course of the movie seems to express some jealousy at the possibility that he may love someone else.  He expresses both love and hate for her and at times seems to want to be with her and at others without.  Meanwhile, he and the womans sister, a former friend of the actor fall in love, leaving one with the emotion not how nice but rather where did this come from?

Now all this may seem like a worthwhile plot, designed to warm the hearts in a victory of a jilted actor and a formerly-subservient yet genuine sister at the expense of a conceited actress and her lover.  And it may all be a very clever poke at the Hollywood publicity industry with its heartless agents.  But with characters that never really make sense, attempted jokes that never seem very funny, and an industry about which I know nothing. I could only wish that at some point, each character were tied up and slapped for being so idiotic.",1393804800,,2312,4.669950738916256

However, this comedy was written by people with way above average IQ: don't come here looking for ""slapstick comedy"" or trailer trash type of stuff. America's Sweethearts engages one in surprising ways. Its story is simple, but the way it unfolds is rich in detail - from Catherine Zeta-Jones being a real Hollywood diva in constant state of distress over the most ridiculous things (""That baby was judging me!"") to John Cusack being neurotic to no end. All characters were so well written, all the humor is so good that I just can't get enough of this little gem. Just watch the first few minutes when Billy Crystal is invited by his boss, Stanely Tucci, to come and see what ""only I have seen""... minutes after he fired him... So crazy, yet so normal in Hollywood.

If you are not interested in comedies which are at the elementary school level, and especially if you happen to know how things may be in Hollywood (it helps if you live or have lived in LA), you too may like this film.

However, between immature audiences incapable of processing anything more than slapstick and Hollywood pros (including the media) who were not portrayed in good light here, there are very few people with good things to say about the film. They should just relax and learn to laugh at themselves.

BTW, Hank Azaria, Alan Arkin, Billy Crystal, Stanley Tucci, and many others, besides the obvious stars of the film such as John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Julia Roberts were absolutely wonderful! Even Larry King being himself was wonderful.",1382745600,,1785,4.711538461538462

His job was to keep things moving, when there looked to be a flat moment, slip in with a couple of jokes, when the timing was off, fill in or cut off, so as to keep the show at the proper momentum.  In other words, the other guy's could relax and do their thing because their work was constantly  andbeing edited by one of the best in the business (otherwise Mr. Sinatra would not have hired him).
In this film, of which he was co-writer, Billy Crystal pretty much does the same thing. He is the guy who is always there to highlight a bit by one or more of the stars, to provide a lift when needed, to  underscore or punch up what was going on. He made the picture into one of the most enjoyable and likable comedies still available. Not a great film, not a great comedy film, but a real pleasure. Julie Roberts was indispensable: she looks great in front of the camera's but also handles her part expertly, Catherine Zita-Jones is excellent as the self-absorbed star, while John Cusak is an able co-star as her husband.

You can't.  In fact, `America's Sweethearts' just continues to draw me back for me (and OMG is this DVD a steal!).  The plot is nicely thought out and elaborated on (I love that they add subplots that never take away from the central focus) and the chemistry between the entire cast, especially Roberts and Cusack, is phenomenal.  It is sweet, charming and bitingly memorable; `America's Sweethearts' is kind of a homerun with me.  I can't think of how it could have been better, mainly because there is always room for another rom/com if that said rom/com is done right.  `America's Sweethearts' is done better than most; MUCH BETTER.",1309392000,2,1145,4.71859296482412

I think the best thing about the movie though is the chemistry between Cusack's character and Julia Robert's character. It's sort of a different twist on the theme of the main character finding out that he or she is in love with the best friend or sibling of the person that they thought they were in love with at first. Somehow it works in the context of this movie. This movie is definitely a romantic comedy that requires some suspension of disbelief and it definitely follows some tried and true formulas, but it does it in a way that's just different enough that you feel like you are seeing something fresh. I know this movie got somewhat mediocre reviews when it came out, but I think if you give it a chance, it's a pretty entertaining film.",1254528000,,1060,4.385786802030457
1327462,3,B00003CY5F,"Oh, yeah... this one. You'd think, given the caliber of the actors involved, that AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS would've come out a more entertaining picture. But, while it does have its standout moments (some, not many), the movie more than anything feels smug and condescending. So, while I guess I overall enjoyed watching the movie, parts of it leave me cold. If you toil in the Hollywood industry, then you may get more out of this film and also better appreciate all those knowing insider digs. Me, I'm kind of shaking my head at the wasted potential, wondering how two terrific performers like John Cusack and Julia Roberts manage to get caught sleepwalking thru their roles.

America's movie sweethearts are actually estranged actor couple Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack). They've gone their separate ways but are convinced by their smarmy, conniving press agent Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) into going on a press junket in the desert to promote their latest picture. The self-absorbed Gwen goes because her cinematic career is on the skids. And Eddie, a neurotic wreck, he goes because he still hopes to reconcile with Gwen, despite a year and a half in therapy (apparently, he tried to kill her).

Lee Phillips, orchestrating and scrambling like mad while he manages his bickering, high maintainance problem couple, is stressed out because he hasn't yet seen the actual movie. He keeps the press junket film critics at bay by contriving an illusion that Gwen and Eddie are still together and also by holding the special film screening in the desert, where the press is easier to control. Oh, and then there's Kiki (Julia Roberts), Gwen's saintly personal assistant and once-fat-but-now-slender sister, who's still carrying a torch for Eddie. And off they all go.

Sheer star power attempts to carry this picture; it's certainly not the story. AMERICA'S SWEETHEART is a lightweight farce and a predictable halfhearted romance, and it fails in its try to recapture the frenetic magic of those old screwball films of the '30s and '40s. I guess the most disappointing thing is that the leads, as likeable as they are, still fail to make their characters warm and sympathetic This just might possibly have been done on purpose. Billy Crystal, who co-wrote the screenplay, seems to have intended for this story to be a snarky expos  on the hypocrisy and silliness of Tinseltown, more so than a winsome romantic comedy, and I'm guessing that this called for a demonstration of how utterly silly and superficial and vain most actors are. Mission accomplished, but I find myself lukewarm to these characters and without inclination to root for anyone. Of them all, I'm leaning towards liking Hank Azaria's character best, because as oily and narcissistic as Gwen's macho boyfriend may be, he still comes off the most honest. Azaria looks like he's having a lot of fun as Hector the Latin lover, and I dig that line Hector says when being interviewed: ""I really want to play a character like the Terminator, because I think the Hispanic people are crying out to see a deadly destructive killing machine that they can embrace as their own.""

As I've already said, I enjoyed the film more so than not because, when push comes to shove, I do like these actors. But it's a bland sort of enjoyment. AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS really is a case of could've been more, should've been more. It's a very workable premise, with the film starting off promisingly in a series of nice set-ups. But then the film succumbs to generic, cliched storytelling, turning into what it first intended to lampoon. For one thing, I wish the press junket backdrop were mined more in terms of satire and humor. And, as much as I like Julia Roberts, I'm not sure she was right for her part, too bigger than life for the mousy Kiki. Anyway, to add a finishing touch to this Hollywood send-up, the whole thing climaxes shrilly during the screening of Gwen and Eddie's new movie, in which dirty laundry is publicly aired, weewees are disparaged, and Christopher Walken makes a grand entrance.

The premise of ""America's Sweethearts"" sets us up for an inspired, lacerating, in-your-face send-up of Hollywood and silly rom-com star vehicles. Then it turns into one of them. Like a young mind full of bright ideas, originality and vision, it sells out and becomes the very type of evil it was speaking out against.

Although John Cusack isn't as great as he certainly used to be, you could always count on him to sign up for only the highest-caliber projects. But this shows strong signs of a dry spell. I'm guessing the flowing river of scripts sent to him is beginning to run dry.

Ever since Lloyd Dobbler in ""Say Anything,"" Cusack has pretty much been type-casted into playing the same role: The smart, calculated, neurotic and love-sick guy who has just been dumped by the love of his life (Better Off Dead, Being John Malkovich, High Fidelity), and seems too smart and adult for his age). Cusack has always seemed so advanced for his age, but now he seems to have grown into his age and now, he's just another routine pedestrian actor.

Now I enjoy Crystal in his movies (although his steady-fire Jewish borscht-belt shtick is wearing thin). And here he does his usual bit here as a fluent veteran c**k-and-bull, scam artist, fast-talking PR agent. This is the role Crystal was born to play. And he's been playing it since he was born.

But the movie (which was co-written and co-produced by Crystal) has to make Crystal into a sweetheart. Billy Crystal has always been more of a Borscht-Belt comedian than an actor, which is why he always plays himself in any movie he does, and here he does his usual Oscar-night banter as the PR Lee Phillips who flashes a showbiz smile and orchestrates at lot of routine Hollywood BS and cover-ups.

Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job doing a stereotype caricature of a rich, spoiled, over-rated, over-egotistical mega-movie-star bitch who's obviously supposed to remind us of Julia Roberts. Reportedly, the Gwen Harrison role was offered to Julia Roberts, but she turned it down out of fear that people would think that was the real Julia Roberts. Hmmmmm.....

Yes, you have to admit--people are very gullible and easily leaden. They need to believe that this unnaturally perfect life exists. Otherwise, what would their escape from the dreary and depressing, soul-and-bone crushing society be? If anyone ever believe Roberts to be a over-egotistical-pumped-up monster like Gwen in this movie.... her fan-base would dry-up and so would her career.

With all the flavor-of-the-month celebrities out there, Roberts is one of the few, precious to have any real staying power. Don't rock the boat, Jules. The only actress I could imagine could pull the villainous heartless bitch movie-starlet off as good as Roberts would be Amanda Peet, who's sort of become a staple of weird, bizarre, off-kilter romantic comedies (""The Whole Nine Yards,"" ""Saving Silverman"" and ""Whipped""). Maybe she would have been better than Zeta-Jones. Perhaps it would have been best to not sign Roberts up, as she seems unbelievable as a wall-flower-turned-blossomed rose.

But there is an entire mainstream religion of mindless moronic lemmings who would leap off a cliff onto jagged rocks down below if anyone like Roberts had a life that was anything but wine and roses... and red-carpet Oscar-night bliss. Christopher Walken can always, always take a nothing movie... and suddenly make it all seem worth-while. And he actually manages to nearly resurrect this thing back from the dead as the Oscar-winning borderline psychotic-director Hal Weidmann (who seems to echo Kubrick).

Seth Green, usually a fiery actor, like everyone else, is dampened here. I remember thinking how much better this damn movie would be if lived up to all to the foreplay. The flick opens brilliantly. We're promised a satirical anti-dote to the brainless, bland, formulaic crap that Hollywood is dispensing. And they give us more of it. Practically, a love letter to it. We get screwed. We feel more cheated than Eddie. We're expecting some clever, well-written, merciless biting satire against Hollywood, mindless rom-coms with big-name stars in them, the film critics and journalists, and the fans who watch this garbage... And what do we get? Not an assault on the idiocy, but more of the idiocy itself. A golf ball hitting someone in the head, someone jamming a phone into a chair, a dog sniffing at someone's crotch, a guy falling onto a cactus crotch-first, fat people, etc.

Cheap sit-com crap you can see on the ABC Wedensday night family line-up or on any other sitcom on regular network television anytime. I kept asking myself: How could such talented people with such an inspired, brilliant premise be so bad... and boring? I went to""box office & business"" on IMDb and got my answer: The film's budget was an estimated $48,000,000. It grossed a whopping $93,607,673, and that's just in the US. Is it just me, or is everyone is this cast wearing a leather jacket? Actually, Zeta-Jones wears leather pants in one scene and so does Billy. Was there some kind of dress code on the set? How many cows were slain for this? How much time, talent and resource was wasted?

The film was awful because the writing was awful, and great actors (although slightly miscast) and good directing could not make up for something that just wasn't there.

Console yourself in watching classics for the actors in these movies instead: for Cusack, watch ""The Sure Thing""; for Roberts, ""Notting Hill""; for Walken, ""The King of New York""; for Zeta-Jones, ""Traffic"" and for Crystal, ""When Harry Met Sally.""

I really wish that this movie could have had a little less of Julia Roberts and John Cusack, and a little more of Billy's shenanigans like he does so delightfully during the Oscars.  Maybe he could have sung a few songs about Catherine Zeta Jones (and even made silly references to how old her husband--Michael Douglas--is), and done a snappy little dance.  That would have made this movie slightly more enjoyable.

But even though they didn't do that, I would pay money to see Julia Roberts fall in love with anything--even a plate of yams--because she is just so down-to-earth.  In real life I just know she's like any other normal person, because that's what she says to the paparazzi all the time.

1327525,4,B00003CY5F,"I know that alot people scarcely remember this movie, some may even want to forget that it exists, but this is a WONDERFUL movie! No, it's not perfect, the plot is so-so and the movie chugs along at a somewhat slow pace, but the one-liners and the cast are so great, that how can you NOT like this movie? John Cusack, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, Seth Green, Stanley Tucci, Hank Azaria, and Christopher Walken are part of this amazing cast and together they make up a wonderfully light-hearted little romantic comedy.

Crystal plays a wise studio exec who is getting fired from his job by the head honcho, Dave Kingman (Tucci), to be replaced by a kid who doesn't know much about the movie business (Green). Kingman wants one last favor: to reunite the ultimate Hollywood couple for one last junket, one last premiere, so he can make his millions off their movie. No junket, no money! It's Crystal's job to get them back together one more time. Big problems arise when trying to do this. Gwen (Zeta-Jones) wants nothing to do with her now-crazy ex-husband (Eddie) who is now living in a mental institution. But she knows that foregoing this junket could ruin her career, so she enlists her sister Kiki (Roberts) to help pull it all together. Eddie is still hung up on his ex-wife, until he begins to see Kiki in an entirely new way.

Lots of funny lines in the movie. Very dry comedy, not quite your typical romantic comedy. Lots of colorful characters, no questions are left unanswered, so take a glimpse into what Hollywood is probably like, direct from Billy Crystal himself (he co-wrote the movie, afterall!)

Who has loved him all her life, but was left in the shadow and wake of her star sister.

Its a movie of finding your true self, and that love if looked for can heal even the most despairing of hearts. In a comical way, having Billy Crystal as Cupid, the man who only wanted to make the couple famous, and ended up giving John Cusack the world.

This was a wonderful movie, romantic, sweet and comical. If you love Billy Crystal, John Cusack or Julia Roberts this will be sure to please.",1114905600,19,762,4.435714285714286
1327531,2,B00003CY5F,"Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas (Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack) are famous actors who are married to each other and also have made nine films together. Six of those films grossed over $100 million, so when they break up, all of their fans are heartbroken. Eddie is very distraught and turns to a guru (Alan Arkin) for help. Gwen turns to a new boyfriend (Hank Azaria), a Spaniard looking to break into the business big time. But Gwen's last two films didn't do well, so the studio is even more anxious to get Gwen and Eddie together to promote the last film they made together, `Time Over Time'. The studio chief (Stanley Tucci) calls in the only man he knows who can pulls this off, Lee (Billy Crystal). Lee, the recently fired studio publicist. Lee knows that there is only one person who can help him, Kiki (Julia Roberts), Gwen's sister and assistant. Lee immediately sets up a junket in a new resort outside of Las Vegas.

""America's Sweethearts"" is the latest film directed by Joe Roth. Roth directed a few mediocre films (among them `Coupe de Vile') and then started his own film production company. For a few years, he was the head of Disney Studios and now he has started another production company called ""Revolution Studios"". His new company has attracted a lot of top-name talent. Roth, for some reason, decided to direct this film based on a screenplay by Crystal and Peter Tolan. They also wrote ""Analyze This"". The film has a lot of good-sounding things going for it. Great cast (for the most part). Great premise. Promising screenwriters. But why does it feel like a cheap television movie? I have to place most of the blame for this on Roth's shoulders. The direction is so bland it just reeks of television movie of the week. Nothing inspires the viewer.

Another element of this television mow syndrome is the music. Music is played over everything. Many pop songs are played over parts of scenes, into the beginning of the next scene. Usually music is included in a film to cue the audience's emotions, but if a song is playing over two scenes, how is that supposed to work?

The story leads up to a screening of the last film Eddie and Gwen made. The director (Christopher Walken) has ideas of his own and shows a film that he created. The film is not funny. The buildup leads to nothing, creating an extremely unfunny climax.

Julia Roberts is obviously the star of the film and her role is pleasant, but not great. As Kiki, she plays her sister's handmaiden. In a few brief flashbacks, we see Kiki as an overweight woman. These scenes had the promise of delivering something that Julia's fans could remember, but they are all too brief. Julia is a mega-star and can't spend a lot of screen time in a fat suit. Her relationship with John Cusack is slightly interesting to watch, but I never got the feeling that they were madly in love. Shouldn't they have been madly in love? It is a romance after all.

Billy Crystal has a few funny lines, but they have the feel of ancient history to them. Even the most novice person has some knowledge of how the studios and Hollywood work. The jokes had little originality to them.

Catherine Zeta- Jones is just awful. Every single line sounds like it is simply being spoken by Catherine Zeta- Jones. The only time she even appears to be attempting a character is when Gwen is acting especially shallow or callous. Gwen is an unlikable person, but Zeta- Jones doesn't take this to a new level. We have seen this character a million times before and with more interesting results.

John Cusack plays Eddie Thomas. Eddie is a confused man and this makes his character more interesting, but I just didn't believe that he was ever in love with either Gwen or Kiki. John Cusack is capable of such better work.

Christopher Walken, Stanley Tucci, Seth Green and Alan Arkin pop up for various cameos, and these generate a few chuckles, but overall, they are completely forgotten by the time the film ends.

""America's Sweethearts"" is a film that is so calculated that it makes me uneasy. The subject matter is meant to be cute, to appeal to as many people as possible. For this reason, they have to shy away from anything resembling reality in the relationships. People in Peoria might object if Julia Roberts looks fat, or if they actually have a fight with some substance, or if anything appeared to have an `edge' to it.

""America's Sweethearts"" is best viewed on Fox, when it appears during the Spring of 2002. This way, you can view the film in the medium best suited for it, as a television movie of the week.",1113264000,2,4576,4.603680981595092
1327582,1,B00003CY5F,"You would think that a movie with such a star studded cast would have some redeeming qualities but this one does not. The characters are flat and provide no reason for the audience to become emotionally attached. Zeta-Jones self centered starlet character is terrible and drab, John Cusacks depressed and lonely character is unbelievable and impossible to become attached to, Billy Crystal's press agent who tries to please everyone character is not funny nore engaging and Julia Robert's character seems to only be present because she has a big smile. The high point, if you can call it that is Hank Azaria's foreign lover character. His character is horribly stereotypical yet at least he does a bit of acting by talking in an accent (even if the accent is overdone). Even Christopher Walken, who is good in just about anything is lost in this movie. His small role of movie maker doesn't even make any sense - there is nothing at all in the movie that gives hints to the ending in which Walken's character plays a large role.

The main point of the movie - will Zeta-Jone's character and John Cusack's character get back together? - is completely lost because they simply have no amount of chemistry together on screen. Their acting is completely flat.

This movie is disappointing even when compared to all the other bad romantic comedies out there.

One last note - the running Doberman gag would maybe be funny and appropriate to third graders if it weren't for the fact that Crystal's character appears to enjoy being licked in the crotch by a dog. He even tells the dog where to lick. That's not funny - it's just disturbing.",1111622400,3,1633,4.742957746478873
1327583,1,B00003CY5F,"America's Sweethearts borrows a leaf from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's infamous break-up, not to mention stealing the basic plot from Singing In The Rain. Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) are famous actors who were married to each other. They have starred as romantic couples in numerous successful movies (incidentally, the film opens with ""excerpts"" from these movies, and they appear to be spoofs of scenes from real films such as the New York autumn walk in the park scene from When Harry Met Sally, Trinity waking up Neo with a kiss in The Matrix, etc.).

However, they have now broken up and are not doing too well alone. Eddie is holed up in some new age recovery clinic, and has been legally restrained from approaching Gwen, due to an unfortunate incident involving Eddie riding a bike straight into a restaurant where Gwen was dining along with her new Spanish lover Hector (Hank Azaria). By the way, the scene of Eddie in the rain just before he gets on the bike looks like it's a spoof of Bladerunner. If you are starting to get the impression this film contains a lot of spoofs of other films then you are correct.

 Gwen, on the other hand, has been making several movies since the break-up which have all bombed at the box office. She goes on the Larry King Live talkback show, and the audience keep ringing to tell her they wish she and Eddie would get back together again.

So, enter Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal), studio publicist extraordinaire, except he's just been fired by the studio head Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci). He is busy packing up and handing his role to apprentice successor Danny Wax (Seth Green), when Kingman abruptly begs him to come back.

Reclusive eccentric director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken) is holding the final print of his latest film (""Time Over Time"") hostage and refuses to show it to anyone before the press junket promoting the film. This film also happens to be the last film starring Eddie and Gwen prior to their break-up, so needless to say Kingman desperately wants it at any cost.

  Lee's job is to organise the press junket and to cover up the fact that the film is missing and no one knows what it's like. He gets bonus points if he can somehow convince the public that Eddie and Gwen are getting back together again, or at least thinking about it.

He enlists the help of Gwen's sister Kiki (Julia Roberts) who is Gwen's downtrodden much abused ""assistant"" as well as her sister. He manage to get them to agree to show up at the press junket, and he organises a set of ""distractions"" to keep the press occupied until the film arrives.

Will Eddie and Gwen actually get back together again? Or will Eddie fall for Kiki? And, why is Weidmann so mysteriously coy about the new film?

Given that this film is co-written and co-produced by Billy Crystal (who is obviously cashing in on his experience hosting one Grammy awards night after another), as well as featuring a star-studded cast, it's quite surprising how disappointing the film really is. The laughs are few and far in between, and most of the situations look awkward and contrived, not to mention boring in places. Although the film has a few twists, the ending is pretty obvious. Verdict? A missed opportunity and a waste of some good talent",1105488000,,3304,4.698961937716263
1327584,3,B00003CY5F,"He also wrote, produced, and starred in this. I'm surprised, I didn't think he could do three things at once! The scene where he basically gets molested by a Doberman, is the worst bit of the whole movie. It's like toilet humour - it's cheap and not in the least bit funny.

I bought this film mainly because I got a 2 off voucher, which had no ""use by"" date on it, so I thought I'd better use it quick smart. So I bought the first film I saw, and got it for 3.99. It looks like the nice little rom-com that I would normally buy, and hence the reason why my DVD case is bursting at the seams with these things.

There are a surprising number of terrific stars in this, and who saves this is Hank Azaria, in a fantastic role once more. Although he doesn't show off that amazing body of his (as seen in Along Came Polly). Julia Roberts is playing her usual role, although she chose not to go for the lead role - despite still getting star billing. I was NOT keen on John Cusack - he just doesn't do it for me, and every time he's on screen, you can feel yourself wanting to scratch the TV, just to make yourself feel better. He does have one of the best lines in the movie though: when Billy Crystal is trying to explain to him why Catherine has far bigger accommodations at the hotel, he asks: ""Well, she has an entourage ... you don't have an entourage."" Cusack responds: ""I""m a paranoid schizophrenic, I'm my OWN entourage.""

Catherine Zeta Jones plays herself fantastically - you can almost imagine that she's this much of a madam in real life! Christopher Walken also appears in a surprising, unkempt, and almost chubby role, and despite not having as much screen time as the others, he portrays the part of a pretentious director perfectly.

The finale is a great surprise, when the completed film is finally revealed, and brings a lot of laughs. The ending was too sickly sweet for my liking - you get the feeling Kiki (Julia Roberts) is getting her sister's tainted goods. I wouldn't feel right with that. Knowing your own sister has been there before you, whether the guy is comparing you two etc.

This is a reasonable film, despite the fact it was written by Billy Crystal - I'm sure he could write much better. Just for the film being shown to the stars and the press is worthwhile seeing. It's just a shame, that if you don't like these kinda movies, you have to sit through the rest of it first.",1093392000,,2407,4.34

Although they have been living apart for a year, are going to be divorced, and try to avoid each other, Zeta-Jones and Cusack both star in a movie which the movie's producer is anxious to earn big bucks from. Billy Cristal is the PR guy hired by the movie's producer to encourage (let's say, ""dupe"") Zeta-Jones and Cusack into making a star appearance at the film's premiere and he also orchestrates a series of ""scandals"" for the reporters and tabloids, just to make more money (as they say, no publicity is bad publicity, or something like that.) In the process, Zeta-Jones and Cusack end up in all sorts of funny, embarassing circumstances which they both try very desperately to extricate themselves from.
Cusack is not at his best, but he's entertaining. Roberts is looking good (and I wonder if she did really put on all that weight for this movie, cos it looks so real!). Zeta-Jones is stunning and ever-so-convincing in these diva roles.

He executes the role in a wonderful way.  I don't think that any other actor could have played the role any better.
Julia Roberts was wonderful too.  I had never really seen her as the ""sweet"" one before in a movie.  She is like Cinderella in a way.  She plays Gwens's sister Kiki and basically does everything for her.  I loved her in this movie.
Catherine was as usual, spectacular.  She plays the vixen so well!  That kind of role seems to fit her quite well, at least from what I have seen in ""Chicago"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty.""
Billy Crystal.  What can I say about him except he's great!  Stanley Tucci was quite funny too as the executive.  And I loved Seth Green's character.  He was just goofy.  But in a good way.

I also loved Chrisopher Walken.  You would expect him to play this really dark, creepy guy, but instead, he doesn't.  He's very...interesting.  I won't give it away.

Catherine Zeta-Jones shines as Gwen, the overdemanding much- lauded starlet, and John Cusack is brilliant as Eddie Thomas, her estranged husband and former co-star.  Julia Roberts taking a role somewhat in the shadows, is perfect as Gwen's sister, Kiki, whose life is devoted to satisfying every want and whim of Gwen. Having seen Julia as Anna Scott ( Notting Hill ), it was refreshing to see her tackle a different type of character, one who lives in the shadows of the famous, but shines in her own right.

This is the story of Gwen and Eddie, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack.  They are starcrossed movie star ex-lovers who are forced to cross paths once again in the light of a promise to reunite them on the big screen.  The plan proves difficult as the screenwriter played by an under written Christopher Walken, is deranged.  Billy Crystal is their publicist of sorts and friend who advises and guides throughout with his usual shtick.  Julia Roberts is Gwens formerly fat and currently quasi-attractive crush addled sister.  Although she secretly loves Eddie,  he doesn't know she's alive UNTIL, well you have to see it yourself.

 I don't know why everyone here thinks this is so terrible, I found it quite entertaining from beginning to end.  Julia Roberts, well she is who she is, and has never been a Pretty Woman in my opinion, or anyone deserving of the hoopla she has had.  Who cares?  This is a fun film that moves quickly and kept my interest with a simple and breezy plot.  Must everyone get mired in pretentious and complicated films?? I for one, have had enough of those!

Role of funniest belongs to Hank Azzaria as Gwens lisping latin beefcake boytoy with a heavy spanish accent.  Admittedly Hank being the hot handsome latin macho type is a tremendous reach,  but have you ever heard him do a Spanish lisp?  Quite amusing, particularly in the restaurant showdown with Cusack over Zeta-Jones.

With the exception of a disappointing lack of a role for veteran master Christopher Walken,  sorely wasted here as a deranged screenwriter in charge of the script for the comeback film venue, I think this film is well worth a look.  Just seeing Julia Roberts all blowsy and frumpy in horn rim glasses and a fat suit ALONE is worth the price of the rental!  Don't you agree?",1044921600,,1918,4.716867469879518

1327657,3,B00003CY5F,"Wow, what a misfire.  There are to key lines in this movie, one delivered by Julia Robert's character Kathleen ""Kiki"" Harrison to John Cusack's Eddie Thomas (I think one sign that a romantic comedy is in trouble is when she gets top billing and he is listed fourth), and the other by Billy Crystal's publicity guru Lee Phillips.  Both lines on the printed page look great.  Both lines as delivered in the film fall flat.  To add insult to injury, after watching the movie I checked out the trailer and both lines score in the trailer (the benefit of much better editing than we get in the film).  But ""America's Sweethearts"" is one of those films where not only is the trailer better than the film, the film within the film, directed by Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken) is better than the film.
The titular couple in this film are the aforementioned Eddie Thomas and his apparently soon to be ex-wife Gwen Harrison, played by Catharine Zeta-Jones.  The script by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan plays off of several famous celebrity relationships, so that when we learn Gwen has left Eddie for her Spanish lover, Hector Gorgonzolas (played by the usually reliable Hank Anzaria in a performance over the top and out of place in the film), we are reminded of Melanie Griffith leaving Don Johnson for Antonio Banderas.  When you become bored with this film you can certainly divert your mind by coming up with other guesses as to who the characters are ""really"" supposed to be.  Anyhow, the plot is that Gwen and Eddie have been bombing in films ever since they broke up and the studio has sent Lee Phillips out to get them back together to save their latest film ""Time Over Time,"" made with Zen crackpot director Weidmann (think Tom and Nicole slaving for Kubrick in London for over a year).  Is Eddie over Gwen?  Or will he notice that her sister Kiki has lost 60 pounds and turned into Julia Roberts?
What?  You thought this was a SUSPENSE film?
I like John Cusak, but I keep thinking he is too young for either of the women in this film.  Roberts successfully dims her wattage for the most point but her character never really clicks, beyond the fact she is played by Julia Roberts.  But I am even more perplexed by the idea that this is a film written by Billy Crystal that is not particularly funny.  Walken steals the film as soon as he shows up although Zeta-Jones surprisingly offers the best comic timing and performance in the film.

But what is a definite standout in this movie, that pokes fun at the whole business of movie making and the promotions, is Catherine Zeta-Jones.  She does a terrific turn as a much beloved movie star who is just a witch of a real person on the other side.  Roberts plays her sister/assistant who takes care of her every whim through it all.  John Cusack is Zeta-Jones' husband, and has played opposite him in all these movies that have made them the talk of the town and the toast of Tinseltown.  America loves them, but they no longer love each other, and Zeta-Jones wants a divorce.  Enter Billy Crystal who needs to promote the last picture they made.....he gets the two to agree to play nice one last time for the sake of the movie and sales and their adoring fans, and it gets sticky, and stickier.  But Roberts' loves Cusack?!
It's very funny, and has many more stars in the film than just these three.....Christopher Walken, Seth Green, Alan Arkin, Stanley Tucci, Hank Azaria, and Larry King all add to the story with their own style and flair.  I do disagree with the PG-13 rating at times though, there's some heavy references to sex.  The DVD has a few deleted scenes with commentary from Joe Roth, the director, that are fun to watch and add a bit to the movie.  But there is no additional commentary track to the entire movie and there is no real other extras to speak of.  So the film stands alone on my five star rating.

For me it was a great treat watching Billy. Billy has this sarcastic criticism about the Entertainment Industry - and life overall - that is so close to things I have said about people, places and things that I often wonder if he is following me recording my thoughts! He is hysterical!
Now - as far as the film goes....it has a pretty big cast - John Cussack (16 Candles, Say Anything, The Grifters) and Cathrine Zeta Jones (The Mask Of Zorro, the new Chicago, The Haunting) do a great job as the `Hollywood Couple' gone wrong. Except for the public eye and the personalities on camera - off camera they are `oil and water'. Cathrine character is support by the hysterically funny and often underrated Hank Azaria (The Birdcage, Godzilla, Anastasia) as her Cuban lover. He is a scene-stealer! Here's another talent that needs o be given a chance. Through it all, Billy Crystal's character, the publicist (who also has a sidekick - cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich). Quite a cast, right?
Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see); Christopher Walkin (Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, Mouse Hunt) There is comedy, slapstick, farce and more. A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!
Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines - like - `...oh look, there's the buffet..."" and many many, more! Stanley Tucci (A Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Pelican Brief, Road To Perdition) gives a fantastic performance as the typical Hollywood Producer gone panicked.
The DVD extras include the usual trailer and previews and there is also a special section with deleted scenes where there is a limited on camera commentary with director Jo Roth. The bad part is that it is the only commentary on the DVD. It would have been nice to have the commentary on the whole feature film - this was a big disappointment to me. Overall I loved the movie.

Why, then, is so much of the show flat? Maybe it's the direction, although I can't really think of any massive flaws.

Billy Crystal is a good choice for the publicist role.  Well, he wrote the script and he may have tailored made this part for himself.  At least he knew what worked for him.
John Cusack: a great actor with off beat comic timing.  But he's totally out of sync with the rest of the cast here.  I tend to believe he did this one for $ and for the chance to work with Julia and Company.
Catherine Zeta-Jones: a beautiful woman with meat and curve on her body (a very realistic womanly woman).  But this seems like a reprise from her supporting role in ""High Fidelity"", the same self-serving, selfish, and egotistic character.  She's getting too good at playing this kind of woman.  Makes me wonder if she's like this in real life.  :)  A big plus is for us to have a peak at her upcoming role in ""Chicago"".
Julia Roberts: boy what can I say?  She's got charisma and she can't hide it.  So to play a role with mousy hair and fat suit is just not convincing to me.

What could've gone wrong with America's Sweethearts? It had funny guy Billy Crystal writing and performing, America's real sweetheart Julia Roberts in the main lead, and two of the hottest stars around today, Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack. But somehow, someway the critics hated this movie. I don't really see why. I mean, sure, America's Sweethearts had problems, but overall it was a funny, interesting movie that showed possible outcomes of movie making and stardom, and I enjoyed it.
The best thing about the movie is the cast and their characters. Roberts is obviously calming things down a little after her big Oscar win, and she is charming in an easy role. Crystal's character is a frantic but calm man, and he does well performing as usual. Zeta-Jones has never being my favourite actress (she was in Entrapment and The Haunting! In the same year!) but in this movie she didn't bother me too much. Her character is pretty bitchy and Zeta-Jones plays her the right way. Cusack is the only problem in the leading four, he is not his usual unique, quirky self. He looks bored with the role and his voice is constantly telling us he can do better.
The movie had some standout comical scenes. It was very funny to see Roberts as a little fatty, and I also enjoyed the scenes where Crystal was getting unusually close to a dog. The outcome of the ""movie"" the characters were making is also quite funny. There is some silly wanna-be funny scenes, such as Cusack on the top of a roof suicide-style (just taking a ""breather?"") and Christopher Walken's questionable casting as the annoying director.
I liked the sneaky music in the film too. It suited the Hollywood setting very well, and composer James Newton Howard does typically well. I especially liked the music in the scene were Crystal is running back and forth between cars, giving messages from Zeta-Jones and Cusack to each other after their break-up. In fact, Crystal is the best part of the movie, he delivers the best lines and I enjoyed his screen presence the most. I look forward to him been in the comic leading-man seat again, and he also proves himself once again as an excellent writer.
This is predictable and stupid in some ways, but is quite an expert at giving us the real deal in Hollywood because, after all, it is Hollywoodians who wrote the film. I congratulate America's Sweethearts on being an easy-on-the-eyes and enjoyable romantic comedy that finally doesn't just take the easy way out all the time. This is something different and I think there is something for everyone in here. So don't always trust the critics, because you might enjoy the fun and light-hearted atmosphere of America's Sweethearts. It's not perfect by a long shot, but I can guarantee you'll smile or laugh at least once. In the long run, just don't expect too much and you have a good chance of enjoying America's Sweethearts.

The real curiosity of the film, though, is that those doing the satirizing are the biggest Hollywood names of today--Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, John Cusack, Christopher Walken and Stanley Tucci. Sure they know the business and undoubtedly have more than a few tales to tell; but those tales aren't told here. Only Walken's part has any real bite to it, and that is dampered by the storyline in which we see only the first five minutes of his ""honest"" film--made with hidden cameras during the apparent filming of a standard bit of sci-fi nonsense. Here, where America's Sweethearts has the opportunity to let loose a little, it pointedly does not.

After the first round of my friends saw it and panned it, I held off seeing it in the theater and got it on DVD.  My intuition was right.
It's not that this is a bad movie, it's just not up to par with other JR movies.  Maybe because her character was given second billing.. I don't particularly care for Catherine Zeta Jones, and the part she played in this movie didn't help.  Thankfully, though the makers alluded to Julia Roberts' character having lost a lot of weight, they didn't subject us to her in a fat suit a la Gwyneth Paltrow.. like anyone would ever believe, even in a movie, that Julia would ever be less than beautiful.
Given that the movie had a lot of star power in it (JR, CZ-J, Billy Crystal, John Cusack) it was just a bit of a bad use of the typical Julia Roberts romantic comedy.

1327845,2,B00003CY5F,"You'd think Hollywood would have no problem making a movie about Hollywood. Think again. True, there have been some great pictures in which Hollywood looks at itself. The oldest one I can think of is 1937's A Star is Born, which was remade as an even better movie in 1954. 1950's Sunset Boulevard is one of the greatest movies ever made, and a few years later came Singin' in the Rain, a classic musical. Yet, over the years, the industry has produced more bad movies about itself than good ones. America's Sweethearts falls somewhere in-between. Its beginning is quite promising, but it falters and goes downhill after that.
Lee [Billy Crystal] is a Hollywood press agent with big problems. His boss, Dave [Stanley Tucci], needs him to promote the newest move starring Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas [Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack]. The pair used to be the hottest, most popular married couple in America, and the public flocked to see their movies. Now that they are on the verge of divorce and can't stand the sight of each other, they are boxoffice poison. Lee must figure out a way to convince the press that Gwen and Eddie are getting back together without letting the two stars know what he is up to. He enlists the aid of Gwen's sister, Kiki [Julia Roberts], who not only resents the way Gwen orders her around but is also secretly in love with Eddie. Then there is the problem of the movie itself. All the studio has seen of it is the opening credits. The director [Christopher Walken] doesn't want to show it until he's made some changes. These modifications will result in a movie quite unlike the one the studio paid 86 million dollars to make.
Reading the above synopsis makes me see how funny and insightful America's Sweethearts might have been. The plot leaves ample room for both farce and satire, but the writers didn't take advantage of the opportunity. Instead of being bright, brittle and insightful, the story is instead cute, cloying and tame. Most of the chances for Hollywood to laugh at itself are wasted. So is Julia Roberts. As much as I have finally come to respect her, I just don't think she's right in a plain-Jane role. Also, she has done the ugly duckling into a swan routine too many times before. The movie is primarily a vanity project for Billy Crystal, who also produced it, and for director Joe Roth, who used it to launch his new company, Revolution Studios. They probably were afraid to upset the Hollywood establishment, of which they are a part, too much.
If your mind wanders while watching a movie, it usually means it isn't grabbing you. There are several scenes in America's Sweethearts where a character says something and everyone in the room gasps. I started thinking about this. In my entire life, I have never known anyone ever to say anything that made all the listeners gasp, and I've known some pretty racy people. This is something that happens only in the movies. Then, I started to list in my head of other things you see only on celluloid. Before I knew it, the movie was over.",1015891200,7,3044,4.659851301115242

Although the female actors had an opportunity to capitalize on their relationship with one another (despite the ridiculous plot-which is so forgettable, thank God), Julia Roberts plays like she's taking a break from her busy acting career and Catherine Zeta Jones makes no effort to add MUCH-needed charisma or sympathy to her character. As for John Cussack...well, he just seems to be caught in the middle. The token male.
American Sweethearts could have passed for believable, or funny, or not so stupid. There were no redeemable qualities. The director wasn't able to get anything out of his actors and to be honest I don't think the actors even tried, or cared.

1327849,3,B00003CY5F,"Audience's instinct always tells that whenever bankable stars share the screen, it means money.  And this movie's title is audaciously straightforward ""America's Sweethearts.""  I thought the honor belongs exclusively to Mary Pickford.
To be fair, ""America's Sweethearts"" is not a total mess; it gives some funny moments here and there, thanks to writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan (the latter also co-wrote the script of ""Analyse This"".)  You can easily find Billy Crystaliam, just like in ""When Harry Met Sally..."", and incredibly unpredictable Christopher Walken, whose wacky  performance gets wackier every year, appears the wackiest film director, Hal Weidmann.  He is simply great ... sort of.
But the romance part of the film is so weak, and it lacks power to convince us that Julia's character really 1) falls in love with a star John Cusack plays; 2) can endure her impossible sister for years.  After all, we see standard Julia again, and charming as she is, she is doing the same thing after all.  Her portrayal of Anna Scott in ""Notting Hill"" was more credible and memorable for her spontaneous and natural charms.  (How come they decided to put her into a special make-up to make her look fat?  This is not ""Shallow Hal,"" isn't this?)  As to Cathrine Zeta Jones, she plays an egoistic, selfish superstar pretty well, but it's still one-note performance and that's all.  After all, haven't we all seen or heard those behaviors of Hollywood stars anyway?
This is the product from Revolution Studios established by the director Joe Roth, whose career as producer is far more outstanding than as director.  (His last job as director was more than 10 years ago.  One interesting fact is that Mr. Roth, married to Donna Arkoff Ross, is son-in-law of Samuel Z Arkoff, legendary producer of famous movie company AIP, which made many exploitation films during the 50-70s.)  This fact may suggest one aspect of the ""America's Sweethearts""; ""name"" stars dominate the film, not the skill of director.  But if you like Julia, you won't complain from the beginning.
Not exactly effective as a romantic comedy, ""American Sweethearts"" still brings some laughs though, I guess,  the movie-within-movie ""Time After Time"" (later changed ""Blair B---- Project"") must be by far funnier than this one.",1015372800,,2293,5.074666666666666

1327902,1,B00003CY5F,"Nothing is so unfunny as when Hollywood tries to poke fun at itself and the pathetic state of Hollywood marriages. That producer Billy Crystal chose to cast himself gives a clue to how truly bad the film is.
When the perfect star couple Gwen and Eddie, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cuisak, publically break up over on-screen infidelities, Crystal's role as studio publicist is to bring the two stars together for the film's press preview. Crystal turns to Gwen's plain-Jane sister, Kiki (Julia Roberts) to make sure the tempermental, self-absorbed, shallow highness appears for the out of town junket. Heartbroken Cuisak, on the verge of a holistic nervous breakdown, is the secret crush of Kiki, but he is too distracted by his own neurotic behavior to see that Kiki, despite her 60 lbs. weight loss, is the perfect woman for him. The audience is expected to see the humor of the mismatched pair of Eddie and Kiki, but never for a moment do we believe that Julia Roberts in a fat suit is still not Julia Roberts, beautiful, svelt, and flashing the Oscar-winning Colgate smile of smiles in bad lighting and little makeup.
Adding to the muddle is Stanley Tucci, a studio executive who would rather have his leading man commit on-camera suicide if it would sell the picture, and in the most obnoxious role of a career, Hank Azaria, as a lisping Spaniard that recalls a bad Antonio Bandaras impersonation.
What is almost comedic is to realize in hindsight that these characters easily can pass for the real marrige-go-bust of Tom, Nicole, and Penelope, and It-girl Julia breaking up with her then Latino hunk, Ben as soon as the Best Oscar was in hand.
 Were it not for how unfunny the film's premise makes of the Hollywood celebrity machine, studio marketing system, and publicity mongers whose role is to put spin on unsympathetic personalities like Gwen, Eddie, Kiki, and their entourage, the film might have an iota of laughter, but the laughs are cheap.

With Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, John Cusack, and Stanley Tucci, I expected a pleasant romantic comedy.  What I saw was a jumbled mess of a movie.  To start with, every successful romantic comedy has a relationship at its core that you believe in.  If not, you've already lost the audience.  Never once did I believe that Julia's and John's characters possessed a spark.  This is one of those movies that the director is asking you to trust that all the feelings are legitimate while they throw nothing at you that builds on this.  Yes, I love John Cusack and Julie Roberts.  It is a great match that is wasted in this film.  Given the very satisfactory body of their work, I'll let this film pass, but jeez what a waste.  Worse yet is the casting of Hank Azaria, who is slowly but surely suffering from Tracey Ullman disease which deludes an actor into thinking they can perform as any broad characture to comic effect.  Hey Hank, how about just acting.  Given his upcoming series on TV that has him portraying multiple characters, I suppose the lesson has yet to be learned.  Even the conclusion was hackneyed.

1327905,3,B00003CY5F,"When you compare America's Sweethearts to it's potential, it comes out as not a very good movie.  It was a big budget major studio release in the summer with a star-studded cast.  While this movie doesn't live up to the hype of a summer blockbuster, it is still quite amusing and entertaining.
The problem with the movie is its casting.  Julia Roberts plays the sister to the famous, selfish star (Catherite Zeta Jones Douglas.)  It is hard to believe Roberts as an unknown sister who isn't really famous, especially since she is probably the most famous female star today, and after seeing her in Notting Hill where she plays a famous movie star.
I don't think John Cusack makes a good leading man.  His character has to many flaws that make it hard to believe that he can just turn his life around and make sane decisions when it comes to falling in love.
Still, this movie has its good points.  Christopher Walken, Billy Crystal and Hank Azaria are all funny in their roles.  The story is good and the ending is believable, but the characters could have used some work.
Some say this movie was a Hollywood satire.  I don't think it is because I don't know enough about Hollywood to make a judgement.  But does have many amusing moments, just not enough to make it a quality summer blockbuster.",1009756800,,1296,4.575757575757576
1327906,2,B00003CY5F,"and put them in a hastily done film which, in trying to be a satire, cannot succeed because the humor is too weak and the plot too familiar.  If America's Sweethearts was trying for romantic comedy, not only was the comedy missing, but there was zero screen chemistry between Roberts/Cusack, Zeta-Jones/Cusack, Zeta-Jones/Azaria....just no real connection.
Zeta-Jones lights up the screen with her beauty, but her gift for light touches (The Mask of Zorro) in her comedy romances is missing here.  She is believable as a Hollywood diva, because she is just such a pain.  Roberts has been ""dulled down"" to fit her character, Kiki, the Cinderella of the story.  She's got no guts with Zeta-Jones, and is completely unbelievable as the object of Cusack's affections.  Cusack is just all right - his addiction to his various medications and his waffling on whether or not he loves or hates Zeta-Jones are overplayed.  Crystal tries too hard throughout the film.  I believe he had a strong hand in writing and producing it, so you know why he is trying so hard.
Christopher Walken is too over the top as a Howard Hughes type director, but Hank Azaria, also way, way over the top as a Spanish bit player with a lisping accent, gives us the same great touch with comedy we've seen in many of his films and in his characterization of the dog-walker on ""Mad About You"".  Azaria is terrific, but there is far too little of him on the screen, and one of the outtakes, with him in a bathtub, should have been retained in the editing of the film.
Alan Arkin does a cameo as Cusack's psychiatrist.  It is worth seeing the film for, showing the cutting edge that Billy Crystal has displayed for outrageous comedy in prior films.

America's Sweethearts is a movie that rolls around like it's building up a foundation to a real film, like something that is shoved into an editing process but is never completed, but by the time you think that just maybe, this movie will go somewhere, the 100 minutes are over and you're leaving the room in disbelief.
 The cast has undeniable talent, and SHOULD have you blown away by their ability. Unfortunately, Billy Crystal, who was one of the screenwriters on the project, wrote his part way too big and tries to steal the show. This wouldn't be so bad, if, the supporting cast didn't act the same way. Julia Roberts has a much smaller part than the trailers let you belive, as well as Catherine Zeta-Jones. Take one of these stars, make it their movie, this whole movie would be a lot more enjoyable. Sadly, it becomes too obvious just how badly America's Sweethearts wants to be the modern Singin' In the Rain.

Personally, I thought the story line was riduculous and didn't have any real depth.  She (Roberts) was interviewed about wearing the ""fat suit"" and she was talking about how awful it was.  I thought ""hey, this is going to be cool because she is branching out into new territory"".  Wrong.  She is only seen in the fat suit for a short period of time during the movie, to the point where you probably wouldn't have even noticed it if the media hadn't made such a big deal about it.  I was very disappointed.  I collect Julia Roberts movies and I don't think I will waste the time to buy it.  I can't see this being one that I would watch again.

It is a story of two formerly married stars that made numerous successful films together, but have now separated.  Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a pouty and manipulative shrew who left her husband and co-star Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) to cavort with her Spanish lover Hector (Hank Azaria).  They must come together to promote the last film they made together before the breakup.  Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) is the studio's representative assigned the task of promoting the film with the help of Kiki Harrison (Julia Roberts), Gwen's sister and agent.  Together they must create the illusion that Eddie and Gwen are still America's Sweethearts.
The screenplay was written by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan (""The Larry Sanders Show"", ""Analyze This"", ""Bedazzled"").  One can almost tell which scenes are written by whom.  Most of Billy Crystal's scenes are obviously written by him (probably improvisationally on the set) in his deadpan sarcastic and ironic style.  These are generally the funniest scenes in the film.  However, much of the film just drags on attempting to be funny, but clumsily laying egg after egg.  The way Eddie is written, he is just a bit too pathetic and Gwen is simply abrasive.  The ""surprise"" ending by eccentric director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken) is more bizarre than comical.
Director Joe Roth is better known as a producer than a director, and despite having a terrific cast, he can't deliver comic consistency.  The best comedy is delivered by Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts and Hank Azaria, who steals every scene he is in with his hilarious Spaniard impersonation.  Crystal and Roberts are both veterans of the romantic comedy and together they form a solid base for the film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a terrific dramatic actress, but just doesn't have the comic timing for this project.  She overdoes her character's whimpering obnoxiousness to the point where it isn't at all funny.  John Cusack is always good at playing the hapless soul, but his character is such a loser that Cusack has difficulty breathing much life into him.  Hank Azaria is fantastic as the lisping Latin lover.  Every time it seemed that the film was losing its edge, Azaria pulled it from the fire with another hysterical scene.  Christopher Walken is also excellent as the whacked out director of the Eddie and Gwen film.
Overall, this is a fair comedy with some very funny moments separated by long boring stretches.  I rated it a 6/10.",1008115200,4,2588,5.073286052009457

They both were the couple of the moment for a long time, and have since not had a movie hit on their own. Their studios are desperate for a hit and recently-fired PR superstar, Billy Crystal, is rehired to make them appear as a loving couple again on the verge of the launch of their last film together.

1327982,3,B00003CY5F,"Let's face it, when Julia Roberts does a romantic comedy, people can't help but go see it.  After shooting to superstardom with Pretty Woman, Roberts slowly went downhill in the public's eye(save for Sleeping With The Enemy & The Pelican Brief) by opting for more serious film roles (Flatliners, Dying Young) and comedies (Ready To Wear, I Love Trouble)without a real working romance.  After doing unsuccessful films(and I mean that as they didn't make money) like Mary Reilly & Something To Talk About, Julia finally returned to her roots, so to speak, by starring in the romantic comedy, My Best Friend's Wedding.  It was a huge success for the actress and helped boost her career tremendously.  Other romantic comedies followed (Notting Hill, Runaway Bride) and were also very successful.  And with her Oscar winning role in Ellen Brockovitch, Julia was back on top.  America's Sweethearts is a nice addition to her romantic comedy repertoire, casting her in a role of a woman living in the shadow of her sister's success (played deliciously stuck up by Catherine Zeta Douglas, errr Jones :-) and thereby feeling that she herself is not all that special.  I think we like to see Julia in roles where she is very humble, even if the character is successful (like Notting Hill) or not (like this film), because we all know she's one of the most beautiful women on the planet, yet she has the ability to act very ordinary..even shy.  You never feel that she thinks she's truly better than everybody else, and that's a fine quality I wish more people could have.  I know John Cusack get's a lot of guff for always playing the role where he's somewhat of a loser or a burntout (he's been doing it since the early days with Say Anything & The Sure Thing), but I don't think you can say he's not good at it, what with all the practice.  There is a definate chemistry between him and Roberts that resonates throughout the picture.  The film is not afraid to poke fun at the movie industry, especially when a lot of the things depicted in the movie actually do happen in real life.  You have many actors who think they're premadonnas.  There's plenty of lying, cheating and stealing going on daily.  But the film just pokes fun at these issues, sometimes going way over the top in the process (John's supposed suicide attempt is one of them).  But with a movie like this all I can say is if you laugh most of the time and feel good when the two leads get together in the end, there's not much more you can ask for.  It's a great date movie too!  Go see it and enjoy.
The only dissapointment I had was with the DVD itself.  The extra features are quite few.  All you get are some deleted scenes (with an optional introduction by the director) that are pretty interesting (see what Hank Azaria was really doing in that bathtub :-).  A big scene of Christopher Walkin's daughter in the film (Leaf)is shown (she pretty much throws herself at Cusack), but was cut because it seemed to hurt John's character for some reason.  I noticed none of these deleted scenes involved Billy Crystal (it's good to be the writer and the producer :-).  But other than some theatrical trailers of the film, My Best Friend's Wedding & The Mask Of Zorro, you get nothing else.  And considering what Columbia/TriStar is charging for the DVD you do feel a bit cheated.  It's way above the price range of what a DVD with few extra features would be sold for.  I just hope they don't start acting like Paramount Pictures (the biggest DVD scrooges of them all!).  My advice is to grab this movie while it's on sale.  And Colunbia/TriStar...you'd do well to bring these prices down.

1327984,4,B00003CY5F,"Where can you find Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Hank Azaria in the same place? Here, in the movie America's Sweethearts. The initial premise of a married couple (John Cusack and Catherine Zea-Jones)garnering the country's attention by making movies together is a little loose, considering our cynical view on Hollywood, but thankfully, the story doesn't focus on them. Instead, it focuses on a budding relationship between John Cusack's character and Julia Robert's character. Every character gives an exciting performance that keeps the movie moving along without any slack.

1327985,4,B00003CY5F,"The plot is typical romantic comedy fare and pretty much delivers exactly what you expect.  Catherine Zeta Jones and John Cusak play an estranged Hollywood couple whose careers have suffered since their split.  They have a new movie coming out, and Julia Roberts, Jones sister/personal assistant/abused slave, and Billy Crystal, their amoral publicist, scheme to present them as a happy couple during a press junket for the movie.  Julia's character recently lost a lot of weigh and became gorgeous.  She also has long had a secret thing for her sister's husband.  Gosh, I wonder what could possibly happen.
OK, the genre is what it is, and it has a place in everyone's viewing library.  This one, unfortunately, is a near miss.  First, Cusak is wasted.  We know he can play a great romantic lead, but he's got to have more edge than this role gives him.  This is like watching wet white bread.  Roberts is also surprisingly subdued.  The biggest surprise is Catherine Zeta Jones, a celebrity that I always assumed was 80% public relations creation and 20% talent.  Here, she's clearly having a great time and she brings some much needed zing to her role as a self-obsessed starlet.  She obviously has a comedic gift, and I hope she can find other roles that use it. Crystal, of course, is brilliant.
This is one movie where I would definately recommend getting the DVD instead of the video.  Unlike a lot of DVDs where the producers simply tack on some odds and ends from the cutting room floor and call it ""special features,"" here  the special features are both amusing and offer insight into the movie-making process.  The director introduces several scenes from the movie and thoughtfully explains why each was cut.  The deleted scene of Hank Aziz in the bathtub was the funniest part of the movie.",1007078400,3,1802,4.798701298701299
1328036,2,B00003CY5F,"If you can watch America's Sweethearts without getting too upset that the film dares to update and recycle Singing in the Rain by adding elements of Blake Edwards' S.O.B. and Carrie Fisher's and Mike Nichol's Postcards from the Edge,  you'll find a enjoyable cast, some funny scenes and many missed opportunities that would have made a better film then the one you are watching.  As in Singing in the Rain the plot of America's Sweethearts centers around a famous movie couple that splits up and for the sake of the studio and it's film gets them back together to at least act nice to each other for the benefit of the press and public.  There's a somewhat mousey 'other' woman that blossoms and a key scene centers around the screening of the film.

Julia Roberts was reportedly paid 20 million dollars and she is good in a large supporting role.  Jones really seems to enjoying herself, but unfortunately the script over-sells her spoiled actress character more than it has to.
The film is set up well, and the cast is willing and able to deliver what is necessary which consists of good comic timing and charismatic appeal.  Unfortunately the film decides to spend too much time setting up it's premise and then goes after some rather crude and fairly obvious jokes.  A vicious dog that absolutely insists on sniffing crotches is not something particularly original--but the film wants you to think it is.  Several jokes about penis size culminate in a scene where the jokes become the focus of the film's biggest scene.  Penis jokes aren't new, fresh, or that interesting even when they are as funny as they are here, and to make them the focus of the film's biggest scene, not only disappoints and makes the film impossible to think of as charming , but reeks of the worst kind of  desperation.  It's as if Howard Stern suddenly made an appearance as Buttman.  Not what a romantic comedy or a satire on Hollywood needs.  Even if you are amused you know the laughs were cheap and came at the expense of creating a fresher, better written scene.  It's the kind of miscalculation that is all over this film.  Some scenes work pretty well, others are funny but feel shoved awkwardly into the film and others waste some very capable talent.  When Alan Arkin first briefly shows up as a Psychiatrist/self-help guru and then puts a nice spin on the character he is playing, it's fun.  But he comes back for one more reprise that's over-done and ruins the joke completely by making sure everyone in the audience gets it - - as in poke you in the ribs and make sure you didn't miss it.... Get it... get it?  Billy Crystal's affection for  Catskill comic roots is over represented here.  Billy we like you, and some of your jokes are funny--the first time.
Now if anyone on this planet can make Penis jokes funnier than Hank Azaria can, I am not aware of it.  His supporting role as a Latino lover is laugh out loud funny.  Never mind that he looks nothing like a Latino lover, his ridiculous accent and go for broke characterization are funny.  Unfortunately, they are funny in the kind of outrageous, over-the top manner that is misused in the film.  The film wants to be both a charming familiar romantic comedy at times and also an outrageous and sharp satire of  Hollywood, spoiled stars and phony press junkets.  Blake Edwards already tried to give us an outrageous farce of how phony Hollywood was with his too noisy and slapsticky S.O.B. and we also had Mike Nichol's deliver a better  expose of bad Hollywood manners and star abuses in ""Postcards from the Edge.""
The pokes at spoiled stars, media whores and star fawners  are not stunning inside revelations which haven't been explored before.  Most people know how spoiled stars are and how phony the Hollywood media machine is.  There's nothing daring in 'exposing' this stuff to the audience.  What would have been daring is if they had concentrated more on the details that are less familiar to the audience but the film does not want to risk being too inside---not when they've bankrolled the film with expensive stars.  What a glorious missed opportunity the press junket scenes were since just a few months ago some marketing folks at a major studio were exposed manufacturing phony critics and false quotes to sell movies with.  Tsk tsk.
IMAGE AND SOUND
The film is presented in both a panned and scanned full screen presentation and an anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen version.  The print transfer is good but the film is not visually very exciting and some scenes are innocuously lit.
If you ever want a clear reason why widescreen versions of films are preferable to panned and scanned ones just take a look at the first few minutes of this film in the widescreen and then watch it in the panned and scan version.  Characters are actually cropped out of shots and the whole mood created by a slo-mo shot is ruined in the pan and scan version.
Outside of three trailers there are 5 pretty entertaining deleted scenes from the film available with or without introductions and commentary from director Joe Roth. Most of these scenes would have just about guaranteed the film would have been slapped with an R rating.
FINAL WORD:
America's Sweethearts starts out with a great deal of promise and then catapults any charm and subtlety it captures with large steeping doses of  crude humor and obvious satire.  However because it's a PG-13 film (though probably should have been R) every element of where this film goes is compromised.  And how vicious can a film about Hollywood really get when it's produced and made and stars Hollywood folks who want to keep working in the system anyway?  Some of it is very funny, and the stars charisma though wasted is still enjoyable to watch.  Lower your expectations, expect some crude humor and have fun with the film if you can.  RATE THIS ONE 2 1/2 STARS.

While all the actors are fantastic, Julia, Katherine, Billy, Hank, and John, I just didn't believe the story. Katherine's character was so ruthless, I didn't believe that John's character could ever like her, much less love her. And, they didn't develop the relationship between him and Julia's character enough to make that believable either...
Witty writing, but the story wasn't enough to make me want to watch it again!

1328038,3,B00003CY5F,"I really wanted to like this film due to the incredible cast. Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta Jones. But something was missing and that would be excitement and hoping one feels when watching a romantic comedy. This is not even a romantic comedy but more of an attempt to show the world how shallow celebrities and Hollywood is. John Cusack is one of the most charming and likeable actors and he is resorted to a role that makes him seem pathetic. The beautiful Zeta Jones is a high profile celeb witch and yes she plays the role very well but I hated her character and was sick of all her of complaining. She lacked the poise and grace that she usually has when seen at awards shows. Billy Crystal is just annoying as the agent trying to get the 2 back together. The only saving grace is Julia Roberts. She is as charming as ever and I really cared about her and hoped that in the end she would win in the end. Hank Azaria, Seth Green, and Christopher Walken are great in their supporting roles and were far more interesting then the leads. A predictable story and unlikeable characters make this film something is wasn't suppose to be. It should have been a feel good romantic comedy that turned out to be an annoying, unsympathtic film that tried to bank on it's first class cast.",1006128000,,1312,4.470833333333333
1328039,2,B00003CY5F,"""Americas Sweethearts"" is a bland romantic comedy.
John Cusack has no presence on screen and is unbelievable as Catherine Zeta Jones husband in Hollywood, and is more unbelievable as a love interest for Julia.
Julia is also unbelievable as a previous overweight person who Cusacks character never looked at twice until she lost weight. (How shallow.).
The only good and funny scene in the movie is when Julia Roberts character after finding out Cusack won't confess his undying love for her to Zetas shallow character she goes on an eating binge at the hotel restaurant.  This is when the movie finally focuses on Julia, and the movie begins to pick up speed, however it goes right back to the main characters of Cusack and Jones who can't carry a picture on their own.
The movie is poorly written, very un-funny, and just sits there like a dead noodle.
This is definitely Julia Roberts weakest films since ""Mary Reilly"" which I think is stronger than this mess.
Julia Roberts needs to be the star in her films she is a strong presence like in ""Notting Hill"", ""My Best Friends Wedding"", ""Erin Brockovich"", etc., if she is a minor character they need stronger stars to carry the picture, and Cusack and Jones are not it.
Billy Crystal should of thought a lot longer about casting this film before getting it started.  This is the first Roberts vehicle not to gross $100 million + at the box office in quite a long time, it grossed around $93 million, and with ticket prices sky rocketing it just shows that this film failed in Roberts territory.
A definite dud.  2 stars because Julia appears in it.",1005782400,2,1598,4.679715302491103
1328040,4,B00003CY5F,"America's 'Favorite Screen Couple' (Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack) has a new film coming out, but everything is in chaos! She's divorced him and shacked up with a lisping Hispanic lothario (Hank Azaria); he's hit the skids in a BIG way, and ended up in a bizarre self-help clinic run by a blithely unaware guru (Alan Arkin); and the whacked-out director (Christopher Walken) is refusing to allow anyone to see the film, holing up in the Unibomber's wooden shack! The frazzled studio chief (Stanley Tucci) turns to his world-wise publicist (Billy Crystal) to do spin control, and everything hinges on how far Crystal, and his 'Ace in the Hole', Zeta-Jones' sister (Julia Roberts), will go to keep 'America's Sweethearts' together for the international press premiere weekend!
While this synopsis sounds complicated, the film's tone is light, and the plotline serves more as the basis for a hilarious string of one-liners than as an update of 'The Bad and the Beautiful'. The entire cast sparkles, particularly Cusack and Azaria (who literally steals the film's climax!) Die-hard Julia Roberts' fans may be disappointed that she isn't the focus of the film, but she fits quite well into this top-notch ensemble cast.
Two quibbles about the DVD edition; first, there aren't a lot of 'extras' (the film deserves a 'making of' documentary, and director's commentary, at least); and the encryption of the DVD may make it impossible to play on some DVDs (why all DVDs aren't universally compatible, yet, I'll NEVER know!) For these reasons, I'm giving this film 4 stars, instead of 5.
If you are a fan of witty comedies that rely more on crisp dialogue than potty humor to make you laugh, or are a fan of any of the film's stars, you're in for a treat! 'America's Sweethearts' sparkles!",1005609600,4,1786,4.956666666666667
1328041,2,B00003CY5F,"The question before us is this:  how does one take an all star cast - a veritable who's who of today's top screen personalities, including Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci, Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin - and produce a film as thoroughly inept and wretched as ""America's Sweethearts""?  I'm not sure I have the answer to the question, but I am certainly willing to take a crack at formulating some possible explanations.
Perhaps the fault lies in the thoroughly insipid and inane storyline, which might actually have provided the pretext for some pretty sharp satire - if only the filmmakers had known what they were doing.  In this fictional Hollywood, Gwen Harrison (Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (Cusack) have been America's favorite couple both on screen and off for a number of years.  Their movies are almost guaranteed to be sure-fire box office bonanzas - until now that is.  Just recently, Gwen has moved in with a Latin actor named Hector, bringing to an end not only the famous marriage but also the lucrative career of the once-happy couple.  Eddie has spent the last year at a Zen-type meditation retreat, trying to come to terms with all that has happened.  Meanwhile, the studio is worried about how to promote the soon-to-be-released final film to feature the defunct couple, the solution being to get publicist Lee Phillips (Crystal) to gather everyone involved in the making of the movie together for a press junket at an out-of-the-way hotel in Nevada with the express purpose of convincing the public that there is some chance that the estranged divorcees might be contemplating a reconciliation.
As I stated earlier, the plot could provide some juicy fodder for satirizing the workings of the movie industry, but writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan have failed to provide even a modicum of wit for the occasion.  It's awfully hard to identify with or be charmed by characters who are either self-centered and whiny (Gwen) or wimpy and whiny (Eddie).  We really don't like either of these people and, frankly, when we see them together, we don't believe for a second that the movie going public would be as enamored of them as the people in the movie we are watching keep telling us they are.  We also don't swallow the fact that Gwen's sister, Kiki (Roberts), would put up with her spoiled sister's tyrannical manipulations for two seconds let alone her whole lifetime.  When Eddie and Kiki finally wake up to the truth about Gwen and begin to discover the romantic attraction that exists between them, we feel like we are already five narrative miles ahead of them - a position one doesn't want to be in when the need for audience identification with the characters is as crucial as it is in a film like this one.
Most of the attempts at humor in the film are obvious and crude, whether they involve Hector's insultingly contrived Spanish accent, a scene of a dog nuzzling Phillips' crotch, or a juvenile masturbation gag involving Eddie lurking outside Gwen's hotel room.  Even the film-within-a-film, when it is finally unveiled to us, is a total letdown.  Although Walken brings a cleverness and energy to his overwritten role of the film's eccentric-genius director, the movie that he finally unspools for the curious press and studio onlookers involves humor of only the most obvious kind.  That leads to a final confrontation scene - in which the characters act out their little real life drama for the benefit of the dumbfounded and aghast audience - that is utterly idiotic, inane and unbelievable.  Crystal's performance as the nervous-Nelly publicist involves little more than nonstop dithering in the form of cynical quips and wisecracks.  It is grating and annoying from start to finish.  Only Julia Roberts manages to register as a likable person now and then - but even she can do only so much in a role as shallow in its conception as this one is.
To say that ""America's Sweethearts"" is one of the worst romantic comedies of the past several years would be to belittle it.  Considering the pedigree of so many of the people involved in its making and the expectations that inevitably go along with that pedigree, ""America's Sweethearts"" is one of the worst romantic comedies of any number of years.",1005436800,12,4298,4.896694214876033

pretty much already know what it's going to be like and how it's going to end. Well, surprise ! surprise!, this one is no different than any of the others.

Billy Crystal(who also wrote), stars as a publicist who tries to bring a seperated superstar Hollywood couple back together again for the premiere of their new movie. Catherine Zeta Jones and John Cusack are the bickering exes. Julia Roberts is Catherine's once overweight(Ha!) sister. Naturally, Roberts and Cusack begin eyeing each other and realize what was there in front of them this whole time. Are you shocked?. Uh, no. The movie isn't as over the top and screwball as it could've(and should've)been. There a number of good scenes and solid laughs. But, sadly, they don't come often enough. Crystal himself gets many of the best jokes. If you were the writer, wouldn't you write yourself some good doozies?. Seth(I'm Everywhere)Green also shows up as Crystal's assistant. The best part of the whole cast is Christopher Walken, who plays the new film's eccentric, oddball character. Chris Walken playing an eccentric oddball?. Get outta here!. He also has one of the film's best gags involving the unabomber's old wood shack. All in all, this is a nice, slickly produced film. It's been done before, but, if you like these kinds of movies, then it's pretty nice. Not bad, but not great. Julia Roberts would be wise to steer clear of romantic comedies for a while.

John Cusack is awesome, and I've always loved his movies, since the classic 80's comedy Better Off Dead, and more than ever, after one of my all-time favorite comedies, High Fidelity. Julia Roberts cancels out John Cusack. Catherine Zeta Jones is neutral. And Billy Crystal puts the movie in qualitative debt. Luckily, there is Hank Azaria (Tuesdays With Morrie, Mystery Men, The Birdcage, Quiz Show, The Simpsons, and voice of Venom on the 1990's Spider-Man TV show) to put the movie above the mediocre standpoint. His Spanish sleazeball with a lisp is hilarious, and practically makes the movie, along with the lead actor, John Cusack.

Then there's the Spaniard hurling epithets like ""Bullcheet,"" over and over. See, he's Spanish so he has an extreme accent and sounds funny when he swears. Get it? So many laughs.
