8428885,4,B004GN7FY6,A very useful overview of the AR-15.  I learned enough to be able to assemble my own rifle from a parts kit.,1420934400,,108,3.909090909090909
8428886,5,B004GN7FY6,"This DVD course is excellent in technical detail, function of the firearm and overall knowledge of the subject.  Robert Dunlap is very personable and has a very good teaching style.",1414800000,,181,5.033333333333333
8428887,5,B004GN7FY6,"I bought this after I bought my first AR. The video is somewhat dated but ,like the 1911, the AR is largely unchanged. It really helped me to understand the form and function of it. Disassembly/Maintenance was for me the most interesting.  Title of Tech Manual & Armorer's course is accurate.  This does not qualify as gunsmith training, so don't purchase this for that type of education. I also enjoy watching Bob Dunlap teach, but some may not.",1337299200,3,446,4.705128205128205
