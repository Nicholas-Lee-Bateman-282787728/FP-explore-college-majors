8324208,5,B00000F2WO,"I have been searching for this rare footage online for a very long time, so I decided to purchase this rare gem. It does contain the full versions of ""we're not gonna take it"", and ""leader of the pack"". I've been looking for the full footage of ""leader of the pack""  forever! Even though I'm just a 15 year old kid using my mom's account, Twisted Sister is my favorite band! Now I just need to find an easy way to convert this to DVD to preserve this rare footage. Don't forget to ""Play It Loud, MUTHA!""",1320105600,,503,4.185567010309279
8324209,5,B00000F2WO,"This is a great collection of videos, classics from the days when videos roamed free like the buffalo on MTV and even networks, plus at least one musical romp most people have never seen, ""Be Chrool To Your Scuel.""  This is not just for TS fans, Alice Cooper fans will delight in his joining the guys for this catchy rockin' number.  Anyone who is a fan of SFX makeup wizard Tom Savini will enjoy all the zombies he and his crew created to roam the school halls, grab a bite in the lunch room and dance in the gym.

As much fun as it is to watch, it was more fun to make.  I got to be one of the zombies, along with a couple of friends and a guy who we didn't believe when he told us his agent just got him a TV show, but we smiled and told Luke Perry that we would look for him in the Fall fer shure.  Shows what we knew!

By the way, the guys in the band may look a bit scary (Dee was showing off how he filed his teeth ... ouch!) but they were so nice, spending down time hanging out with us extras instead of a private dressing room.  Alice was really sweet, talking to us all and even letting a girl next to me in the lunch room scene keep a pin that had fallen off his jacket.  I had been looking forward to meeting Tom Savini and showing him my makeup work that year, a Freddy Krueger costume that had won some contests at conventions.  I had brought the claw too, and the TS guys and Alice were diggin' on it.  Alice tried it on, and as he flexed the fingers he joked ""I could really discipline my kids with this.""

Oh, and fans of Bobcat Goldthwait will enjoy his role as a teacher we were supposed to ignore and plow into as he tries to cross the hall ... if you look closely you can see my arm swat the back of his head with my hat (only worn in that scene when we're all still human).  I got a couple shots right in front at the dance and in the lunch room I got to paw Alice Cooper's leg, so it was totally worth it.

So buy this video, and as it suggests on the back cover, ""PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA!""",1162425600,6,2010,3.909090909090909
