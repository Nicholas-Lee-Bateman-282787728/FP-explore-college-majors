8277017,5,B001AD8FIK,"The quality on the DVD is much better than streaming.

Good acting with plenty of gadgets, lots of lightning bolts flying around.

This movie has everything! Mysterious ""rays"" destroying cities, a mind wiping machine, friendly and unfriendly natives, one reasonably attractive woman, and an evil mad scientist! What more could you possibly ask for?

The quality is acceptable, a especially on DVD. You're not going to see this movie restored as there's probably 100 people maximum in America today that enjoy this kind of film.

My only complaint is that the disc was burned on old fashion purple dye media. I would've gladly paid two dollars more for M-Disc that would last a 1000 years.",1524873600,,688,4.956521739130435

Sinister's dubs are from unrestored film stock, thus quality varies with source material condition. None are pristine, yet none are so degraded as to be unviewable. Some of their transfers are in fact quite decent.

Distributed by Super-Serial Productions of NYC, CITY OF LOST MEN (1940) is a truncated movie version of THE LOST CITY (1935), truly one of the worst examples of the cliffhanger genre: 12 chapters and four hours of slow agony in which the stench of amateur acting is exceeded only by constant racial stereotypes of the most offensive sort.

Every episode of this tedious story is over-populated with a variety of primitive Africans who screech, caterwaul and jump around spastically at every possible opportunity. A matched pair of oil-skinned Nubian giants guard the evil mad scientist, Dr. Zolok. One, who gets screen credit for playing ""Hugo,"" frequently crosses his eyes while making otherworldly guttural noises.

Political incorrectness doesn't end with grass-skirted tribsemen. For an hour midway through, Gino Corrado dons clean bedsheets for his role of Sheikh Ben Ali.

The most familiar cast member is 'Gabby' Hayes, wearing a 10 o'clock shadow and portraying a bad guy who turns good in Chapter 11 (there's hope for all villians, apparently!). Of especial interest to antique animation fans is little Billy Bletcher, the gravelly voiced Big Bad Wolf in Disney's THREE LITTLE PIGS (1933) and various evil characters in early Looney Tunes shorts. Here, Bletcher is Zolok's reluctant slave and later, an ally of the Good Guys.

Female lead Claudia Dell was a Ziegfeld showgirl who appeared in ALGIERS (1938), the famous Charles Boyer ""Casbahhhhhh"" melodrama. As an actress, she's beyond wooden. More interesting is Margot D'Use, who's seen in four late episodes as Rama, Queen of the Wangas. A young lady of exceptional beauty, she brings Latin flavor to this odd sci-fi adventure stew. Miss D'Use only appeared in one other film, which is our loss.

Kane Richmond is our hero. That gaping look of terror he wears as a deadly light beam tears through a table top and comes straight for him is right out of a game of Charades. Josef Swickard is Dr. Manyus, Miss Dell's daddy. He has a fabulous mane of white hair and sense enough to let others do most of the overacting.

The story? What can I say. IT'S DUMB. Even though I toughed it out to the very end, it wasn't out of curiosity or admiration. I just cannot in good faith recommend this silly thing.",1373673600,,2588,4.963048498845265
