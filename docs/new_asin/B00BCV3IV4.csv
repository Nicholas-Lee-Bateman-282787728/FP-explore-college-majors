5580101,4,B00BCV3IV4,Amazing connection between the Israeli crew member and recent Jewish history - the connections are astounding!  I recommend this story.,1388534400,,135,5.75
5580102,5,B00BCV3IV4,I saw this movie on cable and I wanted to share it with friends and family so I purchased it.  This is an excellent story of diversity.  A team of heros.  God Bless them and their families.,1386979200,,189,4.054054054054054
5580103,5,B00BCV3IV4,This is a wonderfully touching documentary.  Blake Neely's moving score added to the experience.  This film is a must-see for everyone!!,1370908800,,136,5.428571428571429
5580104,5,B00BCV3IV4,"I, too, saw this on PBS and was very moved by it. I learned quite a bit by watching this movie. I didn't know anything about Ilan Ramon's family's history, and found it quite sad but also very interesting. I was also interested in all the training that astronauts have to go through. And though I've seen videos about that before, adding Ilan's background made it even more real to me. I am about to purchase a copy of this video for my son who has always been very interested in space exploration, even as a child. His children are also interested in it, and may like this film as well, although I don't know how much they know about the Holocaust yet, so that part might be a little disturbing to them.",1370563200,,704,4.3007518796992485
5580105,5,B00BCV3IV4,"I was fortunate to catch this moving program as it aired on PBS earlier this month in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the Columbia shuttle disaster.

One quibble: the program needs a better title.  The rather generic ""Space Shuttle Columbia: Mission of Hope"" does little to alert the viewer that the narrative - while properly paying its respects to the entire, diverse crew - focuses on the moving personal story of Israeli fighter pilot-turned-astronaut Ilan Ramon (ne Ilan Wolferman).  With 135 total missions, US residents quickly turned blas about each Shuttle blastoff, seeming only to pay attention when tragedy struck. But for Israel, Ramon's flight was a matter of great national pride, and his death a cause for great mourning.

But, while in the air, Ramon humbly grabs the stage to reveal his ""mission within the mission"" - showing a small Torah scroll he has carried into space.  It's the tale of this scroll - how it survived the horrors of a concentration camp, how its possessor grew up to be one of Israel's top scientists, and how it came into Ramon's hands - that form the emotional core of the film.

It is a pure delight that the producers thought so much of this story that they captured it on film.  Once again, we have Tom Hanks to thank for his abiding love of space exploration.  Hanks is the executive producer here.  His Playtone production company presents the program in conjunction with Herzog & Company/HCO and West Street Productions.  It's a winning partnership.  Those names brought luminaries such as Shimon Peres into the project.  Peres' regal, eloquent presence is the cap on this well-told story.",1360886400,6,1645,4.898916967509026
5580106,4,B00BCV3IV4,It is a well done human interest story about the Israeli astronaut and his relationships with his fellow travelers and his  national mission,1399593600,,140,5.086956521739131
5580107,2,B00BCV3IV4,"Thought it was more about the Shuttle Columbia, its 90% about just one astronaut. Very rude towards the others on that flight.",1397088000,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5580108,5,B00BCV3IV4,"I feel a slightly personal connection to the loss of the Columbia since I witnessed the break up from my backyard in Texas through image-stabilized binoculars.  It was strange to know what had happened even before NASA knew for certain, to flip on the early-morning TV and see nothing about it.  But even after it was front-page news, I only learned brief biographies of the crew.  They were names and faces, mainly.  ""Space Shuttle Columbia: Mission of Hope"" fixed that in regards Ilan Ramon, the Israeli crew member.  The documentary is poignant and moving.  Highly recommended.",1394928000,3,580,4.989583333333333
5580109,5,B00BCV3IV4,"FANTASTIC!  WITH THE ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE WORLD TODAY, AS THROUGHOUT HISTORY, IT'S WAS SO REFRESHING TO SEE A BIG MEDIA OUTLET NOT BE AFRAID TO ALLOW SHOWING OF THIS PERSUASION AND FACE THE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF A HITLERIAN OR ISLAMIC BACKLASH.",1392163200,,248,5.048780487804878
5580110,5,B00BCV3IV4,This fim told a very interesting story of the Israeli astronaut and the things he took into space  What an amazing account of our spiritual connections!  We all look to one God.,1391990400,,177,4.5
5580111,5,B00BCV3IV4,"Great story, it's unfortunate to have lost such a great crew, but their courage and sacrifice are greatly appreciated after watching this.",1391817600,,138,5.318181818181818
5580112,5,B00BCV3IV4,"This was not what I expected, but it ended up being so much more.  I knew a good bit about the mission, but very little about the men and women who flew on the mission.  This movie focuses on one of the crew, and weaves an amazing story that is beyond words.  I'll be sharing this with my kids.",1391126400,,294,3.9491525423728815
5580113,5,B00BCV3IV4,"I enjoyed the movie short.  It shows cooperation across borders and the real mission that ended in the shuttle breaking apart over Texas on reentry.

The one message that was throughout the movie was the team spirit, the acknowledgement of the danger, and the acceptance of such from the family.

I would recommend this movie for ANYONE wanting the history of the shuttle program.",1390867200,,380,4.90625
5580114,1,B00BCV3IV4,found this viewing was dry and content was more about individual rather that space shuttle. Was not what I expected.,1390176000,2,116,4.85
5580115,5,B00BCV3IV4,"Moving with a wonderful message of hope - this movie reminds me of the best book I've ever read - a memoir by Gregg Tyler Milligan, entitled God Must Be Sleeping.  There are those people among us who never give up, working tirelessly to make this a beautiful world for us all each and every day.

Though the circumstances of the movie and book I mention are vastly different, the underlying meaning in both is one we all seek in our lives.  It is captured beautifully by Mr. Milligan in his extraoridinary memoir . . . no matter what suffering is endured, we all can make it to a better day if keep trying and remember we are here to save one another, and it is in that fight forward that we all truly live.  You can see the same spirit through the people in this movie honoring the memory of those lost by spreading their message.",1388793600,,831,4.273885350318471
8566468,5,B00BCV3IV4,"Such a touching story of hope - in spite of adversity.  I particularly enjoyed the Jewish theme in this story about Ilan Ramon, and Yoya's mini Torah he took into space.",1524182400,,169,4.451612903225806
8566469,3,B00BCV3IV4,"I did learn a lot about the one astronaut and his Hebrew history and biography. While it was admirable, and he was such an accomplished human being, it needed to also include history on the other six crew members. I enjoyed this documentary. I read a lot on the shuttle program, and especially enjoy info about the Columbia.
the title is VERY misleading. Undermines the spirit of them working together as a crew, from different backrounds.",1523232000,,439,4.7894736842105265
8566470,1,B00BCV3IV4,"this was supposed to be about the shuttle, not the holocaust.  poor title.",1520726400,,74,4.6923076923076925
