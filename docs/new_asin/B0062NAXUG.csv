And...the piece you played with one hand --- MAGNIFICENT. There is just so much GOOD in this that it too makes a wonderful present.

Keep on choosing pieces you have an affinity with. It seriously works. And THANK YOU for sharing your talent, your gift, your inspiration and your story.",1508457600,,459,5.0394736842105265
8491235,5,B0062NAXUG,"James Rhodes story is incredible. A musician that has gone through what he has and still was able to become very successful shows what you can accomplish if you decide that it's either become a successful classical pianist or nothing. As he mentioned in his story that ""music saves his life"". Absolutely incredible!!!! Regarding the DVD quality, I noticed the same issue as the other reviewer. Chapters 4 - 6 skip, freezes, etc.. Pretty bad. I loaded the same DVD in another player and I didn't have any issues, so maybe it depends on the quality of the player which it shouldn't matter, but I've noticed the difference between players.",1480896000,,636,4.790909090909091
8491236,4,B0062NAXUG,"Rhodes is a brilliant and original performer and the selection is outstanding. But the DVD itself is appalling. It skips, it stops, it jumps and no amount of cleaning will fix it.. Five stars for the performer, none for the technology.",1410393600,5,235,4.7560975609756095
8491237,5,B0062NAXUG,"This DVD is beautiful. James is an incredibly gifted if not a bit tortured pianist. His past  was torrid with abuse and mental problems but he claims ""classical music saved his life"" and that is the name of the series. The DVD is from a TV series ""Classical Music Saved my Life"" with 7 episodes covering music from Bach to  Rachmaninov. He explains the music not in a technical way but rather an emotive way- what are the driving forces behind the composer and how he identifies with it. Highly recommend",1342483200,4,504,4.527472527472527
