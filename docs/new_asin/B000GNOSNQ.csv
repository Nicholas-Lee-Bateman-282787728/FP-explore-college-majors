8133539,1,B000GNOSNQ,"Worst crap I've ever watched. Kept waiting for the ballet to start, never happened. Penis man was so disturbing it's not even funny. I saw this on Ovation with a bunch of other versions of the nutcracker ballet. Although the story was very different in the nutcrackers, they were good and the purity of the music remained. Not so in this trash. They played the same music over and over, the story, costume and behaviors were seriously disturbing. Whoever thought this crap up should be shot.",1313884800,,491,4.72093023255814
8133540,5,B000GNOSNQ,"i am not an authority on ballet, but after watching this production of the nutcracker many times, i have have been captivated by the fantasy of the story, the costumes and the performances.  i would not have any problem having one of my children watch this ballet.  i think the costuming and unusual fantasy characters, along with the circus theme, would keep children of today extremely interested in the story and would be a good introduction to ballet and classical music.

i thought it was a very modern interpretation of the nutcracker which at times can be a little drawn out and boring.  this was a vibrant and entertaining production. as far as the anatomically correct costume, it should not prevent people of all ages from enjoying this ballet.",1293062400,,754,4.821705426356589
8133541,1,B000GNOSNQ,"Almost made it through the first hour, but the constant distraction of the ""baby"" character's costume fitted with Mr. Johnson & the family jewels was too much.  And his actions didn't help.  Very distasteful and totally unnecessary.  This isn't about the Nutcracker at all.  Why did Ovation have this as part of their holiday Nutcracker Dance Off???  What a horrible production.  Thankfully Tchaikovsky won't see it.",1292544000,4,416,5.2272727272727275
8133542,1,B000GNOSNQ,This ballet terrified my daughter and I just want to warn parents this one's definitely NOT for children! I found (the little bit that I saw of it) rather distasteful myself. Maillot has taken something that for many people has been traditionally a magical and enchanting part of the holidays and cheapened and degraded it with this twisted version.,1291766400,2,349,4.932203389830509
8133543,3,B000GNOSNQ,"While this is a wonderfully creative production, it is certainly not for children and the graphic genitalia on the doll and suggested elsewhere, and behaviors of some dancers, may not be your ""visions of sugar plums dancing..."" That said, definitely worth a watch, and if you are a friend of the bizarre, a purchase.",1289692800,,316,4.87037037037037
8133544,1,B000GNOSNQ,"Stay away from this DVD!!  This is NOT ballet!  Any ballet that was done was pathetic.  It was NOT even a creative version of performing the Nutcracker, like Pacific Northwest Ballet's Nutcracker movie.  The battle scene music & snow scene music was used numerous times.  You will hear the same score over & over again & wonder if they are going to use the nationality music.  They finally do.  Of the nationality ""dances"" - the only one worth watching was ""arabian.""  It was a juggler tossing three rings & then tossing five rings on a ladder as seen at circuses.  The sometime sexual movements between various partners I found inappropriate-especially for children.  This is a 90 min movie - my family & I saw it in less than 30 min.  It was such a disappoint to all us, especially the children - who the movie was intended.  If you are looking for a Nutcracker, stay away from this one.",1231113600,4,889,4.522012578616352
8133545,5,B000GNOSNQ,"Jean-Christophe Maillot's work may not be to everyone's taste, but to any serious devotee of dance his ballets should provide great pleasure. His choreographic style ranges from classical to extreme modern dance movement, and his aesthetic approach is best described as expressionistic. He is never sentimental, but his ballets have great feeling, and often suggest perspectives which are new and refreshing.

In ""Casse-Noisette Circus"" he removes the Christmas element from the story. The young girl Marie (Nathalie Leger) falls asleep reading a book, and the ballet takes place within her dream in the form of a children's party with a circus as entertainment. Like many children's dreams, this has its darker side, and there are elements of sexuality which might disturb some parents -- probably more than it would disturb their children! The most obvious example of this (just to get this out of the way at once) is the character of the Nutcracker himself, danced by the supremely athletic Pascal Molat, who is a clownish rag-doll figure with small but clearly defined genitalia stitched out of the cloth of his costume. One notices this at first, and then discounts it -- or at least one SHOULD. This costume speaks very clearly to the ""naughty"" element of children's fantasies, and is in that sense both relevant and effective.

The children are merry and obstreperous (particularly the boys) and the whole scene is continually lively. When the Drosselmeier figure appears it is in fact two characters, Drossel and Meier, respectively a man and a woman, who act as directors for the party and ringmasters for the circus. The gifts the children are given are costumes, and the stage simply explodes with colour and incident.

The Charming Prince (danced by Chris Roelandt) and Marie have a lovely, if brief, pas de deux, and the jealousy of the Nutcracker (who has been Marie's delight until the Prince arrives) and the mischief of Fritz (Marie's brother) keep a measure of conflict and tension in the piece, however unthreatening. The circus -- which replaces the traditional 'gala' of dances while still using much of the music -- involves acrobatics, trapeze work, and some very fine juggling. The piece rounds off to the child waking from her sleep, and being escorted away by her parents and the Prince. She has, it seems, begun to grow up.

It is difficult to convey the exuberance and delight of this performance, which was filmed before a very enthusiastic audience, and is played on a three-quarter thrust stage rather like a circus ring. The Tchaikovsky score is cleanly and brightly played, although abbreviated, and there is some additional music which, while not attempting to be a pastiche of Tchaikovsky, nevertheless fits in admirably. Nicholas Kahn and Paola Cantalupo as Marie's parents are sublime, and must be among the very few classically trained dancers who would essay a trapeze act, however muted, on stage. Francesco Nappa is a sprightly and Puckish Fritz.

Maillot's company -- all the dancers named, and several more -- has been intact for some years. The dancers know his work and he knows and understands their strengths, with the result that the Ballet de Monte Carlo has a unity and an idiomatic style which yields strong, vital performances.

My only complaint about this particular piece -- and it is a very small one -- is that Gaetan Morlotti and the sublime Bernice Coppieters as Drossel and Meier haven't enough chance to shine, as they are probably the best dancers in the company. For that, you should see Maillot's ""La Belle""Perrault - La Belle / Jean-Christophe Maillot, Ballet de Monte Carlo in which he transforms Sleeping Beauty into something new and strange, and immensely beautiful. Bernice Coppieters is one of the most lovely and sensual dancers alive today, and her work in La Belle and in Maillot's Romeo and Juliet (still available) and Cinderella Cinderella (Monte Carlo Ballet) is mandatory viewing for any true lover of dance.

That said, Casse-Noisette Circus is a delicious, bright, sparkling romp from start to finish, and deserves a proud place beside whatever traditional Nutcracker you may have. Strongly recommended.",1222732800,7,4184,5.081513828238719
8133546,5,B000GNOSNQ,"It seems that everything from Le Ballet de Monte Carlo is very entertaining and thrilling, this being no exception(you might take a look at some of my other reviews of their works).  This modern version of the Nutcracker combines ballet with some circus concepts, but it is still mostly dance.  The stage is gorgeous, with an entrance from backstage onto a raised circular stage, with a center circular platform that goes up and down as needed.  The basic story of the Nutcracker can be vaguely recognized through all the modernisms.  The choreography is thrilling, including several multiple pirouettes at buzz saw velocity.  The part of Drosselmeier has been cleaverly split into a male and female part, called Drossel and Meier(and they seem very fond of each other!).  The only caution I would mention is that the costume of the nutcracker is somewhat ""anatomically correct""; I don't know why they chose this, but it could be a problem for some viewers and parents.  Beyond this, it is impossible to describe the complex action in this great piece, so if you have the courage, take a look at this!",1173657600,12,1101,4.855614973262032
