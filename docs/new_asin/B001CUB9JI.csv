8290011,2,B001CUB9JI,"I first saw this movie in the 1980's when I was in college.  I was familiar with the Actress Sondra Locke.  Although a short make out scene between two women would almost be common place today, back then it was somewhat shocking especially if the leading lady was a known celebrity.  Either I halucinated,  or there was a CLEAR make out scene between Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp right after they are both seen eating at the table  ( Locke is also  stuffing food down her top ).  George is Tied up.  When I saw this movie last week,  at that very point you see a fire lit , hear some soft moaning coming from upstairs and you see fuzzy images....outlines of something going on.  Which could only be the two women.  You really don't see anything though.  Was the scene possibly edited or deleted?  Like I said, either I saw the clear scene, or I halucinated.  I welcome any information or feedback on this.  As for the movie after  seeing it again, I thought in general it was  not bad considering some of the horror films of today.  They also had a very low budget and problems with the director.",1516665600,,1097,4.373134328358209
8290012,1,B001CUB9JI,"very very bad quality. It's obviously a copy of a youtube version of the movie. No indications, no comments no cast and crew information. A very bad surprise due to the price cost. No value!!!!!!",1498867200,,195,4.6

8290016,4,B001CUB9JI,"This was a bad movie. Good price and got to me in short time but the movie- the story was just bad, sad, not good. I thought Sondra Locke made good movies before hooking up with Eastwood, not so.",1389571200,2,195,4.0256410256410255
8290017,1,B001CUB9JI,"this offering is a DVD-R, so buy at your own risk.  It's really amazing, how when I posted the first review, the cover art & product description was to do with the jet set & an entirely different movie by the same name with an entirely different plot & cast.  Now, suddenly a month later, the image displayed previously has been replaced with the correct cover art for Death Game/The Seducers & the product description now matches the film! I'd say this was downright bizarre, but all the same, another official release of Death Game is coming out beside the one currently released by VCI.  I've seen a trailer for it on YouTube & it looks quite decent.  Now, if only we were given a release date & it was listed for preorder.",1255910400,9,726,4.43609022556391
8290018,1,B001CUB9JI,"The cover art for this title clearly indicates this version of The Seducers isn't the one with the stars depicted in Amazon's description, nor the video summary details mid-way through this page.

This DVD displayed, entitled The Seducers is about the jet set, which is a completely different story altogether.

Peter Traynor's Death Game (AKA The Seducers) is about two girls who torment a middle-aged businessman the entire weekend his wife is away & nothing to do with this film whatsoever.

This is NOT Death Game (AKA The Seducers) from 1977 with Seymour Cassel, Sondra Locke & Colleen Camp.  Furthermore, whatever this movie is, is stated to be a DVD-R & NOT a retail product, as Peter Traynor's 1977 film is, which is available on this site for purchase.

BUYER BEWARE!!!!",1252454400,11,779,4.916030534351145
