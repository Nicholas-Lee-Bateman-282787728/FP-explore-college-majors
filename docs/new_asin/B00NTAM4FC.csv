8680099,5,B00NTAM4FC,"Excellent photography and actual Science into the amazing world of the hummingbird.  Recommend highly for those who want
REAL science and not a lot of the evolutionary World View opinions.  When you see this video, you will surely know all the biological
features of this creature had to be in place from the beginning.  It surely is a design creation of God.",1445990400,4,359,4.758064516129032
8680100,5,B00NTAM4FC,"This product was not available for me to buy here so i had to purchase it elsewhere.  The DVD is amazing and full of good science.  Well thought out.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone that is searching for truth about life on earth and how it came to be.  Ken Ham is also in this DVD from Answers In Genesis, the Creation Museum and the soon to open ARK Encounter in Petersburg Kentucky/Cincinnati Ohio area.",1445990400,4,413,4.324675324675325
8680101,4,B00NTAM4FC,Ken Ham is a very knowledgeable man. He has a firm history in Biology (He was a school Biologgy teacher.) As well as a strong foundation on Christianity. We used his DVDs to study alongside our Old Testament history book and the bible at my University.,1422748800,5,252,4.5
8680102,1,B00NTAM4FC,"Uses false science, basing science on a 6 day biblical creation. Do not share this with your children unless you want to have to spend time correcting the science. As a Christian, I found the false science disturbing, especially that related to fossils.",1414972800,,253,4.906976744186046
