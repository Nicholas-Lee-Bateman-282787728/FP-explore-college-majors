8406400,5,B003V5CTF0,Love the pixies great seeing both acoustic and electric shows.  A++++++++,1453248000,,73,5.636363636363637
8406401,5,B003V5CTF0,Incredibly great audio and visual quality. Don't be scared off by the cover art. Good stuff!,1442793600,,92,4.8125
8406402,5,B003V5CTF0,"Bought as a gift for my bro in-law, he seems to enjoy it.",1424390400,,57,3.4615384615384617
8406403,4,B003V5CTF0,"The live electric concert is great. However, I was a little disappointed, as the performance was not as good at the performance I used to have on video tape from Austin City Limits. The sound quality just did not seem to be as good overall in Blu-ray, as it was from a VHS recorded concert. I think this might be due to Joey using that new black guitar, instead of the gold one he used in Austin City Limits.

Either way, it is good...and the old archive footage from the 80s is worth the price.",1409529600,,495,4.2105263157894735
8406404,5,B003V5CTF0,Great concerts!! Any Pixies fan will want this for sure!!  Great sound & the acoustic concert was fantastic.  Great shows for a great price.,1398384000,,140,4.791666666666667
8406405,5,B003V5CTF0,"The songs are all well done.  The cover doesn't do justice to the quality of this DVD, as the Pixies album cover art was always intriguing and matched to equally intriguing albums.  Great to have acoustic as well as electric versions.  The Pixies are often excellent in concert, and this is no exception.  Kim Deal looks like she's having a lot of fun, big wide smile on her face, I think loving to be back--and sometimes, on Black Francis' screams and yelps she'll stop just short of busting up laughing--it's fun to watch.  Great alternative rendering of The Holiday Song, less harsh and more melodic in a way.  If you enjoy Pixies music, chances are you'll enjoy this.  And if you're not into their sometimes harsh sound, the acoustic version will probably be more enjoyable for you than the electric.  Enjoy!",1365724800,,812,4.709219858156028
8406406,4,B003V5CTF0,"At the price I paid, this is an excellent although not perfect blu-ray experience. I've only listened to the stereo LPCM track of both the acoustic and electric shows and they sound great. Maybe I just wasn't following along as intently to the electric set as I was to the acoustic show but oddly it didn't seem to have the same energy or immediacy of the non-electric. You'd think it would have been the reverse. Somehow I enjoyed the songs more during the acoustic show. I'm not a huge Pixies fan but find their style and sound enjoyable for the most part so I really enjoyed this blu-ray overall. While the sound seems up to snuff, the video is not always ""blu-ray pristine"" but it's never horrible either.",1343606400,,709,4.546875
8406407,5,B003V5CTF0,This is a great deal in my very biased opinion. Visual & adio quality are great. And all three shows are on 1 disc. Take into consideration that I would buy a total piece of crap with the word pixies written on the side.,1343260800,4,220,4.0227272727272725
8406408,5,B003V5CTF0,"I was little worried about buying this because the specs on Amazon indicate 70 minute run time and a 1.33 aspect ratio. Well, the main programs are 16x9 1080i/60. The electric set is 92 minutes and the acoustic set is 78 minutes. Audio tracks include 2.0 LPCM and 5.1 DTS-MA.

There's also a couple SD extras that are about 20 minutes each: a featurette and some old footage from 1986.

Enough said. This is a no-brainer for any Pixies fan.",1284768000,33,440,4.4875
