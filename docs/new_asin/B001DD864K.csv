8292845,2,B001DD864K,The into to this DVD is really long and the kids had all gotten up and started to play with toys before she even got to any of the dancing.  If I would do it all over again I would introduce this DVD and fast forward right to the dancing.  Even then it is a lot of ballet with the dog it just does not make sense to me.  My kids ages 1.5-4 were not into it at all.,1337904000,,364,3.5822784810126582
8292846,5,B001DD864K,This is a great video for children who are learning to dance as well as those who have no dancing experience.  My 6-year old niece and four-year old nephew loved the video--and I did too!  It is well produced and very easy to follow.  Just make sure your kids have plenty of space for moving around.,1232236800,,299,4.303571428571429
