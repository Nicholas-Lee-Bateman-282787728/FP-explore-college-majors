That's unusual for an older person to say, but a good example is that music is improving from the state it was in at, say, the turn of the century. Back then, you had many learned-a-new-chord-today punk bands, boy bands, sappy crooners, and The Slut of the Year.

Now, things are picking up, and pop music features serious acts that have honed their skills over the years to make sophisticated music for grownups. Foals is such a group, but just as it took Pink Floyd a long time to catch on in North America, Foals are underappreciated here in the Republic. (I saw them open in June, 2016, for a far-inferior group.)

As with all the best bands, Foals are far better as live performers than recordings they've issued, and this Blu-Ray disc is stunning both in the performance and the beautifully shot and edited video.  Everything about it is high quality.

The only negative comment I can make about it is that I don't like to hear musicians being interviewed. It's always seemed to me that the more accomplished and focused they are as musicians, the less they have to say in speech, so I always skip over the backstage interviews on this disc. It reminds me too much of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap/dp/B000Y5JFN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap</a>.

It's impossible to duplicate the sound and video quality of this Blu-Ray disc on-line in any way, so this is a must-have item for your collection.  It's the finest thing you will ever own.",1468454400,3,1607,4.977611940298507

8611865,5,B00F38SPM4,"Had seen this concert on youtube and it was actually what got me to be a fan of Foals. I was very happy with the video and it being mailed to me in one piece. Nothing was broken. Came right on time. Great video for any Foals fan. Had a lot of extra context as well like extra footage, a full length documentary of the recording of ""Holy Fire"" and you can also listen to the whole album on the Blu-Ray.",1390953600,,401,3.962962962962963
