8413251,2,B000ECX0W4,"I'm a huge fan of Lynne Robinson's Pilates DVDs they are well explained and cater to all difficulty levels. But if you have bought any of her previous ones, don't bother with this.  It's a mish-mash of the last few.  By all means buy this if you haven't used her DVDs before as she is a great instructor but I have to say I felt more than a little cheated by Total Pilates.",1203120000,7,373,4.095890410958904
