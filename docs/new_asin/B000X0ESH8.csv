2993281,4,B000X0ESH8,This movie was sweet. I love this actress and the variation of roles that she has played. The protagonist Na Young-sae really had his work cut out for him when he took on the challenge of teaching Jang Chae-rin to dance. I was so mad when Ma Sang-doo betrays him towards the end. But despite the obstacles the found a way to be together.,1363046400,,337,4.28125
2993282,3,B000X0ESH8,"That about sums up the plot... Chinese Girl brought to Korea to be taught ballroom dancing, they get the dancer, she gets the Green Card through marriage. I was entertained, but in every respect this movie was just OK. The actors.. OK. The plot... OK. Nothing great, but nothing awful. If you have nothing better to do, then this is an OK way to spend a couple of hours. And at the end... love of course. No surprises there either.",1362441600,,431,4.4

2993295,4,B000X0ESH8,"Leave it to the Koreans to add some unusual things to a movie like fireflies, the fake marriage police and dance partner stealing. It was better than expected and the supporting cast were all good at their roles. We like Korean films and this one didn't disappoint though it was fairly predictable and yet another rooftop apartment. The female lead steals the show and it was a good watch.",1490486400,,389,4.6521739130434785

2993299,5,B000X0ESH8,"This movie is absolutely beautiful. Introspective and thoughtful, the director and actors lead the audience through fear, pain, and art with a flawless kindness. While you feel deeply with them, the actors play their roles in a way which doesn't mess with the audience's minds cruelly. I find that many dramas really attempt to torture watchers, but this one is artfully patient and gentle.",1483315200,,390,5.109375
2993300,5,B000X0ESH8,"I have watched this twice.  I am sure I will watch it again.  There is just something about the dancing, the storyline, the chemistry and the ending that is hard to describe, but all is quite satisfying.",1483315200,,203,4.45945945945946

2993343,4,B000X0ESH8,Ist a very sweet movie. liketed very much,1450137600,,41,4.25
2993344,4,B000X0ESH8,"Yes, it's a formulaic movie of the ""older instructor bringing out the dancing talents of a clueless ingenue"" genre, but done with charm and characters you can't help but emotionally invest in. The romance is very G-rated (my guess is because the female lead was a teenager at the time) but sweet. My favorite part was the dance sequence during the ending credits. You can see how hard the two leads practiced for the film.",1449619200,,422,4.64

2993349,5,B000X0ESH8,"Enjoyed this sweet, entertaining movie. Moon Geun-Young is very good as the female lead, a Chinese girl come to Korea to be the dance partner to a professional competitive dancer. The translation during the first 15-20 minutes is peculiar enough to be distracting (like a hillbilly caricature, with archaic slang), but is meant to represent her 'accent' and disappears later on. The team from the marriage bureau, inspecting the couple to find evidence of a fake marriage, provide comic relief.",1442102400,2,494,5.1875

2993354,4,B000X0ESH8,"Cute movie if you are willing to suspend disbelief. No extravagant camera shots, but good acting and dancing. The background humor is funny, but unbelievable. Moon Geun-young is such a sweet actress -- I love to watch her facial expressions.",1438905600,,241,5.05

2993358,4,B000X0ESH8,"The movie is good! It's about ten years old the movie so the quality is of course not HD, but the story itself is good. I was worried the subtitles would be off but they were fine. I love movies with dancing in them and this one was no exception. If you enjoy movies that have to do with ballroom dancing like Shall We Dance? then you would enjoy this one too.",1431993600,4,360,4.013888888888889

2993365,5,B000X0ESH8,A really cute romance that keeps you smiling and also makes your eyes wet.  Could not believe that Moon Geun-young actually learned to dance so well and to speak in the North Korean accent.  A very lovable and enjoyable movie.,1421971200,,226,4.625
2993366,4,B000X0ESH8,"This is a wonderful little film. Geun-young Moon as Chae-ryn is sweetly captivating while her devotion to Young-sae(Keon-Hyeong Park), even in his darkest moments, makes her shine as the heart of the movie.  She gives him a sense of purpose again while his instruction awakens her into maturity. Some of the film elements are a bit far-fetched and the dance sequences feel intermittent. But the movie captures a tenderness that is quite moving.",1419552000,,444,5.082191780821918

2993374,5,B000X0ESH8,"OK...the more I watch this movie the more I love it. :-)  Initially I watched this movie because of Moon Geun - young. However, I have come to love the main male actor as well. Loved all the little things he would do for her - his way of showing he loved her. Moon is still my girl..love her expressions and when she mumbles when she is upset and then smiles when asked what she said. Fav movie with Moon is still My Little Bride. This was a more mature role/story. PS She is a great dancer!",1410480000,,491,4.061855670103093

2993380,5,B000X0ESH8,"and that sums up the theme of this wonderfully entertaining movie, especially if you were ever a dancer (with several knee injuries which ended my career!). This is almost a duplicate of a movie made in India seen on Ntflx which I can't remember the name of, and for the first few minutes I thought I had already seen it. However, this Korean one adds another ""theme"" to it which is very pertinent to the story, which I will not ""spoil"", and although there is plenty of dance but not nearly as much as the one from India, this film focuses more on the character development and relationship between the 2 leads. Several familiar faces in this film if you've seen a lot of Korean films. Acting of the 2 leads great. A few ""F"" bombs and some violent actions which weren't included in the Indian version. Just enough humor sprinkled throughout. I'm VERY fussy about rating films, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one, and would even watch it again. Be sure and continue watching as the closing credits roll for the best cha cha cha dance in the whole film!",1398384000,,1050,4.50261780104712
2993381,5,B000X0ESH8,"I love this movie!  The dancing is really fun, the acting is somewhat cheesy, but that's part of the charm of this movie.  At first glance you wouldn't think this movie is very entertaining, but it was sweet and quite humorous!  The acting is fairly well done and I just love this movie overall.  Would definitely suggest to any romantic comedy fan, or anyone that loves a bit of dancing for sure.",1397692800,2,397,4.472222222222222
2993382,2,B000X0ESH8,"I love films about dance and looked forward to viewing this one with family but the obscene language began early on, should be rated R for parents to be able to screen it.",1395705600,,171,4.212121212121212
2993383,5,B000X0ESH8,One of the best love stories I've seen. This one really goes to the heart. Great actors. Not much I would change about this movie.,1395014400,,130,4.24
2993384,4,B000X0ESH8,I love this movie.  Watched it on Netflix and decided to buy it to add to my DVD collections.  Highly recommended for people who loves comdedy romance movies.,1392336000,,158,4.607142857142857
2993385,4,B000X0ESH8,"Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but in this case the writer chose to move beyond that and end up with originality instead. In fact, you end up with a mild endorsement of arranged unions, secondary to fantastic, joyful dance sequences. That said, I was swept into its spell early on once I realized I had come with mistaken beliefs that this was a children's film on the basis of the female lead (Geun-Young Moon) who, at first, appeared to be so young. Two characters, caught up into a political intrigue, facing deportation in conflict with a rival/dancer doesn't sound like a promising storyline, but this charming film builds up a dance relationship that lasts once the leads establish their boundaries. Isn't that so in life? You will be reminded of familiar dance movie themes, Pygmalion, but they all fade quickly with the wonderful acting and child-like poetry that cuts to the heart of us all when uttered by two lovely souls holding out for each other. The stern dance instructor who melts is played courageously by Keon-hueong Park. Great praise to the editor and director who effortlessly makes you forget this yarn spends most of its time struggling on the dance floor or in a studio loft squeezing your heartstrings. This was a unexpected delight.",1390694400,8,1271,4.861751152073733
2993386,5,B000X0ESH8,"I love Geun-Young Moon she is such an awesome performer, she acts, and in this movie ballroom-dances, very believable performance in every movie, or Korean drama she is on.  Greatly recommend it.  Simple story, stereotypical macho Korean characters, yet there is this love and tenderness as in a good novel.  Loved it",1390262400,3,317,5.0576923076923075
2993387,4,B000X0ESH8,Entertaining and worth watching.  I watched this film without expectations and thoroughly enjoyed the flow of the story and character development.  The plot is interesting and holds up through twists and turns.,1386288000,,210,5.53125
2993388,5,B000X0ESH8,"I'm a huge fan of Moon Geun-Young.  She was just a young teenager in this movie, yet she showed a remarkable sense of maturity and depth of character in playing her role.

What a talented young lady!",1384387200,5,199,4.351351351351352
2993389,4,B000X0ESH8,This is a pleasant remake of Shall We Dance (Vanessa Williams and Kris Kristoferson) and Strictly Ballroom.  You'll see plot and elements from both movies in this.  If you like both they are here in one movie.  Good acting.  Love this version.,1382918400,,243,4.714285714285714
2993390,1,B000X0ESH8,Ok i have a Sony dvd player China bought out so you would think it could play an Asian movie oh soon as I put it in it started flipping and now it cant play anything. Buyer be ware they give no worning or paperwork so what do we do.,1372550400,,232,3.66
2993391,5,B000X0ESH8,"I've seen a few other Korean movies that had alot of over the top slapstick humour that made me want to cringe. This movie really surprised me as it had a very light touch of humour added to the serious story line making it a sweet endearing movie. No the story isn't that unique, but I liked the performances, they seemed believable & I also liked that the characters were likeable. Some Korean movies have the characters crying for alot of the movie...which gets a little old and bogs down the movie. This had the right amount of sadness and gave the viewer a nice ending. The writers were smart & didn't add unnecessary sex into the story, which once again proves that characters in love don't have to have sex or even kiss to show an enjoyable romance. Also, there wasn't alot of foul language(though they do drop a few 'F' bombs).",1371340800,13,835,4.4640522875816995
2993392,4,B000X0ESH8,"I was not sure what the movie would be like when I first started it, but it was actually really good.

The romance is very G-rated (my guess is because the female lead was a teenager at the time) but sweet. My favorite part was the dance sequence during the ending credits. You can see how hard the two leads practiced for the film.",1449619200,,422,4.64

3227846,5,B000X0ESH8,"Enjoyed this sweet, entertaining movie. Moon Geun-Young is very good as the female lead, a Chinese girl come to Korea to be the dance partner to a professional competitive dancer. The translation during the first 15-20 minutes is peculiar enough to be distracting (like a hillbilly caricature, with archaic slang), but is meant to represent her 'accent' and disappears later on. The team from the marriage bureau, inspecting the couple to find evidence of a fake marriage, provide comic relief.",1442102400,2,494,5.1875

Geun-young Moon as Chae-ryn is sweetly captivating while her devotion to Young-sae(Keon-Hyeong Park), even in his darkest moments, makes her shine as the heart of the movie.

3227877,5,B000X0ESH8,"and that sums up the theme of this wonderfully entertaining movie, especially if you were ever a dancer (with several knee injuries which ended my career!). This is almost a duplicate of a movie made in India seen on Ntflx which I can't remember the name of, and for the first few minutes I thought I had already seen it. However, this Korean one adds another ""theme"" to it which is very pertinent to the story, which I will not ""spoil"", and although there is plenty of dance but not nearly as much as the one from India, this film focuses more on the character development and relationship between the 2 leads. Several familiar faces in this film if you've seen a lot of Korean films. Acting of the 2 leads great. A few ""F"" bombs and some violent actions which weren't included in the Indian version. Just enough humor sprinkled throughout. I'm VERY fussy about rating films, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one, and would even watch it again. Be sure and continue watching as the closing credits roll for the best cha cha cha dance in the whole film!",1398384000,,1050,4.50261780104712

3227882,4,B000X0ESH8,"Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but in this case the writer chose to move beyond that and end up with originality instead. In fact, you end up with a mild endorsement of arranged unions, secondary to fantastic, joyful dance sequences. That said, I was swept into its spell early on once I realized I had come with mistaken beliefs that this was a children's film on the basis of the female lead (Geun-Young Moon) who, at first, appeared to be so young. Two characters, caught up into a political intrigue, facing deportation in conflict with a rival/dancer doesn't sound like a promising storyline, but this charming film builds up a dance relationship that lasts once the leads establish their boundaries. Isn't that so in life? You will be reminded of familiar dance movie themes, Pygmalion, but they all fade quickly with the wonderful acting and child-like poetry that cuts to the heart of us all when uttered by two lovely souls holding out for each other. The stern dance instructor who melts is played courageously by Keon-hueong Park. Great praise to the editor and director who effortlessly makes you forget this yarn spends most of its time struggling on the dance floor or in a studio loft squeezing your heartstrings. This was a unexpected delight.",1390694400,8,1271,4.861751152073733

3227888,5,B000X0ESH8,"I've seen a few other Korean movies that had alot of over the top slapstick humour that made me want to cringe. This movie really surprised me as it had a very light touch of humour added to the serious story line making it a sweet endearing movie. No the story isn't that unique, but I liked the performances, they seemed believable & I also liked that the characters were likeable. Some Korean movies have the characters crying for alot of the movie...which gets a little old and bogs down the movie. This had the right amount of sadness and gave the viewer a nice ending. The writers were smart & didn't add unnecessary sex into the story, which once again proves that characters in love don't have to have sex or even kiss to show an enjoyable romance. Also, there wasn't alot of foul language(though they do drop a few 'F' bombs).",1371340800,13,835,4.4640522875816995

8226324,4,B000X0ESH8,"OK, this script could have easily become a 5 star movie, but the supporting cast was too weak to adequately support the story, and the editing wasn't that great.  Those shortcomings alone would easily make it worth only 3-stars, if not for the two leads.  They really carried the film.  Moon Geun-Young was absolutely fantastic, and all by herself adds another star to this film.

I try not to judge a film by its first impression, in case I'm not seeing the film for what it is.  I've watched Innocent Steps three times, and the simple act of fast-forwarding through a few clunky scenes makes this truly worth 4 stars.  The fast-forward skips the worst parts of both the supporting cast and the poor edits.

So, watch it once to find the weak scenes, then watch a second time to fast-forward through them to enjoy all the great scenes.",1508457600,,836,4.570469798657718
