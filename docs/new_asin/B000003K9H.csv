7902621,4,B000003K9H,"With the annoyance that Neelix's character seemed to cause pretty much everyone else on the ship, I thought this is the episode that he would leave the show.
An alien with a disease called the ""Phage"" steals Neelix's lungs and graphs them into this own body.  After hunting down the lung theft, Janeway demands the organs back, only to find out he's already using them.  Kes offers to give Neelix one of her lungs, the alien offers to perform the surgery using their advanced technology to modify organs from 2 unlike species.
This was a good episode, but I feel that the plot was a little weak.  Most episodes have a major story line and a couple of minor ones, as well as the other 'day to day' ongoing struggles.  This one seemed the lack the minor conflicts.",1073433600,,762,4.5
7902622,5,B000003K9H,"One of the prime tenants of Gene Roddenberry's ""Start Trek"" universe is that plot lines will dress up contemporary issues in futuristic situations.  The ""Phage"" is a devastating plague (think AIDS) that is afflicting an alien race searching the Delta Quadrant for ""donors.""  During an Away Team survey trying to retrieve some raw dilithium, Neelix (Ethan Phillips) is brutally attacked and his lungs are removed.  The EMH (Robert Picardo) comes up with a pair of holographic lungs to keep the Talaxian alive, but confined to sickbay for the rest of his life.  Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) personally leads an Away Team back to the planet where they discover a medical lab filled with organs harvested from other unwilling donors.  The bad news is that Neelix's lungs are not in the lab and when a space ship blasts off from the planet ""Voyager"" is in hot pursuit.  But when they catch up with the Vidiians the crew discovers that these aliens suffer from a horrible plague that destroys their cellular structures that forces them to find healthy organs to replace their own, which is why Neelix's organs have already been transplanted into one of their crew.  Thus we come to the big question of this episode: will Janeway kill the Vidiian to get Neelix's lungs back?
""Phage"" (Episode 5, Story by Timothy De Haas; Screenplay by Skye Dent and Brannon Braga; Aired: February 6, 1995) plays off the ""Star Trek: Voyager"" pilot in an interesting way.  The ship is stuck in the Delta Quadrant because Captain Janeway put principle ahead of her crew and here we are just a few episodes later and she is confronted with essentially the same decision on a smaller scale.  The episode also establishes the principle of bartering and negotiation that serves the crew in good stead as they try to get back home.  ""Phage"" is also the episode when the Doctor comes up with the idea of Kes (Jennifer Lien) being his medical assistant (remember, the EMH was only supposed to a short term solution).  It also provides a serious side to the happy go lucky Neelix, who is probably the most cheerful alien in the galaxy.  Although he will always remain quaint until the very end of the series, Neelix really does provide necessary social and diplomatic skills and services to ""Voyager.""",1054339200,,2268,4.81701030927835
7902623,4,B000003K9H,"Well, I must say that I enjoyed this episode, even though at first blush, the premise (Nelix gets his lungs stolen by aliens) sounded pretty silly.
However, by the end of this episode, we were further aquainted with the characters of Neelix, Kes, and The Doctor...and we met for the first time a species of aliens (the Vidiians) that would come to plague Voyager's crew throughout many episodes to come.
In short...this was a sleeper episode for me. Before I saw it, I must admit not expecting much.  But it turned out to be a lot better than the packaging blurb lets on.",995328000,,571,4.543689320388349
7902624,4,B000003K9H,"""Phage"" does rely on one slight contrivance to get its plot going, but its a very nice show.  The concept is mildy goofy, but the show executes it so well it almost plausible someone's organs can be snatched  out from their body using some kind of magical beam.  This was the premise  behind ""Spock's Brain"" but DO NOT worry, ""Phage"" is  much smarter than that brainless (pun-intended) travesty. The crew's search  for Neelix's lungs is very quick and interesting.  Meanwhile, the doctor  has created Neelix a pair of holo-lungs.  Once we find the thiefs, even  they prove interesting.  Not usual for Voyager's villians.  The final  scenes reveal some wonderful characterizations.  ""Phage"" is  classic episode of Voyager.",956793600,2,721,5.094827586206897
