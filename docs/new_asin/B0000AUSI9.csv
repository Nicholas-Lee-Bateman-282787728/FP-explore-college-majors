7997849,3,B0000AUSI9,"The English title does not refer to narcotics, by the way.  This film involves a young ice skater who is obsessive about using his video camera.  If this didn't have a plot and plot development, one would almost think it was non-fictional.  The disjointed cuts and extraneous sights make the work complex, almost in the style of James Joyce's or Gertrude Stein's writings.  However, I do imagine that most American viewers, even non-homophobic ones, will hate this work due to its unconventional (cheap?) style.

A Freudian could have a field day on this because there is so much scopophilia, exhibitionism, narcissism, and voyeurism.  This work will make you think deeply about the power of who is behind the camera and the pleasure or annoyance of those who are in front of it.  It'll make you think about how much boys, even grown ones, love their toys.

This is one of those rare movies that gets better as it ends, especially given that the cool male nudity and posing comes last.  The ending was unexpected which reminded me of another French film ""Romance.""

In the United States, studies have shown that the media overly focuses upon New York and California.  In France, that happens with Paris.  However, this film is shot in Rouen, as the French title states.  One gets to see the medieval, and possibly pre-Christian, architecture enhancing the scenes.

If you didn't know this was a ""gay-themed"" film, the viewer at first might not notice the masked homoeroticism.  Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, straight-identified characters, have blocked each other from having girlfriends before.  Some may call this ""c*ckbl*ck*ng.""  However, the viewer begins to realize, ""Wwaaiitt a minute!  There sure is a lot of focus on men and male bodies.  The only females around are his relatives.  Here's a teenaged boy with absolutely no interest in girls.""  When I read ""The Corporate Closet,"" I feared how straights could learn of the ways gays closet themselves.  This film is a de-masking tool as well.  By constantly asking about his male friend's love life and supporting it, the gay main character is able to avoid suspicion about his own sexuality and fit comfortably around heterosexuals.  This is a vicarious love that those in the know could use against those in hiding.

An Anglophone coined the phrase ""the love that dare not speak its name.""  But this must happen with Francophones too.  No one ever says the G-word (in France, it would be the H-word.)  Though his mother suggests that her son could benefit from a team sport like hockey, no one ever accuses figure skating of being a gender-atypical activity for a young male.  Still, the tacit choices and eroticism in the film is exactly what numerous closeted boys experience.

Though dull at times, this was a thoughtful, chin-pinching film.  I wish more American works could be this nuanced and detailed.",1153958400,3,2876,4.929166666666666
