8442557,3,B004V2FU6C,"Kishan and Sanam are childhood sweethearts, and are officially betrothed by their families.  However, Kishan's father (Alok Nath) is framed by Sanam's father (Kiran Kumar) for a bank theft, and Kishan and his mother (Reema Lagoo) are left with nothing and retire to a village.  Twelve years later, Kishan (Salman Khan) goes to retrieve Sanam (Manisha Koirala) and bring her home as his bride.  Unfortunately, Sanam has changed for the worse and wants nothing to do with him.

This romantic drama/comedy starts off well with a great premise, but dissolves into a ridiculous slapstick in which Kishan ignores the fact that ""no"" means ""no""; the film then becomes serious again, and quite interesting (despite the Stockholm syndrome plot line), but even the solidly good songs can't make it better than average.",1525996800,,807,5.137404580152672
8442558,4,B004V2FU6C,"Sangdil Sanam (meaning ""Heartless Sanam"") was released in 1994 and belongs to the early years of Salman Khan's career; the movie apparently didn't clic at the box office, and it is generally aknowledged that its poor success was mainly due to back to back release of Hum Aapke Hain Koun (HAHK) which, again, starred Salman among many others, and overshadowed any other movie releasing at that moment, becoming an all-time blockbuster.
The story revolves around a bank manager, Kailash Nath, a decent and honest man who is betrayed by the bank watchman, Shankal Khurana, in spite of their mutual friendship and the generosity the first always bestowed on the watchman; driven by greed for riches and social raising, the latter robbes the bank laying evidence for the crime on Kailash Nath, who is charged and sentenced to 12 years in prison. When he returns home after completing his sentence, he discovers no one is in any longer, his wife Savitri and son Kishan (Salman Khan) are not to be found and the watchman, whom he believed his faithful and loving friend, is the one who actually robbed the bank and is now the wealthy and proud mayor of their town.
So Kailash begins the search for his family and will find Savitri and Kishan just in time to rescue them from a millionaire goon, whose son is to get married to Sanam, the mayor's daughter who as a child was engaged to Kishan, and whom Kishan himself is now claiming as his bride-to-be, notwithstanding his childhood sweetheart has grown to be a spoiled and arrogant girl, whom he forcibly takes home with him, not expecting the retribution the woman has in store for him.
What I found interesting in this movie, making it worthy to be watched, is that it portrays a true image of the changing in Indian society, especially regarding the observance of ancient values (loyalty to friends and family, respect for the elders and for old traditions, etc), in streaking contrast with the girls' group (Sanam and her friends) dashing attitude, and with the western attires displayed by frivolous Sanam.
There are also some good stunts and a couple of catching dance numbers, and a good performance by all the cast members, especially by Manisha Koirala portraying the impossible Sanam; I love this actress, watch her in Kamoshi as well! And Salman Khan displays here a range of characters, from funny and joyous to angry and revengeful young man, going way beyond his usual loverboy avatar.
Bearing a mix of ancient and new lifestyle, and an unpleasant female image, maybe that was the reason why the audience didn't receive this movie too well, preferring an endearing, heart-warming, traditional family drama, such as Hum Aapke Hain Koun.
And I agree that the latter deserved all the praise and the roaring success it earned, but I feel Sangdil Sanam was a bit underrated; maybe it was less charming and eye-catching than the other one, which  was a league on its own indeed, but nevertheless Sangdil Sanam had a good cast of characters (some of them to be seen again in HAHK), whose performances I quite enjoyed, so much so this movie to me might at least deserve a 3 (if not 4) out of 5 stars.",1350000000,,3149,4.756855575868373
8442559,4,B004V2FU6C,"Giving this Movie 3 for me that was the Story was too slow & heavy with loads of song. Direction was not well acclaimed & Music was Good.. Credited Casts were Below Average & got quite low reviews.. Seeing Salman Khan & Manisha Koirala Chemistry was Fantastic & also the role played by Manisha that has applied to the theme of the movie The Heartless Lover... was extremely wonderful. Salman Bhai was Excellent in this movie.!!! Though the Movie was a flop, later it was covered by Hum Aapke Hai Kaun Which was released same Year in Aug where it became a higher grosser of the year 1994.. Sangdil Sanam could have done better by adding some more interactive comedy sequences in part of the movie.!!",1306281600,,698,4.5476190476190474
