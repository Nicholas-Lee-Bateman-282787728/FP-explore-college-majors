1196250,3,B000006RE8,"John Savage plays Charles Heller ,a cryptographer in the employ of the CIA ,whose girlfriend is killed by Munich based terrorists .He demands that his employers exact retribution on the low lives responsible .They refuse and in retaliation he threatens to expose the Agency's covert activities unless they train him to carry out his own vengeance .

He gets his way and travels to Czechoslavakia where they have their base .It is there that his problems really start to mount up-the Czechs are not too thrilled by his presence and the Agency renage on the deal and send their own hit squad to take him out .

The premise of the movie is good and the support cast is excellent .The production values are well up to standard and the action scenes are well mounted and credible The locations are attractive too ,with Vienna standing in for Prague .

I was not too impresssed by Savage in the title role -he is a skilled actor but not charismatic enough to carry a movie as the action lead ,and the script fails to build on the ""fish out of water ""scenario as much as I would have liked

It still remains a very watchable movie however and you could do a lot worse than try to uncover this neglected 80's picture",1106870400,11,1208,4.4772727272727275
1196251,5,B000006RE8,"Though this movie is now nearly 20 years old, it is still extremely watchable.  It does not rely on special effects.  It, rather, relies on the development of Hitchcock-like suspense.
In the movie, the magazine  reporter fiance of a CIA computer specialist is executed by terrorists via  random drawing while she is on assignment in europe.  This infuriates the  main protagonist of the movie -- the CIA employee.  He collects enough  information on CIA sensitive activities to blackmail the agency into  allowing him to go into eastern europe so he can locate and eliminate the  terrorists that killed his fiance himself.
He is the amateur in a  professional's game.  The plot is believable, the suspense is tangeable,  and the story line not predictable.
I promise that if you like suspense  movies, you will love this one!  The acting, from main and supporting  characters, is good.  I particularly enjoyed the character who played the  father of the murdered fiance.  CIA officers and execs also play their  roles (though perhaps a bit stereotyped) quite well.
5 stars.",959040000,18,1073,5.022857142857143
1196252,5,B000006RE8,"This is such a suspenseful thriller !
i saw this movie years ago  - and i just had to have it in my collection of thrillers.
i would reccommend it to anyone who loves intrigue and suspense.",1361232000,,189,4.108108108108108
1196253,5,B000006RE8,"So glad that they put this on DVD. This film really did capture my thoughts and attention. The begining grabs your captive attention, that you have to watch it all NOW.",1360886400,,168,4.451612903225806
1196254,3,B000006RE8,Another far-fetched spy adventure that couldn't/wouldn't happen in any semblance that this film presents.  I'm being generous with 3-stars.,1332288000,,139,6.315789473684211
1196255,5,B000006RE8,Perhaps one of the best movies around. It is based on the book of  Frederick Forthside--ODESSA-- This movie gives an idea of how really worked the nazi hunting after WWII and how the nazis were infiltrated all over the place after the war. A true classic.,1314835200,,255,4.543478260869565
1196256,5,B000006RE8,A very good movie.  My husband had seen this movie years ago and wanted a copy for himself.  Found it here on Amazon and am very happy with it.,1273363200,,143,3.896551724137931
1196257,4,B000006RE8,"At least he is CIA intel and that is actually a big part of spying. The fact he wasn't part of the gun set doesn't make him less a spy. The story however wants you to think of him as a helpless  bookworm. John Savage does one of the best roles of his career as a CIA agent that has been relegated to desk duty research which is his forte. When his fiance is killed overseas by ruthless terrorist he wants justice. With the help of his abilities he is able to formulate a plan and apply pressure in a way the CIA can't refuse. Good acting, directing, camera work, and music. Good action and great locations. A very entertaining movie that has been far overdue getting to DVD. Fans of spy movies should enjoy it and many that like action movies as well. Just as in the real world of espionage, all the loose ends aren't always tied in nice little knots. Fans of Tom Clancy will probably enjoy this one.",1183248000,4,900,4.232558139534884
1196258,3,B000006RE8,"Although I can imagine the CIA killing someone to cover a conspiracy I do not find the plot believable. Assigning a similarity to Hitchcock just because the movie relies more on suspense than action doesn't make it worthy of such accolades. John Savage ventures behind the cold war curtain with no language skills and no operative training yet emerges with the girl in hand and all bad guys vanquished; the predictable ending. True, there is a twist at the end that does explain a gap in the plot. This movie is worth watching for no other reason than seeing if you can use the gap to predict the twist.",1181952000,,603,4.541284403669724
1196259,5,B000006RE8,"This is one of my all-time favorite spy flicks, and it is great that it is finally on DVD.  This one was produced during the bad old days of the Cold War, but it still has relevance today, as it deals strongly with the subject of international terrorism, albeit of the Bader-Meinhoff gang variety rather than Islamofascism.  No matter.  This is a really fine film that most will enjoy.

The political message of this film is a bit disappointing, but never let it be said that I allow that to get in the way of enjoying a good film.  John Savage, as the protagonist in this film, does a bang-up job, and I am surprised that this talented actor did not get more roles of this type.

This film features really good Cold War nostalgia, and has the effect of transporting the viewer back to Cold War Eastern Europe.  Christopher Plummer, always a superb character actor, turns in a fine performance as the Czech counterespionage chief.

This is a fine film that anyone who likes spy flicks will want to pick up immediately, and view repeatedly.  Highly recommended.",1177891200,2,1060,4.595744680851064

1196261,5,B000006RE8,"I saw this movie many years ago and have been waiting for it to come to DVD.  This story is especially relevant today, as the country hears more and more about terrorist cells within our midst.  It was interesting to see how an everyday Joe trains (Hollywood style) to become an assassin and to follow the action as he avenges his sweetheart's death.",1120867200,8,350,4.5396825396825395

It has a totally implausible plot...but you are on the side of ""The Amateur"" and cheer him on from the first moment...and, it feels so good to thumb your nose at ""The Professionals"".",1452902400,,353,4.2388059701492535
