8125357,5,B000FP9X6C,"I give this movie 5 stars because of the voice of its remarkable young star, Andrea McArdle. Every song she sings is breathtakingly, heartbreakingly beautiful. If the movie were nothing more than these collected moments of singing, spotlighting the talent of this amazing wunderkind, that alone would be enough to make it a priceless treasure.

Now, in fairness, the movie also tells a story about the rise to stardom of another great talent, Judy Garland, and athough it's easy to see why McArdle was the obvious choice to perform her songs, the portrayal of the young Judy, her driven stage mother, and her loving, but weak father, are somewhat less successful, partly because of a rather pedestrian script and an uninspired director who seemed either unable to bring out the best in his talented cast of actors, or unsure of his vision for the movie as a whole.

If taken purely as a Judy Garland biopic, it's interesting but feels as if the production was rushed to the screen when it could have benefitted greatly from a re-write and a more sensitive director. The raw story still manages to be touching and memorable, but with a better script it could have been even moreso.

What the movie does get right, however, is that the feeling of wonder you get every time Andrea McArdle starts to sing is comparable to the feeling of wonder that we all had when we first heard Judy Garland sing Somewhere Over the Rainbow in the Wizard of Oz. She isn't imitating Judy, and her sound and style is different from Judy, but the level of jaw dropping vocal talent is the same, and for that alone, all else is forgiven and this movie is a must see.",1470960000,,1642,4.616438356164384
8125358,5,B000FP9X6C,Best movies about Judy Garland and her childhood days. Good music and story.  Terrific actors. We need this on DVD.,1428278400,,115,4.75
8125359,3,B000FP9X6C,"If you watch Rainbow, then watch me and my shadows you get a really in depth view of Judy's life - even if parts of it are a bit over dramatic. I didn't pay a cent for this movie - someone gave me a copy and I don't think I would pay more than twenty bucks if I ever come across a copy; it just isn't worth it - but teamed with Me and my shadows it works ohk - it gets a bit of a boost.",1322956800,,386,3.4482758620689653
8125360,3,B000FP9X6C,"I have been looking for this movie everywhere, and I recently got it on ebay for about 20 bucks, I was so happy, that's alot better than the 45 they have here!  I got it because I am a fan of Andrea McArdle, and I was underimpressed with her acting.  She looks dead in the face when she's singing, and she has totally the wrong timber to play Judy.  But the lady for the mother and father are very good.  The best parts I have to say are when Andrea McArdle are singing, she only got the role because she just got off the band wagon of Annie.  And she's too young to look 16 at the end of the film, and she's way to skinny to be Judy.  But for 90 minutes I did enjoy seeing this movie, in fact it was much better than I thought it would be, so I was pleased.  But, I wouldn't want to pay $45 for this.  For a better movie on Judy Garland just buy the Emmy Award winning one with Judy Davis: ""Me and my Shadows.""  But if you'd love to see Andrea McArdle sing, go ahead and fork over the money for this one.",1213660800,2,1005,3.8872549019607843
8125361,2,B000FP9X6C,"I'm with the other reviewer - when I was a kid, I watched this about a million times on Cinemax or some such movie channel that played it over and over and over in the 1980's.  It was my intro to Judy Garland and I've been a fan ever since.  At the time, there weren't many made for TV bios, and it was interesting in that respect.  ""Annie"" was still really big, so I understand why lots of us girls seemed to like this movie.

That being said, seeing it 20+ years later was a different experience, especially after seeing the Garland bio ""Me and My Shadows"" in which the performances are far superior to the ones in this film.  I picked up my copy of ""Rainbow"" cheap off of Ebay, and I'm about 99% sure it's a bootleg, although it wasn't advertised as such.  So be aware if you're buying a ""rental"" copy, it may not be a master copy.

The first major flaw is that Andrea McArdle just ain't Judy.  Not even close.  She doesn't even hold a candle to the personality that ""was"" Judy Garland.  It's not just her bad 70's flip hairstyle and blue eyes either, but she just lacks 99% of Judy's cuteness, innocence and energy, and 100% of her overall vivacity, happiness and sense of humor.  She's extremely ""sedate"" in all her scenes, and that's about as far as you can get from describing Judy in one word.  Her voice is amazing, but different from Judy, and her performances are totally expressionless.  Contrast this with the audition scene from Me and My Shadows and it just pales in comparison.  The year was 1978 though, the year McArdle retired from the Annie role and she was still riding high on that success.  I assume this was probably the reason she was chosen, because I don't feel that she would have gotten this role had she just walked in off the street and auditioned.

The movie isn't all bad though.  The music is nice - it's always great to hear these 30's popular songs, and to hear them differently than Judy's performances of them is kind of nice (IF you can get past the lack of expression and the couple of times Andrea McArdle goes off sync from the pre-recorded soundtrack.)  It's kind of nice to see all the early scenes of the Gumm Sisters, as I felt that part of Judy's life was missing from Me and My Shadows.  Don Murray makes a great and really sweet Frank Gumm and Piper Laurie's performance as Ethel is equally as good, I believe.  This is an okay intro to Judy Garland and my kids enjoyed it, but they noticed also that it pales compared to Me and My Shadows.  It was 1978 though, and at the time, there really was nothing else Judy (no Biography channel, etc.)

An interesting sidelight would be to read Jackie Cooper's autobiography ""Please Don't Shoot My Dog"".  He directed the film and absolutely shreds Andrea McArdle.  He said she was by far the most unpleasant and badly behaved child he had ever worked with in his career.  According to him, she sulked, pouted and refused to do scenes and basically had an awful attitude.  He points out that at 15, she could barely read.  I remember thinking those were pretty harsh words, considering that Cooper's bio was written shortly after this film, and that she must have really been awful for him to have written that.  In any case, it kind of shows in the film - sometimes you're left kind of wondering if she really wants to be doing these scenes at all.

Anyhow, I gave it the two stars for the music and for the writing, as there were a few scenes in particular that I liked, such as Judy's audition call for MGM, etc. and the use of the song Dinah to score that scene, etc.  But if you're looking for a true Garland bio pic, Me and My Shadows is far superior.",1200355200,3,3646,4.3664688427299705
8125362,5,B000FP9X6C,"This was one of my favorites growing up in the eighties.  The story very entertainingly depicts Judy Garland's rise to international stardom, her relationship with her family (especially her father) and her professional relationships with some of the more colorful characters from Hollywood's golden years.  The music is top notch as well.  I highly recommend this film.",1171411200,7,370,5.456140350877193
