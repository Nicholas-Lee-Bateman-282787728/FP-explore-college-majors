8654861,5,B00K0FQMMA,"I don't know why this ballet has so few reviews. I admit it took me  some time to get used to i ,It is really very modern. But after seeing it a few times I started to appreciate the music score and the ballet. Now I really admire it very much,the cast is perfect and Isopova is brilliant ! ( as always )
For me it was a very good buy .",1423267200,4,336,3.6666666666666665

8654863,5,B00K0FQMMA,"The Paris Opera Ballet has already produced a great DVD of this ballet which is still available and highly recommended. Now, we have this brand new performance with a totally different cast and a different ballet company. The leads are by some of the world's great ballet stars, Roberto Bolle and Natalia Osipova. There are also two bonus features of the cast gallery and interviews with the principals among others. It is one of the longest translated(with subtitles) interviews of Roberto Bolle I have heard and he really reveals his approach to this role and we get a good idea of his approach to dancing in general. Osipova also goes into the details of her approach. Both of them dance very well together and are at the top of their form, as are the rest of the cast.
This is an exciting, well established ballet and if you are a fan of the principals, and Teatro alla Scala, you will love this DVD.",1405814400,12,904,4.552147239263804
