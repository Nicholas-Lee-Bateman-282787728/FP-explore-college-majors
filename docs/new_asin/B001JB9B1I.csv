8312752,5,B001JB9B1I,Peter Ustinov is my favorite Hercule Poirot and this is a really good one that I had never seen. Lots of fun and special fun seeing David Suchet playing Inspector Japp.,1516579200,,168,4.451612903225806
8312753,2,B001JB9B1I,"As posted by many others, Peter Ustinov (who is an amazing actor in his own right) does not sell the Hercule Poirot character.  Similarly, Jean Stapleton does not carry over the 1940s era well (and yet I love to watch her in most of her roles).  This failure lies on the shoulders of the casting agents, not the actors, in my opinion.",1510185600,,334,4.370967741935484
8312754,3,B001JB9B1I,"Peter Ustinov is a very good actor, but I like David Suchet much better as Poirot. This story wasn't bad, but much of it was silly. Rather than humorous idiosyncrasies, as in Suchet's acting, much of Ustinov's behavior seems silly to me. His sidekick Hastings seems like a dope. Jean Stapleton playing as an author acts as she did on the comedy All in the Family, as a fool, and is constantly derided by Poirot who also mocks Hastings. Also, and this is significant, Poirot does not ""prove"" who is the killer. He explains who did the crime, how it was done, and why, but offers no proof that what he concluded in his little grey cells is true. A semi-competent lawyer could get the killer freed. He could argue that what Poirot is saying seems to be true, there is no proof that it is true. Another explanation can be found.",1500422400,3,824,4.427631578947368
8312755,5,B001JB9B1I,Enjoyable movie which arrived when expected.  Quality of the dvd was great.  I recommend both the movie and the seller.,1490572800,,119,4.9
8312756,5,B001JB9B1I,"This movie isn't the most recent Dead Man's Folly, but it's good if you like big hair on both men and women.  You can't beat Agatha for a good crime story and this one is worth the price.  It's one of my favorites and I have watched it several times and will watch it again.",1441843200,2,274,3.963636363636364
8312757,3,B001JB9B1I,I like the other Poirot better,1437868800,,30,4.166666666666667
8312758,4,B001JB9B1I,"Watching Peter Ustinov as Poirot is like watching Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple.  Their performances are idiosyncratic, not intended by anyone to be a faithful rendering of the Christie creations but rather a chance to see a favorite performer molding a character to his/her stage/film persona. Once I recognized that fact, I stopped comparing what they did with what a character actor did in trying to be true to the essential Poirot and Marple of the author.  Once I stopped comparing, I began to enjoy their pictures for what they were: entertainments not serious adaptations of one of the Great Ladies of Classical British Mystery.
This one is about  the murder of a young woman at a fair on the property of a wealthy Englishman married to a beautiful young woman. Jean Stapleton, playing Jean Stapleton as Ariadne Oliver, mystery writer, invites Poirot to the fair for which she has arranged a 'Murder Game' for the guests of the Lord of the Manor. She had sensed that something was wrong with no idea of what it might be.
Both Stars are amusing to watch in action and the supporting cast is an assemblage of good character actors along with a number of good looking women and men. It is an entertaining though not engrossing film, not to be taken seriously. Good light viewing for a time in which you seek to avoid troublesome thoughts.",1422057600,4,1347,4.747863247863248
8312759,5,B001JB9B1I,love the story.  love the actors. and I love anything Agatha Christie.,1412985600,,70,4.833333333333333
8312760,4,B001JB9B1I,"I love David Suchet  as Hercule Poirot and he has spoiled me for any one else in that role.  I have been a fan of Agatha Christie for over 50 years I have all her books and now I am trying to get all of her available work on videos I am not sorry I bought this one but
I know it would have been better with David Suchet.",1398729600,2,320,3.6231884057971016
8312761,4,B001JB9B1I,"I'm a big fan of the late Agatha Christie, having read all of her books and attempting to see all the movies and TV shows based on them. Dead Man's Folly was one of my favorite books. Having recently seen the David Suchet version, I bought the Peter Ustinov one (which I had seen on TV many years ago. While David Suchet is certainly the definitive Hercule Poirot, Jean Stapleton is unbeatable as Ariadne Oliver. She really makes this version great.

Can't give it five stars, it was made for TV and looks it, but then so is the David Suchet series.",1391644800,4,549,4.382352941176471
