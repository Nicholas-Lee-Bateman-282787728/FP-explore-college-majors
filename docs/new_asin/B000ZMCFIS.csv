The singing of Vonda Sheppard was innovative and entertaining. The characters of John Cage, Richard , Nell and Ling were always delightful. But three years of Ally whining and crying and lamenting was starting to make me depressed. And then WaLa, they killed off Billy,shipped out  Georgia, imported Robert Downy, Jr., and everything immediately got better. Season 4 was funny and quirky ... and just what I remembered best about the program.

3042846,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I received this item in about 1 1/2 weeks. The brown box packaging was damaged but I suspect that was due to USPS. However the contents was undamaged and in pretty good condition considering it was used. The DVD box set was as pictured and contained 6 DVD cases. Season 1,2,3,4,5 and bonus content. Each season is made up of 6 discs. The box as pictured here was slightly worn but still is 4 out of 5 stars condition, but the actually DVDs and DVD cases were in like new condition.

My only complaint is that season 1 is in 4:3 aspect while season 2 through 5 is in 16x9. I assume the 1st season was originally shot in 4:3 and therefore unavailable in 16x9.

3042852,1,B000ZMCFIS,"Wow. What a difference a decade makes. I watched this show when I was in my early twenties, and at the time it seemed unusual and quirky, with an unlikely heroine and a bunch of unorthodox characters. I did hate Vonda Sheperd's voice, though. That woman clearly never took voice lessons, otherwise she would know that this method of voice delivery is ghoulish.

Anyway, now that I am a decade older, I can't watch this series, not even for the sake of nostalgic feelings. The plots are just ridiculous, the character of Ally McBeal is so over the top, so ludicrous, so stupid, the tip-toeing around her is implausible and annoying, her gestures and incessant bleating silence fillers are impossible to tolerate.

I think I hate the series now. Ms. Flockhart is either a bad actress, or her take on Ally is intolerable. While trying to portray Ally as one of the last romantics, she created an out-of-control teenager who is permanently in PMS mode. Yuck.

There is only one (!) character that is worth watching this show for, it is Portia De Rossi's Nelle Porter. This character is suave, poised, intelligent, elegant, not to mention, absolutely beautiful.

3042857,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I've just watched all five seasons of Ally McBeal again and the gloss it had when it was first aired does seem to have worn off. Basically the story of a kooky, single female professional in short skirts, whose life revolves around her ex, her inner world, and her career as a lawyer, does't really progress very far in it's 5 seasons. It also goes downhill quite quickly from the later half of Season 2 onwards, but more on that later. I remember enjoying it at the time, and watching each episode feeling thoroughly entertained. I am wondering why I've changed my opinion slightly now, but when seen as a whole, the shortfalls do seem more evident. This is a review of the entire series, so there will be SPOILERS.

Season 1 introduces us to Ally and her quirky outlook on life. Basically all of the first season is one long tale of pining for lost love as Ally works alongside childhood sweetheart /soul- mate, Billy, who is now married to another woman. Of course, they all work at the same firm, a company called Cage & Fish. The episodes follow an extremely repetitive template: Ally and her firm take on a case, which always hold up a mirror to the emotions and events going on in Ally's personal life in that episode. As well as defending cases in court, Ally and her colleagues spend each evening after work in a bar, mulling over events of the day, while ""bar singer"" Vonda Sheperd sings songs that - funnily enough - also underscore the emotions and events of the episode. The episode will normally end with Ally (or occasionally another main character) speaking from the heart during the trial, using their parallel pain and insight to win over the jury, and thus winning the case. In almost all 23 episodes of Season 1, Cage & Fish win almost every single case they try - what a record. I think I only counted one episode in which they lost.

Throughout the season, the trademark of the show is to use visual special effects to ""actualise"" Ally's emotions, such as a dump truck tossing her into a garbage crate to symbolise ""being dumped"", and so on. Early on in the season, Ally hallucinates a ""dancing baby"" (a real-life internet phenomenon at the time, which the show's creators pounced on and shoe-horned into the show), which is not effective because it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Actually, to my relief, the ""special effects"" seemed a lot less frequent than I remembered them, and they don't take away from the actual emotions of the show, which to be fair are it's strength. The acting is pretty good all round, lead by Calista Flockhart, who, when not falling over (which the script seems to have her do A LOT), does put in a good performance, and she embodies the title character perfectly. Most of the supporting cast are pretty good too.

Season 2 kicks off in the exact same style, demonstrating that the show really seems to have no direction to move in. Two new characters are introduced, Nell and Ling, which normally speaks of desperation in a show, but luckily both Nell and Ling are very entertaining and played to perfection by Portia De Rossi and Lucy Liu. Nell is by far the more interesting of the two, and I would love to have seen more time spent on her character. As Season 2 progresses, Ally's firm once again win almost EVERY case they are assigned to, and laughably, when one episode appears to challenge this status quo by putting the firm in charge of both sides of a case at the same time (so you would assume somebody at Cage & Fish would have to lose), the end result of the episode engineers a cop-out to ensure that neither side loses. Would it have killed the scriptwriters to allow somebody in the firm to lose cases more frequently that once per season? Clearly the show was never intended to explore the dramatic potential of the firm having a bad patch. On this same topic, spare a thought for Ally's room mate Renee, who is a District Attorney and frequently stands as opposing counsel against Cage & Fish, which means that she ALWAYS loses, so she must be really terrible at her job, and should really consider doing something else!

The worst aspect of Season 2 is that it suddenly switches things around with a mindset change from Billy, who spent all of Season 1 gently rebuffing Ally. But then, just as Ally starts to enjoy happiness with a new romance (finally!), Billy suddenly decides he still loves her and confesses this to her, causing her to falter on her fledgling romance - and lose it. Pah! Ally often bemoans that she can't find love, but it's not her fault when the show's creators come up with curveballs like this that don't make any sense. The dialogue from Billy during these few episodes is terrible, and gives no convincing explanation for the sudden about face.

On to Season 3, and this is where I started to lose my faith in the show on my first viewing. The character of Billy now becomes easily the worst aspect of the show, with his metamorphosis into an idiot. I never really warmed to the character of Billy, and sadly by season 3 she now has no depth whatsoever, which turns this whole plot strand into a cartoon. Luckily there are episodes that still have warmth, where the other cast members get a chance to show some depth. Episodes like the one where Elaine finds an abandoned baby, or where Ling makes friends with people in a care home, are good showcases for some nice stories and acting. Ally carries on dating guys, but it's quite clear that she will never find success with anybody, as evidenced by her dumping a man because he has a silly laugh, or dumping another because he has a bisexual past. Seeing her be this picky makes you lose a lot of sympathy with Ally's so-called loneliness.

At the 2/3rds mark of Season 3, there does seem to be something going wrong with the show. The whole thing suddenly falls apart as several story lines go haywire together. Billy is abruptly written out of the show, Nelle turns evil and dumps John Cage, John is stuck in a lift for an episode (clearly, filmed using a double as they never show his face), Ally's roommate Renee mysteriously disappears for a whole run of episodes, Georgia is totally sidelined at a pivotal moment for her character (grief at Billy's departure), leaving Ally a rather selfish centre stage as the only one depicted as being truly upset. Calista Flockhart does a good job with the material as ever, but the show works as an ensemble and the supporting cast seem to be getting less screen time to present their characters with any substance. Season 3 limps to a halt with a dire 'musical finale""

So here we are at Season 4 and I was relieved to see that the show seem to gather itself again. Characters feel more realistic, although by now Georgia has been silently written out of the show, while Nelle and new guy Mark pretty much has nothing to do. And Renee seems to spend each episode singing at ""the bar"". But the introduction of Robert Downey Junior as a new love interest is pretty good, and it's a shame that this was marred by the later scandal involving the actor, as he brings a lot to the show. Same for Anne Heche as a new love interest for John Cage, another quirky character (of course), but thanks to Heche's acting ability I think it comes across nicely. Season 4 concentrates on Ally's insecurity as part of a couple instead of her insecurity at being single, which is at least a change from three whole seasons where she was incapable of holding onto a man at all. Due to Robert Downey Junior's problems, there are a lot of episodes where he is absent, and it's quite obvious. But all in all, Season 4 is an improvement on the shallow and erratic Season 3.

And now finally Season 5, where the whole thing really unravels and slides down the hillside to the bottom. It's easy to see why Season 5 is the last one. Characters are dropping like flies, some are just not carried forward from Season 4 (Renee, Mark), others gradually appear less and less and then disappear (John Cage), and others are turned into little more than extras without story lines of their own (Nelle, Elaine). The worst aspect of the season is to introduce new characters at an alarming rate - including a new lawyer (Jenny) who is identical to Ally, which seems to serve no dramatic purpose. Ling returns briefly in a new ludicrous side story, and of course (for people that remember it), Ally acquires a 10 year old daughter. The best thing about Season 5 is the introduction of Dame Edna Everage as a side-character. Obviously this feels just as desperate as all the other wacky developments, but Dame Edna is just so darned funny that it's a pleasure to watch the episodes she is in. But other than that the plots go all over the place. Ally pretty much stops taking on any legal cases altogether and all we see is her being a mother. The abrupt tying up of events in the final episode is ridiculously condensed. It's like they only knew this was to be the final episode the day before it was written, everything seems so hasty.

So in conclusion, it's a case of diminishing returns for the series as a whole. The positives that hold the entire thing together and made me want to return to watching are is the main cast, who are all pretty good. There are some touching moments in several episodes. Seasons 1, 2 and 4 are the best. The decline towards the end is unfortunate. But Calista Flockhart and the rest of the main cast can certainly act, but Flockhart is continually forced to endure pratfalls, gasps or surprise, bumping into things and endless hair twiddling, which eventually wear out their welcome. The saddest thing is to wonder if the series might have recovered if Robert Downey Jnr hadn't had to leave, as he was really making the series pick up again, but by Season 5, it seemed like other cast members too were either opting out or being fired. Apparently appearances from both John Cage and Ling Woo were wound down towards the end of the show because the actors playing them asked for it, and Lisa Nicole Carson was also fired for her erratic behaviour on set. With issues like this to contend with, it's no wonder the series was incapable having a longer run.",1439510400,2,10159,4.537915984724496

3042872,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I shouldn't write this as it will show how crazy I am. I absolutely loved this series the first time around. Very different people can love the same show for different reasons. For me, Ally in her emotions and thought is me. The writing for her character and her presentation is true for me. Ally says and acts out in ways I wish I could. Even though the actors act over the top for entertainment purposes, it all seems real to me. I know people like everyone of them.

I am transgender but have never had any sexual happiness or much happiness at all. I mostly live apart from life. A lot of the sadness Ally endures, feels like mine. The relationships with other characters and ""clients"" are closely entwined. I haven't enjoyed the happiness or jokes they share with one another. I feel such emotions good and bad with these people. I laugh, have a lot of tears and usually have a good cry during each episode. In the real world I feel I must keep control at all times. I have never felt like I could live in the ways I feel. Ally gives me what I need most, to be who I am for the short times I am with her. It probably is like some people who want the life of a Jedi Knight.

I hope I haven't put you off because of my relationship with the show. It is funny and enjoyable on a lot of levels. My ex-wife of thirty three years never cried and kidded me a lot about that. She thought the show was hilarious.

Please buy this. It's not like a lot of comedies today, where characters get ""laughs"" by attacking, demeaning and hurting each other. It's a show where you can love the characters and enjoy each episode as their lives unfold!",1411084800,13,1635,4.233974358974359

3042882,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I saw the whole show on Netflix this year for the first time. At first I thought it was a legal drama and it seemed very far fetched. But then I caught on that it is really a quirky romantic comedy which resembles a musical quite often, and has some dramatic scenes.

The main character Ally McBeal is a little stick figure and her personality has the emotional maturity of a 15 years old. She is so neurotic, self involved, border line psychotic and immature, that it is not believable in the least that all these gorgeous smart men are constantly falling in love with her. It's also barely believable that she can be a successful lawyer, since she can't think straight about anything in her life. But as a hilarious comedy, it all makes comic sense.

The supporting characters are also quirky, the lawsuits are unusual and the music and dance numbers are really great. Over all, witty and original comedy, Enjoyed it!",1392076800,2,919,4.597560975609756

I caught this show intermittently while it was aired and bought this set 4 years ago to finally watch it all. I was gratified to see that by Season 2, they had already gone WideScreen.
The show is quirky in ways that are unique, and that is always fun. Fish, Cage, and Elaine are my favorite characters.
Everything is always about Ally though, but the show *IS* names after her, so I guess it has to be.
To me, Calista Flockhart is *NOT* an appealing woman. The show makes Ally out to be this man-magnet. Is it just me? Or is Calista mis-cast for such a role?
I am re-watching the series again now after 4 years (since I can only watch the Gilmore Girls so many times) and again I am put off by the Ally character, and wonder if I would still be put off if it were played by someone else?
She could be Gollum's sister. Think about it. Stand Gollum up, give him some (more) hair and makeup, change his lisp to a stutter, and there's Ally.
The backing music is great, and using a quality musician in Vonda Shepard as the source, and also giving her multiple cameos in the show is always enjoyable.
4 stars for the (sometimes wacky) originality. 1 star off because I am put off by the main character.
I have had no problems with any of the discs playing.
Update:
Although at the time, Willa Holland (Thea Queen on ""Arrow"") would have been only 6 years old, her demeanor in Arrow makes me think she (or her 15-year-older equivalent) would have made the Ally McBeal character more appealing.
Update:
Jun 15 2014
I finally finished this series recently, and although it is unique and quirky as mentioned, I grew weary of the excess relationship dialog. It took a while to get through it because I used this show as a ""gone to bed and need let down before going to sleep show"".
Funny thing though -- after I was done and had to find another series suitable for this role, I realized why it took so long to finish:
It is not that good.
The series I am on now -- Boston Legal (also lawyers in Boston) -- is so much better (but worse theme music) that even in ""let down"" mode, I am chewing through it much faster.
(BTW: Get the last season of ""The Practice"" along with the ""Boston Legal"" series, as it is a necessary prequel.)
I am downgrading Ally McBeal to 3 stars.",1390953600,,2269,4.27906976744186

I'm on Season 2 now and they all seem to be working well, no scratches/skips, etc.

For anyone who's never watched the show - if you ever had funny and sad dating woes and feel like your life is a crazy mess sometimes, you will definitely be able to relate to Ally McBeal.

Clarissa Flockheart is an extraordinary actress, and the rest of the cast is superb. Vonda Shepard does an outstanding job providing musical relief for the series, and I have since purchased several of her musical collections from the show.

YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE if you have even a smidgen of romance in your soul, or if you love to laugh. Thank you, David, Clarissa, Vonda, cast, and all involved. I have watched the entire series four times so far.",1385510400,,807,4.604166666666667

3042912,5,B000ZMCFIS,"If you have never seen the TV show Ally McBeal then I envy you... because you have a wonderful, special experience ahead. This is very rare entertainment. Ally McBeal transcends the sum of its parts (which are plentiful), and achieves a quality of experience that can only be termed... magical.

The first thing to be said of Ally McBeal is that the show makes you laugh. It makes you laugh out loud. I recently went through the whole series again on DVD, and time after time I had to stop the tape to let the latest wave of laughter wash over me. But the gift of laugh-out-loud-funny is just for openers. It gets better from there because the show combines brilliant stories with brilliantly acted out characters and adds brilliantly crafted special effects that gives birth to a unique entertainment experience which can only be characterized as ... brilliant. I'm serious. ;>

But no sooner do you come to realize that you're viewing a real gem of a show, the whole shebang goes over the top as music is magically woven in to the show. Suddenly the comedic riffs shift to song and dance. Some characters have their own personal theme music (like in, for example, Once Upon a Time in the West) that plays when they walk into the room or in some way are focused on. Sometimes its the ""live"" music in the bar downstairs. Sometimes its the characters jumping on stage in the bar downstairs and grabbing a mic. Or sometimes its the cast just spontaneously breaking into song and dance. So beautifully executed, it moves your heart. I'm not a fan of musicals per-say, but when done properly the addition of music to a comedy/drama can move the whole performance into warp drive, and a textbook example of this is Ally McBeal. Beyond the laughter (and laughter's counterpart; tears), Ally McBeal lights up your soul.

I would suggest you go into the series knowing as little about the particulars as you can. Approach the series fresh and unspoiled. There are five seasons total, and if you have read anything about the show falling apart in later seasons ignore it. Yes, the show does ""peak"" during season 2, but season 3 and 4 are chock full of the magic that makes Ally, Ally. Admittedly, there are longer and longer gaps in the magic though as season 5 brings the series to a close. But by then you are so in love with the characters that it's worth taking the ride just to hang out with them.

One last thing; The series *will* push you buttons. The social topics covered in both the courtroom, as well as the characters personal lives, are controversial. You may be made uncomfortable and disagree with some the points of view brought forth. I would just suggest though that buttons are NOT being pushed here merely for knee-jerk reactions. It's done to get us to think about these issues, not as oratory to persuade us to agree with a certain point of view.

Enjoy the magic!",1332201600,3,2878,4.60233918128655

3042922,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I had forgotten that the early episodes of this series were a bit creaky. and at first Ally seemed
so young, goofy and nervous that she felt more like a teenager than a smart 27 year old lawyer.

But by episode 5 or so the show and the character finds it's stride.  And if it doesn't quite measure
up to the best 'grown up' TV of today, it still deserves praise for being one of the series that broke
the mold of what a TV show was supposed to be.

It had an openness to complicated tones that seamlessly mixed wild, sometimes surreal humor,
more subtle humor and drama, to long story arcs and not easily solved once a week problems,
and to being more about character than event, making TV a more novelistic and sometimes
cinematic medium in the process.

Certainly Ally McBeal wasn't the first show to do any of these things, but it was one of the first
shows that was a big success with these new approaches, and that helped paved the way for
many of the best dramas dramadies and comedies on TV in the years since.

I'll admit, with years of even braver shows since, Ally McBeal no longer feels quite as special, and
in fact now feels a little limited.  Especially with DVDs allowing more than once a week viewing,
a certain sameness to Ally's constantly fearful, broken heart and her funny/sad attempts to overcome
it starts to plague the show.

But there's still a lot to enjoy here.  The performances are terrific from top to bottom, and every
'silly' character is given their serious and moving moments, and every 'serious' character is allowed
to be laugh-out-loud funny at times.  Special mention has to be made of Peter MacNichol's 'The Biscuit',
one of the oddest, funniest characters to actually work brilliantly in any series.

The writing is sharp and full of wit and pathos.  The music is integrated in a way that was rare for
TV before, but much imitated since, with montages to songs played and sung by Vonda Shepard
(a great voice) who often also appears in the series as a singer at the lead characters favorite after
hours watering hole.

I do have to say, some of the music now feels, in retrospect, too on the nose.  The songs chosen (or written) almost
always have lyrics that are too spot on, too obvious a commentary on the action,  That good and bad
side to the music sort of sums up my perspective on the series looking at it again in 2011.  I appreciate and admire
it for what it gave us and TV, I still enjoy it, but I'm no longer just blown away by it.  Not in a world of Breaking Bad,
Weeds, Mad Men, Nurse Jackie, Arrested Development, etc. etc.",1323043200,,2577,4.427966101694915

It never seemed to catch my interest as I was too busy studying back then.  I originally purchased the set as it was inexpensive for a show with so many seasons, and I was looking for a new series to watch having just finished watching ""Everwood"" (minus the last season which has yet to be released).  I can't speak highly enough for this truly unique, touching, funny and sometimes melancholy show.  The character development was wonderful throughout, and while each episode had a different case, the story played out as though it were a very long novel.  I was sad when it came time to watching the last season and finally that last episode.

Ally McBeal was a HUGE parte of my life when I was in College and then in Law School. She was just like me. She said and felt everything that I did. Most of all, the best part of it was that it was reflected on a tv show. I was very sad with the end of the show, and since then I couldn't find anything interesting with the content of the show. Until now.
So, when I found it on amazon, I didn't hesitate at all! And I am very much pleased with what I got. It's a full box, with all the songs, quotes and memories from this wonderful cast.

However, the quality of the actual DVDs aren't great.  Granted my standard DVD player could be the problem, but I have never had a problem with a DVD unless it has a serious scratch or smudge.  As the Ally DVDs came straight out of the package and into my DVD player they were neither scratched or smudged.  I am on season 2 right now, and every DVD I've put in has frozen at least once, if not multiple times.  Every time I pull them out, check for scratches/smudges and even wipe them down with a clean microfiber cloth just to make sure, sometimes this works, other times I have to skip through that section.

3042939,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I am in the Third year of Ally McBeal with two years to go. I have watched this series THREE times and it only gets getter.  I could kiss David Kelly for everything he touches turns to gold - Chicago Hope, Ally, Boston Legal and most likely scores of others shows.
Ally McBeal is about work and love and hate and pppppppppproblems in the law firm of Cage and Fish. I cannot believe that throughout watching the episodes I am either laughing or crying -there is no in between.  The place is a madhouse with 'John Cage' who plays a crazy weirdo (as does Ally) and yet they are the smartest lawyers of the bunch.  The show reminds me a bit of Columbo and Ironside (Raymond Burr) with tricks and anything ethical or not---right up to the line and sometimes crossing over a really pissed off judge (and the judges are hysterical)..  Each lawyer, their client, the assistants, and the secretarys have their own personality, kookiness sometimes going all the way up to 'crazy' and somehow it all clicks and comes together so much it will warm the cockles of  your heart.

There is background and stage front music in every episode and it is wonderful with Al Green and a few surprise artists that Caig and Ally conjure up - they hear and have conversations with the artists .  When the musical scenes seem to conjure up singing some of their most endearing songs. You will want to get up and dance and with nobody looking I actually do  (hope their are no peepers but I think they'd get up and run for the hills). Barry White is the gratest and even Gladys Knight makes an appearance.

Best damn lawyer-type show ever ever ever written.

Watch the very first season and I guarantee you will want more and more and still more!

David Kelly--you are the best, a genius and I love everything you do!

If you're buying this to watch in a machine with a slot-type DVD drive (such as a laptop, i.e. a drive without a drawer), think twice. The disks must be thicker than most, or improperly balanced. They jam repeatedly in our laptops and require extreme measures (forced shutdown) to extract.

3042960,5,B000ZMCFIS,"This was one of those quirky little shows set in a law firm.  It uses its cases to set the mood for each episode but also relies on the peccadillos of its main characters to anchor the show.  We have the wattle man, the Barbie doll, the nose noise man; even the unisex bathroom almost becomes a character.

Ally had once dated one of the other lawyers who works at the firm with his current wife which sets the mood for a lot of sexual tension.  Ally is supposedly still in love with him though she manages to fall in love with most other hunky men who walk through her door.

As we move through the subsequent seasons we follow the loves and losses of most all of the Firms oddball ensemble cast.  I can understand how the feminist movement pointed to this series with disdain.  Ally was not an ""I can do"" female.  In fact she was kind of an ""I'm falling apart"" type of gal.  Sort of like me.  Maybe that's why I'm so fascinated by this series.

It's too bad the music licensing issue keep this funny show out of the market for so long.  There is a large current group of the purchasing public who will probably not buy this series because it's now just too old. I'm giving the same review to each year of the series because they're pretty much alike with interchangeable boyfriends and co-workers - but they're all good.....bg",1264636800,9,1328,4.331983805668016

Sure, it gets a bit mushy and 'chick flick' comes to mind in some of the episodes, but the hilarity of not only the characters, but the storylines can't be beat.  I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions with the eccentricity of these characters, from the unisex bathroom to the dance numbers.

What I found as very entertaining 10 years ago I look back and reminisce how much of yesterday's issues are still current. The fact that it was able to poke fun at anything and not take itself TOO seriously made it work. And of course there were episodes with so much drama you just couldn't wait for the next episode. Watching them one after the other made me appreciate the change in the series. As the seasons continue you do notice the writing is not as great as that first one, but without commercials and having to wait weeks at a time gives you enough of a tug at the heart when you come to that last episode. Could it have been greater? Overall yes, only because that first season really defined it so well that it set that bar a lot higher than anyone could have hoped for. A delight then, a delight now. And considering the issues, it does make you think for whatever changes have occurred, are we any better off? Love defines who we are is what the show hinged on, and to some degree, I think we need a little Ally nowadays, to be able to laugh at ourselves now and again.",1261353600,,1214,4.170212765957447

And the guest cast is a who's who of TV and film.  Even if you were a fan of the show you will be amazed at the people who you forgot made appearances.  I expected to find watching this late 1990's era show to be dated.  It wasn't. (Well, except maybe the Blue Swede dancing baby.)

It's crazy, funny, and poignant.  The characters are so nuts that I feel better about my own idiosyncratic foibles.  David Kelley, creator and writer, really has a lock on the human condition.  The characters are not thin caricatures, but three-dimensional human beings. This series not only tickles the funnybone, it also makes one think.  Have fun!",1259712000,2,620,4.738317757009346

3042979,5,B000ZMCFIS,"So, we all either love or hate this show (which is something I've gathered from reading reviews online). Well, I'd have to say that I love the show which is surprising to me since I never really watched in the past. Probably because I was only 11 when it first came on the air.

The box set is extremely easy to navigate, compared to some other shows that are a bit of a hassle to get to the disc you want. The complete ALIAS is a really cool, original design--but you have to take a thing out, fold some things back, decipher which folder you want, then get the disc out of the cardboard sleeves. The complete BUFFY has a neat design as well, but the folders are stacked one on top of the other, so when you want season 7 you basically have to unload the whole thing. Both sets look cool, but are a bit of a pain.

The Ally McBeal set, on the outside, looks great and the cardboard case (both the slipcase and the inside one that holds the DVD sets) are sturdy enough since it'll just be setting on your shelf. Then you have the 6 DVD multi-cases sitting inside the box. Not much to look out, but I love these new ""multi-pack"" DVD cases--the ones that are just as big on the outside as a normal single DVD movie release, but they hold up to 6 DVDs. This is especially great if you want to A) just put the seasons on your regular DVD shelf or B) take a season with you, whether you're going to visit some folks, going on a plane ride, etc.

My only complaint--which almost made me give it 4--is that the set doesn't have anything in the way of an episode guide. I can find episode guides online, but it's nice to have a hard copy, and it wouldn't have cost too much to put even a flimsy little ""pamphlet"" style guide in each of the season sets. On the inside of each season case, there is what amounts to an episode list, breaking down which episode is on which disc--but it doesn't give the plot, air date, writer, etc. A booklet (like the ones released on the complete FRIENDS or GILMORE GIRLS sets) would have been great, but there's nothing like that in here.",1258156800,5,2063,4.204545454545454

As for the product itself...
I love Ally Mcbeal!  It used to be my favorite show to watch on TV every Monday.  I looked forward to the release of the series for so long.  It was very nice to see that finally all the seasons and episodes are in the same package all together.  It was also a nice bonus to see the collection of songs in the final disk.

However, I have to say, for a long awaited series dvd like Ally Mcbeal, I would've expected more from the packaging of the dvds and also the DVD menu.  Everything seems very basic.  The menu interface seems like it is something that is bootlegged.  Also, I would've expected more special features as well, (i.e. deleted scenes, gag reels, etc).  I like the collection of songs a lot, but the CD would've been even better if it had included the songs sung by Robert Downey Jr. as well.

Watching this on a 46 inch widescreen, instead of the TV tube of the 90's makes the whole experience, magical...as if one is seeing all these memories and many David E. Kelley's imaginative creations, in a theatre from a front row seat.

I highly recommend this experience for all Ally McBeal fans.

Thank you.
UPDATE:

Amazon won't let me do a second and updated review, since I already had written one when I first purchased. I can see why they have this policy now.

I an only on the third season and so far, 7 entire episodes have been defects. I have missed seeing all of them, even after gently washing and drying them. Now, everytime I hope to watch Ally, I am in dread that it will break up, as the past 7. The entire disc 2 on season 3, will go unseen my me as it is defective. As were others in season 1 and 2.

3042996,5,B000ZMCFIS,"Ally McBeal: The Complete Series was one of my favorite shows from the mid-'90s. Created by David E. Kelley who I think is a genius, Ally McBeal was the hottest show thanks to a multi-talented cast and edgy, realistic writing. Calista Flockhart was brilliant and hilarious in the title-role, and who could rock those naughty mini-skirts in a law office like her?! Courtney Thorne-Smith and Lucy Lui also had wonderful comic timing, the last season was not so great but hey Ally McBeal was the ultimate dark comedy (and don't forget about that dancing baby and the unisex bathroom!) - highly addictive series!",1255478400,3,608,4.912621359223301

Love how it pulls out easily and the seasons sit in the 'envelope'. I kind of think the box construction itself could be better and the quality of the cover art on the seasons isn't that great.  I'm also disappointed there is no episode guide or booklet. But really....these are picky things . What matters is that the episodes are unedited, original music....and an amazing price. Great strategy. At this price, more people can buy it...supporting the efforts that Fox put into getting this set out to us. I've been loving every minute of catching up with this show once again!

3042999,5,B000ZMCFIS,"Ally McBeal has been my favorite show since 1999. There's just nothing else like it! I patiently waited for the seasons to be released on DVD all these years, and finally get to enjoy them on a nice widescreen tv. I bought Region 2 imports about 6 years ago and could only watch episodes on my laptop. I am beyond thrilled that this has finally been released in the US with all of the original music intact!!!! I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging. Every season's case is no bigger than a regular single dvd case and the dvds are sorted inside very nicely.

I already had the Ally McBeal soundtrack so the bonus cd wasn't terribly special, but it's always nice to have a backup. I haven't watched the bonus features yet. In the meantime, I'm enjoying reliving all the crazy antics of Ally, John, and everyone else who makes this show so unique and amusing. Thank you, Fox, for finally releasing this series on dvd. Amazon was also wonderful to work with. I originally paid $125 for the pre-order and they refunded $25 when the price dropped to $100. It arrived right on time and was packaged very well.

It's hard to believe season 1 came out in 1997 -12 years ago. I have to say this show ages really well.",1255046400,6,1216,4.448430493273543

I've only watched the first few episodes so far, but I can tell that it's just as I remember it...so funny and so quirky!  I am thrilled to have the entire series on DVD for Region 1.  I considered buying a bootleg copy online because I wanted it so badly!  If it takes 7 years to do it right, then 7 YEARS IT IS! Thank you Thank you Thank you FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT.
Also thank you to Amazon.com for the AWESOME pre-order deal and pricing.

3043003,5,B000ZMCFIS,"""Ally McBeal"" is hands-down my favorite show of all time. I've literally been waiting more than a decade for the series to come out on DVD. I'm so thrilled to finally own this amazing boxed set, which is every bit as fabulous as I hoped it would be.

The best thing about the set is obviously the episodes themselves. They're completely unedited in any way, and yes, they do contain all the original music from the show, which is something fans were worried about. Let me tell you, watching Ally McBeal on my big flat-screen TV is absolutely fantastic! The boxed set itself is very nicely designed and encased in high-quality packaging, which I really appreciate. Best of all, the set comes with a bunch of extras, like a new ""Ally McBeal"" CD, the crossover episode from ""The Practice,"" featurettes, and more.

The only slight letdown is the soundtrack CD, which only contains one previously unreleased song. I own all the other ""Ally McBeal"" CDs, so this album really doesn't offer anything new, but I can live with that because I NOW OWN ""ALLY MCBEAL: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" ON DVD!!!

3043004,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I almost fell out of my seat when I saw that the entire series of Ally McBeal was finally getting a DVD release in America! I thought the day would never come. I then, of course, immediately ordered the entire series. I was (still am) a HUGE Ally McBeal fan. When I got the DVD's, I couldn't decide which episode's to watch first. I skipped around through the 2nd, 3rd and 4th season mostly cuz I missed my Nelle and Ling. But now that I have calmed down, I have started the series from the beginning of season 1. BUT, jumping around through the seasons at first made me realize how much I had forgotten about what happened in the series. Also, watching the first couple episode's of the 1st season made me feel like I was watching a new show all over again because it has been SOOO long since I have seen those episodes. This show still cracks me up and I'm so glad that I finally own it. I don't understand why they even bothered to just release the 1st season as well because I think all the Ally McBeal fans out there are just going to buy the entire series now. We've waited to long to wait for each season to have an individual release. lol!

Also, I see that Amazon already appears to be out of stock until Oct. 11th. That's gotta be proof that the public has been eagerly awaiting Ally McBeal's DVD release. And, yes, all the original music is in the show. It even has a sticker on the box that says that all the episode's contain their original music. Thank you Fox!!

I was surprised to receive it Tuesday, the official day of release, and surprised that it came in the sturdiest, best packaging of any series I've purchased. Even more pleasant to see was the label, right on the packaging, that the original music is all intact. Just to top it off, I got a large refund due to the significant difference between the price I ordered the series at (almost $180) and the Amazon price at the time of release (under $100). I haven't, obviously, had time to go through the discs to confirm the claim that the original music is all there -- but I think the worst fears of the series' fans have been allayed and the best hopes have been met.

3043006,5,B000ZMCFIS,"While I will say that the show is just as good as it was before, the review is mainly about the packaging.

Unlike some sets that repackage the same season discs in less resilient cardboard or paper sleeves that cause easy scratches, this set is simply the 5 single season release cases with a 6th case containing the bonus DVD and CD to even out the box.  I, for one, am a fan of this.  I bought it and was fearful of the insides of the box based on many other reviews I'd read of complete series sets arriving with unplayable discs.  The single season cases are very sturdy and what seems to be the standard now based on my recent purchases of Fringe, Supernatural, etc.

I should have checked on that inexpensive equipment prior to the purchase.  After receiving my set, I began my search for THE EQUIPMENT only to find it is expensive and much of it doesn't work well.  It appears that this equipment is not sold anymore at Best Buy or Target.  I did find some on AMAZON, but they were upwards of $70.00. Then, I Iearned about one week after I received my purchase, that Amazon was selling the Region 1 version!  Really bad timing!

3043013,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I love this show. I love it so much that when it was released on DVD in the UK I got copies imported to me and bought myself a region free player. It has been so wonderful having these shows when no one else in America does at the moment. It feels like my little secret. But I am worried over the state of the DVD's.

This set will be 32 discs. Originally I thought they'd just be rencoded versions of the British DVDs... That would have been more comforting. But here we get 5 seasons on 30 discs. The first season is full frame and the rest widescreen. Then disc 31 has a new retrospective featurette, and 5 or 6 vintage featurettes. Also an episode of ""The Practice"" when Ally crossed over and a music video.

The 32nd disc is curious. Fox has announced the set but has not stated if the music has been left intact. I can't see it being changed as a majority of the stories Need the specific songs chosen. They are not random. Also the characters mostly sing them live. It be practically impossible to change the music. Yet I am still concerned as this is fox and you would think they'd advertise the fact no music was changed... But disc 32 offers hope as it is a ""Best of Ally McBeal"" soundtrack. I am hoping these will be new songs not incorporated on the previous 4 albums released for the show.

The album included seems to be Fox's way of saying they too believe that the music was pivotal too the show. Quite recently Fox confirmed- that Yes= ALL OF THE MUSIC IS INTACT!This makes this a most have for anyone who loved this neurotic, short skirt wearing lawyer and her zany friends.

The soundtrack is the gigantic let down of this set. The press release led us to believe there would be previously unreleased music on this album. Bull****! For those of you who already have the other albums you will notice there is only one un- released song and that is ""I Know Better."" They had a huge opportunity to do something really great here and they blew it. Beyond that I will still buy this for the bonus material. The soundtrack listing is as follows.

3043014,5,B000ZMCFIS,"...not the product since that relies entirely upon the issue of the music that originally aired with the episodes. Special excerpts and clip collections are all we in the U.S.A. have seen of Ally McBeal on DVD up to now due to the large incorporation of popular music in the show. Many episodes of Ally had the closing ten minutes or so set in the bar where Vonda Shepard and guests such as Barry White would belt out popular, and unfortunately, copyrighted music. Also, the various characters would express themselves by dancing to popular tunes in a way that I just don't think would come across with muzak.

This has made DVD sets of entire seasons a licensing nightmare. Since Ally was in production from 1997 until 2002, just prior and a little bit after the advent of TV on DVD, this probably did not figure into the calculation of Fox as to how this would turn into a legal quagmire that could not be overcome. The same was true for ""WKRP in Cincinatti"" - the original masters of those shows with the music have been destroyed from what I hear - and then there also is ""Daria"".

Fox has been very tight-lipped about the status of the music that was woven irreplaceably into this show. Do you really think we could get this show for this price if the music was there? Based on Fox's past record of deleting music from TV shows and not telling anyone until after they collected their money, and given the state of the economy and the DVD market right now, I'd think they'd be telling the world if the music was intact. I also think they'd be telling noone if it was missing. So far their silence has been deafening. My opinion is to either wait until some definitive word comes out on the condition of these sets or maybe a compromise would be to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ally-McBeal-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000TGURZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ally McBeal: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and see what was done there as indication of what was done with the other four seasons.",1247875200,82,2045,4.890489913544669

Kelley's brilliant writing and ensemble cast put so much life into the characters that you're laughing so hard in one scene and crying in another.  Break out roles were given to Calista Flockhart, Jane Krakowski, Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Lucy Liu that certainly broadened their careers.  Not to mention Vonda Shepard for her singing appearances and theme song, who was discovered by David E. Kelley and his wife Michelle Pfeiffer, or so I read somewhere.

I remember laughing out loud many nights at this wacky show. After doing some research I decided it may never come out in the US and began researching how to play other region DVD sets since this show was available for Region 2.

If you're thinking of getting this DVD set in Region 2 format, don't worry. Playing it in the US was not hard. The UK based region 2 DVD set is a PAL video format that must be converted to NTSC format to view on a US TV. Fortunately, this isn't hard. There are some DVD players available that do this conversion automatically. Your DVD player must also be multi-region or region free. A quick google search revealed some hacks that could be used to convert certain DVD players to region free.

I purchased a Phillips DVP 5982 at Best Buy. It took 30 seconds to type in the code using the remote that allowed me to have this player work with region 2 DVDs.  The video conversion worked like a charm without me doing anything.

Do your own research, but it isn't hard to watch the UK Region 2 DVD set in the US. I'm only sorry I waited so long to give this a try. I can't wait to watch more episodes.",1213142400,23,1283,4.178137651821863

If you're wanting to purchase this set and aren't seriously considering it because it's Region 2, think again!  Most (if not all) new DVD players can be ""hacked"" in order to change it to be multi-regional.  It's incredibly easy!  Try googling ""dvd region hack"" and look around for your DVD player.  It's well worth the little effort for me because I love so many British shows that aren't available in the US or they have Special Edition DVDs that have extras that we don't have.

However the contents was undamaged and in pretty good condition considering it was used. The DVD box set was as pictured and contained 6 DVD cases. Season 1,2,3,4,5 and bonus content. Each season is made up of 6 discs. The box as pictured here was slightly worn but still is 4 out of 5 stars condition, but the actually DVDs and DVD cases were in like new condition.

My only complaint is that season 1 is in 4:3 aspect while season 2 through 5 is in 16x9. I assume the 1st season was originally shot in 4:3 and therefore unavailable in 16x9.

3277349,1,B000ZMCFIS,"Wow. What a difference a decade makes. I watched this show when I was in my early twenties, and at the time it seemed unusual and quirky, with an unlikely heroine and a bunch of unorthodox characters. I did hate Vonda Sheperd's voice, though. That woman clearly never took voice lessons, otherwise she would know that this method of voice delivery is ghoulish.

Anyway, now that I am a decade older, I can't watch this series, not even for the sake of nostalgic feelings. The plots are just ridiculous, the character of Ally McBeal is so over the top, so ludicrous, so stupid, the tip-toeing around her is implausible and annoying, her gestures and incessant bleating silence fillers are impossible to tolerate.

I think I hate the series now. Ms. Flockhart is either a bad actress, or her take on Ally is intolerable. While trying to portray Ally as one of the last romantics, she created an out-of-control teenager who is permanently in PMS mode. Yuck.

There is only one (!) character that is worth watching this show for, it is Portia De Rossi's Nelle Porter. This character is suave, poised, intelligent, elegant, not to mention, absolutely beautiful.

3277354,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I've just watched all five seasons of Ally McBeal again and the gloss it had when it was first aired does seem to have worn off. Basically the story of a kooky, single female professional in short skirts, whose life revolves around her ex, her inner world, and her career as a lawyer, does't really progress very far in it's 5 seasons. It also goes downhill quite quickly from the later half of Season 2 onwards, but more on that later. I remember enjoying it at the time, and watching each episode feeling thoroughly entertained. I am wondering why I've changed my opinion slightly now, but when seen as a whole, the shortfalls do seem more evident. This is a review of the entire series, so there will be SPOILERS.

Season 1 introduces us to Ally and her quirky outlook on life. Basically all of the first season is one long tale of pining for lost love as Ally works alongside childhood sweetheart /soul- mate, Billy, who is now married to another woman. Of course, they all work at the same firm, a company called Cage & Fish. The episodes follow an extremely repetitive template: Ally and her firm take on a case, which always hold up a mirror to the emotions and events going on in Ally's personal life in that episode. As well as defending cases in court, Ally and her colleagues spend each evening after work in a bar, mulling over events of the day, while ""bar singer"" Vonda Sheperd sings songs that - funnily enough - also underscore the emotions and events of the episode. The episode will normally end with Ally (or occasionally another main character) speaking from the heart during the trial, using their parallel pain and insight to win over the jury, and thus winning the case. In almost all 23 episodes of Season 1, Cage & Fish win almost every single case they try - what a record. I think I only counted one episode in which they lost.

Throughout the season, the trademark of the show is to use visual special effects to ""actualise"" Ally's emotions, such as a dump truck tossing her into a garbage crate to symbolise ""being dumped"", and so on. Early on in the season, Ally hallucinates a ""dancing baby"" (a real-life internet phenomenon at the time, which the show's creators pounced on and shoe-horned into the show), which is not effective because it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Actually, to my relief, the ""special effects"" seemed a lot less frequent than I remembered them, and they don't take away from the actual emotions of the show, which to be fair are it's strength. The acting is pretty good all round, lead by Calista Flockhart, who, when not falling over (which the script seems to have her do A LOT), does put in a good performance, and she embodies the title character perfectly. Most of the supporting cast are pretty good too.

Season 2 kicks off in the exact same style, demonstrating that the show really seems to have no direction to move in. Two new characters are introduced, Nell and Ling, which normally speaks of desperation in a show, but luckily both Nell and Ling are very entertaining and played to perfection by Portia De Rossi and Lucy Liu. Nell is by far the more interesting of the two, and I would love to have seen more time spent on her character. As Season 2 progresses, Ally's firm once again win almost EVERY case they are assigned to, and laughably, when one episode appears to challenge this status quo by putting the firm in charge of both sides of a case at the same time (so you would assume somebody at Cage & Fish would have to lose), the end result of the episode engineers a cop-out to ensure that neither side loses. Would it have killed the scriptwriters to allow somebody in the firm to lose cases more frequently that once per season? Clearly the show was never intended to explore the dramatic potential of the firm having a bad patch. On this same topic, spare a thought for Ally's room mate Renee, who is a District Attorney and frequently stands as opposing counsel against Cage & Fish, which means that she ALWAYS loses, so she must be really terrible at her job, and should really consider doing something else!

The worst aspect of Season 2 is that it suddenly switches things around with a mindset change from Billy, who spent all of Season 1 gently rebuffing Ally. But then, just as Ally starts to enjoy happiness with a new romance (finally!), Billy suddenly decides he still loves her and confesses this to her, causing her to falter on her fledgling romance - and lose it. Pah! Ally often bemoans that she can't find love, but it's not her fault when the show's creators come up with curveballs like this that don't make any sense. The dialogue from Billy during these few episodes is terrible, and gives no convincing explanation for the sudden about face.

On to Season 3, and this is where I started to lose my faith in the show on my first viewing. The character of Billy now becomes easily the worst aspect of the show, with his metamorphosis into an idiot. I never really warmed to the character of Billy, and sadly by season 3 she now has no depth whatsoever, which turns this whole plot strand into a cartoon. Luckily there are episodes that still have warmth, where the other cast members get a chance to show some depth. Episodes like the one where Elaine finds an abandoned baby, or where Ling makes friends with people in a care home, are good showcases for some nice stories and acting. Ally carries on dating guys, but it's quite clear that she will never find success with anybody, as evidenced by her dumping a man because he has a silly laugh, or dumping another because he has a bisexual past. Seeing her be this picky makes you lose a lot of sympathy with Ally's so-called loneliness.

At the 2/3rds mark of Season 3, there does seem to be something going wrong with the show. The whole thing suddenly falls apart as several story lines go haywire together. Billy is abruptly written out of the show, Nelle turns evil and dumps John Cage, John is stuck in a lift for an episode (clearly, filmed using a double as they never show his face), Ally's roommate Renee mysteriously disappears for a whole run of episodes, Georgia is totally sidelined at a pivotal moment for her character (grief at Billy's departure), leaving Ally a rather selfish centre stage as the only one depicted as being truly upset. Calista Flockhart does a good job with the material as ever, but the show works as an ensemble and the supporting cast seem to be getting less screen time to present their characters with any substance. Season 3 limps to a halt with a dire 'musical finale""

So here we are at Season 4 and I was relieved to see that the show seem to gather itself again. Characters feel more realistic, although by now Georgia has been silently written out of the show, while Nelle and new guy Mark pretty much has nothing to do. And Renee seems to spend each episode singing at ""the bar"". But the introduction of Robert Downey Junior as a new love interest is pretty good, and it's a shame that this was marred by the later scandal involving the actor, as he brings a lot to the show. Same for Anne Heche as a new love interest for John Cage, another quirky character (of course), but thanks to Heche's acting ability I think it comes across nicely. Season 4 concentrates on Ally's insecurity as part of a couple instead of her insecurity at being single, which is at least a change from three whole seasons where she was incapable of holding onto a man at all. Due to Robert Downey Junior's problems, there are a lot of episodes where he is absent, and it's quite obvious. But all in all, Season 4 is an improvement on the shallow and erratic Season 3.

And now finally Season 5, where the whole thing really unravels and slides down the hillside to the bottom. It's easy to see why Season 5 is the last one. Characters are dropping like flies, some are just not carried forward from Season 4 (Renee, Mark), others gradually appear less and less and then disappear (John Cage), and others are turned into little more than extras without story lines of their own (Nelle, Elaine). The worst aspect of the season is to introduce new characters at an alarming rate - including a new lawyer (Jenny) who is identical to Ally, which seems to serve no dramatic purpose. Ling returns briefly in a new ludicrous side story, and of course (for people that remember it), Ally acquires a 10 year old daughter. The best thing about Season 5 is the introduction of Dame Edna Everage as a side-character. Obviously this feels just as desperate as all the other wacky developments, but Dame Edna is just so darned funny that it's a pleasure to watch the episodes she is in. But other than that the plots go all over the place. Ally pretty much stops taking on any legal cases altogether and all we see is her being a mother. The abrupt tying up of events in the final episode is ridiculously condensed. It's like they only knew this was to be the final episode the day before it was written, everything seems so hasty.

So in conclusion, it's a case of diminishing returns for the series as a whole. The positives that hold the entire thing together and made me want to return to watching are is the main cast, who are all pretty good. There are some touching moments in several episodes. Seasons 1, 2 and 4 are the best. The decline towards the end is unfortunate. But Calista Flockhart and the rest of the main cast can certainly act, but Flockhart is continually forced to endure pratfalls, gasps or surprise, bumping into things and endless hair twiddling, which eventually wear out their welcome. The saddest thing is to wonder if the series might have recovered if Robert Downey Jnr hadn't had to leave, as he was really making the series pick up again, but by Season 5, it seemed like other cast members too were either opting out or being fired. Apparently appearances from both John Cage and Ling Woo were wound down towards the end of the show because the actors playing them asked for it, and Lisa Nicole Carson was also fired for her erratic behaviour on set. With issues like this to contend with, it's no wonder the series was incapable having a longer run.",1439510400,2,10159,4.537915984724496

For me, Ally in her emotions and thought is me. The writing for her character and her presentation is true for me. Ally says and acts out in ways I wish I could. Even though the actors act over the top for entertainment purposes, it all seems real to me. I know people like everyone of them.

I am transgender but have never had any sexual happiness or much happiness at all. I mostly live apart from life. A lot of the sadness Ally endures, feels like mine. The relationships with other characters and ""clients"" are closely entwined. I haven't enjoyed the happiness or jokes they share with one another. I feel such emotions good and bad with these people. I laugh, have a lot of tears and usually have a good cry during each episode. In the real world I feel I must keep control at all times. I have never felt like I could live in the ways I feel. Ally gives me what I need most, to be who I am for the short times I am with her. It probably is like some people who want the life of a Jedi Knight.

I hope I haven't put you off because of my relationship with the show. It is funny and enjoyable on a lot of levels. My ex-wife of thirty three years never cried and kidded me a lot about that. She thought the show was hilarious.

Please buy this. It's not like a lot of comedies today, where characters get ""laughs"" by attacking, demeaning and hurting each other. It's a show where you can love the characters and enjoy each episode as their lives unfold!",1411084800,13,1635,4.233974358974359

The main character Ally McBeal is a little stick figure and her personality has the emotional maturity of a 15 years old. She is so neurotic, self involved, border line psychotic and immature, that it is not believable in the least that all these gorgeous smart men are constantly falling in love with her. It's also barely believable that she can be a successful lawyer, since she can't think straight about anything in her life. But as a hilarious comedy, it all makes comic sense.

The supporting characters are also quirky, the lawsuits are unusual and the music and dance numbers are really great. Over all, witty and original comedy, Enjoyed it!",1392076800,2,919,4.597560975609756

I caught this show intermittently while it was aired and bought this set 4 years ago to finally watch it all. I was gratified to see that by Season 2, they had already gone WideScreen.
The show is quirky in ways that are unique, and that is always fun. Fish, Cage, and Elaine are my favorite characters.
Everything is always about Ally though, but the show *IS* names after her, so I guess it has to be.
To me, Calista Flockhart is *NOT* an appealing woman. The show makes Ally out to be this man-magnet. Is it just me? Or is Calista mis-cast for such a role?
I am re-watching the series again now after 4 years (since I can only watch the Gilmore Girls so many times) and again I am put off by the Ally character, and wonder if I would still be put off if it were played by someone else?
She could be Gollum's sister. Think about it. Stand Gollum up, give him some (more) hair and makeup, change his lisp to a stutter, and there's Ally.
The backing music is great, and using a quality musician in Vonda Shepard as the source, and also giving her multiple cameos in the show is always enjoyable.
4 stars for the (sometimes wacky) originality. 1 star off because I am put off by the main character.
I have had no problems with any of the discs playing.
Update:
Although at the time, Willa Holland (Thea Queen on ""Arrow"") would have been only 6 years old, her demeanor in Arrow makes me think she (or her 15-year-older equivalent) would have made the Ally McBeal character more appealing.
Update:
Jun 15 2014
I finally finished this series recently, and although it is unique and quirky as mentioned, I grew weary of the excess relationship dialog. It took a while to get through it because I used this show as a ""gone to bed and need let down before going to sleep show"".
Funny thing though -- after I was done and had to find another series suitable for this role, I realized why it took so long to finish:
It is not that good.
The series I am on now -- Boston Legal (also lawyers in Boston) -- is so much better (but worse theme music) that even in ""let down"" mode, I am chewing through it much faster.
(BTW: Get the last season of ""The Practice"" along with the ""Boston Legal"" series, as it is a necessary prequel.)

For anyone who's never watched the show - if you ever had funny and sad dating woes and feel like your life is a crazy mess sometimes, you will definitely be able to relate to Ally McBeal.

3277409,5,B000ZMCFIS,"If you have never seen the TV show Ally McBeal then I envy you... because you have a wonderful, special experience ahead. This is very rare entertainment. Ally McBeal transcends the sum of its parts (which are plentiful), and achieves a quality of experience that can only be termed... magical.

The first thing to be said of Ally McBeal is that the show makes you laugh. It makes you laugh out loud. I recently went through the whole series again on DVD, and time after time I had to stop the tape to let the latest wave of laughter wash over me. But the gift of laugh-out-loud-funny is just for openers. It gets better from there because the show combines brilliant stories with brilliantly acted out characters and adds brilliantly crafted special effects that gives birth to a unique entertainment experience which can only be characterized as ... brilliant. I'm serious. ;>

But no sooner do you come to realize that you're viewing a real gem of a show, the whole shebang goes over the top as music is magically woven in to the show. Suddenly the comedic riffs shift to song and dance. Some characters have their own personal theme music (like in, for example, Once Upon a Time in the West) that plays when they walk into the room or in some way are focused on. Sometimes its the ""live"" music in the bar downstairs. Sometimes its the characters jumping on stage in the bar downstairs and grabbing a mic. Or sometimes its the cast just spontaneously breaking into song and dance. So beautifully executed, it moves your heart. I'm not a fan of musicals per-say, but when done properly the addition of music to a comedy/drama can move the whole performance into warp drive, and a textbook example of this is Ally McBeal. Beyond the laughter (and laughter's counterpart; tears), Ally McBeal lights up your soul.

I would suggest you go into the series knowing as little about the particulars as you can. Approach the series fresh and unspoiled. There are five seasons total, and if you have read anything about the show falling apart in later seasons ignore it. Yes, the show does ""peak"" during season 2, but season 3 and 4 are chock full of the magic that makes Ally, Ally. Admittedly, there are longer and longer gaps in the magic though as season 5 brings the series to a close. But by then you are so in love with the characters that it's worth taking the ride just to hang out with them.

One last thing; The series *will* push you buttons. The social topics covered in both the courtroom, as well as the characters personal lives, are controversial. You may be made uncomfortable and disagree with some the points of view brought forth. I would just suggest though that buttons are NOT being pushed here merely for knee-jerk reactions. It's done to get us to think about these issues, not as oratory to persuade us to agree with a certain point of view.

Enjoy the magic!",1332201600,3,2878,4.60233918128655

3277419,4,B000ZMCFIS,"I had forgotten that the early episodes of this series were a bit creaky. and at first Ally seemed
so young, goofy and nervous that she felt more like a teenager than a smart 27 year old lawyer.

But by episode 5 or so the show and the character finds it's stride.  And if it doesn't quite measure
up to the best 'grown up' TV of today, it still deserves praise for being one of the series that broke
the mold of what a TV show was supposed to be.

It had an openness to complicated tones that seamlessly mixed wild, sometimes surreal humor,
more subtle humor and drama, to long story arcs and not easily solved once a week problems,
and to being more about character than event, making TV a more novelistic and sometimes
cinematic medium in the process.

Certainly Ally McBeal wasn't the first show to do any of these things, but it was one of the first
shows that was a big success with these new approaches, and that helped paved the way for
many of the best dramas dramadies and comedies on TV in the years since.

I'll admit, with years of even braver shows since, Ally McBeal no longer feels quite as special, and
in fact now feels a little limited.  Especially with DVDs allowing more than once a week viewing,
a certain sameness to Ally's constantly fearful, broken heart and her funny/sad attempts to overcome
it starts to plague the show.

But there's still a lot to enjoy here.  The performances are terrific from top to bottom, and every
'silly' character is given their serious and moving moments, and every 'serious' character is allowed
to be laugh-out-loud funny at times.  Special mention has to be made of Peter MacNichol's 'The Biscuit',
one of the oddest, funniest characters to actually work brilliantly in any series.

The writing is sharp and full of wit and pathos.  The music is integrated in a way that was rare for
TV before, but much imitated since, with montages to songs played and sung by Vonda Shepard
(a great voice) who often also appears in the series as a singer at the lead characters favorite after
hours watering hole.

I do have to say, some of the music now feels, in retrospect, too on the nose.  The songs chosen (or written) almost
always have lyrics that are too spot on, too obvious a commentary on the action,  That good and bad
side to the music sort of sums up my perspective on the series looking at it again in 2011.  I appreciate and admire
it for what it gave us and TV, I still enjoy it, but I'm no longer just blown away by it.  Not in a world of Breaking Bad,
Weeds, Mad Men, Nurse Jackie, Arrested Development, etc. etc.",1323043200,,2577,4.427966101694915

It never seemed to catch my interest as I was too busy studying back then.  I originally purchased the set as it was inexpensive for a show with so many seasons, and I was looking for a new series to watch having just finished watching ""Everwood"" (minus the last season which has yet to be released).  I can't speak highly enough for this truly unique, touching, funny and sometimes melancholy show.  The character development was wonderful throughout, and while each episode had a different case, the story played out as though it were a very long novel.  I was sad when it came time to watching the last season and finally that last episode.  If I have any complaint, I wasn't too fond of the one character, Claire if I remember correctly), but otherwise the show stayed true to itself throughout and provided me many hours of being glued to the TV :)",1307923200,,987,4.4804469273743015

Ally McBeal was a HUGE parte of my life when I was in College and then in Law School. She was just like me. She said and felt everything that I did. Most of all, the best part of it was that it was reflected on a tv show. I was very sad with the end of the show, and since then I couldn't find anything interesting with the content of the show. Until now.
So, when I found it on amazon, I didn't hesitate at all! And I am very much pleased with what I got. It's a full box, with all the songs, quotes and memories from this wonderful cast.

However, the quality of the actual DVDs aren't great.  Granted my standard DVD player could be the problem, but I have never had a problem with a DVD unless it has a serious scratch or smudge.  As the Ally DVDs came straight out of the package and into my DVD player they were neither scratched or smudged.  I am on season 2 right now, and every DVD I've put in has frozen at least once, if not multiple times.  Every time I pull them out, check for scratches/smudges and even wipe them down with a clean microfiber cloth just to make sure, sometimes this works, other times I have to skip through that section.

3277436,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I am in the Third year of Ally McBeal with two years to go. I have watched this series THREE times and it only gets getter.  I could kiss David Kelly for everything he touches turns to gold - Chicago Hope, Ally, Boston Legal and most likely scores of others shows.
Ally McBeal is about work and love and hate and pppppppppproblems in the law firm of Cage and Fish. I cannot believe that throughout watching the episodes I am either laughing or crying -there is no in between.  The place is a madhouse with 'John Cage' who plays a crazy weirdo (as does Ally) and yet they are the smartest lawyers of the bunch.  The show reminds me a bit of Columbo and Ironside (Raymond Burr) with tricks and anything ethical or not---right up to the line and sometimes crossing over a really pissed off judge (and the judges are hysterical)..  Each lawyer, their client, the assistants, and the secretarys have their own personality, kookiness sometimes going all the way up to 'crazy' and somehow it all clicks and comes together so much it will warm the cockles of  your heart.

There is background and stage front music in every episode and it is wonderful with Al Green and a few surprise artists that Caig and Ally conjure up - they hear and have conversations with the artists .  When the musical scenes seem to conjure up singing some of their most endearing songs. You will want to get up and dance and with nobody looking I actually do  (hope their are no peepers but I think they'd get up and run for the hills). Barry White is the gratest and even Gladys Knight makes an appearance.

Best damn lawyer-type show ever ever ever written.

Watch the very first season and I guarantee you will want more and more and still more!

David Kelly--you are the best, a genius and I love everything you do!

3277457,5,B000ZMCFIS,"This was one of those quirky little shows set in a law firm.  It uses its cases to set the mood for each episode but also relies on the peccadillos of its main characters to anchor the show.  We have the wattle man, the Barbie doll, the nose noise man; even the unisex bathroom almost becomes a character.

Ally had once dated one of the other lawyers who works at the firm with his current wife which sets the mood for a lot of sexual tension.  Ally is supposedly still in love with him though she manages to fall in love with most other hunky men who walk through her door.

As we move through the subsequent seasons we follow the loves and losses of most all of the Firms oddball ensemble cast.  I can understand how the feminist movement pointed to this series with disdain.  Ally was not an ""I can do"" female.  In fact she was kind of an ""I'm falling apart"" type of gal.  Sort of like me.  Maybe that's why I'm so fascinated by this series.

It's too bad the music licensing issue keep this funny show out of the market for so long.  There is a large current group of the purchasing public who will probably not buy this series because it's now just too old. I'm giving the same review to each year of the series because they're pretty much alike with interchangeable boyfriends and co-workers - but they're all good.....bg",1264636800,9,1328,4.331983805668016

Sure, it gets a bit mushy and 'chick flick' comes to mind in some of the episodes, but the hilarity of not only the characters, but the storylines can't be beat.

What I found as very entertaining 10 years ago I look back and reminisce how much of yesterday's issues are still current. The fact that it was able to poke fun at anything and not take itself TOO seriously made it work. And of course there were episodes with so much drama you just couldn't wait for the next episode. Watching them one after the other made me appreciate the change in the series. As the seasons continue you do notice the writing is not as great as that first one, but without commercials and having to wait weeks at a time gives you enough of a tug at the heart when you come to that last episode. Could it have been greater? Overall yes, only because that first season really defined it so well that it set that bar a lot higher than anyone could have hoped for. A delight then, a delight now. And considering the issues, it does make you think for whatever changes have occurred, are we any better off? Love defines who we are is what the show hinged on, and to some degree, I think we need a little Ally nowadays, to be able to laugh at ourselves now and again.",1261353600,,1214,4.170212765957447

And the guest cast is a who's who of TV and film.  Even if you were a fan of the show you will be amazed at the people who you forgot made appearances.  I expected to find watching this late 1990's era show to be dated.  It wasn't. (Well, except maybe the Blue Swede dancing baby.)

It's crazy, funny, and poignant.  The characters are so nuts that I feel better about my own idiosyncratic foibles.  David Kelley, creator and writer, really has a lock on the human condition.  The characters are not thin caricatures, but three-dimensional human beings. This series not only tickles the funnybone, it also makes one think.  Have fun!",1259712000,2,620,4.738317757009346

3277476,5,B000ZMCFIS,"So, we all either love or hate this show (which is something I've gathered from reading reviews online). Well, I'd have to say that I love the show which is surprising to me since I never really watched in the past. Probably because I was only 11 when it first came on the air.

The box set is extremely easy to navigate, compared to some other shows that are a bit of a hassle to get to the disc you want. The complete ALIAS is a really cool, original design--but you have to take a thing out, fold some things back, decipher which folder you want, then get the disc out of the cardboard sleeves. The complete BUFFY has a neat design as well, but the folders are stacked one on top of the other, so when you want season 7 you basically have to unload the whole thing. Both sets look cool, but are a bit of a pain.

The Ally McBeal set, on the outside, looks great and the cardboard case (both the slipcase and the inside one that holds the DVD sets) are sturdy enough since it'll just be setting on your shelf. Then you have the 6 DVD multi-cases sitting inside the box. Not much to look out, but I love these new ""multi-pack"" DVD cases--the ones that are just as big on the outside as a normal single DVD movie release, but they hold up to 6 DVDs. This is especially great if you want to A) just put the seasons on your regular DVD shelf or B) take a season with you, whether you're going to visit some folks, going on a plane ride, etc.

My only complaint--which almost made me give it 4--is that the set doesn't have anything in the way of an episode guide. I can find episode guides online, but it's nice to have a hard copy, and it wouldn't have cost too much to put even a flimsy little ""pamphlet"" style guide in each of the season sets. On the inside of each season case, there is what amounts to an episode list, breaking down which episode is on which disc--but it doesn't give the plot, air date, writer, etc. A booklet (like the ones released on the complete FRIENDS or GILMORE GIRLS sets) would have been great, but there's nothing like that in here.",1258156800,5,2063,4.204545454545454

As for the product itself...
I love Ally Mcbeal!  It used to be my favorite show to watch on TV every Monday.  I looked forward to the release of the series for so long.  It was very nice to see that finally all the seasons and episodes are in the same package all together.  It was also a nice bonus to see the collection of songs in the final disk.

However, I have to say, for a long awaited series dvd like Ally Mcbeal, I would've expected more from the packaging of the dvds and also the DVD menu.  Everything seems very basic.  The menu interface seems like it is something that is bootlegged.  Also, I would've expected more special features as well, (i.e. deleted scenes, gag reels, etc).  I like the collection of songs a lot, but the CD would've been even better if it had included the songs sung by Robert Downey Jr. as well.

Watching this on a 46 inch widescreen, instead of the TV tube of the 90's makes the whole experience, magical...as if one is seeing all these memories and many David E. Kelley's imaginative creations, in a theatre from a front row seat.

I highly recommend this experience for all Ally McBeal fans.

Thank you.
UPDATE:

Amazon won't let me do a second and updated review, since I already had written one when I first purchased. I can see why they have this policy now. After the consumer has had something for a while, the truth comes out and the truth on this DVD collection of my favorite show ever produced, it that it is sooooooo FLAWED!!!!! BEWARE!!! I an only on the third season and so far, 7 entire episodes have been defects. I have missed seeing all of them, even after gently washing and drying them. Now, everytime I hope to watch Ally, I am in dread that it will break up, as the past 7. The entire disc 2 on season 3, will go unseen my me as it is defective. As were others in season 1 and 2.

Kelley who I think is a genius, Ally McBeal was the hottest show thanks to a multi-talented cast and edgy, realistic writing. Calista Flockhart was brilliant and hilarious in the title-role, and who could rock those naughty mini-skirts in a law office like her?! Courtney Thorne-Smith and Lucy Lui also had wonderful comic timing, the last season was not so great but hey Ally McBeal was the ultimate dark comedy (and don't forget about that dancing baby and the unisex bathroom!) - highly addictive series!",1255478400,3,608,4.912621359223301

I bought Region 2 imports about 6 years ago and could only watch episodes on my laptop. I am beyond thrilled that this has finally been released in the US with all of the original music intact!!!! I was pleasantly surprised with the packaging. Every season's case is no bigger than a regular single dvd case and the dvds are sorted inside very nicely.

I already had the Ally McBeal soundtrack so the bonus cd wasn't terribly special, but it's always nice to have a backup. I haven't watched the bonus features yet. In the meantime, I'm enjoying reliving all the crazy antics of Ally, John, and everyone else who makes this show so unique and amusing. Thank you, Fox, for finally releasing this series on dvd. Amazon was also wonderful to work with. I originally paid $125 for the pre-order and they refunded $25 when the price dropped to $100. It arrived right on time and was packaged very well.

It's hard to believe season 1 came out in 1997 -12 years ago. I have to say this show ages really well.",1255046400,6,1216,4.448430493273543

All five seasons with original music - we were all so worried that it would not be done this way, but I was not disappointed at all.  I've only watched the first few episodes so far, but I can tell that it's just as I remember it...so funny and so quirky!  I am thrilled to have the entire series on DVD for Region 1.  I considered buying a bootleg copy online because I wanted it so badly!  If it takes 7 years to do it right, then 7 YEARS IT IS! Thank you Thank you Thank you FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT.
Also thank you to Amazon.com for the AWESOME pre-order deal and pricing.  I ordered the set when I first heard about it in July and ended up paying so much less than I expected for it(though I would have gladly paid more).

3277500,5,B000ZMCFIS,"""Ally McBeal"" is hands-down my favorite show of all time. I've literally been waiting more than a decade for the series to come out on DVD. I'm so thrilled to finally own this amazing boxed set, which is every bit as fabulous as I hoped it would be.

The best thing about the set is obviously the episodes themselves. They're completely unedited in any way, and yes, they do contain all the original music from the show, which is something fans were worried about. Let me tell you, watching Ally McBeal on my big flat-screen TV is absolutely fantastic! The boxed set itself is very nicely designed and encased in high-quality packaging, which I really appreciate. Best of all, the set comes with a bunch of extras, like a new ""Ally McBeal"" CD, the crossover episode from ""The Practice,"" featurettes, and more.

The only slight letdown is the soundtrack CD, which only contains one previously unreleased song. I own all the other ""Ally McBeal"" CDs, so this album really doesn't offer anything new, but I can live with that because I NOW OWN ""ALLY MCBEAL: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" ON DVD!!!

I then, of course, immediately ordered the entire series. I was (still am) a HUGE Ally McBeal fan. When I got the DVD's, I couldn't decide which episode's to watch first. I skipped around through the 2nd, 3rd and 4th season mostly cuz I missed my Nelle and Ling. But now that I have calmed down, I have started the series from the beginning of season 1. BUT, jumping around through the seasons at first made me realize how much I had forgotten about what happened in the series. Also, watching the first couple episode's of the 1st season made me feel like I was watching a new show all over again because it has been SOOO long since I have seen those episodes. This show still cracks me up and I'm so glad that I finally own it. I don't understand why they even bothered to just release the 1st season as well because I think all the Ally McBeal fans out there are just going to buy the entire series now. We've waited to long to wait for each season to have an individual release. lol!

Also, I see that Amazon already appears to be out of stock until Oct. 11th. That's gotta be proof that the public has been eagerly awaiting Ally McBeal's DVD release. And, yes, all the original music is in the show. It even has a sticker on the box that says that all the episode's contain their original music. Thank you Fox!!

I was surprised to receive it Tuesday, the official day of release, and surprised that it came in the sturdiest, best packaging of any series I've purchased. Even more pleasant to see was the label, right on the packaging, that the original music is all intact. Just to top it off, I got a large refund due to the significant difference between the price I ordered the series at (almost $180) and the Amazon price at the time of release (under $100). I haven't, obviously, had time to go through the discs to confirm the claim that the original music is all there -- but I think the worst fears of the series' fans have been allayed and the best hopes have been met.

Unlike some sets that repackage the same season discs in less resilient cardboard or paper sleeves that cause easy scratches, this set is simply the 5 single season release cases with a 6th case containing the bonus DVD and CD to even out the box.  I, for one, am a fan of this.  I bought it and was fearful of the insides of the box based on many other reviews I'd read of complete series sets arriving with unplayable discs.  The single season cases are very sturdy and what seems to be the standard now based on my recent purchases of Fringe, Supernatural, etc.

I should have checked on that inexpensive equipment prior to the purchase.  After receiving my set, I began my search for THE EQUIPMENT only to find it is expensive and much of it doesn't work well.  It appears that this equipment is not sold anymore at Best Buy or Target.  I did find some on AMAZON, but they were upwards of $70.00. Then, I Iearned about one week after I received my purchase, that Amazon was selling the Region 1 version!  Really bad timing!

3277510,5,B000ZMCFIS,"I love this show. I love it so much that when it was released on DVD in the UK I got copies imported to me and bought myself a region free player. It has been so wonderful having these shows when no one else in America does at the moment. It feels like my little secret. But I am worried over the state of the DVD's.

This set will be 32 discs. Originally I thought they'd just be rencoded versions of the British DVDs... That would have been more comforting. But here we get 5 seasons on 30 discs. The first season is full frame and the rest widescreen. Then disc 31 has a new retrospective featurette, and 5 or 6 vintage featurettes. Also an episode of ""The Practice"" when Ally crossed over and a music video.

The 32nd disc is curious. Fox has announced the set but has not stated if the music has been left intact. I can't see it being changed as a majority of the stories Need the specific songs chosen. They are not random. Also the characters mostly sing them live. It be practically impossible to change the music. Yet I am still concerned as this is fox and you would think they'd advertise the fact no music was changed... But disc 32 offers hope as it is a ""Best of Ally McBeal"" soundtrack. I am hoping these will be new songs not incorporated on the previous 4 albums released for the show.

The album included seems to be Fox's way of saying they too believe that the music was pivotal too the show. Quite recently Fox confirmed- that Yes= ALL OF THE MUSIC IS INTACT!This makes this a most have for anyone who loved this neurotic, short skirt wearing lawyer and her zany friends.

The soundtrack is the gigantic let down of this set. The press release led us to believe there would be previously unreleased music on this album. Bull****! For those of you who already have the other albums you will notice there is only one un- released song and that is ""I Know Better."" They had a huge opportunity to do something really great here and they blew it. Beyond that I will still buy this for the bonus material. The soundtrack listing is as follows.

3277511,5,B000ZMCFIS,"...not the product since that relies entirely upon the issue of the music that originally aired with the episodes. Special excerpts and clip collections are all we in the U.S.A. have seen of Ally McBeal on DVD up to now due to the large incorporation of popular music in the show. Many episodes of Ally had the closing ten minutes or so set in the bar where Vonda Shepard and guests such as Barry White would belt out popular, and unfortunately, copyrighted music. Also, the various characters would express themselves by dancing to popular tunes in a way that I just don't think would come across with muzak.

This has made DVD sets of entire seasons a licensing nightmare. Since Ally was in production from 1997 until 2002, just prior and a little bit after the advent of TV on DVD, this probably did not figure into the calculation of Fox as to how this would turn into a legal quagmire that could not be overcome. The same was true for ""WKRP in Cincinatti"" - the original masters of those shows with the music have been destroyed from what I hear - and then there also is ""Daria"".

Fox has been very tight-lipped about the status of the music that was woven irreplaceably into this show. Do you really think we could get this show for this price if the music was there? Based on Fox's past record of deleting music from TV shows and not telling anyone until after they collected their money, and given the state of the economy and the DVD market right now, I'd think they'd be telling the world if the music was intact. I also think they'd be telling noone if it was missing. So far their silence has been deafening. My opinion is to either wait until some definitive word comes out on the condition of these sets or maybe a compromise would be to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ally-McBeal-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000TGURZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ally McBeal: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;and see what was done there as indication of what was done with the other four seasons.",1247875200,82,2045,4.890489913544669

Kelley's brilliant writing and ensemble cast put so much life into the characters that you're laughing so hard in one scene and crying in another.  Break out roles were given to Calista Flockhart, Jane Krakowski, Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Lucy Liu that certainly broadened their careers.  Not to mention Vonda Shepard for her singing appearances and theme song, who was discovered by David E. Kelley and his wife Michelle Pfeiffer, or so I read somewhere.

I remember laughing out loud many nights at this wacky show. After doing some research I decided it may never come out in the US and began researching how to play other region DVD sets since this show was available for Region 2.

If you're thinking of getting this DVD set in Region 2 format, don't worry. Playing it in the US was not hard. The UK based region 2 DVD set is a PAL video format that must be converted to NTSC format to view on a US TV. Fortunately, this isn't hard. There are some DVD players available that do this conversion automatically. Your DVD player must also be multi-region or region free. A quick google search revealed some hacks that could be used to convert certain DVD players to region free.

I purchased a Phillips DVP 5982 at Best Buy. It took 30 seconds to type in the code using the remote that allowed me to have this player work with region 2 DVDs.  The video conversion worked like a charm without me doing anything.

Do your own research, but it isn't hard to watch the UK Region 2 DVD set in the US. I'm only sorry I waited so long to give this a try. I can't wait to watch more episodes.",1213142400,23,1283,4.178137651821863

The only criticism I have of the set is that there aren't enough extras. If you love dramedies don't miss the complete Ally McBeal.

If you're wanting to purchase this set and aren't seriously considering it because it's Region 2, think again!  Most (if not all) new DVD players can be ""hacked"" in order to change it to be multi-regional.  It's incredibly easy!  Try googling ""dvd region hack"" and look around for your DVD player.  It's well worth the little effort for me because I love so many British shows that aren't available in the US or they have Special Edition DVDs that have extras that we don't have.

As usual, David E. Kelly delivers characters that are your new friends for a while, personal and life issues to check in with. Getting used to some of the quirkiness wasn't so easy at first, especially for a man. Great musical guests including Al Green, Gloria Gaynor, and Barry White make the show well worth the investment. Especially good are performances from Lucy Liu, Portia de Rossi and Lisa Carson. One could go on and on with praise, the entire cast brought life to the well crafted Kelly characters.

A look back to a time when there were eMacs on desks survives just fine because the show deals with young adulthood, honesty and friendship more than the usual legal issues. There are still interesting court scenes. To other guys, there is a lot about this that is more for, well, put it this way, just hang in there - its very entertaining, fun, and it does keep the wife in a good mood!

Disc Set - One Star

Season three was badly damaged due to defective discs that have visible flaws such as tiny bubbles in the plastic. Other disks have a milky sort of film on them, especially those on the outermost layer of the season package. I was able to wash some discs to make them work, but the bad ones are worthless.

Right now, Season Four is very expensive. It is so expensive that it makes sense to just get Season Three as a separate season to complete the set and then just eat the cost.

It would be a good idea to check your discs carefully and then decide for yourself if you want to return or keep them. I plan to contact the publisher over this, because most of the price is for licensing not media - they need to make it right. If I make progress with the publiisher, Ill post back here. Amazon did offer to accept a return the set, but then we would have no way to assemble a set from some other method. If it ever comes up as an Amazon Video streaming purchase, that might be the best way to get this series (with my luck, it will be free on Prime next week).

One thinks that, given its first season, the series just could have been better.
