8606834,4,B00EMGR2CW,"Over 10 years ago, while on a cruise which stopped for a day in Barcelona, I wanted to see this cathedral which has been in progress for 125 years  and is still not completed. At that them there was part that you could visit on a tour but the lines were so long to get in that it was a two hour (or more wait) and I only had the one day to visit the city. But I vow to go back.

With this 94 minute documentary produced in 2012 I was able to gain some insight into the original creation and see the progress that was made since I was there. There are interviews with the chief architect, as well as the priest. And, yes, as another viewer pointed out, there are some political  remarks made that may, or may not be appropriate).

The narration in English is not the most exciting but at least you can understand it. The problem with this film  and its a shame that it was done this way  is that the interviews are all with people speaking the Cantalonian dialect of Spanish and the English subtitles are in white print. Since many scenes have a white or beige background it is often impossible to read the print. At those parts I just watched the images but I know I lost a lot because of this issue. This is a problem in many foreign films and YELLOW seems to be the best color for subtitles (or at least have the white letters bordered in black) but that color is rarely used.

I can still highly recommend this to anyone who has visited Barcelona and seen the cathedral. Especially if you did not take a tour or it has been many years.

For the casual person, I can only give it three star because of the subtitle issue.

The DVD does have about 20 minutes of extra interviews (again, mostly with subtitles).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8606835,2,B00EMGR2CW,"The film is well produced and interesting, EXCEPT in the disk we rented, many of the interviews featured people speaking Catalan Spanish (or at least I gathered that's what it was) and the subtitle translation to English was so small and washed out that the subtitles were mostly unreadable. Thus we missed what these important people had to say. If you turn on the ""hard of hearing"" subtitles, they are large, clear and very readable. Extremely frustrating and irritating. Perhaps newer disks might have cleared this up -- please log in with a reply if so.",1440115200,2,557,4.8125
8606836,3,B00EMGR2CW,"It is a fairly good documentary, but I was annoyed at it's rather subtle political bent and so will confine my review to that point.  The narration implies that Gen. Franco's forces destroyed Gaudi's models...they did not.  The were destroyed by the Marxist/anarchist (Republican) side.  They then imply that the dark forces of Franco was responsible for the murder of 22 monks of Montserrat Abbey, supposedly, as it is inferred, because the abbey continues to use the Catalonian language at Mass.  Again, the problem is it was not Franco, but Republican Marxist forces that carried out the executions of the monks, along with literally hundreds of other priests, brothers, nuns, etc. in Catalonia.  The documentary then glosses over the protest petition of the 1960's signed by Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto among others, without being specific as to the anti-Catholic nature of the petition.  It was the tenor of the times and the signers of the petition objected to such a large project involving so many artists for such a specifically Catholic purpose, as out of step with those times.  This was part of the idea that such a modern Cathedral, should really be dedicated as a sort of secular, or multicultural and multi-religious temple for all ""the people"".",1438905600,5,1261,5.0047846889952154

8606838,5,B00EMGR2CW,"The Baslica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Famlia, is a large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Catalonia, designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud. Construction started on March 19, 1882 and will go on for few more years. If you admire art, architecture, engineering and pure human dedication in creating a masterpiece for decades and decades, then this is the one to watch and follow. It is in a scale unknown to most humans since there is no such construction of magnificent artwork structure that started over a century ago and continuing on for few more years to come. The mass of the structure, the sheer intricate structural details, material used from all over planet earth in creating such architecture is simply mind boggling and unbelievable. This is the latest version of their progress. Well done documentary and an inspiration for one to insure to visit Sagrada Famlia and cherish human art and capability. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1434931200,6,946,5.031847133757962
8606839,4,B00EMGR2CW,"This film is a personal and inspiring visit to the devoted individuals who are continuing the construction of Antonio Gaudi's masterpiece.  The
viewer is shown some, but not all work done since Gaudi's death.  The film presents the Sagrada as an ongoing project. - a work in progress.  It shows the genuine love and respect felt by all those continuing to work enthusiastically toward its completion.  There are older films that visit the Sagrada and take you both inside and outside the cathedral and explain Gaudi's development as an architect .  Viewing such a film would introduce and prepare an individual for Sagrada : The Mystery of Creation.  It goes without saying, that an actual visit to the Cathedral itself would be the ideal introduction.  No other film takes you behind the current construction scene in real time as this film does.  Buy it.",1432512000,6,856,4.895833333333333
