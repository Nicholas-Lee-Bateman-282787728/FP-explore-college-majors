6228834,3,B00HVA3G80,I loved the dancing and acting is this movie. I have seen all the doom movies and the two characters that are irksome are A.C.P. Jax Dixit and Ali.,1401148800,3,147,4.103448275862069
6228835,5,B00HVA3G80,"Was holding my breath waiting on this one to come out. Wondered, ""How could they make another that would keep up with the pace of the first two; especially having Aamir Khan playing the role of the Villain, Or was he truly a villain or a victim of circumstance?"" Well so glad I waited and got the chance to see the third installment. Was well worth the wait. This is only my own personal opinion. As always, I tell everyone; use your own judgement. But if I am asked if it is worth seeing. I would gladly say YES!",1399939200,2,513,4.191919191919192
6228836,2,B00HVA3G80,"This is truly over-hyped movie by producers. Dhoom 1 and Dhoom 2 were way better than this.
The story is not really impressive and looses the grip of the audience at many places. Emotions have been added to the places when they were unnecessary.

Katrina has no role to play. Music is okay.",1399939200,2,290,4.471698113207547

6228838,5,B00HVA3G80,This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end. The songs are memorable too. Malang and Tu Hi Junoon were my favorites. It has wonderful acrobatic scenes. Aamir Khan also does a tap dance sequence. The story is memorable and filled with action scenes. I was on the edge of my seat through most of it.,1398384000,,303,4.333333333333333

6228848,5,B00HVA3G80,"Do watch the other two Dhoom movies. I love them all and each one gets better. The first is a lot like the Fast and Furious movies. You will get the background on the relationship between the Sheriff and the Deputy. The second is better quality than the first. It includes fabulous music that will have you dancing or wanting to learn how to. It will make you laugh and is full of more excitement and romance than the first. The third...I have to take a deep breath on this one. Music is good and different than the others, but it's the story that will tug at your heart and never leave you. Aamir Khan is so magnificent that you will swear it is two people and not one. We had to double check to be sure. I never tire of watching the movies (specially 2 and 3).",1469318400,,762,4.155405405405405

6228851,2,B00HVA3G80,"Seen both 1 and 2, now comparing them, I think the first two installments were made effortlessly.  Can't say the same about this one.  Personally like Aamir khan so can't blame him for any flaws in the movie.
This installment suffers from very poor script and screenplay and that alone is to be blamed.
The movie, got to admit, has one of the best cinematography and choreography I have seen. The actors try very hard to convince the audience this movie is worth the watch, however I personally regret watching it.
Casting has failed equally,  Aamir khan was not the right actor for this role, he physically does not fit the character, eventhough he is one of the best actors around performance wise. I give him credit for trying, love this guy, but this just was not his cup of tea!!",1463875200,,784,4.546099290780142

One of my favorite Aamir Khan films for both his acting performance and his best dancing, he looks great, the songs are great and Jai Dixit and Ali are both so charming, I have come to appreciate them in all 3 Dhoom movies. Regarding the plot holes in Dhoom 3, I am usually not so forgiving of movies coming out of Hollywood, but as a Bollywood flick, it is just forgivable fun.",1458604800,,433,4.228915662650603

6228858,5,B00HVA3G80,"I bought all 3 in the series, watched them all several times, and I must say... Dhoom 3 is the dhoomiest!  I like it a lot.",1450656000,,123,3.730769230769231
6228859,5,B00HVA3G80,"I have been a fan of the Dhoom movies from the first time I passingly heard the main theme. Out of the three I have seen, Dhoom 3 has to be my favorite for several reasons. Firstly, I thought it was better thought out than the previous (even if I love them so much). It was refreshing to see the ""villain"" of the movie having a reason to perform these grand heists. The storyline was superb and had me hooked within minutes. The English subtitles were much improved. It was much easier to understand the translation, and much is mostly due to it's success.

Growing up outside of Chicago, I was thrilled that the movie mainly took place ""in my home town."" It was extremely fun to pick out familiar landmarks and see them in full glory in a foreign film. I thought they did a brilliant job at highlighting some of Chicago's most beautiful features, as well as Chicago's early roots as an industrial hub (with the industrial tap sequence). It was also nice to see, what I perceived as, a few nods towards some of the great cop chases from The Blues Brothers movies. --It had me giggling like a small child. These factors even got my parents, who are not fans of Bollywood at all, to watch the movie. They thoroughly enjoyed it as well as I, even if upon first seeing Aamir Khan and our immediate thoughts were, ""When did Mr. Bean turn into such badass?!"" --Mind you, a very handsome and young Rowan Atkins.

The music is fantastic as always. There is not a single song that is not catchy. Every piece makes me want to get up and dance. The score is energizing and breathtaking. It leaves you in awe. The choreography? Absolutely stunning.

The only issues I had with the film, which are extremely minor, were a few things. One, being the $20 bill used. Those bills didn't come out until well after 1998. It's understandable though, considering it's extremely rare to come across an old $20. The other, was the dam. To my knowledge, we do not have dams like that in Illinois. We have locks, but those could never be confused with a damn. It's no biggie either, considering the ending is so heart wrenchingly beautiful. Lastly, and it wasn't that noticeable, was the apartment Jai, Ali and Victoria are in after Jai and Ali refuse to return to India. We don't have mountains in Illinois. Illinois is pretty much flat with the exception of some particularly large hills. There were a few other little discrepancies, but none of them are big enough plot holes to merit a lower rating.

Truthfully speaking, Dhoom 3 has easily become one of my favorite movies. It is never not a good day to watch Dhoom 3. The endearing nature of the film (no spoilers here, folks, sorry) leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy, while the total badassitude of the characters and plot has my full focus.

Plain and simple, this movie is frickin' awesome!

6228860,4,B00HVA3G80,"As I am a great fan of Aamir Khan, I had to see this movie.  The rave reviews didn't turn me on when they stressed the action, but then I was intrigued by the description of his human emotions, the quality that endeared PK, 3 Idiots, and Taare Zumeen Par to me.
So I started to watch and soon thought ""Oh no, a superhuman action sequence with unbelievable twists--I hate movies like this!""  But I stuck with it, and reviewers were right: in the second half, you are right there with the characters and their relationships to each other.  Not so many violent, incredible, impossible actions, and there were the many aspects of Aamir Khan, the amazingly versatile actor who draws you right into his feelings.  I can recommend it for that alone.",1449619200,,742,4.556390977443609

6228866,4,B00HVA3G80,"While it is the highest-grossing film in the history of Indian cinema, no one is going to call this a great film.  It is however a really fun one.

Aamir Khan plays a circus magician moonlighting as a thief determined to bring down the bank that foreclosed on his father.  Armed with some clever tricks, some amazing stunts, and a motorcycle James Bond would envy, Khan outwits Chicago police and taunts the pair of cops brought in from India to hunt him.  The action sequences are broken up by song and dance numbers from Katrina Kaif's stunning intro number, to a tour-de-force circus show, to a trippy love song.

There's not much here you haven't seen before, even the plot twists feel recycled.  Kaif's role is the typical 'item girl' she sings, she dances, she's the love interest but does nothing of great significance.  I've seen Bond girls with more depth.  The odd couple cops (the only hold overs from the other Dhoom films) never really manage to be more than the straight arrow and the slob.

But, somehow it works.  Khan's performance is the real highlight, much like Heath Ledger or Robert Downey Jr he raises this film from a forgettable diversion to something legitimately fun.  The musical numbers are suitably epic, the evil banker suitably evil.  Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun, and it shows on screen.

Dhoom 3 ain't great, it ain't deep, it ain't even too original, but y'know I'd rather watch this than another Transformers movie.",1432857600,2,1463,4.71259842519685

The only reason I gave it one star was that Katrina Kaif is absolutely stunning in the music videos. Other than that, I'll use the DVDs for TARGET PRACTICE, it stinks that much!",1422921600,,341,4.104477611940299
6228874,3,B00HVA3G80,"Third installment of the mega-hit Dhoom franchise, Dhoom: 3 stars Aamir Khan as Sahir, a star circus performer in Chicago with some secrets. Abhishek Bachchan is a police officer Jai Dixit, who is called in from India, together with his deputy Ali (Uday Chopra), when a series of bank robberies takes place.

First, you don't have to see the original Dhoom or its sequel to enjoy the third entry, which is a stand-alone film in spite of its title.

Dhoom 3 has two great things. One is the action stunts involving a unique motorbike, and the other is the acting skills of Aamir Khan, the charismatic star of Lagaan and 3 Idiots.

However, the film is far from perfect. The story (probably inspired by a certain Christopher Nolan film) is weak at best, and the film suffers from the unmemorable supporting roles, especially the female one.

Dhoom: 3 reflects the recent trend of the Hindi (if not the entire Indian) movies: more Hollywood blockbuster-like action set-pieces and less musical/dancing scenes, as a well as the on-location shooting outside India.

So, is it good? Yes, but not great. Dhoom 3 is certainly an entertaining movie, but not without some dull moments.",1422403200,5,1174,4.85
6228875,5,B00HVA3G80,"Well worth watching. Twice at least. Once when you don't know what's going to happen, and again when you do. Really cool the different perspectives. Why don't they make movies like this in America? PS. The English subtitles really help.

I've watched his other movies. This guy can act, dance and look sexy. He takes his roles seriously. I loved the serious face he had throughout the movie.

6228900,5,B00HVA3G80,"The Dhoom franchise keeps getting bigger and better with each installment. I have to be honest, I was a bit worried about how Aamir Khan would pull off Dhoom 3 as Hrithik Roshan's performance in Dhoom 2 was just AMAZING but he did a really amazing job. I also liked the fact that Jai (Abishek Bachchan) had grown as a police officer in the course of the movie and you could see his intelligence and his stength really come out in this movie. Ali (Uday Chopra) was his usual bubbly, stupid self but that's ok too as he was funny to watch with his little quirks and mannerisms.

I'm also glad that Dhoom 3 did not focus too much on the romantic angle and focused more on the adventure and action. The interesting twist to the story made this Dhoom movie intriguing and really re-affirms Aamir Khan as one of India's greatest actors.",1406073600,2,830,4.42483660130719

Their acting (if you can call it that) were painfully awful & as amateurish as the entire American cast in the movie. Katrina was relegated to an almost non existent role, other than the song and dance routines. The saving grace for Dhoom 3 (at the risk of being ""DOOMED"" 3)were the great song/dance numbers, some high octane action scenes and Aamir Khan's screen presence. If they were to make a fourth segment, please, get rid of Abshishek and Uday and simply replace them with, uh... perhaps some robotic androids? 3 stars purely on Aamir Khan's merit.",1401148800,8,820,4.864285714285714

Such a beautiful back story for the undecided antagonist of the film, and the ending will make sure you remember this wonder for a while. So many beautiful and bittersweet strands woven in this web of a fantastic spectacular for the eyes and soul to behold. Wonderful performance by Aamir Khan and I wish there were more scenes with Katrina Kaif. The second half of the movie brings us back into the world that is thrust upon us in the first arc of the story and will propel you throughout the beautiful story. It has left a mark on me making me want to come back to it soon.",1515283200,,685,4.532258064516129
8636325,5,B00HVA3G80,"I must admit a certain level of biasness as a Chicago native as that to date this Bollywood adventure has shot the city the best. The chase sequences of police racing after Aamir Khans bank robbingclown in the loop outdoes the thrills and cinematography of The Dark Knight(2008, Christopher Nolan). Yet for as much as Dhoom 3 draws from Nolans most revered Batman film, it also questionably pays homage to The Prestige (2006,Christopher Nolan) on multiple levels of dedication, deception, and permitted love. This Bollywood adventure of a magician avenging his fathers lost dream of creating an Indian circus centers around the themes of identity and heritage the center stage of Khans complex character.",1514419200,,704,5.184210526315789
