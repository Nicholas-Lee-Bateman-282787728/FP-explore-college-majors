8329590,5,B001O4C6QC,"Released in the USA as NAKED IN THE NIGHT, this film was advertised (and the VHS release still pushes this) as an ""adults only"" film, but except for three brief dance sequences (with pasties), it's mostly a crime film dealing with prostitution. As a crime film, it's quite good and well-acted by Eva Bartok and Sabine Sesselmann, the former as a lady trying to bust the racket, the latter as a sad victim of it. Heinz Drache, later in many German ""krimi"" films of the early 60's, does a fine job as a regular customer of the madam who isn't exactly what he seems. While the dubbing does not match the lips that well, the dubbed voices do a decent acting job and the dialogue is literate, so I had no problems with the post-synchronization. There is a fine Teutonic jazz score by Willy Mattes and moody, atmospheric photography. The credit sequence, with a speeding car careening down the street with the credits flying toward the screen, culminating in a car crash, started the film off with a bang, and the pace is kept up well throughout. In the late 1950's and the early 1960's, many foreign melodramas with a sexual element were marketed as ""adults only"" films in the USA. This brought a number of excellent films here that might not have gotten a US release otherwise, but gave the films the stigma of being tedious nudist or sex films, which many were not (thankfully, there are no American nude inserts here!). Despite the VHS cover NAKED IN THE NIGHT as a nudist or sex film, this is really a German crime film, and as such it's recommended to those who would want to see a Teutonic white slavery melodrama.",1524355200,,1615,4.553264604810996

In this release of ""Naked in the Night"" a first viewing will probably leave you puzzled.  Somebody transposed the order of the film and you'll have to re-arrange the plot on your head.  This is plain inexcusable!  They ought to be ashamed at Alpha Home for pushing crap like that.  On the other hand both the video and sound are acceptable and you find yourself wondering what could have been if the manufacturer had exercised a little tender loving care on the product.

You see, ""Naked in the Night"" without being classic fare is an interesting 1958 West Germany production dealing with call girls, prostitution and the complexities of love and friendship. I suspect that the producers just aimed at a quickie sex-exploitation film for the drive-in crowds.  This is back in the days when the film industry was experimenting with a more relaxed censorship which allowed the handling of taboo subjects and the showing of more bare skin. In this movie the only naked person is an exotic dancer who does her thing topless. Surprisingly, ""Naked in the Night"" boasts a sensible script, sensitive direction by actor-director Kurt Meisel and excellent performances by the beautiful Eva Bartok and the rest of the cast resulting in  a film that will capture your interest and leave you satisfied. If only they would provide a restored, re-mastered version....and yes, with all the scenes in the proper order! By the way, the notes on the case describe Miss Bartok as a German actress... actually she was Hungarian.",1252713600,3,1515,4.913725490196079
8329594,3,B001O4C6QC,"NAKED IN THE NIGHT (aka ""Madeleine Tel. 13 62 11"" in it's native Germany) is a good but not outstanding exploitation thriller set in the world of high-class hookers and their corrupt managers.

Criminology student Karin (Sabine Sesselmann) goes undercover as a call-girl when she discovers that her old school chum Madeleine (Eva Bartok) is mixed up in the shady prostitute ring run by opportunistic Madam Clavius (Ilse Steppat).  It's a thin plot but the performances are fine.  The English-language dubbed version is quite excellent, with only marginal differences in the original dialogue.

The print featured on Alpha's DVD is very basic, with lots of duping and haze.  I've got a sneaking suspicion that a couple of reels are out of order too, because the movie doesn't make sense in a few scenes (eg: Madeleine and her boyfriend break up and in the next scene they go on an outing together; and there's no scene where Karin approaches Clavius for a job).  However, you can still follow the story so it's not a big issue in the long run.

Good title for Eva Bartok and ""krimi"" fans.",1242432000,5,1087,4.780748663101604
