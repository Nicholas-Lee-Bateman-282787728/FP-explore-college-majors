4859008,5,B005QIOKAC,"Bob Harper's ""Complete Body Power Transformation,"" is almost non-stop exercise, with Mr. Harper moving quickly from one exercise to another.  There's hardly any time to rest, although he does give you a little pause here and there. He instructs a group of two men and two women.  Two sets of dumbbells are used.

Total workout time (about 1 hour)

Warm-up (about 2 minutes)
Cool-down and stretches (about 5 and 1/2 minutes)

Workout (about 52 and 1/2 minutes): So intense & long, this is hard to do in one session, especially if one is doing it for the first time.  If you have difficulty completing the workout, here's a little tip: break it into two parts, rest, eat something and do modifications.  That's what I did.

""Bob Harper: Total Body Transformation"" DVD actually contains two workouts.  I already reviewed the first one in the above paragraphs.  Here's the second one, ""Body Power Quck Bonus"". One dumbbell is used.

Workout (under 13 and 1/2 minutes):  This one starts out with a bang, by running in place, which serves as the warm up.

Compared to the longer workout, this shorter workout was easy, but I did avoid doing the Turkish get-ups which I alway find uncomfortable to do.",1323648000,46,2719,4.848156182212581
4859009,5,B005QIOKAC,"I have been exercising 6 days a week, 1 hour per day, for about a year and a half and have kept off over 44 pounds in so doing. I have four of Bob's other DVDs and have purchased and done 15 others of varying intensities and types (cardio, yoga, Pilates, weights, core, etc), as well as doing long-distance walking and hiking in good weather. This is BY FAR the hardest workout I have ever done-even the 10-minute quickie routine left me having a near-Rafael Nadal moment in my living room. I *thought* I was in pretty good shape but this DVD proved otherwise. Not recommended at all for anyone who is a novice exerciser or anyone with serious knee issues as there are NO options given to the moves. Also I would like to see the Geneva Convention take a look at the Turkish get-ups because they are brutal.",1322524800,99,806,4.38
4859010,4,B005QIOKAC,"Is this the toughest workout I've ever done? no. Is it the toughest workout Bob Harper has put out? Yes. After recently buying Billy Blanks new DVDS this one is not quite as demanding cardio wise. I have all of Jillian DVDS and P90x. The around the world push-ups are difficult. Ilove/hate the variation of lunges with lateral raises. In the workout there are also biceps and shoulder presses while stuck in a squat, weighted jumping jacks, dive bombers, plyo squats, variation of cable flies, and more. At the end of the workout there is a bridge series that really burns. He mentions you can add a weighted ball or a tennis ball between the legs, that really engages the inner thighs and makes the glutes burn so much more. The ten minute workout is really about 14 minutes with a minute stretch. In this workout the toughest moves are the scorpion push-ups into a manuver where you reach for your foot. Also he makes you do sets of low jumping jacks into chair pose hold. BURNS. Great workout!",1322438400,25,996,4.569832402234637
4859011,5,B005QIOKAC,"I wanted to add some variety to my Bob and Jillian DVD set and this certainly fit the bill.  I liked that it was 60 minutes, made me sweat and gave me a great overall workout.  While I know that we've seen a lot of these moves before, they haven't been in this combination which makes you think and works the muscles differently.  I continue to be a big fan of Bob and he definitely does not disappoint!",1322438400,3,403,4.141025641025641
4859012,3,B005QIOKAC,"Let me start off by saying that I did like this workout and plan on putting it into my rotation.  However, many of the moves are ones that you have seen in Bob's other workouts and from The Biggest Loser workouts (weighted arm swings, scorpion push-ups, sumo squats, squat with bicep curls, prisoner lunges, etc).  There are some new moves added in (around the world push ups, russian kicks).  I would have liked to see a few minutes of ab work at the end.  Overall, a good workout, but I feel it's one that could get boring after a while.",1322265600,7,539,4.36
4859013,5,B005QIOKAC,"Once again Bob delivers. This workout rocks. Very good core workout and cardio conditioining. Very challening, for more advanced participants, You will not be disappointed with this workout.",1322179200,,190,5.821428571428571
4859014,5,B005QIOKAC,"Bob is one of my favorite trainers because he keeps you moving. If you have done his Inside Out Method training DVDs you will get some of the same movements with a few wrinkles thrown in. As you know, Bob believes in keeping a dumbbell or a set of dumbbells in your hands for about 85% of the workout. With a weight you will perform swings, shoulder presses, rows, bicep curls, weighted squats, weighted jumping jacks, lateral raises and maybe a few more. However, it's the moves without weights that are the real killers on this DVD. You will do planks, dive bombers, around the world push-ups and planks, burpees and a few other goodies I probably forgot. Bob calls it the hardest workout ever, but while it is challenging it doesn't come close to Insanity and Insanity Asylum.

I find Bob and Jillian workouts to be good intermediaries if you are graduates of P90X, Insanity, Insanity Asylum or TurboFire. All of these are extreme cardio workouts and you need to take a break before beginning your next session of the month(s) long sessions of these programs. And I think Bob Harper fits the bill for us amateur athletes who want to be challenged when we workout. Even if you are a beginner you can do this program with some modifications and by timing yourself. So instead of doing the entire hour long program, you can begin with 15 or 20 minutes until you work your way up. You can also begin with lighter weights and perform the pushups on your knees. As always Bob's music is not the greatest and sometimes the timing within the group is off. But I really don't care about stuff like that as long as the overall workout is good and challenging.

Finally, you should check out Bob's own website at [...] to see if the DVD is cheaper. It is available now via his website so you can order it and get started. I don't think you will be disappointed.",1321488000,7,1853,4.4955489614243325
4859015,1,B005QIOKAC,BORING. Maybe I just am not into the style of this work out video but it was so boring. i did once and won't do again. I prefer jillian micahaels 30 min interval videos. They keep it moving,1466467200,,189,4.0

He's more of getting more reps in but don't think it's a cakewalk at all! You will work from start to finish for an intense burn. Sometimes I had to switch out to a lighter weight but I challenged myself if I ever used a heavy one. With his motivation, you will transform the whole body and love every minute of it!",1461715200,,486,4.236559139784946
4859019,5,B005QIOKAC,"When you think of Bob Harper you think biggest loser and mildly challenging workouts. This is definitely not that.  This is a very challenging workout that allows you to modify to your ability with the size of the dumbells you use.  After a month and a half, I am still working on getting all the way through this without taking breaks.",1461110400,,336,4.491803278688525
4859020,2,B005QIOKAC,"I do a lot of Jillian Michaels videos and thought I'd mix it up a bit and try a bob harper video. I am only giving it two stars because it focuses so much on arms! As a woman, I feel like Jillian really gets it when it comes to the parts of my body that I need to focus on, and Bob doesn't. Just my opinion, but his moves aren't very exciting or different and I get bored with the old moves i have done since the 90's.",1459987200,,418,3.707865168539326

4859026,5,B005QIOKAC,What can I say? This is an awesome workout. Bob has given me a new appreciation of cardio. I am dripping with sweat the entire DVD. I know using a modifier is helpful but I am glad he does little modification to this workout. It really pushes me to do each exercise with the proper form to get the best results.,1453420800,,311,4.114754098360656

4859034,5,B005QIOKAC,Tough workouts but very good,1436572800,,28,4.8
4859035,5,B005QIOKAC,"First, a little background about me since I find it helpful when I read reviews for exercise DVDs: 41-year-old man who's in good shape and would be considered intermediate to advanced. I workout and run six to seven times a week. I can keep up with the performers in these videos.

I previously bought Bob Harper's Inside Out Method and they quickly became some of my favorite workouts.  Both the Strength and Cardio workouts in that series are hard, non-stop, hour-long cardio routines.  And while I still enjoy them I was looking for a little more variety so I picked up Bob's set of four DVDs, which included this one.

First, I found this workout to be a notch below the Inside Out Method with regards to intensity, but it is still a great workout that I use often.  The first half uses the weights a lot for upper body work - shoulder presses and curls, but you eventually transition to lower body work - lots of squats and lunges.  There's no doubt by the end that I've gotten a full body workout.  The workout is thought out and you get a sense of progression - like you are working towards something, whether it is the next, more difficult move or the end of the workout.

I also like that the mini workout included isn't simply an easy, beginner's version, but rather attempts to make you work hard in a short period of time.  It's a nice workout for days when I don't have an hour to workout.

For me, Bob puts together the best hour-long total body workouts that I've found.",1430438400,,1485,4.426470588235294

4859039,5,B005QIOKAC,"this is a really great, intense, full body workout. You use weights and the first few times I did them, even though I regularly work out, I could only do half the DVD. My husband and I both loved this DVD and it has become a staple in our workout routine. You do seem to work your arms more than other parts of your body, but we really love this work out.",1424476800,,355,3.9444444444444446
4859040,5,B005QIOKAC,"This workout DVD is for anyone who prefers a nice combination of weights and cardio.
Heavy weights not required unless you prefer it,  you'll still get a good workout because you will have weights in your hands at least 75% of the workout. You'll feel the burn either way.

I wear a heart rate monitor when I work out and the first workout on this DVD helped me burn 712 cals in that one hour. Very impressed.
I was nice and sore the following morning, but nothing too painful. I can definitely tell what muscle took a beating.

I absolutely love the flow and speed of this workout.  I've done Insanity several times before and while it's an amazing program as well, I found it too be too hectic. Too much going on.

I ordered more B.H DVDs, I'm a new covert :)",1421625600,2,761,4.293706293706293

He constantly challenges you physically and mentally and keeps you entertained. I usually use heavy weights to workout but have found only 15 lb Dumbbells ideal for these workouts to do it the whole time. Not only are his workouts breaking the plateau  but he is adorable and keeps your attention the whole time :)",1417478400,2,469,4.517647058823529

4859044,5,B005QIOKAC,"Bob Harper is relentless in this DVD, and I love it.  He makes me work harder than I thought I was capable of, and he seems to ""know' just when to say something encouraging (actually insulting), to get you back on track for the final reps.

I consider myself a healthy individual and I still struggle to complete all moves on the video. But thats the fun of Bob. You start off with a challenge and then you notice yourself getting stronger with more endurance over time. This video is not recommended for beginners in my opinion- things get intense.

I'd said this one--Bob Harper: Total body Transformation--pushed my workout to a brand new level. This DVD has more challenging movements that the other two do not have, including ""around the world push-up"", ""side burpess"", and others. These movements are definitely for people in advanced level because you will really need to be in a good condition in order to perform every movement well (and gain the best results).

4859062,5,B005QIOKAC,"I have only just completed this workout today for the first time, and as Bob repeats multiple times on the dvd, this is the hardest workout he's ever done.  I'd also like to say, this may also be the hardest workout I've ever done.

I am not a beginner, I've been training 5/6 times a week for the last 7 months.  Starting with a full cycle of 30 Day Shred, followed by 4 weeks of Ripped in 30.  I've got loads of Jillian Michaels DVDs (including No More Trouble Zones & Banish Fat Boost Metabolism) and some other Bob DVDs. I like to design custom weekly workout schedules rotating all of their workouts to vary my daily workouts.  In addition to this, last month, I completed the full 60 day routine of the intermediate level of Rushfit.

Bob's workouts are tough, most are around an hour long.  This one is 60 minutes but that includes warm up and cooldown.  I had to pause the dvd after 40 minutes and again at 50 minutes, something I hardly ever have had to do.  I was drenched in sweat.  In my opinion, this is tougher than the Inside out workouts or the ultimate cardio body.  For anyone who feels they may not be up to this challenge, try out his Beginners Weightloss Transformation DVD. It's in no way for beginners but on balance it's a bit easier than the others (probably just because it is only 45 minutes long). Next time, I don't want to need to pause the DVD, that's something to aim for...",1373673600,2,1406,4.32824427480916

I wanted some DVDs for vacation and the days I can't make it to a gym class. I have tried many and this is the first that was REALLY challenging, not boring, but still fun. For me it actually compares to a real class.

I know many prefer Jillian but I find her style a bit posey and her workouts not as challenging as this one.  His bantering seems more sincere and its actually motivational to see the guys try and sneak breaks or just give up!

Total Body is a tough 1 hour workout that tests your strength and endurance.  I prefer this routine much more than Insanity or P90X.  It is easy to follow and fun though painfully tough in a good way.  If you do this everyday and follow a healthy diet plan (e.g., eat ""clean"" and stay away from processed foods) you'll see results in the first 2 weeks.

I found it difficult to maintain the static contractions that Bob insists on, but at the same time I did not feel like I was getting much exercise from this workout, especially in the cardio department. Bob's cueing and couting are awful, as usual. While I do have some of his other vids in my rotation, this one does not make the cut.",1365465600,2,546,4.415841584158416

General Comments
This is a solid hour of moderate to very tough exercise.  There are no breaks and not much in the way of transitions.  The instructions on each move go by quickly so you may have to rewind to get the correct form.  The people in the class occasionally have trouble following the directions too and some struggle to complete the harder moves. The only modifications are not to use the weights.  In order to be done as designed, the workout requires about ten square feet of space (Around the World Pushup).  I don't have that so I put my knees down in the middle.

What I Liked
- There is a lot of workout packed in here, maybe not the toughest ever but a good deal for the price.

- There are some moves or variations on old moves that I hadn't seen before.

- The bridge series at the end really went after my hamstrings, which a lot of workouts hardly touch.

- It uses mostly body weight and a couple of dumbbells, not much equipment.

- There are a number of different types of exercises here: strength, stretching, plyo, and isometric.

What I Didn't Like
- There is a long sequence where you're holding your hands behind your head, elbows back.  I found that this tended to push my head forward, putting strain on my neck, so I decided to put my hands over my ears instead.

- The exercises flow quickly from one to the next allowing little time to change to a lighter or heavier weight.  For this reason I'm tending to use lighter weights than with P90X.

- Considering that he was only doing a small fraction of the exercises himself, I grew weary of Bob's macho attitude and I felt a bit sorry for Angel, who was having trouble with some moves.",1364688000,4,1845,4.363636363636363
4859072,5,B005QIOKAC,I use this dvd for cross training on my off days of running.  It really challenges your whole body and excellent for cardio also.,1362873600,,129,4.375
4859073,5,B005QIOKAC,"I am not sure I would call this the toughest workout ever, but it definitely is difficult and will push you.  I really like Bob's style.  I love a hard workout but due to an prior injury I need to be careful with my knees and this is intense without taking you totally off the ground a lot.  What I like about Bob's workouts are that instead of making you jump like crazy he makes you hold poses forever which to me is a lot harder and that is why I love it.  I have done this a couple of times now and it is intense.  If you want to make it crazy difficult then increase the weights.  The workout is broken into what I would call segments that repeat and the 2nd round is a little more difficult.  I really enjoy this workout and man do I sweat like crazy.  If you are looking for a challenge this one should not disappoint.  I love his style and I am glad I finally got around to do this one because it definitely is one of my favorite now.",1362441600,,942,3.9680851063829787

4859075,4,B005QIOKAC,"So I'm not a novice to exercise, I am a huge Jillian Michaels workout DVD fan, and I run, walk, and lift weights regularly.  I did 30 minutes out of the 60 minute workout (I only had 30 min before I had to get ready for work).  It was hard, let me tell you!  In order to set yourself up for success for this DVD, I would suggest getting two sets of hand weights.  For females I would suggest one set around 3 lbs, and the other set maybe around 6-8 lbs.  I also would suggest not doing this DVD if you have  knee problems as there are a lot of squats done in this video.  Last tip:  Make sure that you have a bottle of water nearby and some space (about 10 feet).  Most  of the moves can be done easily in not a lot of space (about 6 ft or less), but within the first 30 minutes of the DVD there are side burpees which do require more space.  This is a good DVD for those that hit a plateau with their workout and fitness regime and want to challenge themselves and try something new.  Just do the best you can with the DVD, I have decided to split up the 60 minute workout into two 30 minute segments.  It is tough and hopefully I will be able to build up to doing the DVD all the way through.  Even the people in the video (other than Bob) looked like they were struggling  A LOT, so that is definitely helpful and motivating.",1360368000,,1328,3.977272727272727

I now favor shorter but much more intense cardio + strength training in one type routines.  This workout is absolutely killer, but don't let that discourage you. Start by doing what you can and build up.  I highly recommend this video and anything Bobby or Jillian Michaels produces.  They have a sensible and efficient approach to weight management.  One caveat though, where it says 2 workouts included, I mistook that for two complete workouts. The second is actually a shorter work out for when you're strapped for time. It's useful, but you'll want to have a few more videos in your library to keep from getting stale.  Worth the money for sure, though.  Also, I picked up his Kettlebell DVD.

And there is not much in the way of cardio, so I didn't burn many calories (according to my heart rate monitor.)  I'm glad this was inexpensive b/c I don't think I'll be doing it many more times.

Jillian's DVDs tend to be more focused on a higher heart rate, where as this was focused more on strength with a moderately high heart rate.

4859089,5,B005QIOKAC,"I have completed P90x, Insanity, Asylum, and Jillian's new workout program and this is probably one of the best videos I have done.  I think it does a great job of combining what I like from all the other programs.  P90x is great for strength training, but is very slow paced and doesn't incorporate a lot of multiple muscle groups at once.  Insanity and Aylum is great for cardio and plyo training, but does little for strength.  Jillian's is a good mix of cardio, plyo and strength that works multiple muscles at once, but I found parts of it to be too easy.

This workout provides all of the positives of the above programs.  You will use weights throughout along with a variety of push ups so you get the strength.  At the same time you will incorporate multiple muscles at once like lunges with lateral raises or squats with cable fly.  There is no stopping or waterbreaks in this video either, instead when he wants you to rest you run in place or do weight jumping jacks (this may seem like it is not a break, but compared to what else you are doing you will be thankful).

My only complaint is the last ten minutes of the video.  You will focus on your hamstrings and butt which is fine, but it seems like a let down after what you just went through.  I like to finish a workout strong, and not on a ten minute bring your heart rate down routine.  I would have liked some ab work placed here instead.

I highly recommend the video it will push you to the limit doing exactly what he says throughout offering a way to get off your plateau that you may be in.  You will be pouring sweat by the end.

PS poor Angel, having watched him in the Core video he just can't keep up.  Did he even consider training for this?",1339718400,30,1721,4.265432098765432

This is my first Bob DVD and it whooped my butt. I finished but had to take several breaks and could not keep up with his pace.

If you're already in pretty good shape and wish to take on a challenge this is a pretty good one to try.  But I wouldn't recommend this for beginners or people with joint problems.  Unless you know how to modify the moves, the jumping and swinging will make the problem worse.

One thing I really don't like about the video is that the people are always out of sync.  They don't follow Bob's cues and were all doing their moves in different rhythms.  I decided not to look at them and just listen to Bob's voice.  That helped to prevent distraction and allowed me to focus on good forms.

I like Mr. Harper's motivation method more than Tony Horton's.  Tony is kind of funny.  His mantra is ""Do your best and forget the rest"".  But, he comes off like ""Do your best and forget the rest, but if you give a little less than its o.k."".  Bob Harper challenges you throughout the videos to not give up.  Sometimes he shames you into not giving up.

Cooldown

This was difficult for me because I used heavier weights than what Bob recommended, so I didn't keep up with the people in the video but it's hard enough.  I like that he brought back a few oldies (side burpees, russian kicks, around the world pushups) from his other DVDs.",1325635200,7,3118,4.583482944344704
4859103,5,B005QIOKAC,"This is another tough workout in the My Trainer Bob series.  This video is aimed at intermediate to advanced level exercisers who like interval training.  This workout mixes strength straining, plyometrics, and cardio endurance.  There are two workouts on this dvd, a 60 minute workout and a 14 minute workout.  This workout feels very similar to the other workouts in the series (a plus for me because I have quite a few of the workouts in this series and enjoy most of them).  There is a countdown timer (a feature I like quite a bit).  This workout requires hand weights (light and heavy).  There is some high impact exercises so this could be tough for anyone with knee issues.

Is this the toughest workout ever?  No, but this is a very good workout that will touch all the major muscle groups and is sufficiently difficult to challenge even an advance exerciser. The pace is relatively quick and the workout doesn't drag by.  Cueing is done well and proper form is shown.  If you like Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, Amy Dixon, Jackie Warner, or Cathe then you will probably enjoy this workout.  If you liked the other dvds in this series, you will probably like this as it feels very similar.  All in all, this is a well produced and tough workout.

That being said, it's still very hard. I like the incorporation of the weights and heart rate was up much of the time.  As a side note, why did Bob include that guy Angel? He was almost pathetic at times, falling on the floor moaning and groaning.

4 stars because I felt the end some ab work would have been better than the hamstrings.  Overall, highly recommended",1527552000,,506,4.538461538461538

I finished it, quite an achievement. Very different from other videos, very very good workout. Bob is a great trainer, Highly recommend this video for people looking to push it.",1489795200,,346,4.338461538461538

8483491,4,B005QIOKAC,"Oh boy.  Bob screams repeatedly in this DVD that it's the HARDEST.  WORK OUT.  EVER.  And he may be right!

I've seen lots of people in their reviews say that they were under the impression that Bob Harper was the ""nice one"" based on watching The Biggest Loser.  It almost seems like Bob wants to break that image in his work outs.  He is utterly UNRELENTING in this DVD, but this DVD is the best I've ever seen out of him as a trainer.  He is not abusive nor discouraging in this DVD like he is in others (he is not very encouraging at all in Pure Burn Strength).  He is very straight forward in this DVD--not extremely motivating, but he isn't constantly talking about how YOU SHOULD BE DYING RIGHT NOW or YOUR ARMS SHOULD BE SCREAMING.  I don't find that kind of talk very helpful.

That being said, this is a very, very good DVD.  My heart rate was through the roof every time I did this DVD and I finished every time with absolutely soaked work out clothes and hair.  I am in pretty good shape--I do Jillian Michaels and other Bob Harper work outs, but this one is a beast.  The sections with the weights are tough, the side burpees are ridiculous and oh man.  The around the world push ups.  I have never known such agony in all my life.

The warm up for this DVD is really very disappointing.  Bob is not great with his warm ups--he does a lot of static stretches and it's barely even a minute.  If you are someone who pulls muscles or who is very tight, you will want to supplement.  As usual, for whatever reason, Bob is OBSESSED with shoulders.  His favorite move that he uses a million times in every work out is that overhead press.  My shoulders are in absolute INSANE shape, but he really doesn't do much with biceps or triceps so I feel like I look kind of weird right now with these hugely ripped shoulders and kind of wimpy arms.

This is also not the greatest work out for abs or lower body.  That's the one thing I wish Bob could work on--it'd be nice if he had a rhyme or reason to his work outs.  Sometimes it just seems like he does random things for a random period of time.

Bob does a lot of counting, but sometimes his counting is wrong.  He'll be going TEN, NINE, EIGHT and I'm thinking OH THANK GOODNESS almost done and then he stops to go on a ten minute monologue about how you need to keep pushing.  Ten seconds later he's going SEVEN, SIX.  Well, by that point I'm dead.

Bob also really shoulder consider having some modifiers.  I end up modifying some of the moves until I can work up to that harder pace.  For someone who isn't an experienced exerciser, this lack of modifier can be very frustrating.  That's what I love about Jillian--she always modifies and when she doesn't, you know she means business.

The two girls and Casey were great.  I was especially impressed with Casey--he really powered through the whole time!  I've noticed the male exercisers in Bob's DVDs are usually the biggest wimps.  Speaking of wimps, dude, Angel, get your act together.  His body is in insane shape and he CANNOT keep up.  He's not as bad as Zach from the Total Cardio work out, but he is a big baby--collapsing to the floor and slamming his fist on the ground dramatically.

I really like the ten minute work out.  And yeah, those scorpion push ups are horrible and turkish get ups should be illegal based on sheer cruelty.

The first few times I did this DVD, I was really not enjoying myself.  I find a lot of Jillian's DVDs to actually be a lot of fun, but this one was NOT fun at all.  As I got doing it more and got better at it, it became more fun.  I completed the hour long work out about twenty times and the ten minute one about five.  You WILL see results with this DVD, no question.

A little aimless, but if you want a great work out that will keep your heart rate up while building muscle, consider grabbing this one!",1472774400,,3858,4.2797783933518
