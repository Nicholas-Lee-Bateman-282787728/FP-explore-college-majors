8056576,5,B000929VCC,"Just trust me. If you like Kung-fu movies enough to find this review, buy this movie. It has a special feature called ""Literal Translation"", and in fact all of these Shinobi B quality DVDs have it, but this has the only GOOD one. It's a must buy for any martial arts movie collection just for the unique special feature. Probably don't waste your money on the other three. It's worth just buying the A Way Out DVD for a collection. These are some low quality movies.",1347148800,,466,4.430232558139535
8056577,1,B000929VCC,"The Shinobi series, from Vol. 1 to whatever volume available in the market now, they're all B-movies from Japan. The acting is like that of students  who are still attending an acting school. The special effects are jokes. The plot is typical of any movies like this.

If you love Ninja or Japanese style sword-fighting movie, you should watch Shinobi - Heart Under Blade. It's a real movie shown in theatre with well-done special effect and a love story.",1172966400,,455,4.746835443037975
