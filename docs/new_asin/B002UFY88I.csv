3990996,5,B002UFY88I,"Lords Of Nature: Life in a Land of Great Predators is not a documentary.  It is a powerful argument for the importance of large predators in the wild.  For example, gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park do not exist solely to add to the enjoyment of photographers and visitors.  The presence of gray wolves has effected an entire ecosystem, from the obvious (elk, coyotes), to the less obvious (aspen and willows), to... everything else (beaver, songbirds, insects, nutrient flow, stream bank stabilization, water temperatures for fish).

Understanding these connections, then, allows the producers to explore the presence (and absence) of large predators in other locations, including mountain lions in Zion National Park and gray wolves in Minnesota.

This is a very inexpensive DVD, and people are encouraged to use it in public showings with a panel of experts to discuss the management (and mismanagement) of large predators.

Highly recommended.",1264032000,3,954,5.369127516778524

Outstanding for HS education; explaining the limits of population dynamics per Common Core Standards. Good example food web shown about 30 minutes in, a follow up from earlier explanation in the video.",1474156800,,278,5.488372093023256
8381202,5,B002UFY88I,"Excellent research and a heads up on our devastating public policies and human perceptions of the past and still carried on by our Fish & Wildlife state departments ""harvesting policies"" mainly caused by human overpopulation and encroachment on our wildlands.",1467072000,,259,5.5
8381203,5,B002UFY88I,"This program teaches an important ecological lesson.  It depicts so clearly what happens to ecosystems when top predators are removed.  ""Lords of Nature"" is one of my all-time favorite programs.  It is highly entertaining.  I think every high school student in America should see this!  It is a must-see for everyone who is interested in the environment.  5 Stars and more!  A++++",1425600000,,380,5.032258064516129

8381205,5,B002UFY88I,"Great DVD, unbiased account of the need of top predators, namely the wolf, in our ecosystem.  Any one thinking that the wolf is something to be shoot and done away with needs to watch this documentary.",1390608000,,201,4.583333333333333
8381206,5,B002UFY88I,Great explanation of value to top predators by scientists studying them. Everyone should see this DVD and pass it on.,1362528000,,117,4.9
8381207,5,B002UFY88I,"It seems that wolves will be fighting for their lives forever. This documentary explains the concept of the Trophic Cascade, or the supreme importance of the role of an apex predator in the wild. With good science and a straight forward, nonjudgemental approach, the narrator explains why wolves have been so reviled in the past, why they have successfully restored much of the natural balnce in Yellowstone National Park and why this is important. The work of conservationist Aldo Leopold is featured along with the honest challenges felt by ranchers in the west. Their effort to work toward a solution that benefits all promotes a fragile optimism.",1359676800,,650,5.08411214953271
8381208,5,B002UFY88I,This film is a scientifically sound ecological study of Wolves and other predators.  It is very well made and thoroughly covers the topic as well as emphasizing the importance of the subject.  I truly believe that everyone living in a region where these magnificent creatures live should watch this film.,1330560000,,304,5.06
8381209,5,B002UFY88I,"I purchased and presented Lords of Nature at my Organization (WRCNU.org) last week (Nov 2011). It was a huge hit; VERY informative and an easy/educational watch even for ""mature"" children.  I am now going to purchase more DVDs for Christmas gifts and as always go to Amazon first--AMAZON you are missing the boat by not having this fantastic educational DVD in your selection for purchase! Going back to the Lords of Nature site to find my DVDs...",1321056000,,447,4.805194805194805
8381210,5,B002UFY88I,"Everyone should see this film.

I once knew a hunter who bragged that there were more deer and elk in the US now than when the white man came to this land.  I didn't believe him at the time, but now I understand that it could be true - and that it is not necessarily a good thing.  I have been to Zion Canyon and saw stream banks that had exposed earth with trees hanging out over them.  They did show signs of erosion but I thought that was just the way it is supposed to be.  It's not.

What do wolves and mountain lions have to do with stream banks?  A lot.  But there is a story here that goes beyond wolves and mountain lions.  We know that elements of the environment are all connected.  This film shows some of the strands between elements that one would not think of.  We, in our ignorance have tampered with many of the strands.  We in our wisdom can start to repair them.

Everyone should see this film.  Everyone.",1302134400,5,924,4.146892655367232
