8435576,5,B004D0BTAI,"Yoga 4 Kids with Marita Gardner-Anopol---first let me say,the beautiful scenic atmosphere of the DVD was awesome--presented in a way that makes learning something so beneficial for children ,so much fun!!! children are taught not only the physical aspect of yoga poses--but also breathing techniques that relieve anxiety and bring a sense of calmness to them. I especially loved the idea of ""colored breath"" -- the kids pick a color, and  then imagine their breath in that color-to draw attention to their breathing.. I would recommend for home or classroom use.

8435577,5,B004D0BTAI,"Yoga 4 Kids DVD shows beneficial yoga poses and a breathing technique for children in such a fun and nurturing manner. It also introduces evidence based facts of impressive benefits of practicing yoga, like relieving test anxiety and improving test scores tremendously. I like that the kids friendly yoga language, like SURFER POSE, and easy-to-follow instructions are used to intrigue their curiosity and encourage them to want to try the poses. It is great to see the children on the DVD are at different levels so young viewers would not feel like they have to perform the poses perfectly to enjoy yoga. The DVD demonstrates that everyone can do yoga, and that teaching yoga to children will provide them with life-long skills and tools to help them deal with stress effectively and also help children lead a happier and healthier life.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-4-Kids-with-Marita-Gardner-Anopol/dp/B004D0BTAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga 4 Kids with Marita Gardner-Anopol</a>

The Yoga 4 Kids DVD with Marita Gardner-Anopol, is a fun and gentle way to introduce children to a life-long affection for exercise. Both my daughters, ages 10 and 7 loved the concept of the yoga poses associated with nature and animals. The DVD is set in such a beautiful and colorful environment, it is entertaining and motivating to do the yoga practice with Marita & the kids.  The highlight of this DVD is the introduction to meditation for children, practiced in a safe way to calm their bodies and minds.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-4-Kids-with-Marita-Gardner-Anopol/dp/B004D0BTAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga 4 Kids with Marita Gardner-Anopol</a>
