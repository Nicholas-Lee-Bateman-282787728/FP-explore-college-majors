8045106,4,B00076ON8C,The plot is standard but producer manage add twists that makes it worth watching. Hong Kong is pretty setting but politics never touched or mentioned. Main chick pretty but nothing special. We see skin often but lame action is appropriate word. D'Amato didn't catch in all his career what men wanna see in a supposedly erotic movie.,1389830400,2,332,4.842105263157895
8045107,3,B00076ON8C,"This is not really an Emanuelle (or Emmanuelle) story.  Just check out the real title.  Instead we have a Hong Kong doctor who falls in love with and American pilot.  While he is recuperating and under her care, a relationship develops.  But the pilot also develops a relationship with a woman form his airline.  But soon he decides on the doctor and leaves the other with a scorned heart.  Doctor and pilot plan their life together.  They set up a home.  Then he is well-enough to fly and vows to return soon.

But he does not return soon.  His schedule keeps him away and attempts at communication seem to get no answer.  Meanwhile the doctor is trying to contact him but with no results.  Then she hears that he has married an Australian woman.  Despair hits.  She gives up her doctor's position to pursue a career as a courtesan and prostitute.  Finally they run into each other again and unearth the cause of the trouble.  They are back together but the doctor learns of a new shadow of tragedy looming in the near future.

A strange little film.  There is a little Madam Butterfly here but with Madam elevated in status.  Love, loss, sex and tragedy all play their parts in this tragic and sometimes erotic drama.  With its current title you know there is plenty of nudity but the film is too serious to be considered truly erotic.  It is like the Chinese or Zen erotic stories where indulgers always meet tragedy in the end.  A good film for tragedy fans but not for many others.  Check it out.",1168905600,4,1501,4.477777777777778
8045108,3,B00076ON8C,"A Eurotrashy pilot gets in a brawl and is helped by Doctor Emy Wong.  However, the pilot is  more than a little interested in learning more about her bedside manner and begins to develop an aggressive crush on her.  At the same time, Cicciolina plays a woman from his airline offices who develops a relationship with the same pilot and you know there's gonna be trouble there, especially when you find out Cicciolina is going to be intercepting the mail for each of them.  So the pilot gets rid of Cicciolina and goes back to England to get marriage papers for him and Emy.  Emy agrees to wait for him.  However their letters never get to each other because of the office, and Cicci Baby tells Emy that the pilot is marrying someone else.  OK, if you feel like this is your cuppa then go with it, especially since there are some really beautiful lovemaking scenes in this.  All I want to say is this winds up with one of the most oddball deus ux machina in Italo film history (And Brother That's Saying Something!).  Try it out if you want to see what Italian exploitation films are like if you want a change from black gloves and zombie teeth (like we'll ever get enough of those!!!!)",1114560000,12,1185,4.423963133640553
