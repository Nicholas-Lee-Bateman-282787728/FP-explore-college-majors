5528727,5,B00AYVI6SI,This story is the first step of Naruto to become the savior of the ninja world as well as some side stories from Naruto's past.,1366848000,2,127,4.12
5528728,5,B00AYVI6SI,"Warning: though this review does not spoil future events it does reference previous ones, so please do not read if you have not seen boxset 13.

The previous boxset was, in my opinion, the highpoint of Naruto's story so far. Unfortunately, it ended with a shocking cliffhanger as Hinata was ruthlessly cut down by Pain, moments after she declared her love for Naruto. The grief caused by this callous act sees Naruto give in to his rage, and consequently, the Nine Tails Fox. It is here that boxset 14 begins. Contains 13 episodes ( 167 - 179).

The introduction of this boxset is an explosive one, as Naruto (enveloped in the Nine Tails' chakra) unleashes all of his rage at Pain, resulting in a devastating showcase of powers from both men. The battle is nothing short of epic, and the level of strength displayed from both Naruto and Pain is jaw dropping. As is befitting such a seismic battle the animation is superb; resulting in a fluid, free flowing fight which is breathtaking to watch in motion. What's most amazing about this battle, however, is the lengths both Pain and Naruto will go too to win; the jutsus on display eclipse anything seen in Naruto before, they're truly jaw dropping in both scale and ambition.

In this boxset there's little doubt that episodes 167 - 169 are the best ones as they contain unforgettable moments; but then along comes filler.  In this set the filler is distributed seemingly at random, but overall there are six filler episodes in total. What's bizarre about these filler episodes is not just their placement - they come before Pains backstory, and then after the arc ends - but their content that is the problem. For some reason, it was decided that we should go back in time to the good old days when Naruto was 12, the third Hokage was still alive and Sasuke was a confused, but ultimately reliable friend, and join them on a quest to find the 4th Hokage's legacy. On the one hand this represents a chance for fans who have followed the series since the beginning to reminisce and feel nostalgic (these episodes contain the old soundtrack from part 1) on the other hand though, these episodes have absolutely no relevance to the main story arc and are frankly, rubbish. If you haven't seen the old Naruto episodes (1-135)  then I recommend that you do as they're brilliant, but don't waste your time watching these non canon filler ""flashbacks"" of events that never actually happened.

After these two filler specials (they were made to generate interest for Naruto movie 4, starring the 4th Hokage) there is a return to great canon material. The canon episodes that follow wrap up the Pain arc excellently whilst also explaining what drove Pain to become the way he is. After hearing his side of the story one can't help but feel for him and his fellow orphans, and the difficult life they have had. Masashi Kishimoto once again displays that storytelling is one of his greatest strengths, and fans will not be disappointed at how this arc ends.

As ever, the music is great with the standout track Hisou (Tragedy) providing the epic BGM that this series deserves.

Overall, this is a great boxset for fans of Naruto and is highly recommended to all anime fans.",1364515200,17,3212,4.69271758436945
5528729,5,B00AYVI6SI,"The previous box set was great.  Showed some great training and character development.  This box set concludes the battle between Naruto and pain.  Also includes the fourth hokage parts.  This box set is going to one of the best to have in your collection.

But we all know that's not going to stop us from completing our collection!",1363996800,14,430,4.448717948717949
5528730,1,B00AYVI6SI,"Going back through Naruto Part I and earlier Shippuden Boxed sets its hard not to miss the obvious lack of quality in the newer sets.  The older sets contained booklets and nice cover art with care and effort put into them, this set doesnt even have a slip cover.  Its just a standard dvd case with 3 discs crammed inside.  How does this warrant a $45 price tag?  Terrible fail.",1362960000,4,378,4.357142857142857

5528763,5,B00AYVI6SI,"Naruto has always been amoung the best of Japanese anime and Manga.  It gets to the heart of what Manga can do well.  When you first meet little Naruto - he's an orphan, painting graffitti all over his village.  You learn from the village chief (the Hokage) that Naruto does this because the villagers fear him, and show him nothing but contempt.  It is Naruto's way of getting people to notice him.  He vows to one day be the Hokage, and have all the villagers acknowledge him.  Naruto begins his journey in that original series.  The Shippuden Series is that little boy now a young man.  He gains friends and family along the way, things he has constantly yearned for.  He has worked hard at his skills and become a good ninja, but a greater friend and comrade to all whose lives he touches.  Naruto also had a secret, inside of him, he has the captured chakra (spiritual energy) of the nine-tails beast - a wicked and powerful demon that could easily destroy whole cities.  Only Naruto's bright optimism and sense of worth keeps the beast from taking over.  Any Ninja that can see within Naruto and see the beast is amazed at how this boy can remain so happy and hopeful with such a horrible demon raging to get out.

In this set, Naruto is finally recognized for the hero he is to his village.  He is not yet Hokage, but he gains what he truly yearned for, and what his great father wished for him, to be known as a true hero of his village.  I have not given up any details of this set, that's for you to explore, but I hope I have convinced you the trip is worth it.",1376092800,,1572,4.299319727891157
5528764,5,B00AYVI6SI,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

5528783,5,B00AYVI6SI,"Naruto Shippuden Box Set 14 is truly a masterpiece collection of Naruto episodes and an absolute must have for any fan of the show! Before buying the product, I heard people complaining of how this box set has almost as many filler episodes as it does episodes from the main arc. Honestly, I assumed that the fillers were not going to be that great compared what else was on this collection. However, after watching these episodes, I was plesantly surprised with what I thought were going to be useless distraction episodes and found myself enjoying them just as much as the main arc. That is to say they are definetly not as good as the main arc episodes, but to those who may be skeptical about getting it for that reason, do NOT let them defer you from buying it. As for the main arc episodes, all of them are not only visually stunning but masterfully crafted, and wonderfully acted, to the point that, I would say, they are some of the best episodes in the show's history, especially episodes 167. It has the effects and animation that make it truly one of the stand out episodes in the Naruto Shippuden catalog and one I could watch over and over without tiring of it. All in all, on a scale of 1-10, I would give this box set a 9 to 9 1/2 making it something that every fan of the show, those just getting curious about it and those who just want episodes from a great animated series, should have in there collection!",1367020800,5,1425,4.401515151515151
