4662579,4,B005DVIPE4,"As most Naruto fans can attest, the release of this movie (in America) was highly anticipated for a good year and a half. I guess thats with any popular Anime movie that we wait to get subbed into English, but this was even more anticipated because of raised expectations from the Shippuuden world. But the question remains, does the second Shippuuden movie live up to the high standard set by the series? Eh, sorta.

""Bonds"" follows a pretty formulaic plot, as far as Naruto movies go. Something goes wrong, Naruto is sent on a mission with Sakura and whoever else is picked to have screen time this time around (Hinata being the third team member in this case), an important secondary character is introduced (the spunky tomboy Amaru), bad stuff happens in between, fighting, the bad guy is revealed, fighting, Naruto gets his butt kicked, passionate speech, epic final battle, the end. Now of course the movie is more complex then this, but this is merely the outline of the plot that most of these Naruto movies follow, and to be honest, thats fine with me. It works. One shouldn't go into these movies expecting to see some huge incredible story unfold. Its fan service, and fans love seeing these ninjas do what they do best: fight.

The movie was by no means bad, but as is with many movies, it didn't live up to the hype that was provided by the preview. I think the reason this was as much of a disappointment as it was is because the biggest thing fans looked forward to when watching this was seeing Sauske in action with Naruto. Anyone who has followed the series knows that Sauske has been absent for a very long time, and has only recently been getting any airtime. About the time this movie came out, we were starving for a little Sauske action, and we expected to see it in ""Bonds"". Well, we weren't totally disappointed, Sauske definitely was in it, and he did his thing, but he's in the movie for all of 10 minutes total. He appears ominously at the beginning, briefly in the middle, and in the epic final battle. Other then that, no Sauske. Its kind of a big jip, but what can you do?

There is one aspect to this movie that has a light and dark side to it. Its a big part of the movie so I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it, but basically the writers decided to incorporate something that was had the potential to be a VERY interesting story in itself, outside of the movie format. The plus is that it does in fact give some depth to the movie and makes it more then just a huge ninja fight fest. The downside however, is that using it in this movie eliminates the possibility of using it in the series for future story development, and I would really love to see that flushed out more. When you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about immediately.

There is plenty of action, so no worries there, and all of your favorite Konoha characters are around for the fun, but its nothing you haven't seen before. The Sky ninja thing is kinda interesting for all of a few minutes, but they wear out their welcome in the opening sequence of the movie in the long, drawn out attack on Konoha (it took almost 10 minutes for them to do!)

Anyway, bottom line, this is a pretty decent movie with moderate replay value. At the very least you will be entertained, because aside from the action, there is plenty of goofy Naruto goodness to get you laughing, enough action to keep you a little hyped, and enough twists, turns, and depth that the story will keep you from falling asleep in the slow moments. Despite it's shortcomings, I like it. 4/5 stars.",1253491200,33,3582,4.437689969604863

As soon as I got it in the mail, I popped it in my dvd to see if it works (since I waited 3 weeks for it due to a mishap) and it does works! The movie itself was okay. I wish their would had been more scenes with Kakashi in it, but, oh well.

Sasuke fought along beside Naruto at the very end of the movie about and it was like, 10 or less than minutes? If you are hoping to see a good fight or something, the episodes were better. But it is still a good movie and for $10, worth it.",1444953600,,610,3.765625

4662619,2,B005DVIPE4,"Well, I just watched the first Naruto Shippuden movie a little while ago. I found it to be heavily clichd, even within the context of the series own universe, and pretty underwhelming. So I figured Id go for a two-fer and check out the next Naruto movie to see if they learned some lessons and did any better. In sum, they did not. In many ways, Naruto Shippuden the Movie 2: Bonds is actually worse than its predecessor, with plot points that make no sense, are pitifully underused or unseen, or both, misleading character building, and again too many clichs. Like many of the other Naruto movies, they're not flat-out terrible, and are still mostly watchable if you are a fan of the series and know what you're going to get from it going in.
 The film opens with Konoha, the Village Hidden in the Leaves, under attack. Again. This must be like the eighth time in the series. Konoha is more prone to blowing up than Tokyo, New York City, and Metropolis combined. Id hate to see their homeowners insurance premiums. At any rate, they are under attack from the Sora ninjas from the Land of Sky. Kind of oxymoronic, isn't it? Its like the Light of Darkness or the Flame of Aqua. Theyre out for revenge on the Leaf for being decimated decades before. Chalk it up to another passing allusion to a supposedly significant event in this worlds mythos that should have massive international and historical implications but is instead never mentioned before or since. It happens. These ninjas have chakra-powered jetpacks, kunai-firing machine guns, and are based on Battleships in the harbor. Nothing about them is consistent with this series world; they seem like they came from another franchise and just invaded this one. Naruto and friends are tasked with defeating them, meet some more expendable one-shot characters along the way, team-up with former ally Sasuke Uchiha, and stop the evil thing from doing the evil thing. In short, this film just seems phoned-in. Nothing seems original, the story (and even the show itself) have done this before, nothing of any significance or substance happens, and the film itself doesnt deliver on its own advertising.
 Narutos one-time friend of the day is Amaru, and apprentice to a doctor from another land. Shes another girl-mistaken-for-a-boy character that anime in general and even this series has seen way too many of. I will give the character design a little credit though. Her design does slightly change when her true gender is revealed, becoming more feminine and softer; it reminded me a little of Mulans design. The doctor shes a companion for is not that much of an original character either. Needless to say, his arc will not surprise you, but the lack of logic and reason for his motivations definitely will.
 Theres another mysterious dark entity called the Zero Tails. Im still not sure what it is or where it came from. It doesnt really fit into the mythos of the rest of the monsters of the series lore. I think it is supposed to be the manifestation of despairing thoughts of people, and apparently feeling bad enough can summon it and possess you. Why would something so easy to summon never have been mentioned before and never mentioned since? Bad writing. Believe it. The villain also has an evil Death Star ship (seriously, it even fires a giant laser beam) that the heroes must destroy. The climax is long and confusing, and doesnt really pay off the build-up from the rest of the film.
The key selling point in this film is the reunion of Naruto and Sasuke, who have to team-up again to stop the bad guy. Problem is, Sasuke is barely in it. Except for a very brief expository scene (which doesnt give much a good reason for his inclusion in the story to begin with), Sasuke doesnt show up until the last twenty minutes or so. I do like the fact that Hinata, one of my personal favorite characters from the series, is included in the story. Unfortunately, she and Naruto don't interact much, she doesnt contribute anything important, and she even flat-out disappears during the third act.
The film does have a few good points. Some of the fight scenes are pretty impressive, particularly the old-fashioned melee ones. You do feel for Amarus predicament, and you do end up hating the villain characters more than the bad writing, which is usually a sign of something decent. Other than that very little silver lining, this is mostly a dark dreary cloud of a movie. Honestly, it can be skipped without missing anything. There are better Naruto movies down the road.",1431302400,,4528,4.758269720101781

4662670,3,B005DVIPE4,"Pretty much the problem with this movie is that the plotline and excution is falling into DBZ film territory (ends at random and are very repetitive of each other), which is just not good. It seems ridicoulous for an entire army of sky ninja to be allowed to bomb the leaf village while nobody does much of anything, but it happens. Shouldn't there have been at least something resembling a war at home while Naruto and co. discovered the true issue here?

But when they do, we are hit by an entirely new problem. We have a moving fortress with immense power feeding off of people. We have the person who thought they were being mentored by the best, only to be betrayed by a truly evil being. We have fighting inside and it crashing down. Sound familar? Yeah, basically all hits on plot points from the second Naruto movie.

I know these movies are all filler and formulatic, but this one just went too far. Now the last 30 minutes does put up quite a crazy hit with a worm-like tail beast, with Naruto and Sasuke having to work together to destroy the monstrous creature. This scene is quite good, and the humorous ending after a dramatic falling from the sky to their death sequence was well done. However, the entire middle of this movie was quite dissapointing, and the fight scenes themselves aside from the Naruto/Sasuke team up were weak. And again, the entire rest of the sky ninja bomb, and then basically do nothing for the rest of the movie, their constructions destroyed by some odd amount of bugs that could've never existed. I quess they figured the Sasuke/Naruto sequence was enough to bring people in, and to be honest, it worked.

However, it cannot even come close to comparing to Naruto Movie 2: Legend Of The Stone Of Gelel, or Naruto Shippuden: The Movie. I honestly don't think it's close to any of them really.",1341792000,2,1834,4.5683890577507595

Cons: Overall plot, poor character development, lack of series tie in, lack of making sense?, repeated dialogue, weak fight scenes, few fight scenes, small scope

This review does contain minor spoilers, please do not read further if this bothers you. By far the worst fight scenes I have yet to witness in the Naruto series or movies I have watched to date. Which doesn't say much as there were only a handful of fight moments. The plot was extremely weak, and in many ways did not follow true to the Naruto I know. The leaf village bombed into ruins in the first few minutes by flying ninjas that were seen by everyone coming towards the village, yet there was no defense raised to speak of. It was truly pathetic to see some of the strongest Ninja's in the story stand there and go o no people are flying above us and I have suddenly forgotten the literally hundreds of abilities I know that can deal with that. No one has ever heard of these attacking ninja, then suddenly they have, ""O it's those guys from x years ago we fought that I momentarily forgot about and have never mentioned but we all know that."" This same Ninja attack force that just bombed the leaf village are then taken out by 1 ninja, who is not even what I would call a main character.

I've seen this movie. It is not as good as the first one. However, it is better than the other Naruto movies. It is one of the better ones in terms of story and drawing.",1319068800,,418,4.097560975609756
4662723,4,B005DVIPE4,"Like I said, it's not bad. You've got a number of your typical anime movie spinoff tropes going on here. Forced & cliched Love Interest plot, mysterious new bad guys shoved into the lore sideways, prickish underdeveloped villain, etc. All non-canon of course, like all the Naruto movies. It's certainly nothing I'd praise as being inspired or original, but it's an entertaining watch and the soundtrack is catchy.

So, here's the plot. The Sky Country, crushed long ago by Konoha and the other ninja villages, is back for revenge. Konoha is under siege. So our hero Naruto... is sent on a bodyguard assignment that is potentially unrelated to this sudden aerial attack. The only purpose this attack serves is to announce the presence of our villains, they don't regroup and attack again or anything intelligent like that. So Naruto goes on his mission with Sakura and Hinata. If that wasn't meant to be the sign that the supporting cast will be useless in all things plot related, I don't know why they were chosen.

The highpoints are definitely the middle of the movie, featuring a rare movie appearance of the Demon-Fox mode Naruto in a monster-mash against the Reibi (Zero Tails) non-canon Tailed-Beast type monster. Whose rebirth is apparently the villain's goal now? It feeds on negative emotions like hate and despair. That's another one for the cliche bin, by the way. Followed shortly by the underdeveloped villain and Naruto having an ideological confrontation which... honestly, is one of the more touching moments of the movie. Maybe it's just the music being superbly well done, but this particular clash really stands out in memory. It skirts the line of melodrama and fell on the side of heartfelt rather than cheesy for me, which is rare.

So... Sasuke arrives around this point, and his ""making it up as I go"" powers are in full effect (I don't like the character, as you may have guessed). It's worth noting that, when this movie was released in Japan, Sasuke was still a fairly sympathetic character, but has recently made all new attempts at crossing the Moral Event Horizon again. They work together to bring down the Reibi in the most cliche, unsatisfying way they can come up with. And make no efforts whatsoever to resolve their complicated relationship because, of course, NON-CANON MOVIE.

I don't really consider ""the good guys win, no canon characters were harmed in this film"" revelations to be SPOILERS because, well, never happens in your basic anime series spinoff non-canon movie. Suffice to say I kept a few potential spoilers out of my review to preserve your amusement at certain moments. Can't comment on the English dub because I haven't heard it, but I can assure you Naruto's VA is annoying in every language.

Overall I recommend watching this. Sure it's cliche, but its mostly done well. Aside from the final boss fight. Worth a rent at least, and it'll be available from Netflix October 25. I'm going to buy it, the parts I like are worth it. Which is more than I can say for the other two Shippuden movies yet unreleased outside of Japan.",1317686400,3,3082,4.840607210626186
4662724,4,B005DVIPE4,"Although arguably formulaic like the previous movies, Bonds is still just different enough to stick out in my mind; the drama and action are nicely balanced, particularly considering that there are two equally important stories being followed. As the case art indicates, Sasuke does have a notable role in the film, and though I'm far from a Sasuke fan, his presence wasn't so involved and grating that I disliked the sequences that centered around him; toward the end of the movie, in fact, I quite enjoyed his part in the events. Even if you've been less than impressed by the previous movies, I'd recommend seeing this one. It's the first time Sasuke's appeared in a movie since Clash in the Land of Snow, and I'd say he definitely makes up for the lost time.",1316044800,10,762,4.6940298507462686

4662726,5,B005DVIPE4,"This Movie begins on a high note with the Hidden Leaf village being attacked by the ""Sky Country"". In this attack the Leaf is almost destroyed. This movie is a little different from other Naruto movies because it has two stories going on at once. Everything is revealed when the stories finally meet with each other. The fight scenes are amazing and very well animated, the story is gripping, and there are a lot of fan fights in this one. Sasuke shows up and Naruto fights along side him for a while in this one. All and all, I would recommend this series and all of it's movies (minus Naruto Shippuden movie 4: the lost tower) to anyone and everyone that asked me. This is definitely a good buy even if it is a random one. I hope that helps your decision.",1314403200,27,757,4.338028169014085
4662727,5,B005DVIPE4,I am addicted to Japanese Anime and have been since 1969. Naruto is my all time favorite series. I had a hunch that it was a read along but would have been great to have known it when I first looked at it at Amazon. A great movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I will purchase the English version when it becomes available.,1310083200,,316,3.953125

8467663,5,B005DVIPE4,Naruto never is a dull moment. This in one of my favorite anime characters and I have been trying to collect all of the movies now that the manga is over. You can always find some part of yourself in these anime characters. It can be sad as hell or funny as hell in a split moment like I said never a dull moment in the Land of the Leaf!!!!,1501286400,,340,3.8714285714285714

8467668,3,B005DVIPE4,The only thing I have to say about my package is that when I went to open I heard the dvd sliding around inside the case. I thought I was hearing things until I took the plastic off and opened the case and the dvd fell out. I looked at the back of it and it had scuff marks on it. Hopefully it still plays. I'm still happy that I purchased it before they sold out ,1481846400,,364,3.789473684210526
