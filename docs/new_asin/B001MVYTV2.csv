8322115,1,B001MVYTV2,"Despite the DVD jacket indicating that this movie was made in 2007 movie it was probably made in the 1970's as it favours the Communist propaganda take on that period of Poland's history.  No mention is made about Pilsudski's defeat of the Soviet invading army in 1920. Essentially, I was most disappointed.

Also, the transition to digital format was very poor.  I suspect the image and sound were transferred from a poor VHS tape.",1479081600,3,432,4.8108108108108105
8322116,5,B001MVYTV2,"Good adaption of historical events, unvarnished truth always hurts. Acting is high quality. Dvd is an historical study of events, a serious movie and not light entertainment. I wish that more films could be released on Poland of that era...I know that Polish film produced a lot of WW2 films of great interest.",1363996800,5,310,4.867924528301887
8322117,4,B001MVYTV2,"An excellent photographic achievement, it presents an outstanding actor in the role of Marshal J. Pilsudski. But the aim of the film is less clear. Was it to undermine the liberator's reputation who led his legion victoriously against the Soviet Union in 1920, or merely an attempt to reveal the hidden weaknesses of the then democratic government? Many felt for years that Pilsudski would have prevented the German invasion of Poland in 1939, listening to his own wisdom instead of that of the phoney supporters to the west of Germany.

I recommend the film to the fullest extent.",1314057600,8,581,4.928571428571429
