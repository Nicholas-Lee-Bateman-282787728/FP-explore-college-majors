1079519,5,6305812926,"This is the most recent release in the Trigun series.  This review is more for the whole series than just this specific DVD.  Trigun is incredible.  It chronicles the life of Vash, the main character.  Such a rich, involved, beautiful story!!!  Vash is an ideal hero with a complex past and future.  I recommend this to everyone!  One of the best stories ever.",987984000,,360,4.619047619047619
1079520,4,6305812926,"Of course it is all relative.  A mediocre Trigun episode is so much better than anything else.
Vash gets back into the Gungho-Gun-fighting groove in this volume.  The first two episodes are linked together (much like the B.D. Neon episodes).  The fights are...decent.  Not much humor.  The villains are kind of...'meh'.
It seems suprising that there is only one volume left in the series.  Hopefully many of the loose ends will get tied up.",987897600,,440,4.878378378378378
1079521,5,6305812926,"This will be the 7th volume of Trigun leaving only 1 volume (4 episodes) left with this series.  This DVD was really good, new plot points and you learn new things about some charactesr.  But it didn't feel like this series would end anytime soon at the end of the last episode.  So with that, it will be interesting to see how the series will end.  Maybe it will leave it open for another series.
The video quality is like the previous volumes.  The transfer looks nice, sometimes little parts annoy me.  The audio is well done.  I listened to the English dub, haven't heard the japanese track yet.  I am sure both of them are really nice.  The dub for Trigun is amazing in my opinion.  I really respect this dub because the voices match the characters very well and that doesn't happen much in many English dubs.
The three episodes are obviously involving, 'The Puppet Master,' one of the Gung-ho Guns led by Legato.  You learn some more about the evil people and their evil deeds (a lot of evil deeds in this DVD).  You learn some more about Vash's past.  Vash gets accompanied by Wolfwood and ditched Meryl and Milly.  But they eventually find him as always.  More humor, more drama, more action!
Final Note:  The DVD menu for this volume was simply amazing!  It has the same interface as the other past ones but the nice music accompanying the nice background was amazing.  The menu is a photo album that opens up and flips through a few pages to get to the other pages.  It just looks really nice and works really well with the subtle BGM.",986860800,4,1545,4.434163701067615
1079522,4,6305812926,"If you have gotten this far you obviously like the series. This is by far the most depressing set of episodes in the series so far, but gives you enough to want the rest (2 more months until the next one =(..). If you haven't gotten this far, you should, Trigun is a great series. Despite the group of sad episodes, I still say you should get this one to complete your set.",985737600,,373,4.123287671232877
1079523,3,6305812926,I'm a huge Trigun fan but I must admit that this volume was pretty weak.  These three episodes were extremely formulaic and cliche.  The whole DVD just seemed taped together as filler.  Very dissapointing.  I still recommend the series in general but I think that this volume could be skipped.  It would all be worthwhile if Vash did something cool like usual but he doesn't do a single thing noteworthy.  No cool bullet dodging.  No cool gunplay we haven't seen before.  Not even a cool song about total slaughter.  Very sad.,985737600,,526,4.6923076923076925
1079524,5,6305812926,"What a great Anime series! I simply love the Trigun series and it gets better and better with every new volume. Puppet Master is one of my favourites. It gives us more insight about the Planet, Vash and of course, Wolfwood. I love these two characters and I hate to say this, but I usually cheer on the bad guys b/c I always find them to be much cooler. However not in this series, Vash and Wolfwood are wonderful character creations. I highly recommend this DVD for everyone simply because Trigun offers beautiful visuals, real character development and an exciting and suspenseful storyline.",985737600,2,593,4.766990291262136
1079525,5,6305812926,Awesome DVD - if your into Anime then this is a must buy.  I highly recommend this DVD.  This Anime has a great mix of action and comedy.  The characters are great and leave you wanting more every episode.,982540800,3,205,4.205128205128205

7895515,5,6305812926,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,554,4.276190476190476
7895516,5,6305812926,This is a hilarious anime and my god at first I could not stop laughing. Vash and Wolfwood are a great couple. (in a non sexual way) With out those two the series would lose some of its humor and overall plot.,1204934400,,209,4.0
7895517,5,6305812926,"In this collection, the plot begins to pick up speed.  Having again to decided to bear the burden of being Vash the Stampede, Vash decides to return home.  Home, in this case, is a floating sky city - the last operating spaceship in the fleet that brought Knives and Vash to this planet.  The denizens of that ship live in their own isolated society.  Accompanied by Wolfwood, Vash pays his first visit home in many years.  Unknown to him, however, Legato Bluesummers has dispatched three Gung-Ho Guns to the sky city.
With a plot like this, the ""Trigun"" fan can expect lots of over-the-top action and gunfights.  This two-parter doesn't disappoint.  Wolfwood begins using his cross as, alternately, a machine gun and rocket launcher. Vash enagages in a number of nifty fight sequences without fatally injuring anyone.  What makes these two episodes work, however, is the wrting.  The script draws out the emotions behind the characters.  There's a lot of suspense and terror behind the Gung-Go Guns slaughter.  And the ending is very sad.  Impessively so, since the involved characters were only introduced for these two episodes.
Episode 22, ""Alternatives"", has one of the dumber ""Trigun"" plots.  More mindless hysteria at the mere mention of Vash' name, coupled with giant worms.  But, watching it for a second time, I remembered why this series works.  Characterization.  This episode further defines the principals.  Milly's soft-heart, Vash's let-live-at-all-costs philosoph, Wolfwood's weary cyncicism; these viewpoints play nicely off each other.  And the ending is pivotal, one of the turning points in ""Trigun.""
All in all, an excellent run of episodes.  Maybe not a five-star classic, but definitely worthy of 4 1/2 stars.",1056931200,,1733,5.169064748201439

7895519,5,6305812926,"I've never read the manga, but these sure make me want to go out & buy the whole lot.
It's kinda like Outlaw Star meets Cowboy Bebop. It's absolutely hilarious & even modest adults can't escape the spell it puts on you. My only regret id that the last few episodes dramatically switched from humor to seriousness, just like Ruroni Kenshin.",1011744000,,339,4.573770491803279
7895520,5,6305812926,"Well, sadly Trigun's almost over. After this volume is the final one with the remaining four episodes, which make this volume look like nothing. But this volume is full of great scenes and drama. It's not as *funny* (although Vash manages to get a few scenes in) as the previous volumes, almost the polar opposite of volume one. The transition started at episode 12, ""Diablo"" from comedy to drama is complete and everything's spiraling down...
This volume contains three episodes, ""Flying Ship"", ""Out of Time"" and the aptly titled ""Alternative"". Wolfwood follows Vash to a Project SEEDS ship that failed to crash. Of course, the Gung-Ho-Guns follow as well; heartbreak ensues. Meryl and Milly play a much bigger part in the third episode. In ""Alternative"", the four befriend a group of orphan children living in the desert. But things aren't always what they seem. The volume ends with a moral argument of Vash's idealism versus realism. Wolfwood hits rock bottom mentally.
The character interaction is what sets this series apart from others, and is really the focus of this volume.

7895523,5,6305812926,"After ""Project Seeds,"" I was kind of worried that the series was losing its momentum. ""Puppet Masters"" proved me gratifyingly wrong. In the first two episodes, we get to meet some of Vash's near-family; a city of colonists that survived in part of the original ship, flying above the planet's surface. Trouble quickly follows him in the form of three more of the Gung-ho Guns, that break into the ship, kill Vash's friends, and crash the city... and at long last, the mystery of what in heck IS Vash anyway is finally solved... sort of. In the final episode on this tape, Vash and his gang return to something of their normal pattern of cruising around the planet looking for wrongs to fight... but some doubts are cast on Wolfwood's allegience.
If you're a Trigun fan, this tape is a must-have. If you're an Anime fan but not a Trigun fan, then you should be; go back and buy ""The $$60,000,000,000 Man.""",988848000,,904,4.58641975308642
