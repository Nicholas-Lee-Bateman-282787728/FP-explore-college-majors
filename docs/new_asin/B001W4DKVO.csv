The film represents a man struggling with his past, allowing himself to be victimized by his tragic loss and how a beautiful tantalizing Muse finally awakens him to regain his creativity. The director uses simple but powerful symbolism to illustrate tragedy, loss of self, resignation, rebirth and inspiring love. Watching and feeling Lynette Walden sensuously create her character with limited dialogue is worth twice the price of admission. To me it is an ode to the mesmerizing power of women......Yessssss!",1412208000,,530,5.385542168674699
3823947,5,B001W4DKVO,"I was an extra in this movie, I'm glad to have found it there are not a lot of copies around. I'm in the first 5 minutes, my kids were excited to see it. It's a good story, about a guy who looses his wife. He won't  play his music any more.",1389657600,,240,3.6153846153846154
3823948,5,B001W4DKVO,"Long story short Morris is a sax player whose wife dies and he loses all motivation to play.  Scraping by writing and performing commercial ""jingles"" one fateful night he meets a young lady named Jasmine.  Something about her reignites a passion to play.  However, will his painful extinguish his newfound passion?

I think I first watched this movie while a teenager working at a video store.  I remember it being a great make out movie as there was always jazz playing in the background.  When I went to college and was a brooding sort I enjoyed Morris's (Michael Madsen) self-pitying character.

Whenever I dated someone new this movie was always one of the first that I popped in.  It is about the only reason I keep a VHS player around.  It was even one of the first movies I made my wife watch when we were first dating!

I love the first playful interactions between Morris and Jasmine (Lynette Walden).  I think Lynette Walden is extremely sexy in this movie.  Their dialogue is playful and fun; as about as much fun as you can imagine Michael Madsen being...  a good flirt his character is not.

For those guys (i.e. most if not all) that had one get away this is a good movie.  If you aren't sure if she can ever be replaced and you are worried about disappointment...  Well, boys, she ain't coming back!  But don't worry, as it turns out there maybe be something different, and just as good, coming around the corner!",1201046400,,1428,4.537254901960784
8346937,2,B001W4DKVO,"Not much of a story. Poor acting, especially by Jasmine. She is always wandering around, waving her arms, I guess because she's supposed to be a dancer, but it's distracting. The character of her pregnant friend with a gun is not convincing.",1503532800,,241,4.761904761904762

8346944,5,B001W4DKVO,"This is an older movie that stars Michael Madsen when he was younger. It was a bit of a low budget film, but I have to admit that I really liked it. Michael is not a bad guy in this movie. It showed a different side of his acting ability. The jazz music in it is really cool, if you like jazz at all. The acting throughout the movie may not have been A+ every scene, but the movie did offer a wide range of characters which was really cool. I enjoy seeing Michael in almost every movie of his I have watched. If every movie was perfectly made, it would be so boring and unrealistic. I found this movie very interesting even with its ""quirky"" bits. I've watch it many times on Amazon Prime, and I'm happy to have the DVD as part of my collection. If in the US, you have to be very careful when you buy it because of the regional differences in DVD's.",1443225600,,849,4.059523809523809

8346946,5,B001W4DKVO,"I really enjoyed this movie. This movie was one of the earlier ones for Michael Madsen. Michael didn't play a bad guy in this movie, much to the disappointment of many. However, he did play a guy with a caring heart. This movie was a bit cheesy, but it was a cheese that I enjoyed. It was a bit slow at times, but life is slow at times. Michael's larger than life ""manager"" in the movie brought an interesting form of humor to the flick. I've watched this movie more than once, and enjoyed it each time.",1440028800,,503,4.195876288659794
