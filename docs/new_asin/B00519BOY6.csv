4520881,4,B00519BOY6,"""Even if we were to call someone, what would we say"".  Five college friends decide to celebrate a friends 21st birthday at her aunt and uncle's house in the country. On the way there they are tormented by a man in a van, they finally reach thier destination think they are in for a relaxing weekend.  In the last ten years there have basically been two types of horror movies.  The ""Saw"" type, and the ""Reality"" (Paranormal Activity & Blair Witch like) type.  This falls into the reality style, but it is actually pretty good.  When I watched ""The Blair With Project"" the first time I thought it was a pretty neat idea, but very, very boring with a stupid ending.  To me this is the type of movie that ""Blair Witch"" wanted to be.  The movie seems very much the same, no script, just a basic idea of what they wanted and everything creepy happens off camera so you just get a sense of what is going on, which adds to the effect.  I am not saying this is a hide under the bed scary, but it does have it's creepy moments.  Most of the horror is in the waiting for something to happen, much like in ""Paranormal Activity 2"".  One bad thing I will say about the movie is that it should have ended 20 min before it did.  I guess the director wanted people to stay through the credits so it added more clips, but that's what DVD special features are for.  Overall, very surprisingly good inde-horror that is much better then ""Blair Witch"".  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would, this is the kind of movie that loses it's edge with repeated viewings.

Also try - Paranormal Activity 1 & 2 & The Blair Witch Project",1310428800,2,1629,4.2435064935064934
4520882,4,B00519BOY6,"After taking a trip to a remote location, five friends disappear without a trace. No evidence has ever been found as to what happened to them until now. A mysterious tape has been dicovered and it will reveal the horror that they went through, and hopefully open the door to answering what happened.

Evil Things begins a bit like Cloverfield. You are presented with a single frame showing that what you are about to watch is an FBI evidence tape anonymously sent by mail. From there, the movie begins and we bear witness to what this tape holds and the horrors within. Five friends, Cassy (Laurel Casillo), Mark (Morgan Hooper), Tanya (Torrey Weiss), Leo (Ryan Maslyn whom we rarely see because he is the camera man) and Miriam (Elyssa Mersdorf) travel from New York to Miriam's Aunt Gail's (Gail Cadden) country home for a fun weekend.

On the way, they encounter a little road rage and a couple scares before reaching their destination. Once they arrive, they can begin Miriam's 21st birthday party. But all is not well. As the weekend unfolds, so does the horror that awaits them. What happens next is beyond terrifying.

The movie can be compared to Quarantine and Paranormal Activity, and in my book, I found this to be better than Paranormal Activity. With Paranormal Activity, I found myself wondering when it was all going to end; With Evil Things, I wanted more. It's a ride through terror that starts strong and well paced, but about 20 minutes in, it slows, and then takes a decent amount of time for the story to ramp up and get going again.

A bit of the mingling and dialogue between the characters could have been substituted with a few more frightening moments. At times during the slow moments it feels as if everything is alright, made apparent as the characters enjoy their party, even after a spooky moment. Over all, everything works out well in the end as we are catapulted into a finale that even caught me by surprise.

Evil Things marks the debut of director Dominic Perez who shows he already has a solid grasp on the concept of a good horror film. Some may say a few of the thrills and chills in this movie are a bit clich, but what horror movie isn't? Perez doesn't go for gimmicky scares or special effects but rather he has gone for grasping your mind firmly and twisting your psyche. He works to trigger your fears and freak you out. He does so very well and sparks some intense moments throughout the film that almost have you looking over your shoulder.

They aren't doing anything except to annoy the heck out of me, especially the dumb girls who do nothing but scream at things and do nothing else.

After seeing it though,I can't imagine why it got such low or mixed ratings. As far as a found footage film,it was really done quite well. The acting wasn't bad,and the storyline kept moving. Unlike many found footage movies,this wasn't some unrealistic ghost investigation,or  a bunch of kids going into the woods to hunt some creature; this situation was quite plausible. The monster(s) in this film were flesh and blood. As a big fan of the found footage genre,I would rate this amongst the better films in its class.

Characters convey a realistic naturalism often lacking in these film's. I felt very familiar with and easily attached to these characters who exemplify the innocent and fun days of freshly turning 21. An appropriate introduction to our ""villain"" paves way for the deceptively ""fun"" and innocent middle  before ramping up for the conclusion. Watching this alone and in a pitch dark basement was honestly and without hyperbole the most disturbing and psychologically unsettling film experience of my life. A villain with no motive or form is frankly terrifying to the imagination. The seemingly natural realism of the characters (who all seemed oddly to look/behave like friends of my own 21 days), combined with the first person voyeurism elements of found footage makes for an experience that is terrifying to contemplate on both fields of POV. It is mentally numbing to conceive of being in said situation or of initiating said situation.

The pointless meandering story that had nothing to do with anything? Or any of the other giant massive flaws in the movie? No. It was the fact that they got lost in the woods. In the snow.

4520968,2,B00519BOY6,"Although I agree with a lot of what the one-star reviews say, I did find the drive up to the house creepy, and that is the only reason why I continued to watch the movie.  Actually, that and I was feeling under the weather that day.  Anyway, it was a little reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"".  The mood was set for me to be spooked out.  But once they got to the house, it just melds into one of the most tedious movies.  I could tell the actors were improvising their dialogue (and badly).  Director says ""OK you're having a good time in this scene,"" and then ""OK, you're lost in the woods, and you're annoyed about that so you lash out at everybody.  Action!""  The whiney actors really got in the way.  Also.....NOTHING HAPPENS between the time they arrive at the house and the end.  It's all just really boring filler till we get to the reveal.  But once I got to that point, the spook factor had long since faded and I just wanted to know how they were going to end it.  It wasn't worth the wait.

Maybe you have to be in the right mood to be frightened by it?
Honestly I was so bored I was glad when the unknown bad guy started offing the cast.

The characters aren't likable.  The attempted story has been done to death.  Nothing new to see here.  You feel no empathy or connection to the actors so when bad things start to go down there's a sense of relief because you know the film is probably almost over.

4521062,2,B00519BOY6,"First of all, I have to say that I personally enjoyed most of the film.  However, I cant recommend this film to most people.  I enjoyed it because it was ""free"", included as an Amazon Prime Free Streaming video.

This film tells the story of a group of 5 twenty-something friends that go away for a weekend to celebrate one of the friends 21st birthday.  They leave NYC and take a road trip to the winter home of the birthday girl's aunt.  An unseen ""guy in a van"" starts messing with them, tailing them, following them, beeping at them, that sort of thing, and everyone automatically freaks out dramatically.  The guy in the van leaves them alone eventually, and they continue on their way.  Of course, creepy things start to happen in the usual horror film fashion.

I cannot recommend this film.  It is a slow build, a very, very slow build, and most of the film is an attempt at tension, atmosphere and setup.  I actually really enjoy atmosphere, tension and all that spookiness, so I didn't mind this. However, there just wasn't any payoff for the tense scenes. There is a lot of teasing with no reward given.  There are not even a lot of good jump scares, the signature funhouse move of all horror films.  The end of the film, though finally delivering on action, was just a shaky, disorienting mess. I felt like the film makers were taking advantage of the found footage genre as a cover for a complete lack of planning.  I felt like they said, Ok, theres not really a script for this part, and the budget is completely flat, sooo just start running, screaming bloody murder and PLEASE shake and twirl the camera around as much as possible.  That should do it.

The characters also spook and panic waay more easily than is actually believable.  Things that in normal, fully functional adults would trigger simple annoyance or curiosity result in outright panic and freaking out for no real reason.  I mean, these are young adults from the one of the largest metropolises in the world, right?  They've seen it all...and yet they're basically afraid of their own shadow??  I've been to NYC about 5 or 6 times, and it's chock-full of angry, aggressive vans, usually white and often windowless.  A more believable reaction from world-wise urban kids would be to arrogantly flick off ""van guy"" and joke about it...at least at first, anyway.

So why did I enjoy this film?  Number one, I enjoy horror films and have an open mind for different levels of budget and amateur skill.  Though this one fell short of its aim, I enjoyed the journey.  The actors did a good job with sometimes unrealistic dialogue and character actions, especially Laurel Casillo (Cassy). The first act or two showed possibility, and then it went downhill from there.  Secondly, the plot hit a personal  happy nerve with me!  Once or twice every winter, I and - yep - four friends pile into a truck - two in the front, three in the back -  and drive north for several hours to a friends family winter home for a long weekend of skiing, laying around and LOTS of drinking.  Once we leave the highway, the roads get snowy, rural and twisty.  When we get there, the house is dark and freezing, we have to find the key, turn on the heat, and then we light a fire, sit around and start drinking.  HA!  The kids in the film could be us minus the whole psycho killer/boogeyman thing.  I would like us to watch it on the next trip, but since I apparently am the only one who can find enjoyment in bad scary movies, I would be the only one liking it!

So I enjoyed this, but it's not a well-made film, and I feel like I may be one of the very few who doesn't think it's a total waste.  It needs much more action and it just really comes off the rails in the last act.  I want to personally give it 3 stars, but I don't want anyone who reads my 3-star review to think that it's ok to pay for.  It's just...not.

The drive is making one girl sick, crying ensues.  There is a van following them, bickering/complaining ensues.  Someone is knocking at the door (their aunt by the way), they argue over whether or not to answer the door.  Lost in the woods, crying, complaining, and bickering ensues.  I felt like these people were going through teenage angst, not a horror movie.  By the time the scares start, I was cheering for them to die so I wouldn't have to listen to them anymore.  So much time is spent on the crying and bickering, the actual horror part is only like the last 15 minutes of the movie.",1453507200,4,764,4.518248175182482

This one has five young people ( of course, one has a camera) setting out on a road trip for a weekend getaway and to celibrate a birthday. In the first 51 minutes we have some incidents on the road and the usual bickering, knee jerk reactions and stop playing with the camera boring dialogue and not much else.
They tried and failed to effectively use the unseen presence to inject fear into story and instead we were left with five annoying people in the woods saying and doing the dumbest things.
When things start to heat up when the group returns to the house and finds a *$%# on the porch, the group falls back to doing what they do best. They say and do the dumbest things
We don't know what happens to them, because the director wants us to fear the unknown and leaves everything up to our imagination. It doesn't take a whole lot of thought processing to figure out the who did it, but we aren't given a clue as to the why?
Finally, it takes 9 minutes to end this slow, boring and predictable movie. They show clips of the group and others during the longest credits in history after the movie ends as it started with the police investigation screen.
No nudity, but a fair amount of cursing including the F...word and NO GORE, BLOOD or VIOLENCE, but a whole lot of boring air time!",1449619200,10,1489,4.321428571428571

4521118,2,B00519BOY6,Interesting and promising after a very slow start.  But unfortunately it never accelerated beyond creepy despite a valiant collective effort by the cast. If someone makes a low budget movie with little investment in special effects then the plot requires  some effective twists and better camera gimmicks. I'm glad it didn't careen into the tired clich slasher film. Yet Evil Things left too much imagination with regard to the demise of the film's victims.  It wasn't a bad movie and could've been much better. Evil Things is similar to other stock footage type films but since it bears much resemblance to previous films (ie. The Blair Witch Project) it fell short on eliciting the needed emotional response from the audience as a result of the film's action which was sadly restrained by the plot.,1420416000,,800,4.955223880597015

4521122,4,B00519BOY6,"After watching this again I decided to change this from a one to 4 stars.

That's a big jump, but I think Dominic Perez did a fine job and succeeded in creating an eerily realistic psychological horror story/murder mystery; rather than a film about demonic entities; in spite of the bizarre sound effects and the actors terrified expressions at what only appear to be possible supernatural events.

I liked the believable and even handed casting and all the technical aspects are quite good.
The final afternoon and evening street shots filmed in NYC are no mere promotions for tourism; rather they are skillfully employed as an extremely clever and frightening visual device to enhance the entrenched aspect of psychological terror.

Although the film portrays the cast acting in the usual irrational manner consistent with films of this genre; this small infraction is easily overlooked. Clever red herrings are carefully dispersed throughout the film and are most effective at creating a gnawing sense of doubt that is essential to establishing a strong foundation for the build up of fear that encompasses the storyline.

4521123,2,B00519BOY6,"1.2 stars.  I really wish Amazon would finesse its rating system by having more than 5 stars.  Yeah, Evil Things stinks, but it's not as bad as some of the ones I've watched.  Not quite as bad, anyway.  With 10 or 100 stars, a person could really pinpoint reviews.  Probably Amazon has studied whether to have 5 or 500 stars and concluded that a scale of 1 to 5 stars is best.

Okay, movie review- it stinks.  Completely predictable as are most horror flicks.  ""Found footage"" by definition means that everyone dies.  Shaky camera, bunch of friends on a weekend trip, in some isolated spot without cell phone bars, one blockhead with a brand new video camera, blockhead annoys his friends with brand new video camera, lots of hokey screaming, really bad acting, and tons of stupidity.  Stupidity in the dialogue, acting, plot, production, etc.  There is a modicum of originality- the end credits edit back and forth between the credits and a recap of the movie in snippets from the point of view of the killer / psycho / or whatever.  Don't see that much in any moves.  That lifts it up from 1.1 star to 1.2.  My guess is that some talented person in the production came up with that idea but any other good idea s/he may have had was shot down by the rest of the hacks.  The credit thing versus POV of ""Evil Thing(s)"" was a compromise.

Hardly worth the effort of watching.  I like some background B horror movie on my Kindle when I'm making cute children's toys in my basement wood shop.  I scanned through a dozen movies before settling on this one.  By the time I realized this flick was hopeless, I had my fingers covered in adhesive goo and couldn't touch the Kindle so I was stuck (no pun intended).  The good news is that I could run my belt sander for a minute or so and not miss anything because it was just that predictable.",1415491200,4,1835,4.42089552238806

However, I found some of the characters annoying especially Tanya. She goes for the weekend with her friends and does nothing but moan and complain. She sits in the car and even in the diner with a long face on her. I've never seen anyone asked so many times "" do you feel okay, I feel so bad for you ?"". If the girl suffers car sickness, then take a pill for it prior to the trip or even some ginger ale and crackers for goodness sake. Then she didn't want to go outside with her friends because ""it was too cold and she doesn't like the cold !"". Then why go away on a trip to a cold place if that's the case ? I hate the cold too but make sure I go somewhere sunny when going on vacation. Why the hell didn't they make a call to the police at the diner in a public area and take the stalker's license plate number down ? Then when they find out the stalker is in the house, why didn't they all arm themselves with some type of weapon ? Like spoiled rich brats, they arrive at the house which has no electricity
and they don't know how to locate or find a fuse-box ? They don't know where a drainpipe is located ? That's pathetic ! What was especially bad is that we don't even get a glimpse of what happened to any of them. Was Miriam's body found in the woods ? Was anyone stabbed or murdered ? I think a better ending would have been if the stalker when he was sitting with his back to us and reviewing their video-tape , could have turned around so that we could see his face. It should have been someone known to them as a further shock. I liked the way all the credits were not listed at once. Instead the movie continued in between. I liked the poem at the end.

4521142,5,B00519BOY6,"Evil Things is a wonderfully creepy little thriller that has everything most films of this genre lack  a compelling storyline, really effective acting, and filmmakers that actually appreciate true suspense and know how to manifest it on film.  I love blood and gore even more than the next guy, but the reality is that blood and gore are often used to prop up movies lacking a decent plot.  The truly remarkable horror film does not require blood to be shed on camera and usually succeeds much better without it.  Evil Things is a case in point.  Ive watched and reviewed hundreds and hundreds of horror films, and Im telling you that I want to shout from the rooftops about just how good this movie is.  I really cant understand why so many people hate it so much.

This film works because it is wholly believable  and disquietingly so.  Lets face it: the odds are quite low that your camping trip will turn in to a fight for survival against a family of inbred cannibals or three days and nights of terror against an evil spirit of legend, that those quasi-friends of yours who unexpectedly invited you for a weekend on the lake are really planning on sacrificing you to some demi-god, or that some dude is going to stumble up to your cabin with some form of hellishly contagious, organ-liquefying disease.  Films with those kinds of plots can certainly scare you  but only up to a point.  Evil Things, in contrast, tells a story that you can envision really happening  and, just to boost things up a notch, it all goes down in a place you would normally feel safe and secure.  Im not talking about coming home to find some dangerous psycho waiting for you or waking up to find an intruder  thats much too quick and easy.  This story builds up the tension slowly, as the characters cycle through increasingly worrisome moments of fear and relief, letting much of the horror percolate in the audiences imagination before finally unleashing its full fury.  Its not at all difficult to put yourself in the place of these unfortunate characters, and that is a recipe for an avalanche of creepiness.

To say this film has no plot is simply laughable.  Lets see: five friends head out of New York City to enjoy a wintry weekend out in the country, at the home of one girls aunt, celebrating the 21st birthday of one of their own.  Their trip along increasingly snow-packed roads is made even more eventful by a case of road rage that eventually escalates into so much more.  I was quite impressed by the acting.  The characters are quite funny when they're relaxed and goofing around, and they seem genuinely frightened by the increasingly ominous circumstance they find themselves in.  These girls can scream with the best of them, to boot.  With a budget of just over three million dollars, Evil Things proves that you don't need a lot of money in order to generate visceral fear and dread.  To me, effective horror is all about the creepiness factor, and this is one of the creepiest films Ive seen in years.

Director Dominic Perez takes this template and revitalizes it into making EVIL THINGS into a moderately scare delight.
We're introduced to a car full of All-American college kids--two boys, three girls--who are traveling to a friend's manor out in the snowy woods. On the way, a van begins to play games with them--honking its horn, cutting in front of them and forcing them to drive slow. We sense this is going to be a crucial fear factor later on.
But for the next 50 minutes, we watch the photographed antics of the group as they have a birthday party, they sit around and get drunk. The next day they get lost in the snowy woods. Since it's not snowing, one wonders why they couldn't just follow their own footsteps back into the house.
All this time we're waiting for SOMETHING to happen and it finally does--heralded by phone calls, a pounding on the front door, a package left on the steps, a videotape made by someone whose gotten into the house at night and filmed them asleep.
when the creeper finally comes into the house, the girls all shriek and run upstairs and wait for the boys to protect them. I was surprised that these healthy, strong girls behaved so idiotically. Not only did they do nothing to protect themselves, they never even armed themselves with a butcher knife, a heavy vase, nothing.  They were like throwbacks to women characters in films of the past. They stood by weakly, offering no aide to their male protectors.
The movie ends on a disturbing note. We have no idea what happened to the group. While the credits roll, we see curious scenes of a stalker in NYC, and another scene perhaps of the killer, while he watches several TV screens, including the footage he shot in the death house.

The characters are the worst kind of mal-adapted pinheads, the plot is contrived and confused (probably the greatest accomplishment in the movie).

The last 30 minutes don't do much better, and save for a couple of moments where you think there just might be a glimmer of potential, they whiz it right down their collective leg.

The found footage genre has long since lost its novelty, and only really works when you have engaging characters you care about, anyway. This concept is lost on the production team for Evil Things.

It's the story of five college-aged kids, two guys and three girls, including a little cutie named Tanya, who decide to take-off on a vacation to the middle of nowhere. Things get weird early on and, despite some minor technical blunders, like non-diegetic drones in a ""film"" that's supposed to be shot from a character camera, it's interestingly creepy in a Blair Witch Project sort of way. That is until the final third when the one-camera narrative perspective is betrayed and everything quickly falls apart. The ending is anticlimactic and the epilogue, boring and unnecessary backstory footage, goes on for way too long.

4521168,4,B00519BOY6,This movie actually scared the hell out of me. After reading the bad reviews I was not expecting much and decided to watch it anyway.  Evil Things is not about gore and hardcore violence.  It's about subtelty and it builds a creepy atmosphere. Things get worse and worse until the end.  What bothers me most is all the unanswered questions.  This movie is like a complcated jigsaw puzzle.  It was scary because it was so realistic too.  I watched it in daylight and it disturbed me very much.  I'm still arguing with my sister about what happened.,1359676800,,547,4.577319587628866
4521169,1,B00519BOY6,"Evil things was a movie with a reasonably decent plot - being stalked by a psychopath(s). However, the plot and story line was poorly executed in this movie although the concept (first person video recording similar to Quarantine, CLoverfield and Paranormal Activity) was novel.

Believe me - the description of this movie does nothing to help understand. The movie is about 90 mins long and took about 50-60 minutes to get some semblance of interest. Admittedly there were some scenes which were a bit edgy but there is no semblance of beng able to decipher what happended. All you do know is that there is a stalker(s) and that's it.

The acting was flaky and there was too much non-essential information and unrelated dialogue throughout. When the movie finally ended I was just left hanging and thoroughly confused. Then the credits  began to show and throughout the credits, there was a repeat of footage throughout the movie (with some additional scenes). I thought to myself that this should shed some light on what happedned - but was still left in the dark at the very end.

Evil Things is a really stupid movie. The concept was okay but because of the poor acting, un-necessary dialogue, poor character development, disjointed flow and the abrupt ending, this movie just went down the drain.",1358899200,3,1301,4.873303167420814

One of the characters has a video camera and records what we know is going to be a harrowing trip for him and his friends. However, rather than dealing with the supernatural, these characters encounter an all too real possibility.

When some friends and I were discussing why we like horror films so much, someone suggested that such films give us a chance to rehearse what we would do if faced with threatening circumstances. If that's one of the bonus appeals of a scary film, then ""Evil Things"" has appeal aplenty.  The viewer soon realizes, ""This could really happen!"" In some very inkling form, it probably has happened to a lot of us already on our road trips.

""Evil Things"" continues to imitate life even after the credits roll and beyond. So keep watching. And be sure to check out the bonus features as well. The film maintains its fiction right on into these extras, to the extent that the fiction takes on the cast of fact.

4521174,1,B00519BOY6,"My review contains spoilers.

This film borrow heavily from The Blair Witch Project. In fact, in some places, it's almost identical. Straight from the opening cut as the kids are leaving home and getting in the car, we realize this film is mirroring Blair Witch in a distorted way. This film blatantly rewrites some of Blair Witch's scenes even down to talking about food, doing interviews, etc. They even get lost in the woods, which, in my book was stupid. They carry on about being lost, oh what do we do, we are lost, we will die here. Well, since it did snow heavily the night before, and it's not snowing now, maybe follow your own tracks back. bet you never thought of that, little Einsteins!

The characters are very uninteresting. Only at one point, the lead female puts on a man's wig, and acts like another character's mother, does the film get entertaining.

The film took almost 50 minutes of bad acting before anything really interesting happens. And that is when a video tape shows up on the front porch. They watch the tape and realize they themselves have been watched. That concept was chilling. But that was it for spooky parts. There were a few minor ones after that, but, that's not even really worth the time or money to sit through this for that thrill.",1321660800,34,1276,4.587719298245614

From the trailer i thought for sure it was going to be something it was not. Almost like a paranormal activity type.

The story was ok but definately something we have all seen a thousand times already. Typical cookie cutter shot on home movie crap.

What you see is mainly a videotape made by one of the group members as they travel to a remote vacation home in a snowstorm and end up being cut off in every way from help.

4521180,1,B00519BOY6,"This movie is TERRIBLE! IT has NO plot. What you read above is all there is (only worse.)

The ""crazed"" stalker is just someone who honked at their car and passed them, only later to be found stopped ahead for whatever reason. That is the movies crazed stalker. They get freaked out when they see the van in a -- hold your breath kids -- gas station filling up on gas. Wow. That has the thumb print of Satan all over it, right?

The guy has this impossibly big camera. It's somewhat smaller than the ones they use nowadays. It was the kind you have to put on your shoulder and he seemingly carried it everywhere. That must be some very strong battery (and arm muscles.)

These kids are the only kids who can get lost outside after a snow storm. They were all freaking out about ""being lost"". It wasn't snowing nor was there a wind. The camera guy panned around to show evidence of animal tracks but the snow was largely untouched (and the animal tracks couldn't have been made by an animal larger than a cat.) I wanted to say, FFS! Turn around, look down, and follow your tracks. Then again we wouldn't get award winning lines like ""is that... AN ANIMAL?!"" They're in a foresty area. One of the guys says ""what? An ANIMAL?! Here? In the WOODS?! NEVER!""

The tension goes up when the poor, haunted kids get a two crank calls and a pounding at the door. After the prerequisite screaming, tears and OMIGAHS!, one goes out to see a present was left. Was it a dead animal? Nope. A poor, mutilated doll that said ""your next""? Nah. Satanic symbols painted on the porch with obviously fake blood? Uh uh. It was a video tape. Do our heros A) call the cops? B) Get the hell out of dodge? C) get some weapons to protect themselves? or D) watch the movie?

I think the fact that they had whoever this thing way was filming them because they probably thought halfway through the movie that having the main video guy holding the camera would seem... I don't don't. I little unreal. ;P I don't know why, though. We learn nothing. The guy tells one of the girls to hold his camera and to make certain she gets a shot of whoever that person is, but we never see it.

We never see why this person was after them too. I have a very hard time believe that because someone honked twice behind you, sped up and passed you, than you seeing him at the side of the road warrants some psycho insane stalker thing.

You don't see anything that happens to the kids. The cover is the face one of the girls makes. We don't see why or what happens afterward. My face was stuck in that position after I finished this movie (the HORROR! HORROR!) It still is, which was awkward at work last night.

For some reason they tacked on 10 minutes of random shots of central park in the fall. There is no given reason for this, but honestly I wasn't surprised. They probably said ""WTF. If they've watched it this far than they've earned it."" That was almost funny too. I mean, it was all random people until the camera man saw a couple actors being filmed than focused entirely on them.

Queue the credits (in which we see the ""scary"" video we just watched 20 mins ago.) This goes on longer than the credits. Some minutes after the credits are done we see a ""no animals were harmed in the making of this film"" (there were no animals seen in the movie) and then a random mishmash of nursery rhymes that they tried to make vaguely scary but failed.

AVOID THIS MOVIE! Though it may prove to be an interesting drinking game.",1312934400,29,3480,4.32361963190184
4521181,2,B00519BOY6,"Evil Things from Inception Media Group starts out with five college friends getting ready for a trip to the mountains for Miriam's (Elyssa Mersdorf) 21st birthday. Miriam's Aunt Gayle (Gail Cadden) has provided the group with a cabin and after a slight misunderstanding, the group settles in for their wonderful weekend out of the city.

However, before the weekend ends, the five friends are in fear for their lives as someone unknown to them has followed them from the city and is playing a psychological game with their heads.

The first night they get drunk and have a great birthday celebration. The next day the five go on a hike to look for ancient Native cave drawings and they become lost in the woods. After hours and hours of searching, night has fallen, the group is getting scared and nervous, they are finally steered in the correct direction by the ""animals"" that they are hearing. Thankful to have ""found"" their way back to the cabin, they head inside to get warmth and food.

Later on in the night, the phone rings but no one is on the other end and there is a knock at the door. When they answer it, they find a package. The contents of the package freak the group out and they try to flee their surroundings and get back to civilization. However, it may be too late as each of the group go missing and there are no clues as to what or who is tormenting them.

The movie is shot Blair Witch Project style from the camera lens of Leo (Morgan Hooper), Miriam's boyfriend. It contains all the jostling and bouncing and out-of-focus shots you would normally encounter with a home movie. The audio is sometimes muffled, often you can hear them breathing or rustling as they move throughout the picture, giving it an authentic home -movie feel.

I thought that the backstory of the characters portrayed was long, tiresome and without any real direction. I would have liked to have seen more creep involved in this aspect of the movie. I think the movie could have done without a majority of the beginning narrative; I found my attention drifting while the first thirty minutes of the movie played out. As well, the opening scenes did not give me any real like for the characters in that I didn't learn anything about them that gave me a genuine interest in their adventure.

Laurel Castillo does bring a strong performance to the character of Cassy Crawford. She delivers it with as much finesse as she is able given the weak plot and poor direction. She is able to deliver a multi-character performance reaching into her depth and drawing out the fear and horror needed to give Evil Things a diversity to the characters involved, that would otherwise be lacking.

The interpretation of the antagonist in the story is definitely a creepy concept and it is outlined in a fashion that does bring the creep into you. In this, director, Dominic Perez, delivers the edge needed to make this picture worth watching.

However, we are given so little in the final outcome of the picture that you are left with more questions than answers. The added footage strewn throughout the end credits does not give any added significance to the overall movie, and I wasn't left with the impression that I needed to have seen it in order to fully understand the movie.

Evil Things is a horror/psychological thriller and is rated R. Its running time is 86 minutes and comes in DVD and widescreen format only. The Evil Thingsmovie trailer is the only extra feature included on the DVD.",1312329600,2,3477,4.649837133550489

A creepy van with tinted windows taunts and tails a car full of college kids on their way to a weekend in the middle of nowhere.  I wasn't expecting to like this film as much as I did.  This all felt so real; unscripted. The idea of being filmed by someone unknown to you is unnerving, when it's in the context of this movie. The second to last scene, that final survivor, the guy recording her unseen.  So terrifying.  I spent the last twenty or so minutes anxious with what the hell was about to go down.  But that final scene?  It just ENDING like that?  That's like going to sit down and someone pulls your chair away.  It totally sucks.  I'm going to assume that group of kids was his new target, but who knows.  Other than the ending, this was a great suspenseful, scary movie.",1525996800,,832,4.337662337662338

8452483,4,B00519BOY6,"I was obviously on a different wavelength than most of the reviewers here I guess, because I actually was fairly impressed with this film.  I wasn't expecting to like it, to be honest.  I was expecting another poor attempt at filmmaking that I could enjoy laughing at.  But much to my surprise, I found myself drawn in, and getting tense as events unfolded.  Maybe it's just I'm on the same wavelength as the filmmakers, in finding that situation pretty scary.  I thought they built up the tension very naturally and realistically, from the first encounter with the van on the highway, all through the subsequent and escalating seriousness of events.  I also thought the characters portrayed more or less the appropriate level of emotions at each stage.  I will admit I personally thought they ramped it up into full-blown panic a little sooner than I believed they should, but then I tempered my judgement by thinking these were just people totally unprepared in every way for a situation such as this.  They merely exhibited the behavior of people who let fear gain the upper hand, instead of getting a grip and making a concerted plan to deal with the situation.  (After all, they outnumbered the bad guy 4 to 1; they just didn't use it to their advantage.)

Anyway, I thought that overall this film was very well-paced and showed considerable talent on the filmmaker's part.  The acting was good, and the characters, if not exactly lovable, were not obnoxious and were generally easy to tolerate.  To me it had an overall feel of genuine reactions to circumstances, enough to draw me in much more than I ever expected.",1525132800,,1622,4.774193548387097

Another thing that bugged me was the night vision scene where the girl is creeping around in the dark unable to see. Clearly there is a light source present. If the stalker is using a video camera then the screen would emit a glow she'd have been able to see.
