7841919,2,6303250106,"The intro basically showed the whole pilot for you. The rules of the Slammers universe are vague and often contradicted themselves. The lead kid is bland and forgettable. Not to mention, ""The Shining"" thing was too much. You get a feel for Shadow Slammer and Sun Slammer but the rest are rushed. The Animation is pretty good. The action is pretty good but it's also cluttered and rushed too. The Villains are bland and phoned in a mile away.  Overall, A so-so at best. I give this cartoon a 2 out of 10.",1346025600,3,503,4.408602150537634
