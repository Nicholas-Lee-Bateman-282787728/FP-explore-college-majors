8622607,5,B00GFC4CMY,"This is a great documentary about a rivalry held over from Civil War days between people of two adjacent states.  Today instead of muskets, bayonets and canons the battles take the form of demolition derby competition with cars smashing into each other, usually at rural county fairgrounds.

Demolition derby as a sport and culture is gradually dying off due as much to a lack of suitable old cars as to changing times.  The movie shows plenty of action while interviews with Kansas driver Mac McClanahan of the team We Ain't Stupid and Missouri driver and race promoter Greg Clemmons tie the story together.

The production is the result of collaboration between Kansas City movie producers Patrick Sumner and Chris Snipes with contributions from numerous local videographers and photographers.  It premiered in 2013 at Kansas City area movie theatres and has been broadcast on public television.",1383868800,3,897,5.158620689655172
