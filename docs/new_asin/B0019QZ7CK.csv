8602796,5,B0019QZ7CK,"I enjoyed watching this video many years ago, and it was very helpful and informative for someone with no snowboarding knowledge.  They even teach you the names of the different types of jumps.  I haven't ventured into the park jumps or pipe yet, but hope to try the pipe someday.  I'd say I'm an intermediate now.  This is maybe the 3rd copy of this dvd that I'm buying to give away to friends.  Watching this dvd makes me want to go out and practice and get better.",1356912000,,467,4.32183908045977
