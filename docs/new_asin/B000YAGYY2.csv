3023531,5,B000YAGYY2,"There are two types of people. Book people and TV/Movie people.

Having said that, I am a book person.

Books rarely disappoint, because they require you to use your imagination to provide the pictures and voices. It's not done for you while you stare at a screen constantly being interrupted by commercial breaks, or sit in a dark theater surrounded by people who are more interested in commenting loudly on the goings-on on screen, or busy texting on or answering their cell phones during the movie you just paid 9.00$ for a ticket to watch, when you really should have just waited to rent the DVD.

Well, having been a long-time James Patterson fan (at least of his Alex Cross novels and his Women's Murder Club series), I admit I was a little iffy about the WMC becoming a TV series. I mean, everyone knows what happens when someone tries to make a book into a movie or TV show. We either end up with The Da Vinci Code (the book virtually being read to us on the big screen - with a few small changes), or we end up with something so twisted around and far from the original story that it's nearly unrecognizable. But, I loved the books so much, I decided to be fair and give the TV series a chance.

Women's Murder Club was neither. I know it didn't follow the books EXACTLY, but it was wonderful, just the same. Completely NOT what I expected - soooo much better.

I hate television, because when a new series that sounds so promising comes out, I just have to set my DVR to catch it so that I can check it out, and then I wind up hooked. And just like when a cosmetic line releases a lipstick or nail polish that I fall in love with, it's cut from their line.

It never fails.

This is exactly what happened with WMC. Even though it wasn't 100% true to the books, I fell in love with the series right away, and after only a couple episodes, it was cut right after the writer's strike. I am REALLY hoping that the DVD release will include the un-aired episodes scheduled for viewing before it was yanked from the air.

The networks say they cut series' because of low ratings. That's because they aren't able to count those viewers that DVR the series but can't watch it right then. That's unfair. (Not that it's a significant number of people or anything, but? everyone I know was watching or recording the series. And I'm sure that there were tons of others doing the same.",1228694400,91,2381,4.3710407239819
3023532,5,B000YAGYY2,"Women's murder club is about a group of four women who are trying to make it in a man's world.  Lindsay Boxer (Angie Harmon) is a homicide detective.  She was once married to Tom, who is now in command over her department.  She is the main character of the show because she is usually the one chasing the killer(s).  When she runs into a problem she calls on the three other women in the club for help.  Claire Washburn (Paula Newsome) is a medical examiner.  She finds obscure clues that help Lindsay know to look for (there is more emphasis on this in books, though).  Jill Bernhardt (Laura Harris) is an assistant district attorney.  Lindsay looks for her to bend the rules or to turn a blind eye  when the time calls for it.  Jill, however, doesn't always play by those rules and will give Lindsay a new direction that is legal.  The fourth member of the club is Cindy Thomas (Aubrey Dollar).  She is a newspaper reporter.  She involved herself in the murder investigation of a collegaue by breaking into both the collegaue's appartment and her desk at work.  It was because of this that Lindsay allowed her to join in the investigation and their club.
The series could have been a great one, but caught a bad break during the writer's strike.  After it moved days, no one really knew when it was on or even if it was still on.  The first season was amazing though.",1216425600,90,1369,4.437751004016064
3023533,5,B000YAGYY2,"Four women form an ""old boy's club"" to solve crimes and commiserate about their love-lifes.  Ably handled by Angie Harmon, Laura Harris, Paula Newsome, Aubrey Dollar, all are quite comely, yet accessible.  Based on the best-selling book series by James Patterson, a volume author who has no less than four series of books out each year.  Characters have been well-fleshed out with forbidden loves and rich back-stories that cried out for development had ABC not axed this promising program.  Meanwhile ABC stands by its line-up of ironically-genred 'reality series'.
Harmon is devastatingly smoky, but often shows her character to be a down-and-dirty capable cop with a human flaw or two.  Laura Harris is the Assistant D.A. who loves love and finds herself often tangled where she shouldn't be.  Aubrey Dollar is the pert local columnist that is drawn into the club and risks everything for them.  A can't-miss performance is portrayed by Paula Newsome, the meticulous forensic pathologist who watches this brood tirelessly, then goes home to her husband who is broken in body and soul.
Set in the romance of San Francisco nightlights, ""Women's Murder Club"" will tantalize viewers for years with what could have been.",1216166400,125,1218,5.152284263959391

3023575,4,B000YAGYY2,"Enjoyed this series even though it was only 13 episodes.  Based on the James Patterson books, these shows had the flow and writing quality equal to Harmon's future series R&I, and it is a shame this series was not continued at the time.  Spoiler alert:  the series concluded a season arc, but ended somewhat on a cliffhanger or a situation that was not concluded but was not a seasonal plot issue.",1500768000,,397,4.563380281690141
3023576,5,B000YAGYY2,"I liked the show. Pretty good. I vaguely remember it when it was on tv, because I remembered how a few of the episodes ended. Not the best show, but  I liked the dynamic between the women, and it was good enough that I wished there was a 2nd season. It was odd seeing Angie as Lindsey Boxer after seeing her as Jane Rizzoli for 7 seasons. The characters are very similar, to me. But you can see how much she's grown as an actor from Boxer to Rizzoli, too.",1499126400,3,455,4.055555555555555

3023666,3,B000YAGYY2,"Frankly, I was surprised that so many people enjoyed this series. I watched the first episode and decided not to watch more. It seemed to me that the writers tried to put too much information into the episode with the result that the characters and plot were not sufficiently developed.

3023714,5,B000YAGYY2,"Very underrated show. If you're a fan of Rizzoli and Isles, Crossing Jordan or Bones this is a show you'll most likely fall in love with. Now that out of the way, time to get into the specifics of the DVD set itself. This set includes the first and only season of the show (which in my opinion was a victim of bad timing). In many areas (mine was one) the show was pre-empted almost weekly due to the war in Iraq. The network would run the shows pre-empted on a random night of the week between 2am and 5am with no real prior notice. The sad part is they'd count the pre-emptions as a ratings drop instead of giving it the time to grow. These days it would've been sold to Netflix or Hulu but that was then this is now. Sorry, I digress, the box set has numerous extra features, an attractive box and the most Important part is the discs fit snugly but not too snugly to stop from jarring loose during shipment. It was well worth the purchase.",1450396800,12,943,4.186813186813187
3023725,3,B000YAGYY2,"The show itself is ""probably"" at least 4 stars or a little better. However, because there are NO subtitles, I missed about 75% of what was being said. Most of the time I can get the general ""gist"" of what is going on when there are no subtitles, but not here. It's going to take me at least a half dozen times to watch in order to figure out what was going on or what is said. No extras either.

I was very surprised while watching it (I watched the entire 13 episodes over two nights) because it was so like the 'Rizzoli & Isles' series.

I love Angie Harmon.  She's gorgeous and she's tough but has a caring core.  This show seemed like the audition for Rizzoli, so if you are a fan of that show, you will enjoy this series just as much.  It really is too bad that ABC didn't renew it for a second season.  Of course, if they'd done that, we probably wouldn't have 'Rizzoli & Isles'.  Either way, we as viewers are the winners.",1424390400,,709,4.161764705882353

Name just one more show that puts the focus on more than two women, in law enforcement, and has them working together with respect as well as being friends. Showrunners Sarah Fain & Elizabeth Craft took James Patterson's book series to TV in a loving and respectful way, showing a glimpse of a better TV world. Their work, and that of the actresses, has never gotten the recognition it deserved. We can't turn back the time, but at least could ABC and 20thCenturyFox give us DVDs. The audience is still out there. This is why we launched a new campaign on Twitter (see @wmcday1), and hopefully, when those DVDs come out, they will include the unaired pilot and bloopers, the same regard that has been given to TV shows that did not nearly have the same quality.",1329177600,11,904,4.58641975308642

3258028,5,B000YAGYY2,"There are two types of people. Book people and TV/Movie people.

Having said that, I am a book person.

Books rarely disappoint, because they require you to use your imagination to provide the pictures and voices. It's not done for you while you stare at a screen constantly being interrupted by commercial breaks, or sit in a dark theater surrounded by people who are more interested in commenting loudly on the goings-on on screen, or busy texting on or answering their cell phones during the movie you just paid 9.00$ for a ticket to watch, when you really should have just waited to rent the DVD.

Well, having been a long-time James Patterson fan (at least of his Alex Cross novels and his Women's Murder Club series), I admit I was a little iffy about the WMC becoming a TV series. I mean, everyone knows what happens when someone tries to make a book into a movie or TV show. We either end up with The Da Vinci Code (the book virtually being read to us on the big screen - with a few small changes), or we end up with something so twisted around and far from the original story that it's nearly unrecognizable. But, I loved the books so much, I decided to be fair and give the TV series a chance.

Women's Murder Club was neither. I know it didn't follow the books EXACTLY, but it was wonderful, just the same. Completely NOT what I expected - soooo much better.

I hate television, because when a new series that sounds so promising comes out, I just have to set my DVR to catch it so that I can check it out, and then I wind up hooked. And just like when a cosmetic line releases a lipstick or nail polish that I fall in love with, it's cut from their line.

It never fails.

This is exactly what happened with WMC. Even though it wasn't 100% true to the books, I fell in love with the series right away, and after only a couple episodes, it was cut right after the writer's strike. I am REALLY hoping that the DVD release will include the un-aired episodes scheduled for viewing before it was yanked from the air.

The networks say they cut series' because of low ratings. That's because they aren't able to count those viewers that DVR the series but can't watch it right then. That's unfair. (Not that it's a significant number of people or anything, but? everyone I know was watching or recording the series. And I'm sure that there were tons of others doing the same.",1228694400,91,2381,4.3710407239819
3258029,5,B000YAGYY2,"Women's murder club is about a group of four women who are trying to make it in a man's world.  Lindsay Boxer (Angie Harmon) is a homicide detective.  She was once married to Tom, who is now in command over her department.  She is the main character of the show because she is usually the one chasing the killer(s).  When she runs into a problem she calls on the three other women in the club for help.  Claire Washburn (Paula Newsome) is a medical examiner.  She finds obscure clues that help Lindsay know to look for (there is more emphasis on this in books, though).  Jill Bernhardt (Laura Harris) is an assistant district attorney.  Lindsay looks for her to bend the rules or to turn a blind eye  when the time calls for it.  Jill, however, doesn't always play by those rules and will give Lindsay a new direction that is legal.  The fourth member of the club is Cindy Thomas (Aubrey Dollar).  She is a newspaper reporter.  She involved herself in the murder investigation of a collegaue by breaking into both the collegaue's appartment and her desk at work.  It was because of this that Lindsay allowed her to join in the investigation and their club.
The series could have been a great one, but caught a bad break during the writer's strike.  After it moved days, no one really knew when it was on or even if it was still on.  The first season was amazing though.",1216425600,90,1369,4.437751004016064
3258030,5,B000YAGYY2,"Four women form an ""old boy's club"" to solve crimes and commiserate about their love-lifes.  Ably handled by Angie Harmon, Laura Harris, Paula Newsome, Aubrey Dollar, all are quite comely, yet accessible.  Based on the best-selling book series by James Patterson, a volume author who has no less than four series of books out each year.  Characters have been well-fleshed out with forbidden loves and rich back-stories that cried out for development had ABC not axed this promising program.  Meanwhile ABC stands by its line-up of ironically-genred 'reality series'.
Harmon is devastatingly smoky, but often shows her character to be a down-and-dirty capable cop with a human flaw or two.  Laura Harris is the Assistant D.A. who loves love and finds herself often tangled where she shouldn't be.  Aubrey Dollar is the pert local columnist that is drawn into the club and risks everything for them.  A can't-miss performance is portrayed by Paula Newsome, the meticulous forensic pathologist who watches this brood tirelessly, then goes home to her husband who is broken in body and soul.
Set in the romance of San Francisco nightlights, ""Women's Murder Club"" will tantalize viewers for years with what could have been.",1216166400,125,1218,5.152284263959391

Based on the James Patterson books, these shows had the flow and writing quality equal to Harmon's future series R&I, and it is a shame this series was not continued at the time.  Spoiler alert:  the series concluded a season arc, but ended somewhat on a cliffhanger or a situation that was not concluded but was not a seasonal plot issue.",1500768000,,397,4.563380281690141

Not the best show, but  I liked the dynamic between the women, and it was good enough that I wished there was a 2nd season. It was odd seeing Angie as Lindsey Boxer after seeing her as Jane Rizzoli for 7 seasons. The characters are very similar, to me.

Now that out of the way, time to get into the specifics of the DVD set itself. This set includes the first and only season of the show (which in my opinion was a victim of bad timing). In many areas (mine was one) the show was pre-empted almost weekly due to the war in Iraq. The network would run the shows pre-empted on a random night of the week between 2am and 5am with no real prior notice. The sad part is they'd count the pre-emptions as a ratings drop instead of giving it the time to grow. These days it would've been sold to Netflix or Hulu but that was then this is now. Sorry, I digress, the box set has numerous extra features, an attractive box and the most Important part is the discs fit snugly but not too snugly to stop from jarring loose during shipment. It was well worth the purchase.",1450396800,12,943,4.186813186813187

I was very surprised while watching it (I watched the entire 13 episodes over two nights) because it was so like the 'Rizzoli & Isles' series.

I love Angie Harmon.  She's gorgeous and she's tough but has a caring core.  This show seemed like the audition for Rizzoli, so if you are a fan of that show, you will enjoy this series just as much.  It really is too bad that ABC didn't renew it for a second season.  Of course, if they'd done that, we probably wouldn't have 'Rizzoli & Isles'.  Either way, we as viewers are the winners.",1424390400,,709,4.161764705882353

Name just one more show that puts the focus on more than two women, in law enforcement, and has them working together with respect as well as being friends. Showrunners Sarah Fain & Elizabeth Craft took James Patterson's book series to TV in a loving and respectful way, showing a glimpse of a better TV world. Their work, and that of the actresses, has never gotten the recognition it deserved. We can't turn back the time, but at least could ABC and 20thCenturyFox give us DVDs. The audience is still out there. This is why we launched a new campaign on Twitter (see @wmcday1), and hopefully, when those DVDs come out, they will include the unaired pilot and bloopers, the same regard that has been given to TV shows that did not nearly have the same quality.",1329177600,11,904,4.58641975308642
