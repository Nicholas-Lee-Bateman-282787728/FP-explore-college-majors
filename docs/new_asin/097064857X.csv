173577,2,097064857X,"After seeing 'Forever Tango', I fell in love with Argentine Tango. I took a few lessons at the local Dance Studio. After reading all the mostly great reviews of this DVD series I ordered Vol. 2 & 3. I received them today and started watching Vol. 3. The steps are very simple and easy to learn but boy....the instructors have no facial expression what so ever. Argentine Tango is all about Passion and I see NONE on this DVD.
I kept hoping to see the full force of Argentine Tango at the end of the lesson, well...that did not happen. I lost interest very quickly watching this DVD. I am afraid to watch Vol. 2, I'm thinking of returning them. I don't think it's worth the price.",1226966400,,679,4.354330708661418
173578,4,097064857X,"I have purchased 3 different argentine tango teaching dvd's. This is by far the best I have seen, it's clear and has enough repetition that you can learn from it.  You feel you are in an argentine dance studio, adding the very distinct flavor of this tango.  I recommend this teacher the most out of all of them. He is anrelaxed and experienced teacher.",1201392000,,353,4.5
173579,5,097064857X,This series is among the best I have seen in ballroom dance instruction.  Attending milongas (get togethers devoted to Argentinian tango)has been difficult without an understanding of the basics.  This three part series develops the confidence you need to attend milongas.,1127174400,9,272,5.609756097560975
