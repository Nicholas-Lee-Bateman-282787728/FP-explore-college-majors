Now July 2016 and DVDs still play well and going strong. Quality product.",1468281600,,130,4.6521739130434785

8304633,1,B001GA951S,"I own a Sing Along Songs already. I was just buying one for my daughter. When this came, the case wouldn't shut because it was stuffed with just random music cd's and dvd's from Living Scriptures. Two of them were actually from the series, but that is all. I returned it and Amazon gave me a full refund and paid for return shipping, so good on them for that.",1388707200,,359,4.217391304347826
8304634,5,B001GA951S,The box itself is a bit chipped and hard to close.  Otherwise the movie collection is in perfect condition.  No scratch and we enjoy the singing and stories as a family.  Good deal.,1333411200,,181,4.424242424242424
