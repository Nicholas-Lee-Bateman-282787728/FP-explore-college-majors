8259308,1,B0015OGRUC,"I want to make it very clear it is not the workout I am unhappy with, it is the VHS tape. As of now it is still stuck in my VCR and I a cannot get it out!!!
I have several Bender Ball DVD's and the workouts are excellent and very effective. As to why they continue to sell this as workout on VHS? My only guess would be to get rid of old stock. Do not waste your money. Wait for the DVD.",1452470400,,387,3.619047619047619

8259311,4,B0015OGRUC,I love this workout. It is sooo effective. But it only comes in VHS and this is my second one because the tape breaks after awhile. My second one just broke this morning actually but I know the routine and did it w/o video. But it is a great workout,1350432000,,249,4.0
