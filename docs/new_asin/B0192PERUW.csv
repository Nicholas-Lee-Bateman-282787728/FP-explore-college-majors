7561037,5,B0192PERUW,"Weaponized is a well-crafted, high energy sci-fi film that takes place in the not too distant future. It deals with intriguing ideas of the future of warfare without being to cheesy are over the top. Good way to spend 90 mins if you can suspend your belief and go along for the ride.",1456704000,3,283,4.3584905660377355
7561038,3,B0192PERUW,"The film takes place in the not so distant future. On July 4, 2017 an ISIS attack on the Pentagon kills Alex Norris, son of Blacksun CEO Kyle Norris (Tom Sizemore). About 12 months later Detective Mitch Walker (Johnny Messner) is dealing with a Manchurian style candidate who just murdered a group of people including a senator. Mitch starts an investigation and confronts a bunch of confused facts, simply explained using the word ""nanotechnology"" and not knowing anything about it or how it relates to the mega-Robot which had nothing to do with the main plot.

The film wasn't that hard to follow. Mitch was more confused than me. Mickey Rourke is now headed down the path where he will be competing with Eric Roberts for low budget shaggy bad guy roles. The robot at the end of the film provided us with a second climax but otherwise was just a silly add on. The drama aspect and soundtrack was on the made-for-TV quality. It attempted to blend science fiction with a crime thriller, but both aspects were weak making the film a bit boring.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Calls Arabs Rag-H@#ds for very poor effect.",1456531200,3,1122,4.661616161616162
7561039,2,B0192PERUW,"Weaponized is a thriller about a race to prevent the release of a robotic virus. After an attack on the Pentagon, private military contractor Kyle Norris (Tom Sizemore) facilitates the development of a bio-mechanical weapons program by Prof. Clarence Peterson (Mickey Rourke) that allows soldiers to exchange consciousness with a target, giving them temporary complete control. Intended only to combat terrorists and safeguard American soldiers, the program has become widely abused. Detective Walker (Johnny Messner) unwittingly stumbles upon the program and is forced to both shut it down and protect his young family from those who will resort to extreme means to keep it going.

Since Weaponized is set in the future, the screenplay has more wiggle room than if it were set in the present day. Still, as with any science-fiction film, its necessary for the director and cast to induce the viewer to suspend disbelief and buy into the story. Unfortunately, this never happens. Though it offers interesting variations on a typical movie about terrorism, Weaponized falls back on action pic cliches and stock characters, more concerned with razzle-dazzle pyrotechnic sequences than with characters that ring true. Neither Norris nor Peters is developed adequately and they come off as merely minor ingredients in a low-budget replication of better-scripted movies.

The film has a terrorist attack, gunfights, martial arts combat, car crashes, and explosions  the ideal recipe for an action flick. What it lacks is originality and a story that can sustain interest for its 91-minute running time.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include five deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.",1456444800,5,1692,5.422053231939164

7561061,2,B0192PERUW,I think Mickey Rourke's name is on this to sell this piece of garbage. He's in it for a few minutes and is always good. But there is a limit as to what even a great actor could do with this!,1459728000,3,190,3.658536585365854

7561063,4,B0192PERUW,"A decent indie action flick well worth a watch. The premise was intriguing and the acting was good for the most part. I particularly enjoyed Tom Sizemore's and Mickey Rourke's performances -- the latter as a professor of all things! Could it have been better? Sure, but for the budget they had to work with, they did a good job. Recommended.",1459468800,3,341,4.60655737704918

7561065,2,B0192PERUW,"There is some serious talent in this movie.....and there is some serious LACK of talent. Unfortunately, the few lukewarm characters pull the movie down and the background music - that never stops - is so loud, at times it competes with the dialogue. I seriously hope another director attempts a remake in the future, the original is a dissapointment.",1458259200,5,350,4.9491525423728815
7561066,1,B0192PERUW,"Poor cinematic and acting quality.  A cool billboard story, but, it failed immensely.  Try harder - spend more $$$ to deliver a quality B movie. This was an F movie. I got ripped off on this one.  It should be removed from selection.",1457827200,5,233,4.372093023255814

I guess it was someone's amusing little side joke. Well, it cost you one rental, and probably will a few more down the road, but I guess you don't need the business. Cordially, Disgusted from N.

8743600,1,B0192PERUW,"What do you call an action movie with no action, or a thriller without thrills? In this case, you would call it Weaponized. I got suckered into watching this film because it had one of my favorite actors in it (Tom Sizemore). However, his talents were clearly put to waste in this boring and confusing piece of cinema.

The main ""Hero"" in the movie (I can't remember his name and refuse to look it up) simply has no screen presence and has a personality that nearly put me to sleep throughout the movie. His character is two-dimensional, as are all of the characters in the movie. Most of the acting in the film simply fell flat.

To say that the plot was confusing and convoluted is putting it mildly. Even for a quasi sci-fi film (set in the futuristic date of 2017!) the story was just too flakey and unbelievable. I can only guess that Sizemore needed the money or owed someone a REALLY big favor to have gotten involved in this fiasco. He does seem to put some effort into the role, but the character is just so poorly defined and over-the-top that no actor could have salvaged his part.

Honestly, I like a lot of sci-fi themed b-movies, but Weaponized comes nowhere near rating a B. A D-, perhaps. This film fails on so many levels that it is hard to understand what possible entertainment value it could possibly hold for anyone. As such, I am astounded by some of the positive-sounding reviews posted here.

I wish that I had fallen asleep during the movie. At least then I might have had a dream with a coherent plot.",1461369600,2,1527,4.442857142857143
8743601,3,B0192PERUW,"In general, the plot, action and most of the acting was good.  The cyborg was not necessary to the movie though.  It just seemed tossed in.",1461024000,2,139,4.3076923076923075
