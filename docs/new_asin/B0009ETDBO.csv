8059777,5,B0009ETDBO,"concert and a few comity routine  fro the like of paul bear /sheer terror 45 minute set in the legendary CBGB's before being torn down and paul bearer strange humor in between song and the sound truly furious in sound and attitude.this show like many others sheer terror events they have some difficulties but paul talks his way threw it and the band starts up and hits you again with another round of insult to injury song lyics  DROP DEAD & GO TO HELL was in 1995 had much more of pauls rambling stories and salt in the wound style  humor but this reunion seams to have a purpose and vengeance to their set, last chance to se them live while the pummels your senses and blow out your ears with volume and leave you with a black eye after wards. Same as they ever were angry, mean, drunk, strait forward in you face opinions and back for retribution! a must have!.

8059779,5,B0009ETDBO,"This DVD is segmented into 2 parts.  The first half is a documentary, interviews with band members with some old footage of live performances thrown in here & there. You really get the history of Sheer Terror in it.

The second half is the reunion concert. Whats cool is that when you insert the DVD you can either jump to the concert section or the documentary. It also comes with a CD that has most but not all of the live tracks on it.

This DVD has a lot of replay value. The sound quality is excellent & the DVD has better sound than the CD. I've seen Sheer Terror live before & this DVD captures a lot of the intensity that I remeber from the shows. This DVD is well worth the $16.",1119398400,3,687,4.111940298507463
