893350,4,6304479778,"How much mun fun do you want, got Elvis Presley staring in a movie, you see him in love, and sining too. But how about another Elvis Presley. Believe it or not, Elvis Presley is playing to characters in this movie. I am giving this movie 4 stars because, there was one minor problem I had with this movie. There is a scene in movie when Josh Morgan (Elvis Presley) is willing to help Ma Tatum  when Pa Tatum is missing, and he does that after sh treats him. Earlier in this movie, when Soble promises the girls gifts on from the army, and they become to lazy to do they chores, Ma Tatum orders Josh and all the rest of the army of the mountain. If she treated me like that, and she needed help I would not help her and I would her ""because of the way you treated me and my army, you can do it yourself"" relative or not. I have also remembered that there is one song in this movie that is not sung by Elvis and that is ""Pappy won't you please come home"".",1044230400,3,953,4.015789473684211
893351,4,6304479778,"""Kissin Cousins"" is another film that is considered, by popular opinion to be a cheeseball. You have to try this film first and see what you think. If you like it and recommend it write a review here. I'd like to add that Elvis movie fans better listen up! If you like any of his films, POST A REVIEW FOR PETE'S SAKE! I see only 5+ reviews for his movies. Disappointing! In fact I see it on all products that's Elvis except the 30 #1 Hits CD which has 205+. MUCH BETTER! Finally we wised up on that one. Getting back to ""Kissin' Cousins"", Elvis does double duty and plays an air force pilot named Josh Morgan (my name, except for the Morgan part) and his hilbilly blonde look-alike Jodie Tatum. I'm still wondering how this film was done with two Elvis on the screen at once in some scenes. I agree with the person who said that Yvonne Craig should have been in more of Elvis' pictures. She's a hot potato. Again, give this one a try and rely on what your thoughts tell you. Elvis is still the King no matter what type of picture he's in. This one is pretty good, overall.",1036800000,4,1072,4.234146341463415
893352,2,6304479778,"Of the ""33 movies"" Elvis made (though some were documentaries), this was among the worst. I liked Harem Scarum better. I liked this more than Stay Away Joe. That's where this movie falls.
The music? The saving grace of most Elvis movies? Bah! Ugh! What an awful movie for music. What in the World were these song writers SMOKIN'? These songs are really, really bad.
You'll watch this movie because you like looking at Elvis, and he makes any song seem a lot better than it really is. But even when Elvis elevates these songs, they still don't rise above being clunkers.
Oh wait. There is a bright spot to this movie, and the reason why it received two glorious stars: Yvonne Craig. Land B'Goshen, she is HOT!!!! And the good news is, Elvis makes out with her! Yeah, baby! When you're a guy, you want to be like Elvis. If you're like Elvis and you have your choice of women, you choose Yvonne Craig. What a bod. Yummilicious.
Yvonne Craig in a bikini is worth watching this movie. And seeing Elvis. The movie itself really, really stinks. Too bad Craig wasn't in more Elvis pictures. I would've rather seen her as the leading lady in Tickle Me and Roustabout.",1017792000,6,1158,4.519047619047619
893353,2,6304479778,"If you thought that IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR was a weak picture, wait until you see THIS one!
For some reason, they had Elvis play two roles in this picture: a black-haired city boy and a blond haired  hillbilly. It was an idea that having two Elvises would certainly create  big box office numbers.
The storyline is quite trite, the black haired  Elvis tries to convince a family (in which the blond Elvis belongs) to let  them use their property for some army-related project.
The funny thing  is, while Elvis plays two roles in this picture, he isn't really shown any  more than in any other picture. Most scenes feature either the black haired  Elvis or the blond haired Elvis.
The songs in this picture are fair to  poor. The only real standout is the quite nice ""Tender Feeling"".  On the other hand, there's ""Barefoot Ballad"", one of the worst  Elvis movie songs of all time.
KISSIN' COUSINS is hard to sit through in  some parts, but it's still better than some of the pictures to come, namely  TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM.",960768000,3,1036,4.54054054054054
893354,2,6304479778,"Considered his weakest flick at the time, KC lands in 2K with a fairly low  EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR of 3 (of 10), attributed to a typically congenial  Presley, some bouyant tunes, and a generally happy atmosphere (despite the  reported 18-day shooting schedule). Careful post-production musical  deletions and reduction of running time would have helped. (Rating is a  high-2).",960681600,,374,5.491228070175438
893355,3,6304479778,"The Elvis movie formula takes time off from the usual frolic on sandy beaches, and shifts to Hillbilly Heaven. For those who just can't get enough Elvis, he plays a dual role in this movie. The comedy is lighthearted, and maybe even a little light-headed. The music is the '60s pop rock fluff typical of Elvis'  flicks. Some of the movie extras look as if they are practicing for an appearance on TV's ""Hee Haw."" The fussin', feudin', and fightin' is all in good fun. The sparkin' that passes for romance up in the hills is ""G"" rated, of course. The military wants to put an intercontinental ballistic missile on Walton's mountain, er, the Tatum family property. Air Force officer Josh Morgan (Elvis) is ordered to help acquire the missile site because he is a distant cousin of the Tatums. Josh's lookalike cousin Jody (Elvis in a blonde wig) resents the intrusion. It seems all government men are suspect because they might be ""revenuers."" When Josh uses the phrase ""ICBM"" to Pappy Tatum (Arthur O'Connell), Pappy replies, ""You do? Where?"" Shades of Abbott and Costello. This is far from the greatest movie ever made, but it's okay light entertainment. Aging baby boomers can relish the nostalgia. Knock yourself out. Enjoy the nonsense.",955065600,,1239,4.84433962264151

893470,1,6304479778,"I feel compelled to write a review of ""Kissin' Cousins"" to counter all the absurdly positive reviews of it on here. The helpful book ""The Films of Elvis Presley"" by Susan Doll says that "" 'Kissin' Cousins'.....is consistently singled out as Elvis's worst film."" I would say that there are also 2 or 3 other films that are down there at the bottom of that barrel. To begin with, it was the first film with Elvis that was produced by Sam (""King of the Quickies"") Katzman, so the very low budget ($800,000, compared to $4 million for ""Blue Hawaii"") insured terrible production quality. The director, Gene Nelson, had to make the film extremely fast due to lack of money, to the point that Elvis offered to pretend to get sick to give the poor guy a break. The story and script are really lame, with Elvis as a military officer trying to convince his yokel cousin (also played by Elvis) to allow a missile site to be built at his home.

Since Elvis was from the South I imagine he hated to be in a film that portrayed Southerners as a bunch of moronic hicks, which offends me too since I also live in Tennessee. And the music is totally forgettable since it sounds like it was composed by Hollywood song writers trying to imitate country music but having little idea what country music is really about. The only decent song in it is ""Tender Feeling,"" which was better quality because it was based on the pretty song ""Shenandoah."" The dance numbers in the movie are better than the music because Nelson had a considerable background in dance. The highlight of the movie is the numerous scantily-clad ladies, including Yvonne (Batgirl) Craig. I should add that the picture and sound quality on the DVD are quite good.

If you're new to Elvis movies please start with some of his better ones - ""King Creole,"" ""Jailhouse Rock,"" ""Flaming Star,"" ""Follow That Dream,"" ""Wild in the Country,"" ""Viva Las Vegas,"" and ""Loving You."" And his middle quality films like ""Speedway,"" ""Girl Happy,"" ""Change of Habit,"" ""Roustabout,"" ""Fun in Acapulco,"" ""Kid Galahad,"" ""Blue Hawaii,"" ""The Trouble with Girls"" and others are also MUCH better than ""Kissin' Cousins."" So unless you're an Elvis completest trying to see everything he was in, do yourself a favor by skipping this one.",1473033600,,2253,4.70126582278481
893471,5,6304479778,"It delivers on the promise of the title.

Also, there was some priceless stunt-double-that's-clearly-not-him action when he fights his identical cousin, reminiscent of when James Kirk fights himself in the mirror universe.

893473,3,6304479778,"Released in 1964, Kissin Cousins stars Elvis Presley as an army lieutenant whos assigned to the Smokey Mountains to talk a family of hilljacks into allowing the Army to build a missile site on their mountain. Yvonne Craig plays one of the daughters of the owner of the private mountain.

This is a typical Elvis musical/comedy highlighted by Craig and a few peripheral beauties. Its obviously not shot in the east, but rather the wilds of California, which was typical (e.g. 1962s Kid Galahad). Whats notable about this movie is that Presley plays a dual role, the officer Josh Morgan and the light-haired hillrod Jodie Tatum. Kissin Cousins is essentially the early 60s precursor to 1993s The Beverly Hillbillies. Its actually better, believe it or not.

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot at Big Bear Valley, San Bernardino National Forest, California.

The film is just backwoods Fun. No heavy thinking here. There's a ton of trivia going on in this movie even beyond the actors I already mentioned you can search for lots more. If you look hard enough you will find Teri Garr, Kent McCord, Joe Esposito, Charlie Hodge and even President Reagan's daughter, Maureen is seen as one of the Kittyhawks.

893830,5,6304479778,"This is definitely one of my all time favorite Elvis movies that he made.  I have just about worn out my old VHS copy hoping that someday soon this will be released on DVD.

PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD FOR US ELVIS DIE-HARD FANS!!!

Kissin' Cousins has Elvis appearing in a dual role as a soldier (Josh Morgan) and a hillbilly (Jodie Tatum.)

The story revolves around the armed forces attempts to take ownership of a backwoods mountain in order to build a military base, but the Tatum family who own and live on the mountain have resisted all previous attempts. The forces send in Josh Morgan (Elvis) when they discover he is a distant relative of the Tatum's. The film includes exciting fist-fights, surrealistically mountain and forest studio sets, and gorgeous Yvonne Craig as one of the backwoods spitfires who tries to capture Elvis' heart.

Does anyone out there have any idea why this is one of the only movies that Elvis stars in that has yet to be switched to a DVD version?",1160697600,2,983,4.594285714285714
893831,3,6304479778,"I enjoyed this movie overall, its clearly a silly farce--but I wasn't expecting anything less from this movie with the Elvii.  Elvis plays Josh (a military guy) who thanks to his roots in the same area as a mountain the army wants to build a missle launcher on, is recruited to convince the family that owns the mountain to lease it to the government.  Up until this time the family (about as hickville as they could make them) has been chasing off government people with guns.

Josh shows up and is instantly mistaken for Jody the blond Elvis, that gets fixed and Jody does not like Josh.  Jody seems to have a pretty small part actually, he is a bit more of a bum than Josh--it seems, even Ma and Pa depend on Josh in their times of crisis that happen in this film, instead of their own son, Jody. (Really Jody is a bit of a cad, as he foists himself upon a pretty military girl--litterly running her resistance into the ground)

The most memorable song for me, was the the one song Elvis didn't sing, Ma's lament of Pa (who has dissapeared on a possum hunt).  Elvis did a good job and I enjoyed his songs, but none of them are oustanding numbers.

I was pretty amused how inspite of this being set in the mountains that somehow (government paid for them in an attempt to win the family over) all of the girls end up in bikinis.  Yes! I want to run around the woods in a bikini, nothing like a little deer tick or poison ivy.

A fun and amusing film.",1150070400,2,1452,4.250909090909091
893832,5,6304479778,"How distressing that my favorite Elvis movie has been edited by MGM leaving out ""I'm Just a Smokey Mountain Boy"".  It cuts down on the opening sure, but it's a song that sets the atmosphere for the rest of the film.  It's a totally bizarre and unnecessary omission from the film.  It's somewhat akin to omitting ""Over the Rainbow"" from 'Wizard of Oz'.  The whole film is fun...Tommy Farrell is superb as is his mom in the film.  In fact, every actor turns in a great performance.  Elvis is totally believable as Josh and as Jody.  He never turned a finer performance in a comedy role.  The 5 star rating is for the movie...I'd give MGM a '0' for their editing.",1119657600,12,660,4.396694214876033

893834,4,6304479778,"I have to strongly disagree with those who rate the music in this Elvis movie as ""really bad"". Actually, the movie has several ""really good"" ballads. Admittedly, ""Barefoot Ballad"" can go in the trash heap, but songs like ""Tender Feeling"", ""Catchin' on Fast"", ""One Boy Two Little Girls"" and one that has been cut from my copy of the VHS, ""Anyone"" are great songs. The movie also features two of the great character actors of their time, Oscar winner Jack Albertson and frequent Elvis co-star, Arthur O'Connell. Both do great jobs in their roles, especially O'Connell playing Elvis' folksy mountain cousin. I got a kick out of those reviewers who hated Elvis as a blond in this movie when any true Elvis fan knows that his actual hair color was more blond than black.",1092960000,5,765,4.7164179104477615
893835,2,6304479778,"Elvis with blond hair?  Less than memorable songs.  Not to mention an Elvis who is less than in his prime.  Incest is never a good thing.  The only things that should be kept in the family are mafia business and heirlooms.

That said, in a way, it's a creative Elvis movie.  He plays a dual role.

All in all, however, I recommend avoiding this if possible.  If you want to see Elvis, try something better, like Clambake.

That's all.",1091318400,5,434,4.3924050632911396
893836,3,6304479778,"I bought this movie so I can work on my Elvis collection and I watched it for the first time in a very long time and I forgot how cheesy it is. I'm completely aware of the time that the movie was shot but come on. If MGM could make a pink bubble turn into the Good Witch of the North in the 1930's, then they could find a way to put two Elvis's in the same scene in the 1960's. When the dark haired one was in a shot, the other wasn't there or he was turned around so you couldn't see his face. It also wasn't hard to tell that when the two of them were in the same shot, one was a total ""look-alike"". I gave it 3 stars because the movie wasn't his best but it's Elvis. In my book, no one can sing or move the way he could. I don't think someone could look as beautiful as he did on screen either. I'm a HUGE Elvis fan, but this movie is just cheap compared to a couple of his others.",1088985600,3,884,3.7580645161290325
