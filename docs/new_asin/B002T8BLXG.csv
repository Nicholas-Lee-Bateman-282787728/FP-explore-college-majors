8618206,5,B002T8BLXG,"Dona Barbara is a great  movie based in the novel of Romulo Gallegos a Venezuelan author,the first time the novel was published was in February 1929 in Barcelona, Spain. Later in 1943 the Mexican Movies Producers made this movie with the beautiful Maria Felix(Dona Barbara) and Andres Soler(Santos Luzardo) a wonderful Mexican actor. The movie was a great success. I am so glad that I found this movie here in Amazon, I watched when I was a kid and I will love to buy it and watch it again. Thank you for this opportunity to get Dona Barbara. It is an intense love story and drama.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dona-Barbara-Maria-Felix-y-Andres-Soler/dp/B002T8BLXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dona Barbara - Maria Felix y Andres Soler</a>",1320710400,,777,5.698275862068965
