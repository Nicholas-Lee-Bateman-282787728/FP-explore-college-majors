8303283,5,B001G0DCUS,"I finally got this dvd yesterday and it was awesome, i got to see wrestling at its best year 1999. Love seeing Chyna fight men, and it showed all the out of control issues with certain superstars. Absolutely amazing, i was so excited to watch these because ive never seen these so yes what a classic masterpiece to have for my collection. Was nice to see the build up between Jeff Jarrett and Chyna and other wrestlers. Wrestling isn't like this anymore, this was in your face fighting. Great picture quality",1423353600,,508,4.593406593406593
