8744037,3,B0195IIJGY,Not a fan if his style. Good material just not my cup of tea.,1501545600,,61,3.4285714285714284
8744038,1,B0195IIJGY,"I must say I am not a fan of this.
When he is describing things, Tom's eyes are darting around and he seems to say 'Um' an awful lot. . .  but that can happen to anyone, and while I would prefer more rehearsals and a better quality from a DVD, I don't especially fault him on his delivery.
I started with the walking at a heel lesson, and when he mentioned you need a choke chain, I admit I tensed up, but I had a trainer who has be using a prong collar on my GSD because he pulls so hard, and as such I have researched every style of no-pull and training device and have, as a child learning from my parents, used a choke chain before. My personal trainer went over every step of how to use a prong collar, and how choke chains were the similar, but because of how my dog pulled, I could not use one on him as he would hurt himself, and the whole point was to be humane and use only the tools absolutely necessary.
With a prong collar, the dog gets corrected on its own. You never jerk back on it, and if you do it's a last resort because they are doing something really bad, and it is a very short, light tug of correction, not to cause them pain but to get their attention.
I assumed it would be the same for the choke chain, as I was taught that they can cause damage to a dog's larynx and the sudden strangle can be shocking and scary. The whole purpose of using a training collar is short term, as well, and only when necessary. Police and military dogs, even some service dogs, will use a prong. They will not use a choke chain, but might use a slip lead as a back-up. I have watched professional trainers train with all sorts of collars, even E collars, and they always remind everyone that it is to get the dog's attention, NOT to hurt it, with one trainer who uses E collars telling me that it's a last resort for dogs who have tried everything else, and that if you ever have a dog scared/confused during a training session, you have failed.
Not in this video. He YANKS so hard that the poor dog he is training gets whipped around, and it's happy attitude switches. Tail goes between legs for a few seconds, and the dog starts looking around wildly, showing signs of distress and fear. . .  and it had no idea WHY. The dogs legs leave the ground he pulls so hard! I had to stop the video because the dog actually yelps in pain.
What does this dog learn? WALKS ARE SCARY. He's walking and if he gets one step ahead of the ""trainer"" (I use that term loosely here), he's jerked back so hard BY THE THROAT, mind you, that his feet leave the ground and then the 'trainer' is suddenly walking in a different direction.
Honestly, I'd have preferred to see a prong collar being used, without the heavy jerking! He also suggests a 6-foot lead for a walk where the dog has to remain at a heel? Why? Why not a 2-3 foot traffic lead which keeps the dog by you? As well as I can see, it's because he wants as much leverage as he can get for when he gives the harsh corrections.
Next, I watched the Sit chapter. He keeps jerking on that choke chain, and shoving down on the dog's hips. Do NOT do this to a large breed dog, especially, as you really can damage their hips and having their hips pushed down on doesn't instinctively teach them to sit.
Many times he jerks the choke chain and I cannot even see the dog doing anything wrong.
I took a class in animal psychology, and the spaniel he is using is showing multiple signs of distress. He is panting in excess, he is looking everywhere else except at the trainer. . .  this is not a well trained dog. It may eventually become an obedient dog using these training methods, but that is because if fear, not a desire to please its handler. The dog is first learning to sit only when the chain is pulled up. That's all. Why not teach it to sit at a command? Or a hand gesture? Why teach them not to obey unless there is a physical punishment to get them to do so? It takes this dog a long time in the video to figure out that heel meant to come and stay at his side, and that sit meant sit, rather than the jerking of the chain being the notification.
Even for recall, he uses a choke chain. And the dog is licking its lips-this is a signal that the dog is stressed. It's being corrected, it doesn't know why, this is a negative training experience.
Recall is important, and while hunting you absolutely need to have a firm recall, but why start out every dog on a choke chain? Even on the video he ends up screaming at the dog in Recall, because it will not sit.
Will his training methods work? Clearly, for some dogs, yes, as he has dogs who obey. . . are there better, safer methods? ABSOLUTELY. The dogs trained through this method aren't family dogs, they're tools and little else, which is obvious from the lack of respect shown to them.

Stepping away from the training aspect, this DVD series is VERY short. I watched the entire thing over again while writing this review. It starts out well! With a lungeline and a 1-ich standard flat collar. He works on s humane method to teach a dog to stay close by, to not go beyond the end of the cord, it really does start out very well, until he says that the use of force makes a good trainer. He says he tries to only use the required amount of force, but unless you have a very difficult dog who may even be a danger is not controlled, pulling it to a degree where it is stressed is unnecessary. Pulling it entirely off its feet!? Out of the question.
This is a very short DVD. I am not certain it's worth the price, as everything he teaches is rather basic, and essentially just ""use a choke chain and pull. Say good if they get it right, maybe stroke their head once.""
I received this product at a discount in order to review it, as dogs are pretty much my life. I have two, both rescues, one who is a love bug and one who is very stubborn. I have had to use strong corrections on the stubborn one, but I've never pulled him off his feet, nor will I ever.
I am not a trainer, but I work with many, and when told about the methods in this video, the response I received was ""don't ever start out with a choke chain"" and ""off their feet? We don't do that here. . . we try not to cause vet bills"" even to ""if I did that, in a class, I'd be fired before the dogs paws were back on the ground.""

Would I recommend this DVD? No. Clearly the training method must work on certain dogs, but I'd use it as a ""here's no other option, nothing else is working"" method before I'd ever use it as a standard training aid.
Even if his training works, I still would not recommend the DVD. It is very short, and even at the end of the video we don't see evidence that the dogs have learned anything but to respond to a jerked chain.
The same information in this video ca be found free online, it's very basic. If it were longer and showed a dog from the beginning of its training, to the end when it was ready to go, fully trained (though of course any dog will need practice and reminders occasionally), I might suggest it to certain people, or at the very least be more impressed with it. But at $17? The case it's in is flimsy and cheap, the information included could have fit on 1 single sheet of paper, if printed out. . .
Tom Ness does have a few champions and a lot of experience. But for me, I want a trainer that is more interested in building a positive relationship with me and my dog. I'd say I want to be a positive role model for it, not show it to cause pain when you want someone to do something. Research any trainer before you go with them. I'd suggest this to anyone considering paying Tom Ness to train their dogs. Buy it, watch it, and decide if you are okay with it. If you are, look up more about what he does, and go with him.
For me, personally, I won't be keeping this DVD.",1462838400,3,7784,4.1319261213720315
8744039,5,B0195IIJGY,"We are still using the techniques Mr. Ness uses with our 3 month old Australian Shepherd mix. She's a puppy, and she's picking up on some of this.  We'll keep using it.  We are not hunters. Disclosure: I purchased this at a discount for my honest review.",1462579200,,254,4.382978723404255
8744040,4,B0195IIJGY,"Even though I think that it is incomplete, I liked what Tom Ness had to say about dog training.  I bought a 30 foot line to help train my dog, but after second thought, I can use a shorter line because my dog is smaller.  Also, I like the part on recall.  Right now, my dog is a 4 month-old puppy.  Recall is limited and only when he WANTS to come.  My older dogs come when called.  He only comes when the other dogs push him, so this is helping me.  15 minutes a day is about his limit, so I am hoping that in the next couple of months, between his maturation and the training, he will be the best dog that he can be!! As far as incomplete, the video is only 23 minutes.  It would help to have more instruction on how to break certain bad habits, such as excessive barking, grabbing everything that they see to eat, or potting training.  It might be out of the realm of this particular trainer as he seems to start at a higher level for dogs (not really puppies) than the basics.

8744042,4,B0195IIJGY,"I liked this video, he not only explains the method but shows you. Bothered me when he yanked hard at times, but I guess with some dogs it would be necessary. I didn't hear anywhere about what age of the dog to start these trainings though?Now to start working with our new dog.

8744045,5,B0195IIJGY,We have had many troubles with our little animal listening and obeying basic commands after watching this video and applying the techniques that we learned we saw a huge change in our dogs obedience and behavior that quite frankly we had given up hope on.,1455062400,3,255,4.688888888888889
8744046,5,B0195IIJGY,"I received the DVD and immediately implemented his techniques on my 8 month old yellow lab Daisy.  Daisy's obedience training has been lacking because of a couple reasons.  We got her unexpectedly (impulse buy when breeder from our first lab called me"", we moved to a new house, we also have a 10 Month old daughter, and I have been hunting waterfowl 4-5 days a week.  We simply got too busy and it was easy to overlook the training.  She has a big heart and funny attitude but she is stubborn and more difficult to train than my first dog.

I was excited to use this DVD and Tom's no nonsense approach.  The DVD explains simple techniques that every dog owner should use when obedience training their furry friend whether they hunt or not.  Within a few days Daisy has quickly changed her temperament and she is excited to listen and learn.  I often thought this dog had circus music playing in her head but her hunt drive is really showing and this DVD is what helped get this train back on the tracks.",1452124800,2,1004,4.418478260869565
