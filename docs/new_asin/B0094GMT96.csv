5261325,5,B0094GMT96,"This is the first Wiggles video we got, and probably their most recent. It's from a 2012 farewell concert video filmed in Dublin, Ireland. There is a circus theme, and we get Ringo The Ringmaster (Simon Pryce, our new Red Wiggle) presiding. All the Wiggly friends are in it, plus ""New Wiggles"" Emma and Lachlan in supporting ""Wiggly Dancer"" roles, prior to their promotions. There are also a couple of other Wiggly Dancers/acrobats/clowns, Lauren and Katerina, plus the good Captain Feathersword, Wags The Dog, Henry The Octopus, and Dorothy The Dinosaur. The show is a non-stop barrage of classic Wiggles tunes. My kids are fully addicted to this DVD. Many of the songs are performed completely live, and some are in a karaoke style, with the main music prerecorded and the lead vocals being sung live while the backup vocals are lip-synched. Big deal. Most people don't care or notice about this stuff,  and you can't blame the performers. They are all jumping around like maniacs for more than an hour, and expecting them to also sing, do actions, and play instruments perfectly the whole time is a pretty tall order, and frankly unnecessary. Musically purist Wiggle fans are few and far between. But if they exist, they would be happy to observe that Murray shreds on his electric guitar pretty frequently and with some competence. The high point is a live performance of ""Who Is Captain Feathersword?"" with the whole song played live and the performers each challenging The Captain to repeat their song or trick, one after the other, while the Cap stands balanced 8 feet in the air. It's pretty fun, funny and impressive to see what he can do.

In special features, we also get a couple New Wiggles videos, plus a look at The Wiggles from other countries (South America and Taiwan), in the special features. Worth looking at those!",1363305600,2,1836,4.825396825396825

5261329,5,B0094GMT96,"This DVD is filled with favorite songs, dancing, acrobatics and fun. It is definitely great for getting your little one's wiggles out. My girls enjoyed bopping, twirling, tumbling, jumping, swaying, etc. to the music and seeing their favorite characters on stage. I love that The Wiggles help get rid of the couch potato syndrome. They make exercise fun.  I thought Anthony's splits were impressive and we liked the part where Captain Feathersword got up on the PVC pipe cube to do some acrobatics while balancing up there. My youngest daughter Zari loved it when Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog, and Henry the Octopus came on stage. When they exited stage she kept asking when they would be back again. She hadn't seen The Wiggles before and she loved them. My 4 year old daughter was the more active of the two while we watched the show. They both seemed like they were enjoying themselves a lot. We will miss the original Wiggles that have left the cast, but welcome the new ones for the New Year. I'm glad we have this DVD as a reminder of the original cast. Great for any fan of The Wiggles!

5261332,1,B0094GMT96,I bought this DVD for my kids for Christmas. They were so excited to watch it so we popped it right in. From the start we realized something wasn't right. When the wiggles talk there isn't any sound and when they perform there is minimal sound quality. I would love to own this DVD and am hoping it was a problem with just my DVD and not all of the Wiggles celebration.,1451520000,,369,4.138888888888889

5261344,2,B0094GMT96,"This video was a complete disappointment. I bought it because it was Greg's last concert tour with the group. However, this show seems to be the first one after they eliminated the Wiggle dancers which makes for a much less interesting stage presentation. There are long periods of relatively dull material, bad camera angles, interspersed with short videos. If you want a great concert experience, buy the 2006 tour video Wiggledancing Live in the USA.",1412553600,2,453,5.053333333333334

5261351,2,B0094GMT96,"My son loves the Wiggles - we inherited a bunch of their movies from a neighbor when he was barely a year old and ""Wiggles"" was one of his first words (seriously).  This live footage video of their farewell tour doesn't even come close to doing them justice. A lot of the footage is from odd angles, or from further away than you see in most of their other videos.  That may be great artistically to feel like you're ""backstage,"" but is lost on a three year old who wants to see the funny antics and faces they make.  We watched a couple times but this is not one he picks out.  I probably wouldn't care as much if this wasn't the only one for which I paid full price, thinking it would be a spectacular finish to a great Wiggles run.  The songs are still catchy, though.",1395360000,2,771,4.1824324324324325
5261352,3,B0094GMT96,"I wanted this DVD because it was the last live concert of the original Wiggles cast, which our family has grown to love over the last few months. However, my 15 month old twins have a hard time paying attention to this DVD. We have Yummy, Yummy, and Wiggle Time which they absolutely love, but I think because the concert doesn't have the close ups of the set and the colors aren't as bright as a fixed studio production, even the songs my kids like that are on this DVD, don't hold their attention very well. The Wiggles developed a simple formula that has made them the success they are. One of those keys was being able to look directly into the camera and talk/sing directly to the kids through the lens. You lose this intimacy in their concert DVD's as the camera angles often have to go wide to capture all the action. Maybe when my kids are older, they might appreciate this DVD. I only rated as ""ok"" because my kids are not interested in it yet. Doesn't mean that they won't love it later, but at 15 months, there are better Wiggle DVD choices",1395360000,5,1051,4.340101522842639
5261353,5,B0094GMT96,"Great video with the original Wiggles, my 2 year olds favorite Wiggles!  Definitely a must have in your wiggles video collection!",1387584000,,129,5.142857142857143
5261354,5,B0094GMT96,"Wiggles: The Wiggles Celebration is a super cute video that my son loves. My son is a big fan of the Wiggles and we watch these videos endlessly. This DVD was a very good deal at $8.48 and also since we have Amazon Prime we got free 2 day shipping. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone that has kids. The Wiggles are always energetic and the songs are always entertaining.

5261359,3,B0094GMT96,"I was very excited to get this movie because the price of the concert tickets to the Wiggles final concert were too expensive. After watching the dvd of their last concert I was not only sad that the Wiggles are over, but could completely see why. Obviously they are older now. I understand they are in their mid 50s and up. However, they moved around like they are MUCH older. Except for Anthony who has always been a bit of a ham for attention. And the concert footage was a bit boring. They used to do it up 'big' but the stage set was small and the 'antics' just weren't there. They also didn't do many of their original hits. We have over 25 Wiggles dvds. We have Wiggles toys and room dcor. After watching the dvd,  I see why they are retiring. It's a sad day....",1365120000,,769,4.2312925170068025
5261360,4,B0094GMT96,"First off this isn't the last show they did, that one was in Australia, and if you've seen some of the final tour on You Tube you might be wondering where some of the fun went. The DVD is a quick tight run of the songs but it has none of the between song banter and joking that makes Wiggles shows that much more fun, even the little bit explaining why the Wiggles were in the audience to collect roses for Dorothy and bones for Waggs would have been sweet instead of cutting away to the park and street scenes. Still it was good for a Wiggles show and they looked happy to be there. The smaller cast of about a dozen looks to have fun with each other, as much as I liked Sam he just doesn't have the same energy as Greg.

For the times some camera angles could have been a bit better there were a couple of interesting ones that would have been a neat addition as an optional feature. It looks as if they put a camera in Captain Feathersword's hat giving us glimpses of the view from the stage. When Murray heads to the audience to collect roses a camera follows him too. Hopefully they'll use the idea of giving us a Wiggles eye view of things later, it was really neat.",1363392000,,1172,4.140350877192983
