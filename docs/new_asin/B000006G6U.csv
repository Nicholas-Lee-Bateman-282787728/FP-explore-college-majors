7904429,4,B000006G6U,"Cashing in on the popularity of the ""gangsta rap"" craze of the mid-90's, Death Row Records released this long-form music video starring media sensation, Snoop Doggy Dogg in 1994. With a murder case pending against him and every parental watchdog group in the country attacking his controversial debut album, ""Doggystyle"", Snoop stepped in front of the camera for this movie short, directed by mentor, Dr. Dre. This marked the first time that Dre, who was considered by many to be the greatest producer in hip-hop, directed a film project.
Inspired by the hit single of the same name off his multi-platinum album, ""Murder"" features Snoop as a gang member who gets caught up in a drive-by shooting and sells his soul to the devil for a second chance at life and a career in music. Things go haywire for him, however, when the devil turns the tables and sends him to prison for murder.
""Murder Was The Case"" is both a long-form music video for the hit single as well as a brief documentary of Snoop Doggy Dogg the rapper as he explains how he got into the rap game and the influence of his music on mainstream America. It also features a collection of music videos and live concert footage featuring Snoop and his Dogg Pound Posse.",1058140800,7,1228,4.637614678899083
