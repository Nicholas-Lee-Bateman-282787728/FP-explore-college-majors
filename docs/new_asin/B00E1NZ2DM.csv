8600125,5,B00E1NZ2DM,I bought this for my mom who mentioned that she was having problem with her balance more than before. I haven't used it but I do know that my mom is using the exercise which is a big endorsement and is enjoying them. What I like is there is a variety of exercises so she can do different ones depending on how she is feeling.,1418428800,,325,4.015384615384615
8600126,5,B00E1NZ2DM,"I am in my mid 80's and over several years I have resolved several times to exercise, particularly for balance.  After an initial bright  burst of enthusiasm my good resolves would flicker out. Initially impressed with Celeste Carlucci's routine, I resolved not to review her DVD until I had conscientiously spent at least a month doing the work-out at least 5 days a week.

I can now report that the routine has become a welcome part of my life.  The success is attributable to a combination of a workout that is geared to my needs and an instructor whose sincerity, good cheer and encouragement shine anew with each session.  I have every reason to believe that people of a younger age will experience similar results.  Although a long time Amazon user, I bought this directly from her website where I noticed that an advanced program is also available.",1388275200,,855,4.743243243243243
