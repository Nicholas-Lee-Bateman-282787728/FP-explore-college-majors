3418780,3,B0018RCN54,"If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. Let me say, when Samurai 7 is good, it's GOOD. But it's more 'meh' most of the time. It's just a lot of mixed episodes really start to get thrown on halfway through.

Through disks 1-4, it's great. Slowly building up, can't stop watching feeling, it's wonderful. But after that... it's like it got dropped. Went downhill FAST. I was surprised, considering how well the show was building up. You'll be like... '...uh, really?... what?' It just catches you off guard how out of no where it doesn't continue to follow through with how well everything sets up.

I would say, definitely give it a watch. If you HAVE to own anything samurai, might be worth buying, but otherwise check out other anime. There is definitely anime out there that is better than this.",1218153600,6,797,4.527777777777778
3418781,4,B0018RCN54,"I had not seen the original ""Samurai 7"" movie so I had nothing to compare this adaptation to, which is probably better this way.

Samurai 7 is a great series, regardless of it being an adaptation or not. All the characters are well written and very interesting, also, the interactions they have with one another is a joy to watch. The music is also wonderful, fans of the ""Inuyasha"" anime will recognize Kaoru Wada's music touch in creating the soundtrack.

Action, comedy, seriousness... even a little romance, it has it all.

I will not dive into all the details of the series, storyline and etc., but I will explain why I did not give it five stars: two words: animation quality. The quality of the animation sometimes drops from episode to episode. During the fight scenes, it's pretty fast paced and well animated and the CGI used to represent the Nobuseri blends well with the surrounding cell animation...but sometimes, the animation and character designs drops to a horrible level... it looks like a bunch of sketch lines that we're painted and I just hated it... (you'll see what I'm talking about around episode 8 or so).

Still, I do not condemn this anime at all, I still love it. Although I got the cheap boxset, there are still some nice extras to be found in there.

One last thing I want to mention in this review, do not deny the dub. The actors did an amazing job, the dub is one of the best I've heard in a long time. Some of the lines from the original Japanese version we're reinterpreted in English, and they sound better than in their Japanese versions. Even if you're sold to original versions and don't go for dubs, check this one out, it's on the same level as the ""Cowboy Bebop"" dub.",1218067200,,1710,4.538961038961039

Amazing graphics, a wonderful story-line, the divergence from the movie is completely enthralling. I switched from Japanese to English audio every other episode. Wanna know why?! The English voices are also spectacular! (BTW both tracks are 5.1 on this set, HELL YEAH)

All in all, an amazing anime. I highly recommend this to any action anime lover. Can't beat the price either. Get this now before the price jumps up. (Like almost all anime does over time)",1216944000,,679,4.697478991596639

3418784,5,B0018RCN54,The series plays itself out in the beginning like a western then adds elements of steam punk all in a backdrop of a feudal Japanese society.

3418785,4,B0018RCN54,"This is an excellent action series. The plot is simple old fashion people against the corrupt government, but it has wonderful details full of betrayal and deception. The characters develop through the series and form tight bonds of friendship and loyalty. The action is outstanding with intense fighting scenes. Of course, with war there are losses as well as gains. The series moves along at a nice pace, but seems to get rushed near the end. For anyone who likes Samurai, and hold true to the warrior way, this series will not disappoint.  For those looking for fan service, there simply is not any. This series has a serious plot with character growth and a hint of romance. There remains some comical relief that seems to come in just the right places. This could have been a five star, but the ending seemed to be lacking, but it leaves you with satisfied and wanting more.",1366156800,,879,4.670967741935484

3418787,5,B0018RCN54,"I am a fan of Kurosawa. I was curious how his classic film would be ""Cartooned"".
I was not disappointed. In fact, I was delighted at the imagery and characters.
A side bonus was getting my 14 year old son to watch Samurai 7 on a road trip.
He was so impressed, he asked me to let him watch the original 7 Samurai and
did a film report for this 8th grade english class.",1358208000,,368,3.9864864864864864
3418788,5,B0018RCN54,"This is one of the best anime series I've ever seen, and it all comes down to the characters. Each character is so unique and varied, but at the same time they work so well together, playing off each other in interesting, dramatic and often humorous ways. Everyone who watches this will have a favorite character, and I think each will have a different one (unless they're super smart, in which case it will be Heihachi, because if you don't like him best I don't know what to say to you, infidel).

One thing I really respect about this anime is that it has -weight-; this anime has messages to give, but it gives them subtly and meaningfully without forcing them - it presents them as they are, and asks you to decide for yourself. Everyone is three-dimensional and interesting, and the overarching story is engaging enough that you'll find yourself caring about everyone involved and awaiting the outcome to each decision. Characters -will- die during this anime, and you're going to be worrying about that throughout the whole thing - will your favorite die? Who that you care about won't make it to the end? Not everyone will. This lends weight to everything that happens, unlike with so many things.

I think this anime is worth watching for -anyone- because it's character-driven, but if you're an anime fan, this is a must-own, period.",1353715200,,1343,4.735042735042735
3418789,4,B0018RCN54,Such a shame that this show is so short. 26  episodes really leaves you wanting more action and story telling. There are also touching moments where you will feel for the characters. This isn't just about samurai its about the relationship between samurai and farmers. Don't buy this if your jot into slight fiction because not everything is 100% samurai accuarate. Anime fans will appreciate the gigantic robots and decent dialogue between the developing characters,1341446400,,466,5.213333333333333
3418790,5,B0018RCN54,"""Samurai 7"" is Toshifumi Takazawa's anime series remake of the original 1954 Japanese film ""Seven Samurai"" that was directed by Akira Kurosawa.  This film is both tightly and loosely based off of the original.

FIRST, CONTENT ISSUES FOR PARENTS:
  This anime completely strays from any such use of fanservice (the term often used these days to mean ""lite sexual material"" such as say, major cleavage, beyond-normal-tight-fitting and short-cut clothing meant to be sexually appealing, etc.).  Also, there is maybe one or two instances of the use of the word ""Damn"".  There is humor, but none of it crude.  In fact, this film is generally quite a bit more conservative than the 1954 original that it was based upon.  The only two things that I should raise to be fair are these: 1) the female lead wears very conservative looking clothes, but it does bare her midriff, and her skirt is mid-thigh length (some people may not like it).  There is also a slit in her skirt on the right side.  The thing about this outfit is that it looks very conservative and the animators do not even raise a single finger to try and exploit the fanservice ""opportunities"" they could have had with that.  The skirt doesn't even fly up.  If anything, they use it to differentiate her as a countryside girl from those of the imperial city...the old primitive versus refined gambit. 2) There is one bath house scene where the female lead and a major supporting female character are conversing about serious matters.  However, again, the animators do not ""exploit"" this.  In fact, the room is filled with the steam, all you see is either the shoulder up or one instance of the back torso (you don't see ""hind-quarters"", nor are their ""full-frontal displays"").  Anyways, there are tons of legal streaming sites you can preview the series if you really want to play safe and see for yourself (and I mean legal as in the site actually procured the license to stream the show).  Hands nad arms and stuff do get chopped off, though.  But it's not gratuitous violence and most of the enemies are robotic mechs.  Not much blood neither...mostly oil and diesel haha.  Ultimately, I would say this is a show for  teens 16 and older because a lot of the themes discussed and addressed are very serious, and would go over younger kids who are more into the action of things.  It does have good discussion value for sure :-)

MOVING ON:
  As I said before, this anime both loosely and tightly follows the it's predecessor.  Basically, it takes all the characters (with their actual demeanors and nuances) and carries them into a steampunk type world.  What this series does do to improve beyond the the original is this, while keeping to the same exact plot, they have embellished beautifully.  The were able to add more ""players"" to the field, really elaborate on the world and environment.  The best part was that, it actually greatly defined the characters.  Unlike the original, you really got to spend time with many of the characters' philosophies, history, and purposes.

BUT, like the original, this remake is just as ambient and slow.  There are many action sequences (and they are very very very beautifully done), but the focus are on the internal struggles and relationships of the characters.  It's also mainly about philosophies on warrior-hood and a good, fleshed out narrative.  In fact, one of many things you realize when watching even the fight sequences are that the sword can either be a mere tool of destruction or the soul of a samurai.  So if you are wanting the next ""hack n slash"", I would say go elsewhere...but if you are the thinking type that enjoys a story, this can be a good pick for you.  This show sprinkles a decent bunch of humor...but again, it's focus is not mere entertainment, but to raise and answer questions.

THE PACKAGE: Well, Funimation distributors created ""The Viridian Collection"" for a key reason.  They realized that many anime were expensive, both the individual volumes as well as the usual boxed set.  So what they did  was to strip many of the ""extra and unnecessary"" things plus find a stable but cheaper form of packaging.  And that's what you have here.  This particular complete-series edition is part of ""The Viridian Collection"".  The discs are safely and securely packaged in their own individual slim plastic cases (2 to a case at most), and the cases themselves are gathered together in a safe cardboard box/sleeve about the size of 2.5 standard DVD cases.  Unfortunately many of the typical DVD extras might not have been included (I don't know this for sure because, for this series, I only dealt with The Viridian Collection) but you still get the typical Director Actor Commentary, Promo vid and image gallery, & textless songs and character profiles.  Also, you still have the option of subs and dubs.  I watched both and the dubbing is actually pretty good.  If you are a person that thrives on extra features, then I suggest looking into Funimation's individual volumes or non-Viridian sets, first to see if there are extras you want.  But if you are like me where it's the story and show that matter most, this is a great and affordable deal.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a good and thought provoking look into the Japanese perspective of Bushido.  The world is beautifully crafted and the characters wonderfully developed and expanded on.  I will say this though, because of the nature of the show, it is very dependent on your mood.  I can't watch this back to back, but only once every so often.  What I mean is, you really need to want to watch it in order to enjoy it.  It's not candy you can pop into your mouth anytime...but a steak that needs to be savored and desired to enjoy.  So, if you want light and passive entertainment...I don't think this is the best choice.  But if you are ready for a feast of storytelling and active thinking, this is a brilliant piece.",1330905600,,5902,4.722113502935421
3418791,5,B0018RCN54,"I love a great animated show. I am a big fan of Inuyasha, Bleach, Slayers, etc.  I don't like reading long reviews, so I will keep it short and sweet. Samurai 7 has likeable and relate-able characters, good story line and development, and the animation is solid.  In a nut shell, my wife doesn't like anime, but she kept wanting to see the next episode and was sad after we finished the last disc (ha ha she was HOOKED!!).",1328140800,,422,4.329113924050633

As the episodes pass, the audience comes to know the depths of the characters and their motivations. The action is well paced and exciting, though the human samurai vs. giant mech samurai pushes believability a bit far. A small but nice plus for the series is post battle wrap at the end that closes on the uplifting aftermath.

3418796,4,B0018RCN54,"This is a great adaptation of ""(the) Seven Samurai"", an ""ancient"" (1954, I believe) Japanese movie which ""is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. (quoted from wikipedia article found at [...])""

It is retold in, what I call, a semi- futuristic Japan, where there are giant robots and floating milatry bases along side rural, old fashioned, poor, rice growing villages.

Colors in this retelling are rich and beautiful, very pleasing to the eye. Artwork is great and animation is also well done. Story line is simple and not confusing. Lots of action. Lots of story.

But...

Its the kind of epic you'll not want to watch too many times, too close to each other. It is very long.

But...

Its the kind of movie you WILL want to watch every so often. You most probably will wish you owned your own copy to watch whenever the inevitable urge to see it strikes you again. Definately worth owning!

Oh, I can't forget to mention...

I would highly suggest watching this only in Japanese because I found the English voiceovers very annoying and almost entirely inappropriate to the personalities of the characters.",1271289600,2,514,5.3875
3418805,4,B0018RCN54,"To begin, I was extremely pleased with the quality of disks and artwork of jackets and casing.  Most of the disks even featured well-placed animated menus with appropriate music.  However, some of the later discs lacked the animated menus, and I would label the entire set as lacking in extra features.  The commentaries were limited, which isn't a huge problem to me, but they were spoken by the english voice actors, which I thought to be rather upsetting.  No ""making of"" information or conceptual art.  What it does deliver are an increasing number of funimation advertisements and our favorite ""Mr. Stain"" shorts, which can be amusing, but were rather oddly placed.  Still, the discs were of high quality, and the cover art was quite spectacular.  Samurai 7 is an excellent show, and a must view for fans of anime or Akira Kurosawa (although Kurosawa himself might not have been too thrilled with the additions to the addaptation).  I am impressed with the depth of the characters and the stunning animation.  I was overall pleased with the production.",1266451200,2,1057,4.926553672316384

This series, based obviously on Kurosawa's tale, covers the journey of a couple of villagers trying to save their village, and the Samurai who join them.
the story and the detail, both, are of the highest quality.
The sound, as well, is very good.  If the series is lacking, in any way, it is in the same manner that most anime lack.
That is the apparent need to have one or two ""cute"" or humorous or buffoonish type characters, that while intending to bring levity to the series, in fact bring it down a slight notch as there presence, to me, distracts from the tale being told.
Apart from that gripe, I found this series compelling and almost too difficult to stop watching until the series was complete.",1265932800,,775,4.4822695035460995
3418807,5,B0018RCN54,"I have always been a lover of anime, but this one is one of my favorites.  I saw a few of the episodes about six years ago and just couldn't pass this opportunity up.  I must say that I still LOVE it.  The action is well-choreographed and there is good meat to the storyline.  None of the characters just hang out in the background while others bask in the glory. Each character has their own past(some grittier than others)demons to deal with.  Each character grows throughout the series instead of remaining stagnant.

My family (who aren't anime buffs like myself)actually watched this show with me for the two days it took us to finish it.  So if you like samurais, kick butt action, and a deep storyline, and well dimensioned characters purchase this boxed set.  You won't regret it.",1264550400,2,788,4.618705035971223
3418808,3,B0018RCN54,"At the time, I purchased this anime set because I was just getting into anime, and a friend recommended getting this series. Samurai 7, very briefly, is about a group of villagers who go to the city to recruit seven samurai to help the villagers rebel against the Nobuseri. Obviously there is more to it than that, but that's what the series is based on.
I didn't want to get into a lot of the storyline, or what this series is actually based off of, because a lot of other reviewers have already hit those areas. Instead I want to focus on the things that I liked and disliked in this series.

By far the graphics and the music is what makes this anime awesome. Some of the fight scenes are just ridiculously beautiful looking. I am not sure if it CGI or not, but the series is worth watching just for its breath taking fight scenes. The music is well orchestrated and flows just as beautifully well with the amazing picture. The story is pretty solid, though I was surprised at how they could stretch it out that long. This anime could have ended with a lot fewer episodes, but then it wouldn't have been as good. After a while some of the episodes become dry and boring, and you can tell where the storyline is going. It's obvious that the creators wanted the series to go longer, and thus its gets dull at parts.

That is my main beef with this series, and my other beef is with the characters and character development. Some of the characters are awesome and their development over the series gets better as it goes on. Kambei for example is just all around the likeable aged hero, and Katsushiro, as the series progresses, goes from being a dolt to a great warrior. But some of the characters are downright annoying. Kikuchiyo the cyborg has some pretty silly one-liners. And some of the other seven warriors aren't even in the series that much!

All in all, this anime is pretty decent. The storyline is very one sided, and the fact that it gets stretched over 26 episodes makes the anime seem boring at times. The characters could have been done better as well. However, the amazing drawing and battle scenes really make up for the depressing parts of the series. Honestly, I would say rent or buy this cheap, because there is a lot of hype behind this series, but at $25, that's not a bad price. I am going to get rid of my copy, just because I can never actually see myself watching it again.",1262217600,7,2402,4.417607223476298

3418810,2,B0018RCN54,"Overall it was a relatively good series. I've seen better.  The animation was fine and so was the character development as far as episodic anime goes. However some of the characters abilities were a bit to 'unbelievable' especially in the beginning where you see Kambe make a clean slice completely through an entire floating city.  There was no explanation of this ability other than that 'they were samurai'.  Also it seemed way to easy for them to dismember huge mechanized samurai called 'bandits', it just was a ""what's going on"" moment in the series.

There was a single episode where the first half was VERY badly animated in a completely different style. I'm amusing that the studio was having employment problems; and allowed an assistant to conduct the entire scene.

In the end however you become accustomed to the small oddities and get more into the story. Sadly characters die that you don't expect will, and the ones you think would die end up living. That perhaps was a nice twist on conventional samurai storytelling.",1258934400,2,1034,4.885714285714286

3418812,4,B0018RCN54,"I'll be honest and say that when I ordered Samurai 7, I wasn't really expecting to get Kurosawa's brilliance encapsulated in animated form. That said, the great man himself was fond of trying the impossible and I believe that he would have found the basic theory of the idea perfectly acceptable.

For my review I'm going to assume that you've watched the original movie, Kurosawa's 1954 classic ""The Seven Samurai"", a period movie set in the 16th century in Feudal Japan. A period of great unrest, many of the Samurai were forced to turn Ronin, masterless soldiers willing to fight to the death for a bowl of rice and a cup of water. Seven restless warriors turn their hands to defending a village of helpless peasants not for honour, not for profit - for all the rice they can eat.

Samurai 7 preserves that basic idea, but the details of the story are chopped around. You'll recognise each of the seven and some of the peasants too, but the rather wet love interest in Kurosawa's work is replaced by a stern young priestess and her irrepressible young sister. Whacky hijinks ensue. More time is spent on each of the characters backstories and additional plot arcs are whacked in around and beneath that central plank that is the spine of the story.

The writing is good, the dubbed version is actually pretty watchable and the animation itself mixes traditional and CGI elements acceptably, if not seamlessly. Although the tale twists and turns a bit, the bad guys are the bad guys and the good guys are always the good guys - and the central tenets enthroned in Kurosawa's work are held up here too - Loyalty, Bravery and daring to make a difference.

That said, this IS an action Anime show. The replacement of the eyepatch wearing and horse riding bandits with giant Mecha and battleships stretches credibility at times. You really have to understand Zen and Bushido to 'get' why the sword of a true Samurai can affect the biggest of these gigantic foes - even then it can look a little over the top. It is undeniable, however, that the makers had a healthy respect for the original work and looking for the many little homages that are densely scattered within this 'reimagining' of the original story warms the heart of an old fan.

I heartily recommend this Anime for any Seven Samurai fanatic or Otaku who likes action and Mecha anime. If you haven't seen the original movie and aren't a fan of mecha anime I rather more cautiously recommend it. If you're simply a fan of well made Anime looking for a new series, you can do a lot worse than try this out - especially at this price.

Above all, if you haven't seen the Kurosawa film and you really enjoyed this anime - go buy it!",1251072000,4,2689,4.58004158004158

Does this anime break my top 5? No it doesn't but I'd still strongly recommend it since the action and characters are about as good as you can get.,1247875200,,388,4.402777777777778
3418814,3,B0018RCN54,"So I just got done watching this and the first two thirds of this series were amazing.  I was watching it thinking I had finally found the perfect anime. They truly did honor to Akira Kurosawa with their adaptation.  Then they finished up Kurosawa's storyline and things quickly devolved into ""What? Huh? This is crap!""  I was quite disappointed.  So I give it 3 out of 5 because the part that adapted Kurosawa's 7 Samurai was truly worth of 5 or even 6 stars if you could rate it that way, but afterwards it was less than a 1 star anime.",1247875200,2,538,4.297029702970297
3418815,5,B0018RCN54,"Absolutely, Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI is one of the great films of all time, and, in attempting a remake, one would require a hefty set of stones, as well as ample funding and talent. In 2004, with the approval of Akira Kurosawa's estate, a top notch anime version, SAMURAI 7, was created and debuted on Japanese television. In this DVD box set, we get the entire series, consisting of 26 episodes on 7 discs. SAMURAI 7 takes Akira Kurosawa's original masterpiece and transports it from the 16th century to a war ravaged, sci-fi future setting. However, the tweaked storyline still chronicles the tale of seven samurai who come to the aid of a tormented farming village that has been subjugated by bandits; this time, however, the bandits are the Nobuseri, mechanically-integrated predators who themselves were once samurai.

You don't need to have seen the 1954 film to enjoy SAMURAI 7, though viewers of both will make rapid connections between the two. The makers of this anime did a great job of instilling into their project the same heart and intent of the original SEVEN SAMURAI. This isn't just a meaningless point A to point B anime action flick. Emphasis is thoughtfully placed on character and plot development as we actually get to know the players in this series, from the ragtag samurai, which the last great war has largely reduced to a jobless and purposeless state, to the lowly farmers, who are insular, abhor fighting, and fear the samurai almost as much as the bandits.

Although palpable throughout the series, it's in the samurai's stay at the Kanna village where the distinction between the two social classes become most pronounced as the bushido code clashes with the villager's less ""noble"" but infinitely more realistic principles. The bridge between the two castes lies in the form of Kikuchiyo, the boorish but exuberant mechanical samurai who used to be a farmer; this was the role originated by the great Toshiro Mifune. Don't get me wrong, this animated Kikuchiyo version doesn't even come close to bringing to the table what Mifune did. It just underscores how bigger than life Mifune made his character that this incarnation actually had to be in a mechanical shell to halfway compete. Honestly, Kikuchiyo here is adequate and, at times, nerve grating.

But there comes a time when plot and character development must give way to serious hind kicking. And, in these moments, the samurai do NOT mess around. The action scenes are astounding! You almost believe a regular-sized guy can take out a mechagiant. These key sequences are significantly emphasized by the blood-pumping score, which uses a healthy dose of Japanese taiko drums. The animation is very, very nice to look at, even if, at times, the CG doesn't quite harmonize with the 2-d animation.

Along with the sci-fi trappings, there are a few other significant changes that were made from Kurosawa's original film. There's a more impactful role played by the love interest Kirara the water priestess, as well as the introduction of her younger sister Komachi, who, along with Kikuchiyo, serves as comedy relief (Kirara and Komachi, by the way, are also Japanese brands of rice). Another change made is that, here, the samurai actually take the battle beyond the village bandits. But, listen, even with the sci-fi elements, the cool animation, the awesome battle scenes, I feel that the best thing about SAMURAI 7 is that it somehow retains the humanity of the original film. This really is anime for grown ups. The ending is still appropriately bittersweet as, ultimately, it's the villagers who win. There will always be harvests and harvest songs for the farmers. The samurai, on the other hand, just drift away. And the samurai leader, Shimada Kambei, who claims to have lost every war he's been in, has just lost another one...",1246838400,15,3831,4.962616822429907

3418817,4,B0018RCN54,"I started to watch this series, DVD by DVD, and was really enjoying it.  It is the Seven Samurai in anime form.  But they expanded on the story, so in the end the Samurai go after who is behind the bandits.  It can get pretty bloody and sometimes very emotional.  But there is also tons of action and lots of battles.  Swords and guns, robots and warriors, flying cities and hover cars.  Great stuff, as the rest of the reviews have pointed out.
The reason I finally got the complete set, even after getting many of the individual DVDs was it was cheaper to buy the whole set, getting all the DVDs, then it was getting the last three DVDs to complete my collection.  The advantage is the fact that the Complete Set costs less then most single DVDs.  The only sad part is the individual discs each came with a booklet of interviews and information.  And the Complete Set did not come with any extra material.  On the other hand it will take up less space than buying all seven discs.  But you only get one commentary no matter which way you collect the series.  In other words, the DVDs are the same, with all the same photo galleries, character profiles, and trailers.
So I had to drop a star.  When you put out a complete set it should have extras the other DVDs don't.  At least I think so.",1241654400,6,1292,4.3070539419087135
3418818,5,B0018RCN54,"This is has pretty much everything an anime fan could want.  Giant robots, sword fights, and guns aplenty.  But what makes this more than just another formulaic pile of junk is the excellent storyline and wonderful characters.  There is a reason there have been so many remakes of Kurosawa's masterpiece and this is one of the best out there.  This version makes the story its own, adding detail and nuances to the characters that set them apart from other versions.  While on the surface the characters could be seen as clichd, each one has a much deeper side that sets them apart.  When some die, you feel each loss.

The story is also seeped in traditional Japanese culture.  A great example of traditional Japanese morals and world-outlook that you can't find in most ""pulp"" anime today.

It also is an excellent example of traditional anime fused with newer animation techniques.  The two are joined so seamlessly, it can be hard to pinpoint when they switch.  The CG is well done and not over the top as in other releases.

There is enough here to keep those who just want action, mechs, and off-beat humor entertained, but, for those who enjoy Akira, Princess Mononoke, Ghost in the Shell, and the like (me for example), there is enough story and depth to keep us hooked as well.  I'm not saying it is on the same level as the aforementioned films, but it is definitely close.

This should be on the shelf of any anime fan.

The opening scene was pretty epic and set the tone.  The characters are very likable and I liked how the samurai got to know and respect each other throughout the course of the 26 episodes.

The music was very well done.  It reminded me of the original movie.  It has an old school feel to it.  I felt like I was transported to a different time. It gave me the sense that I was actually on the battlegrounds with the samurai all the way to being with the peasants in the rice patties.  Had a great deal of immersion.

I liked the nods it made to the original film. The story, for me, started off a bit slow.  It takes a little while before all the 7 samurai are assembled, but once all the pieces are set and put in motion, Samurai 7 tells a great tale of honor, sacrifice and duty.",1234828800,,911,4.096045197740113

3418822,5,B0018RCN54,"The anime genre, especially the giant robot subset

usually just bores me to tears.  The typical offering presents us with a bunch of girls blessed with unnaturally small waists and exaggeratedly large chests who team up with very feminine looking teenage boys to predictably blast some one-dimensional costumed bad guy (or girl) and his/her army of gobots into oblivion.

The only depth usually added to this is that one of the gender neutral Asian boys (usually with blonde hair and blue eyes of course) is a reluctant hero who hates authority and would be kicked out of any military worth a salt... except that he is SOOO talented the fate of the world (universe, clan, race) could be decided by his personal robot driving skill.  Of course one or more of the purple-haired heroines and often a costumed villain or two are madly in love with our hero leading him to a gripping (yawn) internal struggle over which one to date after, or during the utterly predictable fight.

This is not like that.

It's actually good and if you haven't seen the movie it's based off of or read the spoiler reviews it will often surprise you.  In any case after every episode I found myself saying 'well.. ok just one more it's only 20 minutes'.

3418823,5,B0018RCN54,"One of the greatest story tellers Akira Kurosawa is done justice with the retelling of one of his best works. 'Seven Smaurai' is the story of a villiage being enslaved by ruthless bandits forcing them to work the land in servitude. Their only hope is to venture out and find a band of Samurai. However, it is a process that will take much time because the Samurai are a dying breed not as honerable and noble as they were. Through much hardship and obstacles 7 worthy men are chosen by their pure hearts and honor and come together to wage a war on the bandits and reclaim their place in history and in the hearts of the innocent.

Enter 'Samurai 7' The story is re-told through the use of brilliant animation and set in a post apokalyptic future. The samurai have become common theives or sold their souls to become mighty steel machines to serve the imperial city. It's an incredible blend of classic Japanese story telling with a sci-fi twist. It's a specticle that makes all kind of emotions come out. It does move a little slow, but the character development as well as the story really sucks you making you wonder what will happen next.

'Samurai 7' has become a critically accalimed show by many critics and newspapers. It has become a cult classic in the anime mainstream and has even been broacsted on american television.

This was the first anime series I bought that I had never even watched an episode of before buying. And I am very glad that I took the chance, because this is one of the best anime series I have ever seen. The storyline is well-developed, the characters interesting, and the conclusion left me feeling fulfilled. The art is also top-notch. I can't comment about the English voice actors, but if you enjoy the Japanese seiyuu, then you'll get a treat from the voices of Romi Paku, Shinichiro Miki, Masaki Terasoma, Fumiko Orikasa, and Takehito Koyasu (just to name a few of the people on the fabulous cast).

Of course, this is the Viridian Collection, so please remember that. It's not the box set where ever disc is in an individual case, or where all of the special inserts come included. It's actually all 7 DVDs put into 5 cases in a smaller cardboard box. But if you don't mind that, then believe me, the buy is worth it.",1228176000,,1085,4.452261306532663

However, the series also delivers plenty of awkward and simply bad emotional exposition, several of the characters we've seen before (in every martial arts movie ever made), and the plot stretches a bit thin as the original 3 hour epic is expanded to 8 or 9 hours.

I was really impressed with the visual style of this series, and also with the overall plot and character development. The musical score was simple yet did its job to punctuate the action and highten the emotion, especially with traditional Japanese drums.

If you are a fan of the original let me just say that the story develops in a few different ways, so don't think of this as an animated version of the first live action film. It has its own story to tell, while taking the basics from Kurosawa.

In classic anime, this series has some over the top characters (namely in the the characters of the Merchants!). It also has some pretty impressive robotic samurai, which gives a cool modern twist to its period setting.

I would definately recommend buying this particular set (the Viridian Collection) at its great price. The original boxed set artwork remains with the packaging, inside the slim cases.",1227398400,,990,4.744186046511628

The fight sceens are very detailed and so fast that you'd have to watch them in slow-mo to truly appreciate the detail. It has a good story line and you'll love all of the characters.
 This series takes place in a futuristic world that's just suffered through a massive war. All the villages are controlled or terrorized by the Nobuseri bandits. These men were once Samurai but chose to become machines in order to be more powerful. All the villages are suffering. The villagers are starving because the Nobuseri are taking all the rice they grow; though some villagers tried to rebel against this injustice they were too weak and paid dearly.
 But one village has no other choice but to try and resist the Nobuseri or they will surely parish. The elder decides the only way they'll have a chance is to hire 7 strong samurai to help them. The village sends it's water priestess, Kirara, to find these men and bring them to the village.

There are many adventures and quite a bit of intrigue in the royal merchant court. Only by watching this series from start to finish will you discover how and if these samurai can save the village.
