8306360,5,B001GNSNUE,I use this DVD in my Criminal Justice class at our vocational school when I am teaching access control.  It is a good primer on what kind of locks to buy to try to stop someone from breaking in.  I wouldn't recommend it if you have potential thieves in class.  It opens your eyes to how easy it is to defeat some locks.,1390521600,,319,4.031746031746032
