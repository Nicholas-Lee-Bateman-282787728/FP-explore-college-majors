4018063,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I found this on Comcast's On Demand line up.  It was a 30 minute sample.
I LOVED IT!  I LOVE CHERYL BURKE!  :)

This workout really reminded my of aerobics classes from the late 70's.  I found the moves easy to learn.  I had to modify because I am so out of shape, but it was easy to do.  Cheryl starts the moves as basic moves and then bumps them up a notch at a time.  She leads you through a short routine move-by-move, and then at the end she puts all of the routines together.
Even though there were times I would miss a step here and there it kept me moving and did not slow the workout for me.
The dancers behind her had fun with the dancing and made it even more enjoyable.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheryl-Burke-Presents-Disco-Abs-3-DVD/dp/B002ZFEQNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheryl Burke Presents Disco Abs (3 DVD)</a>",1262390400,19,873,4.972413793103448
4018064,2,B002ZFEQNU,"I tried out the ""Disco Abs"" routine by Cheryl Burke on Exercise TV, which I assume is part of this DVD package. I was disappointed in the program, although it looked to be fun at the start, at least for the music (which I DID enjoy). However, from a workout point-of-view this program didn't do it for me. I like aerobics routines where the moves are simple to learn and follow, and don't require advanced ability and comfort with fancy dance choreography. Unfortunately, as a result this program turned out to be pretty much everything I DISLIKE as a result. I was quickly lost by the dance moves even after multiple viewings and attempts to pick them up. As a result I spent more time trying to catch up with the moves than burning calories. Maybe the full DVD package has more of a warm-up or basic guide to the moves?

I feel like this might be a good workout for those already familiar with disco dancing and enjoy it, but for the rest of us? Not so much.",1261267200,2,960,4.363128491620111
4018115,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I have been on a dance exercise DVD kick lately and have bought about 20 different ones. Some suck,most are ok, and there are one or two that are great. This one is phenomenal, and my absolute favorite.
  If you have no dance background and cannot pick up simple choreography as it is being danced, then don't buy this. You will feel confused, and probably get frustrated. Otherwise.....
I LOVED the little timer at the bottom counting down the minutes. I LOVED the music! No more quasi-elevator music dance DVD's! I LOVED the super high energy level....everyone seemed to be bursting with energy,but not in an annoying way. I LOVED the moves...they were funky and fun. I LOVED the workout. It manages to pack a lot into thirty minutes. I LOVED that the music was loud enough so that I could hear it. I LOVED LOVED LOVED this DVD!
  If you like dance exercise DVD's then BUY THIS!
I also wanted to say that all the reviews saying the couple behind Cheryl were annoying made me almost not buy it. When I did buy it anyway I braced myself for the worst, but couldn't see at all what they were talking about. They just looked like they were having a great time. This is DANCING and you are supposed to put your personality into it. I was glad to see them get into it and for me it added to the fun of the DVD.",1344556800,2,1306,4.318367346938776
4018116,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I am a Zumba Instructor and Personal Trainer and I LOVE this workout.  I'm 48, so the music is from my era and I loved disco dancing back in the day. I believe that this is a good workout, but not extremely difficult.  I've read the negative reviews and here's my take on them. This ""ab"" workout is a ""standing"" ab workout. Ladies, please do not think that you must be lying on the floor to get an ab workout. You'll never have great abs anyway unless you are eating a clean diet. Doing long ab workouts on the floor are no more beneficial and you cannot spot reduce either and most people end up hurting their necks and backs with floor ab work. I always incorporate standing ab work in my classes.  As far as her cueing, it could be better. I believe every workout DVD should have a ""technique"" section to show people proper form on squats and lunges.  If you don't know proper form, please research it. There are many good videos on the internet with certified trainers showing you the correct form. Most of the steps are not difficult, example: 4 steps forward, tap, 4 steps back, tap, repeat to the side, etc. I think what most people find challenging is adding the hand movements.  If the hands throw you off, do the footwork first, then add the hands later.  Most of my clientele is around my age+ and I have done many of these moves with them and they did great and were able to follow along. It's not high impact, but it's challenging and it's not hard on the knees. As far as the songs, there are original songs, but on some of the workouts there are also instrumental disco tunes in between the original songs.  What people have to understand is the producers of the DVD must pay dearly for the rights to use these songs. If they use too many, they have to raise the price of the DVD. So, they are just trying to keep costs down. There are slower songs that you can start with (e.g. The Beginner Hustle) and work your way to the faster ones. One reviewer said they were disappointed by boring squats and lunges. Well, unfortunately, those are the BEST compound exercises for your legs. The way they are done in this workout makes them more fun. You can't please everyone all the time, so some will think this is too easy and some too difficult. I have been teaching fitness for many years to people with 2 left feet (their words, not mine), bad backs and bad knees, and they are able to do this type of workout. But you have to stick with it and you may not get it the first few times around, but persevere!!",1341273600,8,2519,4.312896405919662
4018117,3,B002ZFEQNU,"I tried this video but I felt I was not getting a good workout because I could not keep up to the steps.  Maybe if Cheryl stated what the next steps was going to be or slowed it down a little, it would be easier to follow.  Since I am older (fifty-ish) this may have something to do with me keeping up.",1323388800,,302,3.8548387096774195
4018118,1,B002ZFEQNU,This video was disappointing. It started out too fast and it was hard to keep up. I thought it would be primarily for abs. but it wasn't. I only viewed it once and put it away. I plan to sell it at my next garage sale. Should have purchased a better video for abs.,1318982400,,264,3.9074074074074074
4018119,4,B002ZFEQNU,"I grew up in the disco era so the music is fun and the moves are familiar. I LOVE Cheryl Burke and her nature...she is just pleasant to work out with. There is a couple that works out behind her that annoy me to no end. It is as if they are trying to ""out sexy"" each other and they end up looking really ridiculous. I think I would have given the series a 5 had they not been in the video...who wants to be annoyed for 30 minutes every morning!

Cheryl Burke is the draw...the ladies on the podiums in the far back are fine...that couple in the middle? YUK.

The workouts are fun...

**Two weeks into using the dvd set**
I still enjoy the workout and have got a feel of the different steps in each work out. I alternate the dvd's each day. It is a good work out and I enjoy it a lot. I would prefer the couple in the middle not be there at all, they still annoy me but I just try to focus on Cheryl and the other two ladies for instruction.",1316476800,,940,3.9368421052631577
4018120,4,B002ZFEQNU,This DVD is lots of fun! I 1st came across it on my TV (On Demand - Exercise TV). her exercises are very easy & lots of fun!,1308960000,,124,3.4642857142857144
4018121,4,B002ZFEQNU,"This is the first exercise dvd i ever bought, and although I own several, it's the one I come back to the most.  The workouts are easy to do, and with 5 workouts to pick from I can mix it up and do something different every day without getting bored.  The routines vary in length from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and also includes a Beginner workout with easier exercises.  I like that she uses real disco hits instead of tacky ""soundalikes""; however, some workouts use instrumental dance-techno music instead.  There's also a countdown clock that I find helpful as well. Some of the reviewers here have mentioned that Cheryl's cueing isn't the best and I have to agree- sometimes if I'm not watching carefully I fall behind for a moment or get mixed up with what I'm doing.  But- her enthusiasm and excitement makes up for it and I always find myself having a good time when I'm working out to this dvd.",1304467200,,901,4.469512195121951
4018122,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I would diffenately recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to get up a move and have fun, the steps are very easy to follow and you burn alot of calories, this DVD is diff in my work out rotation....",1302134400,,197,4.076923076923077
4018123,5,B002ZFEQNU,This is a fun and quick way to get a great workout.  There is a lot of variety in the five disks to change the length and vary the routine.,1301875200,,139,3.6333333333333333
4018124,2,B002ZFEQNU,"Cheryl is an enthusiastic motivator, and looks terrific on the package and doing the moves in the video.  Unfortunately, that's where her merits as a workout instructor end.  I prefer my instructor to cue me for the next move a few beats ahead so that I know what to expect... but Cheryl doesn't seem to even know herself.  As a result, most of her cues during the workouts are limited to ""Keep going!"" and ""One more time!""  What's more, she often sounds like she's out of breath! And her own movements seem stiff and limited compared to one of the bouncy, enthusiastic background dancers.

The choreography on these discs is indeed fun -- and effective! -- but extremely repetitive.  Each move is fun at first, but seems to last several reps longer than necessary or interesting.  For me that adds up to boring, especially when the promised ""full songs by the original artists"" end and we are left with silence but for the stomping of the dancers' feet.  This, coupled with the instructor's apparent lack of familiarity with the workout, gives the whole thing a sort of unfinished, hastily produced quality.

And finally, the buns and thighs workout -- which the box promises contains ""no boring squats or lunges!"" -- consists ENTIRELY of... boring squats and lunges.

The countdown clock is a nice feature, but not enough to keep me coming back.
I'll definitely continue to favor my Crunch workouts over this one.",1299542400,8,1415,4.7860082304526745
4018135,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I am not one of those people who love to exercise, but I want to lose weight so it's a necessary evil.  This DVD set is fantastic.  I actually enjoyed doing the routines and I sweated a lot so I knew I was working my body (besides being out of breath at times).  The music is fun and upbeat and encourages you to move.

The first DVD has a 30 minute cardio routine and a 5 minute ab routine.  DVD number 2 has a 30 minute cardio routine and a 12 minute ab routine.  DVD 3 has a 20 minute buns and thighs routine.

For me, DVD 3 was the hardest.  My legs really burned.  Maybe it was because I did it after the 12 minute ab routine.  I don't know.  Next time I'll do that routine first.

I've only done each routine once, but I plan to do them again.  My body ached the next day because I had used muscles other exercise routines didn't.

Cheryl does a good job with the cuing and explaining.  I think I did okay with the steps.  I have room to improve and that will come with doing the routines again.

Cheryl has four people behind her also doing the routines.  The guy and gal directly behind her are annoying and I raised my eyebrows at some of their joint interaction and wanted to say, ""Get a room!""  I wonder what Cheryl thought when she saw the playback.  I also wonder why they didn't reshoot it and tell those two to cool it.  It would be better without them, but that's minor.

I totally recommend this set and I look forward to getting Disco Abs!",1294272000,5,1457,4.092198581560283
4018136,5,B002ZFEQNU,"This is an awesome workout video and the music played during it is GREAT - brings back a lot of wonderful memories.  I was really excited when I ordered it and couldn't wait until it came. I had been doing other types of workouts which I thought were good but oh boy, when I tried this for the first time - what a difference.  It is what I call a ""true workout"" video and I am so glad I ordered it.",1294012800,2,398,3.9012345679012346
4018137,3,B002ZFEQNU,"I started doing this workout as a part of Time Warner Cable's exercise on demand. The dance routines are so fun that I find myself forgeting that I'm exercising, so I bought the DVD set. And so far it's kind of a let down. The other workouts in the set are not as challenging as the one on TWC. If I had to do it again I would not buy the set, and continue to do the free one on cable. And the ""ab"" work outs are a joke; one of them is only five minutes long. Long story short, if you're a regular exerciser and in good shape spend your money on something else.",1284681600,,561,3.8869565217391306
4018138,4,B002ZFEQNU,"This dvd is for people who hate to workout. This dvd is so much fun it doesn't seem like a workout. The dances are easy to learn, and the music is great if you like old school disco. I only wish she would do a disco abs 2.",1282003200,,222,3.6458333333333335
4018139,1,B002ZFEQNU,I was very unhappy with the product as I had to send it back the first time due to the DVD skipping. Then I recieved another one from the vendor and the sound cut out with eight minutes left. I like the DVD itself it is a good workout and you will lose weight  but I will continue to watch it on TV rather than buy another one through Amazon. If you are going to purchase one do not purchase through Sarah's Music. The vendor was less than polite when I emailed the second time about the problem and wanted a refund.,1276041600,2,516,4.0588235294117645
4018140,5,B002ZFEQNU,"the only thing i wish i was committed to exercise which is totally not Cheryl Burke's fault. she explain the step very well. very easy to follow, even i could do it and i haven't dance on over a year. Great product!",1274918400,,215,4.142857142857143
4018141,5,B002ZFEQNU,"Like some of the previous reviewers, I tried one of these 30-min workouts on Exercise TV.  I have heard a lot of criticism of the other DWTS workout videos because they are too challenging and hard to follow.  I really like Cheryl and I love Disco so I was very excited to try this one out.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It was a great workout!  It was very easy to follow, with maybe a few times where I didn't get the step exactly right but it didn't affect the overall workout at all.  You are moving the whole time and it does a great job of keeping your heart rate up.  I was definitely sweating without dying.  It was low impact cardio.  I LOVED the moves she chose!  They were basic enough to master easily but she threw on extras that made it really fun.  There were some great ""feel sexy"" moves and ab moves.  I hate when dance moves are too ""dance-y"" and don't let you really get into it because you are focusing so hard on getting the moves right.  I also don't like when they move too fast and you rush through everything.  This workout had none of that!  It was just right with the moves and intensity.  I was really, really impressed.  I really want to try out the other workouts on her dvds so I think I will end up buying the disc set.  I am very reserved with my $ so this says a lot.  Try it on ExerciseTV if you can to see if you like her style.  For me, it was exactly what I want in a dance workout - great cardio, fun moves, easy to follow, great music, good energy, no dread-factor, and a fantastic instructor!  Cheryl Burke was amazing - perfect demeanor that is motivating, encouraging, and fun, without being too over-the-top or too drill-sergeant like.  Her enthusiasm kept my energy up.  I can't recommend this enough!",1270339200,,1746,4.27217125382263
4018142,4,B002ZFEQNU,"also found on comcast on demand and love it! wish I could view more of the other discs...sorry but, I disagree with the other reviewer who said you need to know how to dance.  I can't dance to save my life but, the moves are pretty simple/basic and keep your heartrate up-what could be better than that?!  and it's fun!  I will probably order this dvd set.",1269648000,3,356,4.2835820895522385
4018143,5,B002ZFEQNU,"I've been struggling with losing my maternity weight for months, and have tried several DVDs (postnatal workouts, yoga, cardio, kickboxing, pilates, circuit training). Hands down, Cheryl's 3 disc workout is the BEST! I used to be an avid dancer, and I'm usually bored out of my mind with slow warm-ups, workouts taking forever to make me break a sweat, or with the dances being comprised of simplistic, un-challenging steps. This workout is fun (no exaggeration), has the original music (not those weird Muzak versions of the songs), and actually made me feel my abs working hard enough to start getting tight again. I've only been using the workouts for two weeks, and my body is starting to firm up more, my posture is getting better, and my stomach is finally getting smaller. Hallelujah!

I always enjoyed Cheryl on DWTS, as the healthiest-looking professional dancer there (lean and toned, but still curvy). She is refreshingly direct with the workout guidance, and doesn't make any cheesy jokes or unnecessary chatter. She's adorable and inspiring. I would totally recommend these DVDs!",1268438400,19,1092,5.134831460674158

8384755,3,B002ZFEQNU,"Because I love Cheryl Burke on DWTS, I thought she would put together a good dancing exercise video that I could incorporate into my effort to get back to regular exercising and put together a mixture of fun videos.  However, although I consider myself to be a relatively good dancer and, for sure, coordinated, after trying every one of these discs, I was totally defeated!!!  Besides moving at such a fast pace, Cheryl doesn't provide much, if any, guidance along the way.  Obviously, she and all the dancers behind her know what they're going to do next and look great doing it, BUT ... they move from one sequence to another incredibly fast & without any warning as to what's coming next!

I am an experienced exerciser and this is one of my favorite videos - I even ordered another copy of this for my sister as a gift. Cheryl starts out every part slowly so you can catch the steps which are not complicated. I have a video where the steps are so fast and complicated that I can't do them so I know what I am talking about when I say ""not complicated"". Remember that if some moves on any video are not for you, you can always march or run in place. The idea is to keep moving, and these videos will keep you moving!
