2005647,4,B0001JSRF0,"This 1996 movie is about a simple  deaf/mute couple (Nana Patekar & Seema Biswas) who live by the sea in Goa. They are very dependent on their daughter (Manisha Koirala) who has normal functioning, to be their voice and communicate to the world. There is also a grandmother who loves music and teaches the girl to play piano and develop her singing (that is till grannie dies ). So the story is above the joy of sound and music and all the subtleties of understanding of those living in a world without sound - and the dilemmas this brings for their child wanting ot have a life of her own. Of course daughter falls mutually in love with a caring composer/musician (Salman Khan) who helps her release an album with him- though her father disapproves of any liaison that could take the daughter from her role with them.
The script is particularly good and the actors put in strong performances (inclusing Manisha looking a lot more cheerful than I've generally seen her elsewhere, and a sensitive Salman Khan). For me the music (with the exception of one song which I liked) was not particularly memorable but was fine. The cinematography is also beautiful. It was a movie that left me thoughtful after the images faded and I always credit that.  It wasn't the most involving Bollywood I've seen but it is a movie that focuses on disabled issues as well as the value of our senses and music, with sensitivity.  There were times I found it inspirational but at others felt weighed down by the challenges such people face. It may require a little more patience than usual too. It could be a little slow in places when there are speeches by the mute involving sign language translation and these slowed the pace at times.
Elsewhere on the `Net it tends to score above average (e.g. averaging 7.4 out of 10 on IMDb) and almost no one puts it below average though some give it full marks.",1247011200,,1882,4.578635014836795
8013207,5,B0001JSRF0,"In this award-winning drama, Annie (Manisha Koirala) is the hearing daughter of a deaf couple, and finds herself divided between two worlds.  When Raj (Salman Khan) arrives bringing romance and music, her life takes a new direction, and she is torn between her new love for Raj and her duty towards her parents.

This is poignant and heartwarming film, with a strong message of faith and family.  Some of the songs are particularly lovely.  While both Koirala and Khan were good in their roles, the supporting cast of Helen, Nana Patekar, and Seema Biswas were fantastic.  I highly recommend this lovely movie.",1490832000,,610,4.9411764705882355
8013208,5,B0001JSRF0,"Absolutely amazing movie one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen though not the typical storyline no as others have said . It didn't have a really uppity happy storyline that most have but I loved that about it . It had such heartfelt emotions all the way through between parents and their children especially the father and daughter . Nana Pattaker is always a delight in any role and this could be his masterpiece . That was the biggest storyline . What his little girl meant to him she was his ears . This was such a beautiful movie . It had such beautiful music in it all the way through .
Salman Kahn is in the movie in lots of parts in a great role at least to me always showing his faith and his love and kindness for others as he does in real life so it was just truly beautiful .

As for my amazing seller Planet Bollywood I want to highly recommend the company I purchase my dvds through . They are amazingly great at getting your dvds to you very fast and wrapped very protectively and I trust them with my orders . They have excellent customer service and for that there are not enough stars . Please use them for your Hindi movie purchases . Thank you .",1483315200,,1169,4.195555555555556
8013209,5,B0001JSRF0,"I like it a lot!!!!!! Full of intense emotions, the love between a pair of deaf mute parents for their daughter, and the love of the daughter for her parents. And of course the love of this boy, that placed her in a difficult position at see herself with a heart divided with two different kinds of loves, and with the knowledge that any decision she take will affect the life of each other, forever.",1411948800,,400,4.346666666666667
8013210,3,B0001JSRF0,"I expected more Salman Khan because his picture features on the cover, but his role is very marginal. Nana Patekar was the key male figure and did a really good job as the girl's deaf father. It is kind of a harsh story as the family must survive with two handicapped parents raising their children and suffering tragedy as well as hardship. And there is premarital sex (implied), which surprised me. But everyone did a good job with their parts. Not all sunshine and roses. This is a serious story with some harsh moments. I tend to prefer somewhat lighter fare, thus the 3 stars.",1407715200,,581,4.542857142857143
8013211,4,B0001JSRF0,"This is a sensitive movie (actually a musical) about a deaf and mute couple living in Goa, India. Life is difficult for them in a world of sound. This is about their struggles (which are difficult to watch at times), their personal stigma, their loss of faith in God when their son dies of an accident, their co-dependency with their daughter (who has normal hearing) as their voice to the world, and hostility when she discovers her natural gift (music), falls in love and they are about to lose her (and their contact with the world). To complicate things the girl is Catholic and the boy is Hindu, there is the parental shame of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and a near fatal accident of the daughter. But all is resolved at the end.",1406505600,,732,4.595419847328245
8013212,1,B0001JSRF0,"This movie is a good movie - very moving and moody. However, the DVD by Moser Bauer is terrible. The print is horrible - it looks like it was taken straight off a highly compressed VCD source. Most scenes are soft. The words 'Moser Bauer' appear as a watermark on the top left corner of the picture throughout the movie. The DVD includes a 5 minute commercial about Moser Bauer at the beginning before the menu - this commercial can't be skipped. In other words - don't buy this DVD! Borrow it from a friend or rent it from somewhere but do not give Moser Bauer your money for putting out such a crappy release.",1393804800,,611,4.321739130434783
8013213,5,B0001JSRF0,"This movie depicted the story of the hard, but loving life of a couple who is deaf, but have hearing children and their everyday struggles to lead ""normal"" lives. There were many, very, tender scenes, both involving the main and sub-plots. Great music. Wonderful acting. I highly recommend this movie.",1363046400,,301,5.04

8013215,5,B0001JSRF0,One of the true Bollywood classic which is a must-watch! I won't go into the plot etc but the fabulous performances from the entire cast particularly Manisha Koirala and Salman Khan were so enjoyable to watch. It's a touching story which is both heart warming as well as heart wrenching at times - brought me a few tears in certain scenes! The songs were rather forgetable except for one outstanding number and there were just too many songs which were a bit of a drag sometimes but overall this movie is highly recommended.,1313366400,2,524,4.645161290322581
8013216,5,B0001JSRF0,"This is one of the best films ever made. The setting of Goa was a wonderful choice because it is a fresh, welcome change from the majority of Hindi films. Most of the music was enjoyable; very catchy, sweet, melodic, and nicely incorporated into the plot. It was realistic in terms of the way the characters dressed, reacted, the hardships they faced, their rejoicing, and their surroundings. I was able to relate to the normalcy of the atmosphere of the film. The storyline revolves around mute and deaf parents who have a child, Annie, that serves as their link to the world of the hearing and speaking. The parents had great chemistry and talent and were very well cast in their role. Manisha Koirala delivers a phenomenal performance in her portrayal of Annie. Her character possesses a wonderful singing voice and strong devotion to her parents . Her grandmother Mariam, played by dancing star of yesteryear Helen, exposed her to the world of music and encouraged her talent. She is an artistic, lively, fun-loving lady. It was a pleasure seeing her in this role. Salman Khan's character, Raj, played Annie's romantic interest. Raj is also a music director and is both humorous and endearing. He was perfect for this role. The relationship between the characters is captivating, heart-warming, believable, and very realistic with a touch of Hindi film sparkle. Highly recommended.",1295568000,4,1385,5.0
