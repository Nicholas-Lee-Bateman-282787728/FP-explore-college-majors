7903104,5,B000003KAX,"It is ""pon farr"" time in the ""Star Trek"" universe once again with ""Blood Fever"" (Written by Lisa Klink, Aired February 5, 1997), Episode 57 of ""Star Trek: Voyager.""  However, the afflicted Vulcan is not Tuvok, but an ensign named Vorik who's warped logical mind decides that he should asked Torres (Roxann Dawson) to be his mate.  She rejects his overture, not only with a polite refusal but also by dislocating his jaw when he grabs her face.  For those few souls who missed ""Amok Time"" on the original ""Star Trek,"" the Doctor (Robert Picardo) explains that Vorik can die is he does not mate.  While Vorik endeavors to get through this trying time through intense meditation, Torres joins an Away Team searching for gallicite on the planet below. The only problem is that her Klingon side seems to be making its presence known as she become more and more aggressive, even biting Paris at one point.
Of course when Vorik touched Torres' face that was enough to initiate a telepathic mating bond between them, which means now she is experiencing ""pon farr"" as well.  Meanwhile, back on ""Voyager"" the Doctor has programmed a holographic Vulcan female for Vorik (which pretty much confirms what you suspected about Quark's holosuites on DS9).  However, it is down on the planet where Torres is making the moves on Paris that things are getting interesting, especially for those who know where that relationship is going to end and what happens in the final episode of the series.  Consequently, ""Blood Fever"" is a important story in terms of the entire series since it is in many ways the first significant Torres-Paris episode.
There are also some aliens on the planet who have had some major problems in what will also become a major subplot down the road, but this episode is primarily about this pon farr a trois.  Just like in the original ""Star Trek"" show, this one comes down to a fight.  Consequently, ""Blood Fever"" manages to do something of a homage to the original episode but ground it entirely in the context of this series and its characters.  This is not a classic ""Voyager"" episode per se, but it is an important one in terms of what is to come.",1066694400,,2158,4.70026525198939
7903105,5,B000003KAX,"If you are a true Voyager fan, this is an episode you should not miss, I own it.  It shows us all how the real relationship between Torres and Paris begin...but does so with humor and in true Klingon form...a ritual of sorts.  Paris is not sure what hits him, but knows he wants more, thus the relationship truly begins.  A great video.  Paris and TOrres are perfect together.  Don't miss this one!",1036886400,2,398,4.397260273972603
