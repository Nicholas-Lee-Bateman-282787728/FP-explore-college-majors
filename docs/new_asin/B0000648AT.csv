7960785,5,B0000648AT,"DIRECTOR'S CUTS of our NEW VALUE PACKED - 2 FOR 1 COMBO ZEN DVD with slight name change is now avaiable as:  Vols (2+4) HAWAII ZEN: Meditation with Nature / WAVES Virtual Vacations + Vol 4 Californian Zen (SIDE 2). SEARCH 'HAWAII ZEN' not ""Hawaiian Zen"" to find it here on Amazon.com.

The New Directors cuts of both Vols 2 and 4, have restored the original footage with sharper images, and better color.  The graphics and logos have been completely removed between the day segments thanks to customer feedback.

Lastly, these Zen Titles are the Yang or darker side of the Waves Series.  If you want only happy, sunny shots of Hawaii and California, then buy Vols 1 HAWAIIAN DREAMS and Vols (11+3) CALIFORNIA + VOL 3. CALIFORNIAN DREAMS.  However, if you want the quiet, foggy, north shores of Hawaii with lapping waves, or bigger stormier surf, night shots, surreal artsy shots, then check out this great value ZEN DVD combo!",1154217600,3,926,4.720496894409938
7960786,1,B0000648AT,"I've four different DVD's from Waves, and they are good! Really good!

This one is terrible. First of all, it's boring.

Introduction is forever; breaks between segments (or days) are even longer. Beaches are my second problem with this DVD - where they came from? Is this what Hawaii is all about? Lake Helen in Wisconsin looks better.",1148774400,,336,4.775862068965517
7960787,5,B0000648AT,So enjoyable and relaxing you'll want to float off to sleep but you want to stay alert to watch and hear the next scene!,1143158400,,120,4.041666666666667
7960788,5,B0000648AT,"This is my favorite of the Waves DVD's, unlike ""Hawaiian Dreams"" which is mostly sunny paradise shots, this ""Hawaiian Zen"" takes a closer look at the quieter Northern sides of the islands, that are usually in the fog and tropical rain forests, unseen by most tourists.  Many of the day segments begin with a calm, Zen shot of water lapping the rocks like a Japanese garden. Although some shots begin this way , they all include many sunny shots with brilliant blue skies and end with a colorful sunset capturing the aloha spirit with waving palm trees and pink skies. Each shot lasts a minute or two allowing one to relax and enjoy this unusual trip.
For one disappointed reviewer to say that this DVD is all foggy, with no colors is a ridiculous exaggeration. He should have bought Hawaiian Dreams instead. My favorite shots remind me of a Zen painting with white skies and lapping waves surrounding black zen rocks. There are 3 beautiful waterfall shots as well as 6 glamorous Hawaiian sunsets from black volcanic rocks against red skies to lapping waves underneath pink clouds. This DVD shows the wonderful diversity of Hawaii - not just the sunny beaches... but also the quieter and pristine sides of the islands.  I would definitely recommend this DVD for the nature lover, who has a Zen spirit.",1074643200,9,1300,4.747787610619469
7960789,1,B0000648AT,"This is really bad! My Wife and I have lived on, or vacationed on, all of the main Hawaii islands, and we could not believe this had been filmed here.
1. Most of the scenes are of sand and waves that could have been shot anywhere, Santa Monica, Long Beach, South Padre Island, anywhere but Hawaii.
2. The colors are washed out, giving the film a dull and drab appearance!
3. Most of the scenes are overcast, misty, or foggy! No bright brilliant blue sky here.
4. At the start and end of each segment you get these really annoying graphics and adds for their web sight.
Get ""Bay Watch- Hawaiian Weddings"" and you'll get more of a Hawaii experience!!!",1072137600,10,649,4.416666666666667
7960790,4,B0000648AT,"This is an amazing DVD.  It's a perfect background for quiet conversation.  To  say that it is soothing and calming is an understatement.  It just takes the edge off the day.  There is a  moonlit scene that is particularly breathtaking.  A few minutes of this DVD is  all I need to let go of petty frustrations.
On a big screen tv, I needed to adjust the brightness, contrast, color, tint,  and sharpness settings; set the color temperature on warm; and watch it on a  full screen setting.  The sound quality is acceptable.  The DVD would have been  even more stunning shot in widescreen format with high definition cameras.
The DVD is divided into 6 days with different views.  They put a little blerb at  the end of each ""day"" that contains two trademarks and a web address.  There  are six days, so it shows this six times throughout.  It hints of advertisement and I found  it a little disruptive in the middle of an otherwise awesome DVD.  Even so, I recommend it as a way to relax any time of the day.",1069459200,12,1007,4.428571428571429
7960791,4,B0000648AT,"Just as relaxing as you'd think it would be. I bought this for my mom, who loves just sitting and staring at the waves when we go to the beach, and she enjoyed it very much. The scenery is gorgeous, and switches to show four different beaches.",1040860800,2,243,4.191489361702128
7960792,5,B0000648AT,"This wave series has it all. Lapping waves,large waves,waterfalls rainforest mountains and birds. Day one starts with a calm ocean and birds chirpping with waves in the distance. Every once in a while a wavelette occasionally goes around a rock. Day 1 ends with some very large waves the biggest I've seen in the waves series and a surfer riding them. Day 2 starts with a waterfall in the rainforest with birds chirpping. On shot 2it returns back to the ocean with lapping waves and mist. Day 3On shot 5 or 6 their's a beautiful night seen under the moonlight with waves lapping. Day 4 has huge waves toward sunset. And another night seen shows lapping waves on the beach under the moonlight toward the end. Day 5 has some huge waves on shot 3 and also some lapping waves on other shots. Day 6 starts with 5 very beautiful waterfalls running down a mountain and ends with the ocean again. This is a quiter zenlike vacation than the other 3 but because ofthe Waterfalls and occasinal large waves I love this one. The sound and beauty of these waterfalls is so peaceful and serene on dvd. Dvd features are chapter search,previews of the other vacation series,and loop play. If you like ocean waves,waterfalls,rainforest,birds and mountains this is the dvd for you. I highly recommend Hawaiian zen along with Hawaiian dreams,California dreams and California zen.",1020038400,11,1359,4.787234042553192
7960793,5,B0000648AT,"Did you ever want your own place of peaceful solitude?  This video takes you to zen like places. In a peaceful mist, water calmly laps onto the shore and flows around rocks creating ripples of interest. Birds chirp as waterfalls flow through a lush tropical garden. Great for meditation and peaceful reflection. A piece of  art!",983577600,9,328,4.839285714285714
