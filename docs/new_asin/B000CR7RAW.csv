8100901,4,B000CR7RAW,"Good for Benchley fans. Not necessarily the best of his work, but a good selection.  Maybe the larger more expensive collection is better, but it does cost more.  The oldest ones are interesting from a historical perspective, if not very impressive.",1384473600,,249,5.048780487804878
8100902,3,B000CR7RAW,"For most of us Robert Benchley is most famous for being grandfather to Peter Benchley author of Jaws among other best-selling novels. The reason why his grandfather's name is typically mentioned in Peter Benchley biographies is that Robert was a very successful writer, actor, and producer of many film shorts. This DVD is a collection of Benchley shorts with the addition of some starring fellow Algonquin Round Table habitus Alexander Wolcott and Donald Ogden Stewart.

While Robert Benchley was a very successful humorist I found him less acidic than James Thurber and less skilled at improbable wordplay than PG Wodehouse. I have not seen many of his other film shorts and will defer to the reviewers who've indicated that that this collection does not include the best of Robert Benchley.
That said these pieces range from the mildly pleasant to the genuinely humorous. Once again I recommend this unusual DVD as much for its historic value as for its absolute entertainment value. Perhaps the highlight of this DVD as a historic document is the 1928 Benchley production of The Treasurers Report. This is a talking film dating from four months after the very first one: The Jazz Singer. As a piece of humor it's good for a few smiles. Perhaps the best video sketch is the one entitled Crime Control in which Benchley wears a police captain's uniform and demonstrates the universally acknowledged criminal intentions of a class of objects known as inanimate.

The sketch pieces the Forgotten Man, the Trouble with Husbands, and The Man's Angle were no doubt thought original and clever in their day but are so dated as to constitute a view into in America long gone and whose passage is likely not regretted. All of these sketches are clever they just reflect a world that is difficult to imagine.

Speaking to the technical issues of this DVD; it is perhaps better than can reasonably be expected. These are very old films it is unlikely that the original copies had been given the best of treatment and transfer to DVD can rarely improve on deteriorated film stock. That said the audio is no grainier then the original movie house audience would've experienced and unless you are exceptionally attuned to this sort of thing the wide variation in visual quality is rarely distracting.
The most likely market for this DVD are fans of Robert Benchley, those with an interest in seeing honored members of the famous Algonquin Roundtable, and folks with an abiding interest in the earliest years of filmmaking. The more general viewer is likely to enjoy this is a one-time rental. This DVD is a pleasant hour or so of very light entertainment you should find yourself smiling and on occasion chuckling.",1379808000,2,2703,4.910284463894967
8100903,3,B000CR7RAW,"For die-hard Robert Benchley lovers, this is a must-own even if the visual quality of the shorts leaves much to be desired. They don't seem to have been restored or remastered and look faded and grainy. It's great to have them, nonetheless, and while Benchley's understated humor now seems a little muted, his charming manner and his little throwaway gestures, expressions and delivery are still fun, even if the comedy lacks its original impact. The pieces are amusing if not always laugh-out-loud funny, probably because so many of his ideas have by now been imitated and become comic cliches in the intervening 68 years. These are definitely relics but well worth watching anyway.",1267833600,4,683,5.053097345132743
8100904,4,B000CR7RAW,"I first reviewed this title when it was released on VHS, and wasn't totally impressed with the quality or selection of the shorts contained in it.  I thought it would be good to have the DVD version though, despite my qualms.  I was surprised to find that the DVD contains five additional Benchley Paramount shorts, giving us all nine of the shorts that Benchley made for Paramount from 1940 to 1942.  In my previous review, I said that some of the titles were from reissue prints and so lacked the original titles.  Kino seems to have found original prints with the original titles (with one exception), and has replaced them for the DVD.  The print quality of the shorts is generally good, not perfect, but not terrible either.  I own 16mm prints of many of the shorts, so for example, it was good to see a better print of KEEPING IN SHAPE than I already own.  Recommended for those who would like to see all of his Paramount shorts.",1211155200,13,935,4.497041420118343
8100905,5,B000CR7RAW,"Okay, the picture quality may not be pristine, but considering the rarity of the prints, it is more than passable.  The previous reviewer should have been around 60 years ago to bitch and complain enough to make the brain-dead exectutives at Paramount take better care of their film library.  They didn't, and as a result, all we have of these classic Benchley efforts are second and third generation prints, of which the digital transfer emphasizes every little flaw.  As for the shorts themselves, they may not be on par with the best of Benchley's efforts at MGM, but they are stil imaginative and enjoyable.  Also enjoyable are the three shorts featuring Alexander Woollcott and Donald Ogden Stewart.  All told, this is an excellent DVD package that improves upon its previous VHS incarnation.  Now, if only MGM would get on the ball, and release a collection of their Benchley shorts, as opposed to releasing them piece-meal as extra features on other DVDs.  Here's hoping.",1161734400,27,978,4.96319018404908
8100906,1,B000CR7RAW,"I love Robert Benchley shorts as seen on TCM; they are so clean and crisp in picture quality and I expected the same in this expensive Paramount collection.  Instead, each short is more faded than the cheapest Alpha video.  I've never been more disappointed and would return them for a refund if possible.",1154649600,27,305,4.735849056603773
