8616388,2,B00FKN1S9O,"Video of a few Schooners ghosting around in circles, in fog, in a bay. No clear pictures of the ships sailing. It is a little boring as it is the same boats just going around in the same place with only a few sails flying. The fog makes the video unclear. The picture on the cover is the only clear schooner picture in the whole video. After seeing 5 mins. you have seen it all. The rest is repetition.",1503619200,,402,4.10126582278481
