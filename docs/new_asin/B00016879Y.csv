That's right, ""CyberMutt"" is here, the beautiful story about a boy and his not-so-ordinary dog.  In this heartwarming story, Rex is brought back to health after heroically riskying his own life to save a quirky but brilliant scientist (the famous ""Judd Nelson"").  The catch to bringing Rex back to life, however, is that Judd Nelson must dump his life's work and research into a mutt.  Now Rex is a cyborg that pwns anyone who gets in his way.  But not to fear, Rex is still the same lovable animal with what many people consider to be a charming personality.

  Join Rex as he battles hooligans and conspirators. Enjoy the first movie that touches upon the age old question, ""What would happen if you inserted a computer chip into a dog's brain?""

  Tonight, you're gonna chill with Rex",1127692800,4,1013,4.752873563218391
