8212002,2,B000A0FJRY,"This is not a Byrds DVD. This is a low key Gene Clark show done in 1986 with a back up band. They perform a few Byrds songs, along with Clark's solo stuff. The band is solid and their playing and singing are pretty good. The lead guitarist is very good. The Byrds stuff they do is not record perfect but then they aren't The Byrds and it's 20 years after. They interpret the songs like a quality club cover band.

Gene is in good physical health here and looks and sings well.  There are a few real Byrds clips as ""added bonus material"". I say added as there are only nine songs to the live part. The bonus Byrds vids are  :  Turn Turn, Tambourine Man, All I Really Want To Do, Chestnut Mare, Times Are a Changin, Rock and Roll Star.",1315094400,,733,4.104895104895105
