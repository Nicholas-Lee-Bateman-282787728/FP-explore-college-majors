2280951,5,B0009DWL96,The Pacifier is a funny family friendly movie that the whole family will enjoy.  It is appropriate for all age ranges while still remaining humorous and compelling.  I usually do not sit through entire films and was able to easily watch The Pacifier starring Vin Diesel.  Vin Diesel is hired to protect a family of high energy children while their mother goes away for a short time. The film is easy to watch and I found myself smiling several times.  Vin Diesel allows himself to be vulnerable but still show a strong heart and compassion.  Its worth a watch and we all enjoyed it!,1517875200,,582,4.5576923076923075

2280957,3,B0009DWL96,"Vin Diesel stars as a Navy SEAL who had failed to protect the life of a government scientist who had developed a secret device, and now he must watch over his widow and children-and find the secret device, which is located somewhere in the house. Complicating things is the fact that there are enemy agents also looking for same device. But not merely does Diesel watch over and live with the family, he has to play surrogate father to the younger and adolescent children. He also has to deal with an obnoxious school principal, even going so far as to arrange a wrestling match with him at the high school where the teenage son attends.

Yes, it's gimmicky all around, and perhaps Vin Diesel was in it on a lark or because he needed money, and he parodies his macho image by doing a Panda dance for a little girl and there are jokes about his male ""boobs"". Still basically good as silly family entertainment.",1511481600,,909,4.509090909090909

2281165,5,B0009DWL96,"My 5 yr old has loved this movie since she was about 2 yrs old... she watched it with her older  ousins back in the day and as repeatedly asked to watch it again. I caved one night and rented it here on amazon. It costs pretty much the same no matter where you're renting from. This was the first time renting a movie through amazon. It was easy to order and easy to cast onto our living room tv.
Vin Disel plays a Navy seal, who is sent to protect the family of a man, who invented some type of cyber disk or something (i don't know what it was, but it was important). The mother is called out of the house and he is left to care for the 5 (maybe 6?) kids on his own. It's good for all ages really.

When my 5 yr old watched it again she asked to watch immediately after... I said ""boy you really lIke this movie huh?"" And she responded with, ""Yes! But its definitely not because of Shane's muscles!""
That's wonderful. It's starting already.... {{scratching my head}}",1460937600,,968,4.1436170212765955

2281338,4,B0009DWL96,"It's a plot used before many times with action heroes--Schwartzenegger, The Rock--of the no-nonsense military man through duty or some other vagaries of Fate becoming guardian of a group of unruly youngsters. This time around Vin Diesel's the star, as a SEAL assigned to guard the offspring of a murdered scientist while the mother goes to Switzerland to recover the project he was working on. Along the way, the unwary bodyguard encounters surrogate fatherhood of the most undisciplined kind, settles in, and solves the kids' problems and foils the bad guys, too, while finding a bit of romance.

Nothing new but it's light entertaining fare for an afternoon.  Some fairly good action at the beginning and a pretty good fight scene at the end. The formula for getting into the vault is also interesting.",1437782400,,804,4.992537313432836

It is family fun and we have watched it many times together since we bought it. As there are so many reviews about the story line, let me say what I liked about the movie.
1. When my son wants to play with a bullying kid or a kid who doesn't treat him well, I quote what Lt. Wolfe tells Zoe when her friends party at her house and ransack it: You have to respect yourself.
2. Look in the eye and state what you have to say firmly and boldly. This will keep off your bully. This is what Seth does to his bullying coach.

And finally, a movie where Vin Diesel has opportunity to act and he does pretty good. If you have young kids and would like to watch something together then this is a great choice.",1410825600,,825,4.0

2281519,5,B0009DWL96,"Vin Diesel has a surprising but decent role as Shane Wolfe, a hard nosed Navy Seal who discovers that he has become a bodyguard for the family of a deceased scientist who created a missile defense system program. While also searching for the hidden program, he finds the family is less than thrilled to have him there as he has no qualms about laying down the rules. While their mother is away, seeking something her husband hid in a bank in Zurich, he discovers life on the home front can be its own form of hell as he is tested from the largest to the smallest, including the pet duck. It is when the family is attacked by NK spies looking for the program that the family finally understands why he is there and things go more smoothly and they actually begin to bond. He discovers, the boy, wants to be an actor, not a wrestler, and deals accordingly with a nasty bullying coach as well as taking the play on as director when the director quits in frustration. The eldest girl can't drive and he finally takes her in hand to teach her, The younger girl, a Firefly scout, has problems with a local boy scout troop and he teaches her and her troop to defend themselves, after they crash their cookie stand. He also learns how to change a diaper and discovers that the ridiculous panda dance done for the baby, is actually more than it seems when he discovers the hidden chamber where the program is hidden. This is one movie that is family oriented, more like the Disney movies of old, and rather more entertaining, as there is no cursing or overt innuendoes at all. While some is a bit contrived, it can be overlooked as it is meant to be more in good fun than anything else.",1410134400,,1677,4.378205128205129

2281582,4,B0009DWL96,"Take a family whose government scientist father was just killed, send the mother on a necessary trip to find the key to the top-secret project her husband left behind, bring in a soldier to guard the five children, and wait for results.

Among the kids are two self-absorbed teenagers, a girl who keeps flunking driving and a boy who would rather be in a stage musical than on the wrestling team. The middle child is a little girl Firefly (think Girl Scout or Brownie) whose troop keeps getting bullied by their masculine counterparts. After her comes the toddler who sprays his juice in people's faces and gets into everything, and then the baby who won't go to sleep without his usual bedtime routine.

. When the soldier makes everyone adhere to his security standards,, the teens are annoyed. Especially when the soldier catches out the girl's boyfriend sneaking into the house and breaks down the boy's bedroom door because he isn't wearing his locator as ordered. They grease the stairs with cooking oil. But the poor housekeeper is the one caught up in their trap. The put-upon housekeeper leaves immediately, luggage scattering, one step ahead of the soldier trying to keep her there.

So the soldier's in charge. And what a job he does. He mans up by strapping on the kiddie carrier and teaching the girl to drive. Along the way, he discovers the oldest boy's secret -- he's signed up for the local little theater -- and takes on the know-it-all wrestling coach. He even helps the middle girl with her problem.

He's really the pacifier for the family. This is an entertaining, funny movie. And did I mention the guard duck?",1402099200,,1633,4.73943661971831

2281598,1,B0009DWL96,"I got this movie for a buck at a bookstore. I thought it would be funny. Vin Diesel is a good actor but he can't save a poorly written script. The movie had trouble deciding what it was. It was a cross between action and a family movie. The acting was terrible but that mostly had to do with the writing. Britney Snow was especially bad in this and gave me a headache. The film has few funny moments. I didn't care too much about the characters and it's important for the viewer to like some of the characters. The movie is boring.

Carol Kane is a nice surprise but doesn't give a performance to match her Scrooged performance. Vin is disappointing but hopefully for him he got a good paycheck because this is a movie that will set your career back. Vin is great in action but given the proper script and movie he may do better. I had to turn off the movie close to half way through because it was so bad. I've seen this type of movie before but they were done right and enjoyable. Kindergarten Cop was a classic. Mr. Nanny is far from a masterpiece but it was better than this. I don't recommend this film. I recommend Adventures in Babysitting as it was a classic movie similar to this Cheers",1396742400,,1195,4.26431718061674

Diesel totally pooed it all over as Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe, who fails a mission that resulted in a death of a scientist. Now Wolfe must protect the dead man's family and what leads to is a un-funny sequences of filthy diaper jokes and usual Vin Diesel attitude.

We have a little girl following Lt Wolfe around asking him personal questions, and then when he tries to send her off, she screams ""disrespectful"" and says she is ""no longer interested"" in him. Sadly I think that scene nails what is wrong with the film. The kids are in charge and feel that their feelings and wants are the only things that matter, and  feel free to do and say whatever they want to, even when they hurt people. That is not a good message for a ""marvelous family film,"" nor is it funny.",1369353600,,765,4.387323943661972

This movie is a pleasant way to spend time with the family.",1262476800,,265,5.333333333333333
2281927,3,B0009DWL96,"Schwarzenegger tried it with KINDERGARTEN COP and the Rock tried it with THE GAME PLAN. Ice Cube did it with ARE WE THERE YET? With THE PACIFIER Vin Diesel joins the ranks of tough film action stars who strove to soften their hard-boiled images by co-starring in family friendly flicks with cutesy kids. THE PACIFIER, no, it won't blow anyone away with taut plotting or surprising twists or electrifying characterizations or anything like so. This flick pretty much falls into that category of been there, done that, nothing new here. That I ended up liking it is due more to the unexpected sight of Vin Diesel playing nanny to five incorrigible children. Naturally, the kids start out being bratty and subversive, that is, until Diesel's brand of tough love eventually gets them all squared-away. Far-fetched, you say? Heck, yeah! But fun? I would say, yes.

Vin Diesel plays U.S. Navy Seal Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, and no one is harder-than-nails than this squid. Doesn't mean he's not infallible. When Shane muffs a rescue ops by getting a key scientist killed, he gets a chance to atone by babysitting the dead scientist's five kids while their mom (Faith Ford) is away on a government assignment overseas. But Shane learns quick that he's got the parenting skills of a spoon, and that surveillance cameras, tracking devices, and enforced military discipline don't sit too well with traumatized children who had just lost their dad. Still, military regs are all Shane knows and so he persists in dispensing MREs and doling out code names (dubbing the kids ""Red One,"" ""Red Two,"" and so on all the way down to ""Red Baby""). Obviously, this can only lead to prankish shenanigans.

Vin Diesel and the Maryland suburbs go together like... well, they don't go together. And that's the humor of it. THE PACIFIER is partly a conventional Disney family film, partly a mild action thriller, and partly a fish-out-of-water story, and it's this last part which most makes the thing watchable. In his child-minding assignment, Shane Wolfe ends up being Den Mother to a bunch of girl scouts, the director to an amateur production of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and engages in a chase while riding a little girl's pink bicycle. Things get so preposterous that, later on, when ninjas show up, you just kinda roll with it. Oh, and there's also a homicidal duck somewheres.

Vin Diesel's stiffness actually works in his favor this time. He doesn't quite have that flair for slapstick, but he's so earnest in his pratfalls that the guy is actually endearing. Call me a sucker, but there's something pretty neat about a rugged, menacing-looking dude like the Diesel rendered all mushy by adorable tots. But, man, I can live without seeing yet one more dirty diaper gag in these kinds of movies.

Lauren Graham (GILMORE GIRLS) plays the attractive head school principal and Diesel's platonic love interest. Carol Kane's Romanian nanny (I think she's Romanian) is only in for a bit, but I like Carol Kane and think she's pretty funny. Brad Garrett is always funny, and he steals every scene as the offensive vice principal who's also an objectionable wrestling coach. He's an utter tool in this one, but I can't hate on him. He's just a funny, hairy guy. Of the kids in this film, the one to watch is Morgan York as the wiseacre Lulu. She develops the best chemistry with Vin.

THE PACIFIER goes down nice and easy if all you're looking for is an uncomplicated watch or maybe something wholesome enough to occupy the kids at home. Vin Diesel as an uncompromising Navy Seal-turned-frantic babysitter makes for a nice change of pace, and sometimes I guess you just get in the mood to watch a beefy, growly dude sorting it out with a gaggle of cute, unruly kids. Tough guy Charles Bronson starred in YES, VIRGINIA, THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS. Heck, even Kenny Rogers tried it with SIX PACK. Although it didn't take a ninja attack to start Kenny's bonding process with his kids.",1261180800,,3942,4.799705449189985

2281941,5,B0009DWL96,"I can't say enough how much I enjoy this movie! Vin Diesel is utterly irresistible as his tough guy act seems to play like just that- an act. His strength, warmth, and genuine chemistry with the child actors really shines through. A way too small turn by Lauren Graham is just icing on this family friendly comedy cake. Brad Garret is type-cast annoying in (one of the) villian roles. The beginning of the movie was rather startling as I hoped the father might show up in the end.

2281948,2,B0009DWL96,"I don't understand Vin Diesel.  He starts off as a goofy-looking breakdancer, builds up muscles and a glass-swallowing voice, becomes an action-flick superstar, and then he makes this flaming pile of cow flop.  What?  He couldn't have made another Riddick movie?  Fast and the Furious 12 not looking like a good career move?  The Pacifier surely wasn't a better option.

Anyway, much like Arnold Schwarzanegger doing ""Kindergarten Cop"", Sly Stallone doing ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot"", and Pacino doing ""Scent of a Woman"", Vin Diesel sold his acting sole for the almighty dollar.

Now his grisled voice makes him sound less like a tough guy, and more like a someone from Dateline's ""To Catch A Predator"".  Great.

I'm not even sure I watched the entire movie because the sheer vapid nature and banality of this movie caused me to go into a boredom-coma.  What I did catch, however, was the fact that Diesel plays a former Navy Seal who is assigned to protect some spoiled brats who deserve a beating.  It's nothing but Kindergarten Cop in a different setting, complete with the military order shouting and incredibly corny lines meant to make slow children and awkwardly unaware foreigners laugh.  The other thing I noticed was that Vin Diesel is incredibly unfunny, and has probably never told a successful joke in his life.  In each scene he appeared to be looking for a car to race, a Russian terrorist to attack, or someone to beat-up.

This is the vehicle starring Vin Diesel as a baby sitter/Navy seal/talent director...This is also one of the films that makes no sense if you start asking questions about it, or wonder how one sequence led to another. I can't fault the actor too much. He had been out of a job, presumably, for requesting too much money, and this Jackie Chan reject for Disney was a step up. Let's see--as a Navy Seal, he is directly involved in the death of a man who is important to National Security. As a result, he has to take care of the guy's kids, while Mom has to search a bank vault in Switzerland...

And the more you continue to dig into the plot, the less sense it makes. The film was okay on the big screen. One of a series of loud cinematic explosions with a paper thin set of characters. Transferred to the home screen (19 inches), it seems like a blip.

There's a duck in this movie. I suspect if there was a dog, there would be some confusion with the lead. Vin Diesel still looks like a shar pei with all the wrinkles removed.

The Pacifier was surely my pacifier as it lulled me into a peaceful sleep the first time I watched the movie. I forced myself to stay awake on the second try.  While some actors are gifted with the ability of versatility, Diesel should stick with action or dramatic films. He is no comedian and it is all too evident here. His superstar appeal could not carry the burden of a run-away script, an empty plot, and poor editing. The rest of the cast is okay at best.

I thought the blooper reel would be The Pacifier's saving grace - no dice.  The ""outrageous"" bloopers (as stated on the jacket) are not great at all. They are mainly a few line trips that even the cast didn't particularly find extremely amusing.

2281974,1,B0009DWL96,"I found myself asking `what was he thinking' quite a bit during this film.  I remember when it was first released I was excited to see a family comedy that looked entertaining but `The Pacifier' truly proves to be anything but.  It's the true definition of clich&eacute;d corny antics with no real plot other than some washed up implausible, prefabricated, ridiculous, contrived storyline that grows old before it gets started.  I felt like I had seen this done before in every other ridiculously unauthentic family comedy yet each and every other time I feel it was done better.  The first and largest mistake was the casting of Vin Diesel as the lead.  He's not funny, not even in the whole tough guy gets schooled kinda way they tried for.  He doesn't land a single joke and his physical humor is nothing more than awkward and just plain painful to watch.  The second major mistake was the inclusion of Brad Garrett's character.  Not the fact that Garrett played him (although I find Garrett annoying and unfunny anyways) but his character as a whole, even played by someone else, was a total waste of script paper.

The story follows Shane Wolfe, Navy S.E.A.L., as he's assigned to watch the children of a slain scientist while his widow is retrieving some valuable information from his safety deposit box in Switzerland.  In her absence Shane has to deal with intruders looking for some top secret disc or something like that.  Shane's biggest problem though is the children who don't want him there and fight him every step of the way.  Our biggest problem is the script that the actors muddle through and we have to try and find entertainment and or enjoyment in.  That is a hard job and one not worth fulfilling.

Vin Diesel was at one time a Hollywood `it' guy.  He was in the big blockbusters of the season thanks to his pivotal role in `The Fast and the Furious'.  After that he was admired by all men and swooned over by all women.  But it's apparent that his career has taken a dive.  His choice in films lately has been anything but inspired or even smart.  Turning up in a film much better suited for washed up talents as apposed to rising stars goes to further twist the knife.  I can't really think of anything nice to say about this movie.  Granted, there are a few scenes, very few, that made me chuckle, like when Shane teaches the Girl Scout troop to fight and they get to try it out on some rival troopers, but it's not enough for me to say I'd consider watching this mess again.  It was nice to see Lauren Graham, but I say that only because she's very easy on my eyes.  In fact the ending alone is so outrageously ridiculous that I can't help but chastise this movie for trying to be taken seriously.

2281992,5,B0009DWL96,"I cant believe I just said, but it true-and I am 19 years old.  To be honest, I am not a huge of Vin.  The only action flick of his I enjoyed was the first Fast and The Furious (and I did not think that was great- Just Good).  And I never cared much for everything else that followed- xXx, A Man Apart, Knockaround Guys, or Chronicles of Riddick.  So I had pretty much viewed every film he was in to sort of be the same thing- Some adrenaline feuled action movie soley aim for guys.  However, when I first trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it.  Its was VIN DIESEL in a DISNEY MOVIE.  Howver, I did not hear much good stuff about it, so I missed it in theaters.
But of course I would catch it on DVD some time later and I very much enjoyed.  I found myself laughing throughout the movie.  So far, this is the only Vin movie I am considedring to buy no matter how many times I have seen it.  Here is the plot.
Shane Wolf (Vin) is a disgraced navy seal after having failed to rescue a Professor who was creating a military program called ""Ghost"" which many terrorists want their hands on.  His next assignment is rather simple- keep the professor's children while there mom is out of town helping the army obtain ""Ghost"".  The kids are Zoe (Brittany Snow), Seth (Max Theriot), Lulu (Morgan York), and toddlers Tyler and Peter.  However, these kids have a problem with authority and they seem to defy him at any chance they get.  It seems that Shane's high discplinary skills are no match for a group of kids.  However, they eventually all realize they may need to be depend on each other when the danger.  Shane starts to deeply understand these kids and the troubles they are going through, while the kids give him a lesson on how to live a normal suburbian life.
All in all, Pacifier was a very enjoyable film.  Howver, my only problem in the film was actually Vin himself.  I know he was the real selling point of the movie (and proboboly why the movie made $100 million +) but I did not find him to be funny even he when he so desperatly tries.  The only scene he made me laugh was this part where bologne falls on his shirt and he says angerly ""This is my favorite shirt"".  I believe the kids were the real stars of the movie.  They were really and made me laugh alot.  Pretty everyone except Vin was funny ESPECIALLY Brad Garret as the sadistic wrestling coach.  He was hilarious.

get the safe deposit box left by her husband. To regain his credebility and

reputation our Navy Seal agrees to house sit the five Plummer children. It

turns into quite an adventure for the Seal. He has his hands full. There is

also a hidden secret that is being searched by the forces of evil.

  He winds up using his skills to help the Plummer children out of various

situations that they are facing. It is especially humorous when one of

the daughters uses his training to disperse a group of boy scouts who are harassing their cookie sells. Vin Deisel steals the show when he whips the

obnoxious vice-principal in a wrestling match. In the end the Plummer

The kids are nothing but trouble (at home and at school) and the nanny gives up.  To make matters worse, the mother's trip gets extended.  Now Diesel is in for the long haul in an area he has no experience with.

We get plenty of scenes of Diesel being dumbfounded by civilians and their lack of discipline.  But eventually Diesel begins to deal with the issues one by one.  There are the individual kids, the scouts, school, the principal and vice-principal, sports teams and even enemy agents after the scientist's work.  Eventually Diesel rises to the top as things are put straight.

Diesel's inflexible military ways really take a beating for the civilian influence in this movie.  While the film does tough on the typical clueless-man meets diapers, it also moves into new territory such as pectoral development and how it is viewed by the young.

2282019,3,B0009DWL96,"""The Pacifier"" is Vin Diesel's ""Kindergarten Cop""  (apparently every muscle bound action film star has to have at least one in his repertoire).

In it, Diesel plays a Navy Seal officer sent to ""baby sit"" the five unruly children (ranging in age from infant to late teen) of an inventor who was murdered when he was in Diesel's protective custody.  But Diesel, a tough guy who has been trained to take on the baddest dudes imaginable (and a man with apparently only one t-shirt to his name), finds he has gotten more than he bargained for in this latest assignment.

""The Pacifier"" pretty much goes straight for all the garden variety, lowbrow slapstick routines one would expect from such a corny setup.  Yet, the movie generates a surprising number of genuinely charming moments, thanks mainly to Vin Diesel himself who, though still not an actor, manages to convey a certain befuddled innocence that works well in this part.  There are some perfectly awful scenes in the closing stretches that work hard to erase much of the goodwill the movie has managed to generate up to that point, but if you can look past the badness and you're in a forgiving mood, you might not hold them against the entire film.  When all is said and done, it's not really much of a movie, but it's at least better than the genuinely dreadful ""Daddy Day Care"" and the two ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films.

And I sure would like to know what magical spot-removal product Diesel used to get that mustard stain out of that white t-shirt.  I'd hate to think it was all just a Hollywood trick or - more likely - the result of a continuity error.  But I probably know better.",1155513600,,1643,4.57679180887372

Soon Shane's over his head in chaos, with frequent visits to the school principals (Graham and Garrett).

After opening with a big action sequence, we pretty much know that there'll be at least two more: one in the middle to remind us of the threat and one at the end to tie up loose ends. And there's not a single thread left untied. Including the duck. This is such a heavily structured script that there's no doubt at all about what will happen, so we're left to enjoy the details. And at least there's a lot of goofy fun to be had along the way. It's not particularly clever or original, but it's lively and energetic and sometimes just a little inspired.

The three older kids turn out to be superb actors--all have strong scenes that show surprising depth for this kind of movie. And they prove to be adept on-screen foils for Diesel's muscle-man act. Diesel wisely avoids hamming it up, allowing the filmmakers to poke gentle fun at his beefy physicality (on the other hand, the gratuitous scene in which he walks around the house in nothing but a towel would, in real life, spark a lawsuit of Jacko proportions). There's not nearly enough of Kane; and the extremely game Garrett is only on screen to be humiliated time and time again, including one scene that's surprisingly mean-spirited.

2282039,3,B0009DWL96,"'The Pacifier' is a typical example of how Hollywood studios make family picture these days, in this case Disney and Spyglass.  Get a star, throw in some actions (use car and kung-hu), add some jokes (slapsticks or toilet humor), and have some special appearances of celebrities or Oscar nonimees, or if you can't, at least get some cute kids.  Director?  No matter.  Just do it before someone else does it for this spring season.

[GOOD THINGS] It is true that 'The Pacifier' is made with run-of-the-mill formula, but it does not follow that the film is not enjoyable.  I actually smiled a lot, and the idea of putting muscular Vin Diesel (as Lt. Shane Wolfe from US Navy) in the dysfunctional family as body guard from underground organization is not bad.  And as to the jokes, there are plenty of them, and the clever duck is also funny to see.

Another good thing about the film is some of the relative newcomers.  Among the kids, Morgan York playing precocious little girl Lulu is a real find.  The director must have known it, for the film spends considerable time in showing her character.  Surely his decision is justified.

[BAD THINGS] But there is something I do not like about the film.  Though the death(s) are not directly shown, they are suggested, and the family who need Vin's protection in fact suffer from the death of the father.  Isn't that unnecessary in making family pictures?

In addition to this, there are many ill-advised decisions.  Now let me count, 1)  bullying wrestling coach (Brad Garrett) who is simply there to be despised  2) Helga, babysitting lady with intentionally heavy accent played by Carol Kane who looks like coming from 'The Addams Family'  and 3) the 'ninja' idea which should have been dead back in the 80s.  Oh, and 4)  the suddenly introduced ""love interest"" (school principal played by Lauren Graham) for Vin Diesel, which is far from convincing.

But the best way to describe the quality of 'The Pacifier' is to take a look at the CV of director Adam Shankman, which who has done J-Lo's unremarkable romantic comedy 'The Wedding Planner,' sweet but melodramatic 'Walk to Remember' and 'Bringing Down the House' so-so Steve Martin comedy.  They are all commercially successful, but there are nothing particularly outstanding about them.  Though it is fun to see, 'The Pacifier' does not change my impressions about his films.",1130630400,,2377,4.841191066997519
2282040,1,B0009DWL96,"The movie The Pacifier was funny, considering it was Disney. But there were also some strange moments that made me uncomfortable.

I do like the idea though of action hero actor types in comedy roles. Bruce Willis in Death Becomes Her is a prime example. Just love it. Similarly, I like Vin Diesel in a comedy role, it''s cute, hope to see more of the same.

So yeah. It was alright. Some obvious bits. Some awkward moments. But all in all, fun - funny.

Now that I've been rather vague, I'll address my problems with the film.

Maybe it is personal. Because I had a conflict with my school principal, vice principal, and head of security once upon a time. They assumed things where they not ought to have. Keep in mind this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and me being the alternative individual I am got into trouble by standing up for my (and others) rights. Coloring hair ""unnatural"" colors suddenly became forbidden, wearing all black or dog collars got you kicked out (among other absurd changes). This was all in order to (presumably) protect against a Columbine type event happening at our school. But what they seemed to not realize was that by picking on us alternative folk, they were making us feel more victimized, scorned - giving us more reason to rebel. You try to suppress us? Then you'll really see a fight!

It bothered me that they did not care who any of us are. Never mind that I am an AP student, in the top 10th of the class (I think?) ... no, forget about all that I contribute to the school, because now you condemn me for wearing black, having short hair, and looking utterly miserable every day. And who wouldn't be miserable?! It is high school, and not only is the world against you, but all of the sudden everyone is convinced that you are going to shoot them during lunch hour. Random locker searches my a$$.

So that's my true-to-life anger on the subject. Here is how it played out in the movie. Something that I believe should not be seen as an acceptable form of behavior from an adult/authority figure.

Murney (the vice principal, an authority figure) has got it out for Seth, for one, calling the kid names like: Creeper (also note the boy wears all black, is an alternative home boy, yo). Allows Seth to be bullied (physically pushed around) by other kids (not using ones authority for good/justice is just as bad as not having it to begin with). Murney implies that Seth is gay or at least effeminate for wanting to be in theater plays rather than on the wrestling team by calling him ""twinkle toes"" and ""prancer."" He also says such a decision is what happens when there's no man in the house (meaning a father). Firstly, that is sexual harassment. You have no right to bring up what you assume to be a person's sexual affiliation. If he is gay or not, it does not matter, either way you are suggesting that it is a bad thing. Secondly, at the end of the movie they try to have Murney in a humorous position in drag as a nun in the play. I do not see why he would ever agree to this, it seems very out of character. But it also irks me that he got into no trouble for any of his actions, he was not held accountable.

I would also like to add that the 'Panda Dance' true purpose was so obvious it wasn't even funny. Really, it wasn't funny, simply embarrassing to watch. And just WHO has a basement like that? Do you build it before or after the house? If you move, do you tell the new owners that there is a secret room just under the foundation of the house? Are they hooked up to a gas station to get those flame throwers to be ready at all times? WTF???

Ahem. So I'll watch it again if I must, but would rather avoid getting angry again - so I won't.",1130025600,,3698,4.340086830680174

The Pacifier is a very entertaining, family movie, with awesome action seems, a good blend of humor, and character development.  Most of the heavy violence that occurs in the movie is implied, rather than directly protrayed, making it appropriate for children as young as six years old.  What most impressed me was seeing Vin Diesel in a genre that allowed him to show some more of his talent as an actor.  Here, he gets a chance to play an action hero with depth.  His character has feelings, experiences self doubt, has a very dry sense of humor, and is capable of a whole range of emotions.  What is particularly cool is the way Vin figures out the secret for getting past the doctor's elaborate security system.  It is funny, and a nice tie in to the rest of the story.

Sometimes its nice to rent a movie and know that in the end, enemies will become friends and the bad guys get what they deserve.  I thought Vin Diesel was really good in this movie.  It was the first movie of his I ever watched and I was impressed.  I imagine it takes a lot of guts to go from hardcore action flicks to a Disney movie and I, for one, respect him for that.

It's about this Navy Seal guy named Shane Wolf who has to take care of these kids after there dad dies. He has been assigned a mission to watch over these kids while their mom is away. While he's taking care of them he teaches them a lot of things. He's always keeping an eye on them at school, home and everywhere. He teaches the oldest daughter how to drive, and teaches the oldest son how to dance and fight. He teaches the youngest daughter to not be afraid and he teaches the baby to be potty-trained. I better be quiet before I ruin the movie for you. I think this is the best Disney movie ever. A lot of people I know love this movie and so will you.

 The reason I think you should watch this movie is because it is the best Disney movie ever. There is a really hot guy on the movie, some girls will like it because him. It's really good entertainment for the whole entire family to watch.

 It sounds like how we live because the kids go to school and so do we. And they have babysitters just like we do.  The kids also have really big attitudes, just like us. Shane Wolf teaches them stuff just like our parents teach us stuff.

 It's really good because it's a family movie. It makes you want to have fun. It's like real life. It's really hilarious. It's totally cool. This movie makes you come together as a family to watch it.

 Kids, parents, adults, teens, everybody will love this movie. It has a lot of comedy and drama. It has a lot of attitude. One part is really sad; it makes you want to cry because it's so sad about when and how their dad died.

 What I am saying is that everybody will love this movie. I really encourage you to watch this movie. It's a rock on movie! You'll wish you were in this movie having just as much fun as them!

 You'll really love this movie so try watching this movie. It's only an hour and thirty minutes long and its rated PG. It's a really good movie, so please check out The Pacifier.

The only thing wrong that caught my attention was in the beginning of the movie where Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) was briefing his troops about the upcoming mission to save Mr. Plummer, he was a few feet away from the other troops and he was more or less yelling.  That's the only thing that was in this movie that would never happen.  A friend of mine didn't like the jet ski scene shortly after that, but for me, this movie touched a little on every one of my senses (action, tender moment, family, good fight scene, excellent dialougue, the lone hero (ex: Riddick, Blade) I would suggest this film to anyone of any age.

And there is the attraction of the scene in which Shane Wolfe pops into the kitchen sporting nothing but a towel. During which I found myself very much at one with the Girl Scouts ogling him from the dining room.

 Just watch it and see what I mean, their isn't anything special about this movie, that will make kids want it, yeah a laugh hear and their, but it's nothing that funny at all!!! Yeah, Vin Diesl is a great actor( Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick, XXX, and The Fast and The Furious), this is one of the first children/ family films he's done, and he does a great job acting too!!! Their are other great actors like Brad Garret (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls)!!!

 The movie still, isn't impressive though, even though it has some great actors and a good story, but it just isn't at the caliber of where some great family films out their!!! The story starts Vin Diesel  (a navy seal) is assigned and protect their family!!! The dad of the family was working on some type of secret government project, and some terroists are after them!!! Through this process, Vin Diesel falls in love with the kids and helps bring the family together, which was sweet and all!!!

 I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it is more of a below par film!!! I guess if you're looking for a safe family movie this would be a good choice, but there are better family movies out there!!! It does have a good message though and you should see this at least once, but I'm not sure it will be one you'll quickly add to your collection!!! Hey, it's just another Disney film out their!!!

It is billed as a comedy, but honestly I didn't find myself laughing all that much during this movie. don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible movie - but it seems like all the truly funny parts were used in the comercials and therefore we knew what to expect.

Some of the movie was down right lame. The scenes where Vin is fighting the 'ninja's' are just terrible, but if you suffer through them the story itself isn't too bad.

I enjoyed the movie for the most part. I think the key to this movie is going into it not expecting to be laughing the whole time. Go into it with the idea that you will spend about 2 hrs watching a decent movie, but not anything more than that or you will be disappointed.

But I swear, thinking back to all the movies I have seen in the last 30 plus years, I cannot think of one worse.  Terrible fight scenes, stupid lines, cornball acting, and the most unrealistic portrayal of school life I have ever seen. Vin actually stood in the school yard and could pick out all the children at once.  One was in class, one was at cheerleading practice, one was at wrestling practice, and the other, I cant remember.  But he could actually see every one of them from the playground.  What a joke.

The scene where the ninjas break into the house and fight Vin is ridiculous.  They hit him several times with whatever they are carrying in their hands but it has NO effect...I guess because they are nothing but silly pieces of flimsy plastic.  Yeah...if I break into a house...thats what Im going to use...plastic sticks...how intimidating!!  I thought Steven Segal was the worst actor out there...but Vin Diesel just proved me wrong.  Several scenes towards the end required him to smile...he cant even do that without making me cringe.  Aything funny or anything emotional (except maybe rage...and even that is a stretch) is clearly WAY beyond Vin's ability.

The truly scary thing about this movie is that several higher ups in the movie business had to have seen this embarrasment before its release...and they released it anyway.  Surely someone could have raised their hand and said ""We gotta keep this under wrap...it just sucks too much!!""  Its billed as a comedy...but there is NOTHING funny about this at all.

2282104,4,B0009DWL96,"If I had children between 5-12, I'd suggest they see this. It is ""Kindergarten Cop,"" ""Uncle Buck,"" and ""Mr. Mom,"" with a light ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" thrown in. It is not as good as any of those, but I am not 10 years old. Your young boy or girl will love it.

It is a mix of slapstick, family style humor and situation gags. Nothing in the story will surprise moviegoers, but nothing will offend them either. It is a fun, decent, average 1960s-style Disney film.

The plot:
Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel), Navy Seal, is assigned to protect the family of a slain scientist. Their home may have a special device the enemy wants. The mother is out of town trying to open a safe deposit box, and Shane's stay last longer than expected.

Shane, muscle-bound and bald, looks intimidating. He's tough, a ""leave no man behind"" kind of guy. All man. As a protector/babysitter, he runs aground into all of the expected gags. He changes a diaper with typical disgust, drives the kids to school, and feeds them dried MREs (Meals Ready To Eat). Parenting is new, and he starts learning.

He catches a boyfriend sneaking in, and has run-ins with the wresting coach, played by huge Brad Garrett. Some minor subplots about relating to the children bring a few laughs and ""awes.""

It isn't really an action movie, not beyond a few ""Home Alone"" scenes.

Vin Diesel shows he can act here, and occasionally shines in a few sequences. When he finds the code in the ""Peter Panda Dance,"" we see an indication that there's hope for him in a better movie that relies on his personality more than his biceps.

Critically, from an adult perspective, Brad Garrett was not believable as a wrestling coach, and Lauren Graham as the military women-turned-principal did not work. It was as much of a casting problem as it was a writing and directing issue.

Brittany Snow as oldest daughter Zoe Plummer is great. She plays the character honestly, and within her ability. There a Hillary Duff aspect to her, with an edge. Unfortunately, Faith Ford as her mom, Julie Plummer overplayed her. Luckily, we only suffer with her in a few scenes.

Oldest son, Seth Plummer, is likewise overplayed by Max Thieriot, who seems like he was handed the roll for growing up in Hollywood. His conversion from weak trench coat outsider, to thespian acting in ""Sound of Music,"" was more than a stretch.

The nanny, Helga, played by Carol Kane, is given terrible lines. Remembering her in ""The Princess Bride,"" I shuddered as she tried to squeeze out comedy.

The movie is disposable, and will not rank among Disney's best movies. However, it shows that Disney is willing to toss a few dollars into a movie that is clean, with a message that is pro-family, pro-parents, pro-father, and old fashioned fun.

If you enjoy movies like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""Spy Kids"" you should find this one right up your alley. It is a bit more sugar coated than ""Kindergarten Cop"", but entertaining still. It was nice to see Vin Diesel do one like this since his image has usually been the tough guy. As Schwartzenegger did with ""Kindergarten Cop"", Vin Diesel now shows he can do comedy and light family acting as well.

The story involves a leader of a seal team protecting a scientist family after he is killed for project Ghost. Diesel plays the seal leader. His encounters are mostly comedic ones with the children and a few people at the school. Although there is a little violence in the beginning and at the end, this is not rough for most children. I have seen much rougher on TV.

Diesel is a natural and I hope to see him do more. I really wish he had done the second Triple X movie. I think it would have done better at the box office.

2282124,1,B0009DWL96,"This film was bad.  Not in the sense that there was at least one redeemable scene in the entire film, but in the sense that everything from the opening to closing credits in this film was horrendous.  There was nothing of value in this entire film.  I have no idea how this film grossed a little over thirty million in its first weekend.  There must have been a good trailer before it, or perhaps there was a generation of people that missed the film when it was originally called Kindergarten Cop.  Either way, for an hour an a half we were duped into watching nothing more than scene after scene of diaper humor, a comically unbalanced Diesel wading through the supposed funny moments, a duck, scenes where the baby of the family is left unattended, sloppy (and I mean sloppy) editing, and quick resolutions that will leave the avid film watcher confused and disoriented.  Coupled with clich after clich, Diesel proves that he is better left in the action genre, the leaving the humor to anyone else in the world except for him.

There are several people that I am extremely upset with in the world of film today.  Tim Burton is currently at the top of my list, but right below him is Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon.  I grew up with the humor of these guys by watching the decently funny Reno 911 and the hysterically funny MTV show, The State.  When I saw that they had written this film, I was expecting to see a new level of comedy.  I was hoping to see a film where the humor was sharp, the dialog was perhaps paradoxical, while laughing at all the ways they could play off the already clich scenes that have been done in early 80s movies.  Alas, this was not the case.  They literally sold out.  Garant and Lennon created a film that fit well into the structure of Disney by giving us bathroom humor, jagged bonding moments, and that inevitable unclimactic ending which sums everything up in a nice little bow.  Did they need the cash?  My guess is ""yes"".  For those that may be fans of Reno 911 or The State, I would not go into this film expecting classic humor, but instead be prepared for unfunny diaper scenes which seem to be the staple of this film.

Since the story was filled with more holes than Swiss cheese, it seemed only right for Diesel to fall into that one of those holes as well.  He cannot do comedy.  This film, The Pacifier, proves that.  There were no scenes in which he was able to generate a laugh by anyone in our house.  His comic timing seemed invisible to non-existent, all the while it just seemed as if he kept waiting for the chance to walk around without his shirt and perhaps fight some bad-guys.  You could tell that he felt uncomfortable in this film and was not ready to handle the pressures of comedy.  Perhaps it was the direction that he was given, but Diesel continually went in and out of character.  His main focus was to watch the children, but whenever he had to do something else, he completely forgot about the children and moved on.  This is hard to explain, but there were several scenes when Diesel left small children unattended in the house, or in the car, or somewhere off-screen while he went searching for his ""actual"" mission.  I was surprised that Social Services didn't try to boycott this film.  Perhaps it was Diesel's way of being funny, but for me it just came off as sloppy.  Comedy is hard and Diesel needs more work at it before he headlines another Disney bomb.

Finally, I would like to say that Adam Shankman needs to really work on his direction skills.  I know he has done more films than just this, but for some odd reason the editing was horrible in this film.  Scenes would occur randomly while conclusions to those scenes would arise sporadically as well.  It was chaos.  We, as viewers, jumped around so much in this film that you just didn't get a feel of any of the characters.  The Disney touch was so apparent that it forced the story to become unstructured and confusing.  The wrestling to Nazi scene was especially bad, in fact, the entire Sound of Music moment was painful and disruptive to the entire film.  Didn't these children's father just pass away horribly about two weeks ago?  Nobody seemed to care and there wasn't one tear shed throughout the entire film.  The structure on helping the children while continuously looking for ""Ghost"" just didn't fit.  There needed to be more stories, more moments between the children, more glue instead of chaos holding these scenes together.  The random relationship between Diesel and Graham was idiotic, while the entire concept of falling in love with these children in just short of two weeks blew my mind.  We were all over the place in this film, and it hurt.

Overall, this film was worse than pathetic.  All three key elements to this film, the writers, the ""major"" star, and the director just didn't seem to be on the right page.  It was sad to see such great comics like Lennon and Garant churn out duds like this.  It was sad to see Hollywood resort to the clichd 80s concept of bringing an action star into comedy and watch him fail miserably.  The story was horrendous and glued together by a two-year old.  The comedic moments were non-existent, while Diesel wandered through the entire film, in and out of character, hoping to revive a dying career.  Nobody made me laugh.  Nobody was funny.  Nothing was worth viewing a second time.  If you are looking for a decent comedy that fully represents the key elements in this film, I would check out the comedic actor John Candy tackle it in Uncle Buck.  This film should be burned from Hollywood's records.

Maybe it's seeing Vin diesel play a role you never would think you would see him in, as a U.S Navy Seal protecting 5 childeren from the clutches of bad guys. Now this movie has everything to make a movie good, you have

Action, humour, sentimental value and good ole fun for the whole family to enjoy. The movie in the beginning felt like it was a little rushed and you are kind of thrown right into the plot with no backstory really but hey it's a disney movie you can't really be too picky here. This movie has great scenes and some hilarious scenes. Just seeing A U.S navy seal trying to run 5 disobedient kids is entertaining enough.

For the parents i really see no offensive material that will corrupt your children just some toilet humour, some  action scenes with no blood and no cursing, just a fun clean movie your kids will enjoy and you too. Out of 5 stars i rate it 4.5 so i will round it up to 5. So in conclusion if you want a good movie that will have your family laughing in tears i suggest you get this movie or atleast rent it.",1121385600,,1193,4.178260869565217
2282126,4,B0009DWL96,"I didn't think that liking Vin Diesel would ever be in the cards for me. I just didn't care for him in The Fast and The Furious. Might as well forget about XXX. Oh, I did like his voice in The Iron Giant. But now I can honestly say that I like the guy. And I can finally see why so many other woman find him so, well, hunky.

Diesel stars as Shane, a Navy Seal who is assigned the task of guarding a family of five children. Their father was an inventor and he created some software called The Ghost that would enable the takeover of another country's missiles. Or something like that. That's not really important. What is important is the characters, and they're really good and surprisingly well-developed in this movie. All the kids are adorable, especially the little girl, who inquires as to whether her boobs will someday be as big as Shane's. ""They're not BOOBS!"" he says. So funny. There's also a couple of rebellious teenagers, one boy and one girl-- the girl is an accident-behind-the-wheel waiting to happen and the boy has a secret that just may surprise you. So of course, this hardened military man will eventually soften up. Brad Garrett co-stars (ohhhh, how I loathe his character... what a jerk!) as well as Lauren Graham as the eventual love interest for Shane.

Very cute movie. The kids will love it and parents can even enjoy this one too. Laugh outloud funny. Vin Diesel delivers. RECOMMENDED!!",1121299200,,1416,4.592885375494071
2282127,3,B0009DWL96,"It's another Mr. Mom movie, this time with Vin Diesel in the leading role. The family's original Dad was a secret scientist, and was assassinated before he revealed all of his secrets. Mom, mostly in the dark about Dad's work, is out trying to recover something left in a Swiss safe deposit box - safe even from her. Vin's job is to guard the kids while Mom's away.

It's pretty predictable after that. There's the encounter with the Dirty Diaper, trying to figure out how to feed the family when they turn down military meal packs (""You expect me to eat all those carbs?"" complains the teen girl), shopping, girl scout-like meetings, and the trials of school. There are other trials, like when the boy is found with an Aryan hair dye and a swastika arm band. The biggest trial may be yours, when you're asked to believe that military unarmed combat is glorified pro wrestling. Don't worry, though, this is just a feel-good comedy where everything works towards a happy, sappy ending.

I wouldn't go out of my way to see this one again, but I wouldn't run if I saw it coming on the screen. (Well, I saw it in a plane at 35,000 feet - running would have created other problems.) It's the McDonalds of movies: predictable, mostly digestible, just what you want when you don't want to think about it, but not really memorable. Except maybe a few visual gags, like the bandolier of juice boxes.

2282128,3,B0009DWL96,"There are legions of fans of Vin Diesel who would buy a ticket for everything he decided to make - and for good reason: the guy has charisma and screen appeal.  But THE PACIFIER is one for only the most devoted Dieselers, those who also have a very high tolerance for the sugarcoated, happy-wappy, Disney flicks that feel as though they were written in an afternoon and shot the next day.

Even the writers knew what Vin Diesel fans like and the movie opens with a hint of espionage with Diesel as a Navy Seal up to his action tricks.  But soon he is taken out of water and plunged into a household (the family of the widow of his failed Navy Seal opening mission) where is uncomfortably cast in the role of babysitter/house mom/inept disciplinarian - you know the oft repeated situation of 'fish out of water'.

The whole thing is rather silly and overplayed and Diesel is a charmer, but a comedian he is not.  Once again toward the end the writers have tried to place him in his own comfortable thriller role, but even that melts into Disney goo.  Only recommended for those seeking some light sing-songy diversion.  Grady Harp, July 05",1121126400,,1138,4.521951219512195

I am however just expressing opinions like everyone else here and I hope this opinion will help others reconsider before subjecting themselves to what can only be considered to be a waste of time, money and celluloid. First off, Vin is just not able to do this!!!! The Rock can, and did, pull off something interesting in terms of a comedic character portrayal in ""Be Cool"". Vin however cannot! The story moves from high espionage to high bollocks within the first 10 min. Vin as the leader of a crack SEAL team works, Vin as the nanny for a group of precocious kids does not! When he is sent to nanny the brats he pulls down the ""boot camp"" drill on them and they resist. Is it funny ?? NO! I wish Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) from ""Full Metal Jacket"" was there to 'pacify'them as well as Vin for making such tripe! To spend more time talking about this movie is really more than it deserves but I felt I had a moral obligation to warn my fellow movie fans to stay clear!!

Anyway, besides being attacked by some ""bad"" North Korean spies and having to deal with all manner of silly senarios that have been played to death there is just not that much more than actually happens.

Not only do kids laugh, but adults as well.  I watched it with a few friends, and we were looking for a light evening and a few laughs -- something this film delivers.

Vin Diesel comes across a bit stiff throughout many parts of the movie, something that is part of his character, but may also be a part of his lack of familiarity with this type of film, being a star of the fast/action packed films.  But he pulls it off well as long as the viewer realizes that they should go in looking for a light hearted movie, fun and often silly action scene and dialogue, and on the whole a fun movie.",1121040000,,736,4.013698630136986

2282153,5,B0009DWL96,"How come I always miss the good movies when they cycle through the theaters? Probably because I'm no fan of the action flicks of the flavor Vin Diesel is known for, and don't pay all that much attention anyway. Regardless, I saw The Pacifier playing in a Wal-Mart one day and thought it looked good. Watched it with my family the following Friday night, and after a second run-through of my favorite fight scenes, sat down to write my review.

PLOT: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel, but you already KNEW that) is assigned to protect the Plummer family after the father, a military strategist, dies in an attempted rescue mission led by Lt. Wolfe. While Mrs. Plummer departs to recover her husband's secret plans, Shane is put in charge of the Plummer children: Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter and baby Tyler. Shane finds himself dealing with typical family issues, such as bratty teenagers, Lulu's Girl Scouts, and changing Tyler's diapers, all while maintaining the strictest of military discipline and protective vigilance.

BAD: (""Bad"" in this case is anything that might be objectionable to younger kids, since it IS supposed to be a family movie) There is an opening sequence where Shane leads a patrol of Navy SEALS to rescue Mr. Plummer. Shane and his crew dispatch bad guys with some well-placed blows, and well-choreographed action that results in most of the bad guys getting blown up. Shane fires a missile at a helicopter, taking it down. At first, everything seems well until Shane boards the military transport chopper and finds the pilot slumped in the cockpit. He turns, only to be hit (bloodlessly) by a bullet. Later violence consists of bloodless fast-paced kung-fu/karate/martial arts fights between dark-clad ninjas and Shane. Shane also has to dodge several booby traps, which could frighten young ones. Profanity consists of a dozen or so usages of God's name in vain, and one or two ""h*lls."" Lulu comments on Shane's physique, asking several different questions about his chest, and if she will have as big a chest as his, and does he wear a bra. Many sequences and/or related dialogue involve discussion of threats to children, and at times, children being held at gunpoint, or threatened. The kids (even the baby) are guarded at one point by a very nasty terrorist with a gun. Shane finds the oldest daughter Zoe sitting outside on an upper-level patio, and cautions ""Even a rookie sniper could drop you like a deer."" You would know best if your kids can handle it, but sometimes I'm surprised what goes into a ""PG"" movie. From my perspective, this one's safe for the kiddos.

GOOD: (""Good"" in this case means anything positive that attracted me about the movie, and/or provided redeeming values) Shane may be a tough Navy SEAL, but he's all heart. He begins by instilling discipline in the family, albeit under protest from the kids. Shane eventually realizes that while discipline is needed, the kids also need a friend, and he winds up stepping in to take that role. He steps in to ward off Zoe's jerky boyfriend, which she initially resents, but soon appreciates the wisdom of. He helps train Lulu and her Girl Scout troop in self-defense against the swaggering eight-year-old Boy Scout bullies. He puts his own life in danger several times to protect Mrs. Plummer, and the children. The kids hate his military ways, but gradually accept, then love him. The movie's overall emphasis on how hard Shane's job is (replacing both mother AND father) is a welcome tip of the hat to the toughest job in the world; stay-at-home Mom.

THOUGHTS: Tough guys taking over family duties is nothing new, but movie-goers haven't seen any (that I know of) which also deals with terrorists. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and if you're looking for a good Friday night movie for the whole family, Pacifier's a good one to watch.

DVD CONTENT: The extras are shockingly dismal, but I suppose the movie was more character-based than effects-based. The small scope of interviews and behind-the-scene clips (one featurette about how Vin Diesel is actually a nice guy, one about Brad Garrett, some surprisingly UN-funny bloopers, some cut scenes without any explanation behind them and a small selection of previews) plus an absence of easter eggs all demonstrate that Hollywood needs to have separate behind-the-scenes crews to make the DVD extras. (Perhaps the team from Lord of the Rings)",1120780800,,4392,4.92972972972973

2282156,3,B0009DWL96,"Vin Diesel is really good in this film. He does a good job at being tough, but he is also sentinmental at the same time. One fight he does in the middle of the film is done well, and a scene where he talks to the oldest girl about her dad is great. I was worried that the movie was going to be entirely comical when the grandma lady kept shooting off wisecracks. She leaves early in the movie though, so that's good. Aside from that, the movie just isn't that funny or enjoyable.

Part of the problem with this film is that I was able to guess everything. I guessed who the bad guy was, and I was right. I guessed what would happen to Vin at the end, and I was right. I knew that Vin would come into the house and the kids would dislike him but they would grow to like him.

The other problem with the film is the changes to the people. By the end of the movie, everyone knows kung fu. The principal learns it, the kids learn it, and even the mom who was in the movie for about 10 minutes learned kung fu somehow. At the end, the kids are able to beat Jeet Kun Do masters by watching Vin Diesel. The girl scouts somehow master complex maneuvers in a matter of minutes. It just makes the movie seem too stupid.

If you like Vin Diesel, I would suggest you rent this movie. This movie didn't make me laugh once, so I wouldn't suggest buying it.",1120608000,,1342,4.056603773584905

However, I will criticize it for its lack of originality. This has all been done before in other movies. It borrowed a lot from the movie ""Major Payne"" (a way superior movie) plus it had stuff from other movies like Mr. mom, and home alone. The characters in the movie also have no depth, they are very superficial. They were pretty much there just to be there. It's a movie you will watch and then never watch again. It is definitely a movie not too many adults are going to repeatedly watch. It just lacked ideas. However, it did make my son laugh several times. So from a kids perspective, I guess it's not all that bad, even though I didn't care for it.

Side Note: I actually have a bone to pick with Disney: I am so sick of Disney's subjective censorship in their movies. They are hypocrites! Let me explain: I watched the new ""where the red fern grows"" and Disney took it upon itself to edit all the gun fire out of the movie (and it's a movie about hunting), they edited all the violence to the point that you have to rewind the movie a couple times to make heads are tales out of a bad editing scene where a boy dies. They also edited the violence out of the dog fighting with the mountain lion scene; it was so bad that it actually looks like a stuffed animal fight. So Disney likes to edit out any thing it finds ""questionable"" or ""offensive, YET IN THIS MOVIE, Disney found it ""ok"" to encourage children to fight, be violent, and setup traps that could actually kill someone. Disney also found it ""ok"" that this movie uses terms like ""boobs"" (repeatedly) and uses a wrestling move term called a ""nipple crippler"" these are terms taken straight from this movie. I'm not a conservative or a prude, as a matter of fact, I have a potty mouth, and I am an anti-censorship supporter. I just find Disney to be a little stupid and hypocritical when it comes to what they approve of in their movies.

I think he's hilarious and as good an actor as most in Hollywood today.  I went to see this movie opening weekend at a 10:00 PM oclock showing and there were probably only 4 or 5 other people there.  We laughed until tears were coming down our faces and we could barely breathe.

""The Pacifier"" is not Vin Diesel's most action packed or funny movie, but it is one of his most enjoyable.  Seeing a man that huge get along with little children and make friends out of a family that really needs a father figure was actually touching and Vin pulls it off pretty well.  While many of the jokes are aimed at small children (this movie is rated PG afterall) many of them are still humorous to those of us over 10 years old.  Throw in Lauren Graham who is always the scene stealer, no matter what you put her in, and this movie really is fun to watch with kids, by yourself, or with all your grownup friends.

Is the plot far-fetched?  Yes.  At times it's even idiotic and pointless, but anyone watching this movie for an ""English Patient"" calibur plot is obviously in the wrong place.

Mr. Diesel opted to do ""Pacifier"" because he'd have the opportunity to make a film that his children could watch and enjoy with him--unlike his previous releases which he considered too violent.

Surprise, ""Pacifier"" isn't just for kids.  While there is a ""family feel"" to the film, there's enough action and suspense to keep the adults on the edge of their seats.  Besides, the whole film is surprisingly funny as well.

Vin Diesel stars as a Special Ops soldier who lost a famous scientist on a mission.  When he's assigned to guard the scientists' children while their mother is away, Diesel is triply determined to make sure the kids are safe.  The children pose their own problems:  the son dresses as a Nazi (turns out he's secretly gotten a part in ""Sound of Music""), the daughter is having problems learning to drive, the baby just really doesn't know what's happening.  Everyone's traumatized by the loss of their father--and having such a rough-and-ready guardian is hard on all of them.  But, they band together when the family's at risk.

If you have seen the trailers at the movies or the ads on TV, you know you're getting a movie tough guy (Vin Diesel), playing against type as a reluctant softie (a la KINDERGARTEN COP).  He bonds with a bunch of kids, we enjoy some obvious diaper jokes, and watch as the kids go from hating him to loving him.  Meanwhile, some well-known television actors eagerly add movie credits to their resumes in thankless roles.  We laugh about 10 times, walk out, and immediately forget it.

If you walk IN expecting more, I feel sorry for you.  There was nothing deceptive about the marketing.  It properly lowers expectations.

I won't rehash the plot (again, the previews pretty much give it to you).  Vin Diesel gamely assails the role of hard-hearted guy melted by those weaker than him (see ARE WE THERE YET or MAN OF THE HOUSE for VERY recent examples).  He really isn't much of an actor, but he does manage a few cute reactions to the shenanigans of the kids.  He gets to use his military training to try to whip the kids into shape, with predictably silly results.  Poor Vin, I think he peaked with PITCH BLACK, became famous with FAST AND THE FURIOUS, and has been on a downward spiral ever since.  The box office success of this movie should in no way be an indication that his career is revitalized.  It's unlikely he could get away with a similar role again...how many times can he make fun of his persona when no one cares that much about his persona in the first place?

It's all mindless, and pointless.  The kids have recently lost their father, and yet they seem to show no grief.  Yeah, the act out a little bit around Vin, but it doesn't seem to be anything worse than a little teen peevishness.  When they finally believe their lives are in danger, they change their behavior by being a little nicer to Vin.  Do they stay home and away from activities?  No!  Do they perhaps even stay home from school for a day or two?  Nope.  We buy absolutely none of it.

Faith Ford (TV personality trying a movie role) is completely wasted in the mother role.  She has no personality, nothing funny to do...zip.  Lauren Graham (GILMORE GIRLS) is the school principal, and we see brief flashes of charisma, but basically, the role is a device.  She's certainly better in BAD SANTA. And Brad Garrett (EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND), as the villainous wrestling coach, is a one-dimensional character whose comeuppance is not as fun as it should have been.

The only surprising thing in the movie were some clumsy but still amusing scenes related to THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  I don't want to say more, because if you see it, you will be amused.  Didn't expect musical theater jokes, did you?

It's a movie for the family, but only if your family has no other viewing options.  I didn't really HATE the movie, but there's nothing to love either.",1118880000,,2898,4.532818532818533

Good bouncer, sure, but on the silver screen, he made Ashton Kutcher look like Lawrence Olivier. ""DUH!!... UH!!!... ME GON BEAT YOU UP!!!!!!!!"" Which would be a typical brain-dead line from Mr. Diesel. So when this revelation was revealed, did Mr. Diesel silently admit defeat?

Nope.

Enter: THE PACIFIER!!!

When will this guy just stop? How many more of these dumb movies is he gonna make? About two more Vin Diesel movies and America's IQ will start to go down. Eventually we'll end up back in the primordial soup while he grunts his way to the bank. Oy Vey Ist Mir. The problem is, because of his large size, apparently no one wants to tell him to his face that he can't act. This is why he's not flipping burgers at your local Hardee's, ladies and gentlemen.

I  think that it was quite a big move for Vin.  From the upcoming films that he had chosen, I can see he's looking for different characters instead of action hero.  Just like what he said, you can't be Riddick forever at the age of 50.  A real actor will try a different characters and plays..

Personally, I have seen almost all Vin's movies (apart from multi-face) but it's all violence and sex things, therefore really can't imagine that he's playing well in Disney Movie...

2282249,4,B0009DWL96,"The funniest scene in this movie was where the little girl asks Vin if ""My chest will get as big as yours?"" The dumbstricken look on his face, and the wild desire to hide is quite apparent on Vin. Other than that, there's not much here to keep adults laughing, but the younger generation should be pleased with their taste of Vin. Even the towel scene was designed for children in mind, and while being amusing to them, its going to leave us rather disappointed.

Disney certainly did all they could to turn the heat off in this movie, making the sexy lug from the hits such as Pitch Black, Riddick and the fast and the furius turning into a complete nurse maid. Even learing the 'Panda Dance' where we get to hear and see Vin show us that he certainly didn't become famous for his ability to sing and dance. But like I said, its a moment for children, and they seem to enjoy it.

Armed with Diapers, bottles and germ infectants, Vin carries his S.W.A.T habits into the real world, and contrives to look undercover and tough even when hoisting a baby on his hip, and cleaning up after a duck that thinks its a dog. He's every mothers dream ,and every babies nightmare.

The romance in this movie is also toned down as he falls in love with the high school principle, and becomes a stage director. Its rather funny to think of after seeing the steamy scenes from The Fast and the Furious that it becomes quite comical to Vin's character and style. He just doesn't seem the type to date someone so mild. But this is Disney, and there are rules to follow. (Sigh)

On summing up, don't look for anything wild or exciting, unless its evading a laser field or teaching a teen to drive a van. However if you're looking for a pretty decent family film this is a winner.

2282252,3,B0009DWL96,"Starting Plot-----

Lt. Shane Wolfe (VIN DIESEL) is a Navy SEAL who's been trained to deal with most any situation he might encounter while serving his country. He rescued Howard Plummer (TATE DONOVAN), a kidnapped government scientist When Shane lets down his guard by allowing Howard to call home, the scientist is assassinated.

Two months later, after Shane heals from a `battle wound', he is ready to reassume SEAL duties, but Capt. Bill Fawcett (CHRIS POTTER) informs him of a new mission. While Fawcett accompanies Howard's widow, Julie (FAITH FORD), to open a safety deposite box overseas, Shane must watch Julie's kids while search for a computer program. He must keep the kids safe, basically. Considering his background and the fact that the family's nanny, Helga (CAROL KANE), is still there, Shane figures this will be an easy assignment. He is wrong.

Zoe (BRITTANY SNOW) and Seth (MAX THIERIOT) Lulu (MORGAN YORK) and Peter (KEEGAN & LOGAN HOOVER), and Baby Tyler's (BO AND LUKE VINK) are the kids, and they are quite a handful, even for a SEAL. The kids make life extra hard for Shane.

Character Development----

I think that character development, as well as the plot, is what really made this movie a let down. There wasn't any. First one thing's happening and then the other, without much background. For example (this might 'ruin' the ending, so please skip) the two Korean neighors are shown in one-two scenes until the end of the movie. Two people break into the house at one point. At the end of the movie, (in the safe beneath the garage) the two criminals who broke into the house are shown to be the neighbors who are Korean spies. There is no foreshadowing.

While Vin Diesil does a fair job to fit the role of the SEAL, there is little to compare this too.

It is a 'family' movie, though there is a decent amount of crude/rude humor that should be taken into effect.",1113696000,,1896,4.7272727272727275
2282253,2,B0009DWL96,"Vin Diesel stars as LT Shawn Wolfe, Navy seal, in this Disney family feature.  Boy, have you seen this storyline time and time again.  It's your typical fish-out-of-the-water scenario, where a Navy seal (Diesel) is placed in a situation that he is not ""comfortable or suited"" (i.e. care provider of five kids).

The movie opens with LT Wolfe on a search and rescue mission, in which, he blotches.  The victim is killed, and Wolfe is injured.  The film fast-forwards two months, Wolfe has fully recovered and back on the mission; however, there's one small exception, he must now ensure the safety of the Plummer children.  Dr. Plummer, who was killed earlier in the film, has developed the ""GHOST"" program which can prevent foreigner threats from launching their nuclear armaments by changing their launch codes.  The only problem is that no one knows where the program has been hidden.  Wolfe's secondary mission is to search the Plummer house as well providing security.

As in all these films, Wolfe struggles initially; however, by the end of the film, everything always seems to work out.  I found the film totally redundant and less than amusing; however, I'm not twelve.  The film has gross $100 million plus domestically, so obviously someone likes this film.

2282254,5,B0009DWL96,"The Pacifier is one of those movies that starts off a little slow but really delivers in the end.  The beginning of the film makes the viewer wonder how we will ever be drawn into caring about the well being of the cast, then suddenly, we are.  I found myself really drawn to the family that Vin Diesel was protecting from the bad guys.  The entire cast was convincing and funny.  Since my daughter is just learning how to drive, I found the parts with the teenage girl learning how to drive hilarious.  But overall, the movie delivers a little bit of everything.

  Vin Diesel is the John Wayne of today.  In a lot of his movies he stands up for what is right even when everyone around him is following the wrong path.  He makes a good hero simply because his visual expressions are fantastic when it comes to showing shock at others bad behavior.  We just can't wait for him to slap the ""bad guy"" around and explain to him how stupid he is!  In this movie shows quite a few bad guys the error of their ways.  And he even teaches some Girl Scouts how to defend themselves against a group of cookie-crushing bad-boy scouts.

  Is the plot in this movie too simple?  You betchya'.  Is this movie still a fun ride with a cast that seemed to be having a blast on the set?  You betchya!  Disney made a great choice picking Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast.  I laughed, and yeah, I admit it, I even cried, but just for a second.  I think the butter on the popcorn got in my eyes.

  I realize the critics will eat this movie alive.  And that's one reason I'm glad critics don't make movies.  A simple script can be made into an amazing movie when the acting rises above and beyond what is required.  Watching this film reminded me of the old Disney movies that though about entertaining the entire American family, not just a select group of movie-goers.

  I hope the director, cast, and crew, get to see this review, because I want to say thanks for making my family smile, laugh, and cry together.  Even if mine was because I had butter in my eyes.

2282255,5,B0009DWL96,"To me, Vin Diesel is one of those actors who I enjoy watching no matter what film he does; be it macho men with glowing eyes...yummy...or a Navy S.E.A.L. in a Disney movie with a predictable beginning and end.

I happen to adore many Disney movies.  I don't care how predictable they are.  I knew this would be a happy, funny movie.  In these days, families, especially with young children, need to be able to see a movie full of positive messages.

I love Vin Diesel and while Lt. Shane Wolfe is the complete polar opposite of Riddick, I was not bored.  I enjoy seeing actors take a step back from what they usually do and explore other characters.  There are many similarities too.  They're both tough and nobody can beat them up.

I also enjoy seeing a man suddenly thrust into a world with children, diapers, and soccer-mom minivans.  It's hilarious when they have to do the Mr. Mom thing.  Oh, and seriously, the Peter Panda Dance Vin does for the little boy is absolutely worth it!  I was giggling, but really having fun.

All in all, Vin is one of my favorite actors and I like him even more now.  In fact, I'd never seen Pitch Black or The Chronicles of Riddick until after I'd seen The Pacifier.  That Disney movie made me want to see more of his acting.  Plus, the muscles are a very nice touch indeed.  ;)

2282266,3,B0009DWL96,"First off, this movie deserves a 2.5 from my point of view. Here's why...

Good stuff

1) This movie is cute and entertaining. Vin Diesel does a decent job with his role as Lt. Shane Wolf. There are moments that are very endearing and tender, moments with the kids when Vin shines and shows potential to be an actor that could pull off and headline a character-driven movie.

2) There is a martial arts fight with rather impressive stunts and moves that somehow took me out of the Disney element and forced me to take notice. Granted this happens in the middle of the movie when I was trying my hardest to care about the kids.

3) This movie was funnier than I thought it would be. Originally the combination of Disney and Vin Diesel didn't seem like it would work very well, but it was still funny.

Bad stuff

1) Why does this family have five children? It seemed there was a 10-15 minute scene devoted to each child. Not really enough to really develop a real character, if you ask me. One could argue this was just a way to extend this movie to at least an hour and a half long.

2) (As a result of #1 above) I can't really bring myself to care about these characters, save ""Shane""/Vin.

3) Vin Diesel seemed out of his element. As much as he did a decent job, and as much as his character demanded he BE out of his element, he didn't seem 100% comfortable with the role. Perhaps he was hoping there would be more explosions and action for the character to face.

Overall, this is a decent movie. A definite rental, but it certainly won't be added to my DVD collection.",1112140800,,1573,4.305084745762712

He needs to stick with the action movies.  This movie was horribly cliched, after the first 10 minutes I knew pretty much how the rest of the movie would lay out.  It was poorly scripted and the acting felt like it was forced out.  The whole ""Hollywood tough guy trying to be family friendly"" has been played out.  It was okay with Arnold, when Hulk Hogan tried to repeat it, it wasn't as good, with Vin it just isn't worth the try.

2282269,5,B0009DWL96,"Initially, before watching this movie, I was unsure as to whether I would enjoy it or not, depending on Vin Diesel's performance. However, after watching this movie, I found it very entertaining, and was glad that I saw it.

The story starts off with Lt. Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) and his team trying to rescue Dr. Plummer, a scientist who is being held hostage by Bosnian terrorists for inventing some kind of a new gadget GHOST. Shane succeeds in saving Dr. Plummer, but something happens in the last minute, because of which Plummer is killed. After a few days, Shane is given a new assignment: to guard Plummer's children (since the bad guys are still searching for the GHOST program and suspect that it could be in the Plummer house)  while his widow (Faith Ford) goes to Zurich to reclaim possessions of her husband. Shane hates taking care of the children in the beginning, especially after the maid Helga runs away, but soon, things change, and he starts becoming closer to them.

The movie is a little slow during the first few minutes, but quickly picks up when Vin Diesel starts babysitting the Plummer children. Even though we know how the movie is going to turn out eventually (since it's a Walt Disney one), it is nevertheless, still fun to watch Vin Diesel take on a different role from his usual stuff, and show a different side of himself. Along with that, various scenes in this movie were hilarious, some of them which were: (a) when Shane changes the diaper on the baby for the first time (b) the way Helga leaves the house in the beginning leaving Shane to do all the housework (c) The wrestling match between Shane and the Vice Principal, and (d) The way the girl scouts get back at their nemesis for messing up their cookies. Acting-wise, I think everyone acted well for their role, especially the kids. Lauren Graham played her role well, even though she didn't have much of one, and Brad Garrett, of course, is highly entertaining to watch and played his part well.

Overall, this movie has a little something for everyone, and it succeeds in delivering what it intended to do: providing a good family comedy.",1111017600,,2133,4.664893617021277
2282270,2,B0009DWL96,"I'm trying to look at this from a perspective of a family film. I didn't enjoy it too much, but then again I am a 24 year old without children.

My first problem with the movie is that the father of the family dies in the opening sequence, leaving a widow and a family without a father. Vin Diesel is supposed to watch over the family while the mother goes out of town to open the dead father's lock box and find out what he left behind. Right after the father's death, we see the family and they don't seem to be very bothered by the death. In fact, with the exception of a COUPLE of scenes, the father isn't really mentioned (other than the fact that he created this ghost system the bad guys really want). It seems that his death was just so we could have hilarity involving a Navy Seal out of water story. And that kind of bothers me. I just don't see a family bouncing back so quickly; it almost appears as if the father doesn't matter except that it pushes the story along.

The other mainstay of the movie is it's continual feces-based jokes. Whether its Vin Diesel diving in sewer water and emerging feces-soaked, Vin Diesel changing diapers (with tools no less), Vin Diesel diving into a ball pen to retrieve a dirty diaper, and other assorted fart jokes, the movie is filled with cliched poop.

One comic area that actually worked for me was Helga, the Transylvanian accented help maid (after falling downstairs, another joke) who ends up leaving early. There were a few more areas that were pretty funny, but overall it's been done before in children comedy and done much better.

This movie is like a 21st century Kindergarten Cop. Except Kindergarten Cop was more funny (and I didn't care too much for it either). All said, it was mildly entertaining, and judging from the current films out there right now it's probably one of the better family films out. Just not as good as I was hoping. Maybe a little less poop jokes and more funny would have helped",1110844800,,1967,4.455555555555556

It was a great movie that I will actually tell people to go and see this movie.  I honestly didn't have extreme high hopes for this movie because of all the duds I have seen lately but this movie is one movie that stands at the top of my list!  It is one you will laugh to and that the kids will enjoy.  It is especially a great movie if you have a family and want to take them to the movies as they will enjoy it.  I think everyone in the movie clicked well and made it for an exciting trip.  I loved the kids the most they were just cute and I liked the chemistry that Vin had with the kids you could tell he was enjoying his work and he was put into the role perfectly.  This is a sure winner for him!  If you like to laugh and want a funny movie that is actually clean and doesn't resort to low jokes you will love this movie.",1110758400,,990,3.8374384236453203

Vin Diesel really made a wise career choice in deciding to make a Comedy his next film. And he does an excellant job portraying a Navy SEAL who is required to guard a family of children while their mother is away. Not only that, but he looks very sexy holding a baby. What is it about caring for a baby that

makes a man look extremely attractive... The scenes he has with the Firefly Girl Scout troupe are hysterical, and very cute.

Carol Kane is also outstanding as the foreign Nanny - what a great character actress she is. This woman simply needs to be in more movies.

2282304,4,B0009DWL96,"The Pacifier (Adam Shankman, 2005)

Shankman (A Walk to Remember) takes a number of different, rather tired ideas here and actually whips them into something that's surprisingly worth watching, at least on a few levels. You've got the single-male-raising-kids thing from Three Men and a Baby (including, yes, the diaper-changing scene), you've got the buddy-cop thing, you've got the international-intrigue thing, you've got the romantic-entanglement thing, you've got... well, all sorts of things. It all works relatively well, surprisingly.

Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel of Pitch Black fame) is a Navy SEAL who's been laid up in the hospital after a snatch-and-grab went bad, resulting in the death of its target, Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan, presently in The O.C.). Upon his release from the hospital, Wolfe is informed that the project Plummer was working on is still MIA, but that it might be in a safety deposit box in Switzerland. Plummer's wife (Faith Ford of Murphy Brown) and Wolfe's boss (Chris Potter of Wild Card) are off to Switzerland to get the box, and Wolfe is left to look after Plummer's five kids. Cue hilarity.

Yeah, it's predictable, and you've seen all these jokes before. Under the surface, however, Shankman is doing a very good job of connecting all those things mentioned above into one coherent narrative, and he does it very well. There is some good attention to detail paid in the movie, and it all sets up rather like a game of Mousetrap (for those of you old enough to remember the game Mousetrap, anyway). It's stupid, but it's fun, and surprisingly enough, it does contain a few surprises. Fun stuff, worth a rental. *** ",1110412800,,1653,4.978260869565218
2282305,3,B0009DWL96,"The Pacifier has a lot of fake action, particularly at the beginning and during fighting scenes.  Besides action, other fake things include a trap door in the garage floor that no one knew about; a high US military person secretly working for North Korea.  There was lots of gun scenes but no shooting.

Okay, now for the good parts: Vin Diessel does some silly dancing, and really just makes a fool of himself babysitting 5 kids.  He has to take them to school, to the grocery store; all while acting like he is still a S.E.A.L.

So there!"" method, [vid -S*O*B- or -Victor, Victoria-] or the Ahhnuld method [as in -Kindergarten Cop-].  The Rock uses Robert Preston hilariously in -Be Cool-.  Vin Diesel ... does less OK in -The Pacifier-.

Sure, he's great w/the kids - i esp. loved his way of teaching Zoe to drive  & Lulu to stand up as a proud Firefly - but there's little more than that to recommend this ""Ooooh, lookit the Tough Movie Star bond w/children"".  It's nice to see him being non-judgmental about the son's desire to be in a musical.  But his ""Ewww! Red Baby!"" schtick is *soooo* overdone.

The movie was ""very cool"" for the kids, of course they loved it.  But, it was even comical enough for my boyfriend and I to sit through it without looking at our watches even once - even though the plot was predictible at times.  I actually thought it was a good movie, and came out happy.  There are plenty of funny scenes in the movie that weren't spoiled by previews of the movie.  My favorite was when Vin Diesel's character was forced to do a humiliating dance in order to get one of the five kids to go to sleep every night.

2282330,4,B0009DWL96,"I have to say the first time I saw a ad for this movie all I could think about was ""Good Heavens, not another Hulk Hogan-Suburban Commando flick"". However, having been dragged to this I was pleasently surprised. Although the plot is hokey, predictable, and downright silly at times there are many things to like about this picture.

First of all, Vin Diesel really isn't that bad of an actor. He tends sometimes to seem out of place in a comedy but then again, the whole plot is about him being out of place, so it works. The rest of the cast is quite good. Second, the humor, while being hit-&-miss at times, was more hit than miss. For once, all the funny scenes were not included in the TV ads. Third, and to me one of the most important, the director & writers never had to resort to ""bathroom"" humor. No dirty-mouth little kids, no body noises (except when it came to the baby, of course). Just good semi-solid humor. It made for an enjoyable movie-going experience for me & my daughter. Who could ask for more?

I would stongly recomment this to any family looking for a good comedy that can be appreciated by both children and adults. As I said, the plot's a wee-bit predictable but still enjoyable for all",1110067200,,1213,4.434977578475336

2282333,3,B0009DWL96,"Every once in a while, the movie industry does something so weird that you are forced to wonder what was going on the day some executive okayed the idea.  Was the L. A. smog particular poisonous or something?  For the most part, these bizarre movie ideas (example: ""Hey!  Let's make ANOTHER movie about an enchanted racing Volkswagen Beetle!"") turn out to be total duds, but every so often, these crazy plots actually turn into something remotely resembling a good movie.  Such is the case here, where tough action star Vin Diesel is thrown into a silly family comedy.

 On the surface, ""The Pacifier"" seems like a really dumb idea: Putting an action movie tough guy in charge of a bunch of kids in a goofy family movie.  And deep down, it is.  But for whatever reason, it works- occasionally.

 Shane Wolfe (Diesel) is a hard-edged Navy SEAL who is tasked with protecting the family of a (now-murdered) scientist from those who would try to hurt them.  It seems this scientist invented some kind of ballistic missile scrambler, which all manner of nasty types want for themselves.  What, exactly, is with Disney's fascination with ingenious scientists who invent truly incredible things, but live in normal American suburbia?  Isn't there one of those in nearly every Disney action/comedy ever made?  Anyway, as is completely expected, Wolfe is left to fend for himself, while the scientist's widow heads for Geneva to, yes, get into his safe deposit box which contains, supposedly, the vital technology.  She's only supposed to be gone for a couple of days, but it turns out to be more like several weeks, because (this is so pathetic) she can't guess the password to access the deposit box.  You'd think after about, I don't know, a day or so of guessing wrong passwords, the bank people would toss her out.

 So, Wolfe must take care of a rather large clan of kids, including a boy-crazy teenage girl, a surly teenage boy, an irresistibly cute little girl, a couple of younglings, and for no apparent reason: a duck.  And just like that, (that was the intent anyway), hilarity ensues.  To be honest, there are some pretty funny moments here, but nothing too spectacular.  Mostly it's just an overabundance of diaper humor, a given when dealing with several young kids, but enough is enough.  No need to be disgusting.  It was pretty amusing to see the rigidly-trained SEAL trying to deal with a bunch of unruly kids on his militaristic terms, even when it was stuff like Girl Scouts.  One of the funnier moments is Vin Diesel getting ready to take the kids out by wearing baby bottles like grenades and juice boxes like ammo cartridges.

 What I found most interesting however, was that there actually was a sufficient amount of action in this family comedy.  You can't completely take Vin Diesel away from the fight.  The opening credits sequence had enough explosions and guns going off to get MY attention.  And during the movie proper, there are some incredible chase scenes; incredible because they involve a Toyota mini-van.

""The Pacifier"" is a good effort, but what it really needs to do is grow up.",1109980800,,3111,4.793233082706767
2282334,3,B0009DWL96,"I love Vin Diesel, I am willing to pay $10 to see him in any movie, especially a comedy. Even though this was a Disney movie, it was worth the almost 2 hours in the movie theater. The plot was pretty predictable, but it was mindless fun, especially seeing Vin being a comedic actor. I thought the kids were cute, the scenes with poopy diapers and the fireflies troop are cute too. All in all I enjoyed it, and will buy it on dvd when it comes out. Thanks for the laughs, Vin!!!",1109980800,,477,4.139784946236559
2282335,2,B0009DWL96,"A bag of Skittles and a 20-oz bottle of water later, I still ask myself why? Oh, yeah, the answer to all the unsolved mysteries of the world, my Mother wanted to see the movie. So, like the dutiful daughter I am I escorted my Mother to the movie.

To say this movie is a departure for Vin Diesel is an understatement. Vin Diesel, the star of Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick, and XXX, making a Disney film? My goodness the raciest scene in the movie was Vin Diesel bare chested with a towel wrapped around his waist. Okay, that was a great scene. Actually, it was the best scene, he's YUMMY.

Anyway, the movies cute. Yeah, I said cute. How could it not be you've got cute kids who don't need supervision and Vin Diesel ready to supervise with lots of physical comedy and scenes with diaper poop. That's comedy right?

Okay, it's a family movie that you can take your kids and your Mother to see and not squirm when the sex scenes begin and not one dirty word to make you gasp. There is some limited violence but it's definitely PG violence. So, if you want to go out and take Mom or the kids see this movie but don't expect Oscar Award material because if you do, you'll be disappointed.

Oh, my mother wanted you to know there's a duck in the movie she thought was cute, too.

There wasn't a single clip I couldn't stop laughing about. He jumps into a ball-pool and digs up a dirty diaper while coming out for air. He uses military combat stories for bedtime tales. To avoid being late for school, Vin drives 50 mph and still manages to parallel park all because the daughter says we're gonnna be late and he replies ""Not on my watch"". And Robert, from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", goes through college wrestling with Diesel.
