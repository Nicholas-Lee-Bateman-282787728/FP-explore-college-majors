Definetly working with unknown parrots here and definetly shows the use of food as a training re-enforcer.  For an overall touch on training techniques I found it very helpful but really needed more in depth for certain issues (such as agression or bitting).

Good Luck!",1343174400,4,884,4.664516129032258
