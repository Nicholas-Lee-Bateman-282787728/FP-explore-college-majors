One thing about the movie I didn't like was that Indy was much more Han Solo-like than in  the others.

128401,4,0792157850,"Recently watched ""Temple"" BEFORE ""Raiders"" to see how viewing the series in in-universe chronological order would affect my experience of each film---as well, of course, to get what I consider to be the lesser film out of the way. The new viewing order enhanced my enjoyment of this one considerably. It's still the most strident, ridiculous, and racially insensitive of the bunch (they all are; I love them, but let's be honest), but as an entry point to the series, it works well. Minus the expectations created by ""Raiders,"" Willie Scott's performance of ""Anything Goes"" sets a fresh tone that's easier to go along with over the next two hours.

128437,1,0792157850,"Literally. Not that this franchise is supposed to be a heavy hitter, but this is by far the weakest effort, without any of the charm or wit that is embodied in the other Indies.

When the film doesn't offer up characters, even the cute 12 year old side kick with a bad case of hero worship, that you give a damn about, you know things are sad.

Honestly, just skip it. Watch one of the other Indie films twice, you will have more fun!",1504828800,,434,4.154761904761905
128438,5,0792157850,"I'm a person who generally leans toward the original films of a franchise more so than the sequel, but there are exceptions, in particular in this case. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) is the best film of the franchise to me. It's the one I watch on repeat repeatedly. Fast-paced, chock full of action, humor, wit, charm, and heart, not only is it my favorite Indy film, it's one of my favorite Steven Spielberg films. And what's alarming to me is how many people don't even rank this as the 2nd best Indy flick! I think a lot of fans actually believe that the 1989 film 'The Last Crusade', an overrated, cheesy-looking, dated, humorless, pretentious, poorly acted, boring exercise and test on my patience, is the 2nd best film, or dare I even say it, the best one! That flick is nothing more than a re-hash of the original film 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', replete with Nazis and world-changing biblical artifact.

Actually a prequel to 'Raiders', 'Temple of Doom' is set in 1935 and starts off with a slam bang musical number 'Anything Goes' in a fancy Hong Kong nightclub where our hero Dr. Indiana Jones (excellently played by film icon Harrison Ford in probably my all-time favorite performance of his) squares off against a prominent Chinese gangster over a precious diamond and as chaos ensues in a wild action sequence of the club patrons barreling out of the nightclub, Indy makes his escape along with Willie Scott (wonderfully played in scene-stealing fashion by Kate Capshaw), an American entertainer who sang the opening number. Along with Willie, accompanying Indy is his sidekick Short Round (funny performance by then child actor Jonathan Ke Quan). I'll never understand how people thought Willie and Short Round were annoying in this flick, when Capshaw and Quan displayed wonderful comic timing and actually had believable chemistry with Harrison Ford. It was like following the adventures of a fractured family and this trio as the heart of the film really makes it work, all their interactions feeling natural and heartwarming. I honestly thought Ford had a more believable family bond with Short Round than with Sean Connery as his Dad in 'Crusade', which I thought reeked of Hollywood one-liners.

After a narrow escape from their abandoned plane on a life raft, they fall into a wild river in India and make their way to a village where the leader indicates all of the local children have been kidnapped by a malevolent occult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri in a vigorous, wide-eyed, scary performance), who is holed up at the luxurious Pangkot Palace. The trio makes their way to the palace and get into the thick of things immediately as Indy investigates and finds that the palace royalty is in cahoots with the cult leader and finds Mola Ram's base of operations in the cavernous structures beneath the palace. The adventure ensues as Indy tries to stop Mola Ram and save the children from being cult sacrifices.

A huge reason that 'Temple of Doom' stands out for me over all other Indy films is that there is no let up. The movie starts out with that entertaining musical number, moves straight into the action and never lets go. The dialogue is crisp, the humor still fresh, the action scenes still hold up due to very limited, if any, CGI, and the performances are energetic. 'Raiders' has always felt like a bunch of nicely staged set pieces to me that add up to an entertaining film, while 'Crusade' is just awful. But 'Temple' feels right, the most fluid of all the Indy flicks with the best ending. Spielberg does a great job of balancing several elements: action, horror, the occult, romance, family drama, and meshes all these into a film that will forever be entertaining.",1504483200,2,3718,4.797191887675507

I watched it again in Amazon Prime to make sure and, yup, my memory serves me well.  Despite its high budget and top-notch star, this is one of the worst movies ever made.  We spent the entire time just wanting it to be over with.  After it was released in theaters, we were not surprised to see that critics universally panned it.  Yet, we see incredibly high ratings on Amazon.  Easy to explain.

At least now, based on the ratings and assuming they pay full price for the Amazon Prime accounts for their sock puppets, we can see that Disney spends at least $100, 000 per year for accounts to game the ratings, plus whatever they pay their writers for gushy reviews of movies they own.

It is like a satanist horror film, but they got away with no R rating because they portrayed Indians rather than westerners.  Nice.

And let's think about the obnoxious stereotypes. What would people say if Christianity were cast in this light? Pulling the hearts out of people? Hindus actually worship Kali, their worship is nothing like this, and the representation of the god is nothing like this. It is pretty grotesque when you stop and think about it.  As for the others, the Willie role is terrible: she does nothing but whine and scream, and she's not particularly good at it. Short Round is cute at first but gets annoying.

You increase the volume to full level on Amazon and on your viewing device, as well,  and the sound is still hard to hear to pick up, more particularly the voices of the actors, especially, Kate Capshaw's voice.  This is distracting.  Straining to hear what they are saying is annoying.  I am not hard of hearing.  Usually, the movies from Amazon, at full volume are too loud, unless you are in another room and just want to hear the audio.  Not so with this flick.  Just letting you know.  Amazon needs to have enough volume that we, the viewer control it, not Amazon.  Yes, very distracting. You listen to Amazon music and you can get enough volume to shake the house.

This is a very dark film compared to this others by far but there was also a great ending filled with hope. Indiana Jones chosen by a good god from another religion was just so original compared to the others.
There were a few mistakes, Alligators down at the bottom of the river instead of Crocodiles as an example. But this film is just amazing and my personal favorite. I have had some people tell me they hated the dark nature of this film and even liked Crystal Skull better, but that is just bitter crazy talk.
I liked the fact there were two side kicks, and both were very original. One a sissy showgirl and the other a wise cracking kids found on the streets during a World War. The annoying aspect of Willie's personality was on point and Short Round was perfect. I never considered them annoying.
The other two films are great as well of course and I don't consider Indiana Jones Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a Indiana Jones movie.
This easily makes my top 20 movies of all time and still holds up today, I can watch this film a few times a month and never get bored.",1487289600,2,1361,4.3203125

Temple of Doom has a grear Story Arc because this story omits Nazis in place of the Acult in India during Colonialism which is truly fascinating. My only gripe with this movie is the Inflatable raft out of the Cargo Plane is so cheesy and rediculous that I feel Lucas/Spielberg could've avoided it.",1484697600,,544,4.3861386138613865

129861,3,0792157850,"Nearly every second that Cupshaw's character isn't speaking (or really doing anything) it is a great movie. The character of Willie ruins it in many ways, however. I always get a headache from her screaming, and I hate how pathetic and stereotypical of a character she is. Yet at the same time I'm always biting my nails as Indy fights through the temple in the dark story.

The film has a lot of upside. It is very suspenseful and unpredictable. The dark plot itself was unexpected. Yet at the same time it still has some of the charm from the first movie.

On the downside, Willie is a ridiculous character that is completely impossible to connect to. Every scene she is in destroys the magic of storytelling that makes the viewer feel like a part of the story because we all know that her character is unrealistic. She is unpredictable in the sense that her actions don't make sense and are just frustrating to watch.

Overall, I think it is worth the watch if you think you can look past the weakness of a ridiculously stereotypical female character. If you think that will bother you, skip to Last Crusade. The stories only loosely tie together anyway.",1484611200,2,1157,4.606796116504855
129862,2,0792157850,"The biggest issue with The Temple of Doom is that it tries so hard to be a self contained story instead of a continuation of the adventures of Indiana Jones. There are no recurring characters from the first film besides Indy himself and there isn't a single new character introduced that is even remotely likeable. The sidekick is unnecessary and strange (why would a treasure hunter be carting around an elementary-school aged Asian boy?), the love interest is obnoxious and never seems to have a real human reaction to any of the situations in which she finds herself, and even Indy himself doesn't have any significant character development throughout the film. We never see anything new from the character, he's just a simulacrum of Raiders of the Lost Ark's Indiana playing at pretend to get another paycheck.

But even the lack of significant characters could be forgiven if the movie didn't rely on THE WORST stoytelling trope in existence: coincidence. The entire plotline would never have happened had Indiana not crashed and found the random Indian shaman to tell them that they need Indy's help. It's lazy and disrespectful to the audience, making it seem like the writer was just making this up as he went along.",1484611200,3,1224,4.913043478260869

129864,4,0792157850,"[This review is of 2013 Blu-ray edition with only a Teaser and a Theatrical Trailer as Bonus Material.] I hadn't watched this movie since I bought it on LaserDisc, which I subsequently ""burned"" to a DVD-R. Felt it was time to upgrade to Blu-ray. In my opinion, this marked the end of the franchise in terms of items worthy of a place in my personal movie library. While pondering this BD purchase I scanned other Customer Reviews. It looks like I need to mount my steed and ride to the rescue of Dr. Jones's reputation (you're welcome, Mr. Spielberg!!).

To those who say this is ""a horrible movie"": Did you fail to notice that Dr. Jones puts aside (temporarily, at least) his quest for personal ""Fortune and Glory"" because...because why? Because he sees that hundreds of children...CHILDREN, for crying out loud!...have been kidnapped and used as SLAVE LABORERS in a mining operation. He sees they are starving, he sees them being whipped before his very eyes. This makes Indy very, very angry. Just as he despises Nazis, Indy despises those who would treat children in this manner. (Indy also hates snakes, but there I disagree with him philosophically/aesthetically. I think snakes are beautiful and magnificent! Sorry about this little digression!) Being Indiana Jones, he will not be content to start a petition demanding the release of the children. He will swing into personal action! Yay, Dr. Jones!! There is still some decency in the world after all, you see. Well, this was 1935, of course. You grasp my point, though, yes?

I understand that a just-published book by a well-known film critic posits that Mr. Spielberg has ""issues with women."" That this is manifested in his treatment of Kate Capshaw's character ('Willie') in this movie in particular. Yes, she is made the butt of a running series of sight gags wherein she is menaced by real dangers, with Indy dismissing her screams of terror as hysterical overreactions to being in an unfamiliar environment. You know, ""typical woman stuff."" But is this movie not, among other things, a wicked satire of the ""Saturday morning adventure serials"" of the 1930s/1940s in which, if a woman character is running from danger, we may bet she will trip and twist an ankle? So our manly hero will be forced to pluck her from her undignified situation and carry her to safety? Hmmm? Are the ""set pieces""/stunt work way over the top, quite preposterous indeed? Of course they are!! Precisely because THIS IS a satire! Great Caesar's Ghost, does no one retain a sense of humor nowadays? A final note: I am not an expert on the real history of the Thugees sect, but if their leader in this story isn't one of the most effectively scary villains of 1980s filmmaking I don't know who the heck we'd substitute for him. I doff my own fedora to Dr. Jones and Steven Spielberg...Oh, right, this is a Blu-ray. The image is mostly very sharp, even in dimly-lighted scenes, and the audio will rattle your floorboards if you give it a chance. Unless you're watching it on your phone or a tablet! But why the devil would you want to do that if you're a real movie lover?!?",1484524800,2,3112,4.750462107208873

129935,5,0792157850,"Of all of the Indiana Jones movies, I actually find this one to be the weakest.  Now that is a relative term, as I have given the movie 5 stars and think it is a really great time at the movies.  I think this one suffers a bit from being a sequel that gives audiences exactly what they want, in other words there really is no growth such in the story, characters, etc such as we saw going from Star Wars to The Empire Strikes Back.  What would I consider to be growth for these characters?  Look no further than the third movie, which introduced us to Indiana Jones' dad (Sean Connery) and gave Indy a background that audiences could relate to.

I consider Indiana Jones to be the single greatest character ever put on film.  The movies are episodic in nature, full of cliff-hangers and featuring many death-defying stunts and sequences.  Some of what we see in the Temple of Doom stretches the limits of believable reality, ie diving out of a crashing airplane in an inflatable raft.  Now I know that all of these movies feature stuff that would be at best questionable, but with some of the other big action shots, I could at least believe that maybe, perhaps it would just be possible for what I just saw to actually work.  But I digress.

The Temple of Doom is chronologically the first Indiana Jones movie, set in 1935.  We pick things up in a bar named ""Club Obi Wan"" (Star Wars reference) where Indy is negotiating with a notorious Chinese henchman over the remains of some ancient Chinese leader.  We are quickly introduced to the American singer Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, and things soon go south.  An action-packed escape from China leads Indy, along with Willie Scott and his sidekick Short Round, to India, where they come across a village that has suffered an attack from Thuggee troops from the nearby Pankot Palace that relieved them of a rock that gave life to their region, as well as all of their children.

Great action movie with human sacrifice and some voodoo torture thrown in for good measure.  The movie has some dark and disturbing moments that actually led to the creation of the PG-13 rating back in 1984 (Red Dawn was the first movie slapped with that rating).

But here is the biggest problem with the movie.  Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade featured a well known villain, the Nazis.  Every one can relate to those guys.  We all know who Adolf Hitler was, and we all know what he wanted to do.  So you have a clearly defined villain and you have Indiana Jones doing all he can to thwart their nefarious plans.  But who among us know much if anything about the Thuggee?  I researched them and learned that they were real, but they simply are not a known quantity.  That makes it difficult to gauge their intentions and why we should be rooting so hard against them (other than they are the obligatory bad guys).

Still, it is an Indiana Jones movie.  Great musical score as always by John Williams.  Harrison Ford ... need I really say how awesome he is?  Steven Spielberg right in the height of his career.",1484438400,2,3079,4.500900900900901

After leaving the cult leader behind in the cathedral room, Indy rides the runaway mine car endlessly down, down, down, only to emerge upper edge of a vastly deep canyon.

Doom runs nowhere, constantly, at 90 mph.  Raiders' Karen Allen was beautiful, tough and (in her own words) ""a G-ddamned partner,"" collaborating with Indy and usefully helping in his/their fights.  Kate Capshaw, who came through a much different casting process, contributes blonde hair and incessant shrieking.  Raiders is art, Doom is an uninspected roller coaster.

130780,5,0792157850,"Objectively it's probably the weakest of the three original Indy films. However, I simply can't give this any less than 5 stars. This movie is FUN. First of all, what an opening scene, wow. They rarely make movies like this anymore with a focus on practical effects/stunts, good characters, story, and action. Another big reason why Temple of Doom works, really this goes for all 3 originals, is that they are very clear in their worlds. A big reason why the new one didn't work was that it didn't effectively blend it's mythological/fantastical concept within the plot. All the original Indy movies had ridiculous concepts but the difference was that they were done extremely well. The first movie deals with the Ark of the Covenant, the second has Voodoo and worship of gods, and the third is The Holy Grail. All these ideas are myths/legends that while at first seem a little silly but because they are woven into the story so well, it's believable. Aliens simply don't belong in an Indy film. After all, Indy is supposed to be an archeologist. He should be investigating, encountering, hunting for ancient artifacts/documents/enemies/historical figures etc.

But even if I agreed with the use of Aliens it still wasn't done well and the movie itself was just poor. The aggressive use of CGI and green screens was bad, the story, acting, and dialogue not on par with the previous films, etc. Temple of Doom no doubt has some ridiculous stunts but nothing TOO crazy like Indy climbing into a fridge and surviving a nuclear blast. Yes it's exaggerated, yes there's some over the top stuff, and yes Kate Capshaw is terribly annoying, but the movie is fun and extremely entertaining with great action, effects, and Indy at his best.",1473724800,,1731,4.847972972972973

It is very entertaining but it does strain credulity to its utmost at many parts.  My particular bete noire are the ""almost there"" scenes - the scene in the death chamber (are the spikes really long and coming down quickly or not?), the chronic lowering of Willie into the pit (a light sweat being the most she had to endure), the head-cracking scene at the stone crushing machine (how many shots show Indiana inches away from his head being flattened and, then, when he stands up, he's five feet away?).  There are also the gory excesses of the dinner and the 'heartwrenching' scene.  They all kind of amount to putting lipstick on a pig.  That being said, the action sequences are still entertaining and the story carries with it enough sense to make it several steps above ""The Mummy"" or even ""Romancing the Stone"".",1465171200,4,954,4.615384615384615

131074,4,0792157850,"I clearly remember going to see this movie in the theater.  I was 17 and had just graduated from high school.  I didn't like it.  The movie lost me out of the gate with that musical number.  It's been 30+ years but I still remember my reaction of ""what on earth is this nonsense?""  It took me out of the movie; I was confused about whether it was supposed to be really happening in that nightclub; I couldn't figure out why there would be dancing girls in a Broadway number in an Indiana Jones movie.  And Short Round.  Man, I did not like Short Round.  He also took me right out of the movie.  I remember walking out thinking, well, that was not good.

Fast forward to recently, as we are marching through the Indiana Jones movies with my young daughter.  I was not looking forward to seeing this.  To my surprise, I actually found myself enjoying it.

Having watched more movies in the last 30 years, I actually understood the point of the opening credits sequence, and enjoyed it.  I wasn't immediately taken out of the movie.  That helped me to appreciate the artistry of the long opening action pieces that come one right after the other.  And Short Round wasn't nearly as obnoxious as I remembered.  Frankly, my 49 year old self found him far more amusing than my 17 year old self.

The movie is an Indiana Jones film, to be sure.  He has adventures, there are mystical artifacts, and he saves the day.  Harrison Ford is great as usual.  I even found Kate Capshaw to be entertaining rather than annoying.

Overall, I liked it.  If you haven't seen this movie in 30 years, or if you've never seen it, it's a worthy followup to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  It's at least worth a rent.",1463702400,,1687,4.385113268608414

Indiana Jones escaping from Chinese gangsters in a Chinese night club in Shanghai, china gets on a plane that crashes into a mountain in northern India, while Indiana jones falls to safety in a yellow inflatable raft and glides on snow and then falls into a river and sails to some poor Indian village with a beautiful blonde lady named willie and a Chinese kid named short round. The story is about Indiana jones recovering some sacred stones with magical powers that will bring prosperity and freedom to the people of the village. The temple of doom is an enormous castle with a demonic temple inside that is made to honor the Hindu Goddess of death Kali. The goddess kali is depicted as a demonic deity that requires human sacrifices and is like the female version of Satan the devil. The victims  hearts are ripped out of their chests and they are lowered into some kind of pit that looks like eternal hell with flames of fire shooting up and devouring and burning the victims. Indiana Jones has to battle the murderous thuggee cult who are the devotees of the goddess kali and free kidnapped children who are enslaved by the kali worshippers  and save his life and his friends and get out of their alive.

I've seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) just once - in the theater when it came out in the summer of 1984.  I saw it at the theater at my local shopping mall.  I remember after the movie was over going to the arcade inside the mall and playing some video games - you know, the good stuff, like Pac Man, Space Invaders, Defender, Centipede, Tempest, etc.  Wow, have times changed (for the worse).  Anyway, this was the first Indiana Jones movie I ever saw.  I remember liking it quite a bit.  It was interesting seeing Harrison Ford playing a different role other than Han Solo, as this was the first movie I ever saw him in that wasn't a movie in the Star Wars trilogy.  To this day, when I think of Harrison Ford I think of Han Solo, THEN I think of Indiana Jones.  Anyway, this movie has lots of action and good special effects.  The acting is good throughout, as is the musical score.

I recommend this movie.",1452211200,5,1032,4.317708333333333

131650,4,0792157850,"Ok... we all know it's the weakest movie of the trilogy (Crystal Skull doesn't even deserve the name Indiana Jones).  That said, it's still a lot of fun to watch.  It's easily the most grotesque of the three movies, with bats, snakes, insects, peoples' hearts getting ripped out, and of course, a dinner scene that has become a cultural reference.  I really enjoy the opening scene in Shanghai: it brings us the unforgettable Short Round, a Chinese street urchin who cheats at cards and straps a block of wood under his foot so he can drive a car.  ""Temple of Doom"" is still fun.

The comparative drawbacks: Kate Capshaw is my least favorite of the female leads, and Mola Ram, apart from being able to rip out peoples' hearts, really isn't that memorable a villain--certainly not the equal of the glasses-wearing Nazi in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's like saying, however, that ""Pretty Woman"" wasn't a good movie.  Compared to Casablanca?  No.  But on its own merits, it still holds up 25 years later.

A point of personal curiosity: does anyone know what Indiana says to Short Round on the bridge?  This is one time I wish I understood Mandarin (at least I assume it's Mandarin).",1437955200,,1181,4.657004830917875

i already own the 2011 Digi-book which has all 4 films on blu-ray plus a
Bonus Disc with all the usual making of featurettes and new featurettes aswell

well Paramount have reissued Temple of Doom again on blu-ray with it's own clamshell blu-ray case this time
and the same thing has been for Last crusade aswell
and it's just the usual Barebones release, absolutely no special features, just the Theatrical trailer
the only difference here is the packaging actually the Disc & cover art is in standard blu-ray case
obviously whoever at Paramount thought of this idea to reissue the film again but without extras has no brains at all
any fan Huge fan of this series will stick with their own Digi book release cause all the special features/extras are with it
any fan like myself enjoy watching the making of featurettes aswell as the film of course
so what paramount should have done is carry over the Temple of Doom making of featurettes to this new Blu-ray reissue
from the Bonus Disc from the 2011 Digi-book, that would be the smartest wissest decision
not leave it barebones, very stupid idea the person who thought of that at paramount had no brains was not thinking at all

as i said this new blu-ray is just the film, none of the extras from the 2011 Digi-book packaging have been carried over
so it's waste of money in my opinion
stick with the 2011 Digi-book that you already have, or if you don't have it then buy the Digi-book you'll have no regrets

131927,2,0792157850,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 1984 film

It begins with a woman singing and girls dancing. Anything goes? This is set in 1930 Shanghai. [Before the war with Japan?] Doctor Jones talks to a powerful ruler and wants pay for obtaining an item. Will there be a double cross? There is a fight in this restaurant! One man fires a Tommy gun in the pandemonium. Jones and the singer make a daring escape! There is a car chase and shooting! This is fun says Short Round. They board a tri-motor airplane and fly away from China to Burma. Then the pilots bail out! They run out of fuel! There is an unbelievable escape from this airplane! [You won't fall asleep here.] Where are we? The people there offer them food. Someone will take them to Delhi but first stop at another city. Siva brought them there says a man, to recover a sacred stone that protects this village.

Why did they take the children? They will ride elephants to get to that palace. Giant vampire bats? Willie is afraid of things that crawl. They arrive at that palace. We see scenes in the palace. This area had the Thugee sect that sacrificed human lives to a goddess. Does that make them powerful? Im sorry. The maharajah speaks. There is a special treat for desert. Willie passes on this. [Is this realistic?] Doctor Jones likes to do field work on nocturnal activities. There is a surprise visitor, but he goes away. [To provide action.] Jones discovers a secret door. [More spooky action for scary thrills.] Do it now! Willie pulls that lever just in time. They all witness a Thugee ceremony of human sacrifice. Rocks glow red in a large skull. Jones will retrieve the stones from that stone sculpture. Jones sees the captive children working in a mine. But they are caught and captured. Can a voodoo doll cause pain?

Can they force Jones to drink that portion? Will his personality change? They prepare for another sacrifice. What will Jones do? What a nightmare! Wake up, Indy! There is a change in plans. Willie is rescued. Lets get out of here! The children are freed and attack their captors. That voodoo doll is used until Short Round stops this. Take the left tunnel to get out. They escape in a mining car for an incredible ride (or car chase). A large vat of water is overturned. Can they stop in time? Water! A bridge over a river offers an escape. Whats on the other side? Who will fall off the bridge? Help arrives! Good guys with guns drive away bad guys with bows and arrows. Jones has saved a sacred stone to return to that village, the children too. Jones and Willie will continue to Delhi and travel on. [Whats next?]

This is a good example of a movie where the action overpowers the story. Jones excels in action, like some lower budget movie serials from the 1930s and 1940s. Does it give a distorted view of life in the 1930s? This is show business, entertainment not history. That musical them for Jones comes from the 1940s movie Don Juan which starred Errol Flynn (no miscasting there). Are sequels better than the originals? Not here. This movie chose to avoid the politics and economics of the 1930s. It is a good movie to watch when you're sick at home. Just don't question the plausibility of the plot and scenes. Could a river slice through stone to make a vertical wall as in this movie?",1426809600,,3290,4.51510067114094

132015,3,0792157850,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" introduced the character of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and was such a massive hit in 1981 - truly one of the greatest action/adventure movies of all time - that there had to be a sequel; or, in this case, a prequel (""Raiders"" takes place in 1936 and ""Temple"" in 1935).

The opening sequence starts out in Shanghai where there's a wild brouhaha over a huge diamond in a ritzy bar. Indy escapes on a plane with a noisy singer named Willie (Kate Capshaw) and a Chinese boy nicknamed Short Round, which leads to the Himalayas and an Indian village. It's clear that they were trying to outdo the opening jungle sequence of ""Raiders"" and that's the problem: They overdid it to the point of ridiculousness. At least the first film kept an air of quasi-realism with its fun, adventurous spirit. ""Temple"" is fun and adventurous too, but the action is so out of the realm of plausibility that it becomes a cartoony farce, not far from a ""Road Runner"" cartoon. Say what you will about ""Raiders,"" but most of the action sequences were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were! Not so with ""Temple.""

The bulk of the story takes place at the great Pankot Palace in India (actually shot in Sri Lanka) and about an hour of that in the hellish bowels of the Palace, the titular Temple of Doom. These sequences feature great sets akin to Conan the Barbarian but with a noticeably comic garnishment. This is why I scoff at criticisms of the movie as too extreme or horrifying for kids. Get Real. ""Temple of Doom"" is a rung or two above a live-action Scooby Doo cartoon.

Kate Capshaw got the part of Willie out of 120 actresses vying for the coveted role. This is the film where she met her future husband, director Steven Spielberg, and they've been married since 1991. Kate's amiable and effective, but her constant screaming really starts to grate on the nerves. Yet that goes with the part; remember Indy's description: ""the worst part about her is the noise"" (lol).

Despite my criticisms, there are some entertaining parts, like most of the opening, the trip with the elephants, the introduction to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene and the initial explorations of the catacombs. Parts of the ending are good too, like the cliff sequence and, later, the rope bridge. Overall, though, the story never gains the momentum or insights of the first film; worst of all, the Temple of Doom sequence goes on forever and it's just not compelling enough to sustain interest, plus it's too cartoony. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prime case of too much flash with too little substance. Although sporadically amusing, it doesn't gel as a whole and is a huge disappointment after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

The film runs (overlong) at 118 minutes and was shot in Macau, China; Kandy, Central Province, Sri Lanka; California, Washington, Arizona and Florida; with studio sets in England.

While Raiders of the Lost Ark remains one of my favorite movies of all time for its captivating plot, humor and swashbuckling action, Temple of Doom felt contrived and silly with ridiculous villains, gross-out food humor and Kate Capshaw's constant whining.  Sure it has its moments, mostly toward the end, when Indy and his pals have to escape from the castle (or mine? mining castle?).  I also liked Short Round as Indy's spunky little sidekick.

Temple of Doom is a roller coaster ride of action and suspense as Dr Jones manages to team up with Short Round and Willie Scott. This is a great adventure movie that stands the test of time. The cinematography is great, the musical score is magic, fun characters, and timeless bad guys. These movies influenced so many video games, movies, and pop culture in general.

The blu ray version of this movie really stands out from the previous editions. The colors really stand out better, and you can really see the difference. The sound is crisp and picture is sharp. I upgraded all my Indiana Jones films to blu ray, and have no regrets about doing so.

** 1/2

After Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'd think they'd tread carefully in making a follow-up film just as adventurous and riveting. Wrong. What we get is a very strange mix of darkness with child enslavement, cults and ripping hearts out of living people. Then we get over the top moments with chilled monkey brains, eyeballs in soup and roller coaster climax that's treading on just silly. Finally, let's not forget Indy gets TWO sidekicks - a willing child accomplice and unwilling female singer. The female singer is nothing more than one scream after another and is nothing more than attempted comic fodder. Willie Scott is not Marion Ravenwood in any shape or form. She can't hold her own and offers no reason for us as viewers to invest in the character and like her. She annoyed me more than she annoyed Indy. Kate Capshaw got it right in later interviews that her character in this film is nothing more than just a pest for Indiana and is a cliche of annoying attributes.

I just finished re-watching this in an attempt to soften my criticism of it. Sadly I can't. Where Raider of the Lost Ark had its darkness, it thematically held it's seriousness throughout the film. There was no monkey brains to behold or perfume on elephants. Temple of Doom openly embraces the shlockery. It vacillates between darkness, forced romantic tension, sidekick jokes, seriousness, then goes lighthearted, back to child abuse, romantic tension, back to light hearted and so on. In short, it is completely unsatisfying. Thematically it doesn't tie together.  I caught myself thinking the movie might have been better had Willie Scott never been written into the film or better, a few more rewrites before filming commenced.

I really missed Sallah too. John Rhys-Davies added a great supporting role to Indy.

The comments from Steven Spielberg in 1989 saying he didn't like Temple of Doom shows that he got why as a film maker this is a bad work.  They took an excellent film franchise with Raiders of the Lost Ark and followed up with this rushed work.  This adventure is watered down with unnecessary extra characters and tried to be too many things it took the great elements from Raiders, modified them and added schlockery.

I'm not even going to comment on the religious representations as they are pretty ugly. Plus, women get a pretty ugly representation too.

This movie isn't all bad however. There are some great Indy moments. I loved how he recoiled with snake with Willie ripped it off her neck thinking it was the elephant pestering her. The homage to Raiders was fun too, where he ran up on two cult fighters and went for his gun to find it gone, then beat them up and ended up being chased had me chuckling.  That doesn't save it from the silly ""spike room"" where he and shorty get trapped. Or wandering these dusty halls and happening on cult ceremony. It's all too coincidental and doesn't flow.

In the end, you'll form your own opinion. Some love this film more than the rest. I have a feeling it has do with their childhood and fond memories more than the quality of the script. Someone wise once said, with Indiana Jones always watch the odd ones. I agree. The first and third tie together the best. Temple of Doom and Crystal Skull have decent moments, but at times they make you cringe.

This one though, is just, well, a disappointment. It's not in the same league as Raiders and Last Crusade.",1415404800,,3449,4.69205298013245

132288,5,0792157850,"I know I'm in the minority here, so I'm going to choose my words carefully: Temple of Doom is, by far, my favorite of the series. It isn't the best (that would be ""Raiders""), but it definitely has the most action and adventure of the four films.

Don't get me wrong, I can understand the hate - it's dark, it's violent, the Thuggee cult isn't well-known, Willie is an obnoxious character; but, I can also appreciate that Spielberg and Lucas set out to make a film that was completely unlike ""Raiders"". And, boy, did they ever.

From the opening scene, this movie is different: First of all, it takes place in 1935, so it's actually a prequel to Raiders. There's a Busby Berkeley - style dance number - ""Anything Goes"", which is an appropriate theme for this story. Indiana is a shadier character than he was in ""Raiders"". He's working for Chinese gangsters; Willie Scott is intentionally the antithesis of Marion. Dan Aykroyd has a bizarre cameo. Once they find the entrance to the Temple (of Doom), this is a non-stop roller coaster ride, including black magic, human sacrifice, and child slavery. Despite the heavy subject matter, there's enough humor to keep it from becoming too dark. John Williams really goes the extra mile with the score. He manages to create a theme from the opening dance number (""Anything Goes""), and it makes for the best score in the series. Mola Ram is a great villain. He steals every scene he's in. I've seen this movie enough to know most of the dialogue by heart, but the finale (on the bridge) still keeps me on the edge of my seat.

I can also appreciate that this is the most pulp-ish of the films.  If you're ever lucky enough to stumble on one of those classic pulp fiction magazines from the 1930's (with the beautifully painted covers), you'll see this is exactly the sort of story they would have printed.

If you can go into this movie with the understanding that it was intended to be a completely different experience than ""Raiders"", you might just enjoy it. There are some intense / scary scenes, so parents should watch it to decide if it's appropriate for their children (but, the same can be said for all of the Indiana Jones films). If I ever had the opportunity to meet Mr. Spielberg, I would ask him (politely) to stop apologizing for it. This movie is a classic popcorn adventure film!",1411257600,3,2338,4.597122302158273

I think the Jones movie creators got confused somehow, and thought the success of the first film was due to the gross factor (limited as it was) rather than the characters and story design.

I would encourage anyone who enjoys the Jones series to watch this at least once, just to be familiar with it for reference purposes, and then put it on the shelf in favor of other, better movies.

This is a fantasy-adventure film is a prequel to the smashing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) even though it's the second installment of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise.  As with ""Raiders,"" it was directed by Steven Spielberg with the story being by George Lucas.

After arriving in India, Indy (Harrison Ford) is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone.  He agrees.  To help him in his quest are Wilhelmina ""Willie"" Scott (Kate Capshaw), a nightclub singer, and his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan).  Along the way, the trio stumble on an evil cult.

S. Spielberg, G. Lucas, and Dan Aykroyd all have cameos.

For those seeking the thrills and excitement of ""Raiders,"" you will be disappointed.

This is what the director said in 1989 about his OWN movie:

""I wasn't happy with [this movie] at all.  It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific.  I thought it out-poltered ""Poltergeist"" [a 1982 horror movie he co-wrote].  There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in [this movie].""

(He said later that the greatest thing he got out of this film is that he met Kate Capshaw who later became his wife.)

Kate Capshaw called her character ""not much more than a dumb, screaming blond.""

However, if you like voodoo, child slavery, human sacrifice, the ripping out of human hearts, hanging, immolation, the slapping of children, excessive violence (I've only mentioned a few things), then this movie is for you!  Out of this mix, this film has been praised for its intensity and imagination.  (Go figure!!)

The reason I gave this movie the rating I did was because of the great John Williams' music and for certain scenes:

(1) The rock crusher
(2) The mine car chase
(3) The rope bridge
(4) The spike chamber

This movie, incredible as it seems, has grossed more than three hundred and thirty-three million dollars.  I think the reasons for this is that people thought they would be seeing a movie of the calibre of ""Raiders"" and simple curiosity - they wanted to see for themselves what all the controversy was about.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) has one extra.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you don't let children watch this movie.  They may get traumatized!!

132505,1,0792157850,"I will start by saying I have a soft spot for Raiders of the Lost Ark. I saw it in the theater in 1981, then watched it endlessly on cable in 1982. I was obsessed with the Atari video game at the time, and even just got a copy of that back in my hands for the first time in 30+ years. But by the time the sequel came out I had other interests and didn't see it. I caught occasional bits on TV here and there, but never felt the slightest urge to see it all the way though. When I saw The Last Crusade, I did like that one.

I purchased the Indiana Jones blu-ray set from Amazon, being lured in by the brief low price of $36 with free shipping. I watched Raiders for the first time in years, and still enjoyed it. It's typical Spielberg, which is normally by no means a compliment, but he does occasionally make a movie that I can enjoy, despite its shortcomings. And let me say that I CANNOT STAND John Williams' movie scores. His themes are so bombastic and over the top that I always dive for the remote to turn the TV down.

Having never seen The Temple of Doom all the way through, I found this to be a good excuse to finally give it a go. My original impressions of the bits I've seen were only amplified. This movie is terrible!! The Asian kid is remarkably annoying, and his shrill voice is very much akin to nails on a chalk board. I found myself wincing every time he interjected. The amount of gore is way over the top, especially for a PG movie. There were way too many things to make the viewer squirm - snakes inside snakes, insect eating, and bizarre creatures crawling all over. It was relentless. But what else was really painful was there was no seriousness about the film. It was almost like a cartoon with stupid attempts at wit and humor in every situation. You were never really concerned about the actors because they were just too busy making wise cracks or jabs throughout. Sure, there was some humor in Raiders, but it could also be taken as a serious film. This was little more than terrible slapstick. I tried (boy, did I try) to make it through the whole film, but after 1 hour and 21 minutes I had to shut it off. I just didn't care to see what happened. If they all died at the end, Spielberg and Lucas included, then I would have finished it. But as it stands, I don't ever need to know what happens. The only reason this dreadful movie is in my collection is because it's part of the package. Everyone involved should be completely embarrassed and ashamed.",1397952000,9,2488,4.246835443037975

132545,2,0792157850,"The plot is much too heavy and the sense of humor is largely missing, in fact the entire movie lacks the 1930's Sunday matinee charm that made the series such a success.

We watched it together as a family, and all of us were horrified at the demonic underground sequences. Personally I do not mind gore, if it is done properly (either intelligently or with wit, as say in Alien), but it has no place whatsoever in an Indy film. There is a big difference between lots of snakes in a dark temple (Raiders) vs pulling a man's heart out while he is still alive (Temple).

Add to that a dumb plot, and you have a real looser of a film. But it would not have seemed to bad, if the others had not been so good. If I remember correctly, Spielberg made the 3rd to apologize for the 2nd. See Raiders and Crusade, and give Temple and Crystal a miss. You'll be the better for it.",1396310400,4,868,4.191616766467066

132547,5,0792157850,"This movie scared the you know what out of me as a kid (I still think Mola Ram is one of the all time darkest of movie villains) and the action was so breathless that I felt my stomach turn at several points. This movie is constructed like a roller coaster--when it starts to get dark, it gets really dark(!), and when it starts to redeem itself, boy does it ever! Indiana Jones is a post-modern, cinematic composite character--an archetype of my childhood memories, and one of the most entertaining film characters to ever emerge from the bowels of Hollywood. Unfortunately, George Lucas later lost his mind in a scary way, cinematically speaking (does he really think that the development of movies needs to be pulled completely towards the visual effects/CGI world, involving all of these silly Star Wars things?), but here, he maintains his enthusiasm for more honest movie adventures (if he now lacks the passion of an equally incoherent writer/producer/director like Quentin Tarantino, he nonetheless has proof that at one point in time he had it together). This movie is so action-packed, so exciting, so visually arresting, so fast-paced, and so frightening and absurd that one almost wants to forgive it for all of its bypass impulses (sure, they wouldn't have survived the opening plane crash, but this film has more ""movieness"" about it than ten other titles that are supposed to be so much better). Child-like, and at times childish, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" pushes a viewer to the edge of what movies can do, making it a front runner in the series and possibly making other cinematic comparisons look boring and sluggish by comparison.
This new DVD print looks worlds better than my old VHS tape copy (which was grainy and red looking) and the sound design (such an integral part to the success of any horror film worth its weight in salt) is absolutely ear-filling. The images are much more crisp--the hellfire blowing up from the pits still appears a bit computerized, but overall this is a vivid, extremely imaginative visual design that makes one question why other talented filmmakers have such trouble creating bizarre worlds as the filmmakers did here. You can now finally see this crazy spectacle on a format that does it cinematic justice.
P.S. Some young viewers apparently don't find this film that scary, but you should be aware that the original poster had a caption reading ""This film may be too intense for children."" Well, and for movie lovers! A+",1395619200,3,2490,4.888888888888889

132654,3,0792157850,"This movie will always be a double-edged sword for me.

On the plus side: It is one of George Lucas' and Steven Spielberg's most superbly visually and technically crafted movies, with a break-neck pace that is like an amusement park thrill ride.

On the minus side: It has a clunky, maligned story that can't quite decide whether it wants to be a horror film or a comedy, a delicate balance that its predecessor, the legendary, adventure serial reviving Raiders of the Lost Ark, held more firmly in check.

Plus Doom contains some of the stupidest dialogue in movie history, particularly when Willie asks Indy:

""You know how to fly, don'tcha?""

Indy thinks about it and says:

""No. Do you?""

This from a man who has a Ph. D? A quick re-write by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz could've yielded:

""Flying wasn't covered in my formal education.""

This smart-assed remark would've been more in character with brilliant archeologist Indy, and would've been equally funny!

If you can park your intellect at the door and enjoy a lot of screaming, it's a fun rollercoaster! The blu-ray transfer looks fantastic, with lots of reds in cinematographer Douglas Sloccombe's lighting, especially in the Temple itself, the red presumably coming from volcanic, fiery fissures, like something out of Dante's Inferno or a really bad fever nightmare.

A scene of the heart being ripped out of the Thuggee cult's high priest's sacrificial victim and a Thuggee guard whipping a slave child make this movie a bit too intense for children under 13, hence this film ushering in the PG-13 rating, so exercise parental disgretion if you have young kids.",1388275200,,1628,4.926739926739927

132707,2,0792157850,"A gory, silly and freaky weird movie (inflatable rafts go flying out of airplanes, etc). Nice opening sequence of poison, antidotes, torch singers (one - Kate Capshaw, who ends up marrying the director), annoying little kids, nutty Old Shanghai setting, corrupt Chinese businessmen, and all sorts of other nonsense. Oddly, the villains decide to doom Indiana Jones by ordering the crew of the airplane that is flying them to abandon ship midi-air (jump out over the Himalayas with parachutes) and allow the ship to smash pilotless into a mountain. What kind of a plan is that? Naturally, Dr Jones and his sidekicks survive by riding an inflatable raft from a mountaintop to the foothills of the Himilayas in no time, they then also get up and walk away from the incident. And it just gets more ridiculous from there. Great. Two good parts in the film - near the beginning when he thinks that he's escaped gangster businessman Lao Che in an airplane, when the door of the we see that the plane is owned by Lao Che Air Services (i.e. he hasn't escaped Lao Che's clutches, he only thinks he has) and Lao Che and companion's evil laughter; the other good part is Indy and Willie's smutty discourse where they momentarily forget that they're in the lion's den and want to have a good time with each other (Short Round can't watch, though, or he has to pay a hundred). Some nice dialogue: ""Hey, Dr Jones, no time for love - we've got company.""

Special features show Stephen Spielberg being interviewed that he wanted the second Indiana Jones movie to be the darkest of the trilogy, perhaps mirroring what was happening with the Star Wars trilogy (makes no sense, since the Indiana Jones stories don't bother with continuity!), but he was probably just after an excuse to justify lower sales since he knew there was no way the second film could be as good as the first. His screw-around movie, so it was not as commercial as parts one and three. The idea of the mine chase, with its gravity-defying stunts, had been slotted for Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it didn't come off. The camera catches George saying ""I'm more of a humor guy than a dark guy."" Yes, George Lucas - the guy with the best sense of humor in all Hollywood. Harrison Ford talking about how there were 8,000-10,000 snakes on the set, thousands of which escaped each day. Among the ""snakes"" were lizards called glass snakes (they're lizards because they blink). We learn that the Tunisia scene from Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the same spot that R2-D2 was captured by the Jawas in Star Wars. Elsa Schneider resented Sean Connery in Raiders III, ""he had my role"" (why are people from the third movie popping up in the bonus materials of the second movie?). Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the screenplay, notes that it's very rare to have a beautiful woman who can do comedy. Huh?",1371859200,4,2836,4.638170974155069

132709,3,0792157850,"A divisive chapter among fans of the series, Temple of Doom is easily the silliest of the initial Indiana Jones trilogy. While I've heard the argument that this character thrives on fantastical situations and traces of lore, for my money the envelope is pressed just a bit too far in this instance. Sure, Raiders used the power of the ark to melt the Nazis' skin and Crusade showcased an immortal knight with a collection of stand-in grails, but in each case those represented the climax of a long, grounded adventure - a mere taste of supernatural payoff. Temple shows no such restraint, diving straight in with voodoo dolls, mysterious brainwashing liquids and, memorably, bare-handed heart removals. It also tinkers with the formula of Jones as a loner, with mixed success. Indy's de-facto sidekick, Short Round, plays up every stereotype of a kid tagalong. He's shoehorned in, no doubt about it, but also adds a new dimension to the larger-than-life lead character via their rapid-fire rapport. The additional presence of a blonde love interest, Willie, seems redundant and unnecessary - her constant shrieks and clueless nature gives the impression Indy's babysitting two kids. Of course, it's not all bad news: Harrison Ford works wonders with his shadier lines and knocks the good ones right out of the park, the comic relief scenes (though over-applied) work surprisingly well, and the action / adventure elements the series is best known for hit all the right buttons. There's no shortage of that old, familiar formula here, but I wonder if Spielberg and Lucas may have overreached in an effort to make the film more palatable to the Saturday morning cartoon crowd.",1371600000,,1674,5.046931407942238

132711,3,0792157850,"If this is a prequel, when and where did Indiana Jones dump poor Short Round?

When this second installment started with an old Busby Berkeley style musical number, I thought I put the wrong DVD into the player.  Yipes.  This was quickly followed by a tense trade-off that soon turned into a slapstick routine between a diamond and a vial of antidote.  Balloons and bad guys, a car chase involving a rickshaw, and Indy now saddled with the most obnoxious whiner ever committed to celluloid: ""I burnt by fingers and I cracked a nail!""  After that inauspicious beginning the film stalls and doesn't rev up again until they're in the Temple of Doom.  At that point, the movie redeems itself with plenty of action, including a chase sequence with mining cars and a whole lot of water.  It can't, however, make up for the constant griping and wailing of requisite damsel in distress, Kate Capshaw.  If caterwauling were an art form, this woman would take the prize.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is not nearly as much fun as the first film, nor does it have the same sense of adventure (that was sorely needed and missed).  I don't know why they thought they needed a prequel that does nothing to truly introduce the character.
No matter what time period they slap unto this, it still feels like it's just the next adventure, no Nazis but plenty of Thuggees to hiss and boo.
Several great set pieces though, do not a good film make.  The trek to the temple took forever!

132794,5,0792157850,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the greatest of the 4 Indiana Jones epics. In my expert professional opinion, Temple of Doom is the greatest movie ever made in the history of motion pictues and cinematic theatre. This second installment is better than Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, and Death Wish 4. Temple of Doom made me want to join the Thugee Cult and I have dressed up as Mola Ram for Halloween for the past 19 years of my life. Talk about inspiration!

Temple of Doom also saved my life from ruins in the gutter. Many a night I spent wandering the underbelly of the concrete jungle, only to find myself at home curled up in the fetal position watching Temple in the dark. Indiana takes a backseat to Short Round (played by Jonathan Ke Quan - greatest living actor of our generation) as Harrison Ford finds himself second fiddle to a 12 year old taxicab driver from Shanghai.

Indiana joins forces with a night club singer named Wilhelmina ""Willie"" Scott and the aforementioned Short Round. Together, the 3 heroes wind up in a small distressed Indian village, where the locals believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after the sacred Shankara Stone was stolen! I have decorated my house with dozen Shankara Stones and believe you me, they indeed have power! My home has survived earthquakes, mudslide and forest fires and all praise goes to the power of the Shankara Stones. Indy, Willie, and Short Round discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding Pankot Palace, which is a booby-trapped ghoulish temple known as our beloved Temple of Doom!

Temple of Doom defines my existence and has transformed life and saved me from ruin. Shankara Stones will make you believe in the power of Thugee. Watch this movie and perhaps it will change you in ways only you could dream of. Oh, what a cinematic feast for the ears & eyes you have made for us Mr. Steven Spielberg, what a feast indeed!",1341532800,6,1926,4.67551622418879
132795,2,0792157850,"Most of the criticisms of this movie have already been made in other reviews, but I thought I'd jump in real quick. The main problem with this movie is it gives the audience nothing to care about.

I didn't care about Willie Scott. She seems to have been made intentionally repulsive and the result is I don't care what happens to her...I wish she'd just go away. The only part I liked with her was at the end when Indy tries to woo her; she yells at him and says she could never share in his adventurous, thrill-seeking lifestyle. ""What a great twist for the end of this movie! It defies cliche, and it follows logically from what we've learned about her character throughout this entire film,"" I thought...then she immediately kisses Indiana...for no other reason than she's a woman, he's a man, and these type of movies usually end with a kiss of some sort (it wouldn't do to have Indy kiss Short Round).

I didn't care about Short Round. At the climax of his character arc he tells Indy, ""you're my best friend!"" Now, I assume this scene is supposed to be heart-warming because there's a little kid talking about friendship...and it could have been heart-warming! The problem is we never saw their relationship develop into a friendship. We only see them play cards once (while Willie Scott screams a lot like an idiot) and we're told that at some point before the movie happens Indy kinda saved him from a life on the streets and poverty. Just a couple scenes of them interacting like human beings would have made this final ""friendship"" moment more meaningful. Also, at one point Short Round tells an elephant, ""you're my best friend""...kind of hard to take his friendship seriously after that.

I didn't care about the villains. Their ultimate plan was some sort of vague threat that they'll topple all other religions and somehow institute worldwide worship of Kali Ma using magic rocks (they have three out of the five they need but they promise that they'll find the other two...somehow...). Because I don't know how they plan to do this I have no reason to take them seriously as a threat. Yes, they had child slaves, but the focus of the movie was shifted from this to the magic rocks. Really, the child slavery thing could have been an engaging conflict for Indy to tackle but, again, because this is an Indiana Jones movie they felt the need to focus on something supernatural...even if it was stupid and didn't make any sense.

Finally, I didn't care about Indiana Jones. I really respect that this movie was trying to do something different, I have no problem with the fact they decided to go dark...but the darkness in this movie just isn't meaningful or even entertaining. Some of the best movies of all time were engaging and ""dark,"" and most of the time they did this by bringing characters through the most strenuous emotional turmoil. Fears were faced, choices made, and ultimately the events left an deep impact on the characters...for better or worse.

Temple of Doom tries to be dark by having Indy literally go underground. It's hot, it's sweaty, and bad people do bad things. But Indy isn't really phased by it...he does turn evil at one point but he's under mind-control at the time so it makes no difference to his character. He just spends the whole movie acting like a weirdo and inexplicably falling for an incompetent bimbo. The fact that he wears a fedora and cracks a whip doesn't make him interesting.

Anyway...I just felt this movie had WAY too many good reviews and I thought I'd give you my take. Long live Raiders and Last Crusade!",1333497600,12,3572,4.661904761904762

132797,2,0792157850,"I will admit that I will often watch films just for the villains. Call me sick or whatever you want but I enjoy a good villain who gets his comeuppance. The first and third Indiana Jones have this, and I really like the French Archaeologist and Gestapo Agent in Raiders. So when I decided to watch Temple of Doom I was excited about seeing another great villain...but then I got Mola Ram.

He is some is the priest of a cult, that is incredibly inaccurate compared to the actual Hindu religion, and he can take over someone's mind or pull their heart out of their chest... that's about it. He is worried that Indiana's quest for some stones will destroy his little cult and decides that he must be dealt with.

He is really not a very interesting character and I did not find him all that scary. Ram seems to lack the passion and drive of other villains in the Indiana Jones movies and this movie suffers for it. I liked how the Frenchman and Nazis were not always on the same page and there was some stress in their relationship. Again in Crusade the villains are different and interesting in their own right but they can still work together for a common goal. The Prince kinda fits as another villain but he is pretty much in the control of Ram the whole movie.

Besides that there is of course Kate Capshaw's annoying and worthless character, gross misrepresentation of Indian culture, and a large amount of gore that might upset the squeamish. But if you want to read about that then just read the other reviews on here. It is definitely my least favorite Indiana Jones, even Crystal Skull was better in my opinion. But that is of course just my opinion and I leave you to make your own.

PS-I was waiting over half the movie for the Nazis to show up and insert a good villain but they let me down. Screw them",1328572800,5,1813,4.386904761904762
132798,5,0792157850,"IMHO, I acknowledge only two Indiana Jones movies worthy of greatness: the Original Raiders movie and this, the Temple of Doom. The other two Indy films: Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are poorly paced, contrived, tired, simplistic and very derivative. I know many people disagree with this assessment, but hold Temple of Doom against the other two movies, and you will see the weaknesses: thin plotlines, poor action sequences, tired pacing and inferior storytelling. The last two movies that simply don't measure up to the first two.

TOD is definitely the darkest of the Indy films; watching the adventure unfold, you are literally lowered into the pits of hell, in the face of true evil and darkness, with one of the strongest villains in film history. This very movie created the PG-13 rating category, which says alot about the level of horror portrayed. Like Raiders, TOD is a fast paced adventure rocket ride that features superb photography, exotic locations, a wonderful new original musical score by John Williams and rip roaring action sequences that stand as textbook examples on how to expertly film an action movie. The various action sequences have a natural flow to them that are physically credible, well sequenced and exciting.  Short Round and Willie Scott are Indy's companions in this sequel, and both add sporadic necessary humor and lightheartedness to break up and balance off the extremely dark and nightmarish sequences. Despite Spielberg's personal opinion about TOD not being his favorite Indy movie, I consider this film one of Spielberg's greatest film achievements. From beginning to the end, you are on the edge of your seat. This is pure adventure in the spirit of the old movie serials.",1325462400,30,1736,5.087719298245614

132800,4,0792157850,"I really enjoyed Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, and am surprised at the mixed reviews it has received in this forum. Most people allude to the fact that it's the darkest and most violent of the 4 films. Well....ONE of the movies must claim this title, and this one is definitely it. Also, people refer to the disturbing images of child slavery and cruelty in this film. All I can say is that while it's not pleasant to see, it's still part of the story, and if it weren't relevant to the plot, etc., then it would've been left out by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Speilberg. On a more positive front, the movie excels in action and suspense; there's a certain ""energy"" to the film, whereas the first film has a certain 'pureness' to it, along with energy. I must say that there are two things that jump out at the viewer when watching this film: First, Indy's new woman (Willie Scott) is an extremely annoying character who screams way too much. In a lot of ways, she simply doesn't fit into this movie. This movie is dark, and her character takes us out if this realm each and every time she lets out a scream or says something stupid. Also, is it me, or does her hairstyle not fit 1935? It almost seems like an 80's hairstyle. I was extremely frustrated with Willie, as she cast an imbalance on the film. Second, while I know that this is a movie that has its cast  inside a temple, it nonetheless has a restricted feel to it in that there aren't enough locations that are explored, thus making it clausterphobic in its setting. This movie reminds me of an action video game, though it maintains its substance and purpose. Overall, this movie is a worthy second installment in the series. The mine cart sequence is worth watching, by the way.",1320019200,4,1739,4.417445482866044

It's one of those you-love-it-or-you-hate-it films, even amongst Indiana Jones fans.  I know quite a few fans who think it's the best out of all four of the films.  I also know quite a few who'd like to forget it was ever made.

The film (4/5):

India.  1935.

After a near-fatal encounter with Chinese gangsters in Shanghai and a harrowing airplane escape, Indy (Harrison Ford) finds himself stranded in the heart of the Indian sub-continent.  He and his companions, resourceful pint-sized sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Qan) and whiny spoiled nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), encounter the shaman of a small village which has fallen on very hard times lately.  The shaman says that the village's children have been kidnapped, and all of the crops have failed.  He and his fellow villagers believe that these tragedies have happened because their religious artifact, a polished brown stone with three white lines carved into one side of it, was stolen and taken to Pankot Palace, home of the regional governor known as the Maharajah.

Indy believes the stone to be one of the five legendary lost Sankara Stones.  Seeing visions of personal fortune and glory, he agrees to travel to Pankot and retrieve the stone.  Once there, he and his friends quickly discover why the stone was stolen.  The Thuggee cult, worshippers of the evil goddess Kali, believe that the stone and the two others they've discovered give them immense control of the minds of other people.  Even the Maharajah is under their mind-control.  The head priest, Mola-Ram (Amrish Puri), and his trusted lieutenant (Roshan Seth) take great pleasure offering human sacrifices to Kali.  The village children they've kidnapped have been put into slavery, forced to dig and search for the remaining two Sankara Stones.  The Thuggee believe that, once all five stones are in their possession, they will be able to control the minds of everyone on Earth.

Will Indy be able to avoid being mind-controlled by the Thuggee?  Will he recover the stone and rescue the children?  Will Willie ever stop her damn whining???

Temple of Doom is definitely the darkest and scariest of all four Indiana Jones films.  This is not too surprising though, when you consider that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were both going through some dark and troubling times in their own personal lives while making this film.  Spielberg, one of the producers of 1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie, was being sued for wrongful death because of a terrible tragedy on the set of that film.  And Lucas was in the midst of a messy divorce and child custody battle.  This film, along with the Spielberg-produced films Poltergeist and Gremlins, were the impetus for the creation of the PG-13 rating a year later.  A stomach-churning yet oddly-hilarious dinner feast, a rescue scene featuring lots and lots and LOTS of bugs, a horrifyingly gory and prolonged human sacrifice, scenes of the slave children being repeatedly physically abused by their captors, LOTS of gratuitous violence and some not-so-subtle sexual banter between Indy and Willie are just some of the reasons why parents of children under 12 should be encouraged not to allow their children to see this film.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is my personal favorite of all four films.  It's not the best one in the series.  Raiders of the Lost Ark is, and will always be, the best one.  Temple of Doom is my personal fave because there are many moments of wonderfully-timed comic relief to counterbalance all of the deeply darker moments in the film.  Some examples of this are:  the villagers openly gawking at Willie as she tries unsuccessfully to climb on top of an elephant, Short Round accusing Indy of cheating while they're playing poker only to have Indy discover that Short Round's been cheating throughout the whole game, and a Thuggee guard knocking one of his fellow guards unconscious by accidentally bonking the poor fellow on the head with a heavy iron mallet.  Of course, there are many other moments of comic relief throughout the entire film.  But, those three are my personal favorites!

Having said all that, I can see why quite a few people do not like this film for those very reasons.  It probably also doesn't help that this is the only film in the series that does not reveal any part of Indy's personal history.

All-in-all, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, while not the best Indy film, is an entertaining way to spend two hours in front of your TV set.  I feel I must repeat, though, that parents should strongly consider not allowing their younger children to watch it for the reasons I stated previously.

The video quality (4/5):

It's pretty good, considering that this film is now 27 years old!  There are some minor problems.  The color quality is a bit inconsistent at times, with flesh-tones occasionally looking a bit overly pinkish.  And there is some slightly noticeable film grain in one or two scenes.  But, those are just nitpicks on my part.  On the major plus side, I didn't notice any edge enhancement or compression artifacts of any kind.  And, that's always a good thing in my opinion!

The audio quality (4/5):

The language options included on the disc are English Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 2.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0.  There also optional subtitles available in those three languages.  The English 5.1 track is surprisingly strong and powerful, again considering the film's vintage.  John Williams' music nicely surrounds you from all five channels, and has some punchy subwoofer bass too!  The dialogue sounds just a tad bit tinny at times, but still comes through the center channel speaker clear and understandable.  And the sound effects make full and effective use of the front and rear surround channels during the film's action scenes.  The only disappointment, sound-effects-wise, is during the film's quieter moments when the rear surround channels are silent except for the music.

The bonus materials (3/5):

First, it must be noted that since this is the May 2008 re-issuing of the film on DVD, a skippable trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull plays before the main menu appears.

Well, folks, there aren't a whole lot of extras to be found on this disc.  What is here, though, is somewhat entertaining and informative.  The following bonus materials are included on the disc:

An introduction by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.
""The Creepy Crawlies"" featurette about the various insects, reptiles and animals seen in the first three Indiana Jones films.  This featurette includes an optional trivia subtitle track.
""Travel With Indy: Locations"" featurette highlighting some of the real-world filming locations used in the first three films.  This featurette also includes an optional trivia subtitle track.
A storyboard featurette highlighting the film's mine care chase sequence.
A collection of galleries featuring on-set production photographs, promotional artwork and concept design artwork for the film's sets, costumes and props.
A trailer for the video game ""LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures"", as well as instructions for downloading a PC demo of the game from the game's website.

The ""Creepy Crawlies"" and ""Travel With Indy"" featurettes are the best of the bunch.  They provide a surprising amount of information and vintage behind-the-scenes footage, considering how short they both are!  The galleries were also interesting to look at, especially the one featuring concept designs for the various posters made for the film's theatrical release.  Chances are, though, that you'll view the rest of the bonus materials once, and never think of them again.

Overall (4/5):

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is action-packed and entertaining, if you don't mind the film's darker elements.  It's not the best Indy film.  But, it's still very fun to watch, if you're an adult or a teenager.  Again, I can't stress this enough, this film probably should not be watched by younger or more sensitive children.  It's likely they'll have nightmares because of it.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is somewhat highly recommended by me, if only for it's many moments of much-needed comic relief.",1317600000,13,8286,5.016849816849817
132822,4,0792157850,"What a shame about this film.

The film started so very well with an excellent opening dance and song piece, fun rollicking in the Shanghai club, the big escape in the bad guys plane.

Harrison Ford was at his best in the role amd he had two excellent support characters in Willie Scott and Short Round.

The devastated village scene, the travel across country with the elephants, Willie's problems with the wild life, the bat scene and then the tour de force dinner scene at the palace, followed by the will he won't he bedroom scenes, and then the trap door and bug scene.

Yep it was shaping up as the best of the series.

But then it seemed to get lost in the caves and though clever it didn't start to pick up again until the underground roller coaster scene.

Look its a good film but it went flat in the middle...a shame because it could have been a contender for the best of the Jones films. Just felt the later half of the film couldn't keep up with the excellent first half.

What a shame.",1316822400,,999,4.310160427807487
132823,1,0792157850,"I totally agree with the previous review.  I watched the film last night with my wife and kids... somehow I'd missed it when it came out.  I recommended it based on my enjoyment of the first and third films in the series.

Temple of Doom is a celebration of cruelty, terrible violence, and some terrible acting.  Kate Capshaw, she is a rotten performer!  Harrison Ford looks like he is hating every minute of his job getting this movie made.  The non-stop action is so poorly paced, the audience has no room to experience climaxes or dramatic tension.

But mostly, the cruelty and torture was unrelenting and, as the previous reviewer mentioned it, a lot of the cruelty is directed toward children.

I would not recommend this film to anyone.  It stinks!",1315008000,8,754,4.694656488549619
132824,1,0792157850,"What were Lucas and Spielberg thinking? This movie is extremely violent and contributes little to nothing to film history. I felt like I was watching two hours of violence just for violence' sake. And much of the violence and torture is directed towards children. One wonders if the makers of this film would subject their own children or teens to a viewing. I hope not.

The film also has no real story line other than a dark religious cult's need to torture and kill people, and the main character's need to retrieve a stone for a village, all while superficially romancing someone who appears not to want to be romanced. The woman's role offers little more than screaming and being ineffective, as she continuously waits to be saved by what is supposed to be a hero (but is a much darker character who is just as violent as his captors).

This is really a poor film. Although it's technically well done (regarding special effects, lighting, and props), most of the film is based on finding violent ways to hurt and test human beings. It's as though the gory, violent special effects were far more important than the story or acting.

I don't usually write a bad review but this was such a visually draining film (I felt sick at times and fast-forwarded through yet more scenes of violence) that I wanted to warn customers not to waste their money or time on this. This really is a sad statement on what passed (and passes) for acceptable movie experience in America. Definitely don't expose your children to such a violent film unless you want them to see how little regard the filmmakers had for human life, evidenced in most scenes throughout this movie. (How ironic that this came from someone who went on to make a movie about the Holocaust.)

I am truly sorry that I wasted almost two hours of my life watching this film.",1312243200,10,1829,4.618461538461538
132825,4,0792157850,"Temple of Doom is infamous as the darker Indiana Jones and for that reason alone it's quite controversial. Some hate it, some like it, few seem to actually love it. Sadly, what struck me upon rewatching it it how much the special effects have aged. Some of the scenes, particularly the water at the end, are clearly set in miniature models with the actors superimposed over the backdrop. Other scenes, like the crocodiles in the water look out of place and have a slightly cooler hue than the rest of the film. It's the sort of stuff that perhaps could be fixed for a blu-ray release, but as it stands these scenes really stick out.

Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott just doesn't add much to the film for me. She's annoying and always scared out of her mind. In short, she comes across as the typical bimbo in distress. I think this is supposed to be funny, and at times it is (like putting perfume on the elephant) but more often she's annoying. I don't think it's Capshaw's fault as I suspect that's how Lucas and Spielberg intended her character. Nonetheless, compared to Marion and Elsa, out of all the Indiana Jones women, she's probably the least interesting. I agree with Indy when he says, ""The biggest trouble with her is the noise.""

On the other hand, I love Short Round. He's got the personality of a 60-year-old cynic in a 12-year-old kid's body. He's the source for much of the film's humor and ultimately the film's hero (""Hey lady, you call him Dr. Jone.""). For such a young kid, he's an incredible actor. The scene in which he plays poker with Indy is one of my favorite in the series (""I very small, you cheat very big!""). In short, he's a great addition to the Indiana Jones team.

Overall, this certainly isn't a bad movie, but it's probably the worst of the Indiana Jones series. It's dark and I definitely would recommend keeping kids away from it, but Short Round makes the story a bit more palatable.",1308787200,2,1920,4.511494252873563

The human sacrifice scenes probably traumatized children for years! The film has been criticized for its dark tone, racial stereotypes, stereotypes about blonde women, and strong violence. John Williams' music score is good and it reflects the dark, nightmarish tone of the movie. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was so violent that the MPAA created the PG-13 rating. In India, Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford) must recover mystical stones for a suffering village and battle a Thuggee Cult. The filmmakers borrow some ideas from the Cary Grant movie Gunga Din. Roy Chiao(Spring Song, Treasure Hunt) played a Chinese crime boss in the early part of the movie. I like Kate Capshaw and she has more charm than her vain, dopey Willie Scott character. Jonathan Ke Quan(The Goonies) played an orphaned Chinese kid who helps Dr. Jones. The Temple of Doom is the only Indiana Jones film with a real climax! Jones and the Indian bad guy(played by Amrish Puri) have an equal chance of being killed by alligators! In Raiders, The Last Crusade, and Crystal Skull, supernatural forces defeat the bad guys for Indy!

The Last Crusade really stunk, but most especially, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull met with a new low of how Hollywood clutches at straws to sell a movie franchise and to keep a legend alive.

Why did they do that awful fourth one? Harrison Ford is old and decrepit these days. The sound man probably had to edit out all his wheezing when he just bent down to pick up his hat. So I can imagine he was struggling a lot with some of the scenes where a stuntman wouldn't work. And that energetic ""Indiana Jones"" theme music was ridiculous to hear knowing that Harrison Ford was probably ready to pass out from running so much on the screen.

We get Indy hooking up with two idiot stand in characters, and accidentally wander into a satanic cult. Call it whatever you like, it is blatantly obvious the makers had Satanism on the mind when they made up the bogus cult of the Thugees, WHICH IS FREAKING AWESOME.

The annoying parts can be ignored and fast forwarded through. The highlights of the movie are its WAY over-the-top ritual scenes when the Thugees worship Kali and pluck out hearts and such. Without these wacky pseudo-satan cult scenes, this movie would not be as popular as it is.

Some don't like it because of Willie & Short Round, others like it because it has more action than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Personally, I do find it to be weaker than Raiders and Last Crusade, but it's also a notch above Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Out of all the primary Indy films, this is the darkest and bloodiest of them all. The atmosphere is less mystical and far more nightmarish. The gore is just as strong as in Raiders, though perhaps slightly stronger. The humor relies more on slapstick, which may not be acceptable for some people. And finally, Willie and Short Round are people you either love or hate. I, for one, don't like these two very much. Willie is your typical damsel in distress, while Short Round is your standard child sidekick you see in other Hollywood action films. They're not that terrible, but they are still annoying.

So what exactly should be said about Temple? Well, it's not that great, but it's still fun. It has a tremendous amount of energy surrounding both the action scenes and the storytelling. You still care about Indy whenever he's in danger. The special effects are still impressive, even if a couple of shots of it look pretty dated. And even though I'm not a fan of John Williams, his music in the film is still spectacular. The plot is obviously contrived, but little matter. In the end, Temple of Doom is still a very good movie, just not as good as Raiders and Crusade. It's still better than Crystal Skull, though.

He also stated the best part of the film was meeting Kate Capshaw (who would become his wife), who co-starred with Harrison Ford.

132868,3,0792157850,"First, this is a good action flick for when you are bored.  It has all the basics any would find in the adventure genre.

Unfortunately, some of the first ""1"" score reviews reflected some of my concerns.  I would suggest approaching this movie as a fiction and based on an individual group of villains, as opposed to the entirety of the worship populace of their goddess.  Not only is the depiction of Shiva being a God of Light figure and Kali being a demonic goddess inaccurate to the views of their religion, people still have this tendency to believe these stories reflect the culture.  Consequently, I warn against this.  When I watched the movie, the Thugee controversy was the least of concern when I saw what people were having for dinner in the film.  In some ways I actually  cannot blame people for thinking it negatively portrayed South Asians.

That aside, I had other critiques.  The female lead, while played well, was not my ideal character.  I also thought Lucas could have written a better movie if he actually made it like he did with Star Wars (which redeemed him in the end, as far as I am concerned).  The story would have been better if it was deliberately portrayed as being based off a myth made by him and inspired by Hinduism, as opposed to have been based off what was already established (albeit with the addendum of negative colonial propaganda and orientalism).  Not only would this remove some cultural representation (or misrepresentation) concerns, but it would emphasize his strengths.

If one can take this as what it is - a fiction - and try not to judge South Asians based on this film, I say this is a good film to watch for what it is.  I personally preferred the other Indiana Jones movies for what they had to offer as far as content goes.  I just would not would not call every German a racist Nazi (who even they had their heroes who opposed the inhumane ones).",1255132800,6,1905,4.5588235294117645
132869,4,0792157850,"In this film, as compared to the previous one, we progress backward from 1936 to 1935. We move across the universe from Egypt to China and India. The team is reinforced with a nice little but strong Chinese boy. The film is absolutely packed with suspense and action, and yet the film is also packed with all kinds of interesting questions though it does not provide us with all the answers, far from it. At the beginning we have the Chinese mafia of this time but the film forgets to explain that this Chinese mafia is the result of the Opium war or wars, of the control of China by the English and other western countries, and that this mafia will be quite happy with the Japanese some years later. This quite one-sided vision seems to support the idea that in China the mafia controls everything, the police, the bars, drugs and opium, the government, you name it you have it. Then in India that poor Indiana discovers and dismantles a terroristic and fascist small potentate that imposes an extreme vision of Hinduism based on human sacrifice (God knows Spielberg makes us shiver in front of this horror), the legend of five miraculous stones that would give the Indians their power back against the English, the colonizing power, and these believers have to exploit children in mines in the worst possible way and with the most unimaginable violence (God knows Spielberg insists on the inhumanity of this crime against civilization). But this seems to imply that this Hinduism is producing that kind of sectarian and dictatorial vision and action. These people must be barbarians and that is purely racist somewhere (it is true Bush will come later with his war on terror that is implying the same thing about another religion), whereas the enlightened Americans are bringing freedom (God it is so true in Iraq and Afghanistan). These people eat insects, spiders and the fresh brain of monkeys, snakes and all kinds of nice juicy animals of that type. But the worst part is the role and function of the English in all that. Their representative is sharing these beautiful banquets with the local maharaja who is a child. Then they come nearly at the end to save the day that is mostly saved anyway, and they don't even use their guns because they use Indian soldiers to do the shooting. What's more these English-loving Indian soldiers have blue turbans, whereas the barbaric slave owners and exploiters have mainly red uniforms and turbans. These red and blue are not gratuitous. But no answer again and we cannot say that the worst violence and the worst massacres in India were done by turbaned Hindu extremists but rather by the very British colonizers. This film purports for the people who don't know history, which means the majority of the audience, that the evil of this world is not the colonizing western powers but extremist Hindus and Chinese Mafiosi. That is at least an extreme lie and an unacceptable disguise, not for truth that does not exist on such subjects, but for the slightest possible objectivity. Entertaining cannot mean conveying racist and western-centered prejudices. I am sure that Spielberg can do better and has done better than that.

132946,4,0792157850,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the second of the Indiana Jones series, is a prequel to the first and third movies.  It opens in a nightclub in 1935 China, where Indy attempts to swap precious artifacts with a Chinese gangster.  The swap goes badly, dissolving into a chaotic scramble around the nightclub and a car chase in the streets.  Its principal purpose is to reintroduce action hero archeologist Profesor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and to introduce his co-stars, beautiful nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Indy's young side-kick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan).  The sequence ends with Indy and his companions escaping by plane, unaware they are about to be involuntarily dumped in India.

Having survived their hair-raising arrival in India, Indy and his friends find refuge in a small village, where the locals have been robbed of a set of magical stones and of their children.  Indy takes on the mission of recovering the stones, accompanied by Short Round and a reluctant Willie.  Their mission takes them to a grand palace and a close and nearly fatal encounter with the ancient and murderous Thugee Cult.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is filled with the thrilling escape sequences, nasty villains, creepy crawlies, booby-trapped rooms and sometimes humorous heroism that audiences came to expect from the series.  Unfortunately, it may be the least loved of the original trilogy.  The clear-cut struggle with the Nazis is swapped for a dark and rather muddled plot featuring a mysterious cult, enslaved children, and magic stones.  For most of the movie, the whiny Willie Scott displays an alarming lack of the fortitude expected of Indy heroines.  The ending, back in the small Indian village, is a little flat since we already know Indy and Willie have no future together.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is highly recommended to fans of the Indiana Jones series.  Despite some shortcomings, it is a worthy and entertaining companion to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Last Crusade.""",1245542400,,2041,5.035714285714286

I feel that the other two use Nazi cliches and not that this one doesn't have Voodoo Indian cliches, but we've seen Nazi's so much in movies that its a bore. Also, this one is funny with the short round character and the girl. The action scenes are better than the first and a persons heart being pulled out is much cooler than someone's face melting.

132949,4,0792157850,"Here comes Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is where Indy (Harrison Ford), his sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan, credited as Ke Huy Quan) and nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) arrive at an Indian village attacked by Thugge troops that stole their Shainkara Stone and the children.
  The trio finds their hideout in Pankot Palace. There they encounter the leader and main antagonist Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), which is where things heat up. This entry was dark and gritty unlike the rest. It was George Lucas' idea. He knew that in the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back was the darkest of the original trilogy (and also the best in the franchise), and wanted the Indiana Jones classic trilogy to have the same feel. The really scary parts are the child slavery depiction, ripping out the heart, volcanic sacrifices, and the blood of Kali potion forced into Indy's mouth. The most disgusting part was the Pancot cuisine, consisting of snake surprise (with eels inside the skin), bettles, eyeball soup, and chilled monkey brain. Gross! On the other hand, the cast and crew were great. It has all the action. The underground sequense looks so real. This, along with Gremlins, helped spawn the PG-13 rating used in the more lighthearted and successful sequels. This can be handeled by kids when a parent is supervising them. This may be the darkhorse of the franchise, but still a worthy entry to the series.",1240358400,,1475,4.826086956521739
132950,5,0792157850,"This is truly a film that defines the overused and utterly cliche'd term 'roller coaster ride' when referring to pop cinema.  This is the second best Indy film out of the four.  I am writing this review to shed some light and to give the great film its due.

We'll start the review by noting that this Spielberg's least favorite Indiana Jones film.  Is it relevant to the viewer?  No, so save that as an argument against the film.  Spielberg wasn't comfortable with the dark nature of the material, and he was that way from jump street.  I'm sure he regretted jumping onboard with the script.  See Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for evidence.  The third Indy movie is so desperately trying to recapture the vibe of Raiders that it becomes one of its downfalls. Plus, Last Crusade does the opposite of what critics claimed Temple of Doom did, it went way too lite and cute. Last Crusade brings back characters we've already met in Raiders and does nothing new or interesting with them.  Brody went from the fatherly professor to the bumbling comic relief.  Sure, it's justified, but its not necessary to any of the plot's proceedings.  Spielberg also tried to give the third Indy depth, but forgot that this type of character needs none, and any is never enough when you have big chases and special effects to contend with.  Plus, Indy part three had the weakest villain of the four.  But with all that said, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, like Kingdom of the Krystal Skull are both four star films, with great love for the serial genre, but suffer from the fact that they are parts three in four in a long running and ultimately tired series.  Okay, enough of that.

A lot of harsh criticisms has fallen upon Cate Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott, the Indy girl of this particular installment.  All b.s., empty femm-nazi diatribes from people who aren't in on the style of this type of adventure film.  Oh, they'll go on and on about how Marion Ravenwood(great name!) from Raiders was more of a independent, equal of Indy's and Willie is the typical screaming damsel in distress.  They're half right.  They're right about Willie's character mold, but the bottom line in these films is that the female always gets captured and needs to be informed or saved by Indy.  Marion was tough, but she still had to get captured for saving in the long run....so, who cares?  Marion came along right after the film Alien had introduced film audiences to a similar character.  People were jonsing for this type of heroine.  More power to them.  But, in the tradition of not copying one's self the sequel(which is really a prequel is if you look at the time line) goes for a more traditional Faye Wraye type of female lead.  The thing people leave out when describing the Capshaw performance is how perfect her comic timing is.  Yes, she's a screaming brat of a lounge singer but it's all played for laughs and Capshaw hits the comic notes just perfectly.  Yes, she sceams too much, but almost all these types of films have too much screaming from their female characters, they still do.  Capshaw is really funny in this film.  She has three shining moments in the story; the dining scene in the palace, the spike trap with Indy and Shortround, and the seduction scene right before Indy is attacked by the Thuggee in his room.  Well directed, perfectly acted, really funny and well timed, and truly reminiscent of the old serials of the 30's and 40's.  There's a Howard Hawk's level of timing and exchange in these scenes that is awesome to behold.

This one isn't as prominent, I think, but I have heard jibes against the character of Shortround.  Apparently, he's really annoying, and the fact that a kid was included into a serial-inspired, adventure series most commonly marketed and for children was a big insult to bed-wetting, basement dwelling fan boys.  Sure, I hate when kids are introduced for the 'cute' factor, but this particular kid was restrained and he is actually likeable.  He's used as a foil to the Willie character and they become the comic duo act of the film.  This type of comedy is necessary or the film would've gone as dark or darker then the original concept had intended.  Plus, the comedy is in the vein of Laurel and Hardy, broad and goofy, and in the tradition of many other film's this series is emulating.  Also, this film doesn't have the benefit of having Indy as a professor or his interactions of an old flame, so having Shortround gives Indy his humanity and makes him less of an invincible action movie cypher.  The same people who object to Shortround seem to have no problems with the overly sentimental addition of Indy's strained father and son relationship in the third installment.

Now onto the darkness...OOOHHHH, the darkness.  Personally, I am always up for some shades of black in my traditional action adventures fims.  So was the audiences of 1985, this film was a huge hit, equal to the box office of the original.  The film's subject involves a cult with mystical powers give to them by some rocks, that enslave children in underground caverns and mines.  Yeah, its pretty bleak stuff way before we get to the heart-ripping scene, which is in essence no less dark or graphic then the nazi's melting at the end of Raiders.  The tone of the film shifts from the goofy tropes of the serial world to the Abbott and Costello stylings of comedy.  The silly nature of the whole Indy series warrants such shifts and they come naturally when they wouldn't in a film such as Lethal Weapon or Die Hard(just see the horrible Lethal Weapon 4 for proof).  The villains of this film are truly straight out of any old or new horror film.  They last and you can't wait to see Indy triumph.

The sets in this film are the best of the entire series!  The cult's underground mine lair is truly amazing to behold.  The design and lighting in all of these scenes are all perfectly executed, original and belong to the wonderful camera work of Douglas Slocombe(DP on the first three Indy films).  The action scenes are like nothing seen at the time.  They've been eclipsed by modern technology but they are still awesome in execution with a little perspective on the mind when watching.  Though, this film has less action then all the Indy films.  We start off with a bang in Shanghai with a lounge gun fight, directly followed up by a logic defying escape from a crashing plane using a rubber raft.  Awesome and exciting stuff.  The film doesn't slow down after that but it takes an extended break from the action.  We get to see locations, booby-traps, meet the villains, and gaze into the sets.  Once that's over we get the awesome mine-cart chase and a fist fight along a delapidated bridge above gator-invested waters.  Great stuff.  Some of the best action spectacles in the series next to the jeep chase in Raiders, the tank chase in Last Crusade, and the Amazon sword/jeep chase/killer ants attacking/machine gun blasting/monkey jumping scene from Krytal Skull.

Also, and this may just be my personal prediliction, the film is just WEIRD.  The concepts are weird and way out there.  A lot of P.C. police deputies will complain about how the Indians are portrayed and how silly the dining scene it, but who takes these films that seriously?  It's called Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom for crying out loud!!!!  This is not a realistic culture and travel guide.  It's an excuse to add flavor and spectacle onto the preordained action sequences that all defy logic and plausability(Krystal Skull gets flack for the refrigerator scene, but no one has any problems with any mentioned action scenes in the previous three films).

Basically, all four Indy films are the same in structure and tone.  The first two are darker, and the last two are liter, but only Temple of Doom breaks the Raiders structure.  They had the right idea, and as much as I enjoyed Last Crusade and Krystal Skull, I would've appreciated a constantly chaging structure and tone.  Once all the whiney parent police cried foul at this film(whining on the level of the loathed Willie Scott) Spielberg chickened out and stuck to the tried-and-true formula of Raiders, but further lightened up the proceedings.  I love this series and don't dislike any of the films in it.  Its truly one of the view films series that contains few flaws and stays true to its origins more so then most film series.

Then there was all the unwarranted blasts against Krystal Skull.....Ah, maybe next time.",1239926400,3,8497,4.695064232589588
132951,4,0792157850,"For a long time, this was the only one of the Indiana Jones films I did not like. Because it came as part of the package that introduced it to DVD over five years ago, I had to buy it if I wanted the other two, so I gave it a another look. Wow, all of sudden I liked it.

For the first time, the woman (Kate Capshaw) and the young boy (Ke Huy Quan) weren't as annoying as I had remembered them. The  kid really had rubbed me the wrong way, but this time only Kate was annoying....and she was fine once she calmed down and got rid of the hysterics.

The action in this film is mostly at the beginning and at the end. It is so Rambo-ish (bad guys never hit the target but good guys always do) it is ludicrous. It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots, paying homage to voodooism, spells and other nonsense.

Yet, despite these criticisms, it's entertaining start-to-finish and has some fantastic visuals. The photography in here is beautiful: the best of the Indiana Jones adventures. I particularly liked the opening dance number which reminded me of a Busby Berkeley extravaganza.

132955,4,0792157850,"Three years after he successfully thwarted the Nazis attempt to harness the power of the Ark of the Covenant; Indiana Jones is back for even more adventure with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". Joining star Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg we have a new lead actress, as Kate Capshaw (""Black Rain"") becomes the newest Indy girl, and young actor Jonathan Ke Quan as Indy's latest associate, the pint-sized Short Round; along with two new writers, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, that had previously worked with producer and co-creator George Lucas on his teen classic ""American Graffiti"". With all of the pieces in place, it was time for the adventure to continue, as ""The Man in the Hat"" was back once more on the silver screen.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" finds our hero (Harrison Ford) narrowly escaping a Shanghai nightclub, and traveling deep into the heart of India where he suddenly finds himself neck-deep in an evil plot to enslave the children of a small village. After discovering the source of the enslavement to be that of the sadistic Thuggee cult; Indy will do whatever it takes to save the innocent children from becoming permanent slaves in a labor camp, with the assistance of his diminutive sidekick Short Round and his newest bit of eye-candy, a lounge singer named Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).

With the first film, the burgeoning Indiana Jones franchise established itself as a light-hearted, family friendly, action-packed, thrill ride full of adventure and wonder; however, with this next film ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the series took on a decidedly darker and more sinister tone. I personally enjoyed this darker take on the character and his adventures, and thought the film, even though it was more mature than its predecessor, was still full of fun and adventure that the whole family could enjoy; just with a few parts that the little ones may need to look away from or have explained to them due to the maturity level being raised. Apparently, many fans of the series and moviegoers in general, felt differently than I about the direction this particular installment took. Many felt that the series was better served by a lighter storyline with more comedy and action, and not so much drama and even a little horror thrown into the mix. With that being said, most still enjoyed this newest adventure of archaeologist Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr., and even with the darker storyline gave this movie enough box office treasure to ensure another adventure would grace the silver screen yet again. So, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on the whole ""tone of the movie"" issue.

Harrison Ford fresh off his final turn as Han Solo in ""Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi"", gave audiences yet another terrific performance as Indiana Jones, his second most iconic character in his long-lasting career. Having already played the role once before, Harrison definitely seemed more confident as the adventurous tomb raider; and the darker storyline allowed for a new, more dangerous side of our hero to be showcased, albeit briefly. I'm sure this new aspect of the character was fun for Harrison to play, and as a fan of the series, I appreciated that the writers took a chance on having Indy be a little darker in this film than he is in any of the others. Alongside Harrison Ford, we have actress Kate Capshaw as Indy's newest love interest, Willie Scott. Out of the entire film, if there was one thing I feel the need to complain about it would have to be Kate Capshaw's character. Now, I wasn't the biggest fan of Karen Allen's character of Marion Ravenwood in the first film, but after about the first 5 to 10 times Willie whines to Indy about this and that, I found myself wishing Marion would show up and deliver that same punch to Willie that she landed on Indy after they first met in the beginning of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Some may think I'm being a bit too harsh, it's not that I disliked Kate's portrayal for the entire duration of the film, and I don't believe the whining aspect of the character to be completely her fault, I just thought that for the lead female character in the story she seemed far too annoying to root for or care anything about. This in turn made me wonder aside from her physical attractiveness, what could Indy possibly see in her that would allow him to ignore her lesser qualities like incessant whining or extreme materialism?

Joining the more experienced actors, we have newcomer Jonathan Ke Quan (""Goonies""), as Indy's hilarious sidekick, Short Round. His wide-eyed wonderment, along with the semi-father/son connection between he and Indy, made many of the really dramatic moments of the film even more touching, not to mention his wonderful comedic timing made some very tense moments a little less so, but without being out of place or detrimental to the story's integrity. Not to sell the rest of the cast short by not giving them their due attention, most of them did a really good job throughout the film, so they deserve a lot of praise as well; especially the actor who portrayed the leader of the Thuggee cult, now that's one voodoo guy that you wouldn't ever want to cross.

Oddly enough, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is actually intended as a prequel to the first film. Many viewers may not be aware of this fact, and I personally find it somewhat surprising to think that even back in 1984, producer George Lucas (""Star Wars"" saga) was hard at work making yet another movie series move backwards in time once he had already established such beloved characters' with their initial movie(s). Here I thought this was something he did only recently when he revisited his Star Wars universe to create the first three chapters in his epic six-part space saga. Anyways, I digress.

To sum up, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a much darker film than its predecessor, and to some viewers that can be construed as a problem for the movie. I personally disagree, but to each his own. Despite its darker tone, the movie is still full of action and adventure, and even some good laughs to lighten the mood, and I believe it to still be a movie that the entire family can sit around and enjoy together, along with the first one.

""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is rated PG for violence and brief language.",1225065600,,6359,4.723423423423424
132986,4,0792157850,"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one on earth that thinks this is a good movie.  I've always liked it a lot, and I'm not really sure why so many diss this film.  It's a hell of a lot darker than the first one, in fact REALLY dark.  The scenes in the ""temple of doom"" are very intense, especially for their time (the controversy this film engineered made the MPAA invent the PG-13 rating).  But the film has even more stunts than the first film (and a lot of them are awesome).  I especially like the mining car chase (even though it's a little hard to believe at times, even in escapist cinema like this one).  The ""dinner"" scene could give current reality TV shows (where people eat disgusting things) a run for its money.  It's a very memorable film, although it's may be too intense for very young children.

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a very good film.  Ford is excellent as usual, Kate Capshaw (the future Mrs. Spielberg) is kooky and kind of endearing, and Short Round is a decent kid sidekick (at least you don't want Indy to throw under the tracks or anything like that).  Spielberg's direction is excellent as usual, and I haven't heard people complaining about this one like they have about the latest entry.

132987,4,0792157850,"A prequel to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM follows Indiana from China and through India as he attempts to get back to civilization.  After being double-crossed by Chinese gangster, Lao Che (Roy Chiao) in a nightclub, Indiana (Harrison Ford), nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and young sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) find themselves on the run and flying over India.  Left to die in a crashing plane, the trio escapes and eventually find themselves in a small Indian village.  The crops are dying and the people are weeping in mourning.  The village leader tells the visitors that the reason for their trouble is because the ancient cult of Thuggee has been revived.  The Thuggees have stolen the village's Shiva lingam, a stone that Indiana comes to believe might be one of the Shankara stones, and have kidnapped all of their children.  The village elder claims that the Thuggees are headquartered not far away in Pankot Palace. He believes that Indiana Jones and his friends have been sent from some higher power to help them.  The village elders agree to take Indy and his friends to Delhi, but only if they first go to Pankot Palace.  Indy agrees, more out of curiosity and the chance for ""fortune and glory"" than anything else. A disgusting meal, a horrible death, and a mine car chase all follow.

Most viewers find INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF JONES their least favorite Indiana Jones movie. That's not to say that ToD is a bad movie because it's not.  ToD is filled with action and memorable scenes, e.g. the nightclub scene, the dinner scene, the sacrifice, the mine car chase, et al.  There are all kinds of witty one-liners.  I really enjoyed the character development we see in Indy through the movie, especially in his relationship with Short Round.  Also, the acting is really well done from star Harrison Ford to Amrish Puri as villain Mola Ram to the small bit parts and cameos such as Dan Akroyd.

With so much good stuff in it one may wonder why ToD is one of the least-liked parts of the Indiana Jones saga.  I think the reason for this is because of the shock factor of certain elements of the movie e.g. Mola Ram ripping a man's heart out of his chest while it is still beating or the special dessert of monkey brains at the dinner.  These scenes are memorable, but they are completely unnecessary to the film.  The dinner scene is just as funny and disgusting without the monkey brains in it.  The sacrifice scene is just as horrifying without seeing the beating heart being ripped out of the victim's chest.  These scenes and others like them made ToD more violent and scary than it needed to be.  Scenes like these in the movie turned away many parents and brought rounds of protest when the film was originally in theatres.  In fact it is because of ToD and GREMLINS (two movies that Steven Spielberg was associated with) that the PG-13 rating came to be (both of these movies would have been rated R if it hadn't been for Spielberg's association with them).  Parents and other adults complained they were too violent for children, but children were the prime targets for the film.

I like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  There were parts of it that frightened me a great deal when I first saw it as a child. However, over the years the film has grown on me.  I understand now some of the reasoning for having such a dark episode in the saga.  People can become lost in redemption, but they can also find salvation and illumination, something explored in depth in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.",1221609600,,3588,4.6198738170347005

It has a sort of slapstick feel in some areas and it also has some fairly graphic scenes of violence and gross outs!

Considered the black sheep of the franchise, this entertaining and quite dark installment is underrated by fans of the first and third movies. Steven Spielburg directs once again and George Lucas produced and made the film's storyline, this movie is often scorned by fans because of Kate Capshaw with her complaining & screaming and of course ShortRound. Well i disagree on the ShortRound character cause he did provided some laughs and i agree that Kate Capshaw's character was a pain in the butt, the film did had good atmosphere with some memorable action sequences like the mine cart chase. There's a sense of creepiness through the film like the memorable bug area, some dark humor like the disgusting feast sequence and the gory but effective moments like the infamous heart ripping sequence that caused the MPAA to create the ""PG-13"" rating in 1984. Despite some flaws, the movie is a gritty and exciting but it's not as good as ""Raiders"" or ""Last Crusade"" nor as fun as ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" but it's not as bad as some fans proclaimed.

132994,4,0792157850,"The second instalment of the original 80's Indiana Jones trilogy returns with much of the bang an whollop of it's predecessor, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. The superb opening, a musical number ""Anything Goes"" in the Shanghi club Obi-Wan is a great way to roll the opening credits and it leads into a spectacular set-piece, involving Chinese gang lords, a ditzy 30's night club dancer (Kate Capshaw) and some valuable ancestral ""treasure.""

All this sets us up for a thrilling ride that sees Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) make his way to India, with two tag along helpers, his whip and trusty fedora to aid a village who has suffered at the hands of an infamous cult, bent on mining the area for the sacred and powerful Shankara stones.

Along the way, there are numerous dangers the protagonists must face (none of which I'll reveal here!), in a series of wonderful action packed set-pieces.

I must say though, I'm at a loss as to why people count this as the worst film in the original Indy trilogy. While it certainly is not as good as the incredible 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', it's absolutely light years ahead of the incredibly stupid and tired 'Last Crusade'.

This film does do away with some of the more light hearted moments from ""Raiders"" and the jaw-droppingly stupid attempts at humour in 'Last Crusade' and is certainly a darker film, but to me that's a good thing. There's nothing wrong with a little injection of seriousness into a rip-roaring adventure movie. In fact, as I age, I appreciate the film more and more, while subsequently feeling more and more distance from the third film in the series.

Apart from the abandonment of over the top stupid humour, gone also are the nazi badguys from 'Raiders' to be replaced by the Thuggee cult. A fictitious version of an actual 18th / 19th Century Indian cult, also called Thuggee, who practiced robbery and murder of travellers during the Raj.

The Thuggees here, of course, are as about as realistic as the portrayal of the Germans in 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade' or the Russians in 'Crystal Skull' and serve only as a foil for Jones. But they do it well and their leader ""Mola Ram"" is menacingly played by Amrish Lal Puri and is the best of the Indy bad guys.

I understand that some people may not like the darker tone of the piece, but there's nothing here that is ""disturbing"" or ""horrific"" as some people have suggested, in fact, I'd say the ending of 'Raiders' is far more ""disturbing"" than anything on show in 'Temple of Doom'. In anyway I find it remarkable that anyone (adult or child) could be ""disturbed"" by an Indiana Jones movie. I first saw this when I was 10 and loved every second of it.

'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is a fitting sequel to the brilliant 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', it retains the fantastic set pieces, violence, magic, incredible stunts, wit and charm that the first movie had, with some good performances from the people concerned and adds a few new things into the mix as well.

132995,5,0792157850,"Temple of Doom in many ways is the BEST Indiana Jones film for several reasons. It's nonstop fun and action like the others, but the fictional Thugee villains are a better alternative to the Nazis (who are also reprised pedantically in the Last Crusade) - people affected by Nazi Germany in real life may have a hard time sitting through films that feature them - though negatively and ultimately foiled. Mola Ram is the darkest, most powerful villain of all three films, and the concept of the stones is total fiction, which allows for believable and limitless possibilties in storytelling. The Ark and the Grail, though taken from real life religions, are still fictitious artifacts (Religious people can argue until they're blue in the face) but there must be care in Hollywood handling people's hallowed beliefs, as not to offend. You don't have that handicap with a fictitous Indian Cult. Also, Indy is not acting in his own interest for fame and fortune, but is helping a poor village and saving hundreds of children. That's Superman with a fedora and a whip. Plus, TOD has the best bugs, the best sets, and the bridge scene!!! C'mon!!! The chemistry between Indy and Shorty is great, and Willy wasn't a love interest at all, more of a female sidekick with a hint of romance, but she was never written as a replacement for Marion.

133018,2,0792157850,"I did want to see the whole series for continuity, but in a lot of ways, ""Temple of Doom"" blows continuity right out of the water.  If you really want to watch the films in chronological order, you need to start with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (occurs in 1935) then watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (occurs in 1936).

When ""Temple"" opens, Indy's (Ford) trying to get an idol from Chinese gangsters. He manages to escape them--but unwittingly ends up on one of their planes with nightclub singer Willy (Capshaw) and 12-year-old Chinese orphan boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan).

Indy wakens to discover their pilot has bailed out and left them without parachutes.  They crashland and end up in India.  A beleaguered village elder seeks Indy's help to recover their sacred stones and the kidnapped village children.  What they discover is a Thugge cult.

This is probably the roughest of the Jones flicks so far and IMHO, stretches the PG-13 rating to the breaking point with violence, harm to children. Capshaw is supposed to be a comedic foil, but she just comes off useless. Short Round is cute, but he's not Sallah and Spielberg must have realized that, because he doesn't appear in later films. Harrison Ford is good--he just can't quite carry the whole film on his rugged shoulders.

Then in 1984, the sequel was released: INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  The thrill was gone.  All of the action scenes looked like models and bad special effects (where was the stunt work that made the first film so exciting?).

I didn't like the heroine (although the director certainly did since he married her).  Someone actually counted the number of times she screamed to see if she set some kind of record (Kim Basinger beat her in 1989's BATMAN).

I hated that little kid.  Even worse than I hated the little brat from the old Godzilla movies.  Just annoying.

And the story was just gross and mean-spirited.  Bugs, monkey brains, human sacrifice and incineration.  Nice.

A big, induglent, ugly sequel.  A few years ago, the defunct Premiere magazine did a retrospective of these films and nearly everyone interviewed made excuses for it.  ""Well, George (Lucas) was going through a divorce at the time....""

I wasn't a huge fan of THE LAST CRUSADE either but...at least it wasn't as bad as TEMPLE OF DOOM.

133022,4,0792157850,"The middle film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy is often seen as the weakest entry, and there is little to argue about that there.  The problem isn't that it is a poor film, but that its surrounding entries are fantastic, and looked at as two of some of the best movies of all time.  Both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade succeed because not only does Indy go after some very interesting Biblical artifacts (The Ark and The Holy Grail), but he has to fight off a legion of Nazis in both films.  In Temple of Doom, Indy helps save a village from it's ruining fate in India by going after the Shankara Stones, stolen and held by a group known as the ""Thugi"" within Pancock Palace (spell?)  While the result is fun and indeed different than the other films, there is a noticable loss of plot excitement compared to Raiders and Crusade, along with other annoyances that keep this film below par compared to the others.

Originality helps and hurts Temple.  As mentioned by many reviewers, the film is the darkest in the series, with scenes of sacrifice, children slaves, bug eating, and a scene of Mola Ram pulling out an innocent's heart.  The film is rated PG, but would definelty be PG-13 if it had been released after the PG-13 system came out a few years later.  The story isn't as interesting as Raiders and Last Crusade, but still remains interesting nonetheless, which gives the viewer much curiosity about this unusual religion that the Thugi practice.

Indy's sidekick and girlfriend don't help much either.  Although Short Round has become an icon in the film over the years (one could argue), providing humor and lots of memorable one liners, he more or less drags pacing along, as well as Indy on his adventure.  Wily Scott is the most annoying girl of the 3 Indy films, and her acting isn't really all that teriffic, with her whining and complaining getting more on one's nerves than adding any humor which I belive to be the attempt.

For some really good news, the action in Temple of Doom is incredible, and in my opinion some of the best of any Indy film.  The beginning of the film starts off with great pacing that never lets up until we reach the India village.  The scenes of sacrifice are highly entertaining, with crowds of Thugi cheering on to the beat of drums and Mola Ram holding the victim's burning heart in one hand while the victim is being lowered into a pit of fire (don't worry, it's actually more of a fun scene than disturbing).  But the most memorable scene is the mine cart chase that still looks impressive to date.  A fast and furious chase that seems to go on for quite a while, with unexpected and clever action along the way.  The film ends with the classic bridge scene, where Indy cuts the rope, splitting the bridge into two, high above a river of crocs.

It's Indiana Jones, so in other words, its a great film.  The weakest and most annoying in the series, Temple of Doom still thrives off of originality and impressive action.  Despite the fact Ford's supporting actors are a little weak, he still gives us a great performance as always.

133024,4,0792157850,"The details of new DVD editions of the three classic classic Indiana Jones movies with all-new special features have been announced.  They'll be available separately for the first time on DVD, or as a set.  They were previously only available on DVD as a set.

The new releases will coincide with the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which comes out on May 22nd.  They'll have new special features designed to introduce new Indy fans to the old movies, and to introduce old fans to the new movie.

The Indiana Jones movies are George Lucas's recreation/update of the serialized adventures of the 1930s and '40s.  The original three movies were made in the '80s and set in the '30s.  They feature Harrison Ford as a mild-mannered archeology professor who moonlights as an adventurous seeker of priceless antiquities.  This takes him to exotic locations across the world, and gets him in some very tight spots of the kind that only a movie hero could get into, or out of.  He invariably finds himself opposed by dangerous men with evil plans for the powerful objects only he has the skills to recover.  There are elaborate set pieces with creepy critters, ancient traps, fights with weapons from bare hands to airplanes and tanks, and sometimes supernatural forces.  Along the way Jones manages to have some romance too.  Humor is a big part of the fun.

This is the second in the series but is set one year earlier than the first Indy movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1935.  After barely surviving an attempt to acquire an antiquity in China, Indy finds himself in India with a woman friend and male sidekick (a trio as in all three films).  They're enlisted to recover a village's sacred Sankara stone and kidnapped children, both held by an evil man with designs to find and unite all five Sankara stones to rule the world.  This project involves ritual human sacrifice and an underground mine, each of which provide close calls for the heroes.

This film, while incorporating light humor as before, is somewhat darker in overall tone than Raiders (reportedly by design, as Lucas and Speilberg were each in a dark mood after romance/marriage failures).  Not especially violent by current standards (PG, though it played a part in leading to the creation of the PG-13 rating), I think most kids and parents will be fine with it.  It's still all for fun.

The creepy crawlies featured in this installment are lots and lots of exotic insects.

If you don't want the whole set and don't want to wait until May, you could get a used copy of the old Temple of Doom DVD (people sell them out of the sets).  The difference is in the extra features.  The bonuses from the old set are on their own disc, so what you get when you buy just the old Temple of Doom DVD is pretty bare.  The new release, on the other hand, has the following, all new:

-- ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: An Introduction"" by director Steven Spielberg and creator/producer George Lucas

-- ""Creepy Crawlies,"" in which Spielberg, Lucas and co-producer Frank Marshall reminisce about snakes, bugs and rats

-- ""Locations,"" on where the films were set and where they were actually shot

-- storyboard sequence: ""The Mine Cart Chase""

-- DVD galleries of illustrations, props, production stills and portraits, FX/Industrial Light and Magic stuff, and promotion/marketing materials

-- ""Lego Indiana Jones,"" a demo and trailer for a game based on the trilogy

If you like a few extras, you'll probably prefer this new DVD, though maybe not enough to upgrade from the old one, or to wait until May.  I like audio commentaries, myself, and since they're easy to produce and tend to bring out points not covered in other features, I subtract one star for a special edition without any, but I look forward to the rest.  If you don't care about commentaries, this may be a five-star DVD for you.

There have been rumors of deleted scenes, but none are included.

Some will want to wait for a high-def release, which makes sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.  Many speculate that a Blu-ray release will come out for Christmas, but that's sheer guesswork.

There's also some speculation that an even better edition with all four movies will soon supersede this new DVD.  The four movies may get bundled, but I doubt that there will be a better edition of this movie soon, if ever, on standard DVD.  Keep in mind that the previous set came out over four years ago, and if not for the new movie, it would probably still be the only release in the over ten years of the DVD era.  The next upgrade may be high-def only, and may not happen for a while.

Well, Indy almost escapes.  Yet another attempt at double crossing him leaves the trio stranded in India.  There, they find a remote village that is willing to lead them back to civilization, but only after Indy has returned their sacred stone and their children from a nearby temple.

This mission turns out to have plenty of danger.  Can Indy accomplish his mission and keep his companions safe from a very evil villain?

I had heard rumors about this movie, but just now finally got a chance to watch it.  Many people complain about some scenes in the middle that are pretty disturbing.  In an attempt to make this movie darker then the original, the filmmakers upped the squirm factor.  Frankly, I felt those scenes were out of place and over the top, especially in a PG film.

Having said that, those scenes are surrounded by plenty to like.  The action is phenomenal.  Not necessarily believable, but phenomenal.  I loved watching those scenes and will definitely revisit them in the future.  And there were some great comedic moments as well.  The acting was top notch when it might have gone over the top, which keeps things entertaining for the viewer.

This has a well deserved reputation for being dark and disturbing.  As a result, you might want to view with caution.  But if you can ignore those scenes, there's still an entertaining film here.",1201564800,,1631,4.802158273381295

- The comedic elements that were there but a little more covert in the first one are overt here and a little too much so in my opinion.
- I didn't care for the side-kick addition, I found it annoying. Sorry Short Round.
- The visuals outdid the storyline, that's never a positive in my book.

133057,4,0792157850,"First off, there are things about this film I really love. The play between Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan is great, (a pity it wasn't utilized a bit further but that's the price you pay for action at every turn) as are the scenes with Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott. She provides Indy with the perfect antithesis to his stoic, cool behaviour. The spike chamber is a brilliant setpiece and something that everyone will remember once having watched it.

It's in the second half that things go a bit wrong. When Lucas described Temple Of Doom as the dark sequel to Raiders (a la Empire Strikes Back) it confused me slightly. The underlying storyline is indeed darker, as it depicts Kali worshipping, human sacrifice and children being on the receiving end of some nasty violence. However, the overriding tone of the film is more frivolous than any other Indy flick. This comes from small, incidental snippets of comedy that appear in inappropriate places and points where it just turns outright silly. Examples of which would be the gross-out comedy from the palace meal; Shortround beating up fully-grown men, etc. All this stuff would be great in a film aimed solely at kids but then this isn't. It seems that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to alleviate the darker passages of the film but instead went too far in the other direction at some points. This leaves you with a strange concoction that doesn't actually know what it wants to be. It's a bit too silly for adults and too scary for children. It is a heck of alot of fun when it does work, however.

I would argue that Raiders is in fact the darkest in the series. Whilst it has that overriding sense of fun and a good portion of humour, the violence is played much straighter and the ominous, mysterious danger of the ark permeates the film (helped no end by Williams' great score).",1179878400,2,1837,4.631901840490798

Directed by Steven Spielberg. Story by George Lucas. Written by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz.

  This is the second film in the Indiana Jones series, however the story begins in Shanghai, 1935, one year before the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) mission.
  The movie begins with a lady nightclub singer, ""Willie"" (Kate Capshaw, who later married Steven Spielberg), performing in a musical production number that should have been filmed in Technicolor.
  Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is also in Club Obi Wan. He has to get these diamonds from Lao Che (Roy Chiao), but Lao poisons Indy and it becomes a brawl for the diamond and the antidote.
  Seems like Indy has a new lady partner for this adventure as he takes a hold of her hand and jumps out a window and ultimately is saved by his trusty 11-year old driver, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan, now Jonathon Ke Quan).  Earl (Dan Aykroyd) leads them to a getaway air freight airplane.  Lao Che has the last laugh. It's his plane.
  And so the adventure begins.  I won't tell you any more so that those who have not seen this film can be surprised.
  You might think you're watching a Charlie Chan film, a Satyajit Ray film, or Lost Horizon (1937).
  Ke Huy Quan steals every scene in this film.
  Many people thought this film was too gross for children to see. This inspired the MPAA to later invent a new rating ""PG-13"" and the adult ""NC-17"".
  Won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and nominated for Original Score.

Ke Huy Quan went on to do The Goonies (1985) and two tv series', Together We Stand / Nothing Is Easy (CBS, 1986-87) and Head of the Class: Season 5 (ABC. 1986-91).
  You can see how he looks today by buying a DVD of ""The Goonies"" with the on-screen video portion of the audio commentary turned on.  Now known as Jonathan Ke Quan, he is currently a martial arts coordinator for films.

133060,5,0792157850,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.""  I would highly recommend it.  Please keep this in mind, because I'm about to start telling its shortcomings.  None of these shortcomings diminish the five stars it earned.

This movie does pale compared to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark.""  Part of it is, as is often the case with sequels, it follows the formula of the first movie.  The formula here:  Indiana Jones has a close call trying to recover an artifact; he then discovers a more important mission.  After plenty of action, including dealing with creepy creatures (snakes in ""Raiders"", bugs in ""Temple Of Doom"") he gets into a fight, and launches into a thrilling chase sequence, before the climax of the movie.

Other weaknesses:  one, some of the scenes are obviously filmed inside instead of outdoors.  Also, George Lucas' interest in Hinduism has cropped up, as opposed to an object more of interest to Jews and Christians (i.e. the Ark of the Covenant).

While this does fit into the formula, this movie is unique.  For one thing, it pushed its PG ratings to the limit; in fact, this movie is one of the reasons the PG-13 rating came into being.  For another thing, I enjoyed Kate Capshaw more than any of the other love interests in this series.",1168473600,,1267,4.7
133061,4,0792157850,"Some movies in this world are so bad they're actually good. ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" is definitely an example.

This movie is certainly no match for its predecessor, the very serious ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"", but it is so hilarious it deserves 4 stars.

Will Indiana Jones stop the bad guys?

Will Kate Capshaw stop complaining for 5 minutes?",1150156800,2,350,4.704918032786885
133062,4,0792157850,"Alright. First off, I know I'm in the minority opinion by feeling this 2nd chapter is the best of the three. That said, I will explain why I feel this way. In part one, (in my opinion) the action was too brutal, and there wasn't much character development. (This may be because the character of Indiana Jones had not been fleshed out yet.) Second, the ending of Part one where all the 'bad guys' suddenly become wiped out was just too much.

The reason I feel Part 2 is the best is because in this chapter, Indiana Jones is a little more developed. Right away, we see that Indiana Jones (as good a person as he is) will operate outside the law if he sees fit. (Towards the middle of the movie, there is a dinner conversation where some of Indiana's unlawful activity is discussed, and he can't exactly deny it: ""Well...they exaggerated the incident."")

Sometimes the action and Indiana's narrow escapes are outside plausibility. But this is that kind of movie. I know a lot of people didn't like Kate Capshaw's character, but in all honesty, she fit in so nicely. What she provided was contrast. Indiana Jones is a man who is used to getting dirty and avoiding bullets. Kate Capshaw on the other hand is someone who doesn't even want to break a nail. So there are generous portions of comedy to speed up the movie and provide some contrast to the scenes that make us nervous. Though one really significant scene hints that she may be of use. (We all know Indiana is afraid of snakes; in the jungle a snake crawls on Capshaw, and without blinking, she grabs it and throws it.) Also, Kate Capshaw may be really sassy, but this provides another interesting contrast as well. As sassy as she is, she NEVER double crosses him. (If you saw Part 3, you know what I'm talking about.)

As if Kate Capshaw didn't help enough, Short Round is really memorable as the additional side kick. (His past also helps expand his character. His parents were killed in a bombing; Indiana caught him trying to steal from him; and he has taken up a life that may require him to operate outside the law from time to time.) The extremes of Indiana and Kate flatter each other well, and the presence of Short Round provides another dimension of comedy.

Moving on, the adventure starts in a plausible way. At first it seems that Indiana is after his own glory. Because he is not exactly altruistic, he is more plausible. But throughout the movie he does show moral development. True, the villain Mola Ram is a little under developed. This is one trilogy that doesn't really try hard to give the villains a good or sympathetic side. (Part 3 tried to some extent to expand the character of Elsa, but we won't go there.)

All in all, Part 2 has a wonderful balance of character development, suspense, horror, and comedy. I did enjoy Part 3, but I think there was something just so wonderful and magical about the Indiana Jones, Kate Capshaw, and Short Round chemistry.",1144540800,6,2938,4.546313799621928

133114,4,0792157850,"""Raiders of a lost ark"" was a thrill. I mean the suspense was just brilliant and the story was packed with surprises. This movie is not like that at all. You don't get the excitement you did in ""Raiders"". What's more it's scary, and I mean almost disturbing. The ceremonial scene is creepy, the candles are freaky and it looks like this could really be happening somewhere in a dark place. The movie deals with truly disturbing adult themes such as evil, drug addiction, witchcraft, child abuse, and torture. In ""Raiders"" you knew it was just a story. However, the scare in ""doom"" is not so much ""jumpy"" like in ""Raiders"", it is an uneasy feeling that sticks to you as soon as you enter the horrible hell hole. The intorduction of the chinese kid brings a lot of fun but the woman is irassible, and Dr Jones not convincing as a possessed by evil Indiana. The idea that children are working as slaves is definitely not a funny one. The roller coaster rides however really add a tone to the movie, they are cool, but a few scenes are downright fake. For example, the scene where the ceiling with spikes comes down is so false: it looks like it 's only about two meters and as soon as it is close to them, Spielberg lifts it up again to give time to the woman. Another example, the crocodile scene obviously shot in different locations because when taken from profile it looks like Indiana and his goons are standing on a little bridge over a creek. The guru character was not an interesting one, and the image that this film gives on Indians is more of a political one rather than a mysterious one, and I don't like this image.

But,...the beginning of the movie is one of the best action thriller beginnings of all time and just for uhe first aprt up to the point where the trio arrive in India, the movie deserves to be watched.",1124582400,4,1828,4.408284023668639
133115,4,0792157850,"""Temple of Doom"" is an exciting adventure story in the classic mold: exotic locations, thoroughly evil bad guys, wild chases, bloodless fights, and chaste romantic interest. There's a lot to like here, right down to the happy family reunions (!) at the end.

It's a sequel to the instant success of ""Lost Ark"". That's logical, given the popularity of the original and the versatility of the Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) character. This movie suffers a bit from the sequel syndrome, though. The ""screaming babe"" and ""cute kid"" characters are almost perfunctory - her job is mostly to squawk and get saved, the kid's job is mostly cuteness. Well, they do good enough jobs in their roles. Also, the Indiana character is developing in the direction of a James Bond - the first scene is in a high-priced cabaret, with Indy in an evening suit. Is that really our Indy?

There's a lot more humor than in the first movie, and that generally works well. The opening scene, an almost-familair cabaret song, prepares the viewer for later oddness. The initial scramble across the cabaret floor, too, is a good display of physical humor. ""Temple of Doom"" never seems to develop a split personality because of the disparate elements, though. They alternate well, without distracting from each other.

On the whole, this has stood up to the test of time. (Is it really 20 years since this came out?) The adventure story is good, the effects are all they need to be, and the mind can shift to low gear while watching. Enjoy!

133116,4,0792157850,"The scene opens in Shanghai, where incredibly sexy Wilhelmina (Willie) Scott (Kate Kapshaw) leads a stunning cabaret dance, only to be stolen by Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) , together with a very precious diamond, and an airplane, from a very powerful Chinese Mafia boss. All with the help of Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) , a streetwise little Chinese boy (with a very irritating voice!) , surely based on Chang from the Tin Tin books.

They land, seemingly by chance in a poverty-stricken Indian village, where all the children have been stolen away by a savage Thugee cult of Death. From there it is on to the Pankot Palace, before our friends descend into the pits of the hellish Temple of Doom, where they must rescue the poor enslaved children. Plenty of suspense and action, some quite gory scenes, comedy, and of course the romance between Indy and Willie, who really looked sexy in that outfit she was wearing when they came out of the mines.

133122,5,0792157850,"""Oh *h*t."" - Indiana Jones is deep in it when he discovers he is trapped on a rope bridge, courtesy of Thugee soldiers, that leads to freedom in ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"".
Steven Spielberg's first prequel, the blockbuster ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" is a rollercoaster ride that, after 20 years (and one day), is still effective long after its 5/23/84 release.
Taking place a year before the events in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Indiana Jones, with the help of his sidekick Short Round and lounge singer Willie Scott, does battle with a strong religous cult, known as the Thugee, trying to retrieve a sacred stone (called The Sankara Stone that is one of four stones, & if combined could make the Thugee all powerful) for a battered, decaying village. Along the way, Indy also frees the village's children that the cult has kidnapped (the kids are used for slave labor to dig for the missing fourth stone).
Much darker than ""Raiders"" (and is the dark heart of the trilogy), ""Temple of Doom"" doesn't let up until the last frame fadeout. The opening is a classic, with the Cole Porter song ""Anything Goes"", with ""Temple of Doom"" then taking a nose dive into its first big action sequence - an allout chaotic nightclub brawl that has Indiana searching for the antidote vial to the poison he drank while fighting off anything that gets in his way, including cigarette girls. The viewer also gets a crash course in avation (not a good one though, since Indy crashes the plane), a lesson on how to be more specific when ordering soup in a foreign country (just ask for broth, no eyeballs & also stick to munching on fruit), the correct way in waking someone up ""from the black sleep of the Kali"" (make sure to have a torch and lighter fluid handy), and Dr. Jones demonstrates the correct way on cutting a rope bridge (make sure to hang on...tight).
The film's production did have its problems.
Kate Capshaw didn't read the entire script before she got the part and was scared stiff to find out that some of her co-stars were going to be snakes and bugs. The scene where Willie falls off her elephant was cut short to her whining that she could lose her voice. In the original treatment of the script, Willie was to be surrounded in the mudpuddle with a bunch of snakes. Since Capshaw is deathly afraid of snakes (the day production was set to shoot the scene she was pale as a ghost and shaking) Spielberg opted to cut the scene from the film in exchange for the python, elephant trunk scene instead.
Harrison Ford had a severe herniated back problem after filming the fight between Indiana Jones and the Thugee Guard (the guard winds up getting hung up in the ceiling fan) in Indiana's quarters (the backflip while the guard is choking Ford is what caused the back problem). With Ford being out for 5 weeks, Jack Dearlove, Harrison Ford's stuntdouble, can be seen in all the long, tracking shots in the fight scene that leads up to the mine car chase (that includes the fight between Indiana and the huge Thugee Guard on the rock crusher). Ford and Spielberg did all the close up shots six weeks after shooting concluded on that particular sequence.
The film caused major controversy over the violent content in the film (an impaling, a hanging, and a heart sacrifice are heavy stuff for the PG going crowd). Spielberg went to Jack Valentii, the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and asked if there could be a middle ground between PG and R ratings. By the end of the summer of 1984, and with the release of the Patrick Swayze film ""Red Dawn"", the PG-13 rating was born.
I watched the film last night (the first time in a long time & to celebrate its 20th anniversary) and I still say that ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" is decent enough entertainment and belongs in any video library (preferably DVD).",1085356800,4,3846,4.583454281567489

To this day I'm surprised this movie didn't get an ""R"" rating. Although this film is the reason why there is a PG-13. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it doesn't give us a chance to breathe. It could have been a lot better if only it weren't so violoent and dark. Spielburg said himself that this was his least favorite of the Raiders films. Lucas also agreed that it was a bit too dark for it's own good. They wanted to make a different movie from Raiders of the Lost Ark and I guess this was just a little too different. Not the worst move ever made, but the least of the series.",1079395200,7,711,4.049645390070922
133194,4,0792157850,"After a film as critically and publicly praised as Raiders of the Lost Ark was, how does one make a follow up to it? That was the question on the minds of creators Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who, during the time leading up to and during Raider's success at the box office, continued to make names for themselves in Hollywood. In that time, Steven Spielberg directed quite possibly one of the most memorable films in his career, E. T. Extra-Terrestrial, while producer George Lucas wrapped up his highly successful Star Wars trilogy. Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, was reaping the benefits of success from both the Star Wars series as well as the first installment of Indiana Jones series and was eager for another go around with the hat and whip.  But what adventures awaited the adventurous archaeologist? The possibilities were limit-less but choosing the right one with just the right story elements proved to be more difficult then many would think.
The story takes place nearly a year before the events of the previous feature, Raider of the Lost Ark, and shows the venturesome archaeologist in rare form, not battling Nazis for once.  In 1935, we find the reckless Indiana Jones in China seeking an artifact from a dangerous Chinese businessman named Lao Che but in his turbulent escape with his child partner, Short Round, he becomes involved with a bombshell named Willie Scott, who ends up tagging along for the ride. The adventure places the group in a small village in India which finds itself under a curse after a group named the Maharajah of Pankot steals the sacred stone that has kept the town prosperous for hundreds of years. Not only that but it appears that at the same the time the stone was taken, all the children of the village mysteriously disappeared. The native shaman begs Indy to travel to Pankot Palace and discover the source of this unspeakable evil plot. After being welcomed grandly by maharajah, the trio discovers a secret passage that leads to the underground Temple of Doom, watched over by the evil Mola Ram, the high priest of a cult known as the Thuggees. Can the audacious adventurer find his way out of voodoo curses and perilous mines? The story for Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom is a decent outing for those looking for escapism but it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the original film. For one, the romantic angle between Indy and Willie Scott is lacking and doesn't match up to the one in Raiders. Secondly, the plot lacks the religious connection with the audience that Raiders and Crusade showcased, which is probably why it is the least enduring of the three films. And thirdly, as entertaining as he might, the addition of Short Round ends up being more of an annoyance then a plus to the story's plot line.
Another great thing about the Indiana Jones series is that it isn't afraid to switch up its supporting cast from film to film because the filmmakers know that the only thing that matters is how they interact with Harrison Ford on screen. Harrison Ford, who had just completed his stint as Hans Solo in Lucas' epic Star Wars series, gives another exhilarating performance as Indiana Jones and proves once again that he is fit for the role, no matter what is thrown at him in it. Ford works perfectly well by himself despite the annoyances of Kate Capshaw and Ke Huy Quan. Kate Capshaw, who would later marry director Steven Spielberg, just doesn't fit well into this film at all. Her hysterics come off as being more annoying then hilarious and she lacks chemistry when paired up romantically with Harrison Ford. Ke Huy Quan, who performs as Short Round in the film, is another case of a character being more of an annoyance and a distraction then an increment. Sure, his attitude and the way he speaks might be humorous, cute even, as the feature starts out but as it progresses, patience wares thin especially in the more serious aspects of the film.
Overall, Temple of Doom continues the thrilling adventures of Indiana Jones but fails to surpass the standards set by Raiders of the Lost Ark just a few years before. Unlike the previous installment, the supporting cast is more of a hindrance then anything else and just doesn't compliment the wonderful performance given by Harrison Ford. Also unlike Raiders, Doom lacks the romantic integrity and the religious implications that made the series so enduring to movie-goers. The darker overtones also alienate many who had grown accustomed to the series' light-hearted fare but not to such an extent that it ruins the experience entirely who do sit down and watch it. Despite its obvious inferior enduring quality behind Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom remains an entertaining feature for Harrison Ford's engaging performance and the beautiful landscapes alone.",1077408000,3,4814,4.819830713422007
133195,4,0792157850,"""Temple of Doom"" takes a lot of heat from fans and enemies of the Indian Jones Trilogy alike.  Many complain about its dark-quality and its overemphasis of action, but personally I find it more enjoyable to watch than ""Raiders.""  I enjoy the somewhat darker tones of this film; I can remember this movie scaring me more as a child than ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did.  Additionally, I think Spielberg and Lucas were up to form in this film (though, admittedly not as smooth as they were on the final film).  Harrison Ford appears to have finally discovered who Indiana truly is.  While the movie does lack a developed villain, Indiana Jones gets more character development.  The addition of Shortround gives the film a different feel too; once again, we see our big action star being aided and saved by a young child (far from the perfect action heroes that have graced the screens in recent years).
The opening sequence of this film-involving a musical set piece, dancing, and a good old-fashioned gunfight-is one of the best sequences in the entire trilogy.  Watching Indiana scramble around for the antidote after being poisoned is wonderfully done and strung out.  Additionally, the sequence in the room full of spikes (particularly when the sequence goes into a mini-repeat) is hilarious and exciting.  And although the Indiana girl in this film (played by Kate Capshaw) becomes quickly annoying, the characters in the film are equally annoyed as the audience.
All around, ""Temple of Doom"" knows what it is doing and has the whole show more organized and choreographed than the first film.  If you haven't seen this film, get it.  You'll thank me.",1069718400,6,1651,4.881720430107527
133196,4,0792157850,"After the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, series creator George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg took the Indiana Jones series into its dark second installment, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
Written by American Graffiti's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and set in 1935 (making this film a prequel to the first film), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom takes its archaeologist hero (Harrison Ford) from a swank Shanghai night club to the rain forest of India as Indy, his orphaned sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and his very reluctant companion Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, who would later be Mrs. Steven Spielberg) go on a quest for an Indian village's sacred stone, which has been stolen by evil Thugee followers of the Kali cult.
Indy is at first reluctant to go on this quest for yet another mythical artifact, but when the villagers tell the archaeologist and his two companions that the followers of Kali, now based in Pankot Palace, have stolen their children, Jones agrees to pay the new Maharajah of Pankot a visit.  His interest is peaked when a dying young escapee arrives at the village and hands Indy a scrap of cloth with a fragment of tapestry.  Reading its Sanskrit inscription and by looking at the pictographs on the cloth, Indiana discovers that the villagers' sacred stone is one of five Sankara stones, left to men by the Hindu god Shiva.  When a puzzled Short Round asks Indy what a Sankara stone represents, the professor/adventurer replies, ""Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.""
But Indy's quest for ""fortune and glory"" takes a disturbing turn when the trio reaches Pankot Palace.  The prime minister, Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth) appears to be just another Oxford-trained Indian bureaucrat, but in reality he's one of Kali priest Mola Ram's (Amrish Puri) lieutenants.  Soon, Indy, Short Round and Willie go from honored guests to prisoners when they discover the goings-on behind the high walls of Pankot Palace.
Although Temple of Doom is an enjoyable adventure film, its dark tones (both in storytelling and visual terms) and a few gory scenes involving a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice made it the least favorite entry in the series.  And even though it was rated PG, the criticism Temple of Doom received caused director Spielberg to be one of the advocates of the PG-13 rating that the Motion Picture Association of America created within months of the film's release.
Nevertheless, the film's action set pieces (some of them conceived for Raiders but left out for time constraints) are still thrilling, Spielberg's directing is top-notch and John Williams' 1930s-flavored musical score is, as always, brilliant.  Although the other two films in the series are more fun and lighter in tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is still worth watching.
Just not, of course, right after dinner.

133197,4,0792157850,"Since it OBVIOUSLY wasn't directed by Spielberg, credits or no. This film was everything the first Indy movie claimed to be and wasn't: A rollicking, enjoyable, edge-of-your-seat matinee movie with thrill-a-minute action, funny situations and good character interplay.
This is a prequel to ""Raiders"" which finds Indy wearing his glasses for only about five minutes of the story. It starts OUT as an adventure, rather than leads up to one.
The film opens in a Chinese lounge where Indy is to meet up with a wealthy Chinese merchant after completing an assignment for him to obtain the remains of the first emperor of the Manchu dynasty. Indy enters the movie very James Bond-like, coming down a sprial staircase to the table where the merchant, Lao Che, has just finished watching a floor show by Willie, played by Spielberg's present golddigger wife, Kate Capshaw, and her girls.
The double cross starts almost immeidately as Lao Che tries to poison Indy to keep from paying him with a VERY large diamond for his troubles. Indy gets desperate, as it's revealed that Lao Che ALSO possesses the ANTIDOTE for the poison, to be given when he turns over the diamond. To try to force Lao Che to give up the antidote, Jones does something very unheroic by threatening to disembowel Willie if he doesn't turn it over, holding an olive fork to her side.
What follows is pure chaos as Lao Che reveals that his sons have a bead on him, assuring Indy's cooperation. HOWEVER, Indy knew his client well enough to be prepared with his OWN backup gunsel, disguised as a waiter in the club. Immediately after this, somebody pops a champagne cork, causing some antsy soul to fire a gun, killing Indy's friend, etc., etc. until the room is awash in fistfights and bullets. Indy takes Willie, escapes from the club behind a rolling gong he cuts down to protect them from the gunplay, leaps out the window of the club ""Obi Wan"", and the adventure in under way in earnest, as Indy's ""tween"" Korean sidekick, Short Round, is introduced as the driver of his getaway car.
The three end up making tracks out of China, (or is it Hong Kong?) via a plane, which, ironically enough, is OWNED by Lao Che, unbeknownst to Indy and his friends.
To give away more will blunt your enjoyment of this movie, which indeed takes you on a ride from the very start. It's obvious that Lucas directed this film in pretty much the same way Spielberg directed/influenced ""Poltergeist"" and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" (the latter a near DOUBLE to IJATTOD in plotline and main character allotment.) Indy is, in fact, a Lucas creation, in collaboration with Philip Kauffman, and BOTH of these guys can direct rings around Spielberg!
The clues are obvious: just like Star wars, ""Temple of Doom"" has a taller, older hero, a younger hero, a spunky love interest that initially HATES the older hero then grows fond of him, with all of them threatened by a VERY evil cult/organization in a quasi-mystical setting. Spielberg xeroxed this formula in ""Young Sherlock Holmes"", which he produced, and which Barry Levinson is credited with directing.
Just remember, if, like me, you CRINGE at the thought of any movie directed by Steven Spielbucks, that in THIS movie, he was little more than the hand puppet Lucas used to tell the actors where to stand. ILM pretty much handled the rest of the film...",1053043200,,3338,4.77681660899654
133198,2,0792157850,"One scene in TOD in particular drives me crazy every time I watch this movie.  Remember when Indy, Short Round, and Willie are riding along in the rickety mining car over vast crevasses in the Temple?  Remember how deep those ravines were?  Okay, now fast forward to the next scene, where a giant bucket of water is dumped down the tunnel.  It is a big bucket, don't get me wrong, but anyone who has studied physics and spatial relations knows that the water would fill in the cracks first and there is NO WAY that the amount of water (which was much smaller than the volume of the main area of the temple which in turn is much smaller than the volume of the mining ravine) would 1. fill in all of the ravine, 2. explode with enough force to travel laterally over the ravine, or 3. come through with so much force that the water would break through the rock wall.  A couple simple changes would have made the whole thing a little more plausible: instead of a bucket, why couldn't it have been a dammed river? (And yes, I am speaking of a DAMMED river, not the vernacular).  If the dam were to burst, I would still have some objections to its plausibility but I would at least have enough to willingly suspend disbelief.  Another thing.  Indy's biggest problem would not have been rushing water, it would have been the incredible amount of STEAM!!! Remember the swirling lava at the bottom of the ravine?  But of course, steam makes make-up run and hairspray fall, so Willie couldn't have a steam bath on the side of the cliff, now could she?  It wouldn't have looked good in the previews.
By no means is that the only scene that makes me scratch my head.  The whole thing seems rather Western-centric... It seems like the message of the movie is this: ""Look at those crazy brown people worshipping rocks!  Look at the disgusting things they eat!  Look at how they drink blood and rip out people's hearts... Now, hurray!  The white came and freed the savages' children... Now everybody is happy!  Isn't the white man swell?""  I'm sure that wasn't the film makers' intent but still...
All that said, I didn't hate the movie.  It has some major flaws and is by far the weakest of the three.  It seemed like it was trying too hard to out-do the original... more gross, more action, more danger, etc. and it turned out to be much much less.",1047945600,4,2335,4.4541176470588235
133199,5,0792157850,"The second and possible my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy ""Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom"" brings the archaeologist teacher and adventurer from the Nazi-controlled Germany to the tropical jungles of India to wage a battle against a secret underground cult. Quite possibly the darkest and most controversial of the three, ""Temple Of Doom"" is in fact, my favorite of them and is one of Spielberg's crowning achievements in his entire career. The only trilogy that tops this in my opinion is the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I sometimes like this more than Star Wars but then again, it's a toss-up between the two.
It all starts in 1935, four years after the Lost Ark decimated the bad guys and caused the spectacular demise of poor Belloq and his gang, in Shanghai where Jones meets an internationally renowned singer by the name of Willie and makes a deal with a Chinese gangster leader named Lou Che and then the deal goes sour and they flee from Mr. Che's thugs on a plane. Things don't go as planned though and the plane goes down and the threesome find themselves in the tropical jungles of India where they head to a village where all of its children were kidnapped and their religious stones called Shan Kara Stones by some unknown group. Eventually that unknown group they come face to face is a dark, secret underground society called the Thuggie Cult led by Mola Ram where they perform satanic rituals worshipping Kali and use child slavery to dig in the secret underground mines to mine for diamonds to make more Shan Kara stones in the rituals. It is just mind-boggling how they manage to film some scenes considering that some places in India are forbidden from being filmed or photographed. Some of the places though in the movie are breathtaking especially the underground caves and the stunts in some of the chambers are just enough to make one hold onto the edge of their seats. This movie broke ground with some of the best action sequences that I've ever seen in a movie even to this very day especially towards the last half hour of the movie.
I think that ""Temple Of Doom"" is probably the best of the three with its suspenseful and malicious plot, and the stunning directing by none other than Steven Spielberg. Some of the background music is incredibly haunting, thus amplifying the dark undertones of the movie. I consider the second Indiana Jones movie to be Spielberg's crowning achievement and one of the best adventure films of all-time and even one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom"" would've been perfect had it not been for the excessive cowardice in Willie's character. Mary in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was awesome and semi-rebellious and it made her such a classic, but Willie is just an annoying and helpless damsel always in need to be rescued and that keeps IJATTOD from being perfect. I think that Willie should've been more heroic but trying to put some positive things in my opinion, it's almost funny how she screams at petty things like bats, or snakes or mere lizards. Quite frankly the screaming can be annoying at times. It would've been so much better if Willie had a more 'tough', and 'tomboyish' charisma like Mary did in Raiders. Oh well. Then again, it's good to have a change in some of the characters and even Willie can be fun at times too. Mola Ram though is just awesome with his evil expression and laughing. Lou Che at the beginning of the movie was another classic one even though he wasn't a main character in the movie but his lines though and the rivalry with Jones was classic. The underground mine chase scene is one of the best action sequences that I've ever seen in my life. It boggles my mind how they managed to film that.
This film created controversy back in its release year and was greeted with mixed reviews from the critics and from fans because of its much darker subject. Many have said that it was too violent and more graphic but the makers of the film said that it was no more violent than Raiders was. Also, it got a lot of negative press from civil rights groups because of it portraying Indians (People of India) as poor, and bloodthirsty, and India as a desperately poor country, neither of which are true at all. India today is a blossoming democracy with lots of large thriving cities. Also it portrayed them as villainous killers with their Thuggee Cult with human sacrifice rituals and then the British as the saviors that come and save the day and even I cannot deny being somewhat taken aback by that. To the detractors, I say Boo Hoo! European colonists during the Colonial Era killed millions of Native Americans in North and South America by disease and forced population movements and also killed or enslaved Aboriginals in Australia and also of Blacks in Africa with the same or similar tactics so basically, every nationality on Earth has been either the savior or the villain! Get it?
Anyway, despite the controversy and the negativity, it went on to become another blockbuster at the box office and it deserved the success it got. It's hard for me to say if this one or ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is better but whatever weakness the two had are complemented though and I think it results in a draw between the two as my second favorite behind ""The Last Crusade"". Yes, some of the scenes can be too much for younger viewers, but hey, I loved this movie when I was just 6 years old, that's right, just 6 years old, and now at the age of 20, it's now one of my all-time favorite movies and is a highly recommend classic that must be included in every movie-watchers collection. I only wished that this trilogy would've continued into the 1990s or even to the present as the follow-up ""The Last Crusade"" was a dynamite follow-up to ""Temple of Doom"". Anyhow, fasten your seatbelts as you'll be in for a h.e.l.l. of a ride!",1045785600,3,5856,4.604784688995215
133200,4,0792157850,"Of the three Indiana Jones pictures, this one is possibly the best.  The first one might have had a more far-reaching plot (I mean, how do you top the wrath of God?), and the third was just a laughable (not a compliment) parody of itself.  But ""Temple of Doom"" is my favorite because there are several stretches of the movie that have so much action you literally don't have time to catch your breath.  The timing of these scenes and the stunt coordination are done so well I can't think of a movie that has done this better.
The only irritation, and unfortunately it's a major one, is the Kate Capshaw character (say that fast ten times).  I can see comic relief at certain points in a movie, but her role is used WAY too much.  Her constant whining and screeching in practically every scene she's in gets irritating much too quickly, and unfortunately, continues for the entire movie.  I don't blame her, I blame the plot, and the movie would have been much better had she been a stronger character.
But this is not to take away from otherwise a very fine adventure.  The opening sequence opens with a lavish stage production, which leads to a double-crossing situation between Jones and the shady owner of the club.  It takes off from there with an exciting scramble for both a diamond and a vial of poison antidote.  The thrills don't  end until Jones needs to figure out how to get out of the middle of a rope bridge with the enemy coming from both sides and hungry crocodiles several hundred feet below.  Even with the point I don't like, this is still an action film for the ages.",1044748800,,1587,4.475694444444445
133201,4,0792157850,"The most underrated film of the franchise, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is actually superior in terms of action than LAST CRUSADE. Technically a prequel, the film is much darker in tone than it's predecessor, but nonetheless is an exciting entry in the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Night club action, mine car chases and the thrilling climax on a perilous rope bridge, the set-pieces are some of the most memorable in the trilogy. Set before RAIDERS, Harrison Ford is great in one of his best movie roles, Indiana Jones, obtainer of rare antiquities. And this time, it's Shankara stones for the looting, and while the story isn't as original as it's predecessor, it provides some great comic book-style action. Although directed by Spielberg, George Lucas is the creator of  Indiana Jones, and this is one of Spielberg's most impersonal films. However there are some nice homages to JAWS and the ""Just shoot 'em"" gag from RAIDERS. The opening Busby Berkley inspired number ""Anything Goes"" sums up the pace for the whole film, where the characters go from one action set-piece to the next, with little space for a breather. The female lead Kate Kapshaw (Willie Scott) is not as spunky as Marion Ravenwood, but she's handles being a love interest for Indy and comic relief rather well. There is a notable lack of meaty villians, with Mola Ram not reaching the excellent ""Bad guy"" heights of Belloq, but hey, he's still nasty enough. Determined not to make Indy a cardboard character, this one explores Indy's dark side and audience limitations. However despite the change in tone for TOD, there are many laughs to be had and some clever in-jokes, the best of which is the nightclub where Willie sings: Club Obi Wan. Genius. Addmitedly, in some scenes taste goes out the window in favour of revolting animal delacacies and human sacrafice. After all, this was the film that started the PG:13 rating for films that were too violent for a simple PG. But what most critics fail to realise is that it's comic book violence, making it not as bad. John William's tonal score is darker than his previous efforts like E.T, but it's still one of his best. And minor carping aside, they don't make action films like this anymore, where the characters aren't crowded out by a barrage of CGI (THE MUMMY). To put it simply, the action, mine car chases, one-liners and monkey brains all combine to make a really fun action film. And while it dosn't reach the excellent heights of  RAIDERS, it's still one amazing adventure.",1043280000,5,2508,4.8032407407407405
133202,5,0792157850,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has caught a LOT of flack over the years since its first release. It's hard to say whether or not the criticism has died down a bit; the movie sure does seem to have its fan base. Admittedly, not all the stated faults are unfair or have no justification; this is indeed the most flawed of the Indiana Jones adventures. But as such, a deeply flawed Jones outing is still likely more fun than the next dozen summerblockbusters you're likely to see all year long.
Set in 1935 (meaning this is a prequel to Raiders), Harrison Ford once again stars as our titular hero, this time in a Chinese nightclub, making a trade for a valuable diamond. Things don't go as planned and an all-out brawl ensues, finally resulting in Jones, singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), and kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) on the run from a Chinese gang. They eventually take off on a plane carrying poultry cargo, but the pilots happen to work for the leader of that gang Jones had the run in with.
Thus, Jones and his two partners are stuck in India, where they arrive at a devastated village. Investigating further, Jones decides to head to Pankot Palace, which seems to be the source of the problem. There he discovers the renewed Thugee Cult, bent on world domination with the complete collection of the Sankara Stones. Just what these stones will do...the movie doesn't specify. But this all leads to Indiana Jones kicking [butt], and lots of it, too.
The somewhat lukewarm response Temple of Doom initially received wasn't surprising. As the sequel to (at the time) the greatest action movie in existence, there's a lot to live up to. I, for one, was not disappointed. The movie promised a breathless thrill ride and it delivered one. And where else are you going to see elaborate booby traps and exotic settings?
Temple of Doom's first half is sensationally entertaining, actually about the equal of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie's opening action sequence is a knockout, and the scenes afterward find the right touch of creepiness to make for an intriguing story. It only gets better when they reach Pankot Palace, as we witness the classic dinner scene, truly funny romantic interaction between Jones and Willie, and a spike-filled booby trap scene that is alternately suspenseful and hilarious, thanks to Ford's dead-on reaction (""We are going to Die!"").
It's the second half that isn't as successful. Once Jones actually encounters the Thuggee Cult, things get rather unpleasant. The sight of children being whipped stops the fun to a dead halt, and there's a fairly graphic depiction of a man whose heart is removed...by hand. These scenes are also set underground, which makes for a very grimy and dark setting, not necessarily the best for an adventure movie.
But thankfully, things pick up significantly for the final half-hour, which is arguably the most exciting extended action sequence of the whole trilogy. It all begins with thrilling fistfights and whip-swinging, then turns to a rollercoaster ride on a minecart, then concludes on a shaky bridge overlooking a river full of alligators. The action is wildly thrilling and breathtaking, featuring awesome stunts and brilliant cinematography (particularly during the minecart chase). There's also one shot which features Jones standing poised right before he knocks out a villain (off-screen) that's probably the coolest single scene in the whole series.
Interestingly enough, Temple of Doom happens to be the only Jones film that ends on an action sequence; in this case, we get four. How can anyone complain about that, especially considering just how damned entertaining these action scenes are? Yeah, there are a few implausibly silly moments, especially the scene where Willie and Short Round cross an entire bridge without noticing the villain on the other side. But such contrivances are forgivable given just how viscerally exciting the movie is.
John Williams' score nicely reuses the Raiders march theme to great effect. The other themes in the score are nicely done, a fitting match to the movie's tone and pacing. The special effects and production values are mostly excellent, only the imposition of the alligators at the end is slightly unconvincing. Otherwise, the movie looks like it could have just been released for the first time yesterday.
Where Temple of Doom definitely improves over Raiders is the humor quotient, which is a few notches higher in quantity and quality here. Harrison Ford's performance contributes highly to this factor, just note his reaction to a threat off-screen (you'll know what I'm talking about, it's the scene right after he dispatches of two swordfighters). I think we're all in agreement when we say no one else could have played this role half as well as Ford. It's the part he was born for, and he's absolutely terrific. As for Kate Capshaw, she can be loud and annoying, but I actually prefer her over Karen Allen, if only because she and Ford have better chemistry together.
At any rate, The Temple of Doom is still great fun, and certainly superior to any bit of escapist entertainment Hollywood's churned out the past several months. Apparently, Spielberg didn't much like this film, so The Last Crusade was his atonement. He didn't need to apologize, but it's nice to see his apology wound up being the best action film I've ever seen. By the way, has anybody else wondered how Indiana Jones managed to retrieve his brown coat (which was left in the cave) and still get ahead of the children at the end?",1038614400,4,5550,4.917910447761194
133203,5,0792157850,"It's impossible for me to review this film without constantly bringing up how ridiculous it is, but don't get me wrong - I honestly love ""Temple of Doom."" It's probably the most watchable of the Indiana Jones series, although it follows the same formula of beginning with the tiniest shred of legendary trivia and developing it into an elaborate excuse for blowing up obscenely expensive movie sets. In this case we're looking for the ""lost Sankara Stones,"" which may or may not have precedence in some Hindu scripture - it doesn't really matter, does it? In fact, we're only looking for them because our plane happened to crash over the remote village in India from which they were taken. And we were only on that plane because we were fleeing sinister diamond-theiving assassins in China...this is how the plot unfolds in an Indiana Jones movie. It's as simultaneously contrived and irrational as ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" yet it takes itself seriously.
Well...more or less. The real secret to the success of these films is that they interject moments of (what they know the audience will identify as) ""humor"" in with the ""action."" Along for comic relief on this ride are spoiled blond stock-character #36 ""Willie Scott"" and Asian orphan stock-character #61 ""Short Round,"" the ""love-interest"" and the ""kid"" respectively, convenient but disposable (remember Marion Ravenwood?) sidekicks for ""Indy"" to exchange deadpan remarks with in between karate chops. Willie is excruciatingly whiny and Short Round is an obnoxious brat - yeah, so? Somebody has to complicate the plot by screwing things up for our hero every once in a while. They're basically a couple of useless liabilities, but noble Indy will defend them to the death (or at least to the end of the film) and that's why we love him, blah blah blah.
Anyway, this A-team I've just described winds up riding elephant-back up the hill from the village to the local effeminate 10-year-old Majarajah's palace for a spectacularly offensive supper of beetles and brains. And the palace, as luck would have it, is actually the back-door to a colossal inner temple of Kali run by a supposed reconstitution of the Thugghi cult. It is this cult that stole the Stones from the village - oh, along with all the village children, just in case you wouldn't have been emotionally invested enough in the rocks alone to care. The children, you see, have been set to slave-labor in the mines, searching for the last two Sankara Stones because the complete set will render the Thugghi all-powerful - how trite can you get? And once again, who cares. Nobody's wanting or expecting deep (or any) thought here. Just rip out a few hearts, jump off a few bridges, blow up lots and lots of stuff, and nobody's gonna complain. Indy and Co. manage to singlehandedly take on the entire cult of hundreds of insane and bloodthirsty fanatics (read: ""heathens"") and emerge without a scratch - improbable? They succeed in destroying the Thugghi, returning the Stones to Shiva if not to the village (after all it WAS rather materialistic of those villagers to cling to such trinkets), and, of course, freeing the enslaved children - you buy it? Well fortunately you don't have to - the movie buys it for you wholesale, just so that you can have that final shot of all the kids running back into the village and reuniting with their parents to a soaring theatrical score as Indy and Willie make out 30's style and Short Round rolls his eyes, and then your whole family can leave satisfied and fulfilled with smiles on your faces, since the movie has so deftly targeted the soft spots of every possible demographic in one fell swoop.
But don't get me wrong....
They really don't make movies like this anymore. Today's audience is jaded beyond this level of corny...they're on to a whole new post-postmodern level of corny. Nowadays we have films like ""The Scorpion King"" with its CGI hordes and generic pro-wrestler personalities, which are essentially Puffy-remix variations on Indiana Jones themes. ""Temple of Doom"" is a uniquely 80's phenomenon. Yet it remains intensely absorbing if only as a parade of lunatic images.",1037404800,3,4144,4.912981455064194
133244,5,0792157850,"First of all, this film takes place in pre WW II history, perfectly setting up a more lush and exotic (Nazi-free) environ for the story to unfold. What really makes this movie a good time though, and a feast for movie fans, is it's countless references and homages to everything from Star Wars to The Thief Of Bagdad. But it's not just the in the references... the whole tone and feel is closer to a 70's Italian horror film in lusty embrace with a B serial from the 40's.  Instead of retreading the first one Spielberg and Lucas amped up the colors, matte paintings, grizzly effects and freaky  scares to create a delerious explosion of pulp vivacity. Raiders was the intro (so pretty tasteful in it's style), Last Crusade is a more family friendly and vanilla concoction, probably hastened by some family's outraged cries after seeing Temple. But boldened by the success of the first one -- Temple of Doom is the chapter that was made for FILM FANS and FILMMAKERS.

133245,3,0792157850,"I was somewhat disappointed with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. After having seen the first in the series, Raiders of the Lost Ark, I was looking forward to more lighthearted entertainment. Sadly, however, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom had several elements which really annoyed me.
First of all, although it had its funny and exciting moments (especially the first scene in the nightclub when Indy is searching for the antidote to the poison he drank), this movie was essentially too violent for its own good. I don't mind a good action movie, but when the action element is excessive it becomes aggravating. I feel that Raiders, which had less action (and less gruesome action) was far better. Some may disagree...but I think this movie had TOO MUCH violence for an Indiana Jones movie (I expect less violence, more humor).
Most importantly, the basic premise of the movie was pretty racist. Essentially, Spielberg based this movie on a 1938 classic adventure, Gunga Din, which starred Cary Grant. I have seen Gunga Din: it is a movie that condones, if not fully supports, imperialism. In many ways, it is still a good movie - but the ideas in it have to be ignored completely. Now, that movie was made in 1938. Although not great, having imperialist propaganda in a movie made in 1938 is SOMEWHAT understandable. But this movie was made in 1984! Things should have improved...the view of foreign countries as barbaric and savage is no longer acceptable!
Don't get me wrong - I like Indiana Jones movies. But Temple of Doom is my LEAST favorite because it has 2 big flaws: too much violence, and the idea of foreign countries as inferior. That is why I could only give it 3 stars. Come on...let's not be stuck in the 1930s...there are dozens of other, non-offensive, plots that Spielberg could have used. Oh well. Luckily we have the other 2 Indy movies to remind us how much fun adventure movies can be! So don't get this movie, get the other 2.",1026432000,2,1961,4.703488372093023

133247,4,0792157850,"As stated many times, the second film of the Indiana Jones trilogy is (by far) the darkest of the series. While Raiders was an extremely fun viewing of Dr. Jones having a fistfight with the entire German army, and Last Crusade was a lighthearted quasi-Parsifal with Sean Connery, Temple of Doom is a tense, truly disturbing (at times) adventure that takes place in an underground pit just a few feet above hell. And it's my favorite of the Indy movies.
Harrison Ford is brilliant in the role that he was born to play. Although the character of Indy is shrouded in macho trappings, this IS set in the thirties. So, I don't find the supposed ""sexism"" to be all that off-putting. Ford's considerable acting skills are greatly tested by Temple. There's a scene where Indy is being tortured by members of the evil Thuggee cult, and the viewer is absolutely disturbed by the scene. A lesser actor would have made this an exercise of pure camp.
Kate Capshaw is, quite frankly, a little annoying as Willie Scott. I don't think it's necessarily Capshaw's fault; her character could have been played by Audrey Hepburn and still would have been irritating. Willie, as remarked by some reviewers, screams her head off during most of the movie. Eventually, you kind of hope the bugs or the lava will finish her off. Still, some scenes with the character work. The opening sequence and Willie's behavior at the palace are charming.
Ke Huy Quan is pretty good as Short Round, Indy's temporary sidekick. Again, it's the character that is a bit distracting, not the actor. Ke Huy Quan is delightful in the poker scene with Indy in the jungle and is much more of a help than Willie could ever be, but some of the scenes of Short Round kicking the poop out of the cult members are a little laughable.
Amrish Puri is wonderful as the awfully evil Mola Ram. This guy makes Belloq look like Maurice Chevalier with such an intensely evil leer and rather septic heart operation procedures. Roshan Seth is also brilliant as the devious prime minister. Both of these fine actors are also in the wonderful movie ""Gandhi.""
Philip Stone's character is something of a Col. Blimp, yet a very well acted Col. Blimp. I'm sure he probably listens to Elgar while sipping his tea in his bath. The rest of the supporting cast are also excellent: Lao Che and the Indian holy men are very enjoyable, if a bit one-dimensional.
The accusations of the film being racist are, in my opinion, a little silly. Yes, Hinduism is much more tolerant of a religion than Christianity could ever hope to be. As far as I know, there wasn't ever a Kali cult that performed human sacrifices, and it can be easily and convincingly argued that British rule in India was mostly malign. However, stating that all of the Indians in the film are portrayed as weak or devious is like stating that all the Germans in the other two films are portayed as cruel and militaristic. I can understand a person's sensitivity to such things, but since it's an Indy movie, naturally Indy is going to be portrayed as the wonderful savior while everyone else is reduced to being either dependent on him or actively trying to dispatch him. In my opinion, problems do arise when people (typically Americans) see movies like this and take them as real history. For instance, many Americans who have seen Braveheart now consider themselves experts on Scottish history. Occasionally, when I eat Indian food (which is delicious), I hear some bozo talking about eating monkey's brains, as was also stated by another reviewer. I can understand a person of Indian heritage being very irritated by such behavior, but I don't think it's entirely fair to blame the filmmakers for the behavior of some of the more stupid people who watch their movies. Hopefully, in the next Indiana Jones film, Indy will take on the scariest religious cult yet: America's religious Right. I can think of a certain self-righteous someone who could use a few good punches.",1024099200,6,3965,4.73121387283237

FUNNIER: ""Temple of Doom"" is much funnier that ""Raiders."" Kate Capshaw is hilarious and ""Short Round"" is a nice touch.

The other two films have people getting run over, blown up, diced by airplane propellors, melted, etc. Granted the chilled monkey brains are a bit much, but the beautiful locations kind of make up for this, and I think the mine-car chase on the tracks is one of the best action sequences of all time. It seems to have inspired a couple of computer animation videos.",1007596800,2,499,4.4945054945054945

But I also forgot to mention Indys seacond (Actually first, its one of the first ""Prequels"" ever made, taking place 10 years before the origional) adventure.  Doom is one of if not the best Action films of all time.  There is infinitly more action then Raiders could ever provide and a good story.  Indy is still as lovable as ever, with the addition of the neat Short round and the unfortunate addition of Indys new girlfriend (Can you spot Steven spielberg and George Lucas as hidden charachters?).  The story, while weak, is still good, with Indy trying to save kids from a thugge cult.  The action is unprecidented, with nifty special effects and a great pacing of it.  The bridge finalie is fantastic, and will make your heart stop at some points.  John Wiliams returns to try and make up for Raiders with his great moving soundtrack that fits well with the action.  Granted, this film is gresome in some points and is not for little kids, but this is still a fantastic action film.
The good: Its a Indy flick, Lots of satisfying action, great special effects, good story.
The bad: Parts of extreame violence and gore

Kate Capshaw turns in the most annoying female performance of all time and the young boy - short round - is the worst kid character of all time. The opening scene is wonderful fun but it's all downhill from there. A truly horrible film, not because it's boring and uninteresting (which it is) but because it's just so damn annoying.

 Sandwiched between the perfect ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the almost-as-good-and-it-has-Sean Connery ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" "" Doom"" aims to thrill and succeeds mainly in annoying. The opening sequence mines James Bond (the model for this series according to Steven Spielberg) territory, but soon the flick devolves into mindless escapism and- even worse- racism. Spielberg maligns the entire Indian subcontinent in several scenes. If this had been done with malicious intent, that'd be pretty bad; instead, it was done so Spielberg could gross out the kids in the audience by showing a fat guy eating monkey brains, which is even worse.

While Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood was a two-fisted hellraiser, Scott is a pampered indoor brat, and in turn is brilliant, plus her character is quite funny also, as is Short Round. Amrish Puri is a chilling as the villainous cult leader.

Douglas Slocombe's photography is more effective, and John Williams' music score is even more diverse and genius. Temple of Doom is also more creative, emotionally effective, and imaginative. However, it lacks the spectacle of the first film and is far more controversial and violent. This is the movie that created the PG-13 rating.

133373,5,0792157850,"Well, Temple Of Doom is not quite what RAIDERS was, but still a highly entertaining film.  What I can't stand most are the people who hate this film simply because of the fact that it is a sequel, or should I say  ""prequel"", as the events in TEMPLE OF DOOM take place two years  prior to the events in RAIDERS.  The story is a little different this time  around; instead of battling nazis, Jones is battling a pegan colt after the  legendary shonkara stones, replacing (but not outdoing) the search for the  biblical ARK OF THE COVENANT.  The characters are a little more shallow in  this one, but far more convincing than anything by today's standerds (i.e.  TITANIC).  The villians are even a little scarier, especially  blood-curdling are the many SHEVA worshipers, who insist on using small  children as slaves to recover the lost stones.  The scene inwhich a man's  heart is literally ripped out from his chest was enough to inspire a PG-13  rating, which brings me to my next point.  Those of you out there who  insist that this film is too violent for children, I urge you to go to your  local cinema, and experience something far worse than what this picture has  to offer.  I hate to admit it, but I've seen some DISNEY films even more  violent than this film, and I'm actually kind of suprised at the  controversy this film developed.  All and all, TEMPLE OF DOOM hits it right  on all the elements.  The story is captivating, though less so than  RAIDERS, the acting is fine, film editing is impecable, production design  is extraordinary like RAIDERS, the visual effects were enough to garner an  academy award, the sound effects where once again phonomenal, and the music  score is actually much more deverse in my opinion, than the one featured in  RAIDERS.  What I like about this score is how the RAIDERS MARCH is utilized  so many times, and crammed in to so many situations...it adds much more  flare to the film, and is one of JOHN WILLIAM'S greatest musical  acheivements.  Now available in widescreen for the first time, the print is  impressivly clear, and is definatly well worth the purchase, at least until  the dvd release comes out.  This is actually one of the first films I  watched when we got our surround sound system.  It sounds superb in dolby,  for a vhs, and the action often passes from left to right, subwolfer, and  above.  Once again, another great action film from LUCAS and SPIELBERG,  followed by a rousing sequal.  Most memorable scenes would have to be the  opening night club scwabble over the antidote, the creature feature dinner,  the sacrificial heart removing sequence, Mine Cart Chase, and the grand  finale bridge crossing scene, very, very, impressive.

Although when I saw it the rating was PG-13 (which made me seeing it all the more cooler, since I was  forbidden to see anything over PG at the time by my parents).  This is  actually a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark and starts with Indy being  tricked into drinking poison in Shanghai (while picking up the young Kate  Capshaw) then we're treated to an emergency crash landing in a lifeboat,  right in the heart of India, and a village that is in need of some serious  help, Indy style.  The village's sacred stone that kept it alive and  prosperous has been stolen as well as all of its children.  It's up to Indy  to save them, with the help of his young sidekick, Short Round (I have no  idea what the name means).  The violence in this one is a lot darker and  less comic than in Raiders, and a little bit scary for small children (I  know I was 8 when I first saw it remember).

Snake Surprise
Eyeball Soup

133403,4,0792157850,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is without question one of the most exhausting action films ever done.  Virtually all of its elaborate action sequences strive to top one another in power and spectacle, and they darn  near succeed in topping one another.
Therein, though, lies the film's  weakness.  It is much darker (thanks, of course, to exceptionally well done  photography) and more sadistic than the two Indy films that sandwich IJTOD.  By far the grossest scene comes when Mola Ram, the leader of the  literally-underground cult of Indian terrorists The Thugee, rips the heart  out of a sacrifice victim.
The film's extremely harrowing child slave  labor angle is also a double-edged sword; it is brutal even by Hollywood  standards (and in fact contributed to Steven Spielberg's later advocacy of  the PG13 rating), but it also provides greater effect in the film's  extremely long closing fight.
Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan shine as Indy  and ""his little bodyguard,"" Short Round.  Quan steals the show  almost from start to finish.  Getting in their way is the annoying Kate  Capshaw, a Hong Kong nightclub singer (she belts out Anything Goes in  Chinese at the start!) in the employ of Chinese gangsters.  Capshaw is a  horrible actress and manages to prove it with her whiney performance as  Willie Scott.
The film's action combines the bruising, vicious hand to  hand combat of First Blood with an exhilarating minecar rollercoaster  chase, a mountain waterfall, and a frightening collapse of a mountain  bridge, all scenes reminiscent of Superman The Movie.  Such scenes remain  among the wildest ever put to film.
The only major flaw as far as  production goes is the weak music of John Williams.  The music lacks the  edge that Jerry Goldsmith or Alan Silvestri often provide in their scores;  Temple Of Doom works better with Goldsmith's First Blood and Total Recall  scores than with Williams.

7791875,1,0792157850,"The worst sequel of the franchise, easily, as it was produced when both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were suffering through nasty divorces...their despair and depression practically bleeds onto the screen.

Kate Capshaw is a terrible actress by any measure, whining and bellowing and howling and shrieking her way through this film from beginning to end...why on earth Spielberg jumped out of one bad marriage and then hooked-up with Capshaw during the making of this movie is a profound mystery (except perhaps that he's into masochism).

Harrison Ford has never been worse in ANY film. This one is solid proof that Ford can't act unless a director is guiding his every breath and heartbeat; and, with director Spielberg running on only two cylinders, too much of Ford's sloppy work made it onto the screen.

The writing is abominable...but that's George Lucas for you.

I guess this movie's biggest problem is that the villains are not even identifiable to Western audiences. Seriously...a Thuggie Mystic Cult? Thuggies were the scourge of India for centuries, to be sure, but Western audiences can't relate.

The first film, ""Raiders,"" gave us Nazis vs Judaism, about as cut-and-dried as Evil vs Good gets in the 20th Century. The third film, ""Last Crusade,"" gave us Nazis vs Christianity, another easily-relatable Evil vs Good fable. The last film, ""Crystal Skull"" (probably second-worst of the franchise), tried using Communist Treachery as the enemy, which probably puzzled the Millennial Generation, since Millennials grew up indoctrinated under America's Socialist education system. So, Crystal Skull wasn't a blockbuster either.

Again, a successful Indiana Jones film needs a widely-accepted and unquestioned Evil vs Good premise. When the villains aren't clearly defined, an Indiana Jones story turns to mush.

Be assured, ""Temple of Doom"" is just such an unappetizing mush.",1522195200,,1890,5.364864864864865
