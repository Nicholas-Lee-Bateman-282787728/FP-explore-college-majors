7983970,5,B00008G96W,Giant of Thessaly is widely considered a classic Peplum and I agree this retelling of Jason and the Argonauts is entertaining. But the real gem here was Sins of Rome. This pre-Spartacus look at Spartacus has amazing production values. This example of early sword and sandal films can honestly be called a spectacle.,1514937600,,315,4.962264150943396
7983971,4,B00008G96W,"But good for a collection. Steve Reeves was a HOTTIE back in the day ladies!! Seeing him with his shirt off is good enough. In fact, ignore how old the movie is, and just turn the sound down and check out Steve with his shirt off. You can clearly see how HE is where Superman came from ...genetically speaking.",1238112000,,310,4.271186440677966
7983972,3,B00008G96W,"This DVD will take you back to an era in the 50s and 60s when Italian historical spectacles could be seen frequently at the local theatre. The huge success of the dubbed, but very colourful and lively film, ""Hercules"" with Steve Reeves, spawned numerous similar films with muscular heroes, scantily-clad heroines, nasty villains, swords, spears, chariots and so on.

What makes the double bill on this disc so interesting is that we have one film, ""Giants of Thessaly"", made in 1960, that clearly was intended to cash in on ""Hercules-mania"", and another film, ""Sins of Rome"", that preceded ""Hercules"" by at least five years.

In fact, I found ""Sins of Rome"" to be a much superior film. Directed by Riccardo Freda, ""Sins"" was made in 1952, and released in North America in 1954. Basically, ""Sins"" is the story of the rebel slave, Spartacus, later filmed as a wide-screen, big-budget spectacle with Kirk Douglas. ""Sins"" is full-screen and black and white, but it is still an impressive film, with a number of truly memorable scenes--the entry into Rome seems to literally have a cast of thousands. You will also not forget the gladiator scenes, with part of the arena flooded to accommodate a large warship, and other areas where lions are released, just to make things interesting for any unfortunate humans close by.

Hunky actor, Massimo Girotti is cast as Spartacus, a disgraced Thracian soldier, turned into a slave, and trained for the arena. Of course, he eventually breaks loose, raises an army and challenges Rome. There are some vigorous battles, and romantic interludes between Spartacus and the slave girl, Amitys ( lovely Ludmilla Tcherina ), and a scheming, unscrupulous Roman noblewoman, Sabina ( seductive Gianna Maria Canale ), who also lusts after our hero !

The black and white picture is acceptable, but not pristine.

On the whole, ""Sins"" is a fascinating relic, and surely influenced the more famous Spartacus film.

""Giants of Thessaly"" is quite a different type of movie, definitely aimed at the young crowd. Filmed in colour by--again--Riccardo Freda, and released in 1960, ""Giants"" is basically the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece. This famous Greek myth took up a good part of the plot for the Reeves ""Hercules"" movie, and was also filmed as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" in 1963 to showcase the special effect wizardry of stop-motion master, Ray Harryhausen. Of course, to compare ""Giants"" to the Harryhausen masterpiece is a joke.

To appease the ""wrath of Zeus"", King Jason and his men sail all over the place searching for the stolen Golden Fleece of legend.
In the mean time, Jason's nasty brother is scheming to take over the throne, full-time, not to mention Jason's long-suffering wife ! Jason is played by someone named ""Roland Carey""--tall, muscular, with the shaggy blond hair of a ""surfer dude""--think Owen Wilson--if he worked out for about 100 years !
As per usual in these films, Carey isn't much of an actor, but he sure can handle a sword ! In a supporting role as Orpheus, we have the star of ""Sins"", Massimo Girotti--his career as an actor must have been in decline !

Some sequences are pretty laughable today. Jason and Co. visit an island inhabited by beautiful women, only to discover these ""charmers"" are really witches who like to turn men into animals. When Jason finds some of his men are now sheep--and the sheep talk to him--it's hard to keep a straight face ! It's like a low-budget trailer for ""Babe"", with sheep instead of pigs ! Then there is a ""terrifying"" encounter with a giant cyclops--do not--I repeat--do not expect Ray Harryhausen's Cyclops from the "" 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" ! What we have here is more like an overgrown muppet ! I must admit the movie is still a lot of fun if you're in the right frame of mind, and the final battle is well done.

The colour in ""Giants"" is pretty fuzzy, but since this is the kind of film that is most appreciated after a few strong drinks, that shouldn't matter too much !

Bottom line--two Italian ""spear and sandal"" flicks that are quite different to one another, but each enjoyable in its own way. At this price, you certainly get your money's worth !",1094428800,32,4156,4.8
