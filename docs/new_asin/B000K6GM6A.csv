This is a really good deal if you like old movies.  Not every movie is a smash, but many are.  If you like old movies, read the product description.  If this sounds like you will like it, you will.

The mini-reviews on each disc jacket are helpful.

I also bought the Mystery Classics 100 Movie Pack.  I'm very pleased with both.

8154476,2,B000K6GM6A,"This collection is fair in content, considering most of them are movies taken from TV, and weekly TV movie format.  I was a little disappointed in quality, don't bother watching on blu-ray, any normal player is better for video playback.
  I also was thinking it would be more along the lines of Turner Classic movie collection, but I was wrong about that for sure.
  For the price, and for the content I gave 2 stars.  While you get a lot of movies, most of them are forgettable.  I say five of the collection are classic, no more.  However, if you consider you pay at least [...] bucks for most movies these days, there is value in this collection.
Overall...an average collection, but not for the classic movie buff.",1240617600,27,719,4.5625

8154479,3,B000K6GM6A,"With HOLLYWOOD CLASSICS 100 MOVIE PACK, MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT has neatly combined their ALL STAR and HOLLYWOOD LEGENDS 50 movie packs into one gigantic set. Half the collection is theatrical releases, while the rest consists of made-for-TV films from that genre's golden age, the 1960's to the '80s. With literally hundreds of top rank stars, this DVD box set will hold your interest for a long, long time.

The TV movies are surprisingly good. Some of the biggest stars appear here, in films that haven't been in primetime for over 20 years-- so they're certain to seem brand new. The HOLLYWOOD 100 MOVIE PACK is a perfect mix of celebrated, lesser known and totally forgotten (but still great) films, all at one super low price.
