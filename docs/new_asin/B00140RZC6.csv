8253834,4,B00140RZC6,"This is an interesting testimony, although it is not as convincing as it could have been.  It is a testimony, though, and not a debate.

That being said, the speaker shares in a warm and friendly way how he continued to find evidence in his doctoral studies that undermined the evolutionary view.  Prior to his doctoral studies, he had become a Christian and he had begun to question evolution.  When he began his doctoral program, he was concerned that he may have to shelve Christianity.  To his surprise, he found the opposite to be true.  His doctoral studies under professors fully committed to evolution led him to the conclusion that evolution was actually untenable and unsupported by the evidence.

So, this is pretty good as a testimony, but the the very best for comprehensive discussion of the issues.",1382659200,,813,4.8478260869565215
8253835,5,B00140RZC6,"A very enjoyable video for the whole family is ""From Evolution to Creation"" by Dr. Gary Parker. This video is Dr. Parker sharing his personal testimony of how he, as a former evolutionary scientist, came to embrace Creationism and ultimately become a born again Christian. He then begins to share some of the funny things that happened to him after he began lecturing as a Creation scientist. Along the way, he gives some of the fascinating scientific truths that verify the Bible's account of creation.

Dr. Gary's demeanor is very cute and warm, and you just cannot help but like this loveable guy when you listen to him! All our kids really enjoy watching this video, as he seems almost ""God-built"" for kids to enjoy. But because of his subject matter, adults love it too. So this video is truly one for the entire family to enjoy.

A few other great titles (DVD and/or book) regarding the evidence of special creation and/or scientific apologetics are:
