It feels even better the second time around.  The stories are good like I remember. The characters multi-dimensional and flawed like all of us. No syrupy endings. Just real stories. Season 2 continues the great work from Season 1 and it just continues into Season 3.  It's cool to see Matthew Fox as I remembered him before ""Lost"": incredibly good looking, charming, flawed, and brave, and Scott Wolf (cute, charming, and flawed like his big bro),  Jennifer Love Hewitt (I'd almost forgotten she was this young at one point). Same with Neve Campbell and the rest of the cast.",1392076800,,729,4.700787401574803

Its fun to see the young characters that I have now seen as adults on shows like General Hospital.
I love the old shows like this and Everwood and Providence and Ally McBeal. The shows were entertainment. Cant stand those dumb reality shows.

2431111,4,B000BNXD6O,This really is a good series. It just a little too much drama for me. All the ups and downs these kids have to go through to keep things together can wear on you a little. On the other hand my 19 year old daughter absolutely loves them.,1368748800,,236,3.9375

It's a good show about 5 siblings learning to live as a family after their parents died in a car collision with a drunk driver.

The theme of the show is that each of them become self center and selfish and with no parental guidance, they do what they want but one way or another, their actions affect the rest of the family. Slowly they learn this and become closer as the season go on.

In season 2 the family experience again all the human emotions. From the joy of charlies wedding, to julias unwantet pregnancy, nearly loosing the restaurant, to finally finding a long lost family member.

I can't wait for season 3 to be releases!",1162771200,2,503,4.640449438202247
2431143,3,B000BNXD6O,"Let me start by saying that I was a huge fan of Party of Five when it originally aired, and I still am a huge fan.  I have seasons 1 & 2 on DVD and will most likely buy season 3 if it is released.  It's a GREAT show. I would say it's in my top 3 television shows of all time.

Serious fans from when it was originally broadcast will know that the careful selection of wonderful music was something that took an already great show to another level. I became familiar with quite a few excellent musicians via the show, including Nanci Griffith, Chris Isaak & Vonda Shepard (this was before she was a regular on Ally McBeal).

Two of the most memorable scenes for me that have music changes are when Julia meets up with Griffin at the coffee shop early in season 2 (I think it was in Dearly Beloved) the song originally aired was Somebody's Crying by Chris Isaak.  The second and more unforgiveable change for me was during the surprise ending of the final episode of season 2.  I don't want to give anything away, but the song that is supposed to play is Solsbury Hill by Peter Gabriel.  It was just perfect with that scene.  If you are seeing Party of Five for the first time via this DVD set, you are really missing out.

I read the reviews here when season 2 was released, and perhaps that is why I did not buy it right away - there is one earlier review that warns about music changes. When I finally decided to buy season 2 I did not remember the warning.  I probably would have eventually bought the set, but it would have been less of a shock to see the altered version.

A couple of smaller complaints... There were a few scenes with Carroll O'Connor and Lacey Chabert (Claudia) - I don't remember the exact episode - when the shots from one of the cameras was pretty grainy.  It was very noticeable when they switched between cameras.  Seems like they could have remastered that.  The other complaint is the menu listing episodes.  It would have been nice to have a list of all the episodes for a disc on the same screen, and easier navigation between episodes.  It was a bit cumbersome to me.

I would still recommend the show, and I hope that subsequent seasons are released.

If anyone's listening who has control over these things - I would be willing to buy a new version of season 2 if they re-released it with the original music, even though I already have season 2 on DVD.  At least put a notice on the current version that the episodes are not as originally aired.",1161648000,10,2480,4.317494600431965

2431148,5,B000BNXD6O,"I'm not your typical tv or dvd fan. I don't watch a lot of tv, and I don't own alot of dvds. The only shows in the last decade that I've LOVED have been those of Joss Whedon, Seinfeld and the first season of Roswell. With the exception of Seinfeld, the other shows all had a few elements in common: They were fantasy shows about people (often teenagers/people in their 20s) whose fantastical stories were used to tell stories about what life is really like, using metaphor. That made all those shows (including the first season of Roswell) very layered, very rich and very real. At their heights, Buffy and Angel in particular were the best dramas on tv (just as Seinfeld was the greatest comedy of the 90s) and I watch the dvds for those shows over and over, years after they went off the air.

But before those shows were on however, Party of Five was the same type of show, quality-wise. Of course, it is completely the opposite, being completely realistic, often devastatingly so. There's no fantasy, no special effects, no gimicks of most of the popular dramas on tv (cops, lawyers, doctors or spies). It's just stark real-life, driven by dialogue, with touches of humor, romance and a very tighly-knit family of five syblings and their loved ones (mainly romantic interests of the main four characters). But this show did more, especially in its second season, than any other drama on network tv at the time.

I'll go so far as to say that Before and After in particular deserved an emmy for best writing and dramatic series for 1995-6, at a minimum. This was the show that in its time went further than any us tv show in dealing with the issue of abortion (in nearly all its personal dimensions) than any other since Maude in 1972! Keep in mind it would be another 13 years until Everwood finally had the courage to allow a character to have an abortion on network tv last year, something I still find stunning. Neve Campbell, Michael Goorjian and the rest of the cast simply blow everything else on tv from that time out of the water.

The earlier plot arc leading up to Charlie's wedding, the episode itself of the same name and the episode that follows have similar dramatic punch. Charlies not wanting to live his father's life in perpetuity from when he's 25 is a completely understandable thing. But its impact on Kirsten (not to mention his siblings), the full effects of which wouldn't be seen for years and her reaction are also completely understandable. And the effects of his continued cavalier attitude to women later in the year culminate in his nearly losing everything for the family.

A side note, the interaction between Justin/Griffin and Julia ia also captivating. Clearly Campbell's character has impeccable taste in boyfriends (I wish I was as much of a man as each of them are), but Julia obviously doesn't know what she wants and is driven to her wits end by the abortion/miscarriage discussed above.

As as guy I guess the reasons I watch this show are foremost for Campbell and Hewitt. And they are both essentially fabulous. The first time I saw Hewitt when the show was still on, besides her beauty and charisma (not to mention how sweet the character is, especially in later seasons), I was captivated by how her eyes moved. I had never seen someone as star-crossed as her. I don't see it the same way now and I can see why those who dislike Hewitt for her shifty eyes and say she mainly acts with them have a point. But she is still an excellent actress and demonstrates it both with her interaction with Scott Wolf and in her adoption story line. I HATED it when she was booted off the show and it was somewhat pathetic what happened to her spinoff, not to mention how she wasn't brought back for the series finale. But here in season 2 you get the first of four years where we are graced with her presence in the role that really started her career.

Wolf and Fox are also excellent, as usually is Chabert. One criticism I have of her in this season is her tendency to occasionally overact. It's as though she has possibly the greatest potential of anyone in the cast, but whether because of poor direction, her youth or whatever she too often melodramatic. But I would say that's exceptional, because most of the time she is a dynamo of energy who only improves in later seasons.

Again to mention the minor players from this season, Paula Devicq is fantastic as Kirsten, Both Goojian and Griffin are likewise, while Scott Grimes also bring alot to the show. Brenda Strong is excellent, sweet, strong and beautiful as Charlie's girlfriend Kathleen. And of course Carroll O'Connor may have been the show's greatest casting coup of its 6 run. There isn't much more you can say about him.

A quick criticism of the dvd. The 2nd season yes has very few features, which is a shame. Devicq, Keyser and Wolf (especially the men) seem to dominate the commentaries (of which 3 is FAR too few for this, one of P of 5's best seasons). The JLH interview is alot better than others have said, though I don't know what is up with her hair now. There should definitely have been alot more features. As to the music being changed as other reviewers have said, I honestly can't tell since it's been a decade since I saw this season on the air. But there do seem to be many spots where music is clearly a key narrative device where the music doesn't fit well enough, which leads me to believe the other reviewers are right.

All in all, this show is not a Joss Whedon show, Seinfeld or the Simpsons in the level of quality (with some notable episode exceptions). But being a half step or step down from that is still a VERY high standard and is probably better than ANYTHING on network tv today. P of 5 was in many ways way ahead of its time and the second season definitely belongs in your dvd collection if you value quality drama. Let's hope sony gives enough of a damn to its consumers and this fantastic show's important legacy to release seasons 3-6 in the near future.",1144886400,3,5997,4.5402405180388525

2431155,5,B000BNXD6O,"I was really afraid that the second season of this beautiful show was never going to be released, but I am very glad they have decided to go ahead with it. Apparently this is the public's last chance to get out and buy the two boxed sets that are already out and give the company a valid reason to start working on the last four season sets. I am not sure whether or not that will happen, but with a show this good I sincerely hope that it is immortalized through the release of every single season.

The difficulty the studio has had getting these DVD's out is almost frighteningly similar to the plight the show experienced when it was running on the air in the mid-90's. Nobody knew if they liked it; perhaps they weren't really sure what to even think of it. Perhaps this is because of the incredibly thick layer of drama woven into the show--many fans have liked it and respected it for taking that leap of faith, but for others it might just be too much. One thing about Party of Five that nobody can deny--it is not the least bit scared to lay it thick with the drama. I am serious; I have never seen any other contemporary television show function--and SUCCEED--by depicting young characters with these many problems, poor decision making, and struggles to stay above water. Every single episode is literally just packed with one incredibly dramatic issue after another.

For those who may not know, the basic premise of this show follows the plight of five siblings ranging from ages 2 to mid-20's. These kids have lost their parents in a car crash, have somehow managed to stay together, and are now trying to establish a whole new family dynamic for themselves. Well, Season 1 was more of an indication of that given theme; the siblings were closer and banded together more back then. By Season 2, there was a considerable amount of independence coming from each of them, and while they remained a family they branched out a bit more, finding preoccupation with their own lives and personal situations. This was probably one of the best seasons in the series, because the Salinger clan was still young and their issues didn't yet become completely out of control. ""The Wedding,"" which portrays Kirsten and Charlie's nightmarish wedding day, is a standout episode in the season and even the entire series, and that episode alone is worth the purchase of the whole season set.

Party of Five is hardly a light and warm show that depicts how these kids band together and have a super-close, fuzzy relationship. It's far from that. If you get into this show, you're going to start witnessing five very different people with problems all their own. This season finds 25-year-old Charlie, a nice guy doing what he can to meet the needs of his younger siblings but fearing that his whole life has already been mapped out and struggles mercilessly with commitment (and if you think he's bad here, wait until you see him in later seasons). High school senior Bailey is trying hard to bail his big brother out and take care of everything, but at the same time he is fighting desperately for any and every moment of fun and independence he can gain for himself. 17-year-old Julia continues to battle with her partying ways and falls prey to some worse-case scenario teen pressures without a mother around to guide her. 12-year-old Claudia wants and deserves a family to take care of her but is discovering every day, more and more, that her siblings have their own affairs and that she is basically fending for herself. Then there's toddler Owen, who is...well, he's a toddler being raised by his older siblings instead of a mother and father. Enough said. (And quite honestly, with everything going on with the four older Salinger kids, it's fascinating that this baby is being taken care of at all. But that is a separate story.)

One episode of this show is likely to leave you feeling emotionally drained. You want to see these kids do well and be OK with all the tragedy and societal pressures they have had to encounter, but in classic Party of Five tradition, what you actually get is a raw and relatively true-to-life account on what happens when five young, immature kids are left to be on their own without parents. No, they don't just hug and hold each other and live a sticky sweet life with one another; they experience those typical youth struggles every single day, with a newfound independence that sounds good but often leaves them with a life that that they aren't necessarily mature enough to handle just yet.

This is not to say, in any way, that the show is horrible and that it doesn't display any good family emotions. Yes, these siblings love one another and when the chips are down they are always going to be there for each other, but the road Party of Five goes down indicates the trials that kids go through and the trouble they tend to fall into when Mom and Dad aren't around to take care of them and keep them in shape. They have all this freedom and don't seem to be quite sure how to best deal with it, so they basically end up doing whatever they want (with frightening results most of the time). It's a gutsy, gutsy show; there's no denying that. Your heart reaches out to all five of them, which is a tribute to the nice acting given by Matthew Fox, Scott Wolf, Neve Campbell, and Lacey Chabert.

As these characters grow, develop, and change over the years, ther is always at least one of them with whom you can truly identify, and sometimes that changes as you yourself grow and find yourself experiencing some of the same things that they are. For me, I was especially touched by the performance of Lacey Chabert as youngest sister Claudia. It is really very heartbreaking to watch this 12-year-old kid be blatantly ignored by her older siblings, who love her but don't really have much time for her with everything that's going on in their personal lives. You really feel for her as she learns that she's pretty much on her own in stepping headfirst into the scary world of adolescence. She is, in many ways, the conscience of the show, with some impressive lines that leave you both surprised and cheering on that beyond-her-years wisdom.

For the most part, the development of the five Salinger kids was very well done and an incredibly realistic portrayal, given the circumstances surrounding the plot. The only character that really annoys me on a consistent basis is Julia, who always seems to just be doing the most random stupid things, even for a misguided teenage girl, and I don't see as much realism in her character as with the rest of the kids. However, there are plenty of good things for all 5 of them, and in general it works just fine.

All in all, it is a very emotionally charged and powerful show that may raise a lot of questions and present a lot of controversial and taboo issues (e.g. teen pregnancy, abortion, underage drinking, unfaithfulness in relationships), but in short you'll be getting something empowering that isn't afraid to grapple with the less sunshine-y side of life.

Unfortunately, I have a bad feeling that the remaining 4 seasons will not be released on DVD anytime soon, and possibly not even at all. It is truly a shame that this series has not done as well in DVD sales, for whatever reason. Part of the reason may be because the rights to the original music have not been permitted and they had to change it for the first 2 DVD seasons. In any case, it seems like it's going to take a miracle for the whole series to come out, but I guess we can only just keep hoping!",1138320000,3,7556,4.595255744996294
2431156,3,B000BNXD6O,"2nd season is my favourite of this excellent show. I just wanted to warn the real fans that they may be very disappointed to see that the soundtrack has be changed. In several episodes that I love and that I almost know by heart for having recorded them on videotapes, the songs have been changed, and I tell you that it makes all the difference, as I think the soundtrack of this show has a very important part in the reasons why this show is so special and different from the other ones. So, yes buy it because if not Sony pictures will not product the other seasons on dvds, but like me protest against the change of the soundtrack, hoping that they will not do the same thing with the other seasons. This is the reason why I only give a 3 stars rate to these DVDs, instead of a 5 stars rate to this excellent show.",1137628800,4,818,4.1835443037974684

2431159,5,B000BNXD6O,"2 whole years after the release of the first series of this classic show, we finally get Season 2! And it wasn't going to be released, so we have to thank the success of `Lost', which of course also stars Matthew Fox.

This show is an emotional journey, from start to finish.  It very maturely handles tough topics that most teenagers will come across at some stage (hopefully not all of the problems!), without preaching and is handled realistically and without being too cheesy; breakdown of marriages, death, muggings, lesbianism, adoption, jealousy, teenage rebellion, truancy, family problems and so many more important subjects.  This isn't just a teen show though, the script is very maturely written, and all the characters are likeable and you feel for their pain. (To be honest, there isn't an episode that I watch that doesn't get me teary eyed at some point).  All the performances are excellent, and I recommend this show to any parents who want their teens to watch a positive show with a message.

Let's hope the distributor has a bit more respect for those who have bought the series and are waiting for Season 3!",1136937600,5,1129,4.798969072164948

The storylines are great and the pain of the ill-fated relationship between Charlie and Kirsten is one that I can relate to. Don't let anyone make you feel cheesy for watching this show! It's definitely WAY better than the crap that's on Fox or any TV station these days. (i.e. ""Stacked"" with Pamela Anderson, etc.)

It takes almost 10 years for me to recap some of the wonderful plots (mainly the story line between Bailey and Sarah) of the show. My only complaint is that its special features (just cast commentaries for 3 of the episodes and a half hour interview with Sarah) are a bit less when compared with those of season 1. Nevertheless, I believe every fans of the show will be more than delighted to receive the product.

By the way, I'm a bit surprised that Jennifer Love Hewitt can do all the senseful talking in the special feature for half an hour withour boring the audience. She's really a gifted person.",1135728000,3,702,4.4

By far, Party of Five stands tall above the rest especially when the 5th season of Seinfeld has already been released.  For the love of God, please don't take half as long to release season 3. You gotta love the way the Salingers' handled everyday trials and triumphs without parental involvement.  Simply the best and one of my all time favorites!!!!",1133136000,4,516,4.410526315789474

I am in total agreement that all of these seasons come out on DVD so I can Cancel all my depressing non-entertaining trailer-park reality TV show excrement cable channels once and for all.  This show was one of the last doses of inspiration from writers as it appears the producers have lost all originality and foresight as to what a decent show is and are only interested in profit, propaganda, and advertisement of regurgitated mainstream sheeplevision.

It is a critically-acclaimed series that I remember was on Wednesday nights at 9PM after Beverly Hills 90210 at 8PM on Fox Channel 11 in Los Angeles area.  Season 2 aired during

September 27, 1995 to March 1996.  It continues story about Orphans growing up after losing their parents in a car accident.  The Five members of the family grow up and experience life together.  It is a great series with good story lines.

It won Best Drama Series at the Golden Globe Awards in January 1996.  It beat out formidable competition such ass ER, NYPD Blue, and Chicago Hope.  ER has release 3 seasons of DVD and the ER 4th season is coming Dec 20, 2005, NYPD blue has 2 seasons out so far.  Facts according to the book: The Unofficial Companion for Seasons 1 to 3 by Brenda Scott Royce and is a good source of extra information on the series.  Check used books on Amazon for this title.

Party of Five's Characters are Matthew Fox who plays Charlie Salinger and Jennifer Love Hewitt who plays Bailey's (Scott Wolf) girlfriend Sarah Reeves.  Bo Deans' ""Closer to Free"" is one of the opening theme song during the second season.  Music from the Party of Five 1994 -TV series is available used at Amazon.

Second Season introduces Sarah Reeves, old friend of Julia (Neve Campbell), who spent working  at the Salingers Restaurant and nursing a crush on Bailey.  Justin Julia's Boyfriend is introduced.  It focuses more on the Character's relationships during the second season.

Matthew Fox is now on the hit show LOST on ABC Wednesdays as Jack the physician and the leader of the group on the passenger that are lost on an island.  Lost is now in its 2nd Season and very popular.  He was Charlie, the leader and oldest sibling on Party of Five.

Jennifer Love Hewitt plays a Medium Melinda Gorodon along with paramedic Jim on Ghost Whisperer and airs Fridays at 8pm on CBS.  She was very popular Sarah Reeves on Party of Five and the movie series I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER AND I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and recent project on Garfield the movie.

I would like to see some DVD commentary from Matthew Fox and Jennifer Love Hewitt in this second season of Party of Five and any extras.  These two characters Matthew Fox and Jennifer Love Hewitt are really popular on these TV shows so they should release Party of Five because of other good shows have been released like My So Called Life and Once and Again.  Good stories and good characters make a hit TV show like Party of Five.

Fans of Party of Five, please buy the series so we can see the rest of the Seasons of Party of Five and we can watch episodes that we missed and uncut with no commercials.  If you like Beverly Hills 90210, LOST, Ghost Whisperer, and Once and Again, you will like Party of Five.",1129334400,7,2935,4.4849056603773585

The script writing is beautiful and the actors are brilliant. I shared every emotion with the characters and truely felt part of the Salinger family. I loved the show so much that I named my son after my favourite character - Bailey. I purchased the first season early 2004 and have been waiting for the second season.

I love every single episode.  Will buy every season they put out...I beg to have all.  I was in my early 20s when this show first aired.

My 15 yr old son has watched 1 & 2 with me. Some of the life lessons learned on this show are irreplaceable.  Things too difficult to talk to teachers or parents about.

I was almost 30 when I watched this series when it originally aired. I'm sure in most every episode, I was taken from laughter to tears and back again. At this point this series seems to have only a cult following and that is a shame because we may never see the 3rd season for that reason. If everyone had a little more insight into the greatness of this series they would buy it. Remember the second season was originally supposed to be released to dvd back on November 16th 2004, but sales of season 1 didn't meet expectations and was postponed (almost permanently).  ....Buy the second season. .....Buy the second season. .....
