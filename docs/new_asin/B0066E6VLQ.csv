Mary discovers in a restaurant her identical twin. Because her twin is wealthy, her companions decide to rob her mansion when shes out using Mary as a substitute decoy. This is a simple story heaped in suspense concerning Mary being discovered. Loretta Young plays dual roles in this film. She is fascinating to watch, and doubly fascinating when she plays twins. Youll enjoy this lightweight but thoroughly engaging film.

Week-End Marriage
Kens reluctant to marry Lola because he doesnt make enough to support her properly, but Lola connives him into marriage and makes him promise to let her work to help out. Turns out shes much more successful than he, and that creates a serious conflict. Loretta Young is beautiful and an accomplished actress. If she stars, the movie is well worth watching. This film is a fascinating look at the conflict women of the time face between being independent or taking the role of devoted wife and mother confined to the home. The end of the film may be a moral for the times, but will disappoint modern sensibilities. This movie is an enjoyable viewing experience, and I consider it must see viewing.",1496534400,,1155,4.862944162436548

8493941,2,B0066E6VLQ,"Loretta Young began her long career as a teenager in silents.  She made the transition to talkies seamlessly and had a busy contract at Warner Brothers until mid 1933 when she left and joined Daryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century pictures.  During that time, Young learnt her trade and if she was not a technically adept actress, she certainly was a natural.  Many of her performances from this era are sensitive, simple and charming even when the circumstances in which she found herself were not.

In this DVD double issued by the Warners Archives, we get 2 titles which probably would never have seen the light of day otherwise. The first is ""Road to Paradise"", released in 1930. This is an early talkie melodrama about twin sisters, seperated in childhood; one has wealth and social position, the other is the ward of 2 crooks.  The plot is fruity melodrama, full of improbabilities and holes and it makes for dreary viewing. Young is luminous. Her diction is straight from finishing school and her dual performance is non existent but she was only 17 at the time; still, she is really the only reason to view the film. A plus is that the director has varied the camera angles adding some vitality to what really seems a filmed stage production.

By 1932, when ""Weekend Marriage"" was made, Young had made many melodramas, often playing working girls trying out for successful careers, and in that sense, some of her films of this period seem to blur in the memory. In this one, she tries to reconcile marriage with career. This film suffers from a common problem with the script - starts well and ends badly. It sets up Loretta's problems carefully as she is urged into marriage by her future sister in law, the practical and funny Aline MacMahon. Then it descends into a series of contrived plot devices finishing with a dreadful denouement which would appal any feminist (or anyone at all, for that matter). Along the way, a touch of realism is notable when Loretta tries to provide moral support to an office pal who is being coerced into a marriage by her father. This scene is the best in the movie and quite shocking in its implications. This is pre-code too, and there is one excellent moment when Loretta and her husband wake up in their double bed and he is aroused but she replies she can't be late for work two days in a row! The cast are competent, Loretta is sexy and natural in the best sense but the plot ultimately falls apart leaving a sour taste.

The prints of both films are very good but the Warner's Archive sets are expensive, contain no extras and are made ""on demand"" so don't expect them to last forever.",1344297600,4,2628,4.590618336886994
