3120366,4,B0013XZ756,"A. Susan and Gary Svehla's 2nd film effort, Terror in the Pharaoh's Tomb, is a film you could use cliches about because they are GOOD cliches. It truly is a lighthearted romp, with old-style banter and a throwback black and white look that works. Anyone who loved Povety Row, Republic Serials, or Saturday matinee films from childhood (which even THEN were knockoffs and homages to other films) should enjoy this movie. Throw pretention out the window. It's been said and bears repeating, this is a group endeavor, although cunningly dreamt-up, written and directed by Susan Svehla, made by people who love movies, FOR people who love certain kinds of older movies and the conventions those movies employed. That's why it's an homage as well as a bit campy. It's also a very family-friendly movie, with just a touch of PG thrown in with some of the lines and pretty women, to keep the adults happy. While the main actors are fine in their parts, the supporting and character actors steal the show, and many shine. The project is ambitious, and a testament to a lot of long hours of repeated takes and camera angles, as in any movie, as well as meticulous and thoughtful editing and a careful addition of music and spliced-in cuts. All was conjured up by film lovers, professionals including camera men, make-up women, and real dancers, among others, and people who believe in Sue's vision of making plain old FUN movies with a bit of action, adventure, romance, humor and mystery all mixed together.
The blooper real shows the vibrant color that was used in costuming--but for this film, with the intercuts of old stars and footage, the scratchy black and white worked better. TITPT takes their first film, Terror in the Tropics, and ups the ante quite successfully. Kudos to Sue, Gary and the entire cast and crew for their sense of fun, their literal sweat and hard work, and for just giving us a real popcorn movie (with real popcorn necessary, not that air-popped stuff with no butter, salt or oil).

3120369,1,B0013XZ756,"Many years ago, I enjoyed reading a horror magazine called Midnight Marquee. Tne editors were Gary and A Susan Svehla. The Magazine was a tribute to classic horror films of the 30's, 40's ,50's & sometimes 60's

Their first film entertainment film Terror in The Phantom's Tomb is more of a joke than a tribute to the classic horror. A. Susan Svehla, who wrote and directed this film, stole lineS  from MANY classic horror films and even from Star Wars. The mummy film also had intercuting oldtime screen actors (using public domain footage) into scenes with modern day actors... it makes this so called homage  a very weak effort, similar to Dead Men Wear Plaid.

Svehla filmed her actors mainly on a blue screen, so the backgrounds were CGI and added later...similar what they did in Spy Kids 3.  One would wish this film was as good as Spy Kids 3. It is a nice effort to use CGI if the film was worthy of it, but it isn't! Svahla tried to  make  this 2007 release seem like an old time mummy classic horror  film of old...it does  not work other than a campy effort. There is old film bubbles and streaks to make this modern film seem old hat after awhile...it just makes this film worse. It made this film seem like a SF Convention joke, rather than a tribute film

 Calling her Baltimore troupe actors in this film is a joke. Most of  these people overact  so badly that you bore quickly. The makeup for the Mummy seems like a plaster of paris mask gone bad. The costume seems like Goodwill or EBAY specials. This film seem like a homemade horror movie, rather than a proffession effort

I love old horror movies,but this homage is NOT a tribute..it is so campy that only film fans would get it.

Svehla and her friends do audio commentary with pop up bubbles for those interested in film facts...it works if you want to know where she stole (those are her words NOT MINE from the commentary) what quote or where it was filmed....but there is no real insight into this film at all

Look if I wanted Citzen Kane, I'd buy it. I am not a film snob and I love old horror films. I do understand this production is a homemade film, made for a smaller audience. What bothers me is the idea is the hype of a small film with great production value...it should have been better! If that is mean spirited or makes others uncomfortable...right or wrong, I have done my job as a critic correctly.

Is this film worth a good look? If you are a classic horror film fan and need a good laugh, you may enjoy it. However for the rest of us...NOT AT ALL  is the best answer

I welcome your comments after you seen this movie. Agree or Disagree, this film is pure campy horror

8253408,1,B0013XZ756,"In my opinion Terror of the Phantoms Tomb should be taken off Amazon. Story and actors(?) way worse than Plan 9. False produce and advertising is the real problem here. All big name stars had absolutely nothing to do with the the production of this ""RIP""off. a couple 10 second clips of George Zucco, Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, etc. have been edited in and may or may not make any sense to the sad story going on.
Do yourself a huge fave and pass on this even if found in the .99 cent bargain bin.

This movie is pretty impressive,First there is a real story to go with found footage of some our classic scary-actors,the editing of the two cinematic worlds is pretty seamless and the leads are most welcome with credible turns at scenery chewing.

Quibbling comes in when you realize this is definitely made for safe audiences,Slight violence and queen shows a wee bit of skin,But that is all.

Big fan of the current leads Leanna Chamish (from the Loanna Lee series ) is very mean as a queen,George Stover ( Maryland film community Icon) plays muliple roles and is so convincing and Nicolai Volkoff ( WWE wrestler)plays well an Impressive Russian character.",1402963200,,850,5.274074074074074

This was absolutely abysmal and also a scam. The movie was so rotten, I threw away the disc and only saw 1/3rd of it. Novices on U-Tube could do a better job! Lon Chaney, George Zucco and others are used as a come along. This is unethical. The movie is soap opera formatted, then old reels are thrown in, such as scenes from actual movies the above stars were in. Slapped together garbage. This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen out of thousands of movies. I couldn't be more disappointed. Anyone who sells this movie knowing its worthlessness is unethical.
