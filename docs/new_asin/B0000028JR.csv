7902155,5,B0000028JR,"The Sesame Street ""Getting Ready For School"" video is one of the most educational in the series. Many children are intimidated by their first day, but Big Birg and Snuffy make sure that you feel comfortable. By  singing great songs (like ""Raise Your Hand"", ""Children In  Our Class"", and ""Tying Your Shoelace"") this video makes  learning fun! I first watched the video about 12 years ago, and its still  one of my favorite videos.",954115200,7,429,4.756756756756757
