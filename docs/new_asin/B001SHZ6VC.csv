8339869,1,B001SHZ6VC,"I have this movie (The Sea Wolves) on DVD; its a good movie.  I would give it at least four stars.  When I received the BLU-ray, I was really glad to get an improved copy, but it was not The Sea Wolves.  The disc had the right packaging, but the movie was 1961s Splendor In The Grass with Natalie Wood.  I would guess the whole production run is like this.",1508976000,,356,4.042857142857143

A German submarine launches a torpedo against a British ship. How did they know its location? In Calcutta Englishmen gather in a building to listen to a radio. What does the SOE do? Special Operations. The Calcutta Light Horse wants to help the war effort. They located a powerful transmitter in Portuguese Goa, a neutral land. Can they pick up information on interned German ships? Two men visit Goa and talk to the owner of a caf. There is gambling on the top floor, roulette. Does Manuel know anything about a German and an Indian? Mrs. Cromwell visits Manuel. Those two men follow a man to Caf Lisbon. He is lured inside and given orders. Another man arrives, he is recognized as a German agent. Mrs. Cromwell arrives. At night two assassins try to kill Lewis but fail. David visits Mrs. Cromwell. An unexpected visitor pays for his bad manners.

Trompheta is taken for a ride, he resists. A bad career move! They return to India. Trompheta was replaced. Lewis has a plan to neutralize that transmitter. They ask for volunteers. No recognition. Germans exercise on the beach, one receives news. [Were you surprised? I suspected it.] The Light Horse acquire an old rust bucket for their mission. Supplies are loaded and it leaves port. [Note that narrow gauge railroad.] Their ship spots something in the water. Gavin uses influence to distract the officers and crew of those three German ships. Lewis talks to the volunteers. Another man has a scheme to attract sailors on a weekend. Gavin meets Mrs. Cromwell in private. Later she visits Gavins room. Will she be found? The volunteers are told of their mission. There is a problem with that old ship engine, but it is fixed.

Mrs. Cromwell invites Gavin to a meeting. Come alone. Can the Phoebe make up the lost time? The volunteers get training in arms and using those magnetic mines (to be placed below the waterline). Gavin Stewart arrives at the reception. One man is surprised! Gavin explains his delay to Mrs. Cromwell, they meet in private for a discussion. There is a celebration in the streets of Goa. Fireworks explode in the sky. The volunteers get their final instructions and they approach their first target. They board the ship in silence. Doors are unlocked, the radio is destroyed, code books are captured. Then they prepare to leave. But there are casualties. Push off! There is a problem with that old engine, but it starts. Poor devils. The damaged German ships sink. After this Light Horse raid in March 1943 only one Allied ship was lost.

This is an interesting movie based on a true event, Boarding Party by James Leasor. It combined both an intelligence operation and an action movie. How was that information obtained? Loose lips sink ships? The leak needed to be plugged. The SOE was negligent in not investigating that friendly widow. Beware of friendly strangers is still good advice. This story was changed from the book for added drama.",1429488000,,2976,4.772815533980583
