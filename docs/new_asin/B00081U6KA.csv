2256940,1,B00081U6KA,"This show is only for the mentally, socially, and maturity bankrupt. All the worst characteristics and stereotypes about men, glorified and amplified to point of near parody. The joke is, it's completely serious. A sad, sad excuse for entertainment, and on behalf of men everywhere, I'm sorry it exists.",1290816000,4,303,5.204081632653061
2256941,5,B00081U6KA,"I have had this on my christmas / birthday / father's day / etc list forever.  When I realized that waiting for someone else to buy me the MAN SHOW was a waste of time, I grabbed my sack and put down the money for one of the funniest shows on TV.  Don't bother with anything past season 1 & 2.  What can I say?  Jimmy and Adam will NEVER apologize for being a MAN; the Fox is the most incredible beer drinking machine I have ever seen and any show that ends up with girls on trampolines is the best thing since...well, anything.

I really miss these guys and while they are not doing too badly, nothing they will do will ever top the first two seasons of the MAN SHOW.",1277424000,12,668,4.03030303030303
2256942,5,B00081U6KA,"Ahh, the man show!  I was crestfallen to turn to this page and see so few reviews written!  Only two reviews?  Come on Adam Carolla fans, let's get busy!  Okay, I'll do my review on it to pump up the numbers.

This show is incredibly funny and a perfect man's best friend DVD set.  This is like the DVD version of Maxim or FHM, or any other magazine like that.  It truly is a masterpiece in DVD porn for men, except there's no porn in it.  Just lots and lots of juicy, jiggling women jumping up and down.  Watching this, makes you understand the difference between a normal women, and a sex pot; the difference between a tom boy and a flesh pot of lovely femininity.  It truly is wonderful watching all the jokes and sight gags.

I love the ""Adult Star"" household tips.  I also loved a sequence when Jimmy and Adam went to Venice Beach to educate people on the emancipation of women voters.  I think they were saying it was helping women, and somebody came up to explain it was hurting women.  Hilarious!

Awesome show!!!",1225843200,7,1021,4.3563829787234045
2256943,5,B00081U6KA,"Hey, it's the Man Show, what more could you want?!  The episodes with Adam & Jimmy are always good.  Love those Juggies!  (Especially Juggie Vanessa!)",1169510400,3,150,4.92
2256944,4,B00081U6KA,"Comedy Central examines the mind of the common man in the outrageous comedy series ""The Man Show"". Hosts Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel offer a unique male perspective on important topics that men care about like sports, porn, nagging wives, beer and women jumping on trampolines. Carolla and Kimmel expose the truth on many important male issues and drive political correctness out the door. ""The Man Show"" is a hilarious half hour skit-based comedy series that explores the best and worst traits of men. Hosts Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel are hilarious and have good comic chemistry. The comedy series also stars the buxom Juggy Dance Squad and the beer-guzzling emcee Bill ""The Fox"" Foster who passed away after the first season. Some of the show's recurring sketches include ""Man-Ovations"", ""Movies Men Don't Want to See"" and ""Household Hints from Adult Film Stars"". With its brand of sophomoric humor and eye-catching dancers, ""The Man Show"" had a good run on Comedy Central but by the fifth season, the comedy series fell apart and was shortly cancelled with the new hosts.

If you like watching two guys acting like complete idiots and hot girls jumping around on trampolines, then ""The Man Show: The Complete First Season"" is certainly a worthy purchase. All 22 episodes are presented in its original full screen format. The picture quality and 2.0 Dolby Digital sound aren't overwhelming but still rather pleasant. Among special features, both volumes include some never-before-seen comic sketches and extended montages of girls bouncing around on trampolines. Overall, ""The Man Show: The Complete First Season"" gets a ""B"".",1165276800,16,1632,5.158490566037736

2256953,5,B00081U6KA,"Good quality, complete season, great special features. I highly recommend to anyone that finds the most offensive ideas out there to be Politically Correct ideas.",1357948800,3,162,5.52
2256954,5,B00081U6KA,"If you're not bright enough to entertain a funny premise without necessarily agreeing with it, you should not have a computer, let alone have access to a show as funny as this.  Adam and Jimmy were consistently creative and funny, and their efforts to make us laugh by embracing all that is boorish about us men were much appreciated by me, especially as the politically correct nonsense was taking hold.  This show was, of course, partially a pushing back at the ridiculousness of that sensibility. Sophomoric and crude?  Sure!  Funny as hell?  Absolutely.

I'd imagine that the people who don't get it also don't get Howard Stern...those of us in on it can see when he's just pushing the envelope to be entertaining or provocative.  Yes, people, sometimes it's just entertainment.

Adam and Jimmy are phenomenal talents with chemistry that cannot be manufactured.  You'll see that if you watch the seasons after they left.  Treat yourself and get the seasons that Adam and Jimmy hosted.

Five stars, suckas!",1355961600,3,1009,4.946428571428571
