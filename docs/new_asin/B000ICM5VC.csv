2655329,5,B000ICM5VC,"When I saw ""Dr. No"" the first of the James Bond's movies in my youth, I became instantly infatuated and a fan of this Ian Fleming's Character  Spy; as well as an avid admirer of Albert R. Broccoli's rendition of this 007 'Film Personality' in all it's subsequent Film productions. A tradition followed up to this day by his Heirs. ~~~ OH! By the way FYI, for those of you that are not aware, PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT: ~ The James Bond's movie ""YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE"" though it was the last time that Sean Connery played 007, as awesome as ever! this was a Film Produced by another company. Therefore, it was not an ""A. F. Broccoli Production."" So please do not expect to find it on either one of this Four Volumes of ""JAMES BOND ULTIMATE EDITION.""

Now back to my review, since I owe everyone of the Twenty one James Bond Films on DVD & VHS, I was a bit hesitant to spend a few hundred dollars to up-date films already on my 'DVD Library.' WELL TRUST ME, that the money would be very well spend, if you would do like I did, go ahead and buy all four volumes of ""JAMES BOND ULTIMATE EDITION."" Because this ""Frame by Frame Digital Restoration & Superior Sound,"" are the best ever experienced by yours truly, worth it's price. ""THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST RESTORATIONS IN PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY EVER!"" Even some stores have it this week on an 'Special $100' for both Volumes,' if purchased at the same time, SO BUY IT WHILE THIS PRICES LAST AND SAVE!

Beside I love their box presentation, for it comes in a beautifull compact set, and each movie inside comes with it's own booklet, as well as on this two DVD disks per movie 'The Special Features Libraries,' are awesome and superb too. ASK NO MORE QUESTION ABOUT IT. You all should feel confident, while deciding to buy this new Bond's Collections. Because the ""Color Of The Old Movies In Your Bond's Library"" would look pale, when you compare it with what you get in this new ones: 'THIS IS IT, THE ULTIMATE BOND EXPERIENCE,' TRUST ME.

UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALSO ALONG TOO HAS SOME FLAWS, that it detracts us from having a ""100% DELIGHTFULL EXPERIENCE, WHILE VIEWING ALL THIS FILMS AS A PACK OF 20 MOVIES.""  But it is particularly noticeable only on this last 'VOLUME IV.' Since it seems that at least there were three ""Manufacturing Flaws Errors Made,"" while doing a ""FRAME-BY-FRAME DIGITAL RESTORATION."" ~~~ Because this films do ""PAUSE (FREEZE) SLIGHTLY,"" in some of this new DVD Movies. At first I went back to the Store and exchanged then, just thinking that they were a simple but reasonable, individual flaws found on the disks items purchased by me, in this Box set(VOLUME IV).

However the other replacement disks did also appeared to have the same FLAWS (PAUSE/FREEZE SLIGHTLY) ON THE SAME SPOTS. Two of these pauses are almost unnoticeable, but it still takes away from your concentration, if like me, you do intensely follows up the plot of this films. But one of those three glitch, is a very definetelly straightforward unfortunately noticeable, as well as disturbing, more so than the other two and therefore: ""IT IS UNFORGIVING, FOR THIS EXPENSIVE 'JAMES BOND ULTIMATE EDITION VOLUME IV TO HAVE.'""

I LIST THEM HERE FOR YOUR INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: ~

1/ 'THE UNFORGIVEN FLAW' Happens in the film ""MOONRAKER,"" This movie PAUSE/FREEZE for a very unfortunate noticiable moment on FRAME: ('C16 59:25 MINUTES.') While Bonds enters an Alley in Rio de Janeiro, right after the Carnival Sequence.

2/ 'The Second One Happens' in the Film ""OCTOPUSSY,"" this one is almost unnoticeable, but for a fraction of a second: THE MOVIE PAUSE/FREEZE ON FRAME: ('C19 1:12:49 MINUTES.') As ""Q"" looks up for James Bond by the river side with his binoculars, it is followed up by the next scene, were Bond and Octopussy are walking, while she is telling him her occupation story. Because this flaw pause, did happened at the ending of one brief scene, followed by a more important scene, this glitch is almost imperceptible, but nevertheless still it is there! unfortunately, in an otherwise flawless film restoration. WHAT A DAMN PITY!

3/ THE THIRD PAUSE/FREEZE, not unlike the one described here for ""OCTOPUSSY,"" happens in the feature film ""TOMORROW NEVER DIES."" Here the film for a fraction of a second too: THE MOVIE PAUSE/FREEZE ON FRAME: ('C17 58:10 MINUTES.') As James Bond once finding in his hotel room dead, his ex-paramour Paris Carver, wife of media empire mogul Elliot Carver; facing her killer, slightly smile/twinkle at ""The Dr,"" as this one still holding a gun pointing at Bond declare: ""I feel like an idiot, I do not know what to said."" ~~~ Once again the changing of the camera viewing angle mask so well this ""freeze frame,"" almost to the point of flawlessness. But it is nevertheless still there for the discerning eye to catch, in an otherwise excelent ""James Bond Perfect Film Restoration.""

I HAVE BY NOW SEEN ALL THE FILMS IN ""VOLUME III AND HAVE NOT SPOTTED ANY PROBLEMS IN THEM,"" THEREFORE, SO FAR THESE ARE THE ONLY FLAWS FOUND IN ALL THE JAMES BOND'S FOUR VOLUMES. SINCE THOSE ""PAUSE/FREEZE FLAWS"" WERE NOT PRESENT IN 'VOLUME I & VOLUME II,' OR IF THERE ARE SOME TOO, THEM IT ESCAPED MY NOTICE AND ATTENTION.

Still this new ""JAMES BOND ULTIMATE EDITION' overall is a ""JEWEL,"" and most definitively is worth buying it, once you are first put on notice, about all this short faults in the way that they were ""Remastered, Transfered and Restored.""

SO IF YOU BOUGHT THEM, PLEASE, DO NOT RETURN TO THE STORES FOR AN EVEN EXCHANGE, SINCE ALL THIS FLAWS IN THE MOVIES ARE IN ALL OF THEM AT THOSE DESCRIBED HERE POINTS.

Like to conclude with the hope that this review was helpfull, and also would save you all ""Time and Money."" MAY THEM, YOU HAVE HAPPY HOLIDAYS & A VERY PEACEFULL NEW YEAR TO ALL, ON THIS MOTHER EARTH.",1166140800,5,5792,4.654598825831703
2655330,5,B000ICM5VC,"I got all of them as a early gift for myself but the new ""Ultimate Edition"" is missing one of the Bond movies. Never Say Never Again. Where is it? Every other bond movie is here but not that one...",1165881600,,197,3.95
2655331,5,B000ICM5VC,"I, for one, have no objection to this new packaging of the beautifully remastered films and their lavish extras. This series is like the old joke about pizza (and sex)--even when it's not-so-good, it's still pretty good. These films are such a big, big part of our culture--all of them. All the actors playing Bond. The whole shebang. I appreciate that there are those out there who only want certain titles--and they should be available that way--but I say, ""Bring 'em all on!"" I'm loving this collection!

DR. NO is the first and freshest, with Connery the first (and best) Bond and Andress the first (and best) girl. YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE has that marvelous volcano and that lovely song, possibly the best song in the series. MOONRAKER is just plain silly, but kind of fun. OCTOPUSSY is big and colorful. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is kind of blah, but it has Michelle Yeoh, who is not blah, and those stunts, which are anything but blah.",1164758400,4,932,4.648484848484848
2655332,5,B000ICM5VC,"This collection includes various Bond movies from three of the actors that have played James Bond in the ""official"" Bond movies, which excludes ""Never Say Never Again.""  I have a couple of complaints about the four collections, balanced by some significant positives.

My two biggest complaints are that the movies are not in order, which continues the tradition begun with the previous James Bond Collections, and these movies are so good when compared to the originals that fan of the James Bond movies will want to have these, which means you have to shell out a lot of money to buy these movies over again.

The most significant positives about these movies are the improved sound and picture quality, and the second disk that comes with each movie that includes material uncollected in the original James Bond Collections.  If you have the previous James Bond Collections and you have watched them only once, then you can probably pass this collection over.  If you watched the previous James Bond Collections and you thought the picture and sound could have been improved, and you wished for more extras, then you may want to shell out the big bucks and buy these four sets.

Two of Sean Connery and two of Roger Moore's films are in this fourth set.  The first Connery film is ""Dr. No.""  ""Dr. No"" launched the Bond franchise.  Sean Connery set the tone for Bond; suave, debonair, and terminally cool.  He drove nice cars and had a penchant for dry one-liners.  Ursula Andress set the tone for future Bond women, and Dr. No was coolly ruthless.  Ken Adam's sets were artistic and artfully filmed by Terence Young, who also provided the stylistic role model for Connery's Bond.  In the extras you learn that Connery was mentored by Young and acquired expensive tastes and hobbies in the process.

The second Connery film was the fifth Bond film.  ""You Only Live Twice"" had more gadgets, more exotic locations, and more jokes than previous Bond films.  Someone is hijacking Soviet and American spacecraft and no one knows why.  After one of the best opening credits where Nancy Sinatra sings the title song, we enter one of the weaker entries in the Bond series.  There is too much reliance on gadgets and women and too little reliance on a serious plot.  I also struggled to believe Donald Pleasance as the evil Dr. Blofeld.

Roger Moore's first film in this collection is another of the weaker films in the Bond series.  ""Moonraker"" was intended to capitalize on the public's interest in science fiction movies sparked by ""Star Wars.""  However, this movie is not close to ""Star Wars,"" and the spaceship effects are relatively cheesy.  However, the space station is reasonably well done.  This time madman Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) plans to park his chosen people on a space station while he eliminates all people on earth.  His chosen people will then repopulate the earth with their perfection.  Drax is a suitable madman for Bond.  The popular character Jaws (Richard Kiel) appears again in this movie.  Unfortunately, Moore appears generally bored with this one and this movie just never sparks.

Moore's second film in this collection is ""Octopussy.""  When agent 009 turns up stabbed with a valuable jeweled egg, James Bond is on the case.  His investigation leads him to India, where he learns that Kamal Khan is involved in a number of activities, some of them apparently involving Octopussy, a female smuggler who makes her home on an island where there are only women.  As the movie unfolds we learn that General Orlov has been plotting with Kamal Khan to use the military superiority of the Soviet Union to show the world that the Soviet Union remains a potent world power.  Kamal Khan's interest is money, however, and he cares little for Orlov's activities other than how he can benefit from them.

The final film in this collection is 1997's ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""  The supporting cast this time is phenomenal, with the great actor Jonathan Pryce as Elliot Carver, Teri Hatcher as his wife Paris Carver, and Michelle Yeoh as Chinese agent Wei Lin, among numerous others.  Jonathan Pryce steals nearly every scene he is in, reminiscent of some other great Bond villains.  The locations are ever more incredible, digital effects abound, and the stunts are even more thrilling.  That motorcycle jump was really performed!  Cheryl Crow does a great job on the title song, and the excellent video is included.

Because of all the extras these DVDs require hours to watch.  The value of the extras varies, but watching them gives a fan much more information about the difficulties of making each movie, and how many of the stunts were performed.  I consider these movies to be among the gems of my DVD collection.  I recommend this set very highly if you are just starting to collect Bond movies, are looking to replace your VHS versions, or you must have the best versions available.

Enjoy!",1163203200,8,4907,4.846153846153846
2655333,5,B000ICM5VC,"Why does title always seem to be ommitted from any bond collection release? Connery in a remake of Thunderball....  Is this not a relesae by the same production company?  It is a MGM release, so why doesn't it ever get included?  Any light that can be shed would be greatly appreciated...",1163030400,,288,4.607843137254902
2655334,5,B000ICM5VC,"Hi all you Bond fans!...

I don't understand what all the big disappointment is with the order of the films in these sets!!!  Sure, it'd be nice if everything was in chronological order, but who are we to decide that?

The amount of hard work that went into the making of these sets, and the quality of the sets themselves, are nothing to disregard!  I don't understand how anybody could put chronological order over the quality of something itself...  If you really wanted what was in these sets, then how can you argue over the order of the DVD's in them???

To me, the makers did a fantastic job of ordering them, because then the not-so-popular movies get somewhere to live too!  How would you feel if you had to release sets in an order that not so many people would buy a certain volume of, just because less people liked what was in it?  You have to respect the makers' wishes, and go for it.

I, myself, am profoundly interested in these sets, and to me... they are a MUST to have!  I can see how people who have already bought the previous DVD sets would be upset, but I think these sets justify re-buying them 100%.  (Too bad these North American releases aren't in the attache case, though!)

As another reviewer (Eric D. Zdrojewski ""Lockport Eric"") said, you can sell your other DVD sets (if you wanted to), and you'd have a decent amount to go for these sets.

... and as another reviewer on here (The JuRK) said... I'm definitely getting these for Christmas this year too!!!  :-D

Thanks,

Mike Sorge",1162857600,11,1514,4.470802919708029
2655335,5,B000ICM5VC,"I personally have owned every James Bond adventure that has been released on Video and now on DVD. I own all the Laser Discs that were available right up to Tomorrow Never Dies and I still own the three DVD box sets that were released several years ago. I believe it is possible that they are merchandising these new DTS boxsets in such a way as to gather more sales based on more popular films in the series, but these are all good films ""There are no stinkers in the bunch"". I want you to tell me if George Lucas had twenty one Star Wars adventures that they would be as good as the James Bond series has been so far. The answer is no, and with one difference, recently the movies have become more socially accepted with James Bond doing a year and a half in prison, and characters that were killed and in some cases profanity, but never I mean never any nudity. I don't miss nudity in these films they are here to be entertaining not only for adults, but children as well. I as a child also saw these films and I would guess I have seen each at least a dozen times. You are hearing from cheap skates on these comments who are whining about the cost of the new DVD's, but you need to say are they worth the price, I say Yes!!",1162512000,6,1227,4.138075313807532
2655336,4,B000ICM5VC,"This is one of the weaker volumes but I'll still give it a good rating since I plan on getting all four volumes.  As I've said in my reviews of the other volumes, I'm going to get the entire series for the first time in my life.

Fans can and will bicker about which Bond was the best (there are fans of every single one of them) and which film was the best (again, there are tireless supporters from DR. NO to DIE ANOTHER DAY), but I'll be content to have them all and have the plethora of extras for each one.

For example, I've never been a big fan of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE--come on, Connery looks bored for literally the entire movie--but the extras look very interesting.

The only homerun in this last volume is DR. NO, the first.  But I'm sure YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, OCTOPUSSY, TOMORROW NEVER DIES and MOONRAKER have their defenders and rabid admirers.",1162252800,3,855,4.31875

2655411,5,B000ICM5VC,"The highlights here are DR. NO, YOU ONLY LVE TWICE and OCTUPUSSY. These three Bond films are ground breaking in several ways.

I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country. Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films. These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role. Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here. Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key. DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond. But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE contained elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back, it somehow worked loosely when put together yet, till this day I cannot determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles. The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment.

In MOONRAKER I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions.

OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit. The score by John Barry is a little vague. The action scenes he scored didn't have his old punch. It was like he was in a transitional state. He scored the early scenes very well and they had that unique Bond sound that he used to bring to the earlier films. As the film progressed the score seemed to become repetitious and tedious. He did do a good job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for ""The Quiller Memorandum."" To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. ""For Your Eyes Only"" filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die.""

TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best of the Bonds. Roger Spottiswoode did a bang-up job as director handling the action sequences and delivering the script's more timely and coherent storyline to the screen. Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. This is the only Brosnan-Bond film where the team of M, Moneypenny, Charles Robinson and Q work as a very efficient and cohesive unit. When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film. He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series.",1381708800,,8150,4.843615494978479

Dr. No is the 1st big screen appearance of Bond and the great Connery brings him in to film history with style. It is dated today in many ways but still a good show all the way. Ursila Andress still has the sexiest entrance of any actress on film to date.
You Only Liv Twice is just sort of bloated all around but what fun to watch. Great stunts and wonderful sets as well as Connery looking a little paunchy but still doing Bond better than all of them.
Moonraker and Octopussy were Moore's cheesy collection to the franchise. They are good but quite out of the realm of believable. He was getting too old to carry the role and it was showing. Still great sets and locations can carry the day and do. Worth seeing.

2655449,5,B000ICM5VC,"ULTIMATE EDITION INTRO (applies to all 4 Volumes)
I think fans need to accept that James Bond 007 won't be divided into chronological DVD sets, anymore.  Because these movies are drastically different from each other in terms of style, plot, background, and audiences' & critics' reception... the most sensible move is to divide them up.  Thankfully, all of the special features from older DVDs, plus some new bonus content, are on these Ultimate Edition sets.

VOLUME 4
With the exception of the first ""official"" James Bond movie on this set, I think this 4th volume represents the more action-packed side of 007.  Bond becomes Japanese and trains with ninjas.  Bond gets a sidekick who kicks even more ass than he does.  Bond goes to space, for crying out loud!  I suppose after reviewing the other 3 volumes, I've run out of things to say about this franchise.  But each movie on this set is worth a look.

DR. NO (1962 - Movie #1)
---Ah, the first time that James Bond was ""officially"" brought to world-wide audiences (that 1950s TV play of ""Casino Royale"" doesn't count).  I feel I should warn newcomers who haven't watched this movie yet, because while the character will be instantly familiar, this is the most low-key, modest picture in the entire franchise.  After all, how could anyone know ""Dr. No"" would be successful enough to spawn a franchise anyway?  James Bond is introduced to us when we see his hands playing baccarat, and his voice flirting with his opponent.  The first time we see his face is when he gives that immortal introduction, ""Bond...James Bond.""  When Sean Connery speaks those words, he commands our attention immediately.  Agent 007 is sent to Jamaica after an agent has disappeared.  The movie is more of a mystery than an adventure.  Shady characters turn out to be allies.  Lovely locals turn out to be dangerous.  What separates James Bond from any other detective though is his confidence and willingness to get his hands dirty.  Watch the way he dispenses his first henchman, and then casually carries on after the bad guy kills himself.  Much has been made about Honey Ryder, the iconic beauty played by Ursula Andress, but I think this character is badly overrated.  She's hot and interesting, but nothing legendary.  Come to think of it, I prefer the slower first half to the second half when Bond goes to a remote island, finds the villain's lair, with a beautiful woman tagging along.  I know the second half is what most Bond movies are known for, but it feels more dated that it did 10 years ago when I first saw it.  But for the most part, ""Dr. No"" is a solid mystery, and the elusive villain is intriguing.  (7.0 / 10)

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967 - Movie #5)
---Aside from a really dumb introduction to James Bond (he fakes his death so that his worldwide enemies won't look for him), this movie finds a fun story and runs with it.  An American shuttle is stolen in space, and the USA & Russia are on the brink of war.  The leads point to Japan, where James Bond's investigation leads to one of the most action-packed entries in the 007 series.  The fight scenes are intense and exciting, and the final battle between the villain's army and ally Tanaka's ninjas is simply awesome.  The whole Japanese setting is just pleasing to the eye.  I love Nancy Sinatra's song and John Barry's music score.  There are some pretty odd plot points, though.  A sexy henchwoman captures Bond, makes love with him rather than kill him, and then tries to kill him in the very next scene!  Also, the plan to make Bond blend in with his Japanese ally by becoming Japanese makes no sense when several assassins try to take him out while he's training.  But I quickly forgot about the plot stumbles because the movie moves at such a nice pace and has such great style & action that I quickly forgave those missteps.  (7.5 / 10)

MOONRAKER (1979 - Movie #11)
---I have very mixed feelings about this Roger Moore movie.  It's basically a hybrid of director Lewis Gilbert's ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", with some silly comedy thrown in.  The good news is that this mostly-engaging movie is incredible when it works.  The villain, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), is delightfully egomaniacal, and is one of the few bad guys whose elaborate deathplans for 007 actually fit the character.  The action is very exciting (except for a dumb Venice boat chase).  And when the story goes to space (sorry if I spoiled that), ""Moonraker"" somehow makes it all work and becomes a terrific entertainment.  The problem I have is that when ""Moonraker"" tries to be funny, it often comes at the wrong time.  Bond literally shoots a tree-perched assassin right in front of Drax's eyes, and trusts that Drax's driver will still take him to the airport.  Every time fan-favorite Jaws shows up, his attempts to kill 007 are filled with some comedic punchline.  He can't kill Bond because a bunch of Rio partiers get in the way, and he can't kill Bond because he breaks his own parachute strap.  I missed the combination of sinister and humor in Jaws from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".  And what's with Jaws' goldilocks girlfriend, anyway?  Never mind.  ""Moonraker"" is a Bond movie that isn't afraid to try anything.  For the most part, it worked for me, especially in its final act.  (7.0 / 10)

OCTOPUSSY (1983 - Movie #13)
---This one of the toughest Roger Moore movies to talk about, because its greatest qualities come at some costly prices, just like ""Moonraker"" felt to me.  I think every Bond movie has some give-and-take involved; the difference with fans is whether you gain more than you are asked to forgive.  In the case of ""Octopussy"", I like it overall, but was annoyed by some aspects of it.  The plot involves Bond tracing a forged Faberge egg to a prince named Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan, whose speech mannerisms are always captivating).  Bond's encounters with Kamal Khan and his henchmen are mostly entertaining, but then when 007 is captured, it takes a while to find out just what the heck is going on.  When Bond discovers that a mysterious smuggler named Octopussy (Maud Adams in her 2nd 007 appearance) is involved, I was initially confused how she fit into the whole plot.  When I figured out how the Russian General Orlov (Steven Berkoff) was going to bring his plans of global domination into the mix, I still didn't understand how he related to the other two.  This sense of mystery is both a great delight and a bit frustrating.  The questions are all answered, but I think the movie needed better pacing to let me know when I was supposed to be in on it.  ""Octopussy"" uses the Eastern Europe and India locations very well, but each of its exciting action sequences has something to distract me from it.  For example, an exciting jungle hunt for 007 includes our hero letting out a Tarzan yell as he dangles from vine to vine.  I must say that the stuntwork in ""Octopussy"" is top-notch, like when Roger Moore's stunt doubles climb a speeding train or hang onto an airborne plane for dear life.  Overall, I think ""Octopussy"" is a solid movie, but when the plot took its mysterious twists and turns, I wished the movie would've focused more on the dramatic stakes than its carefree sense of fun.  (6.5 / 10)

TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997 - Movie #18)
---What a novel concept we have here.  A man attempts to control the world through mass-media manipulation.  Don't be mad at me if I spoiled that for you, because when Elliot Carver (a scene-chewing Jonathan Pryce) holds the movie's first meeting with his cohorts, you know exactly what he's capable of.  This adventure takes this fascinating plot point, and pits James Bond against the media baron's schemes.  After a pointless-but-fun pre-title sequence, Bond is tasked to use a former flame (now Carver's wife) to get closer.  Along the way, Bond runs into a Chinese agent named Wei Lin, who's played by Asian action star Michelle Yeoh.  Their combination of skills and witty banter is one of the movie's best aspects.  Yet, I can't say why I'm not giving this movie a stronger recommendation.  I think that's because ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" features a lot of action, with less emphasis on the spy elements of James Bond.  I love the chase sequences and hand-to-hand combat, but some of the shootouts are a bit outrageous.  In other words, as well-crafted as the movie is, I was constantly aware that most Bond movies tend to have similar moments.  ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" does it better than most 007 movies, but it didn't do it first.  If you're looking for originality beyond Elliot Carver's dastardly plans, then you might be a tad disappointed.  But if you want bigger, badder, and better, then Pierce Brosnan's sophomore appearance doesn't slump.  (7.5 / 10)

VOLUME 4 RECAP
Although this is my least favorite collection of James Bond 007 movies, I wouldn't call this a throwaway.  After all, I do like every movie that's included on this set.  But if there's one Volume of the Ultimate Edition collection that I'd get last, it'd be this 4th one.

2655453,5,B000ICM5VC,"As I watch these movies, I'll give them a review so, first thing's first:

Dr. No- Probably one of the best Bond films, next to OHMSS, FYEO & LTK, that doesn't use an excess of gadgets. CR (2006) was good but used too much flash & bang. Same thing goes for QOS, way too much bang and not enough story. Anyway, Connery's debut as the suave secret agent is a better outing for him than some of his later ones. His portrayal is tough yet sophisticated whereas Craig is just tough with little to no sophistication. An excellent Bond villain in Dr. No, who is not afraid to get into a fight if his plans go bad. Honey Ryder is your typical Bond girl but at least they don't make her to be an ""equal"" of Bond or cast the then unknown Andress as something outrageous like a nuclear physicist. The story of toppling missiles is good and doesn't seem dated. I wish they had hired John Barry for the music because that is department where this movie is lacking. 4 stars.

You Only Live Twice- From an action point of view, this is one of the better Bonds. The Little Nellie fight sequence is one of the most thrilling aerial assaults in cinema history along with the ninja attack as the climax. The casting is also to be commended, as this is probably one of the few films that I own with a large Japanese cast. Tanaka is a likeable character, played amiably by Tetsuro Tamba (and also one of the few foreign allies in a Bond film who doesn't get killed off). I do wish though that Aki's part was bigger and didn't get killed off compared to Kissy's. Bond had more time to develop a relationship with her before she was poisoned whereas, at first, Kissy doesn't want to be involved with Bond, stating their feigned marriage is ""just business"" and then all of a sudden she's all over him. Karin Dor's Helga Brandt is very reminiscent, though probably more the writer's trying to clone Fiona Volpe from the previous film, but Dor does the best that she can with a role that is pretty much a copy. Donald Pleascence does a good job as Blofeld but doesn't, to me anyway, come off as a real intimidating threat like Telly Savalas does in the next one. Maybe they should've held off the big reveal of Bond's arch-enemy until OHMSS. Japan is a beautiful setting, getting to see some of the local culture like sumo wrestling and, I'm not entirely sure on this one, a Japanese wedding. Contrary to many others saying this is one of his best (OHMSS being the best), I don't like John Barry's score for this one, nor is the title song one of my particular favorites, though some of my favorite bits are during the outer space sequences and the big attack on Blofeld's volcano. 3 stars.

Moonraker- James Bond in space! Despite this, like TMWTGG, being ""rather silly"" and not a favorite among fans, this is one of my favorites. Its just pure fun escapism. And its a little more believeable than an invisible car. Lois Chiles is a step up from Barbara Bach in the acting department (and better than most of the women Brosnan would deal with), but when it comes to showing emotion or a sense of urgency in a situation, she falls flat (which what her acting is in some scenes). Her character does handle the action very well, and like Back, doesn't try to steal the limelight from Moore (unlike Halle Berry, who I just plain don't like). Michael Lonsdale is more interesting a villain than Stromberg, despite both characters having the same goal of creating a master race/new world. Lonsdale just seems like a more legitimate threat in how he handles things and how he plans on disposing Bond. Richard Kiel has more of a comedic role in this one but is nonetheless threatening (like when he's walking down the alley dressed as the clown in Rio). Unfortunately, this is Bernand Lee's final film as M (he would die just before filming began on FYEO) and we do not get a decent actor in the role until Dame Judi Dench. The action sequences continue to get better (such as the opening free fall sequence and the gondola chase). Stated earlier, this is pretty much a rehash of TSWLM but at least goes about it in a different way. At least Drax comes closer to his goal than Stromberg did. And thank goodness they went with an original story for this one instead of the plot of the book (it was an interesting story, it just plodded along too slowly). John Barry gives us more strings in his score and his 007 theme is played for (for now at least) the last time in a more slower arrangement. And Shirely Bassey returns for her third title song, which like the movie, is one of my favorite themes; a beautifully sung ballad and not some piece of trash (here's lookin' at you Madonna). 5 stars.

Octopussy- A risque title. But nonetheless, one of my favorites. People tend to not like the Moore films because they're not as ""serious"" as some of the Connery, Brosnan and especially Dalton and Craig but like I've said before, movies, especially action movies, a form of escapism and not to be taken (too) seriously). Again, using a short story title and utilizing the basic plot of them; the Faberge Egg (Property of a Lady) and the backstory of Maj. Dexter Smythe (Octopussy), the main plot is original and very good. Moore is showing a little age in this one but loses none of his charm and grace and can still handle the action and love scenes. Maud Adams returns to the series as the titular character, and she is one of the more interesting Bond girls as she is a good yet bad girl and you can tell her morals collide during the circus scene whether she chooses to believe Bond about the bomb or listen to Magda. Louis Jourdan is suave as Khan and oozes evil but a kind of aristotic evil previously seen in Scaramanga, Blofeld and Dr. No. Unfortunately, Kabir Bedi's Gobinda is just a poor knockoff of Oddjob, right down to squeezing the dice into dust. But he does talk more and involved more in Khan's plans than Oddjob was with Goldfinger. The action scenes feature more great ones from the series. The pre-title Acrostar jet sequence is suspenseful and you can hardly tell that Moore is in front of a projection screen (which I must also commend on NSNA's scenes featuring the missiles and Connery and Casey in the jet-propulsion vehicles and the flying scenes in Superman III). John Barry returns to the franchise, giving a lush, exotic score. And despite what people say, I enjoy Rita Coolidge's title song (because lets face it, you could never get Octopussy into a lyric.) 5 stars.

Tomorrow Never Dies- 1997 was obviously the year for sinking ships. This is definitely more action packed than GoldenEye but the story in this is actually intriguing. A media mogul plans to manipulate two governments into a war just for ratings? Hm, sounds like a plan concocted by the diabolical CNN or Fox News, doesn't it? Not really, I'm giving those networks far too much credit. Brosnan is back as Bond and we get a little emotional glimpse into his past with his relationship with Paris Carver (played by Teri Hatcher of Lois & Clark fame at the time and was still looking very attractive). You can tell how pained Bond is when he finds her dead in his hotel room. Jonathan Pryce is one of my favorite Bond villains as you can clearly tell that he doesn't care who he ruins just as long as he gets the story first. My favorite scene with Carver is when he's showing off his headlines to Bond and says about his favorite; ""I rather like the last one. It isn't even mine."" Michelle Yeoh is a good Bond girl and, like the female agents of TSWLM, MR and LTK, Wai Lin doesn't completely overshadow Bond but still makes an impact as a character. Most of Carver's subordinates are bland, like Stamper (who's pretty much an acting block of wood) and Gupta (very, very bland and woodlike) but Vincent Schiavelli's Dr. Kaufman is a brilliant, evil but very humorous character. David Arnold becomes the regular Bond composer with this film and he does an admirable job but I have two complaints; one, he uses the Bond theme a little too much when compared to previous films and two, he doesn't know when to stop playing the music. I think I can count the scenes on one hand when there isn't any music. Sheryl Crowe's title song is one of my least favorite while k.d. Lang's version is far superior though regulated to the end credits and surprisingly used as orchestration when compared to the title song. 4 stars.",1247875200,,8373,4.502301117685733

The picture is like night and day from the special edition. They did an incredible restoration of these films and added a 5.1 DTS to all. They look amazing on my HD TV . I did a side by side comparison and the Ultimate edition is a huge improvement in picture and audio quality. Love all these movies especially the older ones with Moore, Lazenby, Connery, and Dalton. They look like they were filmed yesterday and have terrific extras. I'm curious to know how much better the picture is on the bluray because I don't think you can get better than this especially for older movies that had no High Def cameras in those days.

2655466,4,B000ICM5VC,"Hard to believe now, but on its first release Dr No, the film that started it all, was sold as much on the scenery as anything else. In the days before foreign package holidays really took off, the glamorous locations gave the low-budget film an exotic look that helps hide some of its limitations.

Terence Young, Cubby Broccoli and co-writer Richard Maibaum had all previously worked together on the Alan Ladd starrer The Red Beret - indeed, many of the Bond regulars had worked on Broccoli's fairly undistinguished British pictures - and at times the initial uncertainty of tone is noticeable, with the film occasionally threatening to turn into a predictable British `quota quickie' at times. Young's direction of some of the early scenes is, it must be said, rather ham-handed - indeed, turn down the colour and you could be watching an early episode of The Saint. You can even see the arc lights reflected on the paintwork of the getaway car at (something that would become one of the series less recognised trademarks in the Connery years!).

Its attitude to the black characters is also rather less than enlightened - not just Bond treating Quarrel like a houseboy (""Fetch me my slippers, Quarrel."") but also the way John Kitzmiller is required to turn into Stepinfetchit in the `dragon' scene. Considering British films' strong record on tackling racial issues in the 50s and 60s up to the sixties, this may possibly be attributable to the fact that the Bond films, while British, were always produced by an American and a Canadian: certainly Hollywood was somewhat lagging behind British cinema on the race relations front at the time. But if you can ignore that, there's much to enjoy: Connery introducing himself with the immortal ""Bond, James Bond"" for the first time and Joseph Wiseman's superb villain's equally memorable entrance (""One million dollars, Mr Bond.""); Ursula Andress emerging from the sea; the spooky Sisters Rose and Lily; and some good action scenes.

The film also has a darker tone than any its successors until Casino Royale. Bond is quite cold blooded in a way he never was again during Broccoli Sr and Saltzman's watch, be it sleeping with a girl while he waits for the police to arrest her or waiting for Dent to empty his gun before killing him (""That's a Smith and Wesson and you've had your six.""). Similarly, Honey is not above the use of a Black Widow spider on those who have wronged her (""It took him a whole week to die,"" she tells Bond matter-of-factly).

Sadly, while pitched as the `Ultimate Edition,' the transfer on this repackaged two-disc edition is still problematic. The picture quality is certainly improved over the original single-disc issue, but rather than the original British 1.66:1 ratio, it's presented in the cropped 1.85:1. There aren't many new features - featurettes on restoring the films, the premiere and a 1964 archive featurette `The Guns of James Bond.' Most of the features from the original release have been carried over (with the exception of a double-bill trailer which can be found on the From Russia With Love Ultimate Edition), though accessing the film is more laborious than it needs to be as you work your way through logos, promos, dull but unskippable `set' menus that take you to another menu that take you to a sub-menu that take you to another logo and not one but two copyright warnings before you can get anywhere near the film or a special feature (a feature on all the Ultimate Editions, as are the poorly designed, slow and far too small stills galleries). By the time you've gone through all that, you'll feel like Jack Lemmon in The Apartment. So, not quite the ultimate presentation...

Faced with box-office rivalry from the spoof Casino Royale the same year, EON put aside their plans to follow Thunderball with OHMSS and pulled out all the stops to promise the biggest and best-paced Bond to date with You Only Live Twice. While they failed to match the phenomenal success of Thunderball - still the biggest ticket seller in the series' history by a huge margin - this certainly is the best of the special effects show Bonds, and for many it's scarred, bald, Persian-cat stroking super-villain ensconced in his hollowed-out volcano lair plotting to start a world war is the quintessential Bond movie villain. Departing from Ian Fleming's novel in all but name and boasting a plot the producers were so taken with that they've used it at least twice since The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, both also directed by Lewis Gilbert), but by 1967 the series was already beginning to feed off itself - the pre-title sequence where Bond is killed is more or less borrowed from From Russia With Love.

After years as an offscreen presence voiced by Eric Pohlman, S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s Ernst Stavro Blofeld finally makes his first on-screen appearance in the form of Donald Pleasance (causing that awkward continuity problem in the subsequent OHMSS where he fails to recognise Bond), with Charles Gray preceding his turn in the role on the side of the angels as our man in Japan, getting his vodka from the doorman at the Russian embassy (""among OTHER things""). This time the villains work for a large Japanese industrial company to cash-in on the Connery films' popularity in the Japanese market while offering some colorful locations, but action, not scenery, is the order of the day here. The action scenes themselves are terrific and often imaginatively shot (as with the long overhead helicopter shot in the fight at Kobe Docks) and the production values are still the best of the entire series. Visually it is certainly the best looking of the series thanks to Freddie Young's incredible photography, while Ken Adams production design is superb and the lush score marked a real turning point for John Barry.

Roald Dahl's screenplay strangely discards Blofeld's garden of death (too downbeat said the producers) and omits Bond's Japanese counterpart Tanaka's background as an ex-Kamikaze pilot (too sensitive) but has just the right internal logic to justify its outrageous elements, as well as some neat humorous touches (such as Bond being constantly castigated for his smoking). Although many fans were critical of his approach - Dahl made little secret of his opinion that Bond was a 'resourceful but rather insensitive fellow' - he is more astute about the character than many writers in the series, bringing Bond's smug superiority to the fore in lines like ""You forget I took a First in Oriental languages at Cambridge.""

It's particularly disappointing that the 2-disc set only includes five minutes of the very entertaining and surprisingly comprehensive hour-long Whicker's World special on the making of the film, which revealed Connery's fondness for Custard Creams. We do get the glossier and less interesting 48-minute Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond (which makes an injoke of the fact that OHMSS had originally been scheduled to be made that year by having an unseen actress complain that she was supposed to be Mrs Bond) and Ken Adams' home movie footage, but there's not enough new from the original single-disc edition to justify the `Ultimate Edition' tag here.

Roger Moore's biggest box-office hit during his tenure as Bond, Moonraker has seen its reputation plummet to the point where its widely regarded as the worst film in the entire series. It's not exactly difficult to see why. The ill-advised jokes that end the otherwise stunningly shot pretitle sequence of Jaws and a parachuteless Bond battling midair unfortunately give a hint of what is to come, but for the first 35 minutes it chugs along very competently, even throwing in one good setpiece in a G-Force simulator. Then comes the gondola/hovercraft sequence, a setpiece that abandons any notion of internal logic for cheap gags and illustrates one of the film's biggest problems: there's no real menace when we know Bond doesn't need to rely on his wits because he's got an absurd gadget for every occasion, and without any sense of threat the action scenes constantly fall flat. Many of them aren't even particularly well-staged but look rather haphazardly thrown together. Worse still, by offering the second consecutive reworking of You Only Live Twice's plot (all from the same director, Lewis Gilbert) it all feels like it's just going through the motions because they can't think of anything better to do.

While it doesn't show the contempt for Bond that Octopussy seemed to revel in as it seemed to go out of its way to humiliate Bond by making him literally butt of all the jokes, it constantly winks at the audience as if to say ""We know it's nonsense, but at least it's very expensive nonsense."" Unfortunately, it does set up two of the least welcome future developments in the series - as well as being the one where the product placement started to get out of control (my, didn't 7-Up and British Airways do well?), it also started the unfortunate tradition of the Michael G. Wilson cameo. Still, it's nice to see Bernard Lee getting to play a warmer M in his final Bond, finally proud of the boy (the film is very much the end of an era, with most of the surviving members of the old team breaking up - this was Lee, Gilbert and Ken Adam's last film), the great special effects are genuinely impressive even 28 years on and Michel Lonsdale provides the series with one of its best villains and gets all the best lines (""Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him"") even if he is wasted by the derivative plot.

There's not a huge amount in the way of new extras on this repackaged two-disc Ultimate Edition over the original one-disc issue several years ago - Roger Moore's audio commentary, a 1979 making of featurette, footage of the Rio shoot, test footage for the skydiving sequence and a couple of storyboard sequences. Sadly the teaser trailer sending up hairspray and perfume ads is still not included, although all the extras from the original edition have been carried over.

Facing up against a rival Bond project for the first time since You Only Live Twice - and one with Connery attached to boot - the obvious expectation was that once again the Broccoli camp would pull out all the stops and come up with one of the best Bond films yet. Instead, Octopussy is the one where they threw in the towel and began copying others rather than leading the pack.

For Your Eyes Only had gone head-to-head with Raiders of the Lost Ark and come off the worse. As a result, Octopussy shamelessly copies its market chase and truck sequences to remarkably little interest or excitement. Even the location seems second-hand - in 1982-3 you couldn't move for film crews in India, what with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, The Far Pavilions, The Jewel in the Crown, Gandhi and Heat and Dust all reviving the Raj. Only one sequence, with a deadly yo-yo (sometimes heavily cut in the TV prints  for some reason), works - and then only briefly.

Worse still, this one drags its feet more than any other entry in the series, with very long waits between very lacklustre setpieces. The plot is similarly uninvolving. With a similar hook to The Fourth Protocol, but nowhere near as good (and The Fourth Protocol isn't exactly a masterpiece), this is so alarmist it's a wonder Broccoli didn't hand over the producing reins to Euan Lloyd. Maud Adams makes a poor job of the title role, but Steven Berkoff is completely off the scale as the renegade Russian villain. With the diction of a demented Dalek and the subtlety of a Spitting Image puppet, it's quite an achievement to sit through any of his scenes without squirming in embarrassment.

The cheapest looking Bond film, it is doubtful that anyone would have gone to see such a geriatric action movie without the Bond name attached. The silly jokes are pretty pathetic - a snake charmer playing the Bond theme, a series of terrible tennis jokes built around Vijay Amritraj's appearance as Bond's ill-fated sidekick (British actor's union Equity actually tried to call a strike over his casting) - and would have been rejected from the very worst Carry On film. There's even some lovable xenophobia thrown in for good measure (""That'll keep you in curry for a few weeks."")

That it could have been worse is borne out by one of the DVD's most interesting extras - a series of screen tests with James Brolin as Bond. He gives it a good try, but he's trying to hard as if clearly aware that he's terrible casting. It's a moot point as to whether Brolin would have got the part had Connery's return to Bondage persuaded the producers to stick with the tried-and-trusted Roger Moore, but it would have been more of an impersonation than a performance if he had.

The history of the latter Bond films is one of false dawns, with sporadic good or near-great Bond films promptly followed by horribly disappointing ones. OHMSS was followed by the lazy Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me by Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only by Octopussy, and sadly Pierce Brosnan's enjoyable Bond debut GoldenEye remained true to form in being followed by another clunker. Tomorrow Never Dies was a famously troubled shoot, with a constantly rewritten unfinished script the most visible of its many problems. It's that classic `inbetween good Bonds' film that just feels like its treading water while they recharge their creative batteries for the next one. The premise may sound absurd - Jonathan Pryce's media mogul tries to start a war in Asia to boost circulation and viewing figures in return for local TV concessions - but it's a scam that William Randolph Hearst pulled for real in the Spanish-American War with his infamous telegram to a reporter ""You supply the pictures and I'll supply the war."" True, he didn't use a Stealth Ship or a guided drill-torpedo to do it, but the film almost pulls it off as a framework for a Bond movie. The problem is that, aside from David Arnold's excellent score, not much else really works.

Pryce isn't exactly a threatening supervillain and his henchmen are a rather bland bunch with the exception of Vincent Schiavelli's master assassin, who opts for broad overacting rather than menace. It may be an inspired idea to cast Michelle Yeoh as the leading lady, but with only one brief fight it seems rather pointless hiring one of the best action stars in the world if she doesn't get to do much. Worse, the action scenes are distinctly hit-and-miss. The pretitle sequence is terrific and the remote-controlled car chase one of the more enjoyable gadget showcases, but somehow the motorbike vs. helicopter chase through the streets and rooftops of Saigon never works nearly as well as it should: the footage is good but there's something almost haphazard about the editing that robs it of much of its potential. The film's big finale is little short of disastrous. Reputedly intended to be on a larger scale but scaled down because the effects shots wouldn't be ready in time for the film's opening date, there's literally nothing at stake by this point - with WW3 safely averted, all that's left for a somewhat bored Bond to do is walk around a badly designed and unappealingly photographed set shooting extras like he was in a bad video game before killing an old man with glasses.

Throw in lazy plotting and some of the worst dialogue in the series history and even the few promising ideas thrown up along the way tend to get lost in the hurry to get something releasable in the can. While Die Another Day is most Bond fans' choice for Brosnan's worst Bond, that at least threw up some good ideas in the first half - this feels like a film where no-one had a decent idea between them but were contractually obliged to deliver a movie in time for Christmas anyway. Horribly disappointing.

There's not a great deal of in the way of new extras to justify an upgrade if you have the previous special edition - aside from the extras carried over from that, there's a featurette on Moby's Bond theme remix, some redundant clips from the movie and some weak deleted scenes. Among them is an extended briefing scene in M's car where everyone is drinking cocktails that is so clumsily executed (every shot ends with them raising a glass to their lips) that it looks like an outtake from the old Thunderbirds TV series, so the film could clearly have been even worse, but that's scant consolation. As per all of the Brosnan Bond DVDs, there's no proper making of documentary either, just the odd puff-piece from its first release.

2655472,5,B000ICM5VC,"After waiting for a very long time to acquire the Bond Ultimate Edition sets at a reasonable price, I finally ditched my Special Editions in favor of the new ones. I, perhaps like many others, was always reluctant to give up my Special Editions because frankly I spent a lot of time and money putting the original, Special Edition set together.

After watching the Special Edition and Ultimate Edition of ""Dr. No"", I finally realized how ""ultimate"" the new discs are.  Gone are the film scratches, imperfections and faded colors that plagued most of the Bond early films such as the Connery & some of the Moore films. The new Dolby & DTS 5.1 surround sound are fantastic! The 1962 ""Dr. No"" looks like it was filmed yesterday.  The special features on ""Dr. No"" includes a segment on the outstanding work put into the frame by frame restoration. A truly tremendous effort and much appreciated!

I like the slim-line cases for the new sets. My entire Bond collection now only takes up less than half the space on my shelves than it did before.  Although I tend to agree with other reviewers that it's kind of cheesy how the booklets for each film are stored in the box and not the individual cases, the overall quality of the DVD's negate any negatives. I spend more time watching the films than browsing the booklets.  Forget buying any of the Ultimate Editions individually which are single discs because the DVD's in the Ultimate Edition box sets are double-disc sets. One disc for the feature film for optimized quality and one disc for the special features.

I'm not bothered in the fact that all films in all four volumes are not packaged chronologically, since I went through the same process when I purchased the Special Edition box sets. I understand the studio's logic for ""mixing it up"", since a chronological DVD order would mean more popular sales for the Connery sets and lower sales for the Moore/Dalton sets. I'm a fan of all the Bond films as I appreciate all of the different actors from Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Bronson to Craig and for what each one of them has contributed to the Bond Legacy. Many thanks to Daniel Craig for resurrecting this franchise with his outstanding debut in ""Casino Royale"". Looking forward to ""Quantum of Solace"" later this year.

VOLUME 4; This is my third favorite volume, but ""Dr. No"" (the Bond & Connery debut film) is a classic containing one of the most, iconic moments in Bond film history. Ursalla Andress in the white bikini walking in the beach from the ocean. Somehow I never get tired of that scene? Connery's other effort ""You Only Live Twice"" features some exotic Japan locations. Love that volcano base set! ""Moonraker"" is one of the most campiest Bond films for Moore, but having Jaws in it entertains. ""Octupussy"" should have been Moore's last film and I think it would have been a great send off film for Moore because it was quite good. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is a decent effort for Bronson featuring the acrobatic, martial arts, superstar Michelle Yeoh.",1210723200,2,3024,4.73574144486692

2655476,4,B000ICM5VC,"The brilliantly remastered library of James Bond films continues with ""James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 4"", a collection of titles that may have you scratching your head about the choices, but will dazzle with their pristine beauty, nonetheless!

""Dr. No"" (1962), was, of course, the first 007 film, and a huge gamble for both Broccoli/Saltzman's Eon Productions, and United Artists. With a tiny budget, a little-known leading man (Sean Connery), and a daring concept for a more conservative era (missions of a ruthless hero whose job was murder, and hobby, copious amounts of sex), the film succeeded because of tongue-in-cheek humor, explosive action, breathtaking women (personified by Ursula Andress), and Connery's charismatic presence. Until Daniel Craig's debut, this was as close to author Ian Fleming's vision of Bond as you could find, and what the film lacks in polish, it makes up for in intensity. (4 stars out of 5)

""You Only Live Twice"" (1967), has, over time, earned the ire of many Bond fans as the film Broccoli decided to do as Connery's first swan song, instead of the vastly superior ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (Japan offered a very lucrative production deal). As worldwide Bond mania subsided, this strange entry has a bored Connery machine-gunned, resurrected, piloting a toy helicopter, pretending to be Japanese, and often playing second-fiddle to Ninjas, while facing his LEAST threatening villain, Donald Pleasence. Even a beautiful theme song and breathtaking volcano finale can't save this entry. (2 stars out of 5)

""Octopussy"" (1983), is best-known as Roger Moore's entry in the year of competing Bond films (as Sean Connery's ""Never Say Never Again"" was also released). While both actors were 'long-in-the-tooth' as 007 (Moore was 55, Connery, 53), the Moore film offered Eon's customary opulence, a leading lady who could act (Maud Adams), and the unintentional humor of villain Louis Jourdan lisping ""Octopussy"". Great action scenes and beautiful locations (much of the story is set in India) were marred by the campiness that was, sadly, a trademark of the Moore films. (2 1/2 stars out of 5).

""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997), Pierce Brosnan's second outing as 007, finds him far more at ease and mature in the role than in ""GoldenEye"", and offers one of the best Bond leading ladies, Michelle Yeoh, as his Chinese counterpart. Jonathan Pryce, as a nerdy 'Ted Turner'-type media mogul, provides a wry spin on the traditional Bond villain. On the down side, Teri Hatcher's performance as a Bond ex-lover is amateurish, and the derivativeness that would plague all of Brosnan's films gives it a ""been there, done that"" feel. (3 1/2 stars out of 5)

""Moonraker"" (1979), one of the dumbest ideas for a 007 film, ever (""James Bond in Space!""), is, basically, a reworking of the vastly superior ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", moving the venue from the sea to Earth orbit. Silliness abounds, from Jaws and his blond nymphet girlfriend, to a gondola on wheels cruising the streets of Venice, to the ray-gun space battle climax. Michael Lonsdale looks more bored than villainous, and even a fabulous free-fall opening sequence can't save this Roger Moore entry. (1 1/2 stars out of 5)

2655479,5,B000ICM5VC,"Before buying this collection, I was very skeptical. Being a long time James Bond fan, I invested plenty of money in the best VHS version of all these films. When DVD came out, I re-bought about half of the collection again. I must admit that the DVD releases of these films are some of the most disappointing DVDs in my collection.

My major complaints about the ORIGINAL DVD RELEASES were:

1.) Audio Mix -- The first release of the Bond DVDs featured only the original 2 channel audio mixes. The result was a disaster. The spoken dialog was BURIED under the soundtrack... resulting in me having to dive for the remote every five minutes. On top of the poor dialog / score mixing, the audio lacked definition and served as a constant distraction from watching the movie. There were no distinct lows, or distinct highs, just a lot of bland sounding audio.

2.) Picture Quality -- I suppose I couldn't complain too too much about this one. Given the age of many of these movies, I accepted the washed-out, often grainy image as nothing more than a symptom of the era the movie was made.

All in all, poor audio and poor picture makes for a pretty crappy experience. After having been disappointed by the first couple Bond DVDs I bought, I gave up on the collection. It was with this in mind that the announcement of the newly remastered series left me very skeptical.

The major criticism of this DVD set is that it is another ploy by MGM/UA to drain more money from every Bond fan's wallet. In the past, I had avoided these pathetic attempts at getting me to constantly upgrade versions of things I already owned.

However, let me tell you, this collection DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. The talk about the upgraded audio and video is NOT hype. Painstaking efforts were taken to re-scan the original prints of each film frame-by-frame. Once scanned, the image was digitally enhanced from the original prints. I was amazed at the richness and depth of color this process produced. During most parts, these movies look like they could have been filmed last year. Different color pigments are more noticeable, skin color and tone looks more lifelike, and the special effects look sharper. All in all, one couldn't ask for anything more from the picture quality of these versions. I have yet to a scene where I felt it could have been retouched better.

If the image quality isn't enough to make this collection worth buying, the new 5.1 DTS mixes seal the deal. Gone are the days of me fidgeting with volume during every other scene! The balance between dialog, ambient sounds, and score is perfect. I never would have imagined that movies made in the 60's and 70's could sound so good. Unlike the previous DVDs, these Ultimate Edition DVDs utilize my home theater to its maximum potential. Explosions rumble through my sub and the dialog comes clearly through my center channel; every word is audible. I own other DVDs from films made over the last couple of years that wish they could sound this good! Utilizing the DTS is a MUST!

Finally, while I consider myself fairly discriminating when it comes to audio and video clarity, I am by no means an audio or videophile. So, I don't think you need a $25,000 home theater setup to enjoy the enhancements these DVDs offer. I wrote this review based off of the following hardware:

32"" Winbook 720p LCD HDTV

Up-converting Samsung DVD Player (connected via DVI)

Sony 7.1 (7x100w) Surround Receiver

Matching 5.1 MTX Surround Sound Speaker System

Hopefully, this will help clear up some confusion or doubt as to the value this collection offers.",1173830400,11,3582,4.712
2655480,5,B000ICM5VC,"The question to ask yourself is this: are these sets worth the money?

The answer really depends on what kind of fan you are.  These sets seem to be aimed at the fans of the James Bond series as a whole (not toward any specific actor or decade).  If you've never purchased a James Bond DVD before and are a fan of most of the films, this is an easy purchase.

If you already own some or all of the previous releases, does this release necessitate a purchase?  This depends on what you are looking for in a DVD release of this series.  If you are looking for more extras, you may want to think twice.  This new release contains most of the same extras as the original release.  The new extras are nice, but if the most informative stuff (commentaries and documentaries) are exactly the same as the previous release.

If you are looking for upgraded picture and sound quality, then buy these sets now.  The upgrades are extremely impressive, with each film looking like it was filmed yesterday.  The sound improvements aren't quite as impressive, but are still an upgrade to some of the mono tracks for the older films.

What about a HD version coming in the future?  Well that all depends on how what you think the fate of the HD format will be.  If you think it's going to stick around for a good long time, then skip this set and wait for an HD version.  If you think that HD will be the Laserdisc of it's time and will replaced all too quickly by direct downloads to your TV, than go ahead and indulge in this set now.

The packaging is also a plus for collectors.  The slimpack packaging takes up less room and the boxes are fairly attractive.  I'm not too crazy about the new cover art (I wish they had used the old poster art), but it's a minor thing.  The menus are interesting, but I think I enjoyed the old DVD menus more.

With that said, I purchased all four sets.  For the picture and sound upgrade and that fact that I can get all 20 films for a good price makes it an easy purchase.  Sure I have my favorite films of the bunch, but I enjoy the documentaries and commentaries on all the movies.  Besides what makes a ""good"" Bond film is really subjective.

That said... here are my opinions of the films included in Set 4.

Dr. No:

It's difficult to judge the first Bond movie without comparing it to the films that followed it.  The visuals are great, especially the sets by Ken Adam, and the location work in Jamaica.  Some of visual effects are less than spectacular, but they are good for the time.  The music is interesting in that the main James Bond theme is introduced, but overused.  The rest of the score is OK, but lacking the intensity that John Barry would add later.  The real story here is Sean Connery's debut as 007.  He's great in the part and plays it as a real man caught in a dangerous spot.  Ursula Andress makes a very sexy Honey Rider.  Joseph Wiseman makes an excellent villain.  He gives Dr. No a sense of style and cruelty that matches Bond's hero very well.  Director Terrance Young moves things at a slower pace, but keeps the film interesting.  When all is said and done this is a good action adventure film.  Compared to the other Bond films, it might be a little slow or simplistic, but on its own terms its a good evenings entertainment. 3 out of 5 stars.

You Only Live Twice:

The follow-up to ""Thunderball"" was bigger in every way.  Unfortunately, bigger isn't always better.  The sets (especially the volcano base) are awe inspiring.  The location shooting in Japan is exotic and intriguing.  John Barry turns in one of his best scores for the Bond series, mixing the Asian flavor with classic Bond style.  The main theme sung by Nancy Sinatra is one of the best of the 60's.  However things start going a little bad in the acting.  Sean Connery just isn't into the part by this point.  His confidence has shifted into boredom, and while it doesn't match his ultra-relaxed/bored performance in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" its pretty weak.  Luckily Donald Pleasance is suitably creepy as Bloefeld and you've got two sexy Japanese ladies to pick from (Mie Hama and Akiko Wakabayashi).  Also of note is Tetsuro Tamba as Tiger Tanaka, Bond's contact in Japan.  This was director Lewis Gilbert's first Bond film, and it isn't a bad outing.  The script (by Roald Dahl of all people) is weak and over the top.  Lewis makes the best of it, but like many bond films, the movie feels too long.  An entertaining film, but not one of the better ones. 3 out of 5 stars.

Moonraker:

Ah, Moonraker.  Often called the worst Bond film of all time.  Well, that title isn't earned.  Visually this is an excellent film.  More great sets by Ken Adam, and beautiful location shooting in Brazil, Italy and France.  The visual effects are also pretty good for the time.  The main theme is typical, but John Barry's score is very good.  Roger Moore does a solid job playing the role in the same vein as the previous film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".  Lois Chiles is only OK as Holly Goodhead, she comes across a bit flat (but very attractive).  Villain duties are split between Richard Kael (still huge, but less threatening) and Michel Lonsdale as Hugo Drax (urbane and cruel in the Dr. No fashion).  It's the script and the direction that makes this film fall apart.  ""Comedy"" is increased to jokey puns and stupid sight gags.  Roger plays off most of them in his impeccable manner, but that doesn't keep the audience from groaning.  Director Lewis Gilbert gives the film little urgency, and Kael's character is only in the film for laughs instead of thrills.  In fact the movie is pretty thrill-less.  However it has enough good things going for it, to make it entertaining, but really a silly adventure, none the less.  3 out of 5 stars.

Octopussy:

After the wonderful ""For Your Eyes Only"" it was time to return to the old fashioned 007 adventure.  Only if old fashioned means lots of questionable ""comedy"" and a script that needed some more work.  Again, visuals are not a problem, with the film taking place in India and Germany, there's plenty of great location shooting and authentic sets by Peter Lamont.  The movie has some great stunt work as well.  Roger is back in a more comfortable mode as 007.  The hard edge of the previous movie is gone, replaced by an overly confident character.  Moore isn't quite as bored as Connery, but he's going through the motions.  The rest of the cast is OK.  Maud Adams is attractive and alluring as Octopussy, but when the characters calls for anything else she can't quite manage it.  Louis Jourdan is better as Kamal Khan; all smoothness and cruelty.  The rest of the cast ranges from adequate to over the top.  John Glen keeps the pace rolling, and does a great job with the action scenes.  The major failing is the script.  It feels thrown together, and only serves as padding around the action set pieces.  There is a focus on humor, but the jokes are stale, lame, or just plain stupid.  As a result the movie drags from action scene to action scene.  It's not the weakest effort with Roger Moore, but it struggles to keep my interest. 2 out of 5 stars.

Tomorrow Never Dies:

Pierce Brosnan's second outing promised to be a good one.  It had a great cast, and audiences were ready for more James Bond.  Things don't quite fall together.  Bond finds himself in Germany, Vietnam and the China sea.  Location shooting and work on sets blends perfectly.  The visual effects are great, and the stunt work is also good.  David Arnold gives us his first Bond score, and its very good (but relies on the Bond theme a little too heavily).  The theme by k.d. lang is wonderful, but is relegated to the end credits.  Sheryl Crow's theme is lacking something.  Brosnan is even better in this film, and plays the role with confidence.  Michelle Yeoh is also excellent, matching Bond with her skills and creating a believable partner.  Teri Hatcher isn't in the film much, but does a good job.  Jonathan Pryce goes over the top and makes his character humorous instead of threatening.  The script is weak.  Its not very polished and has the feel of action scenes in search of a plot.  Director Roger Spottiswoode makes most of the scenes in the first half work great, but once the action shifts to Asia, the movie derails.  The action scenes are huge and explosive, but seem to go on forever.  There is little threat, only loud explosions.  The result is a movie that starts out great, but fizzles by the end.  2 out of 5 stars.",1173830400,2,8485,4.495406824146982

2655482,5,B000ICM5VC,"The 007 DVD's have been one of the ones I would most like to collect. This masterwork set brings me more joy than just simply having the movies.

Sony, who now owns the repo rights to MGM/UA films, has put together a collection of five Bond films.

In this outing, the fourth of four, we have an eclectic collection of five of the Bond films - ""Dr. No,"" ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Octopussy,"" ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and ""Moonraker.""

All of the older films have been restored with a frame-by-frame precision that is only possible with today's technology. This results in one of the better pictures of any of the previous releases of the Bond films to DVD. They have also had many audio enhancements, upgrading to Dolby 5.1 where possible, that make listening to them a real pleasure.

But it is not the visual presentation, which, btw, is excellent, nor the audio presentation, which is equally excellent, that should make Bond's fans almost quiver with excitement. It is the presentation of one extra disc with =each= movie, all loaded with the usual behind-the-scenes and making of featurettes, that make this collections a must have.

Some of the more recent Bond films, such as ""Die Another Day,"" have had these extras, but this is the first time that all 20 of Bond's films (except the brand new ""Casino Royale"") have had this kind of treatment.

Truly a Bond fans delight. Sony is also releasing a version of each of the restored films individually, although these will not be the dual disc seen in this package, just a single disc with the restored movie. If you are a James Bond fan, you need look no further for a definitive collection.",1171497600,,1642,4.684027777777778
2655483,5,B000ICM5VC,"In honor of the new Bond restart ""Casino Royale"", all the previous Bond movies have been released in four boxed sets in two disc special edition form, with state od the art picture and sound quality and a dazzling array of special features.

For me, this is a dream come true. I've been a James Bond since I was 5 years old. I've idolized the very idea of the man since I was a kid, and now to see him in all incarnations in the way he is meant to be seen is a treat.

Volume Four gives you five Bond films: the film that started all, 1962's timeless ""Dr. No"", the cheesy but enjoyable 1967 Asian adventure ""You Only Live Twice"", 1979's often unfairly bashed sci-fi romp ""Moonraker"", 1983's vastly underrated ""Octopussy"" (one of my all time favorites), and 1997's fun ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".

I'm not going to give plot details of all the movies, but I will say that the picture and sound quality do indeed do live up to expectations. The collectible booklets that come with the dvds are excellent, and while I have not watched any of them yet, I'm sure the extras are excellent. Overall, this is definitely a must have.",1171497600,,1119,4.422330097087379
2655484,5,B000ICM5VC,"You'll note in my other reviews (Bond sets 2 and 3) I am overwhelmed by picture, sound, and extras quality. Other reviewers have said the same thing and with greater depth. These sets are a MUST HAVE for any Bond fan. Especially as the one-off re-releases of each film, for Region 1, lack the extras disc...

I am merely commenting my own opinions on each of the included movies as pithy as humanly possible (well, for me at any rate...). I have bought all 4 sets, the extras alone make the purchases worthwhile (nevermind that phenomenal picture and sound quality!), even if I don't like the movies and I know that with any franchise, there are people who will agree, disagree, and do both for any given person's review.

For the first set to come out, I am surprised by the lacklustre quality of the releases. I shall adumbrate:

""Dr. No"" - A good opener that has dated well because it takes itself seriously.  Sean Connery is the first actor to play Bond and, throughout his tenure, typically does a very good job.  Sometimes I think he comes over as 'wooden', but it's really more 'deadpan' than anything else...  I haven't seen this one in ages, however...  but it is deserving of all the praise it gets.

""You Only Live Twice"" - YOLT does have a nice title song, but that's about it.  It's another campy OTT big villain with ludicrous hangout who wants to control the world like any other cartoon character would.

""Octopussy"" - Surprisingly not bad, though not as stellar as FYEO...  Maud Adams and Sir Roger Moore are a clear match for this movie, which is about  financing a grand operation to dominate the world.  There is some two-dimensional stereotyping (the sheep eyeball eating scene in India), but Bond is all out in this one as, atypically, he goes undercover in disguise.  A clown, ironically, to save the day.  This one has a great punch to it and is a competent piece.  I wish it was Sir Roger's last, as the one he did go out on is incredibly lacklustre.

""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  Call it ""The Nadir Never Dies"" and I'd be happier.  More outright sex jokes (you mean we have to be told he's a ""cunning linguist""?  We haven't fathomed that already?  At least we don't get to see it...  but if things kept going the way they were, no doubt we would have eventually... ugh.)  And the cigarette joke - ""Bond"" kills a guy who's smoking then says ""Smoking is bad for your health"".  Uh, okay...  Bond in the books and in the better films SMOKES.  Why can't the Brosnobond franchise kill itself after this one instead of 6 years later and we'd get the inestimable Daniel Craig put into the role that much more quickly and return the franchise from the F-rated cartoon show it's become!!

And as far as omens go, the people who crafted the 4 Bond set were surely not trying to say something wordlessly??!  As volume 1 had started out with the other grandiose turkey, the final volume (4) ends with the other all-time turkey:  ""Moonraker"".  For this flick, take the sublime 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and its core plot, make it utterly silly and repetitive, put in some people who couldn't act their way out of a mime's booth, throw in some space stations and laser beams for which audience are we thinking about again?, and turn Jaws into Wile E Coyote's stunt double^, and voila:  2 hours of trash.  I know it made money at the time, but just because it's popular doesn't mean it's *good*.

Well, Moonraker isn't that bad.  All it did was make a lie out of ""The Spy Who Loved Me""'s big quote at the end that reads ""James Bond will return in ""For Your Eyes Only""!  Okay, it's worse than bad!!  And yet I'd rather re-watch ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (and I don't...)

^ note:  Wile E Coyote probably stunt doubled for Jaws because anybody kissing Jaws on the lips would need a lot of facial reconstruction surgery...  strangely enough, that didn't happen in this steaming turkey pile either...",1171065600,,3895,4.5337159253945485

DR. NO (1962)

The Bond series got off to a fine start with 1962's ""Dr. No."" Connery WAS Bond from the very first scene in the film. Despite a slow plot, the action sequences and supporting cast (including Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in a breakout performance) make up for it. Overall, this is a fine beginning to one of film's most enduring franchises.

Grade: B+

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967)

This was the first Bond film I remember seeing, and remains my favorite Connery film. Featuring a fantastic plot, terrific action sequences and visual effects, extremely beautiful women, and some of the most exotic locales in the history of the franchise, ""You Only Live Twice"" was Bond at his best in the 1960's. This was Connery's last consecutive film as Bond, and it remains Connery's best!

Grade: A+

MOONRAKER (1979)

Considered by many to be the ""What the F#&!"" of the Bond movies, ""Moonraker"" is better than it's given credit for. However, that does not make it a great film. In an attempt to latch on to the sci-fi bandwagon after ""Star Wars"" blazed a trail for the genre, the film just goes too far ""out there."" A great first half is nearly ruined by a ludicrous climax. Still, Roger Moore still proved he had what it takes to play Bond, and delivers some very funny lines. And the visual effects are truly spectacular. But still, the movie is a wacky film, and Lois Chiles, though very beautiful, sadly lacks any acting talent. Overall, this is definitely one of the five worst Bond films. But the funny part is this: until 1995's ""Goldeneye,"" this remained the most successful of the Bond films.

Grade: C+

OCTOPUSSY (1983)

Roger Moore's next to last Bond film, ""Octopussy"" sadly features an uninteresting plot. Despite Moore's trademark style as Bond, beautiful women, and terrific action sequences, the film lacks a powerful punch, and the main villain is quite dull. Despite good intentions, this one is a disappointment.

Grade: B-

TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997)

The Bond film that shared the same release date as James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is the second Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan, the only actor who I felt didn't have what it takes to play Bond. And like ""Octopussy,"" the film's fantastic action sequences, exotic locales, and beautiful women are let down by an uninteresting plot. Jonathan Price, although a very good actor, is a bit over the top in this film, and the plot of a man's plans to start World War III to achieve ratings for his news network is a bit laughable. Thankfully, Brosnan would actually make two decent Bond movies after his first two disappointments.

Grade: C+

In conclusion, this is a fantastic DVD set. Complete your Bond film collection with the Volume Four of the ""James Bond Ultimate Edition"" DVD set!
