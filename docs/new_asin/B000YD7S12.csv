In the early 1970's, the computer techniques were far less developed.
Even so, the visual quality of this interesting work is unsatisfactory more from the point of view of traditional staging than the filming itself.
The opening Act is fun enough. Three unamed actresses mimed out the three Rhinemaidens, flrting with Alberich.
However, the fun dissipates when the gods come on stage. Thomas Stewart is a vocally capable Wotan, but entirely uncharismatic and fails to convince as the head of the gods. Jeannine Altmeyer and Peter Schreier are all but two of the characters that have some semblance of godliness in them.
The most dramatic part of the story, the trapping of Alberich, is a failure. The easiest trick is to cast a net round the toad, then when the toad becomes a human being, the net enlarges to envelope the whole. In the old 1960's Kung Fu films that I used to watch, this trick was all but too readily and easily employed. As it is, one wonders why Alberich could not simply wriggle out of Loge's flimsy clutch.
Then of course, the props were also disappointing. Gold never looked like gold, and the 'ring' is a clumsy facsimile of a blacksmith's (not goldsmith) leftovers.

3025945,2,B000YD7S12,"Compared to other ""Das Rheingold"" DVD's I have seen, this one is a disappointment. Karajan may have been a superb conductor but his staging of the action was hammy, clumsy, and amateurish.

  Of the singers, the best by far are the Loge of Peter Schreier and the Fricka of Birgitte Fassbaender. Thomas Stewart is stiff, the other gods are lackluster (possibly stifled by Karajan's penchant for total performance control), and the first scene in the Rhine is very stilted and lacks animation.
  Unless you really want to hear Schreier ""play against type"" as a sly yet tuneful Loge, avoid this.

3025946,2,B000YD7S12,"Unitel made a wise decision in the 1970s when after planning, or being encouraged by Karajan, to film a complete Ring, they quit after this Rheingold.

The culprit is largely Karajan. His conducting elicits beautiful playing (as one would expect form the Berlin Philharmonic) and energy but little variety. His tempi are often so fast they skate over the surface of the action. Pacing, the ebbs and flows, the ability to highlight individual moments hardly make their presence. The pulse rarely rises here. Levine, in his Met production - the only other traditional production on DVD - may at times make a meal of the piece (his lumbering entry of the giants has to be heard to be believed) but there is life, drama and the piece mostly takes off, unlike Karajan except in a few moments.

Karajan is also the director here and that, too, is problematic. While the Rheinmaidens can swim around at leisure and look convincing (and fetching), Wotan, Fricka and the Gods may as well have phoned in their acting, there is so little notable movement, drama, nuance and interaction. They look good, and the 1973 recording is excellent and well balanced, but please - this is drama. Thomas Stewart's Wotan sounds noble and Brigitte Fassbaender is in splendorous voice as Fricka, but that doesn't salvage their wooden stage presence.

With a set and production design by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen (the Met's Ring designer, too) those, like myself, who embrace a traditional staging, will find much to enjoy visually. But Schneider-Siemssen's set and designs from the Met are mostly even more compelling. Perhaps with today's technology, a filmed Ring could be stunning, although I almost always prefer a staged performance (some of the few films which rise above the medium to become excellent artistic documents are Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna's Tosca, and Frederic Mitterand's Madama Butterfly with Ying Huang and Richard Troxell.)

Other problems here are with a super-large looking Erda, where in her scenes, astonishingly, the film action stops to stills a couple of times for several seconds. Perhaps it was a mistake by Unitel. At least I hope so. That can't have been the intent. The rainbow, so spectacular in the Met version, is hardly recognizable here. And you can barely see Valhalla, apparently a point of dispute between Karajan and Schneider-Siemssen (Karajan got his way).

There are some good things. Peter Schreier's Loge is full of lieder-like word painting, illuminating probably the most interesting character in the opera. Zoltan Kelemen is a fine, dark Alberich, especially potent in the curse, helping the performance rise above its flatline, pedestrian conducting. The opening scene with Alberich and the Rheinmaidens works very well, the ability of film making the Rhein look particularly fluid and realistic. The hustle and bustle of the Nibilungs is well done.

Ultimately, however, far too much of this Rheingold simply makes little impact and leaves a diluted taste like weak coffee, poor chocolate or old strudel. This rarely lifts off the page or seems like an event.",1209513600,14,3100,5.128712871287129

Several of the characters are played by actors, miming to the singers. This approach is acceptable (I suppose) for minor characters like the Rheinmdchen, much less so when applied to the Giants, but extremely jarring when used for Donner or Erda. Even the main characters seem slightly out of synch, which is a shame.

Star of the show is Peter Schierer - his Loge is superb - closely followed by Brigitte Fassbnder's Fricka. Either performance would justify buying this DVD. To hear both is simply glorious.

In contrast, Thomas Stewart's Wotan is merely adequate; his voice is superb, though lacking emotion, but his acting skills are limited to posing in profile. It gets old very quickly. Let's blame the director.

Freia is a singularly thankless role, but Jeannine Altmeyer played it well, giving us hints of her excellent Sieglinde in Chereau's production.

The production is the traditional pantomime, with giants, dragon and gold. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Technically, the visual side is fine - not too many artifacts, and perfectly acceptable for 1978. The sound is OK, but describing it as DTS 5.1 is pushing the envelope. Yes, there is a synthesised back-channel, giving some computer-generated ambience, but it isn't the same as a stage performance.

Karajan? Now here's where the disappointment lies; of all combinations, Wagner plus Karajan should equal dynamite. Unfortunately, it's all rather staid. Yes, the tempo is a bit faster than Levine's, but there's none of the emotion/bombast/fun (delete where applicable) one would normally associate with Karajan. I wonder why.

8231898,4,B000YD7S12,"Since I intensely dislike regietheater, for me there are only two options for Das Rheingold on DVD, this one and the first Levine Ring set.  Beggars can't be choosers. While the production values aren't perfect, I am reasonably pleased with this version and like it a little better than the Levine set.  The lip-synching doesn't bother me. Frankly, what I really hope for some day is a filmed version that really goes all out and has decent special effects.  On film, I would actually prefer good dramatic actors who lip-synch to music sung by the best singers one can find.  That way one gets to enjoy a believable dramatic production as well as fine singing.  Having said that, it is definitely true that this one is not bad, but still leaves a lot to be desired.  The staging is fairly static and the acting is middling.  However, for all its faults, I will still take this one over Gods on Gilligan's Island or Hooker Rhinemaidens or spacemen in the lab.  And the cast seems as balanced as on most DVDs I've seen.  Karajan and the Berlin PO are of course, terrific and the sound is pretty good for a mid 70s audio track.  Perhaps when people get tired of all the puerile directorial versions designed to ""shock"" the bourgeoisie and show off the superficial philosophical predilections of the latest designer du jour, someone will find a way to produce a filmed Ring with all the dramatic impact of a good HBO series with good looking actors backed by a fine orchestra and the best singers.  In my view, that would be the Solti equivalent innovation for opera on DVD that might actually garner a mass audience.",1399334400,,1613,4.604895104895105
8231899,4,B000YD7S12,"Some reviews are panning this DVD too harshly because it does not have Hollywood quality special effects.  I never saw an opera with fabulous special effects, so don't let these detractors discourage you from ordering this DVD. It's a FUN Rheingold that holds up well over time!  With one exception, the effects are opera quality or better, and the performances are good, so how can you be disappointed?

I saw excerpts of this DVD on  y o u t u b e DOT c o m of the Niebelheim scenes, and that was enough to convince me to buy.  You, too, can go to you tube, and check it out for yourself.  Having seen the DVD, it is pretty much what 'the tube' led me to expect.  The only poor effect is the appearance of Erda, poor even by the quality of effects one expects from a staged opera.  Thus, I had to watch a few seconds of a poor special effect.  Big deal! Four stars and not five.

Warning -- topless Rheinmaidens!  No fuzzy focus here, as an earlier reviewer implied.  Rheinmaidens do not appear topless in the Met DVD.  If you are of a particularly sensitive nature, this fact may be important to you.",1322524800,2,1103,4.296116504854369
8231900,3,B000YD7S12,"This is the recording that SHOULD have been included in the recorded cycle for Karajan.  First of all, there is more consistency in who plays what in the cycle (Stolze is Mime in both Rheingold and Siegried; Stolze is not (thank heavens) Loge (who is wonderfully portrayed by a beautifully voiced and well acted singer, Peter Schreier); a wonderfully voiced and expressive Thomas Stewart as Wotan, the king of the gods (instead of the utterly aesthetically and vocally incomprehensibly cast Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau), Stewart who takes on the roles in the second and third evenings.  In addition, we have Karl Ridderbusch give a much more sensitive, beautiful, and touching portrayal of the love-struck Fasolt (even though he does portray Fafner in Siegfried).  The other singers - particularly Brigitte Fassbender (Fricka who to my ears is better than Josephine Veasy who played it on the LP performance) and Jeannine Altmeyer (Freia) - are really quite good.

As for the interpretation of Karajan, this is truly matter of taste.  My own preference goes to the more traditional styles of Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch, and Krauss (Solti is too hyper-wrought and shrill, particularly in terms of his over the top handling of the brass, for my taste).  Karajan tends to wallow a bit in orchestral sounds, but such beautiful sounds they are.  I would also say that, with the exceptions of utter wrong-headed casting such as Brilioth as the Gotterdammerung Siegfried, Dernesch as the Gotterdammerung Brunhilde, and the inexplicable casting of Gundula Janowitz along side Jon Vickers in Die Walkure (for an idea of how the Walsung pair can sound, try out the Knappertsbusch 1957 Walkure with Birgit Nillson and Ramon Vinay or James King and Regine Crespin with Solti), there are other casting decisions that work (Crespin as Walkure Brunnhilde, Stewart as Wotan/Wandrer, Ridderbusch as Hagen, Zoltan Keleman as a more human (if not more humane) Alberich, and most of all Vickers as Siegmund) that make this an interesting second or third copy (after one of the recordings I mentioned above.  While this will give you great sound (and some good singing); the Furtwangler (Rome), Knappertsbusch (Bayreuth 1956), Krauss (Bayreuth 1953) cycles will give you great Wagner singing AND conducting (and not bad sound).

I have left the staging until last because I think that it is the most problematic.  The singers in the film a) weren't always the same people who sang in the sound track) and b) they were required to lipsynch with the soundtrack.  In this some did better than others.  Stewart did well until towards the end and Donner was often embarrassingly off.  Even Schreier was completely deadpan in his final aside (""Zu Ihrem enden eilet Sie zu"") about thinking that he might eventually end up destroying the gods.  The dragon in the third scene looked like it had escaped from Sesame Street.  While it SHOULD make Wotan laugh, it's out of the high artistic aesthetic standard that I would assume that Karajan wanted to maintain.

One final point: the scene between Erda and Wotan is very strangely handled with Wotan being in a frozen position while Erda sings, clearly indicating that it was taped separately.  I'm sure they could have done better.

My solution to this problem has been to burn the sound track of this video to CD and then, when I wish to hear the Karajan Ring, I listen to this dubbing rather than the one I bought on LP many years ago.  For me that works.",1281916800,6,3474,4.9689119170984455
8231901,4,B000YD7S12,"Since Das Rheingold is based on Norse mythology, it's full of magic and monsters and many things that are terribly difficult to stage well.  Other DVD versions are well sung, well acted, but the really exciting thing about this film is... just THAT -- it's not staged*; it's a film done to a previously recorded sound track.  I was hoping and expecting to FINALLY see some of the staging problems solved with cinematic special effects.  How great!!! -- finally we get to see Rhinemaidens really swimming in the depths of the Rhine, giants who tower above the other characters, Alberich disappear and change into a giant serpent (or dragon?), the gods walk across the rainbow to Valhalla, etc. etc.  A few of those effects were done well, others not very well, and curiously some not even tried!
[* some scenes were filmed on what looks like a theater stage]

Scene 1 (in the Rhine): starts by hovering above a real river bounded by cliffs -- beautiful and very promising.  Then we're transported to the bottom and see the Rhinemaidens obviously suspended on wires, looking like they're filmed through a glass of water.  It's been done much better in live performance.  They do start to get it right when the Rhinegold lights up with the rising sun; the illusion becomes very strong at that point. (BTW, how nice to see the Rhinegold look magical, not just a lump of fake rock with gold paint.)

In scene 2 (a hilltop with Valhalla in the background): Valhalla looked OK -- more like Superman's ice-palace than a stone fortress.  But the foreground was ugly (Valhalla must have had an awful view.)  Most of the characters acted well enough -- the lip-synching was good.  Freia (Jeanine Altmeyer) was stunning both physically and vocally.  However, Fricka (although beautifully sung by Brigitte Fassbaender) looked ridiculous -- eyes vacantly staring and expressionless most of the time.  She's supposed to be one of the more tempestuous characters.  Wotan (Thomas Stewart) and Loge (Peter Schreier) were both superb; unique interpretations very much worth hearing.

As for the giants -- high marks for wild hair and make-up.  At first the issue of their height was handled by always shooting them separately from the other characters, until they grab ahold of Freia (who was their promised payment for building Valhalla.)  At that point, it's obvious that they're about 6'6"" and not 20 feet tall.  How did they ever manage to build that ice-palace??

Scene 3: Alberich, the villain who steals the gold (the Wagner counterpart to Tolkien's Lord Sauron, though he resembles Gollum more) has forged the ring and forced his brother Mime (possibly the worst make-up job in the history of opera) to make him the Tarn-helm.  With it he can disappear (and he does -- Bravo to that) but the serpent he turns into is a one-eyed escapee from a low-budget horror movie.  It makes you wonder why some of the effects were SO awful.

As stated in previous reviews, in Scene 4, the rainbow bridge to Valhalla is barely visible.  And so on ....

I've gone into so much detail about these effects because 1. That was my main reason for watching this particular DVD, having seen many others (Rheingold is a favorite of mine) and 2. Other reviewers have already discussed just about everything else.  I would only like to add that the Berlin Philharmonic under Maestro von Karajan sounds unbelievably beautiful, and that I thought all of the singers were very-good to wonderful, with the exception of the 2nd Rhine maiden (Edda Moser) whose too-fast vibrato was annoying.

So there you have it.  The film dates back to the early 70's (not THAT old); I expected more.  The best parts:  the Berlin Phil, the fine singing, especially of Stewart (Wotan), Schreier (Loge) and Altmeyer (Friea) -- contrary to some other reviewers I felt those 3 in particular stood out -- and some of the visuals.",1251504000,4,3869,4.835866261398176
8231902,5,B000YD7S12,"Karajan is still a polarizing figure. This item, one of the earliest tries at filming a Wagner opera, has earned wildly mixed notices: ""They don't get any better than this,"" exults one reviewer. ""Best left at the bottom of the Rhine,"" sneers another. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between.

The positives first. Orchestrally and vocally this is an unsurpassed RHEINGOLD. Karajan's 1968 DG recording is often acclaimed for its color and fantasy, but it features three pieces of much-criticized casting: Fischer-Dieskau's underpowered Wotan, Manglesdorff's squally Freia, and Stolze's rasping character tenor as Loge. This DVD replaces them with Stewart, Altmeyer, and Schreier, all distinct improvements. The enclosed booklet claims that the film's soundtrack was recorded in Salzburg's Grosses Festspielhaus during the 1973 Easter Festival. But it wasn't taped during a performance or even a dress run: there are no audience noises, no stage thumpings, and the singers don't budge from their microphones. Just like the earlier DG set, this is clearly a studio effort -- and since its producer and head engineer are the same individuals who generated Karajan's EMI opera recordings, one wonders if the UK firm considered releasing it audio-only.

In any case Stewart is in bronzen voice here, a little tight at the bottom but boasting top notes that soar over the orchestra with an exciting spin and gleam -- he makes the best recorded case for a dramatic baritone rather than a high bass in this role, and he etches the text with imagination: his Wotan is imperious, temperamental, smugly amused, and in the end deeply shaken by Fasolt's murder. With her full lyric soprano, Altmeyer is the most sumptuous of Freias, and Schreier's supple Mozart tenor provides a fresher, more mellifluous Loge than it would for Janowski in Dresden. Otherwise Salzburg's Fassbaender, Roar, and Finnila (Fricka, Donner, and Erda) are just as adept as the earlier Veasey, Kerns, and Dominguez -- Karajan being Karajan, he normally could get the best available. The Berlin PO, needless to say, is stupendous in both 1968 and 1973; as for the recorded sound, the anvil rapping in Nibelheim is cleaner in the former, the giants' entrance music better balanced in the latter. 1973 trumps 1968 by dint of improved casting: there has never been a more gorgeously sung or grippingly paced RHEINGOLD, and on that basis alone this DVD is worth your attention.

Now the visuals. Notwithstanding contributions from members of the original design team, this isn't a document of Karajan's Salzburg production. It was shot in a Munich film studio 5 years later -- simply a lip-synched, ad hoc staging of a preexisting recording. Yet, despite the all-purpose critical sneering that Karajan's name sometimes evokes, this video RHEINGOLD is no worse -- and sometimes far better -- than the several Italian operas (LUCIA, PAGLIACCI, TOSCA, etc.) that had previously been put on film in the same way.

Sets here are similar in style but vastly different in layout from the Easter Festival designs. Scene 1 is a representational look at the Rhine's underwater depths: aquamarine color scheme, blurry views (vasoline over the lens?) and waves undulating past. Flown from invisible wires, topless rhinemaidens wear diaphanous houri pants; Alberich is a wide-eyed yokel who takes a nasty fall down the rhinegold's pyramidal throne. Sure, it's clunky at times, yet the action is clearer and better attuned to the lines than in any other video of the piece. Scene 3, Nibelheim, smacks of the crystal cavern in JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (1959). In Scenes 2 & 4, the realm of the gods is a lava field; back-projected on a cycloramic sky, Valhalla seems hewn out of the mountainside itself.

As for the overall cinematic effect, don't think Hollywood. Think documentary, think educational TV, think earlier BBC with THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (1981) or Tom Baker's HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (1982). This RHEINGOLD is often fun, but it never approaches big-budget filmmaking. (Nor, in fairness, do 90% of today's opera videos.) Onscreen, Stewart's Wotan looks regal and Zeus-like but frequently has to stand around with little to do -- Karajan's directorial habit is to plant the gods in statuesque tableaux as if they were at an ambassadorial reception. Only Schreier's Loge gets to gad about and lounge on the lava rocks.

But the blocking and camerawork (5-man team) improve as the show goes along. Intense close-ups track Alberich's shift from dimwit to despot: blessed with both a fine voice and a fascinating character face, Kelemen is riveting in his Scene 3 menaces and Scene 4 malediction. True, some of the special effects are cheesy: a drab, sagging rainbow, dry ice for the gods growing old, Erda's disembodied face bleeding through a still photo, even more dry ice for Donner's storm. But there are a fair number of shrewd, evocative touches: sinister highlights repeatedly glinting on the ring; the tarnhelm's various vanishing acts, going more smoothly than on any stage; a vivid descent to Nibelheim through unfurling geologic strata, with glimpses of Nibelungs at work and looking like genuine dwarves; a dragon that's an authentic hoot (as it should be -- after all, Wotan laughs at it); and finally Fasolt's murder: a brutal collage of slashing blows and gasping faces that's legitimately shocking. Despite his jack-of-all-trades imperfections, Karajan is the only recent director to honestly grapple with the effects described in RHEINGOLD's lines and stage directions.

English subtitles are from the reader-friendly modern translation by Stewart Spencer (ISBN 0500281947). Warts and all, this is an intriguing production that easily holds its own with the filmed operas of that era. What's more, it showcases the leading Wagner singers of its generation, one of the greatest orchestras in the galaxy, and a conductor who -- love him or hate him -- definitely knew how to make this music work. In short, this is much more engrossing than some would have you believe. Us American operagoers don't get many cracks at a ""live"" RHEINGOLD, so we don't mind a production that follows the script.",1242432000,15,6190,5.147117296222664
8231903,5,B000YD7S12,"Herbert von Karajan's Salzburg RING series is justly famous. The intent was to film the entire Ring, but unfortunately only DAS RHEINGOLD was committed to film. It is in all respects excellent. Peter Schreier is one of the finest Loge's around, and Thomas Stewart's Wotan is commanding and majestic. This performance holds up very well against more modern competition. Highly recommended.",1238371200,2,388,5.377049180327869
8231904,2,B000YD7S12,"I am confused as to the genesis of this production, as presented here.

It is implied Unitel filmed ""Rheingold"" but then, for whatever reasons, abandoned their Ring project, never filming the other three Ring operas.  This is problematic.  Karajan did not stage his ring cycle chronologically.  One per season at Salzburg, up first was ""Walkure"", followed by ""Rheingold"", ""Siegfried"" and, finally, ""Gotterdammerung"".  Therefore, if the theory that Unitel started to film Karajan's Ring Cycle, but decided to abandon it in mid cycle, they would already have filmed ""Walkure"" the preceding season. It would have made no sense to skip ""Walkure"" and start with ""Rheingold"", forever dooming themselves to, at best, a 3/4 Ring Cycle.

I also recall that at about the same time DGG's famous audio recordings of Karajan's Ring were being released, there was, on a German label I can't remember the name of now, a release of what was said to be the soundtrack from the filmed stage versions of the operas, with casts that varied slightly from that of the DGG recordings.  It is well known the DGG recordings were all made prior to the actual stage performances, hence the cast variations.  I once saw the set complete at Tower Records in Hollywood, on vinyl, but at a completely unaffordable price.  I clearly remember it saying it was the soundtrack from the Salzburg stage performances.  It was not, in any way, a pirate recording.

Therefore, it is my contention this DVD set is neither Karajan's original Salzburg performance, nor even the only remnant of his cycle that exists.  That leads me to wonder what ever happened to that filmed production.  One must remember that filmed opera in Europe was (and may still be, for all I know) popular and often shown in movie houses.

At least for me, the mystery of Karajan's filmed Ring Cycle remains unsolved.",1213056000,5,1850,4.925806451612903
8231905,4,B000YD7S12,"Herbert von Karajan's studio film of his Salzburg Festival production was lambasted by critics and flopped at the box-office which resulted in Unitel cancelling the filming of the rest of the cycle, a project they were not enthusiastic about to begin with anyway, having to contend with spiralling costs and Karajan's ego, but the loss is truly all ours. Studio-bound though it is, this is nonetheless a great 'Rheingold', thrilling conducted and sung (even better than Karajan's 1968 audio recording in fact!) and a valuable record of the production itself.

If it looks similar to the Met Opera production also available on DVD, this is because it was co-designed by the Gunther-Schneider Siemssen who directed the Met's production, but with Karajan's input this is the version to see rather than the stodgy, uninspired museum piece seen in New York. Thomas Stewart's Wotan and Peter Schreier's Loge dominate the work throughout. Indeed Schreier is barely recognisable, with his shaved head and red outfit, capturing Loge's wily mannerisms and cunning to perfection, it's a powerhouse performance. Stewart too is on excellent form as Wotan, even if Karajan (who also directed the film incidetally) too often cuts to reaction shots - the fact that Stewart can muster quite a variety of reactions in close-up to the various events depicted is truly a testament to his acting ability as well as his singing! In smaller roles, Brigitte Fassbender is an acceptable if unmemorable Fricka and Jeanine Altmeyer a stunning Freya, beautfiul to look at and singing with the right touch of terror and sympathy when confronted by the lumberig giants. Matha Modl appears (but does not sing) as Erda in the film's only weak spot; a crucial moment in the story which doesn't quite come off, added to the fact the ghostly appearence of Erda has clearly been superimposed over a still photo of Wotan and the rest of the Gods! Indeed the special effects themselves look more like something from a Doctor Who episode of the seventies, but are good enough and achieve their purpose without looking too clumsy.

Overall, perhaps the best Rhinegold on DVD and certainly the closest to Wagner's conception of the work without coming across as too reactionary or insipid. Karajan's mastery of staging and conducting is seen here at it's best.",1210636800,16,2319,5.052219321148825
