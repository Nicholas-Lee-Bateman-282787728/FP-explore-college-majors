8602785,1,B00E90359K,"The movie is outstanding but I watched it once after setting the correct region and I can't get it to play again. I get a pop up box that tells me that the movie is in zone 1 (the correct zone) and would I like to change it but if I hit cancel, ore just close the box or even try to reset the zone, it will not let me and the disc automatically ejects. So, I spent over 20 bucks to rent a movie for one viewing.",1517616000,,411,3.6818181818181817

8602791,5,B00E90359K,"Great music and great acting by all.  Although, considered by most to be only a movie, and made primarily for entertainment only, I also consider it to be valuable documentary.  Why?  Because it preserves the historical contribution of Jerry Lee Lewis to music, and especially to Rock and Roll.  Elvis was great but I have always thought Jerry Lee Lewis was the King, just my personal opinion.",1465689600,2,393,4.82089552238806
