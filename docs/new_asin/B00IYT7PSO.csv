8646583,5,B00IYT7PSO,"These TV shows from yesteryear are tough to review. If you grew up watching them you'll love 'em. These remastered discs look great too. Gene Barry played the coolest western hero behind Bret Maverick(James Garner). Number 2 ain't bad. These are the most reasonably priced sets of all the old TV westerns. Maverick, Have Gun Will Travel, and Rawhide are great, but suffer from some rather high prices(usually in the later sets or volumes(aarrrgh)). I would like to get some of these later seasons but the costs are driving me to find better values in Bat Masterson. Some of the other Bat sets for sale are ridiculously cheap. I like to get more Rawhide episodes but those prices are stratospheric and involve volumes(we all hate that).

I purchased the first two seasons of Bat M. and really enjoyed them. The plots are fun. He's fast with his fancy handmade snubby gun and even faster to whack baddies with his hefty cane, ouch! The prices were so reasonable for the remastered sets, I paid a little more and went that-a-away. Just like the Maverick episodes, the women in Bat Masterson were the hotties of the day, from Playboy pin ups to budding stars like Diane Cannon in some of her first work on screen. One thing I noticed right away, the bad guys were the REAL bad guys, guys that were good at playing rustlers, card cheats, crooked sheriffs, greedy land barons, evil gun fighters, etal.. Bat takes them all down with a smile, and maybe an occasional sneer.

My three faves are Maverick, Bat M., and Have Gun Will Travel(in order). These hombres are so confident, they just wander into danger casually and slip out the other side a winner every time. Try Bat Masterson. I really think it holds up well even in today's quick cut plots. You have half hour episodes just like HGWT that get you in fast and finish quicker. A nice 30 minutes of entertainment with nearly forty episodes per set!! That's value.",1429833600,,1912,4.653846153846154
