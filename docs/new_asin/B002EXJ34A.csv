Well, you could start by saying that. Avian (I don't know how he spells his name or what he is!) lives in an apartment in the U.K and keeps his dead mother in the cupboard, keeps some guy from the British Big Brother in his closet and his best friend is a ... well, we don't know what he is. Avon seeks out celebrities for interviews and then as already mentioned, shows off his perverted insane manner. Avivon also has other characters in the series; probably the most popular is The Bear; a small bear up a tree who invites celebrities to his tree house to read him a story and have a chat... but he always seems to spring a boner and embarrass himself. There is also a lot of other characters, but the most reoccurring ones are Craig David who has a problem with wetting the bed and has to carry a p%$$ bag around with him - Michael Jackson; who in the first series is a reality TV star who is a bad arse, invincible, mo'fo that lives next door to the Osbourne's who are filming their reality show. In season 3 Michael becomes part of doing ""Porridge"" in a reality based version of the classic show with Ronnie Barker. And then there is Mel-B of the Spice Girls who is a full on lesbian and everyone around her is a ""bowstad"".

Many other characters are parodied by this guy, whatever his real name is. If you liked the Ali-G show or Little Britain, you may get a kick out of Bo' Selecta and it's 3 seasons. Personally I think the ball was dropped a bit in the 3rd season, but it does have it's moments oh hilarity.
