Ali's talent as a quick witted persona is displayed as much as his poweress in the ring--both displayed well in Ali Rap.  I'd like to recommend this especially for young people who start like off behind an 8 ball.  Those who didn't know the glory of The Greatest need to.  I'm yet honored to have lived during a time that I watch him happen--first in the ring and then in the world.  He got a message through about being black, being human well being Ali that meant as much as any speech maker in history and reached those who needed it the most.",1168300800,7,617,4.230769230769231

8142840,5,B000I0RNWA,THE RAPPER OF TODAY NEED TO SEE AND HEAR HOW IT IS DONE BY THE FIRST HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF RAP. HE IS SO SMOOTH  THE  WAY HE CAN MAKE THE WORDS FLOW OUT OF HIS MOUTH LIKE WATER OUT OF A CUP. THEN HE COULD MAKE UP A RHYME WITH FOUR WORDS LIKE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE. ALI IS THE CHAMP OF RAP HANDS DOWN NO ONE IS AS FAST WITH WORDS AS HE IS.,1361750400,,339,3.506666666666667
8142841,4,B000I0RNWA,"I bought this dvd because im a huge fan of boxing! One of the highlights of this dvd for me is the bonus features that include Ali's fight against George Foreman. What a great fight that pits two of the greatest heavyweights of all time against each other. This fight is really mind over matter for both men. Ali took alot of abuse from one of the hardest punchers the ring has ever known to come out on top. Now on to the movie, Alot of highlight clips to Ali's storied career plus all his funny banter and poetry. Just a good entertaining sports show!",1343952000,2,553,4.276190476190476
8142842,4,B000I0RNWA,"This one is fun! But it is also heartwarming at times.
My favorite moments:
1) Ali's playful and even sweet banter with Howard Cosell.
2) Ali's respectful words of tribute for Joe Frazier.
3) Ali defends true Islam during the days of 9/11
4) Sidney Poitier's recitation of Ali's response to those who accuse African-Americans of hating European-Americans.
Enjoy the rap.  Enjoy the famous faces.  Enjoy the full-presentation of ""The Rumble in the Jungle"". But consider the mind and soul behind these various statements, poems, and conversations.  Ali: maybe the greatest, but certainly the most entertaining.",1338854400,,608,5.3125

8142845,5,B000I0RNWA,"Ali's words float like a butterfly in this wonderful novel.  If you admired Ali and his poetic style, this wonderful book is for you.  Half of the book is pictures with corresponding Ali quotes on the opposite pages.

A fun read for anyone interested in Ali or his words.",1171670400,,271,4.489795918367347
8142846,5,B000I0RNWA,"Ali Rap is an awesome display of the mental side of Ali.  He used rap and rhymes to put together CLASSIC interviews with various people, most notably, Howard Cossell.  He had so much fun giving interviews and showing off in front of the camera, only to back up EXACTLY what he said, in the ring.  I think that this video is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I was entertained by it!!",1169510400,,393,4.27027027027027
