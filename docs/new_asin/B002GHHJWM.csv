3924711,4,B002GHHJWM,"It's difficult to assume that this will be the first Patton Oswalt comedy CD/DVD being picked up by a lot of people, but it's probably true.  Following his starring roles in Ratatouille and the upcoming Big Fan, as well as his well-known role on The King of Queens and his Comedians of Comedy tour, Patton may be at the peak of his fame.  That being said, this album will be picked up by more people, which means that it would assumedly be his best work.

Close, but not quite.  Most would agree that 2007's Werewolves and Lollipops was as good as it got from Mr. Chucklestein, but this Comedy Central Special still features a lot of laughs and some great video content.  Patton has a dearth of new experiences as he is awaiting the birth of his daughter Alice, (apparently his wife's X-Men ploy worked,) and the included CD will give you a couple of bits that didn't make it onto the Special.  On the whole, I really enjoyed ""Obama"" (We only need go back 10 years to blow the past's mind,) ""Sky Cake"" (How the eternal reward of pastries shaped civilization,) and his amazing story of the sadness of Magic Comedy that ends the piece.

The bonus features are a great nod to those who live in Patton's world, (if you don't know who Tommy Wiseau is before you purchase the DVD, look him up real quick...) and the slideshow that is featured at the end references a former item on his website (now gone) in which a guy turned each of the previous Oswalt albums into a birthday party for his friend, making Patton's pop culture references physical gifts.  Kind of strange without the context, but there y'go!

All in all, you won't go wrong purchasing this DVD, especially with the value of the added CD.  Just make sure that you're able to pick up his other work as well.",1252454400,,1766,4.456521739130435
3924712,5,B002GHHJWM,"I showed this dvd to a group of friends after dinner one night. Most of them had never heard of Patton Oswalt. They laughed so hard, when the dvd was over, they went online to look up video clips for more Patton. If you like David Cross, story telling comedy, and raw humor, you'll love this dvd.  You'll also enjoy PATTON OSWALT: NO REASON TO COMPLAIN and PATTON OSWALT: WEREWOLVES AND LOLLIPOPS.  Also check out SARAH SILVERMAN: JESUS IS MAGIC.",1252022400,,446,4.5625
3924713,3,B002GHHJWM,"Patton is known for deriding the stale droves of comics that overpopulated the late-80s/early-90s but when he went into his bit on the rigors of flying I thought I was watching Stand-Up Spotlight with Rosie O'Donnell. Seriously? Flying an airplane is annoying? I think I've heard this bit a millions times. Also, his references to depression, drugs and drinking make this an awkward set: He may be laughing at it but I just feel sorry for him in a way. The references to domestic life dull his edge as well. Most of all, the ""Bush bad/Obama good"" stuff is kinda played.

It seems like instead of being Patton Oswalt he's just doing what it takes to be Patton Oswalt, i.e. making a joke and then sprinkling some reference to Tom Waits or whatever other indie musician to make the ""alternative comedy"" connection. It's like he's finally realized how to hit his mark, with his delivery becoming less slick and more like a formula. Maybe it's because this set was done in a theatre for Comedy Central rather than at places like the 40 Watt that it feels so out of place from his regular stuff. I had been watching his new sets from the Purple Onion and Amoeba and heard the Frankensteins & Gumdrops EP and was getting really excited because I was expecting all of that awesome material to be on his next album, especially the bit about Daniel Plainview being a phone sex operator. Except for the Family Crest bit NONE OF IT MADE IT TO THIS SET!

After David Cross became the worst comedian ever with his constant arrogant whining Patton Oswalt was a breath of fresh air, bereft of all the preachy posturing. His impish self-deprecation and perverse witticisms knew no bounds. Now his set is becoming a self-loathing hatefest filled with creepy anxiety and banality. At least we have Feelin' Kinda Patton and Werewolves & Lollipops.

Fare thee well, sailor! Sail the sea of fame, but come home soon!",1251590400,9,1894,4.664670658682635
3924714,5,B002GHHJWM,"I love comedy albums/performances, and yet it's rare that a comic can come up with 60+ minutes of truly prime material every six months, or a even a year or more. Patton Oswalt (Ratatouille, Big Fan) is operating on a rare level these days, and this show from Washington, D.C. in 2009 displays him at a career peak; he kills with every joke and story, managing to blend fannish/nerdish obsessiveness with the American, everyday humdrummery. In my book, the late George Carlin remains the standup Gold Standard, David Cross's vitriol is sidesplitting and utterly essential, and Henry Rollins's ease at humorous storytelling makes him always worth seeing, but Oswalt is firmly in their company -- he creates albums that bear repeat listens, and have provided me and my friends with fits of laughter. LOLLIPOPS and FEELIN' both had their moments, but this is Oswalt at his most consistent.",1251504000,,886,4.993243243243243
3924715,4,B002GHHJWM,"I'm a fan so I had pre-ordered this DVD, not realizing the special would be on TV. So, I felt sort of consumer duped at first. However, the DVD/CDs have bits that weren't on the Comedy Central airing so yea! me.

I've been a comedy fan since the 70's so I'm old and I know what I like/don't like. I have come to find that when my beloved favorite comedians find love/children, their acts circle the drain. I don't begrudge them happiness as people but it really screws with the funny.

This special is far more into the love/children/personal demons area than I like. Oswalt tries to snark it up but it doesn't always work. Far too often I found myself saying ""oh, gee...Patton is depressed?...."" or ""really, he took acid?..."" and hurting for him rather than finding the follow up humor funny. He's a winsome guy, painfully bright and I missed the balls-to-the-wall bitter insight.

That being said, second rate Patton is better than anything else out there right now. If he toured the midwest I'd drive many hundreds of miles to see a show. I appreciate that he makes so much of his work available. And I'm a completist so it is worth it to me to have it ALL.

Oswalt is a master of wordplay and I can't hear things like ""a sheetcake of victory"" enough. There were a lot of laughs on this DVD. I hope he can wrest himself out of the domesticity issues to tease apart his act from his home life in the future. I need my Patton a little sharper edged.

The extras are pretty funny and Patton clearly has friends who will do anything for him (Jon Hamm!)",1251417600,7,1551,4.390243902439025
3924716,3,B002GHHJWM,"i love the fact that patton usually releases a combo dvd/cd for most of his albums the bang for your buck is far and away better than what you'll get from many other comedians. and i have to say i'm a HUGE fan of patton oswalt, werewolves and lolipops made me laugh so hard i had to pull my car over one day.

but this... this is just ok, a couple of really great laughs but it's such a change from the side splitting almost painfully funny albums he's released before i have to admit i'm kind of disapointed. now i'm still a huge fan and patton is one of the funniest comedians out there.

but this was a big production and when the camera panned the audience it was a huge theator. most of his recorded material i've heard so far were done like in a bar or a small comedy club. i think this may have just been patton out of his element, i'd still recomend it because i can't bring myself to tell someone not to get a patton oswalt album but his earlier cd's are alot funnier in my opinion.",1251417600,11,991,4.103092783505154
3924717,5,B002GHHJWM,"I will revise this review if necessary when the DVD ships, however, I doubt I will need to.  This performance was filmed in Washington DC, and I had the great great pleasure of seeing it live.  My friends are excited to see the Comedy Central airing, but honestly, the DVD should be the only way to watch it.  Patton's act makes use of immense amounts of swearing, and many many situations that would probably be inappropriate for CC to air.  Not to mention that they will have to cut it down to around 1/2 of his performance, so they can add commercials.

I am so excited to be able to revisit this show when the DVD comes out.  Specificially for 3 bits: the Hollywood Hills orgy house, depressed Patton in Mad Max (circus peanuts!!), and the rat on the power line.

Also, the price for this is surprisingly low!  I might just buy extra copies for friends :)",1251331200,,859,4.3924050632911396
3924718,5,B002GHHJWM,"Big fan of anything Patton does. Love his acting, humor, dark humor, family humor, would watch again.  I've watched it a few times now.",1361836800,,135,4.625
3924719,5,B002GHHJWM,"Patton Oswalt is an amazingly funny man. If you enjoy adult humor, comedy about life in general, or just enjoy strange voices, this is an awesome addition to your collection. He uses plenty of profanity, so please be warned if you have small children.",1356912000,,251,4.7272727272727275
3924720,5,B002GHHJWM,"in my opinion his best special so far,,rewaTched 5+ times!!absolutely a vvvvvvvvery unique komik.also chekk out  his newer special,you won't be disappointed.",1352419200,,157,6.136363636363637
3924721,5,B002GHHJWM,"I got a big kick in the groin when I ordered this and a week later Comedy Central was playing a video version of this. It's still hilarious and worth buying. Patton Oswalt has an unusual style of comedy where he thinks up weird random supernatural stuff to go along with his normal life, but makes it funny.",1341878400,,307,4.310344827586207
3924722,5,B002GHHJWM,"Are you a geek, nerd, gamer, comic lover?  Do you enjoy well thought out sarcasm?  If you do/are then sit down shut up and slap your gf/bf in the face and get ready for some funny!  This cd/dvd combo for Patton lovers is perfect.  Patton's style of humor is very sarcastic and smart.  He is an English major who even corrects himself on stage which is funny.  He talk about everything from introducing the fact that he is about to become a father to looking for a new house and stumbling across an orgy.  His bit about different robots is hands down hilarious.  If you like the comic styles of Louis C.K. or David Cross or even Sara Silverman then you will love Patton Oswalt.  And remember  ""I wanna be a checkout clerk"".",1318723200,,722,4.360902255639098
3924723,5,B002GHHJWM,"I think Patton Oswalt is one of the best comics working today. Not just the basic material, but his sense of timing is excellent. This DVD contains some of his best stand-up routines. There are some good extras as well.

If you want to laugh, but this DVD.",1281312000,,256,4.333333333333333
3924724,4,B002GHHJWM,"ANY Patton Oswalt release is a good one.  Enough said there.  But ""My Weakness is Strong"" is very inconsistent.  It has its moments (""Sky Cake"" in particular) but overall it has uneven pacing and the material isn't as strong as his earlier material ""Werewolves and Lollipops"" and ""Feelin' Kinda Patton"".

Worth seeing or listening to, but not a slam-dunk purchase.",1277164800,2,364,5.016666666666667
3924725,5,B002GHHJWM,I bought this as a present for a friend of mine that recently moved to Australia. He for some reason cant get this nice dvd/cd combo and pleaded with me to send it. I ordered and shipped to him. He says its hilarious and gives it all strong marks. Of course he would....its Patton Oswalt.,1255478400,,288,4.254545454545455
3924726,4,B002GHHJWM,"I don't think  it's up to par with Werewolves and Lollipops, but it's new material and is definitely worth the purchase.
I think the biggest thing that brings it down from his last record is he talks about his wife and kid on this one. Sorry, I just don't wanna hear about it. It really should be taboo to mention your wife, kids, or dog on a comedy record. Something really lame/hacky/easy/unoriginal about it.",1253923200,3,411,4.554054054054054
3924727,5,B002GHHJWM,"Patton Oswalt really hit's this special out of the park. The story's flow together, and as a comedian he's really evolved based on the things that happen to him and our culture. Though, when you go back and watch ""No reason to complain"" he talks about hating children, and now he's having one. Patton's comedy remains fresh, topical, and all at the same time, timeless, his specials are re-watchable over and over again. Put this in your DVD player, invite people over, and show this to all of your friends. There's nothing better than a master of comedy.

It would have been nice if the CD was different audio from the DVD, but the set seems to be identical. The DVD has 2 interesting extras but not a lot of content outside the standup. Also it would have been interesting for him to bundle in something for people who wanted to see his new ""Big Fan"" movie. Over all, legendary comedy cd and dvd, a definite add to any collection. 5 out of 5 despite the small gripes",1253750400,,968,4.438202247191011

8369723,4,B002GHHJWM,"Pretty good stuff.  Intellectual humor with scientific highlights mixed in with pop culture.  This is Patton Oswalt material, and he and it are pretty funny.  It was welcome to see someone other than the usual suspects take jabs at religion and the hypocrisy of the such.  His routine skews progressive, which might raise the hackles of some fo the mor conservative secular comedian fans, but it's harmless stuff, and unlike a lot of comedic routines from other standup acts, you don't have to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs to enjoy his show and laugh at his humor.

Check it out.",1520726400,,593,4.718446601941747

8369726,4,B002GHHJWM,"Patton Oswalt is just one of those guys. He's unlikely looking. He's short, chubby and not particularly good looking but he makes all that work wildly in his favor.

Here's the scoop. Oswalt produces this stand-up routine in Washington D.C. in 2008. Like all good comedians he comes out and runs through all manner of stuff from personal matters and circumstance and how these things weave throughout his life and ours. From self checkout in the grocery store to unbearable plane flights he covers a wide range of topics.

This takes a few minutes to get going but it's not unlike a Major League pitcher winding up. When he gets there and hits his stride things start to happen. He's a funny guy. He touches on much of what we all have experienced and plays these things over the top. Surprisingly, he alludes to the fact he's not a really happy guy who is on depression meds. I couldn't help but think of the late Robin Williams. But Patton works it well and manages some great turns of phrase. As someone once said. Comics say funny things and comedians say things funny. That is apparent in spades here. He just has a great way of saying things are are with us every day.

I like seeing stand-up routines. It helps take my mind off the garbage I have to (we all have to) put up with every day. If you're into this sort of thing, you could do much worse.",1415923200,,1356,4.416
