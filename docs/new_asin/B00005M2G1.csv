You can believe me they are not any different than the japanese versions, except the language of course.  Excitement to the very end as always!!!",997142400,,300,4.622641509433962
1624242,2,B00005M2G1,"These episodes might be good dubbed,  but the whole majin buu saga has the best episodes of DBZ.  The whole DBZ saga is greater in japanese and since these are the best episodes you should watch it uncut in japanese,  and that uncut sticker on the tape doesn't mean anything.",996105600,2,275,4.46

1624296,5,B00005M2G1,"One word would explain this DVD...WOW.
If you loved the first confrontation between the Prince of the Saiyans and Goku, then your in for a real treat, because this time Vegeta is more ruthless, the action is more intense, There are more innocents killed, and to top it all off The Fate Of the Universe is at stake...again.
Not Only is the battle between the last 2 surving saiyans going on, but there is a more powerful Evil being fed the energy that is being let off by their fight...Majin Buu.
Is Vegeta's Pride more important than the survival of the universe...?  Find out.",1006387200,2,577,4.548076923076923
1624297,5,B00005M2G1,"So, no matter what you prefer, English or Japanese, you can always watch your favorite DBZ episodes in the format you want. It's especially good for friends who are too lazy to read and just want to watch it in English. Anyways, finally, we get to the heart of this dvd. The Super Saiyajin fight between Goku and Vegeta. Now, Vegeta's always been my favorite DBZ character next to Trunks but I've never really seen these episodes ina  format I could understand. It was usually just plain Japanese with no subtitles, Cantonese, or Spanish Language versions. Now, I can finally understand Vegeta's torment and fixation on Goku. How Vegeta always had to workout harde to always just try to catch up to Goku. How it enraged Vegeta to know that he'll always be second to Goku in strength. So, that's why Vegeta had to ""cheat"" and succumb to Babidi's spell to get that power boost to match up with Goku. Ah well. He's such a tragic anti-hero and that's whay I love him. Anyways, this dvd has good picture qualities which you might expect since these are more recently done than the older grainer looking DBZ dvds that we've seen. Definitely one to pick up if you're a Vegeta fan.",1004832000,,1173,4.585714285714285

Meanwhile Gohan And The Supreme Kia Go To Stop Babidi And Dubura. And The Final Eps Of This Tape Goku And Vegeta Continue Fighting And Buu Starts To Hatch.

1624299,4,B00005M2G1,"This is one not to miss. This is classic Akira at his best the long awaited fight between Son Gokou and Vegeta. Its some of the best action of all time. Just remember The Boo saga is next!!!!!This one is worth the price, Vegeta is classic in this one so anyone who loves to see Vegeta at his best(one bad dude)Then this DvD is for you.",1003449600,,335,4.090909090909091
1624300,5,B00005M2G1,"One word for this tape....EXCELLENT!  This tape is a must have for any anime fan.  The figthing is great as always, but this tape provided insight into the pain Vegeta has been carrying with him since he was abducted by Frieza as a child.  As a 25yr old female fan, I greatly appreciated the depth of emotions the animators showed us in both Vegeta and Goku.  Women everywhere will definitely love this one!",1001894400,4,407,4.534246575342466
1624301,5,B00005M2G1,"This is my first review, so I'll try to be careful. This video, without a doubt, has to be the best DBZ video on the market right now. I don't know what the other fights later in the series are like, but in my opinion, this one is the best.
Of course, uncut is the only way to go. The dialouge is intresting and somewhat faithful to it's original Japanese dialouge. But the animation and fight scenes are what make this tape so great. I recommend it to any DBZ fan, especially those new to the series. Even those who are constantly saying that the original DBZ's is Japanese are the best will have to like this one. Buy this tape, NOW.",1001548800,,635,4.213114754098361
1624302,5,B00005M2G1,"after killing hundreds of spectators and mr. satan running for cover vegeta now possessed by majin buu starts fighting goku at the tournament.... at full power! goku asks babidi if they can be teleported to the desert away from innocent people, babidi agrees. However babidi discovers that he can't corol him because of his tremendous pride(but allowing babidi to turn vegeta majin, just so he could become stronger so he could beat goku is in my eyes assistance and an act of cowardice). what pursues is the best battle in all of dragonball Z, and the release of....A LITTLE PINK BALL!!!! (and skipping a few episodes ahead vegeta makes his last act in this saga, not on this tape) and as i promised on my list here are the titles of some future tapes:  cell games: a moments peace ; cell games: guardians return ; cell games: the games begin ; cell games: surrender ; babidi: showdown ; majin buu: atonement ; majin buu: the hatching.",999388800,5,936,4.63855421686747
1624303,5,B00005M2G1,... We're here to review the english one so here goes...Rivals. That's what Goku and Vegeta started out as...rivals. Now despite everything they have been through in the end...that's what they still are is rivals. Now Babidi has awakened the evil inside Vegeta...and of course Vegeta did allow him. Enter...Majin Vegeta-mean and lean and bent on kicking Goku in the spleen. OK so I'm not a poet but the action is about to get fierce cause Majin Vegeta wants to go one on one with Goku and Babidi is gonna make it happen right in the tournament ring. And if Goku won't fight....well then let's just say Vegeta is gonna make some cole slaw out of the fans in the stands and he'll do it. Goku is backed into a a corner and he must fight...but if he does..then Babidi will have all the energy he needs to free Majin Buu. My my weren't things simpler when all we had to worry about was Raditz and his annoying boasting? You don't wanna miss out on this one folks cause it's Majin Vegeta and Goku and it's on!,997660800,13,1003,4.3689839572192515

7945061,5,B00005M2G1,"brilliant episodes in this video. babidi takes over vegetas mind and orders him to kill all gokus friends but vegeta only wants to fight goku his rival;goes with the title. meanwhile gohan and the supreme kai travel through babidis spaceship to try and stop majin buu hacthing from his cacoon. overall brillant dvd containing one of the best fights in dragonball history,goku the super saiyan 2 versus majin vegeta.",1143244800,,415,5.028985507246377
7945062,5,B00005M2G1,"The long awaited fight between Goku and Vegeta finally climaxes when Vegeta deliberately lets Babidi take control of his body and mind. He then continues to destroy helpless civilians while fueling Goku's rage. Vegeta having grown tired of the same mundane life wishes to travel back to his beginning episode stages where his heart was pure evil and his only concern was to be the strongest fighter in the galaxy. He tells Goku why everything has come to this point and they are transported to another plain to begin the battle. Meanwhile, Gohan attempts to destroy the bubble containing Majin Buu, but to no avail. This is the greatest number of episodes the series has seen to date. A must have for all Dragonball Z fans!",1114992000,,723,4.746031746031746
7945063,5,B00005M2G1,"This is one of the single greatest DBZ DVDs.  Not only do we get to see the fight between Goku and Majinn Vegeta begin, but we get quite possibly some of the best character interaction between the two.  When Vegeta screams why he hates Goku so much, and why he wants to take up his old ways, it's just impossible to not feel sorry for him.  And Goku, well, the scene between him and Kaioshin has to be seen.  It will leave you speechless.  Never have I seen Goku that angry, and I doubt I ever will again.  It is so easy to see that the battle between Goku and Vegeta can never actually have a winner, as the two battle it out to the death(or at least as dead as Goku can get), and who knows?  Maybe they both realize that their struggle against each other is ultimately futile and neither one of them can win, but just don't care.  All I know is, a DVD title has never been more appropriate.",1067904000,2,892,4.115606936416185
7945064,5,B00005M2G1,"These three episodes are some of the best eps in the history of dragonball. We see why vegeta hates goku so much, and after he explanes his pain you're not sure who to root for. Babidi's insanity and the terror on The S-kai's face as majin buu comes out is great! buy the uncut version for a funny urination scean, {watch this, I can write my name!.}
p.s. the really cool music plays in the last episode.",1017532800,,404,4.259740259740259
7945065,5,B00005M2G1,"This DVD reveals Vegeta's urge to be as carefree and all-powerful as he was as a young Saiya-jin Prince.  Why bother with a family, loud children, women, and even bills!  Restraint has never been his strength, but too little makes it his greatest weakness.  His feelings that his ""friends"" thought were long buried become evident; as does his remaining compassion, as he refuses to harm Gohan or Kaioshin.  The writers, especially in the Japanese version, did an excellent job.
My copy of this DVD has a picture of Vegeta on the cover, not Babidi as Amazon indicates.  Does anyone know if they changed it and why?",1017446400,,613,4.745283018867925

7945067,5,B00005M2G1,"On hearing about the taking over of Vegeta's body by Babidi in this saga, you knew there would be a huge explosion of revenge!! Vegeta, easily the most complex and exciting z fighter returns to his evil power-hungry self by allowing his manipulation which can mean only one thing....a long desired rematch with goku. While Gohan and Supreme Kai go after Babidi to prevent the re-awakening of Majin Buu, the two saiyans fight for their pride in a bid to find out who really is the strongest. This Fight alone is THE BEST FIGHT IN HISTORY OF DBZ!!!!, and the art work is at it's best at last. It seems that the two warriors match each other blow for blow, but is Goku really hiding his true power? And will Gohan and Supreme Kai stop the evil Buu's rebirth? GET THIS DVD!! IT WILL LEAVE YOU GASPING FOR MORE! All Vegeta fans like myself would die for this DVD.",1006992000,,858,4.40251572327044
