7710862,5,B01DD4KU9A,Danny Trejo... Enough said. Machete don't review,1499040000,,48,6.0
7710863,4,B01DD4KU9A,"Plot line is a bit (well, a lot) unbelievable, but the acting is good, the cast of characters pulls it off, and Danny Trejo really does a good job as an ex-federale who gets entangled in a situation that is regrettably far too plausible. I had a hard time seeing him as the sex object of Jessica Alba, Lindsey Lohan, and Michelle Rodriguez, but the rest of the show was good entertainment.",1494201600,,389,4.416666666666667
7710864,5,B01DD4KU9A,Magnificent movie.,1490745600,,18,8.5
7710865,5,B01DD4KU9A,"I am not a huge fan of the action genre. However, I am a big fan of Machete and it's sequel Machete Kills. I remember when I first saw Machete in the theater and we (the audience) had no idea what we were in for. They are both fantastic films and you won't be on the fence, you'll love them or hate them.",1490140800,,304,3.8412698412698414
7710866,5,B01DD4KU9A,"This movie is really fun. It is pure sugar and action.  The plot of this movie is entertaining. I am happy to say that I did not find any of the scenes boring.  There are also a lot of A+ actors in this film.  If you want to just enjoy a movie, I recommend this one.",1489795200,,266,3.7142857142857144

Action with a Comical Air!

8755530,5,B01DD4KU9A,Very entertaining action film,1518998400,,29,6.5
8755531,2,B01DD4KU9A,"It was ok, entertaining enough but pretty mediocre. I expected it to be over the top ridiculous like Rodroguez's planet terror but it wasn't except for a few scenes. It was slow at times and the actions sequences weren't quite worth the wait. I'm sure some would like it but to me it was just mediocre at best.",1518566400,,310,4.362068965517241
