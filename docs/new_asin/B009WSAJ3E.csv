8544713,5,B009WSAJ3E,"In the power of rejection Mikhail Tank offers the audience a series of
vignettes that are in turn soulful, joyful, soothing, angry, haunting
and sweet.  He is a performer, a story teller and a mystic.  Using a
combination of spoken word, poetry and performance art his messages are
powerful and uplifting. There are layers; everything (the props, the
music, the clothes he wears) seems to have meaning.  He has a beautiful
voice and uses it as the instrument it is.  His stories touch me.
There are times when I watch it that I feel like he is looking deep
inside me and telling, not only his own story, but mine.  Mikhail
takes you on a journey that is quintessentially his own and somehow
gifts it to his audience.  I believe there is something here for
everyone.",1351296000,,765,4.588235294117647

However, this was a pleasant surprise. Mikhail puts his heart and soul into his work, giving a final product that is top notch. What I found most amazing is that he uses various methods to convey a message of hope even when you might feel lost in a world that can be hyper-critical. If you ever feel down and are looking for inspiration, I highly suggest this DVD!",1351209600,,534,4.404040404040404
