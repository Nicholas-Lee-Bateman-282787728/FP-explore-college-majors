2654190,5,B000IB0DDK,The tv show is great. I love the old school nascar tapes. The pop-ups can be distracting but are neat also. If you enjoy racing the dvd is for you.

2654200,5,B000IB0DDK,"I was recently given the opportunity to offically review Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s DVD set BACK IN THE DAY Complete Season One on my blog, The Church of The Great Oval. BACK IN THE DAY is a treasure trove of information on the history of NASCAR. Whether you are an old school fan of the sport or a newbie to NASCAR, it is an investment you won't regret. Dale Jr. has done an excellent job in allowing the watcher to learn more about the most popular sport in the U.S. through this wonderful trip through the past. You watch and learn many of the same things that Dale Jr. learned in the same way he did, by watching the old TV show ""Car and Track"". Many of the most famous races and tracks of the 60's and 70's are highlighted, and the differences in the rules and regulations then and today are blatantly obvious. The Driver's then, drove to win. They didn't drive to please anyone but their own competitive drive and that meant doing what they had to do to win. Safety today and safety then is like black and white. The ""old school"" driver's were, in my opinion 1/4 brave and 3/4 crazy! Those driver's, made the sport what it is today. Buy it!! You will watch it over and over!!",1171065600,8,1175,4.297297297297297
