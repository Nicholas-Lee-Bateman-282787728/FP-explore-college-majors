8115408,1,B000EXDRNU,"I have never been so disappointed in a product ordered from Amazon before.  In making a choice as to which ""movie"" to purchase I thought this would provide a little more authenticity.  No where in the purchase information was it disclosed that this was a musical play.  I would really like to send this product back and get my money back.  The students hated it and made fun of it so I stopped showing it.  I use movies as an addition to novels that we read in class and this was a HUGE disappointment.",1306800000,5,502,4.297872340425532
