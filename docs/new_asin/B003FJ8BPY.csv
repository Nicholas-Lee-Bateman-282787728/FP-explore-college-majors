If you understand the spiritual side of Ninpo ( Warrior arts, Qui Kong, etc. etc) the link between Voice, imagery, and emotional state can be unified..  This book merely brings this back into focus..

While this book lacks the depth needed from a beginners stand point it has some decent info once the basic's are attained and again can be used more as a guide than a learning tool..",1412294400,,551,4.425742574257426
8395996,2,B003FJ8BPY,"I'm sorry, but I purchased this DVD to be instructed in how to perform these kanji's.
I expected Master Hayes to explain how to do them, step by step and slowly. Perhaps meditate or breathing techniquesor visualization associated with each one.

Some of them he blew right past so fast I had to rewind and slow it down. Half the times his hands are below the screen.

He explained what they were about but I can get that through a book. Now I will have to resort to the books again to be instructed.

This was like sitting in an interview, 80 minutes of talk. This is not an instructional dvd. I have watched instructional dvd's by David Carradine, Mantak Chia and Steven DeMasco so I know one when I see one.

I did not come away instructed, or enlightned. I came away frustrated that I wasted $29.95 on this DVD.",1299974400,14,814,4.370860927152318
