8002767,2,B0000TPBBO,"I have seen this movie on European television and it was magnificent.  The first 70 percent of the movie is a bit slow but given time, it eventually builds up towards the breath-taking combat scenes towards the end.  The final 30% makes up for the first 70% tenfold!!  The cinematography, the music (a disco rip-off of Clint Eastwood's Hang'Em'High)are just as great.  Casanova Wong is quite a graceful and agile fighter in this one.

I was VERY UPSET upon viewing this movie in DVD format in the states.  It was like they used something worse than EP mode because the frame rate was EXTREMELY choppy.  But if you are a die hard kung fu flick fan, I still have to recommend getting this for the movie's final moments.  Yes, it is that good.  Another thing interesting to note is that the opening credits are in Italian, just as I saw it in Italy all those years ago.  Strange; wonder if it was only released there?",1095724800,4,914,4.484848484848484
