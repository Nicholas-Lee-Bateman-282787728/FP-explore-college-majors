It reminded me of another diet-food-con out there. Advertising in the stores. Where shoppers are often their weakest. She uses the famous Fat Formula in the store. Add this to Jonathan's Pond's buy the small size of everything and Richard Simmons's shop the perimeter of the store. You have a real plan to beat the stores at their own game. Taking your hard earned money.",1294963200,,508,4.473118279569892
7840382,5,6303179460,"I saw this video at my local Big Lots store for a dollar so I decided to pick it up as it was one I had always been curious to see.  In this 40 minute program, Susan Powter will show you how to get rid of unhealthy items in your kitchen, shop for healthy low fat choices, and shows you examples of typical meals and low fat substitutions you can prepare.

The first few minutes Susan goes through her cabinets, refrigerator and freezer and tosses items that most people think they can't live without that have lots of fat, then she goes shopping at the local grocery store during the middle of the night.  She is all by herself in the store and takes you up and down each aisle and fills her cart in a hurry.  She explains the fat formula, which is the amount of fat grams on the label times 9, then that amount divided by the number of calories which gives you the percentage of fat in any given item.  After watching this video I went through my own food stock and did this formula and was quite surprised to see some of the numbers.  Susan advises you to use the formula while shopping to assist in making healthier food choices, she also points out obvious no no items.  I really enjoyed this part of the video, she made it interesting and she gave her opinions on how she felt on certain health foods, such as plain rice cakes and rye bread.  Once she gets the groceries home, she will show examples of a high fat prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner, then a lower fact substitution of each.  She also gives low fat options throughout the video, such as removing yolks from eggs, etc.  The very last segment shows Susan in her bed with her flannel jammies and a giant bow in her head where she reads some fan letters and answers questions.

I think Susan Powter is a hoot, not everyone agrees with me on that but I like her.  I think this is a good video, she explains on how dieting and deprivation do not work and that you need to eat, 3 meals a day, just eat high volume low fat foods.  I would say she knows what she is talking about, she is living proof, it certainly worked for her.",1145750400,4,2093,4.228643216080402
