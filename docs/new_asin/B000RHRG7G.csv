8200808,4,B000RHRG7G,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights.  I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's.  It became just another DVD to the collection.",1349222400,,183,3.918918918918919
8200809,4,B000RHRG7G,"Let me start by saying that I am extremely happy with the producers for fixing the faux pas they committed in the previous event. The breaks between rounds, replays and interviews are back, making this once again a complete product. Now, in terms of the quality of the fights, except for a couple of disappointing bouts on the main card, this was an exceptional event.

The under card fights are collectively the best I have seen among all the events so far. It looked more like something out of Ultimate Knockouts and Submissions than just your normal preliminary fights. These confrontations had it all, incredible slugfests, nice submissions, and maybe more importantly, athletes that came into the ring wanting to leave everything in their effort to succeed. Sadly, not all the bouts in the main card had these characteristics. Arlovsky vs. Werdum was the most disappointing fight of the night, which almost put me to sleep. I got the impressions that these guys were more worried about not getting hurt than about winning, which is surprising, especially coming from the ex-champion. Kongo vs. Silva was the other match-up that lacked excitement, but this was caused by the lack of skill of the contenders, Kongo having no ground game and Silva poor stand-up.

Luckily, the rest of the fights were outstanding. In Heath vs. Machida you can watch one of the most versatile and unconventional competitors in the UFC against a guy that has a will of steel. Bisping vs. Sinosic is such an intense bout that you can feel the electricity jumping off the screen. Finally, the main event of the evening is one of the best I have ever seen. With the meanest kicker in the game against a master at submissions, this fight was likely to go to the one that covered his weaknesses better. If you are not left speechless by the conclusion, I would be surprised. Overall, this is a high quality event that I recommend wholeheartedly.",1193529600,4,1923,4.806646525679758
8200810,5,B000RHRG7G,"Overall, the UFC 70 fight card was pretty good, but the heavyweight main event, Mirko Cro Cop vs. Gabriel ""Napao"" Gonzaga, particularly the finish, was awesome.

Everyone knew that Cro Cop was the striker with devastating head kicks, and Gonzaga, a jiu jitsu black belt, was the ground-and-pound and submission fighter.  However, nobody - and I mean NOBODY! - expected Gonzaga to take a page out of Cro Cop's book and BLAST the Croatian warrior with a head kick knockout in the final seconds of Round 1.  Yet, that's exactly what happened: Gonzaga ""Cro Cop'ed"" Cro Cop!  Seeing how Cro Cop's right knee and ankle bent hideously under the weight of his torso as he fell to the mat was also a sight to behold, as painful as it was to watch.  I'm surprised he didn't snap every ligament and tendon in his right leg on the way down.

Gonzaga will face Randy Couture for the Heavyweight belt at UFC 74: Respect, Saturday, August 25.  But don't count out Cro Cop.  He'll be back.",1184112000,2,973,4.551724137931035
