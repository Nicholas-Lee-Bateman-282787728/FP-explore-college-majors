8605539,5,B00EI3XOJ4,"I love this movie. I fell in love with silent films after watching many Silent Sundays on Turner Classic Movie Channel. All the actors in the movie were wonderful. The film takes place and was filmed  in Philadelphia, Pa. a place I know well and it was great to see it in the 1920's. The story line was well told and I found myself glued to it just to find out how it all played out.  You won't be disappointed. GOOD FILM , GOOD PRICE!!",1444953600,3,436,4.117647058823529

8605541,2,B00EI3XOJ4,"I didn't know it was a silent film, so I couldnt' really get into it. My eyes are bad, so couldn't read it that well.",1424217600,,117,3.72
8605542,3,B00EI3XOJ4,"Pay attention to the information in bold in the ""editorial review.""  This comes in a clear case with no artwork.  It has no menu, no chapters.  If you want to get to Scar of Shame, you have to fast forward through Noble Sissle & Eubie Blake. It's clearly a copy made from a VHS tape, and not a great tape.  This is as bare bones as it gets.  I'm not reviewing the movie, but the DVD product, which is appropriate.  I'll give three stars, as it's the only option, and it's good that there is an option, but it's too bad there isn't a better option.",1378425600,5,547,4.113207547169812
8605543,5,B00EI3XOJ4,"This seller sent the video ordered within a week after I ordered it and it arrived in great condition.  I work at a museum that covers California history and we decided to convert our old VHS tapes to DVDs.  Not only were the prices reasonable, but the entire process was smooth and professional.  I would definitely use this seller again.",1341964800,2,339,4.616666666666666
