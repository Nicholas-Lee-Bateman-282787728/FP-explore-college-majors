5092091,5,B007K7IB1G,"This movie was a complete surprise. I found it randomly on a streaming site that starts with ""N.""

This is a story about two slackers/small time criminals who find themselves caring for a 12 year-old boy. The story shifts from comedy to fatherhood, and how families form as needed. There is still a lot of humor in the story, until it reaches a certain point where it's breaking your heart.

The film pays off. Highly recommended.

So many films today want to portray young men, and fathers in particular as losers trying to escape parenting. This is a story about people who fight for it.",1361750400,5,589,4.59047619047619
5092092,5,B007K7IB1G,"A quirky indie film, initially no character seems appealing (or one that you'd want to identify with), but the story draws out some redeeming qualities. One of those movies that when its over, you sit for a moment in awe.",1358812800,,221,4.55
5092093,5,B007K7IB1G,"A Bag of Hammers starring Jason Ritter and Jake Sandvig is one of those movies that starts off as a comedy and then halfway through, shifts to a serious, thoughtful film. A Bag of Hammers is the story of two slackers who suddenly become a father figure to a seriously neglected boy named Kelsey. Rebeca Hall and Amanda Seyfried also star. I really loved this movie, I felt like the ending was so moving and you could really feel the love for this troubled boy. I highly recommend it, enjoy!",1357430400,3,490,4.455555555555556
5092094,4,B007K7IB1G,"This film has such a good story and manages a perfect balance of comedy and drama.  Everything from the writing to the actors' portrayals to the music was really well executed.  It has both warm, dry, and dark humor and each character feels real and complex.  Highly recommend it - you won't be sorry!!",1354147200,2,302,4.555555555555555
5092095,1,B007K7IB1G,This DVD was advertized as a comedy and I think there was one line that we found amusing. It was very dull and boring and we destroyed it after we watched it one time.,1349136000,2,167,3.9411764705882355
5092096,5,B007K7IB1G,"A Bag of Hammers is definitely the best movie of 2012 so far. This is great for nearly every audience. I rarely feel compelled to write a review of movies, but I feel obligated to share how amazing A Bag of Hammers is and hope it will persuade readers to watch. It's moving, funny and sincere. I don't want to give any of the story away, hope all enjoy it!",1344902400,,356,4.1
5092097,5,B007K7IB1G,"I love this quirky, smart, dramatic, touching indie film. The acting is superb by actors Jake Sandvig, Jason Ritter, and Rebecca Hall. It has a bit of everything you could want in a film, I just wish it was in theaters for a longer period of time :)",1339718400,6,249,4.208333333333333
5092098,5,B007K7IB1G,"[...] review: Ben and Alan have built a successful though larcenous business, posing as car valets, only to steal the vehicles instead of parking them. Because of their less-than-ideal childhoods and a ""job"" that allows them to remain likeable boyish rogues well into their 20s, their penchant for crime is almost forgivable. However, everything changes when they meet a twelve-year-old boy named Kelsey. Neglected by his mother, Kelsey is drawn to Ben and Alan and they to him - eventually, Kelsey becomes part mascot, part protg. His presence ultimately forces Alan and Ben to choose between a life of crime and fun (an extended childhood) and the opportunity to grow up and deal with the emotional consequences that come with it.

5092100,2,B007K7IB1G,"the first hour or so of the movie is quite entertaining. i got the impression, however, that they must have run out of money to hire someone to write a legitimate ending for the movie because it leaves you hanging...and not in a thought-provoking way, unless you share my thought that a much more creative wrap-up of the story would have made this a five-star proposition. an overall  disappointment!",1405728000,2,400,4.797101449275362
5092101,5,B007K7IB1G,It was a touching movie. I really enjoyed it! Watch part of it on cable and just had to see the beginning,1391644800,,105,3.8181818181818183
5092102,4,B007K7IB1G,"This was a wonderful movie.  I enjoyed the acting and the story line.  It hit home on many aspects.  The thing that bothered me the most about the story line is that had the two main characters showed compassion earlier, both the mother AND the son could have enjoyed a brighter future.  It is a sad commentary on American life.  Ironically, prior to the mother's choice, she was to blame for her family's situation.  No one was willing to help her help herself.  It is unfortunate that it was the only way for her to get the help that she needed for her son.  It has left me emotionally disturbed and doing a bit of soul searching myself.",1391472000,2,639,4.3559322033898304
5092103,5,B007K7IB1G,"At first I did think this movie was going to be funny and it was...at times...the other times well it tugged at your heart strings and caused a misting effect to my eyeballs which I won't get into. The 2 leads Jake Sandvig and Jason Ritter....are superb and play there parts like they were born to them. The little boy, he will grab you. So what exactly is the relationship between the 2 guys? You decide and no matter what you decide you will love them.",1391212800,,454,4.290697674418604
5092104,5,B007K7IB1G,This is a really good movie. I had never heard of it and noticed it on Amazon.  Jason Ritter is amazing. Definitely worth watching.,1376352000,2,131,4.458333333333333
5092105,4,B007K7IB1G,"very funny movie but touching as well, with a touch of emotional tearing, very surprising. how a sudden change in your can make you a better person.",1375660800,,148,4.518518518518518
5092106,4,B007K7IB1G,"The title of this movie is very clunky - ""Bag of Hammers""?!?! - and is not what you might expect. Why it was given that name is not explained until about midway through the movie - which is fine, but it does make you wonder, and may keep people from watching it. (The explanation makes total sense, btw.)

Essentially, best friends Ben and Alan support themselves by stealing cars in an unnamed California city. They pose as complimentary valet parkers at funerals and then take one of the vehicles - literally, put their ""complimentary valet"" sign in the car and drive off with it - and sell it to their friend Marty. Alan's sister Melanie does not approve of this activity, but she doesn't seem to mind taking money from their nefarious deeds, nor driving one of the cars (which I assume was not actually stolen, but we don't know for sure). Mel works as a waitress at a diner, and is going to college (studying some unknown subject).

Their situation changes when the pair rent a bungalow next to their house (which I thought was also a scam!) to a single mom with a 12-year-old son, Kelsey. The mom, Lynette, is a bona fide mess and neglects her son, who ends up hanging out with the boys. ***SPOILER ALERT*** When Lynette kills herself, Ben and Alan take on the task of raising Kelsey - at least until Mel turns them in to Child Protective Services.***END SPOILER***

The movie has a lot of things going for it. A great cast (including Jason Ritter, John Ritter's son... the entire time I watched the movie I wondered why he looked so familiar!) who fully inhabit their roles, an interesting storyline, and the tackling of topics - such as child abuse and neglect - that are usually either ignored or so fully embraced that they become tiresome. And it's a thoughtful commentary on family and friendship and caring. It's not a comedy, tho there is definitely some humor.

The movie also has a lot of things wrong with it. We never really know if Ben and Alan are a couple, or just best friends. It was annoying that it was so ambiguous. The story might have been stronger if we had known, either way. The fact that they never get caught at their criminal activity is a bit hard to believe.

We learn, slowly (which is fine), that they had grown up together in Fresno and they'd had a horrible childhood. We are only given a glimpse of what happened to them, and we know that Alan left Melanie at home (""to get hit"") and took Ben with him... but we don't know how Mel escaped or why she came to them. On the one hand, I appreciated not having the child abuse situation hammered at the viewer (yes, pun intended), but it was also a cloud over everything, a cloud that was mostly ignored and never explained.

Lynette's motivations are quite clear, but her ***SPOILER ALERT*** suicide ***END SPOILER*** could have been examined more fully. The treatment it was given was no more than a weather change would have been given.

The ending of the movie also left something (A LOT) to be desired. Did Alan and Ben learn from their mistakes? Did they change their ways? Did they grow up? We don't know and can't tell from the montage of images the filmmaker threw at us - almost as if he'd shot all of that footage, and just *had* to use it.

However, even with the negatives, I enjoyed this movie. If you like thoughtful indies, then I recommend it!",1372204800,3,3346,4.482758620689655

8518642,5,B007K7IB1G,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It deals with really heavy, emotional topics, but from a guys perspective.  I have to admit, I am a woman, so seeing it from a guys perspective was really refreshing; really moving, yet so subtle.  Great cast, but the three main characters were amazing.  Thanks to all who created this film.",1529539200,,340,4.451612903225806
8518643,5,B007K7IB1G,"Not really a comedy, but a REALLY heartwarming if a bit offbeat drama. Found this movie since I wanted to Gabriel Macht act in something other than Suits. He has a good role in this but the really star is the little boy. Unbelievably good acting. Sandvig, Ritter and Macht wonderful as well. Definitely worth taking the time to watch.",1528502400,,334,4.583333333333333
