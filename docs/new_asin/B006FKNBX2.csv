4985116,4,B006FKNBX2,"My boys are 6. They enjoy this show.  Bobby has fun with his Uncle and family and has a lot of imaginary fun that plays out in his mind.  Things that little kids can relate to.  Lots of story lines where Bobby is trying to understand what the adults mean when they say things.  Bobby takes everything so literal and that is always cute and fun for my kids.  The only thing that I find annoying - my sons only noticed it in the beginning is that since the show is older, it isn't in HD. Boy, we are spoiled.",1394928000,,506,4.02
4985117,5,B006FKNBX2,Wholesome! Not like the tv shows coming out these days. Reminds me of my childhood. It is very age appropriate.,1393372800,,111,4.6
4985118,5,B006FKNBX2,Nostalgia plus animation.  Relive the funny moments of your childhood from the eyes of Bobby.  Voiced by Howie Mandel.  Must for the whole family.,1368489600,,146,5.0
4985119,5,B006FKNBX2,"I loved Bobby's World when it used to come on TV years ago. My young son reminds me a lot of Bobby with his inquisitive mind. You can actually see my son's wheels churning as you speak with him about everyday things. I thought that getting the CD would be nice for him. I was right, he loves them.",1355270400,,297,4.0508474576271185
4985120,4,B006FKNBX2,I thought there was something wrong with my DVD. The quality is poor. The previous review helped me realize that it wasn't just my DVDs  But my kids and I just love the show.,1335484800,,174,4.117647058823529
4985121,4,B006FKNBX2,"Bobby's World debuted in 1990, as part of the FOX Kids lineup. It is also the longest running (in reference to how long it lasted, not how many episodes it had) FOX Kids show on the network, lasting 8 seasons and 81 episodes in total; although the DVDs being sold on Amazon has 7 seasons total...don't be alarmed, all 81 episodes are still presented. The show is about the very imaginative adventures of Bobby Generic (pronounced JEN-a-rick, not jin-AIR-ick...a running joke on the show). It was created by Howie Mandel (Deal or No Deal; current judge on America's Got Talent).

You've probably read my review for Season 1, so now, we move on to Season 2. The second season is quite a short one, at only 8 episodes. However, it's 8 enjoyable episodes, and for that, I'm sure fans will still have a good time with this set.

Video Quality: 2.5/5

This is pretty much a repeat of my Season 1 review, word for word: The episodes are presented in their original aspect ratio of 1.33:1. That's one good thing, at least. The quality, though, is a mess. Very noticeable scan lines on some scenes, dirt, debris...the works. I wasn't expecting miracles for a show from 1990, but I've also seen VHS that looked better than this. All is not a total loss, though. Episodes, for the most part, are very much watchable, and some scenes do look just fine.

Audio Quality: 3.5/5

The episodes are presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo, at 192 kbps. The audio quality is just fine, for the most part. It's very standard stereo quality that you'd expect from a 90's cartoon. Nothing more, nothing less. Unlike Season 1, the credits music sounds just fine in Season 2. That would explain the extra half point in the rating score.

The Episodes:

Here's what's included in the Season 2 DVD set, along with runtimes:

1. Three Kids And A Baby (19:33)
2. Suspects, Lies And Videotape (19:34)
3. Caution: Bobby At Work (19:36)
4. Clubhouse Bobby (19:34)
5. Chariots Of Bobby (19:33)
6. Total Recess (19:43)
7. Nightmare On Bobby's Street (19:33)
8. Bobby's Birthday Bash (19:37)

Just like Season 1, the episodes are PAL-sourced (4% speed up...see my Season 1 review for more information). Although, it doesn't affect the entire episode. The opening and closing segments with Howie Mandel, along with the end credits are presented in their proper speed. Why the weird switch from NTSC-sourced material to PAL-sourced is beyond me. Despite the speed up, there are no cuts to report. Everything is as originally aired. Yes, that means the very short lengths are normal. If one were to fix the 4% speed issue, 19:35 in PAL would equate to around 20:25 NTSC in proper speed. For comparison, the episode ""Suspects, Lies And Videotape"" was 20:21 on the Signature Episodes DVD released by Anchor Bay in 2004 (which, for the record, didn't have the 4% speed up issue, and also had slightly-superior video quality, but not by much). For the closing logo fanatics, there are closing logos for ""Film Roman"", ""FOX Children's Programming"" and ""Saban International"".

Wrap-Up and Recommendation:

If you liked Season 1, you'll definitely like Season 2. Season 2 has the debut of Jackie, the girl who lives next door to Bobby and the Generic family, and has a crush on Bobby. Once again, we're presented with the same problems that the Season 1 DVD had. Why the faster episodes? I simply don't know. The DVD still comes recommended to fans, but do proceed with caution.",1332288000,4,3431,4.7592592592592595
