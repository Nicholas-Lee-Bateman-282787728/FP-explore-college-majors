Also includes their impacts upon society. However, only Gehrig is heard from as a portion of his 'Luckiest Man on Earth' speech is played. Insightful. .A lot of archival footage.

8263480,3,B0016MXKE4,"There seem to be a lot of baseball DVDs lately. Lots of good ones. A few bad ones. And then there's this.

This is a real el-cheapo production, slapped together using Public Domain stock footage that you've seen a thousand times if you're a New York Yankees fan. There are what I guess you could call miniature biographies of the big names. If you are a casual fan or new to learning Yankee or baseball history, you'll get quite a bit for your money. If you are well-versed in those pursuits, however, skip it. Get the multi-disc ""Yankeeoraphy"" set.

Quality-wise.....not too good. Don't watch it on a huge screen. In fact, stick it in your computer and watch it when you have some time to kill. It's resolution is definitely as good as anything you'll dig up on YouTube.",1362355200,,771,4.539568345323741
