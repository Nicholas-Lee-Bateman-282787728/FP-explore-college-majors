6075385,5,B00GGVJIRS,"I loved this movie. The child actors they used did an excellent job portraying what must have been very difficult scenes. The movie flowed seamlessly through telling the story of a child prodigy chess player. This is actually based on a true story.

That is until I bumped into some folks like in this movie that were really, REALLY good. The game is the best in the world and will always be. However, even if you don't play chess, it's just a lovely true story of a young boys discovery of his passion. A good movie in its own right. It's not Star Wars or James Bond. It's just a really, really nice story.",1456790400,4,482,4.08421052631579

6075408,4,B00GGVJIRS,"The movie is excellent, as you probably know.  The only reason I did not rate this DVD five stars is the cropped picture.  The studio used the pan-and-scan version of the movie, and ""zoomed"" the picture to fill a 16:9 screen.  As a result, the picture is cropped on all four sides.  It should have been left to the viewer to choose to zoom the picture or watch it in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  Ideally, of course, the widescreen version of the movie should have been used.",1440115200,,468,4.333333333333333

6075414,5,B00GGVJIRS,"Great story, and Bobby Fischer film footage is a bonus.",1435449600,,55,4.6
6075415,4,B00GGVJIRS,"Despite the title, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993) isn't about the extraordinary chess champion, but rather true-life chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin (played convincingly by  Max Pomeranc). The story chronicles his rise to prominence as a 7-8 year-old in the world of chess competition. The eccentric and reclusive Fischer permeates the proceedings, however, as hes constantly referred to and theres even footage of him being interviewed or beating a dozen experts simultaneously, etc. Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen play Joshs father & mother while Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne play his formal and informal teachers respectively.

I don't think you need to know about chess to enjoy this film, but it wouldnt hurt. Its primarily a drama and, secondarily, a sports film. Being about chess, it lacks the action of conventional sports films, but its a sports film nevertheless with its inherent formula. Regardless, I was surprised at how suspenseful they made the final match, which isn't easy to do since chess doesnt seemingly lend itself to cinema.

This is a film thatll likely improve on repeat viewings because there are a few interesting subtexts. For instance, Joshs formal instructor and his dad keep trying to mold him into the likeness of Fischer and his misanthropic mindset, but Joshs mother and informal instructor encourage him to be who he is and play naturally. The former two foster rigid discipline and contemptible aggressiveness while the latter two encourage spontaneity and the joy of the game. Perhaps a balance between both is best.

Years ago I informally studied chess for a couple of years, reading books and manually performing all the moves, buying & playing computer sets, etc. but Id only be considered average at best compared to the child players in the film. The reason I bring this up is because, as much as I knew on the topic at the time, I realized I merely touched the surface and that there were whole new realms to explore, learn and master. This is the way it is with any great sport/art/topic/occupation. To truly grasp any one of them and master it to any degree requires serious determination and great sacrifice. You cant be a jack of all trades and expect to be extraordinary in one.

The movie also seems to be saying that you shouldnt sacrifice everything else to be a chess master and lose the joy of playing, the joy of living. After all, what good is that? While this is true, it only goes so far and Waitzkins life since the movie proves it: He wanted to do other things than be a chess champion, which is fine, but to do so he had to drop out of chess competition altogether, which he did in 1999. By contrast, Garry Kasparov is considered the most consistent chess champion, holding the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world from 1986 to 2005 (two freakin decades), precisely because of his skill, determination and sacrifices.

The movie inspires you to look up the incredible Fischer who reigned supreme in the 60s through early 70s and then dropped off the face of the earth. In 1981 he stayed with grandmaster Peter Biyiasas for four months where he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in speed chess. Biyiasas later testified in a Sports Illustrated interview: He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. Bobby honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.

Bobby Fischer never viewed the film, but rightly complained that it was improper to use his name and footage of him without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the movie and said he was swindled.

Look for the beautiful Laura Linney in a bit part.

The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in New York City, including Washington Square (where numerous scenes take place), and Toronto.

6075419,5,B00GGVJIRS,"Patzer. I have not heard that word since my days on my high school chess team. I have always wanted to see SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and somehow just seemed to miss it. I finally caught it on the Sundance Channel and have watched at least 3 times now. This film was worth the wait. Let me tell you. This is a great film. You don't have to like Chess. You don't even have to play Chess. Yes, this film lets you into that world that I was once part of, but better yet, it separates men and boys who have that higher level of insight into the game, it separates them by their passion and honor and dedication for the game and for those mere mortals who play the game on that same field. What is the purpose of the game? I think the film asks that question. And I think the film answers it aptly. I remember once at a tournament that I offered my opponent a draw even though it was evident that I had clearly beaten him. I overheard that if my opponent did not win or draw he was off his school's team. When I watched SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER that all came back to me. That is what this excellent film is about.",1428019200,,1112,4.082191780821918

6075422,5,B00GGVJIRS,"I went to a special school for the blind for pre school. My best friend from that school I went to with and his parents rented this movie for my family on VHS and we would all sit around and watch it while playing Chess. I just recently bought the DVD from Amazon.com so I could watch it for the very first time again, plus I have been so into playing Chess recently. After watching this movie, I suddenly want to play Chess and a great musical score by James Horner too. Great movie especially if you love to play Chess like I do. Peter Smith

6075424,5,B00GGVJIRS,"A must have in your DVD collection!  This is a wonderful and feel good movie about a gifted boy who learned and understood the game of chess.  It is also the story of a boy who typically wanted to have fun doing something, but had a difficult time sharing this ""normal"" feeling with the people around him.  It also showed how family and friends who may have delighted in a gifted youth's gaming talents, naturally gravitated towards ambitions of harnessing that talent for fame (and possibly fortune) without realizing what it is doing to the child.  It is a story appealing to our human sides and emotions while opening the world inside a ""normal"" child's mind.  Just wonderful to watch over and over again!",1424390400,3,708,4.67741935483871

6075427,5,B00GGVJIRS,"This is one of those rare films that stays with you, but without it being one individual element of the film that causes it.. There are no histrionics, no action scenes, it's not a comedy, nor a romance. And yet it is a love story. It is an ode to human appreciation, and to the fragility of the human mind. It is also a battle for the truth and balance of life. This film boasts an ensemble of great actors, where all the leads are magnificent, and magnificently understated. Laurence Fishburne as the inspirational street punk chess hustler, and Ben Kingsley as the emotionally shell-shocked ex-chess champion, deliver forcefully restrained performances, and Joe Mantegna delivers whirlwind of feelings as the father. But Max Pomeranc strides with assurance into his portrayal of seven year old Joshua, the chess prodigy. Watch out for some interesting cameos too.",1421884800,5,866,4.979310344827586

6075432,4,B00GGVJIRS,"There are any number of films out there based on true stories/people and, as with any genre, they are of various levels of quality. This is, for y dollar, one of the better ones..

Here's the scoop. Joe Mantegna is a sports writer for the New York Times. His wife (Joan Allen) while in the park with her son Josh (Max Pomeranc) happen across a large group of street type folk, one being Laurence Fishburne, playing speed chess. Josh is mildly fascinated by the game and it turns out he just simply 'gets it.' Dad goes on to get him a renowned tutor (Ben Kingsley) but mom also doesn't mind letting Josh take more than a few tips from Fishburne. Josh is pulled in a few directions and things need to sort themselves out.

This is a way cool flick. First time director Steven Zaillian does a nice job of balancing all the factors in play. Dad is into sports. He wants his son to be the best and totes him around to the various tournaments. Kingsley thinks he has another Bobby Fischer in the making so he schools him in the classical method of chess and tries to instill in him that winning is everything. But little Josh likes playing with Fishburne in the park because he learns from him AND it's fun. Mom wants to see her son be the boy he already is so she makes certain no one does him harm.

It's great seeing pre-fame Laura Linney, Tony Shaloub, David Paymer and others. All do a sweet job. It's shot well with a good music score. As I mentioned, the story elements are balanced well though I could have used a bit more of Laurence Fishburne. He nearly disappears in the middle of things. Josh does a great job for this being his first time at bat. He's just very natural. Some aspects of the script might be a bit too obvious for some but the way said aspects are written and directed opens these ideas up to a wider audience. For this kind of movie I think that's important.

If you want a good, solid two hour film experience, you could do way worse.",1417564800,9,1958,4.29810298102981

8622911,5,B00GGVJIRS,"Since the first time I saw this movie, it has been one of my all-time favorites. It is not a cinematic masterpiece by any merans, and does not star box office superstars, but what it provides is the true life-inspired story of how the pure beauty, love and goodness of a child's heart can been overlooked or minimized by adults in their need to exploit genius to fulfill their own shortcomings and insecurities. What is unconsciously normal and important to a child is so different than what is important to most adults. Based on the life of child chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin, there is so much truth in the message of this movie, maybe even more now in a world where sports and competition garner obscene wealth and glory in return from brief entertainment and with growing emphasis on rewarding the mocking of opponents and gloating.  The cast is perfect. The child paying Josh could't have been more precisely cast. And the ""prodigy"" here depicts the mind and loving heart we all should hope and strive for.
