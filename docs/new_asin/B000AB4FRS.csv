2384328,5,B000AB4FRS,"Following Mozart's final youthful opera, Il re pastore, which was composed in 1775 (see the fine new DVD performance from Salzburg conducted by Neville Marriner), Mozart received no new operatic commissions (other than the fragment Zaide) until 1780-81. He spent those 5 years internalising all of European music, always yearning to write opera, always searching for a good libretto and a new commission. Idomeneo was finally commissioned for Munich by Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria, and premiered in Munich in 1781. Although theoretically an example of opera seria, Idomeneo should more properly be considered embryonic Grand Opera. There is something Verdian about this great dramatic masterpiece. Idomeneo is a true tragic hero: literally buffeted by fate in a sea-storm, he is placed in the untenable position of saving himself by promising Neptune he would sacrifice the first living creature he met upon returning home to Crete. He has a chance meeting with Idamante, who has been roaming the shore. Idomeneo, less than thrilled by this random encounter, reacts even more coolly after recognizing his son, now grown. Idamante, dismayed by his father's puzzling lack of affection, is also beset by amorous issues: he is loved by the proud princess Electra, but he is in love with a Trojan princess, Ilia, who rejects him. Ilia was sent to Crete, along with other prisoners of war, by Idomeneo in advance of his return from Troy. Neptune's impatience for a sacrifice, the intricacies of love and ambition, the nature of power and fate, all make up the fabric of Mozart's Grand Opera. It is unquestionably a masterpiece.

This makes Idomeneo's subsequent performance history particularly puzzling. It was revived only once in Mozart's lifetime, was performed fairly frequently in Austria and Germany following his death, but did not reach England until 1934 and still was not performed professionally until Glyndebourne in 1951. It was first produced in America in 1947 at the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood, in Lenox Massachusetts. Most stunningly of all, Idomeneo's very first performance at the Met did not occur until 14 October 1982: this very production! The seventh performance, given on 6 November, is the one filmed here.

Mozart's use of a chorus is years ahead of its time: dramatic without being declamatory, he gave his people of Crete some of the most beautiful melodies he had composed this early in his operatic career. Of special note is the exquisite embarkation chorus, Placido e il mar. One of the features that makes this production so superb is the excellence of the Met's chorus. But that is merely one of many reasons why this DVD is a recommended purchase for confirmed Mozarteans as well as lovers of great singing and drama. Each major member of this star-laden cast was essentially captured at their peak. The casting was inspired, so by a happy accident we have a nearly perfect recording of the first of the 7 great mature operas from Mozart's ""golden decade"".

Luciano Pavarotti is simply superb as Idomeneo. Everything that made him a truly great singer in his prime is in evidence here. His tone is crystalline, his Italianate phrasing is perfection as is his uncannily clear diction. Each word, sung or spoken, rings with pristine clarity, like a bell. His acting (not his usual strong suit), as a deeply troubled yet ultimately resolute Idomeneo, is as fine as I've ever seen Pavarotti act. He is obviously enjoying this part: he sang Idamante in his 1964 debut at Glyndebourne. If you've ever wondered why he became a star, it is firmly in evidence here. Frederica von Stade is a wonderful Idamante, a role originally written for a soprano castrato. She is utterly believable and her singing is excellent. Ileana Cotrubas is an inspired Ilia, mingling pathos and passion in her singing as well as acting. Hildegard Behrens is a knock-out Electra. She is a more Straussian Electra than Mozartian in her increasing madness. The rest of the cast is similarly excellent. There are no seriously weak links in this cast. James Levine and the Met Orchestra are superb, as they usually were at this time. The simple yet elegant production was designed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. This is an inspired performance of Idomeneo. One that truly merits your serious attention.

The picture format of this two DVD set is NTSC full screen shot with a 4:3 aspect ratio. The picture is digitally remastered and clear with no visual artifacts and only slight fuzziness due to the age of the tape. The region code is 0 worldwide. Menu language is English with subtitles in English, German, French, Spanish and Chinese. Sound formats are PCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Digital Surround. The sound is clear and bright with the DTS format providing great ambiance from the rear speakers, and a clarity and spatial localization of voices and instruments that imparts a feeling of ""liveness"" to the performance. Bonuses include a picture gallery and trailers from DGG. Total time of the discs is 182 minutes.

A superb performance of a Mozart masterpiece. A life enhancing DVD set that is strongly recommended.

2384329,5,B000AB4FRS,"This is an excellent video recording of a ravishing Metropolitan Opera production from 1982. All the major components of a great success are here. Fine conducting as ever from James Levine, the always excellent orchestra and chorus of the Met, stunning sets, costumes, lighting and production, and five defining performances from the lead singers.  The bouquets really must go to the ladies, all three of them in their prime, singing marvellously well and looking quite delightful.  The beautifully sung and exquisitly realised Ilia of Ileana Cotrubas is breathtakingly lovely. Every phrase seems suffused with meaning, every note with lyrical beauty. What an advantage to have a Trojan Princess of such physical grace and beauty when paired with the splendidly sung and incredibly handsome Idamante of Frederica von Stade. The two lovers duet with utter beauty and conviction providing a wonderful example of real Mozartian singing at its best. Hildegard Behrens completes the trio, an inspired piece of casting this. She looks and sounds quite (rightly) bonkers, and her awesome stage prescence, vocal power and dramatic intensity bring this lovelorn daughter of Agamemnon to intense and exciting life. John Alexander sings the hideously difficult part of Arbace with great skill and beauty and, surprisingly to me, Luciano Pavarotti sings the title role really very well. I had not considered him a natural Mozartian before, and I was charmed with his restrained and careful performance. I can't understand why this performance is not available on DVD as I gather this recording is one of the Met's biggest sellers. I live in hope.",1012521600,43,1634,5.280769230769231
2384330,2,B000AB4FRS,"It is possible that the orchestra and recording are good.  On the other hand, there is little else to recommend this production except it's being the only available VHS version of a good Mozart opera.  I found the sets distracting or annoying and the shifts in costume between prehistoric through 18th century equally so.  This opera, unlike other Mozart operas, uses the chorus to produce some of the finest music in the opera and some of Mozart's best choral music.  This production has a limp chorus from which you cannot even understand what the music is.  The main female parts, Ilia (Ileana Cortrubas) and Elettra (Hildegard Behrens) are extremely poorly sung in a very wobbly style and with very inaccurate intonation.  Idamante (Frederike von Stade) sings much more accurately but with a vibrato that is still wide enough to hide much of the vocal line.  Idomeneo (Luciano Pavarotti) is sung well enough, but this is a peculiar unsympathetic role that doesn't take full advantage of Pavarotti's strengths.  I've given my copy away and I recommend you wait for a better edition.",1000771200,10,1085,4.955801104972376
2384331,5,B000AB4FRS,"Odd that this excellent release has not received a singlereview so far.  Idomeneo is Mozart's first master opera, the first ofseven ""operatic miracles"" that he composed in the lastdecade of his life.  His early contributions to the genre are alsoextraordinary works: Il Re Pastore, Mitridate, La Finta Giardinieraetc.  But it is generally agreed that with Idomeneo he reached hismaturity as an opera composer.  It is a powerful, dense, very dramaticwork with beautiful arias.  And this is a very good rendition of thismasterwork.  I liked the set and staging and the arias are beautifullysung.  The opera is sung in the original Italian with Englishsubtitles and the synopsis provided comes in handy to understand theplot.  I always thought that James Levine definitely understandsMozart: the arias and recitatives are never too fast, the way I thinkMozart should be played, which enhances the dramatic element and thebeauty of those arias of supreme inspiration.  Ok, so I tried to fillthe gap....",977529600,44,998,5.346153846153846
2384332,5,B000AB4FRS,I love this DVD!  Not only is the opera excellent but Pavarotti's performance couldn't be topped! It is a favorite of mine and I've watched it several times already in less than the month I've owned it. Seller was excellent in getting it here ahead of schedule. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.,1369180800,,313,4.6909090909090905
2384333,3,B000AB4FRS,The opera was great. This production is awesome. Pavarotti was wonderful. ...but I gave the over all dvd 3 stars because of a flaw in the last aria by Pavarotti. It stalled and skipped. I was so disappointed because it is my favorite aria in this entire opera and I could not hear it. This was a remastered new dvd. I played it on other devices and got the same disappointing results. I did complain and was compensated minimally. I was told that a replacement dvd would not guarantee a lack of the same flaw!! So disappointing!,1312502400,3,528,4.453608247422681
2384334,5,B000AB4FRS,"Idomeneo was Mozart's first great opera. It was written for Munich, which was home to one of the finest orchestras of the day; that this fired Mozart's imagination can be heard in the very colorful orchestral writing. He was composing for excellent singers that he knew well and liked, and the lead roles are tailored to their particular skills. Mozart was also determined to elevate the stilted, formulaic opera seria for to the level of real drama, and to a large extent he succeeded. For the first time his music limns the characters with real life and personality. Mozart lavished great care on both the musical numbers and the recitative, and there is an unusually large amount of accompanied recitative, which is wonderfully flexible and expressive. There is also a move toward greater dramatic continuity; many musical numbers lead directly into the ensuing recitative without coming to a full close, a very forward-looking concept.
The opera presents two major problems for modern staging. The first is that the role of Idamante was written for a castrato, a voice type used regularly in Baroque opera, but which was already becoming rare in Mozart's time, and which we cannot begin to approximate today. The old solution for a castrato role was to transpose the music down and assign it to a male singer. In fact, Mozart did this himself. For a later Vienna production there were no adequate castrati available, and Idamante's part was rewritten for tenor. A castrato part can be taken by a countertenor in a small house, but today these parts are usually sung by women. This creates obvious problems of dramatic verisimilitude, especially since most castrato parts are heroic male characters. In this production Idamante is sung by Frederica Von Stade, who made something of a specialty of trouser roles. She sings beautifully and creates a credible character.
The second problem is that there is no definitive text for the opera. Mozart composed a great deal of music for the Munich production, but apparently he made extensive cuts in rehearsal, often sacrificing beautiful music for dramatic pacing. However, we have no record of what was actually performed. For the Vienna production further cuts and additions were made, and several arias were rewritten for different singers. For this production excellent choices were made from the available material to produce a compelling dramatic structure.
James Levine conducts very well. This first production of the opera at the Met was no doubt a labor of love, and he gives it his all. This is a big-scaled performance, scaled for dramatic impact and the size of the house. Though the camera never focuses on the orchestra, it sounds large, but there is no loss of clarity and precision. Idomeneo has the largest chorus part of any Mozart opera, and the chorus seems to enjoy itself.
Von Stade's fine performance has already been noted; the rest of the cast is at a similarly high level. Ileana Cotrubas is a lovely, lyrical Ilia. Hildegard Behrens was perhaps a strange choice for Elettra, but she brings it off well, creating a memorably half-mad character and singing with unexpected flexibility. Luciano Pavarotti seldom sang Mozart, but Idomeneo is the closest Mozart came to a dramatic tenor role, and it suits him well. He sings with his usual fine line, flawless diction, and dramatic awareness. It is unfortunate that the big aria ""Fuor del mar"" is done in the later, simplified version rather than the highly florid original, but runs were not really Pavarotti's thing. He manages the coloratura in ""Torna la pace"" but sounds less than comfortable. Arbace is seldom sung by a tenor of John Alexander's caliber, but Alexander does his best to make something interesting out of this static character. One could only wish the runs in his first aria were cleaner.
Jean-Pierre Ponelle's abstract staging works well, aside from a few weirdnesses. The giant head of Neptune that dominates the stage is very effective. The costumes are in eighteenth-century style and quite lovely.
All told, this is a powerful performance of a fascinating opera. For the best Mozart style I'd recommend the audio recording by John Eliot Gardiner, which is also finely cast and includes all the alternate versions in an appendix. The only recording I've heard with a tenor Idamante is Colin Davis's first recording, long out of print.",1307577600,10,4379,5.024759284731775
2384335,5,B000AB4FRS,I really can't imagine a better rendition of this opera nor a better cast. For me this is a dream cast. Elektra is fine and yes almost Wagnerian. Pavarotti is the best I have ever seen him both vocally and acting wise. I agree with an earlier reviewer please modernize the operas and do away with the trouser roles and use a tenor. The two soprano leads were ideally cast and what a sublime chorus and orchestra. I would venture to say that Indomeneo belongs in the top 10 opera list,1302048000,,483,4.318681318681318
2384336,5,B000AB4FRS,"This is a unique piece of history in that it is from the weeks of the first-ever performances in 1982 by the New York Metropolitan Opera of Idomeneo, perhaps Mozart's first work on the scale of grand opera.

It is also unique in that the Met ""got it right the first time"" with perhaps the best possible cast.  Here are the major roles:

Idomeneo:  Luciano Pavarotti
Idamante:  Frederica von Stade
Ilia:  Ileana Cotrubas
Elettra:  Hildegard Behrens

This work is a good illustration of the basic distinction between opera seria and opera buffa.  Mozart's later opera buffa works were written primarily to entertain.  Opera seria works told a story, here in the case of Idomeneo, that of a Greek tragedy.

The story line of Idomeneo is that, in order to be saved from a terrible sea storm, Idomeneo, the king of Crete promises Greek god Neptune that he will sacrifice the first person he meets.  Perhaps typical of Greek tragedy, that person turns out to be Idamante, Idomeneo's son.  The story is further complicated a bit by the two women who fall in love with Idamante:  Ilia, a captured Trojan princess, and Elettra, a Greek princess, the daughter of Agamemnon.

Although Idomeneo was not written to entertain in the same way as the Marriage of Figaro, Magic Flute, or Abduction from the Seraglio, those familiar with these later works will recognize precursors of some of those delightful Mozartean melodies, when they hear ""The Sea is Calm,"" an aria near the beginning of Act 2, when Elettra is getting ready to set sail.

Luciano Pavarotti was sometimes criticized for putting most of his energies into singing rather than his acting.  Not so here!  Near the end of Act 2 we hear Luciano furiously challenging Neptunre to take his life and spare innocent victims.  Pavarotti's eyes (perhaps with the added assistance of Met lighting master, Gil Wechsler) seem to shoot out lightning bolts, just as Zeus himself might do.

Ileana Cotrubas takes her turn at impassioned singing and acting as Act 3 begins, with her beautiful ""Mozartean-just-right"" bel canto plea to the flowers and breezes to tell her beloved of her love.

So, what Idomeneo lacks in later Mozartean slapstick or comical characters, it does offer a chance to hear Mozart's developing creative genius paired with perhaps the greatest tenor ever--Pavarotti--at his very best--which is high praise indeed.",1264982400,6,2372,4.954430379746835
2384337,5,B000AB4FRS,"After reading the reviews already submitted, I can limit myself to an enthusiastic second for Birman and Linton. They say better and in more detail exactly what I would like to say. This is a classy performance in which all the stars and featured players earned high marks for their contribution to the unified group effort and James Levine showed what an orchestra sounds like when it is sharing the spotlight not dominating it.
I have seen the DVD of only one other performance, that in the Mozart 22 box set with Magdalena Kozena, Anja Harteros, Ekaterina Siurina, and Ramon Vargas. On no element of staging and performance is it in the same league with the Mets version.(To  be fair, there are astute reviewers who hold the reverse opinion. )",1235260800,8,746,4.7384615384615385
2384338,5,B000AB4FRS,"A beautiful performance of Idomeneo.  Pavarotti is marvelous, so are Frederica von Stade and Hildegard Behrens.

2384340,4,B000AB4FRS,"Mozart's ""Idomeneo"", first composed in 1780 had to wait until 1947 to receive its first US premiere at Tanglewood in the Berkshires, and then wait another 35-years before receiving its official welcome at the Met on October 14, 1982 - which is the tape date of this new release from Deutsche Grammophon, on a digitalized 2-DVD package. With a cast featuring Pavarotti, singing the role of Idomeneo ( the father who offers a sacrifice of the first life he encounters if the gods will spare him from the fate of an angry sea), Frederica von Stade, singing the role of his son Idamante (the first person he encounters) (I don't know why the Met cast a woman in the son's role, since even Mozart saw fit to change the role of son from castrato to tenor in 1786), Ileana Cotrubas singing the role of Trojan princess Illia, and Hildegard Behrens, singing the role of Princess Elattra. It is a powerhouse cast that delivers mesmerizing performances to some of Mozart's most poignant and subtle, full and supportive music. It is a joy to hear and a pleasure to watch - even with a few shortfalls in the manner of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's somewhat drab settings and dark lighting. Another small minus is the aged "":full screen"" as opposed to contemporary ""widescreen"" presentation. Still, watching this cast perform is its own reward. The digital audio simply enhances the sound of the Met orchestra, and James Levine delivers a solid lead with decisive shading that is perfectly matched to the size and sound of the ensemble cast on stage - whether solo or chorus. This is a worthwhile DVD to own, and not the least of which reason for owning it is the pleasure of watching Pavarotti's hypnotic magic and natural performance and movement on stage.

2384341,3,B000AB4FRS,"Well, I cannot explain why I insisted in buying this DVD. I knew the main singers here are not Mozart specialists.
Pavarotti doesn't know what style is, although always delivers an excellent vocal performance. He slightly portrays Idomeneo here...what a miracle!
I won't comment all the singers...
The deception here comes with the role of Elletra sung by a guttural Hildegard Behrens, who is not well fit to italian roles, and shouts a magnificent Wagner...
She just destroys this role with her glottal attacks, always gargling marbles, destroying the coloratura, especially at the aria ""D'Oreste, d'Ajace"". She doesn't have full command of italian, and hardly knows what dicction means...
Illeana Cotrubas as Ilia is a joke. She shakes all the time...she must have been retired instead...What a wobble!
Anyway, I recommend it to those who are opera fanatics and collectors. The staging, costumes, scenic conception are excellent, though. And there are singers like Pavarotti and Von Stade to minor these shortcomings...",1150243200,28,1021,5.3478260869565215

8077545,4,B000AB4FRS,"This is a very well-conducted (Levine), well-staged (Ponelle) and well-directed (Large) version of Idomeneo.  The highlight for me is the Met Chorus, who blow the doors off at the end of Act 1 and are otherwise superb.

Five stars for me mean that it is a definitive performance.  That simply can't be the case here.  The production has one disqualifying characteristic: the casting of Luciano Pavarotti as Idomeneo.  His voice is fine; he executes his arias perfectly well; I don't care about criticisms of his acting.  The problem is that his inability to execute runs and trills means that he uses the simplified version of the Act 2 aria ""Fuor del Mar"".  This isn't nitpicking.  This aria to this opera is what ""Der Hlle Rache"" is to the Flute.  It's the centrepiece, composed by Mozart as a showcase for the tenor Anton Raaff.  The simplified version is empty. It lays bare the casting of Pavarotti as a crowd-puller.  It would have worked fine in New York in the 1980s, when Idomeneo was barely known.  $$$$$.  But do you reckon the Salzburg Festival would try the same thing today? Of course not.

For that reason it's four, not five, stars: it's perfectly good, but the world is probably still awaiting the definitive staged-to-screen Idomeneo.",1440806400,2,1252,4.816901408450704

I would prefer a male tenor to Fredrica von Stada playing the part of Idomeneo's son. But, she did a great job. Behrens' voice is more suitable for Wagner, but she was more than adequate in the part of Electra and her acting was great. This is an older production and some of the newer producers should take note that operas are best when they adhere to the traditional settings. I have become more critical of buying operas, even ones I would like to see performed, because they set the story in modern settings that make no sense to the story. There is another Idomeneo done at Glyndborne with Barstow as Electra which I would also recommend. But, looking at the two productions, there are different operatic cuts. Both are very good and recommended.",1421539200,2,866,4.666666666666667
8077548,3,B000AB4FRS,"There are good reasons why this opera is ""not well known"" and ""rarely performed"".  It's stilted, emotionally rarely engaging and just uninteresting too much of the time.  Having sopranos pretend they're princes isn't additive, but it would bother me less if I cared about the characters, which I really didn't.  Pavarotti sang well, but his role is so small (perhaps 15% of a 3+ hour opera) that his strengths fell short of offsetting other weaknesses.  The 4:3 format makes subtitle viewing a challenge on the newest HD TV's no matter which zoom/display-format settings you select.  I'll keep the DVD only because of Pavarotti.
