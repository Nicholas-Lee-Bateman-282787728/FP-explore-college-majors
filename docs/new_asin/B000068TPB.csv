1726343,4,B000068TPB,"Let's see: a 'geeky' guy is on some sports team that REALLY needs to win. He also has this unpopular girl as his friend (who happnes to have a crush on him), and has a crush on the most beautiful & popular girl in school, who couldn't care less about him. Suddenly, the guy discovers he had inherited the family 'curse' - he is a werewolf. After the initial scare, he finds out he can use it to his advantage - he helps his sports team win, which makes him popular, which attracts the beautiful & popular girlfriend, which makes her boyfriend (who is, incidentaly, on the opposite team) mad, which leads to a big fight, which leads our protagonist to the conclusion that he had abused his power as a werewolf and the importance of team work. This leads to a confrontation with some sort of an authority figure, but eventually the team (lead and inpired by the protagonist) wins the day, and the guy gets together with the geeky girl he discovers he liked all along.
Since this can describe both the movies, the unoriginal & repeated story line is the biggest fault I could find with the Teen Wolf 2 movie. OK, that and the fact Michael J. Fox (who made the most of the 1st film) wasn't in it.
These are typical early tot mid 80's teen dramas, and the fun in them (at least for me) is the memories rather than the story and the laughs. And oh yeah, Michael J. Fox.",1068768000,,1363,4.307392996108949
1726344,5,B000068TPB,"lets face it Teen Wolf is a great movie but the best part of it, i mean the glue that keeps it together is my man styles. If you want to land some hot babes and mc some killer keg partys take a few pointers from the lord of the gravel pit.teal blue pants,red t shirt and green mesh head wear never looked so good. I can only plead to Styles (Jerry Levine)bring this guy back for a movie of his own since you were replaced with some lame imitator for teen wolf 2. i just saw Jason vs. Freddy but i have a good idea Styles vs. Stifler, what do you say lets get this one made already.",1068163200,2,581,3.8907563025210083

1726346,3,B000068TPB,Teen Wolf is one of those comedies that people often forget about. IT stars Michael J. Fox as the wolf.  I liked this movie  thanks to Michael J. Fox he makes the movie if you put someone else in his shoes that wasn't a known actor it wouldn't be as good.  He was making Back to the Future at the time when this came out and Family ties so people knew who he was.  The movie is still pleasent at best. I always liked Teen Wolf since I was a little kid watching it on T.V. and then I bought the tape it was one of those goodtimes tapes that weren't that good.  I was happy when the DVD came out what a difference compared to the old beat up tape the picture is great on the DVD it's even in widescreen.  There is hardly any special features just a trailer.  They should of put special feaures on the other side of the disc and take out Teen wolf Too.  The original Teen wolf is still the best.  If you have the old paramount tape or goodtimes it's worth getting this movie on DVD. MGM took it over so it's the property of MGM.,1030665600,3,1025,3.985294117647059
1726347,4,B000068TPB,"The only reason I'm not giving This forthcoming DVD five stars is that it's paired with the sequel, which is better left in the vaults of the MIB.  The original is, simply put, a masterpiece that transcends the genre of teen movies.  It takes the clever idea of using lycanthropy as a coming of age symbol and plays it out beautifully.  Michael J. Fox is at his best, and the rest of the cast compliment with excellent chemistry.  It's just as fun to watch the tenth time around as the first; I'm finding myself memorizing and quoting it like Star Wars.  The sequel does it no justice.  Jason Bateman does OK, but the script was too much an attempt to duplicate the original, while the first movie clearly broke ground.",1029456000,3,719,4.492307692307692
1726348,5,B000068TPB,"Well, sir, the time has come and now I'm waiting for the apocalypse.  Yes, it's true: Teen Wolf is out on DVD.  Beware the juggernaut.
While I've nothing positive to say about TWT (Teen Wolf Too), the original is simply breathtaking.  MJF (Michael J. Fox) gives a measured, taut performance as the title character.  Oh, what a dream!
But the supporting cast really carries the picture.  The flair of Styles sparkles, the Spanish of Coach makes us nod in agreement, the Locke-esque pompousness of Mick makes us grit our teeth, the girth of Chubs reminds of Phi-Phi girls, and even that old coger the principal causes us to clench our fist and want to give him the business.
How does MJF (Michael J. Fox) overcome it all?  By becoming a sort of beast-hound, he is able to look into the soul of the universe, and eventually, into the soul of the treacherous Pamela Wells.  Stick with Booth, MJF!

1726349,3,B000068TPB,"MGM FINALLY bought the rights to TEEN WOLF and TEEN WOLF TOO
It's a lot of fun to watch Michael J. Fox in this film. The movie has some chuckles and it makes you feel good in the end.
Unfortunately, this DVD is going to be packed with the abysmal TEEN WOLF TOO which is almost like going to a great club with a really hot date to have some fun but having this dorky guy following you around that you can't get rid of EVER.
I also hope that MGM does this right and includes some small but fun special features. Not a documentary so much but a small featurette and the ""shot-for-T.V.-only"" scenes such as Scott getting chased by a pack of dogs down the street after speaking to Boof. That'll do in my book.
--Matt
Please note: I do not rate this movie along my ""real movie"" scale. TEEN WOLF by NO means, is as good as CASTAWAY or anything else I gave three stars.",1023148800,,861,4.130952380952381
1726350,5,B000068TPB,"Teen Wolf is a true 80's classic!  Michael J Fox was one of the top actors of the 80's, so you know that Teen Wolf is gonna be great, regardless!  The plot, characters, and the music was all great!  It is about an average guy who doesn't wanna be average.  He gets his wish and then has to deal with it.  (Like how too much of one thing can go bad.)  I really think the ending is great and leaves you with the completion that movies are suppose to.
Teen Wolf Too is a typical sequal.  (Really bad.)  They tried to recycle too much of the original movie just to punch out a sequal.
I mean it's nice that you have 2 movies in one, but Teen Wolf is by far the best!  And right now it's at a very reasonable price!  So be sure to get yours today!",1022889600,3,742,3.9194630872483223

The only redeeming factor was that Scott's dad was in the sequel, albeit for 5 minutes and his van was a different make.  Michael J nailed the first one.  The acting was superb, the story relatable to the 80s teen generation and even the music rocked.  Plus, there's Pamela who's hot but a brat and then there's Nick who's 40 but still plays high school b-ball.  Go figure.

1726482,4,B000068TPB,"Well, if you're looking for a nice 80s cult classic, ""Teen Wolf"" will deliver. It's an interesting spin on ""The Wolf Man."" Michael J. Fox portrays the interesting aspects of an underdog high school student who is first annoyed by his condition, then enjoys it, and then develops too much of an ego, and then comes back to center.

I feel obligated to mention Michael J. Fox's 2 friends Boof and Styles. Boof is convincing as the 'not most sought after girl,' but the one a sane man would feel better about going out with (as opposed to the official hottest girl) Pam. Styles is likable as the guy always looking to make a few extra dollars.

And of course Mr. Hampton is really likable as Michael's father. (He not only has knowledge of the condition, but he offers insight, and even some profound moments when he explains a moment when he was more frightened than the man he fought with.)

It's probably not Michael J. Fox's most famous movie, but it's worth a watch.

Fox, but did not get that much of a bang out of it. The strangest thing about both films is that the subject of the werewolf is treated so casually, just like a case of a five-o-clock shadow that increases your popularity at school.

1726493,5,B000068TPB,"Here's a pairing of two rather unique movies on a dual-side DVD, the original Teen Wolf staring Michael J. Fox and its less-successful sequel, Teen Wolf Too with Jason Bateman.  The first film deals with the struggles of Scott Howard, a high school student fed up with being average, until he discovers he's inherited a fantastic gift; moments of heightened emotional state transform him into The Wolf.  The real problem is how he lets it affect his social life, his academic life and his athletic life . . . and what he has to do to overcome the problem.

Teen Wolf Too is the lesser-known story of a cousin named Todd Howard trying to cope with the pressures of being a college freshman, tied in with an unexpected athletic responsibility (as a boxer) and the burden of living up to the events of the previous story.  He thinks he didn't receive the capacity to turn into a wolf the way Scott did, and he's completely surprised to discover that The Wolf is a part of him.  Not only does being the wolf help Todd to excel in the ring, but he gets stuck up and allows the same things to happen to himself that happened to Scott.

When I first saw this DVD package, I didn't even know about Teen Wolf Too.  When I watched Too, I did enjoy it a good deal.  At the same time, I have to admit to knowing what prevented it from being more commercially successful.  People had already seen much of that film's turns of events in the original (down to Jason Bateman's voice turning demonic in the registrar's office, something which happened with Fox).  One key element that differs from the original film is that Todd Howard's biology professor is highly supportive of Todd, even when his performance plummets.  Her secret is revealed to the dean near the end of the film - that The Wolf is also a part of her.

Another difference is that, when the original was produced, the songs woven into the score were all composed by film scorer Miles Goodman and lyricist Douglas Brayfield (save the Beach Boys' ""Surfin' USA"").  Teen Wolf Too depended more heavily on non-original music than on its own score.

The significance of these two films being packaged together lies largely in the show, Family Ties, in which Jason Bateman's older sister, Justine starred as one of Michael J. Fox' sisters.  Jason was also a cast member of Little House on the Prairie at the close of Season 7 and during all Season 8; boss and star Michael Landon also starred in I was a Teenage Werewolf in 1957.  (In addition, five years previous to the original Teen Wolf, Michael J Fox had debuted in the Disney film Midnight Madness with David Naughton, who reached worldwide acclaim in An American Werewolf in London during 1981.)",1232668800,,2697,4.575883575883576

1726497,5,B000068TPB,"I can't understand why you people HATE Teen Wolf Too!!  Jason Bateman TRULY SHINES in his acting ability and title role in this flick.  He's an outstanding actor who should've made more movies in the 80's, not just been on sitcoms!  I have just finished watching ""TWT"" and well deserves more praise than what he's gotten in the past!  The story goes as Todd Howard (Jason Bateman) is about to enter college where he finds himself turning into a wolf and has a personality change because of it.  He falls in love with a girl who helps him realize that he just needs to be himself and to forget about being a wolf.  In time he realizes that his girlfriend is right and the fight scene at the end is where he truly decides that anything is possible without a split personality.

I've seen the first Teen Wolf with Michael J Fox and I don't find it as good as the second.  I don't know why there was never a Teen Wolf 3 with more of Jason Bateman!!!  I highly recommend this to all Jason Bateman fans (like myself) who want to watch a good 80's movie.  Oh, and Jason,  you were GREAT in Silver Spoons and in ""It's Your Move"".

1726498,3,B000068TPB,"I would recommend getting the DVD if you just are looking for great picture quality and sound. There are no bonus features.

I have a question. From what I understand, those extra scenes where MJF was chased by dogs and talks with his dad after the dance were shot for airing the movie on television to replace a couple of racy scenes(the marijuana scene and the sexual scene between Scott and Pamela). But I saw a rerun of this movie recently on a small local affiliate channel (not even a cable channel, mind you) and the racy scenes were shown and the extra scenes were not(??). So, I'm confused as to how to get a version of the movie with those scenes in it. My guess is that you can't find them on any VHS release (the DVD definitely doesn't have them).

So what I'm asking is: Would the only way to see those replacement scenes be if you recorded the movie off a television broadcast? I mean, I did that, but the scenes still weren't shown. Does it really just come down to the decision of the particular channel airing that movie? So, if they edit the marijuana and sexual scenes, that's when they'd show the dog chase and after-dance conversation scenes? So you can only see them by pure chance?",1191456000,2,1204,4.418918918918919

But if you want to get the original Teen Wolf, you might as well get both at time for basically the same price.  And for the reviewer that was wondering why Michael J Fox made this movie after a successful Back To The Future movie, the reason is this.  He actually was shooting Teen Wolf before he got the part for B2TF.  But Teen Wolf actually came out after B2TF, even though he filmed before.  SO despite being on TV, Fox wasn't a movie star yet.  But Teen Wolf is one of those fun 80's movies that has a nostalgic feeling.  Yes, there are tons of plot holes, but who cares?  If you haven't seen this movie, you probably won't like it as much as those of us who watched it when it first came out.  And if you have seen it, get it.  Just Teen Wolf Too once for a good laugh and then avoid it like the plague.

1726505,2,B000068TPB,"I remembered thinking at the time when the first Teen Wolf movie was released what an odd movie that was for Michael J Fox to have appeared in.  He was riding high from the success of the first Back To The Future movie plus he was already cemented in his TV success of Family Ties.  I realize now that they released this otherwise dud to profit from these things, and it worked as this movie had a healthy turn out when it otherwise wouldn't have.

Michael J Fox plays Scott, a lovable Joe Average high schooler who is frustrated with his status in life.  He plays on a basketball team that never wins (and if they're incorporating players 5 feet tall or shorter, why would they win?), has a crush on the prettiest girl in school who never gives him the time of day, wants to purchase at the liquor store but can never get past the crotchety old fart behind the counter.  And he's fed up.  He wants a change, but he gets far more than he barganed for.  One night after a party, Scott changes into a werewolf.  He discovers that his father is one as well and adding to his further gawky adjustment he had this to contend with as well.  Once this is discovered at school, he becomes an instant celebrity and popular.  The people don't like Scott, they only like his wolf persona, he learns a lesson to appreciate only the more genuine people (pushing aside pretty princess Pamela for Boof, his longtime friend) and how shallow and unrewarding being his popular self was.

It was an ok story, but it had been done hundreds of times before and since.  The make up job they did on Michael J Fox was wonderful, especially the total body, but he came off looking more cute than scary.  I was expecting hideous but it was trying to get scared by the Easter Bunny.  I disliked this movie so intensely because of Pamela, the gal he was hot for.  From the moment she was introduced she was an absolute shrew and wondered why he would ever give a vain, narcistic princess like her the time of day.  And her boyfriend!  He was borderline bipolar!  But then again, why would he (let alone anyone in real life) go for someone who is actually a good person rather than a complete jerk?  Tis the Bad Boy/Girl syndrome.  The best part of this movie was his wacky sidekick Styles.  All of his hairbrained schemes backfired or went a little south, his T shirts were raunchy and nasty, and he was the life of the party wherever they went.  They made just an ok buddy comedy duo, as Michael J Fox was far too stiff to be a good strait man against him.  It was also disappointing that they didn't utilize Styles more.

The lesson here is the that power corrupts.  Once MJF was given the keys to the kingdom, he abused his new power until he was cut down and made to feel a fool.  He got all the new attention from those he wished he could impress, then finds out they are terrible people after all.  And that woman he wished he could have Pamela?  Nothing but a gold digging, power hungry social climber.  He does, rather predictably, make the right choices in the end, but it's still a good and appropriate lesson we have to learn no matter what the case may be.

And Teen Wolf II?  Oh, that just gave me a migraine.  It was the exact same movie except it took place in college and the sport was boxing rather than basketball.  And Jason Bateman is right on!  He plays a goofy voice of reason on a clever show today, Arrested Developement, but his talent was wasted on this tripe.

So, one night, when he's at a party with his best friends Boof and Styles, something odd happens to Scott. As if he didn't have enough problems...guess what? He's turning into a werewolf! Now Scott has to make sure he can keep his secret! He makes sure to avoid classmates and friends, as well as vice principal Rusty Thorne (who has a grudge against Scott's father, Harold Howard)!

Jerry Levine's agent should have parlayed Levine's role here into a comedy career for Levine, but that never happened.  Michael J. Fox gives a typical performance, but it's affecting, and sincere.  The basketball scenes are hysterical, particularly in light of his lack of height and basketball skills.  The supporting cast is good, with Styles leading the way as top WOLF BUDDY.

1726517,4,B000068TPB,"I love this release from MGM to release movies like this as a double feature (2 movies on one disc). I loved the first movie starring Michael J Fox as Scott Howard, a complete looser in high school on a struggling basketball team who one night inherits the family genes and discovers he is a werewolf. And finds out that werewolves aren't like they have been portrayed in movies, but have some great powers.

Teen Wolf Too starring Jason Bateman is one I used to watch as a kid. But then seeing it again I released it wasn't a great movie, tho it's not that bad, I think it gets stinking reviews because it's not M.J.F in it, instead it is supposed to be Scott's cousin, Todd Howard. I think the only mistake they made was trying to pass off 2 new and totally different actors to play the roles of Styles & The Couch. But over all, I think the movie was ok, it was not as good as the first, and was basically the same plot as the first one, but in the boxing field instead of Basketball and much the same things happening as in the 1st movie, but if you give it a ago, I'm sure everyone has seen worse movies before. It has copped a pretty bad rep for a while, but is it really so bad? It's just a movie for fun. And I think the soundtrack is pretty good for part 2.

But I do admit, I think the only way MGM would have gotten this sequel to sell if they put it on DVD would be how they have done it here as a double feature on a flip side disc. If they sold them individually, Teen Wolf Too would in the 20 cent bin eventually and still wouldn't have been picked up and even looked at much. But please, give it a go, it's really not so bad, it's ok for a sequel, could've been worse.

I'd have loved to see a 3rd Sequel for Teen Wolf. I always believe if you make a 2nd one, make a 3rd to round it off nicely, even if it's a bad, bad film, take Robocop 3 for example. There was a Teen Wolf ""cartoon"" made with both the teens Scott and Todd in it, I think? Maybe that would be an idea for a 3rd sequel. Or maybe get in Michael Jackson to star in it, he wouldn't require make up!!! Oh, no wait...sorry, that's monkeys from ""Planet of the apes"" I was thinking of, not Werewolves. Maybe someday we will see Teen Wolf 3, maybe little Bart might actually play the role, who knows? But for now, these 2 movies are available on the same flip side disc at a great price, there's no bonus features, but having both movies is good enough for me.",1107475200,,2435,4.037267080745342
