The title says BETTY BOOP 8 FULL LENGTH EPISODES 8 SHOWS ON 1 DVD. If you are like me, then you'll be under the impression you are getting 8 Betty Boop cartoons. This is NOT so! The first 5 are indeed Boop but the last 3 are various other cartoons. This DVD contains:
1 Henry - Betty leaves Henry in charge of her pet shop
2 Another Little King - The King joins Betty in her show
3 No! No! No! A Thousand Times No! - Someone attempts to woo Betty away from Freddie
4 Making Stars - Betty showcases future stars in her show
5 Is My Palm Read - Betty visits the fortune teller
6 Parrotville Old Folks - A cartoon about parrots
7 Happy Harmonies - An MGM cartoon about Spring
8 A Day At The Zoo - An a.a.p Merrie Melodies cartoon (Incidentally, this was the funniest out of all on this DVD)

This is a basic DVD that comes in a cardboard sleeve (i.e. no artwork), also there is no real 'Menu' to speak of...it just leads in to the list of the 8 cartoons. There is no 'Play All' option so you have to play each one individually. The sound is crisp and clear and the picture is as clear as it can be considering the age of the films. You DO however get the ""film look"" - the hairlines and black dots that appear from time to time throughout old films. Gives it that nostalgic feeling I think.

I decided to place this on here because considering that I felt cheated of 3 cartoons, I can't imagine it will be better on the second DVD. Hope this helps.",1208822400,,1534,4.072847682119205
