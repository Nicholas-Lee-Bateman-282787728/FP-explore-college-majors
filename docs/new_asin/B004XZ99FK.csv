4498500,1,B004XZ99FK,This is the same movie with a different title ---- the previous one was billed as a zombie flick. tortured or some such.,1351468800,,120,4.260869565217392
4498501,2,B004XZ99FK,"""Psychopaths Sex With Hostages"" and ""Tortured"" are both the exact same movie only with different titles.  The only real difference between the two is that ""Tortured"" has about 5 Minutes of Zombies at the beginning of the movie after the woman who gets raped and killed comes back to life after her dead body comes into contact with toxic waste.  I'm guessing if your looking at this review, then you aren't looking for a movie that's going to win an Academy Award your looking for something that has no socialy redeeming qualities what so ever.  The scenes that lead up to the sex scene are boring make little or no sense and will cause you to fast forward through them (plus the thick British accents make the dialog difficult to understand).  The rape/sex scene (again the same scene in both movies), is graphic and violent. In many of the movies that you will buy on Amazon, the woman's ""sensitive area"" is blured out or something blocks the view of it, not the case with this movie, the woman's legs are spead wide by the rapist and the camera zooms in as she is raped with a gun.",1347667200,31,1084,4.4873096446700504
4498502,1,B004XZ99FK,"Don't waste your money.  As you probably suspect it's a piece of crap full of empty dialogue in scenes that contribute nothing to the plot (if there was a plot--I was too bored to find it). The women are all retreads with about as much sex appeal as, well, used tires.  There is a rape scene at the end--but you're the one who'll be raped.  It always amazes me that morons have the ability to scrape up enough money to make such films.",1347148800,7,435,4.216867469879518

4498511,1,B004XZ99FK,"According to IMDB the director of this abomination, Jason Impey, has made 77 movies since 2000! Of the three I've tried to watch, none of them is of any value, Acting and dialogue are appalling and if you are a gorehound and expect that, at least there will be some good gore you'll be very disappointed. The gore on display is amateurish beyond belief. Compared to Jason Impey the much maligned Ed Wood could be considered to be Ingmar Bergman.",1404864000,2,445,4.575

4498513,1,B004XZ99FK,Just not very good in anyway shape or form. The concept was decent other than that I do not have anything good to say.,1396051200,,118,3.9583333333333335
4498514,3,B004XZ99FK,"Basic plot, and decent acting throughout. Good price & quality. It is entertaining in its concept, but is missing something.",1382054400,,124,5.25
4498515,4,B004XZ99FK,"Worth it, especially for the most disturbing rape scene I've ever scene. It was so terribly fascinating. One of those scenes that live in infamy and will continue to randomly pop into your mind now & then. So basically you'll be a bit traumatized...but all in the spirit of good horror flick fun. ;) The story surrounding the denouement was interesting & the characters entertaining. This is one of those movies where you find yourself rooting for the least worst character...because neither main character is a good guy. It'll make you question yourself a bit. Good stuff.",1374969600,5,573,4.917525773195877
4498516,4,B004XZ99FK,I see some peeps hating on this movie which is too bad cause I thought it was pretty kickin. Fairly disturbing at points but I'll watch it again sometime for sure,1374710400,3,162,4.258064516129032

4498519,4,B004XZ99FK,"Let's get it straight, this is not a movie to be picked apart by film students. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. If you are looking for some good b movie action then this is your ticket. Drive in fans will love this.",1362355200,2,227,4.181818181818182

4498522,3,B004XZ99FK,"First and foremost, in the spirit of honesty, I must admit that I was under the influence of medical marijuana when I watched this film.
The plot of Psychopaths basically consisted of 5 people, A corrupt cop; his by the books partner; 2 escaped rapists and a rape victim. The story line didn't have much consistency, the biggest issue is the two rapists seemed to be getting their roles reversed with each other quite a bit. For example, one of them keeps a ""bad guy"" persona the whole way through, while the other one switches from nice guy to bad guy more often then a psycho who's bi-polar.
Towards the end the ""bad guy"" rapist (and this may very well be due to my intoxication) disappears from the film without an explanation leaving the other to deal with the pursuit by the cops. He is beaten extremely badly and shot, but manages to jump right up as if nothing was wrong in one last attempt to kill his adversary.
The exploitation in the film is relatively good, but there are many missed opportunities.
With the shoty storyline, deplorable acting, and other many problems; one might wonder why I give it 3 stars. Well there are some great nude seens (especially the shower seen, and the rape seen in the woods was one of the best ones I've seen in a ""main stream"" indi movie.

8447688,1,B004XZ99FK,"Two escaped criminals decide they want a woman to rape...technically not a hostage as they have no demands. The cops looking for them aren't much better than the criminals.

This appears to be  a poorly restored film. There is a line that constantly goes down the left side of the screen. There are scenes that are blurred with yellow ""X"" marks in them. The flashback scenes aren't exciting and there is really just one graphic rape porn scene in the film about an hour into it. Not too much sex with hostages. The film attempts to make an argument for the death penalty.",1446422400,,571,4.533980582524272

8447692,2,B004XZ99FK,"If you're expecting truly 'psycho' psycopaths, this film is rather a let down.  The two psycho main characters spend most of the picture putting each other down or trying to 'psycho'-analyze each other.  Definitely not Norman Bates level of psycho - and if you were hoping for Texas Chainsaw with a British accent, forget it.  Kind of a overly-chatty let-down.",1436832000,,360,4.966666666666667
