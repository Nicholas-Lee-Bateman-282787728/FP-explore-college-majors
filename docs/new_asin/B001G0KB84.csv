3589775,5,B001G0KB84,Players from the Dominican Republic looking to rise out of poverty and help their families. Features a pair of players in their quest to make it to the majors. Also looks at the origins of such all-stars as David Ortiz and Vladimir Guerrero.,1369526400,,241,4.627906976744186
3589776,5,B001G0KB84,"I liked all of the boys and their cheerful determination to make it to the big show and improve life for themselves and their families.  It is sad, however, to realize that very few will succeed.  Their incredible baseball talent won't take them to a college for a degree to fall back on and succeed in a career.  This story reminds me of ""Hoop Dreams"".  In very few cases will there be a happy ending.",1368921600,,402,4.32
3589777,3,B001G0KB84,"This was a short and entertaining documentary, but was limited in describing the big picture. It could have gone further in defining and explaining the breadth of MLB involvement in the country, the DR's own professional league structure, and given a more well rounded perspective of the country's culture.",1365379200,,306,5.26530612244898
3589778,5,B001G0KB84,"This is a great documentary. I really loved it. I used to play baseball in Dominica Republic but stopped playing, which I will regret for ever. If you are a fan of baseball and think those guys make too much money, watch this documentary. Oh man, I loved this. I love baseball with passion. I wish the day I go to heaven I play baseball for ever. The story that made me the saddest, is the one about Rafael Furcal's cousin. That just breaks my heart. Let me not spoil it for you.

Get it and enjoy it.",1286668800,,501,4.112244897959184
3589779,5,B001G0KB84,"We've all heard about how many good ballplayers come from the Dominican.  Here's an inside look at what it's like to be a kid with a chance to make it.  It was very real and very interesting.  The stories from Vlad Guerrero and David Ortiz were good, especially Big Papi's hilarious description of what they used in place of a ball for stickball - and how they got it.  I highly recommend this film.",1275609600,,399,4.351351351351352
