8324304,2,B0007WCA2C,"Was expecting more of the great things about Montgomery Clift (his acting approach and preparation, working relationships with theater/film professionals, et.al). What I viewed was more of the same: his drug/alcohol problems, sexual confusion and so forth. Not much to recommend here...",1305072000,,286,5.833333333333333
8324305,5,B0007WCA2C,"This is the essential documentary for any Montgomery Clift fan. Unfortunately it is a VHS and not a DVD, what is an inconvenient. In spite of it, it is really worth buying it. It tells everything you could possible want to know about the most handsome and talented Hollywood actor ever. Friends and family tell us about their moments with Monty, both the good and the bad times:childhood, holidays, films,health problems... They do not skip the hard and painful issues,without becoming gossipy and sensationalist.
There is also a good collection of personal pictures included, revealing a new Monty that we had never seen before. His life is narrated with a deeply moving and extremely nice background music.
In short: I have really enjoyed this documentary and recommend it to everyone interested in this Hollywood legend.",1209427200,4,823,5.103703703703704
