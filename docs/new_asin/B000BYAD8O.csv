2446765,5,B000BYAD8O,"Someone described Bill's albums to me in terms of Beatles output.....""Dangerous"" was a powerful start (""Please Please Me/With The Beatles""), ""Relentless"" was more polished, (""Hard Day's Night/Rubber Soul"") then came the masterwork  of ""Arizona Bay"" (""Revolver/Pepper""), and the extraordinary and disparate finish of Rant In E Minor (""White Album"").

In these terms, ""Sane Man"" is ""Live At The Star Club (Hamburg)"" or ""The Beatles At The Beeb"". It the provocative prototype of what was to come, none the less important than what was to follow. The solid underwork of a magnificent career to come....

I don't think the comparison to the world most important band ever is overstreching, either. He was the rock and roll comedian, and he was that good!

""Sane Man"" is unmissable for any Hicks devotee. The funniest man of my generation.",1132531200,16,833,5.148148148148148
2446766,5,B000BYAD8O,"This is the show that really got me interested in Bill. I had seen him on Letterman a few times, and remembered him when I saw a brief notice of his death on the news. Shortly thereafter, I saw a copy of ""Sane Man"" at the local video store. It stood out on the shelf, because it was clearly homemade. It had a photocopied cover, and stark black-on-white lettering label.

Watching it was a revelation. My roomate and I had never seen such a powerful, yet silly performance. The picture was terrible, clearly taken from a 3/4"" Umatic tape or worse, but the message was clear.

I tried to get the store to order me a copy, but they didn't know how. The tape had been sent to them by their corporate office. (The chain was based in Texas.) This was pre-internet, so I figured if they couldn't get it, no one could. So I rented it again and bootlegged it. I still have that tape.

A few years ago, Kevin Booth released an extended cut of ""Sane Man"", but only on VHS. The picture quality was also rumored to be improved. But I wanted to hold out for a DVD. And now it's finally here. And knowing Rykodisc, probably greatly improved. They've only let us down once before. (The ""Love Laughter & Truth"" CD was scraping the bottom of the Hicks kettle.)

But even if this is a VHS copied onto a DVD, it's worth it. Most people have simply never seen this performance. The ""Bill Hicks Satirist..."" DVD was great, but it didn't have the fire of this performance. In ""One Night Stand"" and ""Relentless"", he's confident, but he's trying to prove himself. In ""Revelations"", he's a little TOO cool, since he was a genuine star in London by this time. (Plus, there's a bit too much ""british-centric"" humor."")

""Sane Man"" is a younger Bill in front of a home-town crowd. It's true this tape was intended as a ""demo"" for an HBO or Showtime special. But while his actual HBO special years later was relatively dialed down, this is the full-on, frightening  Bill Hicks heard on parts of ""Rant In E Minor"" and ""Flying Saucer Tour 1"". And yet, his silly side is more on display here too. It's the best of both Bills.

And you know his ""lone gunman"" show closer? I've never seen it done better than on ""Sane Man"".

Hopefully, Ryko will include some extras...maybe ""Ninja Bachelor Party"" in it's entirity? (The original tape included a trailer for it. I've seen it since, and it's awful, but it would be fun to have as an extra.)",1131926400,27,2403,4.420814479638009
2446787,5,B000BYAD8O,this is the first fully taped standup of hicks. . . right at the time his career was starting to take off. i recommend this as a must have for any comedy fan. . .and most certainly any hicks fan. one of the best comedians/philosophers to ever live.,1322956800,,248,4.1875
2446788,4,B000BYAD8O,"Have you ever had that experience where you're watching a DVD of something you're a fan of when suddenly your girlfriend/ housemate walks in and wants to watch it with you? All of a sudden you realise that what you're watching is an acquired taste, and is not necessarily for general consumption.

I would love to say that this DVD is for all tastes and is full of undiscovered gems. Unfortunately (if you've seen most of Bill's other stuff) it is not, although you will discover some interesting material which is not on the other DVD's (e.g. the George Michael routines and Bill's Elvis impersonation).

Even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essential-Collection/dp/B003WR9N6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essential Collection</a>&nbsp;covers a lot of similar material to this, this DVD still has some worthwhile material for us fans, including a performance from the underground show 'Outlaws Get Religion'. The routines seem to plug the gap left between his early performances (1982-1984) and his post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Relentless/dp/B0040IR0HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Relentless</a>&nbsp;stuff.

Two things to bear in mind though.

First 80% of the material he performs is similar to his later stuff and even the DVD admits it is Bill's later work 'in embryonic form' (e.g. the vulgar 'Dick Clark' routine became the 'Rush Limbaugh' routine on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rant-in-E-Minor/dp/B0000009QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rant in E-Minor</a>).

Second is that this DVD is easily the sickest of them all, with the aforementioned routine colliding with the 'Debbie Gibson lesbian-paedophilia' skit. Many people like his more vulgar routines but, as with the girlfriend/housemate scenario, it is not the type of thing you want to be seen watching. It is also notable that Hicks himself ditched such 'Nasty Comic' routines in his later shows.

Anyhow, if you want to see some of Bill's material from after (and even during) his alcohol phase, then this DVD is a real treat and the first 2/3's of the routine comes over slightly dated but still as sharp as ever.

However, if you've stumbled across this while exploring Bill's work, then do listen to his other albums and DVD's first.

Either way it is worth remembering that, although he was a genius with bountiful insights, he also had equally gifted contemporaries (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sam-Kinison/dp/B002UPQ23C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sam Kinison</a>), who are worth checking out too...",1314057600,,2668,6.2506811989100814

2446793,5,B000BYAD8O,"No matter how many times I see these routines, I laugh so hard I can't breathe.  It is Spiritualism from  a comic genius' perspective.

Comedy is more than being an ""amusement engineer"" as Hicks calls himself in the DVD.  He reveals our collective hypocrisy and acceptance of world situations.  Bill Hicks expresses viewpoints in an outrageous, humorous and sometimes offensive manner that really make you think.

He may be dead, but he is definitely not gone.",1212192000,5,460,4.9868421052631575
2446794,4,B000BYAD8O,If you are a Bill Hicks fan this is a nice piece of his history. The quality is poor (due to the recording itself and not the dvd) and there aren't any frills; still a nice performance.,1182816000,2,185,4.027027027027027
2446795,5,B000BYAD8O,"Please, just start out with this one, folks.  This performance is so developed that it encompasses much of the Hicks legend.  And it's from 1989.  He grew from here, but since he was dead by 1994 he simply didn't have a chance to keep going.  To make an analogy, this is Nirvana's 'Nevermind' and 'Revelations' (on the 'Social Critic' DVD) is 'In Utero.'  You need to own both--20 bucks and you get six hours of one of the greatest comedians ever.  Even if you hate what he says, spend 20 bucks to argue his ideas, but be honest.  Regardless of your beliefs, you will gain some new perspectives on your world.",1163635200,6,609,4.4324324324324325
2446796,5,B000BYAD8O,"O.K....let me start off by saying I'm not really that much into religion.  But, I honestly believe that BILL HICKS was an angel, sent down from heaven by GOD, to open our eyes to what is REALLY going on in the world.  Not only is Bill hilarious, he is also brutally HONEST. I consider Bill a preacher/comedian.  The very first time I heard Bill perform, I cried.  Not from laughing so hard, but by realizing the TRUTH.  Not to sound over-dramatic, but Bill changed my life.  I now look at political,religious,and other serious issues in our society in a completly different way.

Bill Hicks is nothing short of genius.  I own every one of his albums and dvds, and I never get tired of listening to him or watching him perform.  Its such a shame that he had to leave us so early.  And, we should be grateful, that GOD sent him to us.  I hope that whoever is reading this, will buy his cds or watch his dvds and experience what I did.  And, maybe he can have an impact on other lives as well.",1147305600,5,990,4.263440860215054
2446807,5,B000BYAD8O,"I purchsed this several years back on VHS and now it's finally on DVD. First of all, Hicks was brilliant and this performance lives up to that very discription. The show builds slowly will Bill seemingly feeling out the audience, by doing tried and true material, almost yeoman-like, but as the time passes the material starts getting more dark (or blue if you will) and Hicks starts going for the ""kill-shot"" with material that made me laugh so hard my sides hurt and tears ran down my face. His old, fat, washed-up Elvis (who didn't do drugs.....but was a heavy smoker instead) on Tour with Steppenwolf is timeless. Hicks toys with a few audience members ( - to the camerman- ""get a shot of that JC Penney shirt"") (and a drunk sounding woman in the crowd)and it all works perfectly. This is the best Hicks' set I've ever seen.",1143331200,2,828,4.563758389261745
2446808,5,B000BYAD8O,"What an insightful riot this guy was! Humanity does so desperately need more who will fearlessly come right out and say what so many are thinking yet are afraid to express. In this early routine from 1989, you'll find ample amounts of familiar Hicks views, ideas and gags - trying to get the same message across tends to make one repetitive - and he's much more lewd in his approach to rattle people compared to the more spiritual overtones of his subsequent material. But it's especially the latter half or so of this set that soars well above range as you realize the crowd had largely decided [although not all of them!] to strap on their existential crash helmets, let out a primal howl to the moon, and follow Hicks past the point of no return as they're ""lectured by a pale demon.""

Hicks repeatedly jabs the phobic pressure points of his audience with his scathing critque of the culturally fascist, ""anti-intellectual"" ethic that noticeably began permeating the country in the early 80s like a bad rash. It is nothing short of searing, damning, and high on fire. America had become a ""Reagan Wet Dream"" version of itself, indoctrinating most into a 24/7/365 shopping mall mindset within a perpetually soothing 72 degree environment: what more could humanity hope for?

""Sane Man"" has plenty of extras, additional clips and footage, and is highly recommended for old or new fans alike. Worth pointing out too is that with Bill Hicks, much like dissident/anarchist Noam Chomsky [who Bill would liken his views with], part of the public's fundamental attraction to such ""fringe"" types doesn't have as much to do with an interest in the usual cult of celebrity persona worship as much as it does the important, relevant social issues which are addressed by only a daring few while strategically ignored within the mainstream which seeks to control the public mind, to continually reinforce a limited view of reality that supports the social and economic power structure by disguising and downplaying the grim, daily realities within the staus quo. The personal psychological impetus driving such social outlaws is obvious, if not irrelevant, for every life embodies contradictory elements: Bill's passion was to raise awareness and wake people up. We miss ya man, and thanks to those who continually work to help keep Bill's voice alive, passing the torch further still.

""The record of anarchist ideas, and even more, of the inspiring struggles of people who have sought to liberate themselves from oppression and domination, must be treasured and preserved, not as a means of freezing thought and conception in some new mold but as a basis for understanding of the social reality and committed work to change it. There is no reason to suppose that history is at an end, that the current structures of authority and domination are graven in stone. It would also be a great error to underestimate the power of social forces that will fight to maintain power and privledge."" ~ Chomsky",1139356800,18,2987,4.934393638170974
2446809,3,B000BYAD8O,"I know Hicks died way too soon, especially given the current state of things (oh how we need him now), but for a guy who taped his shows and was such a workaholic, there is way too much in terms of repetition here, compared with the CDs and the DVD compilation Ryko put out in 2004, sort of like the visual equivalent of Shock and Awe with Salvation.  There isn't much different to justify buying it in addition to what one already has.

That's not saying it's not great, but it's just more of the same in terms of what you've heard before from a gone before his time comic genius.  When he starts to get into referencing popular culture, then pop tarts like Debbie Gibson and Tiffany are too far in the past to merit laughter as it's the fault of time that they are already punchlines.  Ditto for George ""What's the Sound of One Hand Clapping?"" Michael.

Completists, you'll want this.  Novices should look to the other Ryko release.  I wish I could give it a higher rating.

2446810,4,B000BYAD8O,"This is one of Bill Hicks best performances but sadly this dvd is incomplete. A very taboo joke is missing from it and I have no idea why. The performance itself is worth 5 stars, hell just about anything from Hicks is worth 5 stars. Recommended if you are a fan of his work  or you're looking for comedy that's still relevant today. A master comedian who left us before he should have, but what he has left us is pure gold. The dvd itself looks much better than the previous bootleg I was forced to watch and has stellar extra's. But the incomplete performance, when the footage is available, is really unforgivable for me. The reason I bought the dvd was to have an excellent copy of it, and it pretty much is but whomever decided to discard the joke should be held responsible. Buy the this disc anyways cause if you haven't seen what's missing it won't hurt. I miss ya Bill...",1138406400,6,880,4.365853658536586
2446811,2,B000BYAD8O,"I love Bill Hicks.  I own every available CD of the man's work.  Listening to Mr. Hicks' concerts motivated me to read two books about the man.  His intellect and material far outshine that of George Carlin and Lewis Black.  Oh, if only he had lived long enough -- he died in 1994 of pancreatic cancer -- to decapitate George W. Bush with his rapier-like wit! (He was no friend of George H. W. Bush, often referring to him as ""...a child of satan..."")

That said...

This DVD isn't very good.  It looks and sounds as though it had been dubbed from a ratty VHS bootleg.  The contained material is prime Hicks, but the same material is available on the much-better ""Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian,"" DVD.

""Bill Hicks Live - Satirist, Social Critic, Stand-Up Comedian,"" contains three concerts.  Those concerts (""One Night Stand,"" ""Relentless,"" and ""Revelations,"") are preserved here in pristine condition.  In addition to the concerts, a documentary on Hicks, ""Just a Ride,"" is also included.",1137196800,15,1020,4.872093023255814
2446812,5,B000BYAD8O,"Teriffic show, entertaining throughout, and gives us a peek as to what it was like for Hicks to deal with crowds on a weekend-to-weekend basis.  You feel them pull back, then see Hicks draw them back in, but just..so..much...until...

The editing is distracting, but you can say the same thing about ""Richard Pryor: Live and Smokin'"", and that didn't stop it from being one of the best stand-up videos of all time, either.

Hicks was great and I'll always be a fan.  But whoever said that there ""there are no comedians now who are even close"" to having the wit and balls of Hicks obviously hasn't heard of Doug Stanhope, Auggie Smith, Danny Bevins, or dozens of other comics who, like Hicks during his lifetime, aren't neccessarily getting the recognition they deserve.

2446813,5,B000BYAD8O,"In ""Sane Man"" Bill Hicks lets you know in his own unique, powerfully descriptive way.  In this DVD you will discover that yes, somebody hated Tiffany, Debbie Gibson and Wham! just as much or more than you did.  You will find out that you're not alone in your disdain for American Mall Culture, pussified rock stars who do coke commercials and John Davidson.

People love Bill Hicks because he said all the stuff we are thinking but don't have the balls or wit to say.  There are no comedians now who are even close.  Now the comedians revolve around redneck and race bits, Christ, it's so tired.  Today's comedy produces a huge Bill Hicks ""jaw-breaking"" yawn.

You know he was the man when people today talk about how much a guy like Bill needs to be around to comment on the catastrophy of George Bush.  Hicks was the man.  The Sane Man video really is one of the very best testaments to his greatness.  Who else could bring you images of butterflies flying out of Dick Clark's jasmine scented anus?",1136505600,4,1000,4.5055555555555555
2446814,5,B000BYAD8O,"Blown away. First of all, I'm a die-hard Goat-child of Hicks, but regardlwss of my love for the man, this is an AMAZING DVD! The show itself, often considered by his close friends (like Kevin Booth and Jimmy Pineapple) to be his best performance. It was the first time Kevin filmed Bill, and he did not let the cameras down! I had heard alot of this material but I never got to see him in all his comedic glory. I laughed outloud many times, even on bits I've heard a hundred times! The expanded show is so amazing, Bill rants and raves and challenges, and kills, and alot of seems to be off-the-cuff. You get to see the seeds of some of his most famous stuff here, being created right in front of his home crowd of Austin, Texas. Bill Hicks is such a physical presence, as well as an exceedingly intelligent and thought-provoking individual, and ""Sane Man"" captures his energy like nothing I've seen yet. Out of all my Hicks collection, this so far is my favorite. Its just so packed, with so much new content for us starving Hicks fans. Many infamous bits such as the Hendrix/Debbie Gibson/Rick Astley masterpiece are here, so don't miss out! There are many extras as well, a fantastic show from Bill's partying days with the Outlaws is included, as well as a hilarious Elvis bit, cape and all!

Even if you are not a huge Hicks fan, or especially if you have never experienced his comedic genius, you must see this! Its a great introduction to Hicks, right when his star started to rise, right after he cleaned himself up and went sober, and he transcends himself here, on film, for all comedy-lovers and seekers of enlightenment to enjoy!

2446815,5,B000BYAD8O,"""Bill Hicks Live"" (the first Hicks DVD) is a terrific disc,  but ""Sane Man"" was clearly designed with the hardcore Hicks fans in mind. I've seen the VHS version of ""Sane Man,"" and while it is the same performance that is on this DVD, material has definitely been put back in that was missing from the video version. As a result, what we have is the closest thing to a genuinely complete, unedited Hicks performance that is commercially available - if there still is anything that has been edited out, it's very difficult to tell as the flow is completely uninterrupted (unlike the performances on ""Bill Hicks Live,"" which contain obvious cuts). This is also Hicks at his most raw - he's in top form in this show - angry about the the state of things in America (and his observations have only grown in relevance with time), sexually perverse and yet full of compassion for all of humanity all at the same time in that unique Hicks fashion. Plus he's in his natural environment - a comedy club on his home turf of Austin, Texas, as opposed to the performances on ""Bill Hicks Live"" which were filmed at concert halls in Canada and the UK. As a result, I imagine that this film is the closest thing to what it was like to experience Hicks live. I also really like the graininess of the video material at the beginning and end of the show, which gives it an underground vibe that is lacking from his later, more slick-looking productions. You can tell that the show was produced by his friend Kevin Booth, as Booth, being intimately familiar with Hicks' style, knows how to use the camera to enhance the power of the performance. The extras on the disc are essential viewing for any Hicks fan, as we finally get to see video from his legendary Outlaw Comics days of the 1980s, including a complete, unedited set. If you're a Hicks fan, you already know you have to have this. If you're not, you either don't like comedy or you haven't seen it yet - there's no other possibility.",1133913600,6,1974,4.4986072423398324

This is an incontrovertible fact. Until you see this performance, you have not seen the best comedy ever made. Its even better than the other DVD's of Hicks because it is less commercial, and therefore more effective in conveying his raw on-stage power and immediacy. Perhaps you think I'm exaggerating,just wait till you see Sane Man and, notwith- standing the some times out-of-date material, realize he was the king of realcomedy.
