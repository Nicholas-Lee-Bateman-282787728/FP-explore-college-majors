188100,5,1570763399,"This book approaches the topic from a very personal, fundamental, baseline and requires that the reader step back from the modern, mechanical, approach to understanding these wonderful creatures. All great horsemen reach a spiritual understanding of horses and through that discovery achieve the deepest levels of communication. Here, as in many aspects of life, less is definitely more.",1333152000,4,387,5.689655172413793
188101,3,1570763399,"As an equestrian who seeks to continue to broaden my knowledge of the relationship between horse and human I found the content to be lovely to watch but not enough information was provided. I was anticipating more examples of how Mr Hempfling goes about his training.  I do believe Mr Hempfling has something to offer the equine community, but it seems he is keeping a lot of the ""how to's"" to himself. Maybe there is more information in his follow up books and videos, but after viewing the Dancing with Horses video I am cautious about spending more money to find out.",1303430400,10,570,4.588235294117647
188102,1,1570763399,"I purchased this item based on the feedback -- feedback from others is a useful tool.  I was looking for a HOW TO program, but instead received a 60 minute infomercial on Hempfling's work with horses.  This should have been free.  So, if you are looking for a HOW TO, this is not for you.  If you want to pay $30 plus for a promo on horse instruction, this is as good as any others.",1244592000,16,382,4.053333333333334
188103,1,1570763399,What a waste of money!  The dvd doesn't really teach you anything at all.  It's not really a system that you can put in place... it's not an instructional video.  I kept waiting and waiting to get to the part where I would learn the steps 1-2-3 to employ to read the horse's body language.  It never came.  Maybe the book is different...,1232064000,9,337,4.285714285714286
188104,3,1570763399,"I enjoyed this video very much. It gives some interesting perspectives on handling horses. I loved the footage of Mr. Ferdinand riding his horses without saddle or bridle. A good starting point if you are interested in this man's written materials, which you really would need to read to get the most out of his teachings. It has some philosophical ideas that I don't particularly subscribe to but I would Definitely recommend the DVD.",1213747200,2,435,4.891891891891892
7797188,5,1570763399,"I find this DVD absolutely beautiful - but as mentioned in many of the other reviews ist is not particularly instructional - I think it is not meant to be! Hempfling is an artist with horses and expresses emotions much more than step-by-step instructions, because his whole approach to horses is based on emotions and the voluntary cooperation of the horses. However, in his excellent books on horse training he actually tells it all - in his philosophic way. Also his novel Message from the Horse is interesting and explains how he came to his way of being with horses. Hempfling is an excellent horseman and in recent years he has done a lot to provide insights into his approach! This DVD was one of the first works from him and even though it is nearly ancient, it still is beautiful. Reading the books and watching the DVD's will altogether give anyone interested a good basis venturing into the world of the horses.",1471996800,,921,4.656441717791411
7797189,2,1570763399,"not very helpful, more like a promo video with no particular details",1465344000,,68,4.75
7797190,5,1570763399,"I really like this book, however, it is not as ""how to"" as a person might want.  It really helps to already be familiar with the methods of Tom Dorrance or Ray Hunt then this will make more sense.  However, I give five starts for what it is.  It does require some thought and study, and shedding some old practices.",1448064000,,315,4.216666666666667

7797193,3,1570763399,"I was searching for more answers and instruction, and was hoping this was more of a visual tool following the book, a little disappointed but still got some pointers and always beautiful to watch this mans work.",1404777600,,211,4.72972972972973
7797194,4,1570763399,"It is an excellent tool but you need to have the book also because it does not describe the steps one by one. But you see the training in action and can study the excact posture of the body and actually see some of the reactions by horses and humans, which I think is, if not essential, the least exctremely helpful, in order to do what is described in the book ""Dancing with horses"".",1395878400,,384,4.202702702702703
7797195,2,1570763399,"I suppose Hempfling has some good training techniques (I've read through his book of the same name and didn't think it was terrible), but this video describes very few of them. It's just not useful as a training aid. If you know some horse-minded people who are ignorant of body language training philosophies, this isn't a bad introduction. Apart from that, there are sadly limited applications for this item. Some people have described this program as a big commercial or even an infomercial, and this isn't far from the truth. There are some lovely shots of Hempfling among horses at liberty, but the descriptions of what his training is ""about"" are very vague. Frankly, he seems rather arrogant in person. People criticized the PBS documentaries about Monty Roberts back in the day, but those actually had some explanations and summaries of the basis of Roberts' fundamentals. This one spends more time bragging about Hempfling's ideas than showing them in action.

This one isn't completely unbearable to sit through as casual entertainment, but you won't glean useable training information from it. If you absolutely *must* buy it, at least go for the VHS tape version to save money.",1378166400,3,1189,5.035532994923858
7797196,2,1570763399,"I expected to learn how Mr. Hempfling did to reach such respect from horses, specially from stallions. The DVD contains some beautiful images but very few instructions on how to do. That's what really frustrated me.",1375660800,3,215,5.0
7797197,5,1570763399,Klaus gets the point across about the handler/trainer/rider needing to be grounded and balanced mentally and spiritually That is how humans can best relate to horses to gain their trust.,1355702400,,186,5.233333333333333
