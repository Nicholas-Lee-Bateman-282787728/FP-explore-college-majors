The incomparable Michel Simon plays M. le Sentencier, a retired judge so hardline he was nicknamed 'M. le Maximum', now living an emasculated high-bourgeois life with a domineering wife.  They decide to take a holiday, the chauffeur reluctantly leaving behind a girlfriend whose attractiveness to others drives him into jealous rages.  Anxious on this score, he neglects the car, which breaks down.  While he is sent off for a mechanic, M. and Mme. le Sentencier take refuge in a seedy inn, whose criminal occupants (including a delightfully brassy Arletty) immediately spot rich pickings.  They decide to make their guests very welcome.
Like Melville's vivid gangster caper of two decades later, 'Bob le Flambeur', much of this film's flavour lies in the witty slang of its dialogue, imperfectly transcribed in the subtitles, and sometimes difficult even for French speakers to follow.  This doesn't seriously detract from the film's pleasure, which mainly arises from the comic gusto with which these peerless actors attack their roles, mixing vaudevillean vigour with a knowing sophistication.  Even his admirers under-rate Boyer's visual abilities, but the unobtrusive intelligence of his camera movements, composition and editing contribute to the film's excellence and meaning.
At a time when French cinema was agonising over what it meant to be French and the imminence of national catastrophe, Boyer takes a more sardonic look at the subject.  In the film's most famous sequence, the cast-relay performance of the song 'Comme de bien entendu', all the cliches of the 'French' 'character' are invoked - bistros, champagne, accordions, dancing, peasant bonhomie etc.  but this is a carefully constructed illusion to con a pair of rich strangers, just as the French tourist industry hoodwinks foreigners.  The scene is ambiguous, however - although they are being conned, the le Sentenciers also benefit from their stay, their stolid bourgeois existence spiritually rejuvenated.  They are on holiday, and there is a carnivalesque quality to proceedings, an overturning of everyday rules or roles, to the point where a judge leads the robbery of his own house.  Criminal transgression is linked to the sexual, as the husband and wife find their near-extinguished amorous fires relit by young strangers.
The film has also a canny sense of class: the narrative's hierarchy - from the bourgeois le Senteniers to their class-conscious servants to the tradesmen who serve them to the underclass who exploit them - is brilliantly expressed in Boyer's use of physical space.  The audience is on the side of the social disruptors - when the chauffeur causes the accident that disrupts the Le Sentencier's ordered existence, his anxieties about his girlfriend are projected on the windscreen as on a cinema screen, mirroring the very spectators watching him.",1019520000,,3135,5.347560975609756
