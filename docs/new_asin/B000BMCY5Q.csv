My regular clients tell me they're having less headaches! This is so useful in the massage industry because so many of the people I work with have allergies and get headaches often.

This DVD includes professional massage techniques, lymph drainage benefits, and all the little details that I need to really make the information stick.

Give it a try! :D",1415318400,2,500,4.8023255813953485

This is great for anyone who is just starting out in this therapy or as a refresher for someone that is already qualified or even for someone that is interested  in the subject. The demonstration is set at a good pace so you could take notes while you're watching it. I would recommend this product to anyone.",1415232000,2,478,4.690476190476191
