8016139,1,B0001Q47L6,I got this disc of lies as a gag birthday gift last year. During the party we watched it and we had some good laughs.  If you take this serious you are a naive tool.  Marijuana is a gift from mother nature so enjoy it!,1380067200,,218,3.8222222222222224

8016141,1,B0001Q47L6,"When used in moderation there are many spiritual, medicinal and recreational benefits from the use of marijuana. It is a harmless plant that has been misunderstood by those who are heavily influenced by others and those in fear of the unknown. Marijuana saves and helps lives everyday and is less addicting than caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes and many other overlooked legal subtances . The people in this movie put the blaim for their problems on the plant rather than on themselves for abusing marijuana. Whether it's eating too much or smoking too much, anything used excessively could have a negative effect on someone's life. Obesity, alcoholism, etc. have ruined far far far more lives than this plant ever has or ever will.",1151884800,2,729,5.033057851239669

8016143,1,B0001Q47L6,yeah the emperor wears no cloths is not pro pot or anti pot. This movie was made by a group of people who are afraid of a plant. i know this for a fact. Also marijuana is not a gateway drug. It can be used by people who are going to use harder drugs already because of there emotional state and MOVE past weed because it is not strong enough for them.,1101600000,5,351,3.888888888888889
8016144,1,B0001Q47L6,"I haven't seen this DVD because I can't afford it.  But I can say that there is a huge amount of free material from the center for disease control, including a video on the myths about marijuana, and all sorts of drug education videos, for FREE.  I would never spend this amount of money when comparable products are available at no cost.",1099958400,3,338,4.435483870967742
