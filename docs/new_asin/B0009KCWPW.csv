Although I did get my money back, I had to go through the hassle of returning it and they still didn't correct the order. I would have to go back to the start and re-order hoping they can read.  Terrible experience!!!!!",1307232000,,288,4.236363636363636
8496898,4,B0009KCWPW,The kids were skeptical at first but the movie pulled them in and they enjoyed it. Every now and then they would be yelling out answers or something.,1188864000,,149,4.357142857142857

8496900,5,B0009KCWPW,"We both enjoyed the DVD a great deal.  The songs stuck in our heads and we both found ourselves humming them throughout the day.  This DVD would be a great asset to parents with portable DVD players.  It will serve as a FUN reminder for children who may get bored on the trip for things that can be done to help pass the ""Miles"".  We loved the little quizzes and had fun

competing for the answers.  I would recommend this DVD to parents with little adventure seekers.",1117670400,10,468,4.32183908045977
8496901,5,B0009KCWPW,"I found this DVD not only educational, without my children knowing it but interesting, as well. If you asked their opinion they say it was FUNNY! My youngest two children are still asking to watch it again and again and are now quoting from ARE WE THERE YET? Well done! This is a keeper for our movie gallery for my children to choose from.
