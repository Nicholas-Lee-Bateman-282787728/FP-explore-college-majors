5708964,5,B00CA4S416,"This is definitely my favorite show. Each season is even better than the last. For more Ricky Gervais, check out his podcasts and ""The Ricky Gervais Guide To..."" audiobooks.",1381536000,,173,5.0
5708965,5,B00CA4S416,"Love, Love, Love Ricky Gervais! great product. All Three characters Are Lovable In Their Own Way. Hope They Never Quit Creating These Podcasts",1378080000,,142,5.217391304347826
5708966,5,B00CA4S416,"I love this show...I've got seasons 1-3 and watch them over and over.  I do think it's an acquired taste though since my friends don't seem to share my enthusiasm...but, hey, they don't have to watch then...it's still funny!",1377820800,,224,4.743589743589744
5708967,5,B00CA4S416,"Just as good as the previous two. Don't think twice, get it. Ricky and Stephen are great and Karl is as bizarre and entertaining as ever.",1377734400,,137,4.3076923076923075
5708968,5,B00CA4S416,"I cannot get enough of this dvd. In fact I own all three seasons. Thank you HBO. I watch an episode every night, and it puts me in the best mood! The three of them work so well together. Karl is amazing, not to mention how quick witted Stephen and Ricky are. I recommend this to any Ricky fan. You'll appreciate every moment. The animation is fantastic, I roll on the floor laughing at some scenes. A MUST for any library!",1376265600,,422,4.222222222222222
5708969,5,B00CA4S416,"When I first saw this show a couple of years ago I thought Ricky & Stephen were just being mean to Karl.  Then as I watched more I became hooked.  The animation works brilliantly as they illustrate scenes and ideas that are being discussed.  I believe that Karl is genuine - no one could make him up, he's too perfect - but I think also it's easy to overlook that he's not an idiot, he's not stupid, he just has some odd views of things.  He also makes some very funny comments that are just brilliant, but his sense of humor seems to dry that he never laughs.

All three seasons of this show are brilliant.  It's so funny and there are times I've cried I've laughed so hard.  But it's not for everyone.  If the idea of listening to three guys talk for half an hour doesn't appeal to you, then it might not be for you.",1375833600,,818,4.132911392405063
5708970,5,B00CA4S416,made for the US and funny. a lot of material is from the GUIDE TO podcasts. very funny and worth it,1375401600,,99,3.761904761904762
5708971,4,B00CA4S416,These are again very funny episodes.  Karl has a new movie idea and wild opinions about anything and everything.  There are no special features.  This was disappointing given the first two seasons did have bonus material.,1372809600,,221,5.083333333333333
5708972,5,B00CA4S416,I absolutely love this show!  Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant talk to Karl Pilkington about everyday situations and how Karl handles/deals with life.  Sometimes Karl's ideas do seem like an idiotic at first but after thinking about it for awhile he is actually quite brilliant.  It is annoying that at this time we can only buy the digital version by the episode instead of the entire season like we can with the first and second seasons.  Hopefully Amazon will fix this soon.,1369699200,,479,4.804878048780488
5708973,5,B00CA4S416,"This is a great season of The Ricky Gervais Show. Its more of the same shenanigans from Ricky, Steve and Karl set to hilarious animation. HOWEVER i was quite upset when i put in the second disc to watch the last few episodes and they weren't there. Instead its just the special features. I was quite angry and feel ripped off, hopefully Warner Archives fixes this.",1368489600,3,364,4.53030303030303

8579076,5,B00CA4S416,I love this show so much.  I will be in tears and unable to breathe from laughing so hard at least once an episode.  I constantly have to rewind because I miss the next jokes from laughing for so long.,1409961600,,201,4.0
8579077,5,B00CA4S416,"Please put out a regular dvd version of this season!  Not a DVD-R set!  Yes, when you buy this season, you are getting a DVD-R copy.  Come on HBO or Time Warner...whoever!",1403395200,2,171,4.28125
8579078,3,B00CA4S416,One of my favourite shows of all time; I recommend it to anyone who has a good sense of humour and enjoys animation. I unfortunately couldn't watch 3 of the episodes on this DVD as it was damaged when it arrived. :/,1398038400,,215,4.142857142857143
