5897822,5,B00E96AZBK,"A great David Fincher film. It has all his technical craft and brilliant stylized shots. It has the deep tension and atmosphere of his other films but with a little less ick-factor (as can be done in a film about a serial killer).
This one's a Tone poem and not a blunt instrument. You ease into it like a warm bath, and soak up the vibes and frequencies it gives off...slipping into the trance-like state the atmosphere puts you in and hope you wake before drowning in it. It's that kind of movie. And you feel kinda weird after, because there is no closure to the mystery (that's not a spoiler there!).
Beautiful looking Steelbook. Very good Transfer.",1409356800,2,653,4.5423728813559325
5897823,5,B00E96AZBK,Great movie and i got it a great price.  The special features are also cool.  This was well worth the price.,1403481600,,108,4.095238095238095
5897824,2,B00E96AZBK,"This is a cash grab.  The cover is made to look like the original theatrical poster.  However, it is the exact same blu ray release as the original 2007 release with the SF Chronicle letter cover.  In my opinion, that cover is better anyways!  Steer clear unless you don't already own this.  If you don't own it, it is a GREAT FILM and you should pick it up.  You will probably be able to find a copy of the SF Chronicle version cheaper anyways though.  I hope this helps!",1392854400,25,472,4.235955056179775
5897825,5,B00E96AZBK,Is this a re-issue?  There was confusion about the Cowboys & Aliens re-release announcement--Universal made it sound like there was a new extended extended edition and there isn't--just a re-issue.  How is this release different than the awesome Zodiac 2 disc set that was released with the white envelope cover on it?  My guess is that it's no different--just released again and more affordable.  Great movie if you haven't seen it yet.  Easily one of the best films of the last decade.,1391644800,3,487,4.890243902439025

5897827,4,B00E96AZBK,"In terms of video, audio and extras is the same as the one realesed by Paramount Pictures on 2009, but the case is now from STEELBOOK.
Probably the movie itself it's not so interesting for all audiences, probably just for thoses how just like the movies directed by David Fincher or the ones how like films about mystery, because this is a mystery film.
It stars with Iron Man & Hulk, I mean Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo & of course with Jake Gyllenhall.
The Movie [7.7] is well directed, well acted and is based on real live events.
In terms of VIDEO [5.0], is really one of the best, but in audio [3.0] not so much, in the audio you only count with Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (old audio transfer) and there is no adicional audios, no commentary, no latin american spanish as the DVD version of the film.
In EXTRAS [4.5]  this is more like it, that's why there is a second disc for all featurettes including Zodiac Deciphered, The Visual Effects of Zodiac, Previsualizations, just to say a few.
CONCLUSION : This is a must for Fincher's Fans and those who liked this movie, if not just rent it.
Add to your collection if you are looking for good movies and steelbooks.",1430092800,,1161,4.425233644859813

5897829,4,B00E96AZBK,Entertaining moving. Interesting how the main suspect in the moving was in the same places as the murders as they occurred. When the suspect was sent away the Zodiac went silent. When the suspect was released from his prison/mental hospital sentence for an unrelated charge he sends a letter to the detective and when the suspect passed away nothing further has ever been received regarding the Zodiac. Where there is smoke there is normally fire and the suspect made to many statements that pointed to him and was in all the locations when the murders occurred.,1426809600,,562,4.864583333333333

5897832,5,B00E96AZBK,"Zodiac

This film is based on actual facts. A young couple park where it quiet. Some shots ring out, but they remain parked. A car parks near by, and more shots are fired. Someone calls the police to report it. A letter from the killer arrives at the 'San Francisco Chronicle'. [Those other newspapers are extinct.] The cartoonist studies the cipher. The Zodiac killer strikes in daylight. [Never let yourself be tied up.] Then a cabdriver is shot in San Francisco. Another letter arrives at the newspaper with an insane threat. [The film reminds us of the old technology in use then.] Books tell about ciphers and codes. Why would anyone trust a stranger on a dark road? Reporter Paul Avery uncovers an old murder in Riverside California. Then a tip names a suspect. The police look at him, but have a problem. The Zodiac killer strikes again.

Robert Graysmith researches the libraries to learn who borrowed books on codes. He is allowed the privilege of reviewing police files, and finds a clue. An anonymous phone call brings a new clue. After years have passed a new Zodiac letter appears. Why does Robert need to do this? He follows another clue about a poster. Robert is obsessed about this case. He finds some facts that point to a cleared suspect - only ""circumstantial evidence"". Then a long sought witness is found and identifies a photo. But the passage of time prevents any further action.

The film recreates the Bay Area of California in the early 1970s. It seems slightly over-long, but seems to cover this unsolved case dramatically. They had four different actors portray the Zodiac killer, as if they hedged their bet about a single killer. Note the different MOs, and the false claims for murders that were untrue. Copycat killings are possible.",1415664000,,1765,4.7993421052631575

5897835,5,B00E96AZBK,One of the scariest movies for me. Marvelous performances all around including one really creepy performance from Charles Fleisher.

8602853,4,B00E96AZBK,"A gruesome recreation of one of the 20th Century's worst US serial killing sprees.  The film is as meticulous in its attention to period details over its 25-year-span in its construction of the case facts and characterization.  Director Gilroy's take focuses not so much on the victims, or even the Zodiac himself, as on the lives of those caught between the two and seeking to expose him.  This is the easiest way to deal with such troubling material but Gilroy makes it work in this movie.

One criticism is that although fast-paced, it seems inconclusive.  The ""real truth"" of Zodiac remains open, and the story thus dribbles at its end like the last blobs from a ketchup bottle.  Yet this is how situations play out in real time: not bound by formal narrative construction or studio budgets.  Gyllenhaal's Robert Graysmith seems so closely identified with the Zodiac that at the beginning of the film we're almost led to believe this is the killer.  Graysmith's obsession is the movie's driving force, but we're not really brought to understand why this should be.  Is it because he's a low-level newspaper flunkey who wants to run with the big dogs of the newsroom?  Does he identify with the Zodiac?  The only answer of why he should care is given to his estranged wife: ""Because no one else will."" In the end the film ends up - like Graysmith's book - becoming more about Graysmith.  (Jim Garrison-JFK.)

Overall a good crime drama and a look at a time when ennui was all the rage.",1478044800,,1488,4.676923076923077

8602857,5,B00E96AZBK,"This is really an underrated movie.  Great actors and protagonists that find ways to solve and crack down crime.  Really good investigation film that gets you closer and closer to finding the truth on whodunit.  If you can bear with the gruesome scenes of disturbing scenarios that might freak some people out, then I suggest you watch it only if you are at least above the ages of 18.  Overall, I loved the excellent form of communication between different parties to convict the criminal and I couldn't believe when the culprit just kept managing to elude the pursuers even though they were right in between their fingertips.  I thought it was cool when the movie indicated that only those who are genuinely curious, those who want to stick with the evidence and their gut feeling, can attempt to leave a case fully completed.  The keen eyed detectives are the ones who figure out what's going on when others are basically uninterested and forgetful of what happened when there is so much change in day to day activities from each person to the next and all of this can basically distract us from perceiving the right messages to decode right understanding.  ""Just because you can't prove something doesn't mean it's not true.""  No second guesses here.  We all know whodunit, right?",1443484800,,1284,4.8
