7890100,5,6305479895,"Lolita holds the dubious honor of the orca who born free, has survived the longest in captivity. Known to her friends as Tokitae, or Toki,(beautiful day) she resides at the Miami Seaquarium, in the smallest, most shallow, orca tank in the United states. For almost 40 years Toki's tail drags the bottom of the tank when she spyhops to get a good look at her surroundings.

Toki gets the food she needs to survive during performances, which take place 3 times a day, 7 days a week.

Her pod in Puget Sound would recognize her by her calls, and as resident orcas do, would care for her until she could care for herself. Or she could reside in a baypen until she shows a desire to rejoin the Southern Residents as the 3 pods of Puget Sound are called.

""Spirit In The Water"" was produced when  the campaign to return Toki to her family was becoming intense. For more information, just put a search in for ""Lolita,"" and this should bring up the Orca Network.

""Free Willy 3"" shows some wonderful footage of Friday Harbor, WA. which was once Lolita's home... and hopefully, might be again, one day.",1169424000,2,1093,4.5
