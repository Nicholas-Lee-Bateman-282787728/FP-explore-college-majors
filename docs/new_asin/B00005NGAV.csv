1633687,5,B00005NGAV,anyone who has a perverted sense of humor will love this gem! the actors are incredibly talented. i looove the way the nurse just so matter of factly goes about killing everyone. definitely 1 of my top 10 movies of all time!!!,996537600,3,226,4.404761904761905
1633688,5,B00005NGAV,"I haven't yet seen the DVD for this film but I saw it twice both before and after it was released for limited engagement.
The first time was a free test screening and nearly half the audience left before it was over. It wasn't until it was over and discussing it later that I realized what a grand movie it really is. The production values are garbage, so I certainly don't expect much from the DVD transfer. Although the thought of a 2pk are is making me wonder.
If you ever see it, just remember to watch it through to the end the last line, makes the 86 minutes you've wasted up to that point worthwhile.",995846400,2,607,4.241379310344827
1633689,5,B00005NGAV,"Unless you're a hardened cynic with a dark sense of humour who hates the media and loves cultural subversion, you won't get this movie. Which is a shame, because the message of Series 7: The Contenders really ought to be targeted at ordinary people. Suburbanites. Pap-watchers. Zombies. You know the type.
The best thing about Series 7 is that it doesn't pull any punches. It doesn't pander to the audience. In fact, it points the finger at them. This is happening, it says, and you're enjoying it. You know this is manipulation, yet you're allowing yourself to be manipulated. You think this is horrible, but you're watching it. This is your fault, audience, all your fault. By never moving outside the codes of television that it knows we all watch, Series 7 smacks the audience in the face with accusation after horrible accusation, and we know full well that we are guilty as charged.
Series 7 also does a powerful job of highlighting just how sneaky television is. Television can create conflict and horror, but always manages to escape the blame. It never allows us - not even for a moment - to consider the possibility that television might be in the wrong. Television makes its heroes out of the very people it shoots down. Disturbing. Unsettling.
Of course, Series 7 is also a perfect parody, scripted brilliantly and performed by an immensely talented cast. This is satire at its grisly best. Series 7 is a seriously funny movie.
Horribly plausible and thought-provoking, Series 7 is best watched in a group, because you'll all want somebody to talk about it with afterwards. Well done to all people concerned. Easily the best movie I've enjoyed in a long time.
(Incidentally, I have a sneaking suspicion that the Australian version - which I saw - might be a tiny bit different from the American version, so keep that in mind. I'm not sure though.)",991785600,11,1859,4.77639751552795
1633690,3,B00005NGAV,"series 7 the movie is a hilarious send off of most reality telivision shows , even though the film had a r rated code, my 13 year old daughter wanted to see this movie, first we have different charaters that unevenly come together , each are out to finish the other off, i mean really finish the others off, each one must hunt the other down to win.....killed or be killed, my little daugter laghed because even though the film takes it self serious you have to laugh at all the isanity these people are going through trying to hunt each other down, the best chareter i liked was this teenage girl that wants to kill a 70 year old man they do battle in a mall while the parents look on in horror as each trys to kill each other ...then there is a pregnant woman who is hunting down a old frend who is unsure if she can do the job...this is an offbeat type quirky movie its the kind of movie you will love or hate...think deathrace 2000 the old 70s film and survivor meeting each other .. well thats it, u decide who will live or bye this tape.",988329600,2,1043,4.142857142857143
1633711,5,B00005NGAV,"I thought this movie was genius. For those who didn't like it because it looked like it was shot on camcorder (which if I remember correctly, I think it was or it was shot on another kind of camera that wasn't supposed to be of good quality) or because the story sucked or whatever, there's something else there. It's not believable or unrealistic by accident. The movie is supposed to be a joke about all those lame reality TV shows that there are now days. It totally works because, in my opionion, I'd love to see seven morons on TV shooting each other to stay alive, it'd be a lot more interesting than the crap the media gives you to watch, anyhow. If that were the case, I might actually watch TV, but it's not. To sum it all up nice and easily, it was a great movie.",1085961600,,773,4.22972972972973
1633712,5,B00005NGAV,"""The Running Man"" isn't far behind
This is the kind of movie you wish you could sneak into the primetime lineup on a major network and laugh yourself silly at the utter chaos it would cause.
 I won't waste your time by describing the content of Series 7 The Contenders; there are plenty of reviews here for you to pick up what the story is all about.  Instead I'll try and explain what the film is all about in its meaning and message.
This movie was made right before the reality TV stupidity took over the airwaves.  How brilliantly insightful of Daniel Minahan to stab at the heart of the genre before it was even born; think of this movie as the failed abortion of Survi...  Anyway, many people don't seem to get what the film is doing in that they expect a nice neat packaged theatrical drama.  That is most certainly not what you will get from Series 7.  This movie makes fun of the audience for being so dumb as to sit through it.  Seriously, the movie bogs down intentionally in the middle, and bad.  This is the same tried and true tactic used on current network fodder; see how long you can possibly draw out the moment (the cheesy music is maddening) and prolong decision-making and action.  The audience (YOU) hates the stagnation but yet don't turn away because you're afraid you might miss something ""important.""  Well guess what?  The joke is on you; the point gets rubbed in with salt when you count number of ""commercial breaks"" you sat through before something exciting happens.
Now for the scary part:  Some people I've shown this movie to thought it was REAL!  It's done that convincingly.  If you want a good laugh show this movie to someone gullible; a reality TV fan is of course, perfect.  Tell them you looked on the Internet and your city is next in the lottery; if you can keep a straight face it turns into an epic joke.
Well as per my title I think this film fits right in the middle between current television programming and the Post Apocalyptic game shows like The Running Man and Smash TV.  Could this happen for real?  To tell the truth, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.  A few years ago I certainly wouldn't of believed you if you told me the whole world would actually tune in to watch a bunch of nobodies doing lame stunts and eating worms.  Masked strangers putting guns in your hand really don't seem that far fetched in comparison.",1077148800,2,2372,4.487179487179487
1633713,5,B00005NGAV,"This film is a reality show called ""Series 7:The Contenders"". However, this is no ordiary reality show. Six contenders are selected by lottery, assigned cameramen, armed with guns, and are forced to do battle against each other. Yep, you guessed it. The one left alive wins.
Series 7 is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It is amazing the way Daniel Minahan was able to capture the authenticity of the reality show. Series 7 is by far the most exciting and funny reality show that I have ever seen. While the object of the game is somewhat disturbing, all of the actors manage to play with intelligence and use methods that are very funny. Perhaps the film's best feature is that Minahan manages to create lifestyles for the characters. We get to see what they have to leave behind. It is impossible to pick a favorite out of the Contenders, because they all do an outstanding job. Even though they are all different, they all manage to do things that will shock you, and make you laugh. Their true natures come out! The rest of the film's actors also do an outstanding job, and really help add to the tension and suspense of the other players. Also, the film's ending is one of the funniest and most shocking endings that I have ever seen!
Series 7 is what reality TV is supposed to be all about. It is shocking, disturbing, and down right hillarious. All of the actors do an outstanding job, and really help to make the film believeable. It is also very suspenseful and you will be glued to the screen for the entire film!!! The DVD is a nice pickup. There are deleted scenes, a featurette, and much more. This is definately a must own! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1062720000,2,1680,4.493464052287582
1633714,4,B00005NGAV,"Series 7 was conceived before the success of Survivor and Fear Factor, but it hits the nail on the proverbial head as it skewers ratings-hungry, glitzy media and its complicit audience.  It also bears the marks of a worthwhile project that incubated for several years, as the cast inhabits these characters and the cast & crew comments are consistently thoughtful and thought-provoking.
Shot on video, at first the production style is distracting, but director-writer Daniel Minahan used to make television promos, and he brings his (and others) considerable expertise effectively to bear, so that you're quickly able to accept the grim premise of this movie -- that audiences will watch the most brutal spectacle if it is packaged well.  No one gets off lightly here -- not the producers, the participants or the viewers, and the cast, led by Brooke Smith (Vonya on 42nd Street, Silence of the Lambs) is superb.  Smith, looking and sounding like a Blood Simple-era Frances McDormand, plays the reigning Contender, pregnant and unflinchingly poised to kill.  Jeff the sick guy with a possible link to Dawn, Connie the nurse, Franklin your friendly neighborhood paranoic, and Tony -- who receives a ""self-inflicted knife wound to the back"", are Dawn's competition as raw Cops-style footage is framed by flashy, evocative promos.
This seems what The Truman Show would have been like if written by Rod Serling, and it would be a terrific midnight movie, with its absurdity, black humor, flash and great music.  There are three powerful scenes by mothers here (including Rudy Giuliani's ex, Donna Hanover) and the editing is wonderful.  I watched this film and thought it was okay, then watched it again a couple of hours later, and then again the next morning.  There were many layers of reality presented, so that you often wonder if what you are seeing is real, so the film lends itself to repeated viewings.
The film can be augmented by English close-captioning, and the DVD extras are terrific.  Commentary by writer-director Minahan is quite interesting, and the filmographies were edgey 10-minute interviews that really dig into the film.  You can view a couple of dozen stills, trailers and a great featurette about the Sundance Directors Lab, in which Minahan participated and was able to shoot several scenes in the production's early days.  This footage features Smith with other actors and other scenarios, and reveals enticing info about Sundance and the creative process.  Nine deleted scenes are worth watching, particularly an alternate ending that is even more chilling and explicit.
Caveat:  This is not a film for kids.  There are graphic murders and bleeding wounds, and there is the jarring acceptance by witnesses as contestants play out the game in public.  Disturbing and thought-provoking for an adult, inappropriate for a child.",1055721600,,2850,5.140692640692641
1633715,1,B00005NGAV,"This movie is listed as a comedy where I rent videos. It has a few funny moments, but doesn't really get me laughing. The satire, to me, is aimed more at reality show formats and production qualities than the genre itself. Just like the tripe that some networks call reality television, the dork in the helicopters does badly timed voiceovers and the cameras all have obnoxiously loud zoom motors.
The movie could have done better with the format: explaining some background of the show would have helped. Why are these people here? Did they sign up? Is it just an exercise in population control by the government? What motivation do they have to participate?
The directors try to make for a raw format, but the production quality is a little too developed for that premise to be believable. The synthesized commercial breaks are irregularly used, and could have been much funnier.
The show-based theme is not consistently applied throughout the movie. Jeff's unconciousness is a gaping plot hole, and Dawn's dye job grow-out is a surprisingly distracting continuity problem.
I'd agree with some of the reviews about an over-the-top satire of the reality TV genera being a great idea for the plot of a movie, but the execution is completely faulty.",1041033600,2,1248,4.919431279620853
1633716,5,B00005NGAV,"Just a straight-up hilarious movie, satirizing the whole ""Survivor-Real World"" mentality that seems to have gripped the American public.  This movie was conceived years ago, foretelling what would happen with American TV; unfortunately it was not released until just recently.
This movie is violent, make no mistake about it.  But it essentially just extrapolates on the whole ""reality TV"" genre that people just seem to love.
Of curious note:  On the DVD, check out the Special Features section, under the ""Sundance Directors Lab"" selection.  There is a ""re-enactment"" which features the actor who plays Artie Bucco from the ""Sopranos"".  Also, the main actress from ""Series 7"" had the role in ""Silence of the Lambs"" of Catherine Martin (""It puts the lotion on!"", you know, the woman in the well).
Watch this movie, it's certainly worth your time.  And please, stop watching ""The Bachelor/Fear Factor/Survivor/Real World"", you're just making yourself dumber by the minute.",1037404800,3,972,5.3202614379084965
1633717,4,B00005NGAV,"'Series 7' is a criminally underwatched satire that takes sweeps at reality TV, the kind of person that watches it as well as lampooning how such shows represent their characters.  The movie basically presents a marathon run of series 7 of a game show where people are picked by lottery and have to kill each other off; the winner gets to keep their life.  Dawn (Brooke Smith - the kidnapped girl from Silence of the Lambs), as the previous winner of two series now only has one more series to win in order to save her life and that of her unborn baby.
It's wonderfully sensationalist and every single aspect of reality TV is present and correct.  There's string arrangements over reunions, hectic camera movement and cheesy narration.  The acting is very naturalistic, drawing comparisons in some respects to The Blair Witch Project, although this is a horror movie in a much more different respect.  One death in particular is incredibly shocking, and is very provocative in asking how far will the media go to satisfy the viewer's bloodthirsty needs.  One of the most impressive things though is the movie's sense of humour.  In Connie, they've created one of the most blackly comic characters I've ever seen.
The one thing that is such a shame is that very few people have watched Series 7 and since then more popular movies such as the British My Little Eye and even the awful Halloween Ressurection that have pretty much used the same idea but not to anywhere near as much effect.  Series 7 actually has some ideas in its head and makes some black humour through its satire.  If you're not easily shocked and like your comedy pitch black then this is definitely a movie you should look for.",1036800000,2,1696,4.683501683501683
1633718,1,B00005NGAV,"This ""movie"" had a good premise. Some friends and were talking about all the stupid survivor variants, and I thought  they should make a show where the winner is the only person left living on the island or whatever. No rules. Then 10 minutes later we see this dvd and rent it.
What a [waste of money]. The problem with Series 7 is that the director knows the language of television *so well* that you really feel like you paid to rent a horrible tv show. He has all of the camera moves down perfect, and the stylized ""what will happen next?!?"" bumpers which break up the ""movie"" are exactly what you see on any of these tv shows.
All you need to know is this: It's a kill or be killed survivor tv show that you rent. The acting is horrible, it goes on far too long, it's commentary is painfully obvious, but still sledgehammered.
It was an exercise in making something that might sneak onto tv, you'd stumble on it and be fooled because it looks like tv. So why pay for it? ANY survivor show on tv is better and free.",1035072000,,1018,4.247422680412371
1633719,4,B00005NGAV,"Fans of ""reality"" TV are going to love this one, and even those whose tastes run contrary to such offerings are going to find this indie film a riveting experience.  Like ""Survivor,"" the name of the game here is, well...survival; but with one significant difference from any of the shows you've seen on television:  The winner in ""Series 7, The Contenders,"" written and directed by Daniel Minahan, will be the only one from among the contestants still standing at the end of the show, meaning ""alive.""  Yes, that's right, the object of the game here is to eliminate the opposition, as in ""kill"" them-- by whatever method available.  Guns, knives, bombs, blunt instruments, anything goes; whatever it takes to do in the other guy (or gal).  And it ain't over till it's over, which means when five are dead, and only one remains.
Of the six in contention this week, the returning champion, with ten kills to her credit, is 30ish Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith), who also happens to be eight months pregnant.  She'll be pitted against Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), a nurse; Tony Reilly (Michael Kaycheck) a husband and father of three; Franklin James (Richard Venture), the oldest of the bunch; teen Lindsay Berns (Merritt Wever); and finally, Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald), an ex-boyfriend of Dawn's, who has his own reasons for being in the game.  And so it begins; and the question now is, of the six, which will become the hunters, and which the hunted?  Does Dawn stand a chance of putting five more notches on her scorecard?  Or this week, will one of the other five prevail, and walk away with the cash?  Or, more notably, be the ""one"" who is able to do so.
It was inevitable that this film-- or one like it-- would be made, given the way television has been saturated with ""reality,"" the past few years.  And since it had to happen, at least it was born of, evolved and guided by the artistic capabilities of Minahan, who has crafted and delivered a gripping, thought provoking satire that reaches it's apex of effectiveness hours, or even days, after the film has ended; because for anyone with any scruples at all, this film will linger in the memory like a phosphene caused by rubbing the eye, and it'll take that long to even begin to sort out the myriad implications of it all.  The obvious question/message of the film is, of course, just how far should/could/can society go in this direction before realizing the consequences of the moral turpitude ""reality"" shows must necessarily embrace to be successful.  Minahan does not moralize overtly, however; rather, he very subtly plants the suggestion of what the next step in real life may be within the matter-of-fact presentation and context of his story.  And he does it with such precision that it is not until much later that the full impact of it hits you, and it's then that you understand how extremely appalling and depraved the concept is when extrapolated to the nth degree, as Minahan so aptly illustrates here.
Minahan's approach may be more clever than imaginative, as his film plays out as if it were lifted from the negative of ""Survivor"" or one of it's clones.  But it's cleverness at it's best.  A film cannot seem this true-to-life and entirely natural without a lot of hard work that includes technical knowledge, an eye for detail and an impressive grasp of human nature; Minahan didn't just walk onto the set one day and crank out such an accurate duplication of a ""reality"" show.  It begins with the astute insights Minahan weaves so incisively throughout his screenplay, and culminates in the way he translated it all to the screen.  Watching this film is something akin to watching Jim Carrey early in his career doing Henry Fonda, or Kevin Spacey doing Christopher Walken or Pacino; it's the kind of professional impersonation/interpretation that just doesn't get any better.
What makes it so enthralling is that Minahan so succinctly captures that documentary look and feel of what has become a ""genre"" of television, and like the best of them, he lets you get to know the contestants-- through interviews and ""mini-bios""-- before the bloodbath begins, so that you can pick your favorites and put your money on the one you think has what it takes to win.  He creates a genuine ""sporting event"" atmosphere, which works at the time-- it puts you in the moment and draws you into the action-- but in retrospect, it makes all that has transpired and everything you've witnessed seem even more disconcerting (which is, of course, the idea).  And you realize, finally, that you've been duped into accepting the unacceptable, and moreover, made to believe by some perverse rationalization of thought that it was all right; which in itself is a keen observation of the power of the medium through which it is proffered.
To make the ""reality"" convincing, the performances, of course, had to be convincing; and they are.  Minahan extracts precisely what was needed from his actors to really sell the show, beginning with Brooke Smith's portrayal of Dawn.  This is the central character of the film, so it was imperative that she be especially believable, and Smith pulls it off beautifully.  As you watch her, you never get the feeling that you're watching an actor; in keeping with the documentary feel of the film, this is Dawn, a young, pregnant woman involved in a game of killing for cash.  it's a solid performance, the kind of which is often overlooked or taken for granted precisely because it is so natural.
The supporting cast includes Donna Hanover (Sheila), Angelina Phillips (Doria), Nada Despotovich (Michelle) and Alex Yershov (Nathan).  To call this film pure entertainment would be wrong; to call ""Series 7, The Contenders"" an entertaining indictment against moral sense and sensibility, however, would be accurate.  It's one that's definitely going to make you stop and think; and consider.",1031270400,,5890,4.876753507014028
1633720,1,B00005NGAV,"I can't believe I'm not allowed to give negative stars. This ""satire"" is neither funny, violent or entertaining. It is without a doubt the worst movie I have EVER seen, including porn and home movies. I'd rather watch commercials than this. I can't believe it even got to DVD, or was released for that matter. And as for the commentary....WHAT??? You mean it was all PLANNED?? Even a sitcom about monkey mechanics who spend all day sleeping would be better.

1633768,5,B00005NGAV,"Once in a  long while I see a film that is so beautifully original that I cannot ignore it. This was one such movie. I sat down to watch the first half hour and had to see the rest.
I don't want to go into too much detail since it seems the reviewers above ruined alot of it for you already. Instead I will expand more on what some of them said. One person said he or she enjoyed the fast cuts and flashy editing. The DVD insert explains that the original cut of the film was alot slower. The test audience couldn't get into it and so the filmmaker looked for inspiration. He found it with Fox Sports. He decided to add ridiculously loud and distracting wipes and cuts to add to the drama and suspense.
Someone else suggested that this movie was very similar to Survivor, but this film was actually written about 4 years before Survivor. At that time, the film was inspired by the Real World. And so the filmmakers were truly ahead of their time because, while very exaggerated, their prophecy of what reality TV shows were to come was correct.
I personally don't think the film was very violent. It was more the power of suggestion rather than alot of blood shots and so forth. Series 7 is very cynical, smart and witty. I admire the writer and director who made this and this is definitely someone who loves movies should go see.",1026518400,2,1331,4.3453815261044175

1633770,4,B00005NGAV,"Strictly put, SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS, is an incredible independent film that follows the immoral trail that we're creating with our current television.
Even though it was written well before TV hits like Survivor and Temptation Island, SERIES 7 works even better as it now has a basis to see just how ludicrous television is becoming.  It was shot like a reality television series with cameras following all participants, therefore making it even more realistic.  However, it takes it a step furthur and introduces a RUNNING MAN type senario where the contestants of the game show are almost literally thrown Glock pistols and sent out to kill each other.  The direction of all of this is extremely realistic, sometimes frighteningly so.  One of my friends actually walked in when I was watching the movie and asked what channel the show was on.  Daniel Minahan has done a great job keeping the action realistic and intense.  The ""conversation"" scenes where the characters are talking to the camera are very well done and exude a certain type of ground while being hilarious because of the things that everyone is saying.
At times, the acting is a little cheesy, but this is easily overlooked.  The main actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see how the large supporting cast interacts with them when the cameras are turned onto them.  It all comes down to the big question of, ""Am I on yet?"" whenever they appear on screen.  It basically plays like a more serious Jerry Springer episode.
Minahan should be congratulated for the job he has done here.  This film is very well thought out and very scary when you think about the path that or current television veiwing habits are heading.  Despite a rather falty ending, SERIES 7: THE CONTENDERS, is a well crafted satirical thriller and should be seen by everyone who hates reality TV as well as those who endorse it.",1014595200,2,1875,4.773993808049536

The only unfortunate quality of this film is the fact that it was released at the wrong time. Many if not most will assume that it is a parody of the current reality-based-television craze, but in fact was made before Survivor hit the telivision sets of so many American homes.

1633775,5,B00005NGAV,""" Series 7: The Contenders "" is a very contemporary film.  It seems that the so-called reality shows have caught on world wide. Every country has its own show and also an imported one . Here in Brazil, some main TV channels are fighting for the rights of one show like this. Besides it's on the third version of one of them. I cannot understand how people can spend such a long time in front of a tv set watching such thigs. I myself prefer spend my time reading a good book or watching an interesting movie, like ""Series 7..."".
""Series 7"" is a versitile sell. It can be watched as a drama - very effective, because tacles real life- , as a thriller - nail bitting, once you wonder who's going to be next to die and kill-, and as a comedy - it mocks with a international mania (or would it be hysteria?).
Not only is the film extremelly violent, but it also is very inteligent. The writer/director was very fortunate with his idea. In a nutshell: in a society where killing sounds ordinary, six 'conterders' are select at random to play a reality show. The prize? Life itself. Everyone is supposed to have guns and to protect him or herself. The players are very interesting: a woman about to give birth, an unemployed drug-addicted man, a nurse, a man dying of cancer, a teenager and an old man who we barely know about. If they weren't in this film, each life would give enough material for a film.
The cast director was wise casting actors who looks like people we see on the street and I even thought that everyone was a newcomer- but I checked later and all of them have already worked either on Cinema and TV. By the way, the pregnant girl is nothing but superb.
It is impossible not to start rooting for any of the contenders. As they are introduced the audiences take to the one they like most. But surely not everybody will like the same player. There are conternders for any taste. I chose the pregnant girl. And I hated the teenager and her parents. They were so stupid! The nurse made my flesh creep. The addicted man was to stupid for me even care about him. The sick man says to want to die, so I ""desquilified"" him,- and the old man is not showed vey much. You can notice after few minutes that the star of the show - actualy the film -  is the pregnant woman.
The editing is very smart as well. Short cuts, lots of narration - that never gets boring-, grafics and fast camera work keep the audience 'dying' - pun intended - to know what comes next. The final comfrontation in funny and impreviseable. This twist leads the film to a new level. And in the final sequence another twist shocks everyone. Although I saw it on a movies theatre, I think it fits the small screen just because it really looks like a televion program.
Sensiteve people should avoid this film, because some images really shock and blood is sometimes everywhere. Not only the conterders, but also all people around react very well to the deaths. They seem to be very used to it. Does the film take place in a future time when people are no longer shocked with killing? It loosely reminded me of Orwell's '1984', where everybody is watched by The Big Brother.
Let's hope that this good film is not a profetic one. I mean I hope reality shows on tv don't go this further. If they do, we will be living on a time when life means nothing. Creepy!",1007337600,9,3330,4.352090032154341

7947035,5,B00005NGAV,"""Series 7: The Contenders"" is a blistering take on America's obsession with violence, guns, reality shows -- it's basically ""The Hunger Games"" meets Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery.

In a national television broadcast, five reality contestants are randomly determined by lottery and then given one goal: to kill each other.  They get a pistol, but they can use whatever method necessary to execute each other.  They have no choice in the matter, their only hope being that if they win three tours they go free.

In an uncomfortably prescient parallel to reality, the contest takes place in Newbury CT, just an hour away from Newtown, CT. It takes place there for a reason: it is Dawn Lagarto's (Brooke Smith) hometown, the current reigning champion who also happens to be eight-months pregnant and is on her third tour. The contenders include emergency room nurse Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), ex-boyfriend of Lagarto Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald) who is dying of cancer, unemployed father Anthony Reilly (Michael Kaycheck), retired crank Franklin James (Richard Venture), and 18-year-old student Lindsay  Berns (Merritt Wever).

There are no Hollywood deaths in ""The Contenders.""  The violence is sloppy and ugly, with Reilly using his daughter as a shield, Norman trying to kill himself, Trabucco abusing her access as a nurse to hospitalized contestants, and Berns pumped up by her parents as an overachiever with a gun.  On the one hand, all of the contestants are tabloid headlines: the coward who puts a child at risk in a gun fight, the suicidal shooter, the angel of death nurse, the student who snaps.  But each actor brings a poignancy to their roles as they shamelessly delude themselves into thinking their chosen tactic will work.  In ""The Contenders,"" not even suicide is a guarantee.

But there's one more character in the film that must be mentioned, and that's the reality show production itself.  Throughout we get a nagging sense that something isn't right, and that meta-narrative grows as different characters suffer mysterious wounds (one contestant manages to somehow stab himself in the back) and others scream that the entire show is fixed.  Reality, it seems, isn't all that real.

The conclusion reaches a climactic battle between the final two contestants who do their best to reveal the truth -- and are then co-opted by the show, who uses a reenactment to show what ""actually happened.""  ""The Contenders"" asks you what's worse: a reality show about killing people to survive, or a stage series of executions.  That's what makes it so brilliant and, in our 24/7 news culture, so terrifying.",1390089600,,2640,5.118881118881119

7947037,1,B00005NGAV,"My past brushes with this form of entertainment have been quite pleasant.  Spinal tap, Fear of a Black Hat, and Battle Royale were all just a joy to watch.  And after all, there is no genre more deserving or better suited for parody than reality TV or the sort of documentaries that take their silly subjects far too seriously.

So when I found out there was a movie mocking Reality TV that was written and directed by someone intimately involed in the ludicrous MTV series, Real World, I was more than happy with anticipation at watching it.

Yeah, that happiness lasted all of about three minutes.

My hopes for another enjoyable farce were dashed by an onslaught of horrible writing, horrible directing, and horrible acting. The premise, while intriguing, was undercut by a slipshod production that seemed more like some geek with a new camcorder had enlisted a few friends who had taken acting classes at the local community college and embarked on a weekend to make movie.

At first, I thought the acting was intentionally bad, as a means of making a statement on the artificial manner in which folks on those reality tv shows tend to try too hard to be natural.  You know what I mean, those situations in which the folks know they are on camera and try to overcompensate by actually trying to act as if they aren't acting?  Or those scripted and staged ""interview"" interludes where the principle is seated and provides a juvenile synopsis about what we had just seen.  Well, it turns out the acting wasn't meant as a parody.  It honestly is just horrible.

But as bad as the acting is, the writing was even worse.  Every bit of the dialogue was contrived, none of the situations or plot had an ounce of genuine quality, and the characters were the sort that would have been dreamt up by a student at some night school class on how to be a screenwriter.  All the stereotypes were here:  Fat, semi-literate goombah slob? Check.  Misunderstood misfit tough chick with an attitude: Check.  Sanctimonious, judgmental religious hypocrite? Check.  Barf.

And then, you top off the horrid acting and writing with simple and unecessary foul-ups in continuity and basic logic.  For example, early on the fat semi-literate goombah is in a high-speed chase in which his tires get blown out.  He pulls over to force a standoff, only to have his tires remarkably resurrected.  A Miracle, I tells ya!  Or how about this simple scew up: a woman getting strangled continues to scream, even as her windpipe is crushed and her breathing is cut off.

Personally that is what really messed this thing up.  I can live with bad acting or bad writing if the premise of a movie is good enough.  But when little things like that go by, it shows me that the movie makers were too lazy, too arrogant, or too stupid to pay attention to the details.

And finally, the fact is that when all is done and the movie is over, there isn't any pearl of wisdom or deeper truth to be found.  This isn't a scathing commentary on the trajectory of reality tv more than a leering exploitation.  There's no moral to be had, no resolution, and no ultimate judgment.  In the Running Man (the granddaddy of these reality tv parodies), the ending provided a true moral statement about the complicity of society and entertainment and the people who enjoy such dreck.  But this was more a celebration of the genre.

Just ... sad.",1353369600,,3386,4.64983164983165
7947038,4,B00005NGAV,"Disclaimer:  I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

As if it needed confirmation, 'Series 7: The Contenders' exposes the production methods of reality TV as the artificial manipulations that they are.  To do so, it faithfully incorporates all of the same techniques one might expect from a legitimate reality show, and then reveals them as ham-handed ways to bamboozle viewers by coupling them with the over-the-top premise of having the contestants - or contenders - murder one another to determine the winner of the game.  The violent subject matter should awaken all but the most somnambulant to the voyeouristic traps inherent in the design of the programming, which, through repetition, have seemingly been accepted by the mass of television viewers as valid entertainment.

Released in 2001, 'Series 7' reflects the techniques with which FOX splattered the airwaves in programs such as 'Cops' and 'America's Most Wanted' back in the late 80's.  I haven't watched enough reality TV since then to say for sure, but it seems as though the execution of these types of programs has become even slicker over the years, which is sad to contemplate.  At any rate, 'Series 7' may come off as a little cruder compared to contemporary television, but I felt that by its tight focus on presenting this as if it were a real show - with only a few easy potshots taken - it effectively publicized the shallow nature of a great deal of modern culture.

Unfortunately, it is also probably preaching to the choir - though if only one person were to watch 'Series 7' and then woke up to the manipulation behind these programs, I'm all for it.  The film's biggest weakness, to my mind, is that it makes its point rather quickly - much of the last half of the film feels redundant.  Still, this is probably the best satire of modern American culture that I've seen in some time - violent though.  Pulls few punches.",1320796800,,2040,4.780626780626781
7947039,4,B00005NGAV,"Series 7: The Contenders (Daniel Minahan, 2001)

Daniel Minahan says in the liner notes to Series 7: The Contenders that when he conceived the film in 1995, he had no idea that reality TV would reach the heights of debauchery it had by the time he actually had a finished film in the can in 2001. It's four years later now, and of course things have gotten even stupider in the world of reality television. How long is it before Minahan's twisted idea reaches someone at a network who decides it really is a good idea?

Series 7 is a reality TV parody, as you can probably tell from the above. The show gives us six contenders, each heavily armed, each trying to kill the others and survive in order to get ""freedom."" (We know from the get-go that freedom is an illusion; the survivor goes on to the next season of the show, as the main character here is the champion from Series 6.) That's pretty much all the plot you need; if you've watched a reality TV show, you know exactly what you're going to get here.

Someone like me, who loathes reality TV, was probably Minahan's target audience with this flick, and he did what he did very well. The parody of the stupidity of reality TV is dead on. I'm guessing that those who are fonder of The Real World and Wife Swap than I am are probably going to look at this and say, ""what's so funny?"" The rest of us, though, get it. If you haven't yet seen this and you hate reality TV, see it ASAP. *** ",1131408000,2,1444,4.259124087591241

Those who already see this trend will recognize the genius of Series 7. Those who have blindly fallen into the intellectual and moral vacuum of current media will no doubt find it amusing, but will they see its relevance in the world around them? Oh well, who cares.

7947042,4,B00005NGAV,"More than one commentator has pointed out that Reality TV is the modern-day equivalent of the Romans' Bread and Circuses, in which the proletariat had a great old time watching government-funded gladiators disembowel each other while forgetting all about the decadent misrule of their emperors. Daniel Minahan's ""Series 7: The Contenders"" takes this observation to its logical conclusion: the story concerns a government-sanctioned Reality TV show in which six people are chosen by lottery to hunt and kill each other. The last one standing goes on to the next series, to hunt and be hunted by five new contestants. The current champion in ""Series 7"" is Dawn, a desperate young woman rejected by her family who also happens to be eight months pregnant. She goes back to her home town in Connecticut to face down her new pursuers: an elderly recluse; a timid, devoutly religious nurse; a teenage girl; an unemployed factory worker; and an artist dying of cancer who, it turns out, knows Dawn. What happens to these contenders, and how they interact with each other, is kept continually fresh, surprising and white-knuckle suspenseful by Minahan, who shoots this movie on videotape to give it an absolutely authentic look. He mocks every aspect of the Reality TV phenomenon beyond redemption, from the salacious promos to the cheesy, false sentimentality. The no-name actors in the cast add greatly to the verisimilitude, though all of them deserve to be much better known--particularly Brooke Smith as Dawn, Glenn Fitzgerald as the terminally ill artist, and Marylouise Burke as the nurse, who thinks herself morally superior to Dawn but develops a taste for killing that Dawn never quite achieves.  There are times when Minahan lays on the irony a little too thickly; at one point, the unctuous announcer says that one of the contenders is paralyzed ""by a self-inflicted knife wound to the back.""  And one could also argue that making the show an all-volunteer effort, with contestants who clamor to get massacred just to have their 15 minutes of fame, would have been a more accurate parody of Reality TV. Nevertheless, ""Series 7"" in all is a brilliant satirical sick joke, with a whale of a twist ending that you won't see coming till the very last second. (The DVD includes a lot of deleted scenes, including an alternate ending which--though not as clever as the one Minahan ultimately chose--is every bit as gripping, pertinent, and brutal.)",1106352000,,2446,5.037037037037037
7947043,3,B00005NGAV,"I'll be honest; I find all ""reality"" shows to be exceptionally tedious, and movies about ""reality"" shows even more so (Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen in ""The Challenge""? Bor-ring). This movie, however, was pretty good. Basically, it's 5 people set loose on the streets of Danbury, CT (so close to home!), armed and dangerous (they're issued a 9mm semi-automatic pistol at the start of the show, but it's no-holds-barred from there), and licensed to kill...each other.

One of my favorite scenes was at the mall, where the contestants were all drawn by a phony note. The young girl, ""Lindsay Berns"" (Merritt Wever) not only had her pistol, but an M-16 (semi-auto only), a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun *and* a bulletproof vest (a gift from her boyfriend). She winds up being beaten to death with a metal cane (*severe* head trauma), by the older guy, Franklin James (Richard Venture). He is then shot by Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), who is wielding a sniper's rifle. You won't see *that* on ""Big Brother"" or ""Survivor""!
