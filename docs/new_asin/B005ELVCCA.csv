8468471,5,B005ELVCCA,The DVD arrived on time in good packaging and works great. No complaints whatsoever.,1442188800,,84,5.071428571428571
8468472,1,B005ELVCCA,CD would not play even after cleaning and in two different players.,1420329600,,67,4.666666666666667
8468473,5,B005ELVCCA,"Rare concert footage and previously unseen guitar lessons make this an essential purchase for any Buster completist. However,much of the first half of the DVD has been previously released on an acoustic guitar triple bill(with John Miller/Stefan Grossman) AND the lessons at the end have not been tabbed. So,if you're one of those people who needs the tab to get all the details,this DVD might both delight and annoy you in equal measure. If you don't have the other DVD I've mentioned,this disc is best described as indispensable;the performance of 'Prelude/funky fingers'(recommended for fans of Leo Kottke) is simply worth the price of the disc alone.
Buster is and was a treasure-check him out!",1413244800,,698,5.131578947368421
8468474,5,B005ELVCCA,"Buster was undoubtedly one of the master fingerstyle players who ever lived.  His untimely death robbed us of a magnificent talent. This video is a testament to that talent. Not to be missed.  As Chet Atkins used tosay""he deserves to be heard""",1357603200,,243,4.761904761904762
