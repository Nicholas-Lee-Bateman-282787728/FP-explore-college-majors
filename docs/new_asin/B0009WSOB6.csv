8068664,2,B0009WSOB6,"Price (Patrick McKnight) is in trouble with the police for using a fake credit card. He hides out with his cousin Andre (Dane Hereford) at his frat house, his all gay frat house. The name of the detective in this film is Dick Johnson (Burton Gilliam) and the humor doesn't get any better. The gays are extremely over-the-top stereotypes. There is a scene where they attempt to spoof ""Animal House"" but it lacked humor, as did most of the film.

This is strictly a juvenile amateur attempt. Not worth a rental.  Re-released under the title ""Frat House.""

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word. Near sex. No nudity.",1376697600,,606,4.752380952380952

8068666,3,B0009WSOB6,"I really enjoyed the film and my favorite characters are the fraternity guys or should I say....you'll see for yourself. Rickey Smiley was completely crazy as usual and A. J. Johnson is still nutty. I would recommend this to anyone that likes stories with a ""Twist"".  I get it.",1118448000,2,277,4.653061224489796
