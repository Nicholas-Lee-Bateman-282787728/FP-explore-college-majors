7876006,1,6304687621,I BOUGHT A 2 DVD'S FOR A DOLLAR EACH WITH 3 EPISODES ON EACH. NEVER NAME A DUCK----BANK BOOK 6565696----HUSTLING THE HUSTLER WERE ALL ON ONE WITH EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE OTHER HAD THE NIGHT THE ROOF FELL IN----GIVE ME YOUR WALLS----MANS TEETH  ALSO EXCELLENT QUALITY. THEY WERE BOTH BRAND NEW FROM 2 WELL KNOWN CHAIN STORES.  THESE TAPES ARE ONE BAD JOKE!!!!,1119830400,,357,4.741935483870968
7876007,4,6304687621,"Why can't the people responsible for putting these out put out beeter episodes, I mean the real classic ones.  This show had several: the ghost in the cabin one, or the space-walnut one, or the one where Laura keeps opening Rob's mail.  The one where Laura tells Alan Brady's secret on t.v.  or the best, in my opinion, where Laura and Millie spend a scary night  alone.",951696000,3,370,4.477611940298507
7876008,1,6304687621,"The title of the set is ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", but 4 of the 10 episodes aren't from the Dick Van Dyke show. There are only two episodes per tape (rather skimpy content) and on tapes 2 through 5, one is from Dick  Van Dyke, the other's from ""Make Room for Daddy"" with Danny  Thomas. With 5 tapes in the set (the only information available), I sort of  assumed 15 or 20 episodes and certainly didn't expect some other show. This  is not a recommended buy if you really want a significant portion of Dick  Van Dyke episodes.",945302400,29,524,4.252525252525253
