8527648,5,B008GNKB6G,This was a well made documentary on Brian Epstein. I liked it that there were some little known people who contributed interesting commentary. The sound was a little off but I still enjoyed it.,1514332800,,193,4.705882352941177
8527649,5,B008GNKB6G,I loved this movie. I don't know what it is about Brian but he is just so likeable. As John Lennon said he is a beautiful man. So soft spoken and clear. You can see the pride he had in the Beatles from some clips such as Shea and I just think he is the reason we have the Beatles. If your a Beatles fan this is a must for sure.,1422921600,4,327,3.619718309859155
8527650,3,B008GNKB6G,"Although this is not the best documentary about Brian Epstein, it is really the only one currently available at the moment.  It is good to see that, recently, Brian Epstein has really been celebrated with a whole host of new books (including the excellent new graphic novel, The Fifth Beatles: The Brian Epstein Story, a forthcoming play in London and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Epstein was a fascinating man, whose unwavering support and belief in the Beatles was instrumental in bringing them success, even though the entire music industry at the time was against them.  London ruled the record companies in England and their dislike in looking beyond their own local area was shown when Decca signed Brian Poole and the Tremeloes over the Beatles, mainly because they were based in the South. America were also biased against all English acts and, when they finally achieved a record contract, Capitol Records (owned by EMI) consistently rejected their records; even going so far as threatening record stations when they obtained a copy of I Want to Hold Your Hand, (the record which became their first hit in the States) even though it was by one of their own acts!

Sadly, there is little in this documentary about Brians life before the Beatles.  The bulk of information is about his time as their manager and there are interviews with Sid Bernstein, Bill Harry, Alistair Taylor, Beryl Adams (Brians secretary in Liverpool), Allan Williams, Julia Baird and Tony Sheridan, among others.  Whoever edited the interview footage allowed too many personal grudges to be aired, as well as there being some dubious titles  Richard Porter, bizarrely, presented as a Beatles historian?  Bill Harry once again bemoans the fact that Brian Epstein made the group Pauls, rather than Johns  even though George clearly states in the Anthology documentary that none of the group minded wearing suits and that all were happy with Epstein achieving them greater pay and better organisation.  Frankly, Brian Epstein made them marketable and as groups at that time wore suits, there was really little choice  the Beatles would almost certainly never have been taken seriously or been allowed on television dressed in black leather...

Alistair Taylors personal enmity towards Allan Williams also makes it onto screen, when it would probably have been better toned down.  However, many of these people have lived off their association with the Beatles for many years, so just take into account that those talking have reputations and egos and take much of what is said with a pinch of salt.  If you do want the truth about Epsteins relation with the Beatles, then turn to Mark Lewisohns  new biography, Tune In.  Actually, I recently listened to a podcast where Mark Lewisohn was a guest and I was pleased to hear him say that although Allan Williams has really become a figure of fun in Beatles circles (often his own fault, admittedly) that he was actually very important for the band and that he actually did a lot for them in the early days.

Despite all the faults, it is nice to hear the story from Brian Epsteins point of view.  Sid Bernstein was, as ever, charming and generous when talking about his dealings with Epstein.  Beryl Adams also has some interesting stories about working for NEMs and there are some nice interview snippets and footage of Brian himself.  This is an interesting documentary and worth watching, despite its faults and it is good to see Brian Epstein finally being given some of the credit which was his due.",1398038400,4,3552,4.908026755852843
8527651,3,B008GNKB6G,"If you don't know much about Brian Epstein's central involvement with the Beatles, than this is a good & lively introduction. But if you know a lot him, and them, there's not much new here. Good for collectors, I'd say, but it breaks no new ground.",1220659200,2,248,4.413043478260869
8527652,4,B008GNKB6G,"i was excited to see that a DVD is out with the story of the fifth Beatle.i had seen a BBC documentary based on Debbie Gellers book ""the Brian Epstein story"" and it was really fantastic. unfortunately this one on sale here is not as complete as the other -not in sale- documentary.the reasons are:

not any Bealte is interviewed, the production is a little ""poorish"", and it just doesnt tells the full story.

i gave 4 stars because this is the only DVD opportunity for those who like to have something about Brians life.

i really wish that the BBC documentary will soon go on sale.

this one is for only die hard Brian Epstein fans. don't miss it if you love the fifth Beatle.",1127347200,7,678,4.357142857142857
8527653,3,B008GNKB6G,"It's silly to call Epstein ""the First Beatle.""  He never played with them; he was just their manager.  Would anybody call Culture Club's manager a first member?  Would the Eurythmics' manager have been a third member?  No.

Besides that, this documentary was generally good.  When one hears that Epstein faced homophobia and anti-Semitism, struggled with alcoholism and gambling, and committed suicide, one might deem him tragic.  However, in this documentary, he is revealed to be polished and innovative.  Along with Jean Genet, Billy Strayhorn, Bayard Rustin, and many others, Epstein is a gay man who backed up some of the most important straight men in history.  Musicians of that era openly admit their debt to him.  For those how love mod fashions and black-and-white ""American Bandstand""-like shows, you will love the images here.

This documentary is filled with British individuals with stereotypically ""bad"" teeth.  Even Epstein did not have a nice set of chompers.  There have been documentaries where Paul McCartney addressed whether he and John Lennon were ever lovers, but no Beatle is interviewed currently for this work.  That is a grave disappointment, and a possible sign of a lack of gratitude.  This film does dismiss rumors that Epstein loved Lennon.  Thus, the film ""The Hours and Times"" may be incorrect, or purposely ambiguous.  I have heard clips of Lennon saying homophobic things to interviewers but his possible bigotry is not mentioned in this documentary.",1114041600,3,1486,5.228813559322034
