So buy the ""Mutual Restored 90th Anniversary Edition"" instead of this edition.",1151107200,,280,5.363636363636363
7883684,4,6305075530,"First of all, I am actually reviewing The Chaplin Mutuals, Vol. 2 DVD, not a vhs tape or collection. I'm expecially NOT reviewing any videotapes by the Madacy corporation, which are very poor quality, difiicult to watch, and an embarassment to the Chaplin legacy.
Anyways, to the DVD in question. These four short films have been carefully restored by Davis Shepherd, and it shows. The prints are well done, there is footage restored that had been missing for years, the image is sharp, and most of the film flaws have been minimized as much as humanly possible without detracting from the film itself.
Sadly, these are amongst the first dvds produced, and the quality of the video compression leaves something to be desired. Zooming in on the image at all produces an appalingly distorted picture. People with high-definition tv sets may notice a lot of compression artifacts in the picture. These faults are not the fault of David Shepherd - the discs simply need updating, which is sadly unlikely since they probably don't sell that well.
But the material on the dvd is fantastic. The films are mostly very funny, though you have to adjust your tastes a bit for the humor of 1916 - 1917.
You can't do much better than this for Chaplin! (Oh, and by the way, you can find a variety of cheaper Chaplin collections. Be warned, though, that they are a vastly inferior product, with poor film quality, terrible soundtracks, and even worse video compression! You money should go to these excellent restorations!)",1015200000,6,1508,4.848837209302325
