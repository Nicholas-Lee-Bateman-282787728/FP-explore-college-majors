8755655,2,B01DEAFX3Q,"This is decidedly short measure: Only 52 minutes on a Blu-ray that can hold 3-4 hours.
What happened? Just for starters, his wife, Felicia Montealegre  is never mentioned; nor is his partner,
Tom Cothran, for whom he left her. Bernstein's homosexuality, such an essential part of being? Not even alluded to. Aside from personal stuff, two other very important figures in Bernstein's musical development are not covered: Fritz Reiner, was his conducting teacher at Curtis, whose precision and technical control was a balancing influence to the much freer style of Serge Koussevitzky; yet Fritz R. is totally left out.  Lenny's piano teacher Isabelle Vengerova, about whom Lenny himself has said: ""I owe her an enormous debt"" ---also goes unmentioned. I am sure other reviewers can add many other important things that might stretch out this ""documentary"" to a respectable length. I was just getting into the disc when it ended...all too soon. The family estate could have done a lot better than this short, sketchy production.",1534896000,,1025,5.168674698795181

8755658,5,B01DEAFX3Q,"This ranks as one of best music documentaries Ive seen this year. Produced by a company called Bernhard Fleisher Moving Images in 2015 but just released, the 52 minute film covers the highlights of Bernsteins career as both conductor and composer (and early TV icon and educator).  Obviously this was authorized by the Bernstein Estate as there are wonderful interviews with his two daughters and his son. Bernstein students Marin Alsop and Kent Nagano give their thoughts and the two Broadway Steves (Stephen Sondheim and Stephen Schwartz) are featured as well  all in new interview sequences. A short early bio comes first and then  through some wonderful video clips  we see Bernstein doing conducting  as well as hearing his own comments. There are some clips from his Young Peoples Concerts TV show  with Lenny singing the lyrics to a Beatles song and one from The Kinks! This will appeal to both those who knew Bernstein as a classical music person as well as those who love his Broadway and film scores.
The bonuses consist of additional interviews totaling 24 minutes.
For squeezing a long life in music into less than an hour, Director Georg Wubbolt gets a lot of credit.
By the way, - though it is in English, some interviewees speak in other languages, but the subtitles are easy to read.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8755659,5,B01DEAFX3Q,"There is so much to like and to love about this very personal and intimate view of Bernstein the conductor and person.  While not very long (just under an hour plus bonus material) I have seen few documentaries that give you a sense of who the man was and, ultimately, a longing for the chance to have known him. If I picked up on three main aspects to LB's life as emphasized in this film I think they are these: Bernstein the teacher at heart who loved and admired the young; Bernstein the proud Jew who, never the less, questioned virtually all matters of religion and who found his muse in Mahler (it is made clear that Bernstein, perhaps more than any other, who championed Mahler's music at a time when most of Europe considered it overblown and unworthy of attention) and, lastly, Bernstein who wanted and needed fame and whose talents as a composer never did equal or overcome his fame and talent as a conductor. I cannot recommend this film by Bernhard Fleischer enough. I challenge you to not be moved by the closing footage of the frail, dying maestro with strains of his Mahler in the background. Whether you think you know and love Leonard Bernstein's work and legacy or not so much, I am convinced you will see a side of the man you were not aware of.",1466726400,8,1265,4.452586206896552
