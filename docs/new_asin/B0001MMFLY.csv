2017257,5,B0001MMFLY,"It's the 70's and a film with no special effects budget, but thanks to Jimmy Sangster's writing, som above average camera work, and very capable acting, you get a solid and engaging story of a girl predestined to be the devil's bride. Definitely a lost gem in the sub-genre.

My only complaint is the video quality is very poor. Would love to see someone come in and clean up a print of this.",1352246400,4,392,4.36986301369863
2017258,5,B0001MMFLY,"This is a rare hidden gem.  The story line is gripping.  The acting is superb.  The cinematography and framing of scenes is more cinematic than tv pilot.  The wardrobe and styling is incredible.  For the 70's obsessed, this is a MUST-SEE.",1351900800,3,238,4.7073170731707314
2017259,5,B0001MMFLY,"I love the old made-for-tv movies from the 70's.  When I was a kid I used to look forward to scary films and this one fits the bill.

It has romance, boy meets girl and falls in love with girl with a strange background. It has all the creepiness reminiscent of the Omen trilogy.  Anyone who likes horror will like this.",1317513600,2,319,4.19672131147541
2017260,2,B0001MMFLY,"GOOD AGAINST EVIL is an odd film whose structural strangeness is only partially explained by the fact that it's actually a failed television pilot and not a standalone film at all.  Theoretically, this should have been a decent film: the director (Paul Wendkos, GIDGET) and writer (Jimmy Sangster, multiple Hammer horror films) both have many successful credits to their name.  However, it's the limitations in the pilot format which prevent the film from being viable as a standalone work and the inherent problems within the idea itself which presumably prevented the film from ever progressing beyond a pilot.

The film begins in the New York City of 1955. A baby is born, and Satan is all over it. Appearing in the form of a black cat, he kills the mother (after first messing with her mind via jerky camera work, strange intercutting and spooky incidental music) and then oversees a weird Satanic ritual, the subject is, of course, the newborn.

We then jump forward to the present day (the present day circa 1977). The tainted child has grown up, but is oblivious to the evil that lurks either within her or very near to her (we're a little vague on the exact theology here). She is now is a successful designer in the California fashion industry (one of the morals of our story is that the fashion industry is filled with Satan worshipers). As she joins our story, her parked car is sideswiped by the film's hero and his deliberately ramshackle van.

Since this is a movie, this minor traffic incident results in a continuing stalking situation, which only relents when the Satan Lady (Elyssa Davalos) agrees to date our hero (Dack Rambo) after several long instances of his Not Getting The Hint.  After a long and painful courtship (which must take about half of the film's running time) the romance takes a wild turn when -- just before their marriage -- the Satan Lady is hypnotized, kidnapped and taken to New Orleans.  Rambo's attempt at rescue involves an exorcism, a vandalized church and a young Kim Cattrall.

It's difficult to judge GOOD AGAINST EVIL as a standalone piece of television because it was originally supposed to be only the first chapter in a continuing story.  That possibly explains why the main conflict isn't even hinted at until halfway through.  One has to make allowances for the fact that the last twenty minutes appear to come from nowhere (it's all setup for the series).  The courtship takes longer to establish because the producers need to have this initial meeting and romance to drive the action -- not just for the remainder of the film -- but for an entire TV series.  While these pacing issues are understandable, they do not make for an enjoyable viewing experience.  The totality of what we have is mostly a mess.

While one could see some small potential in GOOD AGAINST EVIL as a series, it's not difficult to see why the pilot didn't set the world on fire.  Foremost of its sins is that there is an hour in the middle that is intensely boring.  Given that this was supposed to air on broadcast television I was beginning to wonder if the producers were relying on advertising breaks and news updates to liven up the action.  We're halfway through the film before any kind of urgency is implemented; I can't imagine many in the audience simply having the required patience.

And while its an intriguing premise, it isn't immediately obvious to how a series would proceed.  Would every episode begin with Richard Lynch moving his victim to another city and end with Dack Rambo teaming up with a bad-tempered priest to perform an exorcism on Kim Cattrall's daughter?  Would the Satan Lady be catatonic in every scene?  Would Satan's army of house cats be a recurring element?

Questions, alas, for which there are no answers.",1223078400,3,3775,4.766513056835637
2017261,2,B0001MMFLY,"Honestly, the first time I watched this movie was at night, half awake, and I had to watch it again the next day to be sure I had seen what I thought I had. The reviewer who stated this was a pilot for a show was a big help, I couldn't comprehend why the movie took such a side turn to the story with Kim Cattrall's kid! Dan O'Herlihy's entrance to the story was hysterical (his opening line is the title above). Dack Rambo's character is so obnoxious I can't believe his would-be girlfriend didn't have him arrested for stalking her. The opening sequence was good, and as stated above Richard Lynch is calmly creepy as Satan on Earth, but the subplot (or maybe it was the main plot?) was out of left field. And then it just ends. WTH? This was in a collection of 16 horror classics I received for Christmas, and worth watching once, I suppose, but otherwise forget it.",1218844800,3,869,4.337423312883436
2017262,1,B0001MMFLY,"Good Against Evil (Paul Wendkos, 1977)

You'd think that a Satanist, and one who's been charged with watching over the devil's daughter, would know the difference between the pentacle and a pentagram. That is, unfortunately, only the least of the woes to be found in Paul Wendkos' depressingly boring non-thriller.

It's tough to give a synopsis without spoilers, since the actual plot of the film doesn't actually start until about forty-five minutes into the movie, but it involves a writer (Dallas' Dack Rambo) and a fashion designer (Elyssa Davalos, who recently appeared in Nancy Drew) who fall in love and, after a long and tortuous (for the viewer, anyway) courtship, decide to get married. The priest who is tabbed to perform the ceremony (John Harkins), however, has some doubts, fearing the girl to be possessed by the devil. Once the truth comes out, it's time to exorcise the devil!

Wendkos may have done some excellent film work in the 1960s (the Gidget films and Guns of the Magnificent Seven are his work), but watching this gives no evidence. Jimmy Sangster's brutally bad script is pushed along by a whole lot of wooden acting (including a young Kim Cattrall in her first TV appearance; she's gotten better at the whole acting thing over the years). There's just nothing about this movie to recommend going out of your way to watch it; for that matter, there's nothing to recommend watching it if it falls into your lap. *",1209427200,,1440,4.845528455284553
2017263,2,B0001MMFLY,"This was meant as a pilot film, being an initial sequence for a projected television series that did not come about, and it is quite clear why it was not found to be acceptable, since it is immensely uninventive, with both its format and attitudes plainly copied from William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST, released but a few years prior, and the 1968 ROSEMARY'S BABY, directed by Roman Polanski.  Two primary threads are woven into the narrative, the first relating the efforts of one Mister Rimmin (Richard Lynch), who is in fact Astaroth a Grand Duke of Hell, to breed with a young woman, Jessica (Elyssa Davalos), who has been reared and protected by a coterie of Satanists from infancy through her 22nd year (the present), with an objective to produce a child that will rule the world in favour of The Forces Of Evil.  Since Satan and his court, whose acolytes are legion, may readily mate with any number of women at any time that they choose, there seems to be little point in Rimmin tarrying for Jessica.  However, such flaws in logic are matched with those of risible continuity issues.  The second principal theme in the plot is of the soap opera variety, a blithely groundless love affair between Jessica and a young man, Andy (Dack Rambo) whose romantic role in Jessica's life upsets the Duke of Darkness no end.  His attempts to interfere with the budding relationship of the young lovers is empty of those cunning components that are requisite for films of the ""Thriller"" genre.  The original television airing was for only 72 minutes, and the reason is revealed by an ongoing spate of orchestral crescendi along with fades indicating arrival of commercial interruptions.  The release in the DVD format adds about 25 minutes, with little overall improvement, because of uninspired parallel editing that fails to engage a viewer with either of the contrasting storylines.  There is even an exorcism here, in spite of its having little significant connection to the narrative but rather a bit more with the Friedkin film that it partially apes.  Direction seems to be unfocussed, and few able acting turns are to be found; nonetheless Richard Lynch, playing Astaroth as earthling, is impressive as ever.  The film ends abruptly, with some lead-in dialogue to subsequent chapters that did not occur, an unsatisfactory finish to a work that is rapidly paced, easy to watch, and easy to forget.  There are a good many such minor productions being reissued with fresh packaging to cash in on the burgeoning popularity of DVDs.  This one should probably have remained wherever it was mouldering.",1161216000,6,2596,4.928899082568807
8014934,1,B0001MMFLY,"The film opens in 1955 with the birth of a daughter under dubious circumstances. The mother dies, it is a cat thing and we jump 22 years later to Jessica (Elyssa Davalos) a dress designer in San Francisco, a dead Satanic give-away, although Jessica doesn't know anything about this. It would seem the Dark Lord would simply occupy a willing person that designated someone who grows up clueless and doesn't want the gig. I don't write this stuff. Andy (Dack Rambo) runs into Jessica and falls in love in about three dates (not 10) and realizes something is wrong because of an old building has a draft and enlists the help of a couple of priests...cheaper than fixing the furnace.

This was a TV pilot film for ABC in 1977 which would have had a long train of ""Exocist"", ""Omen"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" type episodes without Ave Satani, Tubular Bells, or Carmina Burana. The music made the films. This film was boring as hell. Available on some multi-film discs.",1491264000,,958,4.668639053254438
8014935,5,B0001MMFLY,"In the 70's the networks had great original movies of the week and they were better than most movies made for
big screen and that is still true today with all the garbage made by Hollyweird! This was suppose to be a pilot
for a TV series and was never made and you can tell because the ending was left open to continue the plot.
Richard Lynch great character actor is here in all his evil glory. Actor Rambo does a good job in his lead
role and Davalos is also very good and then Kim Catrell comes in for the final scenes and she's okay too.
The movie is well written and directed and moves at a good pace with some creepy scary moments. No
there isn't blood gore and things jumping out at the screen with CGI effects for those who need that to
enjoy a movie and by the comments of some lame critics I see that is the case. This would have made
a terrific series and it should have been but this movie is a top notch TV thriller for fans of TV movies.",1478995200,,951,4.037037037037037

8014939,4,B0001MMFLY,"When I was a teenager, I read books with this type of setting and characters by the ton. I had to clean the house from top to bottom, got my allowance (I'd be embarrassed to say how paltry it was!) and head right down the street to a place called Merrick Paperbacks. I stopped in there every day after school, and mentally noted what my haul would be on Saturday. If a movie turned up with such a theme, I was in Heaven. Good Against Evil is just that kind of movie, and I adored every minute of it.

The best movie I've ever seen? Hardly -- but most assuredly one that I'll be back to watch again. I only wish this pilot had actually been made into a series! :(",1422748800,2,662,4.0534351145038165
8014940,4,B0001MMFLY,"I saw this as most of you have/will on a ""on the cheap"" DVD collection that I picked up at a drugstore. I read a review that stated, ""Some of you may remember a television series called Good vs. Evil ..."" well, there was no TV series, so you could refer to this in 70's TV vernacular as a 'busted pilot'. Before you just blow this off, consider the cast includes the always menacing Richard Lynch, doing good work as usual, Dan O'Herlihy, a solid character actor you've seen 100 times, who is always worth watching, and a young (Sex in the City) Kim Cattrall -- extremely watchable here! Her star quality came through even at this early point in her career. John Harkins, an actor I haven't seen before is very good as  Father Wheatley. The biggest problems, the movie tends to lose it's focus & meander a little, and a bigger problem still, is Dack Rambo. Rambo, may have been, and probably was a great guy in real life, but on film he comes across as cold & annoying cocky. Any time I've seen him, here or years later, it's pretty much the same. But the film itself has genuinely scary & creative moments among the usual TV movie drek. And you have nice San Francisco locations, and a wealth of character actors doing colorful bits, like you used to see back then in tons of TV movies & series, but no more. I'm giving it a 4! It doesn't deserve it, but what the hell.",1392249600,,1370,4.310077519379845

There was no point to it.  What kind of woman would even consider marrying a grown man after only knowing him for 3 weeks, who lives in his van and doesn't have a job?  She doesn't think it's a bit weird that she's still a virgin in that day and age? Does he always have to wear that same sweater? What's with the murderous gang of cats?  A truly silly pilot, laughable.",1382659200,,522,4.319587628865979
