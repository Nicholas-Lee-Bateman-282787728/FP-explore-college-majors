8598997,4,B00DY8YI30,"This is a fun little movie in a vein similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dave/dp/B0030G0BYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dave</a>"" (Kevin Klein) but with a distinctive Italian twist. Claudio Bisio (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mediterraneo-Claudio-Bigagli-Diego-Abatantuono-NTSC-Region-0-Import/dp/B004P0IRHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mediterraneo - Claudio Bigagli, Diego Abatantuono (NTSC Region 0 - Import)</a>) is hilarious as the countrified, underachieving protagonist whose bucolic life is interrupted when the Italian Parliament unwittingly elects him President of the Republic. Smarting from this unintended consequence of their machinations, the three corrupt politicos who precipitated the electoral farce find him at his favorite fishing hole where they explain that he need only accompany them to Rome to attend Parliament, where he can graciously resign (and return to his trout-fishing buddies back home). At the penultimate moment, the President-elect changes his mind and accepts the position, much to the shock of his audience. Hilarity ensues.

Following a rocky start and a corresponding slip in public opinion, the new president gradually applies his own common sense to the tasks at hand, notwithstanding repeated attempts by the three conspirators to sink his plans, his grown son's schemes to wrangle a patronage job, and his own clumsiness in negotiating his new residence's halls, let alone the `halls of power.' Along the way, he becomes enamored of the young female staffer who serves as his much harried protocol handler. Moments after they confess their mutual attraction (a bit of a comedic leap in its own right), things devolve into a somewhat incongruous in-bed-but-mostly-dressed slapping scene with the mild S&M action played entirely for laughs. A belief that with great power comes a great need to be soundly spanked apparently serves as one premise of Italian political comedy.

In the end, it all turns out for the best; political corruption is thwarted (for a day or two at least), evil doers repent, and even the Italian people take each other to task for their own lapses. The president dissolves Parliament, resigns his post, and a wedding proposal is tendered and accepted.

Ironically, Benvenuto Presidente was produced by RAI-TV, Italy's government-supported public television service, and had the support of both Parliament and the office of the President.

Maybe the `emperor' really does have `new clothes!'",1424304000,,2543,6.075208913649025
