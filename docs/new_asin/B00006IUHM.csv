1777690,5,B00006IUHM,This series portrays how life really was in the British Channel Islands during WWII - good actors and very realisitic scenes.  So enjoyed this series.,1221782400,2,150,5.0
1777691,1,B00006IUHM,"I gotta tell you this BBC movie put me to sleep.  What a horrible boring film. (Volume 2).  Really they want me to believe that the germans sent their fancy car around to help a british woman with her sick daughter.  You must be kidding.  IT was an occupation but this film seems preoccupied with how 'nice' some of the german officers were. Revisionist history... You know those SS and german officers weren't all that bad. IT made me sick.

I don't recommend it at all.",1175904000,10,471,4.430232558139535
1777692,5,B00006IUHM,"My sole objection was that the German characters were so ""British"" -the producers should have used German actors with subtitles-speaking to each other in German, and to the Islanders in German accented English. Will there be a Series 3? Seems not-I think the 2 Series go back to the 1970s.",1142294400,11,289,4.8
1777693,5,B00006IUHM,"Is there a third series and if so when is it coming out?

Enemy at The Door shows the complex and human side of the Nazis occupation of the Chanel Islands. The entire series is compelling viewing and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in WW2 in the European Theatre.",1135900800,11,281,4.30188679245283
1777694,5,B00006IUHM,This was one of the best series on World War II that I have ever seen.  The characters showed that there were good and bad people on both sides.  The complex issues of dealing with the occupying forces along with the daily one of getting enough food and keeping warm and prevention of diseases in a weakened population was was certainly realistic.  Excellent!,1042416000,34,359,4.666666666666667
1777695,5,B00006IUHM,"This set continues the series that is a must watch for everyone. Not only do you feel the deprivations,hardships, and fears of the Islanders (from Guernsey), but you understand that all the Germans in WWII were not the same. Because the island is self-contained, it's almost as though you can understand  the ramifications of what it would have been like if Germany had won this war.  You also feel what it's like to be ""occupied"".  In spite of this oppression, one also comes to respect some of the German officers, and sees the progression of the occupying SS officer's downfall into pure evil as he makes choices that hurt everyone, but most of all himself.
  My husband and I could not stop watching this and feel it is one the most eye-opening, thought-provoking series we have ever seen.  We're hoping there is a series 3.  Watch this(after you have seen series 1)-you can't go wrong.",1038787200,53,890,4.703225806451613
1777720,4,B00006IUHM,Excellent season Two. It did get a little slow in parts. Would of liked to see another season to see the Brits being liberated.,1353974400,,127,4.333333333333333
1777721,4,B00006IUHM,"Having been impressed by the first season on DVD, I anticipated giving Series 2 another 5-star review. The script and dramatization deserve five stars, but there are significant sound problems on disc 1 of Series 2. Even at volume level 50 on disc one, some of the female actors can hardly be heard, and even the voices of male actors wax and wane, apparently with distance from scarce microphones on the set. Fortunately, the episodes on disc 2 seem (so far) not to have that problem. Another annoyance, not encountered in the first series, is the periodic ""commercial break"" in each episode, when the viewer endures staring at a static illustration for a minute or two, three times during the episode. How hard would it have been to eliminate those breaks from this second series of discs? However, Series 2 carries on a nuanced examination of German occupation and civilian life in the Channel Islands during WWII, established in Series 1. Despite the sound issues on disc 1 of Series 2, and the annoyance of the commercial breaks, I highly recommend both series.",1344729600,,1066,4.830601092896175
1777722,5,B00006IUHM,It arrived in good condition and promptly.  I have not yet had a chance to watch it but saw Season I and loved it!,1334275200,,114,3.75
1777723,3,B00006IUHM,"The series seems reasonably interesting till the turn at the start of series two when Claire Martel, the most interesting character, the feisty one who seemed to be the only one to understand that the Germans were the enemy, becomes catatonically depressed because she killed one of them in series one.  The most undramatic, uninteresting thing the script writers copuld have done.  Turned me off the series altogether.",1326585600,4,419,5.147058823529412
1777724,5,B00006IUHM,"You get the sense of how stressful it was to live under occupation, especially when you are use to human rights and the rule of law. I enjoyed the series immensely. I highly recommend it.",1320796800,,187,4.371428571428571
1777725,5,B00006IUHM,"I am enthralled with this series.  The plots are intriguing as well as reasonable.  The strength and endurance of the isalanders is a tribute to what the english people are made of.  On the German side, it lets us see the humanity of some of those in command, instead of every german being a viscious monster.  It's food for thought that these men had lives as professionals and family men before the war, just as those who fought them had.  I sincerely hope that the series will continue through the end of the war and after.  To let us see what the fate of all the main characters were.",1320364800,,588,4.348623853211009
1777726,5,B00006IUHM,"I would consider myself almost an authority on WW2 movies having to watch them when I was a kid with my brother and now with my husband.
This Series 2 of Enemy at the Door, and also Series 1 were among some of the best I have viewed,too bad they didn't continue the series up until the germans had to leave the island.",1280016000,5,318,4.063492063492063
1777727,5,B00006IUHM,"I loved this series. I had rented season one and the place didn't have season 2. I had to find out what happened. I didn't know about these British Islands that were occupied but the people lived almost in harmony with the Germans. Sure there were rules and cerfews, food shortages.

It showed a range of personalities of the Germans. The one leader was actually kind and got along with the towns people great. One SS man was out to hurt anyone he could. They did send some away to prison for harboring fallen piolets of the NAF and some other crimes.

It was exciting at times and it showed just how daily life was. These people were not inbattle but they did suffer much. Highly recommend to any WWII history buffs.",1259539200,,717,4.424242424242424
1777728,5,B00006IUHM,"This series is a gripping account of Germany's occupation of the Channel Islands during WW II.  As compelling as this series is, it does not paint the Nazi officers with a broad brush; not all of them wanted to be there, or involved in the war for that matter.  It also follows the lives of a handful of families living under stringent rules and the fear that many citizens had concerning losing their homes, limited rations of food (their farms were co-opted by the Nazis to feed their soldiers), and potential loss of life.

The series also depicted the work ""farms"" where POWs were virtual slaves with very little to eat and sometimes not even that.  Many of the POWs succumbed under these stark and harrowing circumstances.  Desperate times call for desperate measures and the desperation shown in this series is heart-breaking.

This is a well-written, well-acted series and I recommend it to all who want to know what life was like in an occupied land during WW II.",1249862400,,971,4.715976331360947
1777729,1,B00006IUHM,"I'm unhappy with this order since it still hasn't arrived and
it has been a month now.  I've been informed it was sent
'media mail' whatever that is, but this is ridiculous.  No
further word from the seller at this point.",1245974400,3,221,4.365853658536586

7969594,4,B00006IUHM,"first season the best, but still entertaining.",1430697600,,46,5.714285714285714
7969595,5,B00006IUHM,"Both series, one & two of ""Enemy at the Door"" were so realistically filmed that the viewer feels as if he or she is actually present in each scene.  The character development was beyond description!  We will be viewing both series over and over.  For all WWII history buffs, and even if you aren't, you don't want to miss this.  So much information about the little discussed German occupation of the British Channel Islands.  The British had such unbelievable courage and fortitude, both on the islands and on the mainland.  Truly unforgettable.  So proud of our British heritage!",1409788800,,581,4.86734693877551
7969596,5,B00006IUHM,Truly great.  American TV can only aspire to this.,1409184000,,50,4.555555555555555
7969597,5,B00006IUHM,since i followed this series on tv - i had to get the ending dvd's as the tv did not carry the 2nd set.  loved this series.,1390608000,,123,3.5555555555555554
7969598,5,B00006IUHM,"After having viewed season 1 from Netflix and being disappointed that season 2 was not available from Netflix, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is a fine serial to watch and shows a almost forgotten tale of WW2.",1377907200,,219,4.341463414634147
7969599,5,B00006IUHM,"Although the movie is old, we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The situations seemed real, the characters/actors believable. You got a feeling of the stress they endured living with a brutal enemy.",1365465600,,188,5.266666666666667
7969600,5,B00006IUHM,"This older tv series has a charm about it that I found appealing.  It held my attention throughout with its independent stories around a central theme: continuity of characters, island setting and WWII historical period.",1360454400,,220,5.285714285714286
7969601,4,B00006IUHM,"It is the continuation of the first season.  We've come to know all the main characters quite well and at times can sympathize with both sides except for the German SS officer, who is so hateful.  It's a part of WWII that not many people know about.  We visited Guernsey while on a cruise and very much enjoyed walking around the town and took a tour of the countryside.  There are still many German bunkers left in the hills and we were told a bit about the Occupation by our tour guide who said his parents lived through that period.  We are looking forward to the Third Series.",1358035200,,580,4.333333333333333
7969602,5,B00006IUHM,"Portrays an interesting story of a little known aspect of World War II. Well acted, well written. Highly recommend this series.",1354579200,,127,5.095238095238095
