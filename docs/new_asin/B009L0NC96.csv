5346087,5,B009L0NC96,"From what I see of the other reviews, NS#13 is going to be the number 1 must-have set of the entire series so far as it begins the real war with Pain, the Akatsuki leader(s).  But what really knocks me out is the awesome package cover, which is a significant departure from other NS package covers, which usually show Naruto, Sasuke, or one of Leaf Village jonin.  On the cover of #13, though, is Hinata Hyuga fighting some sort of skeletal dragon.  And when you remember Hinata as the painfully shy and plain looking girl utterly lacking in self confidence that she was in the first Naruto series, you realize what a great way she has come as a shinobi (and she's not so plain looking anymore either).  I suppose Hinata got the honor of promoting NS#13 because she's actually the first of the Leaf shinobi to face off against Pain.  It's a battle reminiscent of her fight with Neji way back when in that she has no real chance of victory, but she bravely fights with all her strength for the sake of her love for Naruto.  Never fear, she ultimately survives.",1355702400,5,1059,4.461139896373057

Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

5346132,5,B009L0NC96,"A bit of a review for this set, based in part on some sci-fi that the events on the discs remind me of.

Disc 1--So, a young man goes to a far-off place, where he's trained by a wizened, green, frog-man who makes him eat strange foods and whacks him with a cane a lot. Yeah, reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back. Kinda waiting for them to tell us that Tobi is really Minato, and that Sakura is really Naruto's sister.

Yeah, I'm trying to be a bit silly here. Enjoy the humor on the disc, because starting towards the end of it, and going on for a while, the yucks become precious few. Understand, that's not a complaint, just noting that the story gets very intense very quickly.

Disc 2--With most movies and shows, we have to practice what's called ""suspension of disbelief"", mainly meaning that when an important character is in danger, we may know that nothing very bad is going to happen to them, but have to essentially pretend that it might in order to enjoy the suspense. For me, the movie Serenity blew through that, because as it was building up to the ending conflicts, it succeeded at making me think that no character, no matter how major, was safe, that any or all of them may not make it to the end credits.

Starting with this disc, and going over into the next, I started having much the same feeling. No one was safe, anything could happen to anyone. The costs are high, and then as the last episode on this disc is ending, the destruction reaches a cataclysmic scale.

Disc 3--This disc simply didn't remind me of any particular sci-fi movie. If anything, the episodes reminded me most of the first Shippuden story arc, when Gaara defended the Sand Village from an attack by Deidara. Now, it's Naruto's turn to fight for his village, and the similarities between him and Gaara are striking.

But it looks to not be enough, which brings us to ""Confessions"", an absolute gem of an episode. One of the main features of this invasion by Pain is how no one in the village will give up Naruto, no matter how much damage Pain inflicts. And it's no surprise that Naruto fights for the village. But there is a special poignancy when one little character, one of the few who's been on Naruto's side since episode 1, comes to his aid when Pain seems to have the upper hand, because of what he has come to mean to her.

And concerning where the set ends, well, if it's a good idea to end a serial story like this at a cliffhanger, ending this set where they did had to be a no-brainer. Well played, Viz, well played.

In short, if you're a fan of the series, this set won't disappoint at all.",1370563200,5,2602,4.372670807453416

5346143,5,B009L0NC96,"He is responsible for killing Jiraiya.

He is responsible for killing jinchuriki and stripping away

His name is Nagato otherwise known as Pain and the controller of six corpses which are controlled by chakra and are known as the Six Paths.

And they are members of the Akatsuki, that are hell bent in destroying the leaf village?

But how is it possible as Nagato and a few others were peaceful children that were once trained by Jiraiya and was possibly considered as the prophecy?  How did he become evil?

In ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"", Jiraiya's master Fukasaku takes Naruto to Mount Myoboku to learn ""Sage Mode"", meanwhile back in the Hidden Leaf Village, an autopsy is underway to study the captured Pain that Jiraiya defeated, in hopes to find a weakness.  Meanwhile, Shikamaru and Shiho try to decode Jiraiyas message.

But while Naruto is out training, the Akatsuki Sixth Path and Konan attacks the Leaf Village in order to try and capture the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.

Causing so much destruction and death, can anyone defeat Pain?

What is ""Naruto""?

Since 1999, ""Naruto"" created by Masashi Kishimoto (""Karakuri"") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.

For the anime series, since 2002, ""Naruto"" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes. The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.

Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities. The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need. But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.

Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities. For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions. He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older. Of course, there is so much involved in the ""Naruto"" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series.

In ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"", Season 8 of ""Naruto: Shippuden"" continues as the Six Paths and Konan attack the Leaf Village in their hopes of capturing Naruto in order to obtain the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.

With so much death and destruction, Kakashi along with Chouji Akimichi and his father Chouza take on the most powerful of the Six Paths.  Meanwhile, in Mount Myoboku, Fukasaku trains Naruto to become one with nature and learn Sage Mode.  But will Naruto learn and master Sage Mode in a short amount of time to take on the Six Paths?

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Naruto Shippuden"" is an anime series that was never known for having spectacular background art, but it's know for its action and its characters and how it captures emotion and its intense battles.  While in this episode, a lot of episodes are contained in areas near lush green trees, water or dirt, it's not so much of the background but how the characters are design and how well the battles are portrayed.  And I can easily say that with ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original Uncut"", the fast-paced action in this volume is great for a TV series and good for what one can expect on DVD.

As for the audio, the audio for ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 is pretty much Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 Bilingual (Japanese and English). Similar to a series like ""Dragon Ball Z"", with ""Naruto"", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series. It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.

Especially Maile Flanagan's Naruto Uzumaki. Personally, I didn't think there would be a voice actor that could capture Junko Takeuchi's Naruto vocals and sure enough, Flanagan does a great job. But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.

Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"" comes with the following special features on disc 3:

  Production Art - Using your remote, you can view through ten pages of artwork.
  Omake - (7:01) All the omake ending portions (after the credits) from the episodes featured in DVD Set 13 of ""Naruto Shippuden"".
  Clean Opening
  Clean Ending

JUDGMENT CALL:

Emotional, action-packed and one of the best volumes of ""Naruto Shippuden"" by far!

Let me just say that ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"" features of the greatest arcs and battles to be featured in the long-running ""Naruto"" anime series.

In a way, I really don't want to spoil this volume for anyone, so what I can say is that the Six Path attacks the Hidden Leaf Village, Naruto is trained on how to use Sage Mode but most importantly, if you are a big fan of the series especially with characters such as Kakashi, Chouji, Shikamaru, Shino or even little Konohamaru, this is an arc that you do not want to miss!

But for Naruto Uzumaki, this is the battle between the two disciples of Jiraiya.  While ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 features a ton of emotion and action, it does continue in the next volume which is another must-own!

But we learn a little of how one can stray from different paths.  How can Naruto and Pain be so different from each other and why?  What new abilities will Naruto have if he learns ""Sage Mode"" and what are the dangers in his training?

Kakashi is one of the great ninjas of the Hidden Leaf, but is his skills enough to defeat the most powerful Pain within the Six Paths and for Hinata, who has long loved Naruto and not wanting to see him die, will she ever be able to tell him how she really feels about him?

You'll have to watch ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"" to find out!

As for the DVD set, you get a total of 12 episodes and a the typical special features such as storyboard, production art and the ending omake for each episode.

Overall, ""Naruto Shippuden DVD Set 13 - Original & Uncut"" is another important volume but also one of the more significant volumes to be release by far.  The story for these episodes are so emotional, so exciting and so thrilling that if you are a Naruto fan, you owe yourself to watch these episodes.  They are fantastic!

Emotional, action-packed and one of the best volumes of ""Naruto Shippuden"" by far!  It's a battle for survival as the Six Paths attack the Hidden Leaf Village.  Who will live and who will die?

Naruto is strong and pulls out all the stops in fighting Pain. Episode 166 is the one that Hinata goes into action against Pain for the one she loves, Naruto. 166 is emotional, action packed, and tragic all together. Many of my favorite characters are front and center in the action throughout this set...but for me the greatest part is Hinata fighting to defend Naruto:) The Pain battle is not concluded in this set...but will continue in set 14...so that is something to anticipate.

The story's movement is fluid and they did't spend a whole episode on one move. The downside that would prevent a person from buying this DVD is that the quality is REALLY bad, similar to a bootleg DVD from early 2000. I've tested it on an PS3, Xbox 360, and a PC; the best quality was on the Xbox 360 and the worst was on the PC. The poor quality is the only reason what kept this from being 5 stars.

5346150,4,B009L0NC96,"I've already seen the Naruto Shippuden episodes on this disc in Japanese online a couple of years ago, so I'm not that willing to compare it to other anime series. Although I'm not much of a hardcore Naruto fan as I once was, I still like to collect the new DVD sets to watch in English to see how America can keep up with the updated episodes. The only problem with this product was that Disc 2 in this set was defected on the last two episodes; they kept freezing up and I couldn't go any further.

This wasn't the first time I came across something like this when I bought a newly wrapped package of an anime Dvd series. In a Wolf's Rain Perfect Collection DVD set that was produced by Bandai, Episode 14 froze up as well.

I don't mind the problem that I faced with the Naruto Shippuden set that I bought, but I'm not that eager to replace the disc anytime soon. I'm not sure if the conversion of the disc was produced poorly, but I don't want to see that happen again.",1363132800,,973,4.197860962566845

Amazing things happen here and you truly won't want to miss it. It brought tears to my eyes, and that is no exaggeration.

SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!

This was an incredible box set, but I'm just as furious as Naruto was when they (seemingly) killed what I'm certain is one of the most endearing characters in the whole series. I was almost brought to tears of sadness and rage, which just reminds me why this the best Anime series out there. No other movie, show, or cartoon gets this emotional response from me. And now begins the long await for Box Set 14 in April.",1360454400,3,728,4.306569343065694
5346162,5,B009L0NC96,"13 episodes, each perfect, each builidng on the last.  Naruto is working diligently at Mount Myobuku to become a sage hoping to surpass his master, the late Jiraiya and to be the ""child of prophesy"".

The Akatsuki believe that they have captured the first eight tailed beasts assault the Leaf village to capture the last of the Jinchuriki.  (Naruto is the host for the nine-tailed fox demon).

Naurto Shippuden is a Manga like Marvel Comics in the US.  Marvel is successful because Stan Lee and other writers developed the characters, including the flaws, quirks, and individuality with each book and dive deep into them, making you feel for them.  Naruto does no less, each of the main characters, and the peripheral characters has a back story, a personality, and the light shines on each of them in turn.

What is amazing about Japanese anime, is the faithfulness of the anime to the manga.  Rarely does the anime deviate from the manga when the material is available to them.  Everyone talks about ""filler episodes"" and these are those times that the ""show must go on"" but no Manga storyline is developed yet to work on.  (Full Metal Alchemist pulled this off -why there is two versions of it - Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood faithful to the Manga)

In this set, as Naruto is away, his peers fight the Akatsuki Pain.  Pain is unique in that he manifests himself in six different hosts, with six different powers. The six split up and 3 of them begin a diversion, by destroying the village.  The other 3 hunt for Naruto, questioning and killing villagers who do not help them.  Nobody in the village gives up Naruto a testament to the villages' loyalty.

I am trying not to give up too much detail, so that you watch the episodes, but rest assured, everyone has a moment to shine.  Perhaps Hinata shines the brightest, and hey, YES there was a reason she's on the cover.  I think these episodes and the next set through Episode 175 are the PERFECT series anime -and it could hae ended right there.",1359936000,5,2001,4.655270655270655
5346163,5,B009L0NC96,"It was definitely the best part of the show yet, but it ended on a cliffhanger!!!!!! Hinata just died (i think)  and Naruto entered his 9 tails cloak with pain screaming ""DO YOU HATE ME NOW."" Yes i do hate you now (i still love the show though) why did viz have to end it at that moment there should have been at least one more episode. Now i have to wait till april to find out what happens. i started with the dub and im ending with the dub. im not reading the manga either because i don't like the format. thats all i have to say.",1359763200,5,533,3.935185185185185

5346167,5,B009L0NC96,"Warning: If you haven't seen episodes 130-154, then don't read this review as I will reference past events.

One of the great things about long running series such as Naruto is that it isn't just Naruto's story; Shikamaru, Kakashi , Gaara and Sasuke have all had their chances to shine in recent months. All of these stories have been extremely enjoyable and a welcome addition to the Naruto universe - but what of Naruto's story? We've seen him rescue Gaara, push Orochimaru to breaking point, and continue his promised pursuit of Sasuke. On top off all that, he's had to cope with the pain of losing a loved one. Emotionally and physically, Naruto has gone through a lot; but when the Akatsuki leader Pain comes to Konoha seeking the nine tails jinchuriki it seems Naruto's torment is only just beginning.

We've been treated to some sensational fights recently in Naruto Shippuden, and luckily for us, this boxset contains even more great action; as Naruto makes a stand against the Six Paths Of Pain. This is undoubtedly his moment, and he doesn't let down. It's here that we see how far Naruto has come - from loud mouthed wannabe hokage to protector of the leaf - it's here that the anime comes full circle and the transition is complete. And what a transition is is, as Naruto demonstrates his newly developed sage powers and superior intellect to great effect. Fans who have followed the series since the beginning will feel a real sense of proudness at just how much Naruto has grown.

Of course Naruto isn't alone in his devotion to protecting Konoha, and in these episodes fans get to see favourites in action such as Kakashi, Sakura, Shikamaru, Kiba and Shino, plus a few other surprise members who you wouldn't expect to get involved in the action.

But don't think this set is all action, though. The drama is still as powerful as ever. There are a few occasions when a poignant moment or a tragic scene are accompanied by a equally sad song, resulting in a few teary eyes for most viewers. It truly is a perfect balance. It also helps that Pain is one of the greatest characters to ever appear in Naruto, and all scenes that he is in are utterly absorbing to watch.

A special mention has to go for episode 166 which is probably the best ever episode of Naruto. The animators really went all out on this one, and is an absolute pleasure to watch.

Overall, the story, action, characterization and music in this boxset all come together for a truly unforgettable set of 13 episodes that will be watched over and over again. Brilliant work by Masashi Kishimoto, and easily the best set of episodes yet.

In Short: This set contains 13 episodes, which are episodes 154-166. It's a crucial set in the Naruto universe, one which is packed with just about everything you could want in an excellent series; There are epic fights, great characterization and an awesome soundtrack plus unforgettable moments that you'll watch over and over again. Simply must be viewed.

Other similar anime/manga I recommend: Hunter x Hunter and One Piece.",1356652800,15,3046,4.712406015037594

Also the battle against the last Pain while Naruto is transformed into his nine-tails cloak is wild and one of the best action animation scenes in the history of anime in my opinion. The very last encounters with Pain are not until the next box set, but this set is the main battle. The various jutsu used by Pain in these episodes is awesome. There is also interesting philosophy that makes its way into the anime represented by the question of how one would eliminate war and establish peace in the ninja world, Pain being the proponent of overwhelming force leading to such catastrophic destruction, pain and suffering, that mankind afterwards would establish peace through exhaustion and fear of repeat. Its really an interesting aspect of this anime. I am pitching an ""overwhelming push"" to buy this set, you won't regret it.",1502582400,,950,4.798780487804878
