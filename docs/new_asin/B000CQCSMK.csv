Julie gives great insights into how storytelling works--especially in the horror genre. The basic principles she outlines are not only useful for screenwriting, but for writing anything in the horror genre--such as novel writing. One of the things I appreciate is how she cites film academic works that have real practical applications in genre writing. I took the ideas she talks about in this video to finally get a novel written. Very impressed with this video. My only complaint is that this is her only video. She and Mercurio need to get back to work and make more of these!",1502064000,,695,4.8

8100418,2,B000CQCSMK,"This woman obviously knows what she's talking about, but she is incredibly boring.  She offers insightful looks into the genres, especially horror, and how they blend.  She uses excellent examples to illustrate some of her points.  But she's academic, tends to shotgun her ideas, instead of focusing on the craft of screenwriting, and it must be said, it's sometimes difficult to follow her train of thought.  If you can stay awake through her lecture, you'll learn a thing or two.",1221782400,3,481,4.975
