8311421,5,B001IV61GM,"""Delivery: En Melodious"" is one of those rare movies where you can tell everyone involved with the project gave it their all.  It is this dedication that makes it such a fun movie to watch.  John Myers shows talent in his creativity and I am looking forward to seeing more of him as a writer/director.  Although the cast is made up of non-professional actors, the performances are better than many ""hollywood"" movies because you can tell the people involved really developed meaningful working relationships with each other, which allowed them to get the best out of each other in terms of performance.  Everything about the movie has a do-it-yourself quality to it.  Rather than wasting time dreaming about a life in the movies, the people involved in ""Delivery: En Melodious"" actually did something about it and made their dreams a reality.  That, in itself, deserves our respect and attention.  The movie shows loads of creativity and is so elegant in its simplicity (simplistic in terms of plot, not execution) that it makes you want to see more movies like this being made.  But then again, part of what makes the movie so great is the fact that there has never been another movie like it, nor will there ever be.  Do yourself a favor and order a copy because you won't regret it.  In fact, you'll even feel good about yourself for helping out a creative and aspiring filmmaker in the process.  Highly recommended!",1229126400,,1419,4.774590163934426
