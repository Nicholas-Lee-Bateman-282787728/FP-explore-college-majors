7732912,5,B01E7XTFN8,I love this show so much and I'm looking forward to owning season 8 to complete my collection. Following the recent announcements that neither Stana or Tamala will be in the next season this will be the last season I watch and buy. Castle without the whole cast ( not sure if Jon or Seamus are being asked back ) isn't the show I've invested time in this past 8 years. The 'Nathan Fillion show' aka season 9 I'll be passing on.,1461283200,25,427,4.219512195121951
7732913,5,B01E7XTFN8,"If the rumors are true, I will not watch a season 9 without a Beckett. Supposedly they are doing a total cast redo and did not ask Stana Katic back for season 9. Also Laney (Tamala Jones) is out too and possibly Espo (Jon Huertas) and Kevin (Seamus Dever) might be gone too. Really? I guess season 8 is actually the last real season, not good.",1461283200,17,343,4.212121212121212

7732926,3,B01E7XTFN8,"I didn't miss one episode from the Pilot. However season 8 killed it. I still watched every episode but the magic quickly died. Tolanga was a nice edition, but the guy was awful!! They gave us our ""happy ending"", but in a horribly rushed way. Sad ending for  what was my favorite show of all time.",1521590400,,297,4.303571428571429

7732935,5,B01E7XTFN8,"Wen Castle signed off, I knew I would be having withdrawal symptoms.  Intelligently written and well performed, it had all the elements of a cop drama, family oriented, science fiction kick.  It was gripping and fun. I bought the first season, started watching and, since I just finished the very last episode of S8 last night, I will be beginning to watch Season 1 and enjoy it all again...thanks to cast and crew, this is so much fun!!",1519516800,,437,4.589743589743589

If you're squeamish about murder mysteries this one is not for you, but if you like a little mystery, action and laughter you will love Castle! start with season one. You won't have any idea what's going on if you start in the middle or with season 8.",1518566400,,359,4.373134328358209
7732940,1,B01E7XTFN8,"Got Castle Season 8 as a Christmas present to my mom...she finally had the time to open it and start watching it. MAJOR skipping going on, took it out of the DVD player...big time scratch on the DVD. It was not dropped, nor did it get scratched taking it out of the case, it came that way. Now she can't watch it...big time disappointed. Please do something to fix the issue...thanks.",1518480000,,384,4.422535211267606
7732941,4,B01E7XTFN8,"Once again a great series falls victim to diverging from its proven formula. Don't get me wrong. Even at its worst, this show was still pretty darned good, but this last season just didn't have quite the sparkle of previous seasons, in my opinion, largely because they chose not to have Castle and Becket working together for much of it. Since a huge part of the magic of this show was the chemistry between the two characters, it left a number of the episodes feeling a bit flat. Also, while I'm glad that they got enough notice of the series' cancellation to wrap it up, the way they tacked it on to what was, clearly, meant to be the season cliff hanger, was a bit jarring. Ah well. It was still a great show, and I will definitely miss it.",1518393600,2,743,4.314285714285714

In the final minute of the last episode, Castle and Becket get killed off.

For reasons I can only imagine, someone decided to flash forward 7 years in the last 10 seconds to show a miraculously resurrected Castle and Beckett with three kids as a happy family.

While there were 3 or 4 episodes this season that were really good and entertaining, the season as a whole stunk.

Quit watching Castle with season 7.  Do not reward the producers of this fiasco with your purchase of this boxed set.",1496361600,2,510,4.56043956043956

7733061,4,B01E7XTFN8,"Petty interpersonal politics once again kills off a good program.

We will probably never know the REAL reason Castle was cancelled but they simply cannot have been stupid enough to think that they could go back to a simple, police procedural once Kate and Richard got married.  Their relationship was what kept the watchers - you know - watching.

All the other cop shows, like NCIS, Law & Order and the rest, seem to have found the right formula and MAYBE they made a mistake when they married the two leads, thus preventing them from continuing the tension between them.

What would have happened if Kate left the show?  The magic in this show was Castle's interaction with Kate.

That was it.  That was the basis of the show. If would have been better if they'd simply not gotten married but remained friends (even in a strained relationship) and continued to work together as a team, or even have Castle work with the other guys off and on.

Even the end sucked as they lay there dying and reaching out to each other, and then the video-over comes on to tell us that they survived and continued on with their dreams.",1483920000,,1121,4.54228855721393

As others have noted the most serious problem is the writing -- the plots are often so ridiculous that it is hard for the actors to do other than go through the motions.

7733098,1,B01E7XTFN8,"There is no greater fan of Castle than I am! I own all 7 previous seasons of Castle. I loved the ""tearful tenderness"" that existed between Castle and Beckett and between Castle and Alexis! I believe that ABC decided at the end of season 7 that season 8 would be the last one. However, to do that, they had to fire the creator, Andrew Marlowe, and the other show runners and hire new ones. They found it necessary to make the show less desirable by destroying the chemistry between Castle and Beckett and produce scripts that ran contrary to Andrew Marlowe's dream and intent for the show. To have Beckett battle Loksat without Castle and a swat team made no sense whatsoever and the fans hated it! Therefore, viewership declined, along with the ratings. Lower ratings gave ABC the reason to cancel the show. THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS ACHIEVED! (i would recommend season 8 only to diehard fans of Castle! I bought it only because my collection would not be complete without it. I watch it now and hold my nose while I do!)",1479168000,,1015,4.551912568306011

Talk about changing the story to fit a plot point"") evolved into a horrifc and insulting eigth season. It was abundantly clear there was something going on between Fillion and Katic long before Katic was fired and Fillion was accused of treating her terribly on set, forcing her to break down on a daily basis. With the exception of two or three episodes, this season was the worst of Castle. Changing show runners in season 8 and immediately breaking up their marraige made no sense to the viewers. Having Castle follow her around trying to win her back was simply painful. For a show that gpt so much right over the years, season 8 was an insult those of us who were loyal fans. It is now painful to watch reruns knowing how much they hated each other. If you're a fan who hasn't seen season 8, if you get the chance, watch episodes 12, 15 & 18.

7733183,2,B01E7XTFN8,"I have been a fan of Castle since season one, episode one, day one.  The mix of banter, romance, and mystery was perfect for me.  Okay, so the mysteries weren't the strongest, but I fell in love with these characters and couldn't wait to revisit them week after week.

Which is why I am still trying to wrap my head around what the writers did to them in season 8.

Yes, I was actually one of the many who was glad the show was canceled when this season ended so we were all put out of our misery.  There were parts I enjoyed, but for the most part it felt very forced this season.

And Ill warn you now that this review might devolve into rants a few times.

The season opens with a brilliant two part episode that finds mystery writer Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) investigating the disappearance of his wife, newly promoted NYPD Captain Kate Beckett (Stana Kantic), with the help of two of her detectives, Kevin Ryan and Javier Esposito (Seamus Dever and Jon Huertas).  Then, in the second part, we get Becketts side of things until both halves come together for a wonderful climax.  Well, it would have been wonderful if they hadnt decided to completely mess with the show.

See, the plot of this two parter revolved around Beckett learning there was more to the conspiracy surrounding her mothers murder, something I thought we had finally put to bed a couple of seasons ago.  Beckett learns that she is in danger, and in an attempt to keep Castle and his mother and daughter, Martha and Alexis (Susan Sullivan and Molly Quinn) safe, she announces she needs a break for their marriage and moves out.  No explanation to Castle about what is really going on.  Nothing.

Now, this is supposed to recapture the old magic of the show when Castle was pursuing Beckett and she was resisting.  And they returned to Castle working as a PI to bring him into these cases of the week.  But seriously, lets go back to that premise for a minute.  What bad guy is going to stop going after your family because you left them a week ago?  A month ago?  Seriously?  You think thats going to keep them safe?  They are going to go after them to get at you just as much today as they did before you left.  Plus, with no warning to them, they are in more danger.  If you stayed or at least told them why you left, theyd be more on their guard, so better protected, than if you just walk out of their lives.

Not to mention that this show is as much romantic comedy as it is mystery show.  After watching the will they/wont they tension and the building of their relationship leading up to their marriage last season, I don't want to see things go backwards.  I actually liked the show after it got Castle and Beckett together because it showed growth for their characters and built a solid relationship between them.  This was a huge step backwards.

And frankly, this overshadowed the case of the week aspect of the series.  While might have had a bit more overarching storyline this year, there were still plenty of cases of the week, but the spark wasn't there because I was so frustrated by the breakup.  Still, over the course of the season, we get mysteries such as the death of Castles writing idol, a murder aboard a cruise ship that has just set sail, and a corpse that the theater where Marthas latest show is rehearsing.  Many of these individual episodes are good and have great moments, but overall they cant rise about the premise of the season.

Of course, with Beckett as a captain now, Castle shares more detecting scenes with Ryan and Esposito, and that chemistry isn't the same, which doesnt nothing to help the show.  Mind you, I love the characters, but they aren't Castle and Beckett together.

Fortunately, the complete breakup didn't last all season as Beckett did finally clue Castle in to what was happening, leading to a repeat of season 5 where the two where sneaking around.  Are you sensing a theme here?  Reruns.  No new ground, nothing but reruns.  The writers did try to tie in Castles missing memory from last season to the mystery this season, but it just felt forced.

And speaking of forced, this seasons big bad is also very forced.  The payoff for all the angst was so underwhelming it left me scratching my head as to why anyone thought it would be a good idea.

Now Im not pointing my finger at any of the actors.  They all did a great job with what they were given, and when they had a moment to shine, they took full advantage of it.  Praise also much go to new actors Toks Olagundoye and Sunkrish Bala who had the thankless job of stepping into roles in a season that the fans didn't like.  I have nothing against them, but the changes they represent to the show on the other hand.

Late in the season, word came down that Tamala Jones, the actress who plays medical examiner Lanie Parish, as well as Stana Katic were not going to be back for next season.  While some started cries of sexism (and that might be the case, I don't know), I spent all of my time trying to wrap my head around doing this show without Beckett.  Oh, I know the show is called Castle.  But reference my earlier comments about this being a romantic comedy.  If budget constraints were the reason (and thats the reason ABC gave), then you fire the rest of the cast and retool the show to just be about Castle and Beckett.

Fortunately, ABC came to the right decision and canceled the show at the last possible moment, giving us a chance to see the ending that wrapped things up instead of the cliffhanger.  (Two different endings for the season were shot.)  However, that ending felt so tacked on and forced that it left me feeling cold.  You want a good ending for this series?  Look back at the season finale for season 7.  That was a great ending to the show, and thats where I intend to stop with Castle.  This last season?  It was a fevered dream I had about fan fiction featuring the characters and nothing more.

For the record, if you are looking for this set, youll find 22 episodes here in widescreen and full surround sound.  In the way of extras, youll find a couple of audio commentaries, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a featurette showing the cast of the show trying to solve puzzles to get out of an escape room.

If you are a fan of Castle, do yourself a favor and skip season 8.  It is a mess that ruins the characters and the legacy of the show.  Even this completest collector plans to skip this season with a clear conscious, which tells you just had bad it truly was.",1472428800,21,6493,4.414141414141414
7733184,3,B01E7XTFN8,"I have been a die-hard Castle fan since the first episode. It is easily my favorite show of all time. I have to say though that Season 8 was abysmal. I bought the DVD for episode 1 and 2, Fidelis Ad Mortem and Crossfire. I doubt I will ever rewatch the rest.  They were repetitive (the victim is dead, no he's alive! Done in prior season) and lacked the chemistry and magic of prior seasons.  I found myself reading, surfing the net etc while the shows were on live TV. In previous seasons it was 'lock the door and turn off the phone, Castle is on!'  I also bought this for the extras (bloopers etc) but they were actually tough to watch knowing how everything ended.

7733186,3,B01E7XTFN8,"+++Warning, this will have some spoilers from the prior seasons, but not major season 8 giveaways++++

What ends up being the final season of Castle is kind of choppy and uneven.  As most know there were a lot of rumors about real life bad blood between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic, to the point they could not stand to be around each other.  It definitely looks like there were many scenes put in to keep them separated a lot this season.  While I do think they were both professional and if the rumors were true managed to fake their chemistry pretty well, it definitely felt like their characters did not interact as much, which cost the show much of the flow and feel it had the prior 7 years.

This season does tie up a lot of things, including the Senator Bracken story line, in which Jack Coleman makes a couple appearances in prison after having been arrested last season.  It also reveals what happened during Castle's missing time from the prior season, and works into what is ultimately the big bad story that carries throughout the season.  The reveal may or may not be satisfying to some, but I personally found it a bit underwhelming.  That said there were some very good moments throughout the season, including an Esposito centric episode that was one of the best of the season.  You can tell the original ending was meant to be a cliffhanger that would provide a way for Stana Katic to exit the show when the original plan was to let her go and continue the series on without her, which ABC wised up and realized would never work.  That made the ending we see in the series, while touching, somewhat rushed.  And we really do not get a series sendoff for all the characters which should have, and probably would have been done if not for the last minute cancellation.  The cast went through more shake ups with Penny Johnson Gerald out as the captain.  Her character was essentially replaced by Toks Olagundoye as Hayley Shipton a PI that ends up helping Castle and Sunkrish Bala as Vikram Singh who is a member of the AG's office who helps Beckett in the hunt for the season's big bad.  There are also appearances by a few Firefly cast mates of Fillion with Adam Baldwin returning as Detective Slaughter, Summer Glau, playing another PI, and Jewel Staite in a guest role.

For those who get the discs, for extras there are a few deleted scenes, commentary tracks on two episodes, a gag reel, and a 10 min cast mystery where members of the cast have to solve a series of clues together to escape a room.  Okay for what is there, but not great.  All in all, it was an okay final season, but I think could have been better if the writers and producers knew going in that it would be the final season and had a chance to do a proper send off.",1472342400,14,2759,4.431683168316832

7733192,2,B01E7XTFN8,"If you haven't seen season 8 yet, don't. Instead, consider season 7 the last season. The writers left at the end of 7. Given the various media info, it was because of Nathan Fillion's behavior. If you don't buy into all of that, review the opening credits in episodes from seasons 1-7, and compare them to 8. When I first saw the credits for season 8, I thought... ""who are these people?"" As for the actors, the writers say a lot of nice things about Stana Katic; as for him....
I looked at the 5 star ratings on this site - they were either 5 stars for Castle as a whole - seasons 1-7 - or they hadn't actually seen season 8 yet - or they might be fake reviews. I agree fully with 5 stars for seasons 1-7.
I also reviewed online comments for season 8 at other sites. It really says something that Castle was popular at the end of season 7, but by the middle of season 8, fans were already begging for the show to be canceled, so that the horror could stop.
Season 8 started ok, but immediately you could tell the writing had changed. I couldn't hear Terri's 'voice', and then I realized I couldn't hear Andrew's 'voice' as well - that's when I went online and I found out they had left the show.
If there were good episodes in season 8, and there were...the bad overshadowed the good. The episode that sticks out as best in my mind is the Titanic one. I remember seeing Nathan Fillion dancing on stage and thinking he looked like a beached whale twerking. As for a bad episode, if you get season 8, don't watch ""Tone Death"". Don't. Watch. It. But if you must, try not to do so before going to sleep. It's so bad it will give you nightmares.
I'm not a Nathan Fillion fan from Firefly (didn't see it until recently - it's 15 years old), but I am a fan from watching him on Castle. I've been impressed with his work, but you don't really see that in season 8. I sometimes watched him on screen in season 8 and was confused that he didn't even bother to try to do a decent job. It also seemed at times that the role was physically too difficult for him.
As for the finale, I had always wanted a happy ending for these two characters, and you get that, but it just seemed wrong. Season 8 was so awful I was shocked at how disappointed I was that Castle didn't die. The REAL Castle (not Fillion), and Kate Beckett deserved a better ending.

7733198,5,B01E7XTFN8,"it is a shame that, or it seems to me, that the really great shows seem to want to end in a dismal setting i watch the shows for the entertainment and the hope that these shows give us. there could be rainbows at the end, does not matter if true in life or not. if i want real life all i have to do is wake up. the really great shows give us characters that we can love as they do for each other. is it necessary to take that away from the viewer just to give a shock or go for ""real"" life according to the values of whoever is handling the show at the time. life is hard and any escape which does not involve drugs or any of that garbage and lets me feel good for just a little while is pure gold to me. i am sad to see what they have done to Castle, and other shows like that. with everything going on in the world as it is, it would not hurt to have a little hope and enjoyment for people to look forward to at the end of the day. i know i am just one person and don't have a big voice but i sure would enjoy a series that put the viewer first and the corp second. is it necessary to kill off the only thing that means a little something for a little escape from life as we all know it to be. i know i sound overly dramatic, but for a lot of us that is really important. that is how i feel and you can think of this whatever you want, it is how i feel-so have a great day and hopefully we will get something that puts smiles on our faces rather than giving us more to rue, and turn off.",1468454400,17,1489,3.7301587301587302

7733200,2,B01E7XTFN8,"S8 of Castle was a sad disaster.
Acting and crew were spot on as always but the overall plotting of the season was abysmal, with main characters making bad decisions out of nowhere so that there would be an excuse to get rid of them (Kate Beckett) later on.

There were also new characters that could have been interesting if they had not been put there as diversionary tactics for an uneven season. Keeping well known characters on the show could have been interesting as well.

Some late season episodes are more reminiscent of the Castle of old and enjoyable in general but the last minutes of the last episode ruin any ounce of fun a fan could have gotten from this season.

If you loved Castle S1-7 and for some reason have escaped S8, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.

A year after the beginning of S8 and I still can't see how the showrunnes decided that Beckett leaving Castle for any period of time under that sad excuse was a good idea.",1465430400,65,953,4.3977272727272725
7733201,5,B01E7XTFN8,I like Castle. It was one of my favorite shows. But it is good the show was cancel. The show would not of been the same without Kate on the show. The show was about Kate and Castle. The show had a happy ending. I am happy about that.,1465171200,14,233,3.7755102040816326
7733202,4,B01E7XTFN8,"I have enjoyed all 8 seasons of ""Castle"", however the ending of season 8 was a disappointment. I refer to the part where they were ambushed in their kitchen. The show would have been better if they had a good night and then we saw a glimpse of their future together. That said I will give season 9 a chance, because I have always loved the comedy of Nathan Fillon (he makes me smile if not laugh out loud). It would be interesting to see how the story develops without Beckett and the other casts. I hope if anything Beckett and the boys make cameo appearances.  I guess the story will feature more on his detective agency.",1464652800,13,623,4.3247863247863245

7733205,2,B01E7XTFN8,"I have enjoyed Castle for 7 seasons (I have all 7 on DVD bought from Amazon), but when Season #8 began it was as if someone had kidnapped the writers  or they were holding out for better offers of money!  The ""Show-runner"" position had changed as well and along with it the continuity and overall excellence of the series.  Then there was the late announcement that Kate Beckett had gotten (as it were) a better offer to do other things than crawl through the dismal writing of the current season.  Along with her went the venerable Medical Examiner (Tamala Jones), with ABC stating rather poorly ""budget constraints.""  WHAT?  All the male leads were in place, but gone was Capt. Gates (female) as well, and if ever there was a case for gender bias it was right there in front of us.  If you really want to screw things up, then just let a ""network"" run things.  The other reviewers of this series have it right: What was once the most popular ""dramedy"" on TV had sunk into the depths of below average writing and a lack of the ""sparkle"" that had existed before the negotiations with Stana Katic.  Frankly, some of the plot lines were getting blurred, and trying to glue this mess together seemed to just make it worse.  One thing I have learned from seeing successful shows stick around: people want closure!  These 8 or 10-part series within a series do not work as well as maybe a 2 or 3-parter.  Otherwise you might just as well make a movie and scratch the whole TV thing!  I am writing this on the late afternoon of the 16th of May, and it is also the end of Castle as an on-going series.  That is it.  Done, Kaput, Over With, See-Ya!  This does not mean that I will not complete the collection of shows by eventually buying Season 8, but it would be with a heavy heart and some thoughts of what might have been.  Thank You Andrew W. Marlowe for creating a terrific comedy/drama that makes even us males of the species stop thinking about Monday Night Football~!  I wish all the fabulous cast members the best in their coming endeavors!",1463356800,176,2042,4.443548387096774

7733207,1,B01E7XTFN8,"Season 8 has strayed from the formula that made Castle a success & a pleasure for its previous seasons.
We watched as knowing Kate changed Castle & knowing Castle changed Kate---they became more balanced and emotionally healthy human beings due to their relationship. Whatever Season 9 is, without the core premise of the author and his muse, it won't be the Castle that fans knew & loved & were faithful to for 8 seasons.",1462924800,9,422,4.716216216216216

Best wishes to everybody involved with the show, I believe you guys could have kept going to that magic ten season benchmark. I do believe you have the best writers, actors and crew to have pulled it off. It still may work by following Castle and his book characters in their adventures.

And no, it didn't happen in the mail, because it was one of several items delivered in one box.  The box was not dented or smashed in any way, and all the other items in that order where just fine.  So Amazon sold me a BROKEN brand new item.  So glad I pay the ever-increasing price of Prime so I could receive it in 2 days.  Anyway, I checked the disks and thankfully none of them look scratched, and it's just too annoying to do a return and reorder so... I'm keeping it.
