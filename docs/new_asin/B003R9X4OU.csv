8403391,5,B003R9X4OU,Certainly a great series of DVD.  Lots of practical techniques and procedures to efficiently save money over the course of a project.  Really helped me develop confidence in myself and my skills.  Even better than the DVD itself is the connection one gains to an extremely qualified and helpful expert.,1386201600,,302,5.0
8403392,5,B003R9X4OU,"Excellent series of videos. As a first time aeroplane builder I have bought all the videos in this series. I have found them extremely
informative and have have picked up many good tips from them.",1386028800,2,196,4.628571428571429
8403393,5,B003R9X4OU,"I am a  FAA aircraft mechanic and inspector (A&P/IA). I have been to Blue Swallow Aircraft's workshop. I have viewed and inspected very closely many examples of their restoration work.  The quality and accuracy of their work is outstanding. There are many people masquerading as so called ""experts"" in vintage aircraft restoration.  John Gaertner the owner of Blue Swallow aircraft LLC is not one of those! John's workmanship, attention to detail and historical accuracy is second to none.
This and the other Blue Swallow Aircraft instructional DVDs are professionally produced highly informative training programs. They are designed for people who want learn how to restore vintage aircraft correctly whist also maintaining the historical accuracy of their projects. These are excellent DVDs produced by one of the world's masters in vintage aircraft restoration.",1386028800,2,864,5.53030303030303
8403394,5,B003R9X4OU,"It's hard to get this info, and kudos for making it available. I've seen their work first hand, and their standard is ""perfect"". This is great for someone launching off to build an aircraft.",1386028800,,190,4.617647058823529
8403395,5,B003R9X4OU,"This DVD is like gold dust to anyone interested in building and restoring old airplanes, especially those of the pioneering era / WW1 and Golden Age of Aviation.  I am working on a plans built Sopwith Pup project and found lots of useful information including tools, setup and techniques.  Seeing it on video is MUCH more helpful than trying to interpret books and old manuals.",1385942400,,377,4.7846153846153845
8403396,5,B003R9X4OU,"I found this DVD to be extremely informative and helpful and the tips that it provided have allowed me jump start a stalled restoration project.  The insight into proper steaming and bending of wood was invaluable to me and was the primary reason for obtaining the DVD but the other information has been equally insightful and even things that I knew how to do I now have alternative and better ways to approach.  As an amateur/weekend builder I would recommend this to anyone ready to jump into the wooden aircraft restoration or building hobby, the time it will save you in research and mistakes will pay for it many times over.",1385942400,,630,4.666666666666667
8403397,5,B003R9X4OU,"I liked this DVD.  It started with the basics of aircraft woodworking and went forward from there. If you never built a wooden airplane before, you will learn a lot.  Some things I knew but I also picked up many tips.  I particularly liked the part where the guy in the video showed how to use a small hand planer to taper the top of a spar.  I also liked how he used empty squeeze bottles to spread the glue over a lamination. Overall, I would recommend this video.",1385856000,,466,4.202247191011236
8403398,1,B003R9X4OU,This video was not worth the money I paid.  Most of the time was spent on things like tool handling and safety and very little on actually doing woodworking.  So many things were left out I can only assume that the author doesn't want any competition or loss of business by people doing their own work!,1380067200,,302,4.375
8403399,2,B003R9X4OU,"The quality of sound was not good.  At times it was inaudible.
Not much info that I did not already know unless you have never been a wood worker.",1340755200,,146,4.0344827586206895
8403400,5,B003R9X4OU,Here's useful instruction and information about a series of skills that come into play when involved-- at almost all levels-- in work on antique airplanes.  Valuable for anyone located anywhere.  Highly recommended.,1276300800,,215,5.6875
