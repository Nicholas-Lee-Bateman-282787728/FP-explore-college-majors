4599236,5,B0058KAISG,"I ordered this for my husband as a last minute Christmas add-on present after I saw him watching Alone in the Wilderness I and II on NPT. He was lamenting that he didn't have them on DVD so he could watch them whenever he wanted. Well, I ran to Amazon and ordered the whole package because I don't think he even knows there is a book AND more DVDs! The shipping was so inexpensive and the package arrived two whole days before the expected delivery date! He is going to be so pumped!! This series is so wonderful. I've watched it a few times as well, and Dick Proenneke's documentation of his experiences leaves me educated, entertained and somehow brings my blood pressure down:) Love it.",1356220800,2,689,4.476190476190476
4599237,5,B0058KAISG,"I sent them to my father after watching, an now am lending to my sister.  Lovely photography and imagery.  There was a small bit of repeated footage, and I wonder how many miles of unused footage still are waiting to be made public.  All in all I am quite happy with the DVDs and I am glad that the $$ went straight to a family that seems for all intents and purposes to be good small-scale, dedicated independent filmmakers.",1355270400,2,425,4.3544303797468356
4599238,5,B0058KAISG,"After watching one of these on PBS, I said ""I have to get me the set!!"".  But, after pledging once already this year, I was hoping I could find this somewhere and Amazon was that place.  This series captivates me!!  Thants!!",1332892800,,224,4.414634146341464
4599239,5,B0058KAISG,"This set of movies and book are such a down to earth set.  This man left life as the normal person knows it, to live in the wilds of Alaska.  He filmed his existence is such a way; that it makes his life fascinating.",1327536000,12,216,3.8863636363636362
4599240,5,B0058KAISG,This gave a glimpse into what it must be like to try and live in the wild alone. It captured the changing seasons in Alaska beautifully. If you like winter and/or the outdoors I highly recommend this.,1325030400,2,200,4.4324324324324325
4599241,5,B0058KAISG,"Grew up watching these shows on PBS as a child.  Even more of an impressive feat now that I am older and realize the stresses as an adult.  The original video was great and brought back good memories. The rest of the package was just fluff.  It seems that the original editor took the best material in the original and what was left was less than stellar.  However, well worth it for the memories.  The package arrived quickly also.",1441756800,3,432,4.417721518987341

4599244,4,B0058KAISG,I've seen parts of these videos for years. Dick Proenneke's skills and patience are amazing. While this series lacks the drama created by the current crop of reality nonsense it's interesting none the less.,1428710400,,206,5.088235294117647

4599248,3,B0058KAISG,"First two DVD's are great, the last two pretty much a repeat of the first two, with a lot of the same footage. I would suggest just the Alone in the Wilderness #1 and #2  Book is also great.",1423958400,11,190,3.871794871794872

4599263,5,B0058KAISG,Just reading Dick's journals and watching him build his cabin is so meditative.  It leaves me relaxed and inspired.  I'm already searching for that little piece of land in the woods.  But I'll have to go pre-fab with the cabin.  I can accept the fact that my wilderness skill level is no match for Dick.,1370390400,3,303,4.454545454545454
4599264,5,B0058KAISG,The videos were very good and showed how one man could survive the rigors of the wilderness.  Our family thoroughly enjoyed these videos and so have our friends.  I would recommend this series.,1368316800,,193,4.818181818181818
4599265,5,B0058KAISG,"I have watched Alone in the Wilderness on our local Public Broadcast Channel in the past, but missed out on purchasing this package.  Couldn't wait to get it in the mail, and it arrived more quickly than anything I have ever ordered.  These CD's are absolutely awesome.  I will never have the opportunity to experience what Mr Proenneke has gone through, but I felt I was right there with him.  Will be watching it over and over again.",1365552000,4,435,4.538461538461538

4599269,5,B0058KAISG,"At the age of 50, Dick Proenneke set out to live what most men can only dream of, to experience a solitary life in the wilds of Alaska. The dvd's and companion book document the undertaking of one man's desire to build a life for himself out of the wild, while also illuminating the true appreciation one can have for the world around them. Both intriguing and entertaining, the Alone in the Wilderness series has an enchanting way of transporting the viewer into a simpler time, fulfilling a primal sense of adventure. These DVDs are great for watching with the family, on a rainy day, or when you just need to relax after a hard day. Filmed starting in 1967, the videos have a unique look and feel that can not be found today, but maintain an excellent quality, which anyone can appreciate.",1359158400,,792,4.545454545454546
4599270,5,B0058KAISG,I loved the Original when I saw it on PBS. I forgot about it until I saw a run again on PBS. Which probably is a good thing because I would not have known to going back and check to see if there were more on the series. I think it's very well done considering the transfer from 16mm film. I really enjoy the series and have watched a couple times already.,1356393600,,355,3.9444444444444446

I have read the book several times over, and watch the videos over and over and over.  If it wasn't so much, or if I were wealthy, I'd buy this package for all my friends too, I am just amazed at this Great Man and what he did and accomplished in his life.",1492905600,,439,4.27710843373494

8461657,5,B0058KAISG,"I received this for Christmas yesterday. I remember watching it on PBS as a kid, but I wasn't interested in paying that much for four 1 hour DVDs and a paper back book. These disks and the book are sooooo much better that anything else available. It's like a time capsule of a wilderness that was so pure. Worth every penny!
