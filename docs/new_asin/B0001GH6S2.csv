8012174,4,B0001GH6S2,"This 6 DVD set is very good & has beautiful visuals, music & voice over by the host who guides us thru each of the destinations. watching these dvd's can be very relaxing & each of the 74 ports look amazing. although there is a brief visit to each, the human element is somehow missing.
also the attractions/ activities at most of these destinations are similar.(maybe beacause they all are connected to the sea?!)Wish they could have made us meet the locals, taken us inside some of the resorts, restaurants or covered the night life, but I guess somethings are left for us to discover.",1244505600,,587,4.6
8012175,5,B0001GH6S2,"I've taken a few cruises now and it's difficult to choose what shore excursions are really what you want.  This video is excellent.  It goes through each port in detail, showing all the main attrations and some of the more unique sights.  I found it very helpful in choosing which cruise to go on and what to see at each port.",1171152000,7,326,4.311475409836065
