5528389,5,B00AYHKJOG,"This was an outstanding movie for the whole family!!!  However, the quality from Amazon was poor as far as sound and stopping  on and off.  The cast is excellent and delivers a great message about how anyone can make a difference.  I loved the little red head boy---so cute and a fabulous actor.

5528409,1,B00AYHKJOG,"Disappointed they ruined this great story with a foul mouth teen age daughter repeatedly swearing at her mother.  I get that teenagers can get disrespectful and sassy at times, but this was taken way too far. Not something I want my children to see or would want to sell to anyone else so I threw the movie in the trash.",1428364800,8,320,4.333333333333333

5528417,4,B00AYHKJOG,"This movie was nice. The storyline is enjoyable for kids ages 8 plus and adults. The poverty theme is very real here, and may be difficult for the youngest kids to grasp. Although we enjoyed watching this movie as a family, I don't see us ever watching it again. It reminds me very much of a movie we would have watched as a child on a major network channel twenty years ago.",1419638400,,375,4.222222222222222

5528422,5,B00AYHKJOG,"This is a great movie for families with middle and high school children.  It is rated PG, and I'm not sure how interesting it would be to younger children. Perhaps with parent interaction and explanation it could hold elementary children's attention. It follows two single parent families--both mothers are widows--and the struggles of raising children alone.  One mother encourages and supports her son's caring heart, which places her in conflict with the older daughter's wants and feelings. The other mother with one young son loses her job and becomes homeless bringing insight into the nightmarish struggles homeless families face.  We were challenged and deeply touched by this movie especially since it is based on a true story.  I think it offers much for family discussion in terms of compassion, initiative, responsibility, selfishness, favoritism, self perception, coping, and more.",1412812800,2,894,5.456521739130435

5528429,4,B00AYHKJOG,"I like an inspirational overcome-the-odds story as well as the next guy. And you can't help but cheer for Zach Bonner and be inspired by a young boy who did something big about an issue he cared about. Zach's caring and compassion and his determination comes across clearly in this movie.

The bad news comes in the form of his sister Kelley. She swears a lot and has a rotten attitude throughout most of the movie. As I understand it, that's not even an accurate portrayal of the real Kelley Bonner. There's already a lot of deep material here for a family to discuss-like homelessness, compassion, determination, etc.-to have to add trying to mitigate the effects of one character's profanity and actions. Thumbs down on the screenwriter.

The real Zach Bonner and the Bonner family are an inspiration. Take my advice and watch the bonus features featuring the real Zach and his family first. Then follow up the movie with a Google search and a visit to lrwf.org ---the Little Red Wagon Foundation's website. Zach Bonner did a whole lot more than just walk across Florida.",1393804800,5,1074,4.768817204301075

5528431,5,B00AYHKJOG,"I thought this was a great movie with an amazing message. I know the family and have since they first started. I was glad to see that they kept the storyline very real. Zach has continued his good work nationwide. I encourage you to watch the movie and then look him up on twitter Zach_Bonner or on facebook Zachary Bonner.

5528432,3,B00AYHKJOG,"Of all of the movies that I've been pointed to by amazon.com because I liked other movies (like Fireproof, Facing the Giants, etc.) this movie has been the best.  It was interesting enough to get to the end, and I really felt motivated by it to good works.  I didn't feel like I could show it to my kids, though, because of the extremely immodest dress of Zack's teenage sister, and the really shocking fights that happen between her and her mother. It's definitely worth seeing, but if you're a Christian, I'd hesitate to show it to your kids.",1390348800,28,544,4.484848484848484

5528436,5,B00AYHKJOG,I thought this movie a good sit down movie for the family. The little boy was so inspiring that was so willing to help displaced hurricane victims and homeless children it just mind blowing. The boy was not even 10 years old and he has already establish his own non prfit organization.

5528440,5,B00AYHKJOG,"This is a great film that everyone should watch.  I'm not just saying this because I was an actor in it, but because it has a great storyline behind it.  It's a true story about a boy who sees a devastating disaster on the news and decides to do something to help the children who are victims of the disaster.  It was filmed in the south of South Carolina, but the story takes place in Florida where the real Zack Bonner lives.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I enjoyed being a part of it.",1378166400,,495,4.020408163265306

But eventually expands his charity to homeless children across America. Setting up a Foundation, getting donations and distributing them; and then walking across country to bring out awareness.

5528449,3,B00AYHKJOG,"If you are like me, there is nothing better than an inspiring, feel good movie. I looked forward to this movie coming out because it seemed like a great story-line that would touch anyone's heart, however, after watching it, I didn't get that feel good feeling. It was an average movie at best and nothing special. It seemed like it was cheaply done and poorly written overall. I was expecting so much more from it after watching the trailer. Don't get me wrong. It is not a terrible move. It is alright to watch during a boring afternoon with the family and could be used to talk to children about giving back and not being selfish. If this was directed by the same person who did RUDY he must have forgotten a few things since doing that great movie.",1359158400,,752,4.41726618705036
