8479654,5,B005MR2O1Y,"Good information, but I wanted more.  I'll have to find another book.",1442707200,,69,4.75
8479655,2,B005MR2O1Y,Very professionally done.  Good quality shots.  It was done for public television.  This is not a home movie.  It's all about the trail and reminded me of the National Geographic video.,1365379200,,185,4.870967741935484
8479656,3,B005MR2O1Y,Just your basic 30 minute PBS special on the Appalachian Trail. Their are much better videos on the trail than this.,1355961600,6,116,4.571428571428571
8479657,1,B005MR2O1Y,"This is just about the history of the trail and has no footage of people hkiing the trail.  As hiker porn, this is a waste of time.",1354492800,5,131,3.8518518518518516
8479658,5,B005MR2O1Y,"This is a must see DVD for anyone interested in the AT. It shows the history and the creation, including actual video and pictures of Benton Mackaye, the original dreamers and planners. If you want to see some footage you may never see anywhere else, I would recommend buying and watching this.",1339113600,,294,4.673076923076923
8479659,4,B005MR2O1Y,I watched this video and learned so much that I didn't know about the history of the trail.  And the story of the blind hiker who made the trek was truly inspiring.  I think whether you live anywhere from Georgia to Maine (or really anywhere else) this DVD is a great addition to your library and a good educational video for kids.,1336262400,,331,4.32258064516129
8479660,1,B005MR2O1Y,"If you're looking for a real tour of the trail itself, this DVD is not it.  This is only a discussion of the founders of the trail.  And too, audio was terrible.  Couldn't understand the muffled and garbled conversations.  I tossed it in the recycle bin this morning.",1328486400,7,267,4.5
