8461497,5,B0058EZHYC,"Being a UK Blu-ray, the concert is in 1080/50i which means that many US PS3s and TVs can't handle the reduced frame rate 50hz instead of 60hz. As for the extras not working, it's possible that those are in standard resolution and therefore in the PAL format.",1339718400,3,258,4.51063829787234
8461498,5,B0058EZHYC,"When i first received this blu-ray in the mail, i was afraid to watch it after reading some of the poor reviews about the cameras.  I have now watched the main show 4 times and the camera work is AWESOME.  It does switch a lot but that is so you can see everything that is going on.  It adds to the enjoyment...As far as one guy saying that the cameras are on the bass player during guitar solos, i'm afraid this guy needs glasses or he doesn't know what a guitar looks like....LOL... Everytime John Norum takes off on one of his patented guitar shredding solos, the camera is right there on John, sometimes right up close on the guitar and sometimes backed off where you can see him and his guitar...The bonus show at the Stockholm ice rink is another full concert with 13 songs..Many of the songs are different from the Shepherd's Bush show...The fairgrounds show is only 3 songs and a guitar solo, but hey, what more can you ask for...Well, there is more..There is a behind the scenes feature and 2 bonus music videos...This blu-ray is well worth the usual 30-35 dollars that you have to pay for a new blu-ray, but i ordered my Blu-Ray from a company called Deep discount_dvd_cd, and it was 6.99....Not a misprint, 6 dollars and 99 cents for a BRAND NEW NEVER OPENED BLU-RAY WITH 2 FULL CONCERTS AND ALL THE OTHER EXTRAS... Oh yeah, the Sound Mix is off the charts also...The louder i turned it, the better it sounded, no distortion at loud levels...In my opinion if you like Europe even a little bit, grab this blu-ray as soon as you can...IT IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!!!!!",1336953600,4,1599,4.487972508591065

If you have a PS3 as a blue ray player DON'T BUY IT!!!",1336694400,2,217,3.617021276595745
8461500,5,B0058EZHYC,The Best Show of the Best Band of Hard Rock of the World! I saw them in Brazil (So Paulo) and now I have the opportunity to watch this show again!,1317427200,2,146,3.7419354838709675
