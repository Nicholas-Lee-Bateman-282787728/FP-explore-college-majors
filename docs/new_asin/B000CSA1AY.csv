8101690,3,B000CSA1AY,"Sodom and Gomorrah is much better than its reputation implies. Although often co-credited to Sergio Leone for tax reasons, it's a Robert Aldrich picture all the way, although Aldrich's style isn't always compatible with the expectations of the epic genre - he's not interested in the sets and some of the most impressive visual compositions are cut very, very short in the editing. Nor is it as decadent or violent as you might expect from the director who would go on to make The Killing of Sister George and The Dirty Dozen. But it is entertaining, with Aldrich managing to get away with more sadism than De Mille ever did, and throwing in a splendid pair of villains in Stanley Baker's perverted prince and Anouk Aimee's lesbian Queen, who easily steal the show from Stewart Granger and the Children of Israel. The supporting cast isn't always as distinguished as the voice cast who redub them (Andrew Keir and Mane Maitland among those in the dubbing theatre), and it's strange to see Granger heading the cast when his tenure at MGM was marked by his refusal to make almost any epic they offered him (Quo Vadis among them), but its still head and shoulders above the standard Italian peplum of the day. Throw in a real doozey of a prolonged battle scene and the last of Miklos Rozsa's Biblical epic scores and you've got a film that may not be fit for Sunday School but which makes for an entertaining two-and-a-half hours. And yes, it really does have a line at the beginning about watching out for Sodomites!

Sadly Castle Hill's German DVD is a wildly inconsistent transfer. Although widescreen (1.85:1), the quality veers from fine to looking like a bad video or TV print, sometimes from shot to shot. However, in the absence od a proper DVD release to date, it's acceptable if you're not expecting too much. The DVD features German main titles but an English soundtrack option with removeable subtitles and also includes a UK trailer and stills gallery.",1170460800,8,1962,4.75366568914956
