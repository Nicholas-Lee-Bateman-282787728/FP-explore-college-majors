Sister Angelia (Deborah Kerr - absolutely fantastic (Oscar Nominated for Best Actress)) as a missionary nun and U.S. Marine Corporal Allison (Robert Mitchum - perfectly casted truly) who are stranded on an island in Japanese occupied territory.  Their 2 faiths (hers in God & his in the Corps)bring them together and provide each other the strength to overcome over whelming odds.
""Heaven Knows Mr. Allison"" is a great family picture.  Is so delightful & entertaining (the story line is a pleasant surprise). Kerr & Mitchum are magical together.  Don't miss this one.  I guarantee you will be watching this one more than once.  This is a great movie to buy!!

869641,4,6304397941,"Robert Mitchum stars as a tough marine who washes up on the shore of an island in the South Pacific and finds Deborah Kerr, a nun.  The priest she was working with at a mission is dead, the Japanese having come through.  Together, the unlikely duo forge a real friendship and struggle to survive against illness, the elements, and of course, the Japanese who make repeated trips to the island.
The acting is terrific, with Mitchum and Kerr the only characters on screen.  Mitchum displays his range here, at times tough and uncouth, and at other times kind and doting.  Kerr is equally fine, never letting her performance dissolve into a nun caricature, giving Sr. Angela an internal strength and shy sense of humour.
The action moves along well, with director John Huston expertly pacing and scripting the film so that the characters are allowed to develop without sacrificing the action and tension of the war.  It's an honest film with real characters both devoted to their causes, and by the end you can't help but like and admire the both of them.",1054944000,4,1052,4.726775956284153
869642,2,6304397941,"""Heaven Knows Mr. Allison"" is the engaging tale of a nun (Deborah Kerr)quietly going about her Christian duties on a deserted island who, one day, discovers a stranded, lone American officer (Robert Mitchum) in her midst.  Although the relationship is marred by each other's criticism from the onset, a friendship developes that, for Mr. Allison, spells romance.  As this is quite out of the question...see the movie and find out how it ends!
TRANSFER: WHAT A MESS! Fox gives us this movie in such poor shape that one wonders why they bothered to release it at all.  The visual elements are marred by color fading and bleeding, orangy flesh tones and excessive film grain.  Worse, there is an abundance of camera flicker and chips and scratches throughout the original camera negative.  We also get some pretty heavy pixelization, edge enhancement and shimmering that add another layer to the distortions.
Audio - OH HEAVENS! - labeled as stereo (I'm not sure whether that's a deliberate lie or just wishful thinking),  the audio on this disc is so incredibly muffled that there is absolutely nothing to recommend it.  It is not natural sounding or even remotely engaging and, save a few isolated examples where I think I detected some action in the side and rear speakers, I don't believe anyone in their right mind would classify it as anything but an undistinguished MONO MESS! Not even old Japanese kung-fu movies sound this bad!
Extras: Of course, nothing to write home about.  A movietones trailer and the original theatrical trailer.
BOTTOM LINE: There is nothing even remotely adequate about this DVD presentation.  You would do better to pray to heaven that the staff responsible for the mastering of this disc are no longer in the employ of the studio!",1053388800,12,1762,4.925675675675675
869643,5,6304397941,"Although, I do not own this movie (yet) I have seen It A dozen times. I love it! My father,being A Marine during W.W.2,the movie held special meaning for me. Here are two people with such totally different beliefs and lifestyles, stranded on an island togther. Alone! I mean how much more ironic can you get! A Marine and A nun! You realize as you watch the movie, that they are not as different as you would think. They are both proud of what they believe in and what they stand for. The tensions they experience,as a man and woman together and later the respect for one another are beautiful!",1021075200,8,594,4.409090909090909
869644,4,6304397941,"Robert Mitchum is absolutely winning as the Marine who washes ashore on an island in the Pacific during World War II.  Wary of stumbling into enemy troops, he is, instead, surprised to find a nun (Deborah Kerr) stranded and completely alone on the island.  The film focuses on their bonding, survival on the island, and the threat of Japanese capture.
*** Mitchum and Kerr have undeniable chemistry.  Modern audiences may find it quaint, but I've always been disarmed by the profound courtesy they show one another.  It's difficult not to smile with pleasure at even their simplest exchanges (""Are you all right, ma'am?""  ""Yes, Mr. Allison."").  There's a wonderful lilt to Kerr's voice and an integrity that makes someone as religiously devoted as Sister Angela believable.
*** This is one of the best movies no one talks about.  I've seen it countless times now, and it's joined the immortal ranks of ""Casablanca"" as a sure thing -- always as good as the first time you saw it.",1005696000,27,978,4.820359281437126
869645,5,6304397941,"I saw this film for the first time in 1962 while sitting on my father's lap. I was eight years old. It immediately became a favorite of mine and remained so for many years. I think it was the first really ""adult"" movie I ever saw. I was transfixed by every aspect of the film: the romance of a deserted island, the ""evil"" Japanese soldiers, the intense musical score, the mystery of a nun dressed in an all white habit and, most of all, Robert Mitchum's raw animal magnetism. Of course, as a child of eight, I would never have used the phrase raw animal magnetism, nor even have known what it meant. And I certainly didn't pick up on the sexual tension between the Marine and Nun. All I knew was that Mr. Allison (as played by Mr. Mitchum) had a rare combination of masculinity, selfless bravery, and sensitivity that made my heart go pitter pat.
I just finished watching this film for perhaps the twentieth time. I now see it through the eyes of a mature woman who knows about romantic love, WWII, devotion and bravery -- and I enjoyed it just as much as I did forty years ago. It is still one of my two favorite war films. The other being The Bridge on the River Kwai.",1004140800,7,1170,4.298642533936651
869646,5,6304397941,"When you think about it, this is basically a two-member cast that is asked to hold your attention for nearly two hours.  They do, and they owe some of it to John Huston, the director, but most of it to their own performances and to the grip of the story line.  I've heard and read many stories describing how difficult this movie was to produce, given the climate and the director.  It shows in the faces of the actors, but then they situation they find themselves in as part of the story is not an easy one.  I'm glad I've not lived anyplace where people were trying to shoot me, and I am very greatful that I have never been faced with killing anyone else.  I don't know if I would find the faith to do what the characters do in this story, but I can only hope so.",973555200,3,766,4.114093959731544
869647,5,6304397941,"Robert Mitchum is a marine, Deborah Kerr an Irish nun, and they are stuck on an island together.  Sounds familiar? Well, think again!
 This movie isn't like any other movie I've ever seen. The chemistry between the two  leads is so powerful, and yet they don't even share a kiss! (You really  want them too, though)It is so moving, and at the end of the film you are  so attached to the two characters you hate to see them go...
 Deborah  Kerr gives a brilliant performance, and so does Robert Mitchum. If you want  to see people act with only their eyes, this is the film for it! Also, John  Huston's direction is very good.  One of my all-time favourites. You'll  love it.",956620800,12,674,4.3983739837398375

870327,4,6304397941,"A young Marine, Corporal Allison (Robert Mitchem), washes up on the shore of a south Pacific island in the middle of World War II. The only resident is one Irish nun named Angela (Deborah Kerr) who had come to help a priest. The priest has died. The island has plenty of natural food and water, certainly enough for two people. Unfortunately, the Japanese arrive and set up a small base, forcing the soldier and the nun to hide in a cave and survive on the meagerest of supplies. Can they hold out long enough to get saved?

The story focuses on the relationship between Mr. Allison and Sister Angela. They come from very different backgrounds and have lead very different lives. Their initial awkwardness is overcome by an understanding of each other through the hardness of their vocations. Marine life requires tough discipline; a nun's vows leave off almost every earthly pleasure. Together, they experience both happiness and tension as they deal with the situation. The development of their friendship is very thoughtful, believable, and engaging.

The story has more tension than action. Allison sneaks around when the Japanese are there; he doesn't try to take them on Rambo-style, which is definitely good. American forces show up at the end of the movie and the action picks up. By that point viewers are so invested in the characters that they are more worried for the characters than they are excited to see some fighting. The balance between tension and action serves the story and the characters well.

This movie is a hidden gem among the glut of World War II movies.",1482364800,,1582,4.830258302583026

870778,5,6304397941,"Like many other viewers, I really love this movie. Virtually the entire movie is performed by two actors.  The characters have to deal with profound cultural differences and of course gender issues.  For me it is impossible to watch this movie and not be a permanent fan of both actors.

I also am an avid reader.  One of my hobbies is reading novels and then watching the movies that are based on these novels.  As often as not, being a reader, I prefer the novel.  However there are some notable exceptions.  This is such an exception.  The novel this excellent movie is based on bears the same name.  It is a relatively short and otherwise forgettable work by an Australian author.  It is significantly different than the movie, but generally follows a similar story line.  Unless you are a dedicated reader with no life, (Like Me!) you can watch the movie and skip the short novel.

It is interesting to me that two of my favorite World War II movies that came from fairly average novels both starred Robert Mitchum.  The other is The Enemy Below, another great movie that is based ona fairly average novel.  Robert Mitchum was also in another movie that is a classic that comes from a novel that is just OK.  The movie is Cape Fear in which Robert Mitchum co stars with Gregory Peck.  That movie is based on a novel The Executioners, which is OK but not as good as the movie.",1451347200,,1380,4.481927710843373

871801,5,6304397941,One of the all time great war movies with a cast of Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr. Mitchum is a WWII US Marine who washes up on an island in the Japanes held Pacific. The only other inhabitant is a nun played by Deborah Kerr. The interaction between the two stars is very entertaining and the arrival of the Japanese soldiers to occupy the island lends some drama to what is an unrequited love story. This movie should be part of everyones movie collection or you should make the effort to see it at least once. It's marvellous what can be acheived on a small budget with a good story and two great actors. Value for money.,1416096000,,625,4.35042735042735

I've seen Mitchum in a variety of films, but this one was particularly interesting, with the nun having to decide what it was she really wanted out of life. I expected it to end differently, but the ending it had was satisfying enough. If you haven't seen it, get out the popcorn, sit back, and enjoy Mitchum in a well-played role.

However, not every movie I liked in my youth gives me pleasure now. Therefore, I was delighted. My daughter saw it for the first time and liked it as did my son-in-law. I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie.

Robert Mitchum is very believable, and who is a better actor then Deborah Kerr. I think she was even better in this than in The King and I, because of the material. A spell-binder. So, don't let the title fool you!",1402790400,,603,4.153846153846154

In the midst of war and hiding from the enemy, the marine maintains his integrity, and acts with utmost respect toward the nun.  He does a heroic deed towards the end of the story.

872751,4,6304397941,"A good story line, that actually was believable except for the careless way that the character played by Robert Mitchum hazarded himself by careless exposure to enemy detection. How they missed spotting him on several occasions is beyond me. I enjoyed the movie because it was good, clean entertainment.",1400457600,,303,5.204081632653061
872752,4,6304397941,Mitchum has been an over-looked super star for years.  This movie is proof of it.  Deborah Kerr is supposed to be the star in this movie but Mitchum carries her.,1399852800,,161,4.333333333333333

Apparently my mind played some tricks on me over 50 years, and the lifeline of the movie was just a bit different than I remembered it.  It was better! The movie reinforces one of the fundamental tenants of Christiana: love is fundamental.  The movie genre celebrates the fact that love can take many forms, but true love is not just physical.",1399420800,,416,4.52
872825,4,6304397941,We love the older classics and this one was no exception. Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr were the perfect match. Great suspense. Our only disappointment was the ending.

872931,4,6304397941,"This is a great classic film that tells the story of two people from completely different backgrounds. The nun played by Deborah Kerr is kind, compassionate and totally devoted to her religion, to God, and to the life she has chosen. Robert Mitchum plays Mr. Allison, a rough marine. Both are standed on an island infested with Japanese during World War II and struggling to survive. Although his approach is kill and she is the opposite, they grow to respect and love one another over time.

It's really a ""relationship"" movie under very difficult circumstances both because of the war setting and the dichotomy of the attraction between a Marine and a Catholic Nun.  It has drama, pathos and humor which is a rare combination in most movies.  I highly recommend this film.

Another excellent, although somewhat different, Robert Mitchem movie is: The Enemy Below.",1397520000,,516,5.333333333333333

I thought the acting was tremendous especially on Robert Mitchem's part,  I took it to my daughter's and we watched it together...;
too bad the movies of today are not nearly as good.  The movies of today throw in special effects and violence, and people go
for it.  I don't get it....I think they don't know any better since they grew up with stuff like that.  Anyway, it's probably my age, but maybe not since my kids like the old movies I see with them.  Thanks again,

He was actually a WWII veteran, serving with the Marines who fought in the bloody South Pacific theater, including many islands similar to the one pictured in this classic film.  He actually wrote one of the most memorable lines in the movie, taking from his personal experiences in that conflict.  Uncle Harold also co-produced the Liza Minelli masterpiece, ""Cabaret,"" and went on to author the novel, ""Cafe Berlin,"" which went on to equal success, both here and abroad.  Before Bob Mitchum began working with Deborah Kerr, he was afraid that she was a bit too ""innocent"" to work with him, but during a scene in which he was standing in the ocean, he heard Kerr swear at the director ""like a pissed off sailor,"" which immediately made him fall in love with her.  They remained good friends for the rest of their lives.  This movie is pure magic, combining the best of both these actors' abundant gifts as none other.",1390089600,,1036,4.65934065934066

I find definitions of love from my Bible, and this film did a fine job of displaying the difference between agape, the love that God commands (think love one another as God loves us); eros, love between man and woman, and philia, love of family, friends, and in Mitchum's character, his love for the Marine Corps. The story is well done in defining the character of each kind of love and doing it with what I call ""class"".Kerr exhibits the agape so well and understood what Mitchum's character was experiencing.
I don't know if Hollywood could make it so real today. In fact, I don't know if they were trying to make these definitions but it came out that way and is well worth watching.",1374192000,2,836,4.506578947368421

Yet, the humor she displays does much to mitigate the idea that nuns are stern, unbending and rigid. Mitchum excels in his role as a marine washed ashore on this tropical island, whose sole inhabitant is Sister Angela. One of my all time favorite films; it combines elements of danger, romance, pathos, and humor in an elegant script that doesn't wander into forbidden territory, but handles the emotions of the leading characters deftly, allowing them full range of their acting abilities.",1370908800,,665,5.166666666666667

They do have much in common, both serving and saving the the world in their own important way!  The tough Marine brings to the table the skills to survive in the wild against a formidable enemy, while the Nun brings more faith and spirituality to the forefront of their interaction!  The sum total of what they each bring to their shared circumstance ultimately is how they both grow as individuals while having the opportunity to save each other from a dire situation, where if they didn't have each other the prospect of survival would be very dim.  A genuine friendship and love grows between them that can never be anything more, but, nonetheless they will be in each others hearts forever, just as this story will touch your heart!  This is when they made movies that could stand on the merit of a simple story line with great character development, fine actors and direction.  Mainly because the story had merit and significance to anyone with a heart who knows about or wants to understand better the human need for companionship and closeness to another in any situation.  And, how a man and a woman can have a dignified, respectful, close relationship that is totally non sexual.  The cinematography is beautiful, set in the South Pacific during World War II.

874336,5,6304397941,"A beautifully shot duet between two excellent actors at the peak of their careers with in a film built by the hands of a master filmmaker, `Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison' sounds like a dumb film but it really is anything but.

Robert Mitchum plays Mr. Allison, a marine who gets stranded on an island after being cast adrift in the Pacific Ocean.  After giving search, he finds a sole inhabitant; a nun.  That nun is beautifully played by Deborah Kerr, one of the greatest actresses EVER.  The film swells in unity as these two comrades feed off one another, working together to sustain their lives on the island.  With the impending threat of Japanese soldiers, Mr. Allison and Sister Angela have to stick ever closer, and thus grow ever closer to one another, as they strive to survive.  What is so remarkable is the depth that is drawn out of a film that basically places two members of the opposite sex in a situation where the obvious would be to get romantic and yet what is born is a beautiful friendship that says more than many `romance' films say.

The action sequences are impeccably crafted for a film of the 50's.  The film is beautiful to look at with sweeping, lush cinematography and the script is fantastic; fleshing out these two characters in a way that makes the film feel truthful and earnest.  Kerr is tremendous as Sister Angela, and Robert Mitchum is the perfect `man' here; using his physical girth to balance out the soft heart he develops as the film presses forward.

The film's title may be somewhat silly, but what this film contains is anything but.",1336089600,,1576,4.616487455197133

874338,5,6304397941,"I remember seeing parts of this movie on TV when I was a teenager many years ago. I had to grow up to understand and grab the magnitude of what was going on here: a young man and an attractive woman stranded on an island in a remote place in the pacific, but the significant part is that she is a nun. He is a gentleman, a Word War II marine, respectful of religion, and women, even when his background had not been, say, very straight forward.

I thought this was another movie about World War II, and as a kid, I was not much encouraged. But the war is only a backdrop here; the real action is about a human couple so caring for each other that they fall in love. No, there are no love scenes, or sex, for that matter on this movie. Love is subtle, it simply grows unnoticeable until it can't be ignored any more.

The nun (Deborah Kerr), is naturally beautiful, even with freckles, as Robert Mitchum (Mr. Allison) says in one of his lines. She is also funny when you see her running with her nun's outfit behind Mr. Mitchum to reach the beach. And Robert Mitchum is a very caring man, to the point of killing and risking his own life in order to get dry blankets from the Japanese camp in the island for her, as she was sick and with chills.

Even with the invasion of the Japanese and a lot of soldiers around, the only dialog throughout the whole movie is just between the nun and the marine. If you saw Tom Hanks' ""Cast Away"" and were surprised of one person carrying most of the film, you'll be even more surprised that on ""Heaven knows"", only two people carried the whole film.

Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr are at their best in this movie, as actors, and also as a couple on the screen. They actually did other movies together in their youth, and after a two-decade hiatus, they got together again as a couple for ""Reunion at Fairborough"". It feels like a continuation of this film, many years later.",1332547200,8,1912,4.28808864265928

874342,5,6304397941,"Dictionary.com defines ""intrigue"" as ""to arouse the curiosity or interest of by unusual, new, or otherwise fascinating or compelling qualities"", and that's what this movie did for me.  After seeing The Sundowners, I wanted to see the movie that Mitchum and Kerr had been in before The Sundowners.  They are both remarkably versatile actors!  They couldn't be more different on this and The Sundowners!  For the entire movie (Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison), the characters call each other ""Ma'am"" and ""Mr. Allison"" (he calls her ""Sister Angela"" only once or twice).  It's interesting that the same director, John Huston, did another movie with the characters addressing themselves formally on their adventures:  The African Queen.  The camerawork does really well at creating a first-person feeling by bobbing as Mr. Allison moves and viewing the Japanese from his vantage point, as well as almost always putting him and the nun (Kerr) in close contact, so you feel like you're with them.  Kerr does a good job revealing the fear her character has, adding depth to what could be just a bland and stuck-up personality.  She puts on an Irish accent but doesn't make it sound silly like an actor's natural tendency might be.  I really like the military aspect of this movie, for Mitchum has to make brief incursions into Japanese territory without being discovered.  It's more of a human interest story than a romance, and like the Gregory Peck-Audrey Hepburn movie Roman Holiday, stresses the supremacy of duty over personal feelings.  ""The joy is in the journey"", as they say.  And I suppose the one good long-term thing Mr. Allison gets out of the adventure is a personal experience with God, which he'd never had before (hence the title).  The back of the DVD says it offers a ""surprising blend of suspense and humor"", which sums it up nicely.",1316304000,5,1839,4.947882736156352

874423,5,6304397941,"Now what makes this movie so great?

Sure, John Huston is a great director.  And sure Robert Mitchum is a good actor.  But I'll tell you in two words what makes this movie superb ... Deborah Kerr.

Robert Mitchum is good but Deborah Kerr carries the movie.  She's in virtually every scene and yet I doubt if anyone in the audience get tired of ""observing her.""

She was also directed by John Huston in ""Night of the Iguana"" and she, quite simply, stole the movie from all the other actors -- Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, Sue Lyons.

It's a shame that she wasn't in more quality movies.  Or that she wasn't directed in more movies by John Huston.  I have the feeling that macho types such as John Huston and Robert Mitchum and Richard Burton respected her as ""a grand dame.""  A ballsy gal.

The brillance of this movie is not just casting her one-on-one with Robert Mitchum but making her a nun.  The sexual subtext of this movie is fascinating, especially given that it was made back in the 1950s.  If it was made even a few years later in the 1960s, when films began to become more sexually liberated, it wouldn't have carried the same electric charge that it does as a '50s movie.

Some famous director, I don't recall his name, perhaps it was Alfred Hitchcock, said that if a movie is good you should be able to understand and appreciate it with the sound turned off.  In other words, the visual images alone should tell you what's going on with the characters.

Take Robert Mitchum.  As the movie opens, he ""evolves"" before our very eyes.  He emerges from the ocean: slick, prehistoric, serpentine.  He then becomes an upright biped, and finally thinking, calculating man, his primary concern being self-preservation.

He's come right out of Thomas Hobbes' or perhaps Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ""state of nature.""

The first thing he sees is the first institution of a civilized society -- a church.

Whereupon he sees -- a woman.  Wrapped in the *intent* of society's first institution.  And that intention, the intention of the church, the intention of religion, is, for better or for worse, to tame and otherwise sublimate that which has crawled -- free, natural and wild -- from the sea onto land: homo erectus.

From that point on, the entire movie revolves around an obvious, irresistible, undeniable question -- How does homo erectus (Robert Mitchum) survive on an island, a perilous island, with someone who, in all respects, is his polar opposite.

Deborah the Nun is peaceful, nonviolent.  Robert the Marine is violent, warline.

Deborah the Nun is pure, chaste.  Robert the Marine is not.

Alone, Deborah the Nun would probably either perish or else surrender to the Japanese.  Robert the Marine would rather die than surrender.

That at a certain point in the movie it becomes clear to the audience that were not that Deborah Kerr is a nun, this would be an absolutely ideal ""marriage"" -- with or without the legality of a mariage license.  Meaning: by the end of the movie it's obvious that the most *natural* thing in the world is for Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum to sexually consummate their relationship.  Except of course all through the movie we know just as surely that that will *never* happen.  The polarity of the magnets reversed, the closer Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum get to each other, the farther the categorical imperative requires them to move away from each other.

This is an almost ideal structure for a visual medium.

Add to this the fact that  John Huston was working with not just two great actors but also two actors who excelled at communicating *nonverbally.*  Robert Mitchum's physiognomy and Deborah Kerr's physiognomy are perfect for this movie.  It could just as easily been a solent movie and it would have been as powerful.

I read a book a while ago of various interviews John Huston has given over the years and what he always comes back to is the importance of ""proper casting.""  If you get the casting right, he maintains, you're more than half the way home.  And this movie is a perfect example of that.

A few years before ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison"" was made, ""The African Queen,"" also directed by John Huston, tried to do the same reversal-of-polarities with Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in the leads.  But, for me, it just didn't work.  What makes ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison"" a better movie, for me at least, is that I can imagine what Deborah Kerr -- as a nun, mind you -- would be like in the throes of sexual excitement, that being the omnipresent subtext in ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison,"" whereas Katherine Hepburn in ""The African Queen,"" also playing a messnger of God, a missionary, just doesn't do it for me.  Her getting it on with Humphrey Bogart would just make me laugh.  Sort of like watching your grandparents have sex.

If Bogart in ""The African Queen"" strips to the waist (I can't recall if he actually did, I don't think so), what you register is a guy 52 years old (his actual age when the movie was made, Robert Mitchum I believe was about 37 years old), somewhat pale, soon to die of lung cancer, and anything but virile, serpentine and sensual.

So this is a case of the sequel, ""Heaven Knows Mister Alllison,"" being, at least to my way of thinking not just a better movie but also a movie that actually accomplished what ""The African Queen"" set out to accomplish but didn't.

Huphrey Bogart is what I would call an ""indoor actor.""  Robert Mitchum is an ""outdoor actor.""  (Their first names alone reinforce that image.)

Katherine Hepburn is what in Texas they would call "" all hat but no cowboy.""  I  don't see Katherine Hepburn as sexual in any way.  She's asexual.  Which is fine if you're making a documentary.  But if a filmmaker is trying to tell a story that features a man and a woman .. and one of them is asexual .. then you have a problem.

Actually I think this is one reason why Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn movies were so popular.  They were *both* asexual!  As such, they were kind of a freak show, for won't of a better description.

You can't tell me that you actually could envision Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn doing the nasty, whether as characters in a movie or else in real life.  Whereas Deborah Kerr -- say in ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison"" or ""Night of the Iguana"" or ""An Affair to Remember"" -- is sexually intriguing, wouldn't you agree?  In a way that Katherine Hepburn can't even get near to!

What, after all, is Cary Grant trying to accomplish in ""An Affair to Remember"" other than to get Deborah Kerr in a prehistoric, pre-civilized, pre-religious, *sexual* situation.

Even the fact that one of them is crippled doesn't take away from that thought in the audience's mind.

Here's the ultimate test.  Put Katherine Hepburn in ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison"" instead of Deborah Kerr.  Does that work for you?  For me it spoils the entire movie, big time.  What you believe without question throughout ""Heaven Knows Mister Allison"" is that somewhere in the back of Robert Mitchum's mind he's wondering what Deborah Kerr would be like as a lover.

That's what the movie is all about.  That dynamic is so strong and yet it's simply and effortlessly portrayed.  One gets the feeeling that once cast, Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr could have ad-libbed the entire movie!

Personally, I can't think of any other movie that creates such a compelling dynamic between a man and a women; and in such a economical, minimalist way.",1263945600,4,7456,4.695216049382716

A ""two character"" movie that I like a lot. Mitchum is a U.S. Marine who is stranded at sea and washes up on what appears to be a deserted island in the south Pacific during World War II. He soon runs into Kerr who is a nun that has been left alone on the island after the death of an ailing priest she had stayed on the island with to care for. A Japanese force comes to the island to establish an observation station and the bulk of the movie is taken up with the soldier and the nun trying to avoid detection and stay alive until the Americans can take the island from the Japanese. Along the way, each is forced to re-examine their lives. The film was directed by John Huston.

874496,4,6304397941,"When a movie's whole cast consists of two people, a lot of its success depends on these characters being likable or at least interesting.  John Huston's Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison then is a huge success because of the performances from Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum.  Somewhere in the Pacific in 1944, Corporal Allison, a U.S. Marine, floats up on a quiet Pacific island in a life raft after being separated from his men.  He discovers an empty island except for one occupant, a pretty nun named Sister Angela.  Teaming up, the two must try and survive the war, all the while hoping Allied forces come their way and discover the little island paradise.  This is storytelling at its best.  There aren't any distractions, just the relationship of friendship, and maybe more, that grows between Allison and Sister Angela.  There is tension when a Japanese company lands to set up a weather station, but the movie rises and falls with its leads.  It's a great movie that all moviegoers should enjoy.

Riding high after the huge success of The King and I, the very beautiful Deborah Kerr stars as Sister Angela, a faith-filled nun who ends up on the island because of her devotion to her beliefs.  Kerr was a perfect choice for the part because she was classically pretty which makes the relationship between her and Allison understandable. As Corporal Allison, Robert Mitchum gives one of his best performances.  He was such a cool presence it's often taken for granted what a good actor Mitchum was, and he gets a prime chance to show off his chops here.  And because Kerr and Mitchum are such a good team together with a ton of chemistry, the movie works, plain and simple.

The DVD is a good buy, starting with the widescreen presentation.  Filmed in Trinidad and Tobago, the movie looks great in its widescreen presentation.  Special features include a trailer, four MovieTone clips from WWII running about 7 minutes, and trailers for a handful of other ""Fox War Classics.""

This is high praise from someone who made such classics as ""Night of the Hunter"" and ""The Sundowners"".  After watching it you can see why.  The film is essentially a two character story (the occupying Japanese soldiers are in essence extras) which gives Mitchum the opportunity to stretch his acting muscles.  As a co-star you can't have one better than Deborah Kerr.  The film also demonstrates the tender side of director John Huston, a man known more for his cynicism and dark humor.  Sure, there is a certain degree of action and tension in the film.  At it's heart, though, it's about love of the unrequited nature and that's the most painful love there can be.  I saw this film many years ago on the late show (pre-cable) and it stayed with me.  ""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison"" has lost none of it's resonance years later.

When the Japanese invade, they face another threat to their survival and have to confront the unique relationship that begins to develop between them.  While it is essentially a 'two-hander', this special tale has been filmed on a grand scale - on location on a beautiful island with elaborate staging of the Japanese invasion and occupation.  We also glimpse on-the-horizon battles and aerial bombardments that are realistically staged, along with some thrills as the marine confronts the invaders.  However, it is the almost-romantic relationship between the nun and the marine that makes this a moving film.  Kerr and Mitchum are excellent!

Robert Mitchcum is Corporal Allison ,a US Marine ,whose ship is sunk and who comes ashore on the island to discover he is not quite alone as also in residence is Sister Angela (Deborah Kerr).They make plans to esacpe on a raft but the Japanese move in and establish a weather base there ,forcing the pair to go in hiding in a cave .From time to time he must venture out to raid the Japanese camp for food and these scenes are very well handled by director John Huston.
The screenplay ,co-written by Huston and John Lee Martin is excellent and the editing by Russell Lloyd is fluid and inventive .Add some lush Technicolor photography from the ever reliable British lensman Oswald Morris and the technical aspects are in safe hands .What keeps this as a constant pleasure however is more than anything the interpaly between the two leading figures. Mitchum and Kerr worked well together a reflection of the great affection they held for each other away from the screen .(In separate interviews on a UK chat show -Parkinson -in the 1980's they spoke of each other with genuine unsimulated warmth)The scenes between them are tender and moving ,and shot through with a kind of sorrow for their love  which while it is  real must ever be platonic only

874595,5,6304397941,"Very few war films have a script with just two characters and all the lines in the movie are spoken by those two characters only.  One wouldn't think this would be a war film, but it is.  This classic WWII war film focuses on the pinacole of opposite human beings, thrust together and forced to survive on each other's individual strengths.  Mr. Allison (R. Mitchum) is the marine who beaches on an island after being cast a drift in the Pacific Ocean for several days.  There he searches the island and finds only one living person: a nun.  Sister Angela (D. Kerr) is a dedicated nun who accompanied a priest to the island but got marooned there instead, and the priest dying a day or so later.  Mr. Allison and Sister Angela work as a team on the island in order to sustain themselves.  They do everything together: they gather island fruit, fish for turtles, build a sail, and have deep conversations about each other's contrary occupations and past.

 The character of Mr. Allison is brilliantly developed and is easily likeable among viewers.  He is portrayed as a big dumb guy, with a soft heart and top marine skills.  He's clumsy with words and he's very open about his feelings, which at times puts Sister Angela in uncomfortable positions.  Equally developed is Sister Angela, who is greatly sympathized by the many stresses she is forced to endure.  She rarely speaks unless spoken to by Mr. Allison, as she is obviously uncomfortable around him half the time. But as the picture progresses, she becomes more and more accustomed with having him around and a mutual fondness for each other develops.

 The film is highly original and thorougly entertaining.  Although it's a movie about a man and woman, it is not a romance.  Even though they are alone on an island together, there's no hint of carnal pleasure for each other.  Instead, the movie shows how a man and woman can form a relationship of trust, not just in order to survive, but because they are alone together.  It is a movie of friends, not lovers, which is very unusual of Hollywood.  The results are phenominally entertaining and realistic.

 Since it is a war film, there are explosions and guns and some action sequences, but most of it is toned down.  Set in the Pacific Theatre during WWII, there are Japanese marines depicted in the film, but no characters are established amongst them.  If any criticism is due for this film it is the need for a more satisfactory ending.  There is quite a bit of silence throughout the movie, a lot of sounds from the ocean and exotic birds chirping.  It's as relaxing as it is entertaining.

 The film is rated G, there is no language (certainly not from Sister Angela!) and no indecency of any kind.  Some blood, but it's not worth hiding a kid's eyes over.  Only if one is offended by Catholicism or someone getting drunk on Japanese liquor would this film have any form of warnings at all.

 To summarize, Heaven Knows Mr. Allison is an original kind of war movie with highly developed characters.  It's an uncommon film in today's market of entertainment in regards to what a man and woman can do together.  This film shows the sexes not at odds or in lust with each other, but shows them as a team working toward a common goal.  It's easily a family film and a movie worth watching time and again.",1151193600,62,3319,4.6058020477815695

I got this to see Mitchum, after reading his biography, and must admit, though he and Kerr are good, the story doesn't flow very energetically, and the vitality of the situation is not maintained throughout.

The two of them hit it off well, and then must contend with two instances of Japanese occupation of the island. All the while they hide in a cave, he taking care of her, she never leaving or removing her long, billowing habit, white-though gradually stained and muddied.

The best parts are Mitchum's gentle, then rough come-ons, clearly the crank of the action. Perhaps because this was made in 1957, to present 1944, my sensibilities are less wholesome. But watching with my girlfriend, she too wanted more to happen. Kerr's ""Ma'am"" never stops calling Mitchum ""Mr. Allison,"" he never finding out her name. Kerr's ""Ma'am"" also never gets to express her strength of faith against the bounding masculinity of Mitchum (surely one of the reasons he had the part), and there is no visceral dilemma for her, which I missed.

Perhaps this is a sadder piece then it seems. Will they ever know each other's love? Is he just an unlucky clunk, imprisoned and unrequited? Is their being thrown together by the horrors of war a cruel joke of the universe, bad timing and an expression of the futility of people?

I love everything about this film--the scenery, the suspense and most of all the gentle and trusting relationship that develops between the Marine and the nun. But there is never anything inappropriate between them. It is handled perfectly. Ultimately, she is fully committed to her vows and he is fully committed to being a gentleman. The film shows the beauty and meaning of a religious vocation. It's also interesting to see them discover similarities in how they both serve something greater than themselves and how he learns what her vocation is really all about.
