8310327,5,B001I0N99A,"I nearly bought this film in a visit to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris but decided on a couple others.  Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  Very interesting film about Nolde's life with many color shots of his paintings.  If you like his work, you'll enjoy this film.",1431302400,,266,4.176470588235294
