8037308,1,B00062IXYM,"This is a tragic movie. Not tragic in a profound sense, just tragic that it was ever made...There is no plot just some idiot serial killer who cuts up bad actresses in his apartment. I would try to resell this DVD on Amazon but it is only selling for $2.00 so its not even worth the cost of shipping...",1178323200,,302,4.135593220338983
8037309,1,B00062IXYM,"If I was able to give this thing a negative star, I would give it 3. The acting was horrendous, the actors couldn't speak their lines above a whisper, and there were some ridiculous inconsistencies in this movie. There is one scene where a hooker goes missing, and her pimp breaks into her apartment looking for her. Idiotic. The pimp is followed by a hot blond brandishing two guns in all the rooms (who was she? unknown. why a pair of guns?). The pimp discovers her camcorder (sitting on the coffee table, of all places!) and discovers that she recorded her own abduction (the table it's on is nowhere near a window, let alone tall enough to see outside, and she'd been abducted in a car).

Utter garbage. No motivation is given for the killer. The actress playing his wife sees him walk thru the house on numerous occasions, covered in blood, and only asks him about it once.

Unmitigated trash. Glad I ONLY rented it. Still wasn't worth the 3.79 for the rental.",1096848000,4,965,4.540229885057471
