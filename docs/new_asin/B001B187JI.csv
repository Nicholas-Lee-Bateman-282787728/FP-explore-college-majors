8281075,5,B001B187JI,"some of the video quality is like older VHS, but still not bad at all
pop them in and they play with subtitles all ready to go
some of the video quality is actually on a few of the movies

all that being said and considering other review input
Imo, this is a great selection of Takashi Mike's movies for the price
and covers a variety of plots which makes them fun.

for the price, it's a great deal imo",1309824000,5,403,4.025
8281076,4,B001B187JI,"An ""omnibus"" will unlikely ever really truly exist for Takashi Miike's work, because he's made over 70 films/tv series.  Such an omnibus would be impossible due to the inconceivable work and impractical cost of securing distribution rights to 70+ films, which vary from country to country.
That being said, this is a pretty decent box set, at a very good price, which includes all Miike films released in the US/R1 by Artsmagic.
The centerpiece of this set is the classic ""Black Society Trilogy"":Shinjuku Triad Society, Rainy Dog, and Ley Lines.  These three films are not related by story or character, but by their themes.
Young Thugs: Innocent Blood and Young Thugs: Nostalgia are two very touching films with very appropriate English language titles.  Every Miike fan's tastes differ, YT:Nostalgia is one of my top five favorites.
Full Metal Yakuza is trashy but fun.  Think Frankenyakuza or Roboyakuza.  FMY, Sabu, and Osaka Tough Guys, in my humble opinion, are rather minor films.  But considering the price of the boxed set, having 5 excellent films paired with 3 minor ones still makes a good buy.
I highly recommend this to new Miike fans, or Miike fans filling out their collection.  If you have been collecting Miike for a while, there is unlikely nothing new for you here, this is ArtsMagic repacking these films and rereleasing them together at a lower price.",1217376000,27,1373,4.96943231441048
