749073,5,6303954367,"As good as Star Trek: The Next Generation managed to get over the years on air, this, the series finale proved to be its finest hour(s).
This grand episode neatly expands on the original pilot story line and incorporates  all the richness of character developed over seven seasons.
It combines  the best elements of Star Trek: a wild mystery, the fate of humanity,  self-sacrifice, duty and those darn temporal mechanics into an engrossing  plot line that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final climax.  And climax is the word; next to this masterpiece episode, the subsequent  movies have seemed anti-climatic... good, great even, but not a leap  forward from the quality television that this episode epitomizes.
This  will appeal even to non-Trekers (although they probably won't wear the tape  out).",944092800,7,814,5.014925373134329

749168,5,6303954367,"""All Good Things..."" is the perfect final episode to the best Trek series, and one of the best television series of all time.
For TNG fans, there are a lot of wonderful moments that weaves together all of the loose ends, without interfering excessively with the story. It all fits.
Led by Patrick Stewart and John DeLancie, the acting is top notch (Q's final speech brought tears to my eyes).
Like Shakespeare's Sonnet 73, this episode is also all the sweeter because you know that it is the last. This was clearly a labor of love. It's also the rare final episode that leaves us clearly wanting more -- I can remember the merciful endings to Cheers and Seinfeld, two excellent series that had long past become parodies of themselves. With TNG, so many of us fans just wanted one more year...but if we had gotten it, would we have enjoyed the probably mediocre results?
Alas, All Good Things, even the best things, must come to an end.
BTW, Paramount, us fans want this on DVD, and we want it with all the fixin's -- interviews, outtakes, lost scenes, et al.
Enjoy!",1001203200,4,1065,4.552083333333333
749169,5,6303954367,"This episode has some incredible moments.  The future with Picard facing an incurable brain disease that has his friends doubting his sanity, but still willing to go across the galaxy just because Jean-Luc says so...the past with Picard's first shuttle ride to his new posting: The USS Enterprise...and the present, with Picard finding that he can't prove his time-traveling.  And of course, there's Q!  Though Q doesn't make as much of an appearance in this one as he has in the past (this episode is truly spotlighting Picard more than anyone else), it does show an affectionate side of Q and his view of Picard.  I hated to see the series end, but it's nice to see that it went out so well!",996105600,3,693,4.609756097560975

You'll find a very extrange and unusual scenario in where the captain has to do something that I can't tell you.

749172,5,6303954367,"Captain Picard is shifting through time.  One moment he is twenty-five years in the future, a retired ambassador tending his vineyard but suffering from Irumodic syndrome, a degenerative neurological disease. The next he finds himself seven years in the past, at the time when he took over the Enterprise and headed for their first adventure at Farpoint Station (Episodes 1 & 2).  In the present timeline the Enterprise is sent to the Romulan Neutral Zone to investigate an anomaly that has appeared in the Devron system.  The Romulans are also investigating the anomaly in force.  In the past the Enterprise heads off to investigate the anomaly as well, which convinces Picard that they must go to the Devron system in that timeline as well.  Without access to the Enterprise, Picard receives help from Captain Beverly Crusher, captain of the medical ship the USS Pasteur (and Picard's ex-wife).  With La Forge and Data on board they receive permission to enter Klingon Territory from Governor Worf.  In the past timeline Picard finally knows who is responsible for his time shifting and finds himself once again in the courtroom Q created to try humanity in ""Encounter at Farpoint.""  Apparently the trial never officially ended and the Continuum has finally reached a verdict.  The human race should be destroyed, but the Q do not have to do anything for this to happen.  The anomaly is going back in time, growing larger as it does, until it will arrive at Earth at the pivotal moment when life is created--and prevent it.  Now only will there never be life on Earth explain Q, but Picard will be the one who caused it.
Most fans rightfully think ""All Good Things..."" is superior to the trio of STNG films that have been produced so far.  The future time line allows us to find out what happens to the Enterprise crew down the road: Picard a diplomat who managed to marry and divorce Beverly Crusher in the interim, La Forge without his visor, Data a professor at Cambridge, Worf an embittered Klingon, Riker the captain of the next generation Enterprise, and veiled references to something not very nice happening to Troi.  The past timeline brings back Tasha Yar and Miles O'Brien, effectively getting the entire gang back together (except for Guinan, who would have been very useful in an episode dealing with time problems).  At stake in the episode is all life on Earth, which certainly is a problem big enough for the finale STNG episode.  At the heart of the story, as he has always been throughout the series, is Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard.  As his ex-wife says in the future when she becomes convinced he is telling the truth about what is happening, ""He's Jean-Luc Picard.  And if wants to go on one last mission, we're going to help him.""  All things considered, this is a very satisfying conclusion to the seven-year run of the series.",989884800,3,2858,4.797959183673469

I left Bangor High School in 1991 but I never stopped watching the show.  I was very sad when Gene Roddenberry passed away and when the show ended, I was both sad and hopeful for the movies that came afterward.  Encounter at Farpoint set the tone for the series and All Good Things ended it very nicely.  Since the show ended, Star Trek-First Contact has been the best movie to follow up.

Spoiler Alert:
When watching the the two hour finale; I was thinking I can't believe it's over.  We see Picard reduced to a man who works in a vineyard.  Data becomes a professor.  Geordi a writer.  I disagree when the producers claimed this couldn't be a feature film. I aquired more understanding of Q.

749175,5,6303954367,"The reason this is one of the best series finales in all of television history is that it's clearly a labor of love on behalf of the show's fans.  Unlike some series ends which merely include gratuitous flashback, or which portray a significant event such as marriage, ""All Good Things"" is 100 minutes of innovative plot that pays homage to the entire run of the series.  Building on the very first episode of the show, it creates in effect a ""bookend"" to tie the series together.  At the same time it closes out the show, it also prognosticates about what's to come and shows us a bit of series' origin.  Better still, it does so by affirming the most idealistic of Star Trek's core values, preferring to be an episode about exploration rather than conquest.
What makes it most impressive, however, is that it's ultimately about the relationships among the various crewmates.  This, more than the plot-induced time trippin'--shows how far the show has come.  Gone are those initial days of painfully awkward dialogue that made Denise Crosby (whose Tasha Yar thankfully reappears here) leave the show.  No, just as THE WRATH OF KHAN is arguably the best Star Trek movie involving the original cast, ""All Good Things"" succeeds most because we get to see what these characters mean to each other.
It's such an effective blending of dynamic plot, fan wish-fulfillment, and amazing acting (especially by Patrick Stewart), that one hopes that future editions of this story will be treated more like a movie than a mere episode.  Though Paramount doesn't have a particularly great track record of making feature-rich DVD versions of Star Trek movies, hopefully one day they'll release ""All Good Things"" on DVD with behind-the-scenes featurettes, and cast and crew commentaries.",976060800,9,1771,4.979661016949152
749176,5,6303954367,"A fine sendoff for the Next Generation, as the Enterprise sails off into the sunset (literally) of syndication.  But before it does, we get a totally cool, 2-hour special fairwell episode, which, to put it bluntly, kicks butt!
Just a FEW of the many fine things about ""All Good Things"": 1) we get to see Picard as an old man, divorced from Dr. Beverly Picard (!), and quietly tending to his family vineyard; 2) we also get to see Picard taking a shuttle with Tasha Yar to assume command of the Enterprise, right before The Next Generation began; 3) we witness a future Data having come close to success in his aim of becoming human, with emotion chip and a streak of gray in his hair that, according to his English maid, ""makes him look like a bloody skunk""; 4) the whole concept of ""anti-time,"" which is pretty mind-boggling and really cool (maybe it would give me a full head of hair again? :)) 5) the intuitive leap which finally enables Picard to solve the ""chicken and the egg"" paradox at the center of the episode, and also the way he gets people to believe him that he is not senile or crazy or whatever; 6) as Q puts it, Picard ""saves humanity...once aGAIN;"" 7) several scenes with Q and Picard were priceless, like when Q acts like an old man and pretends he can't hear Picard ask about the ANOMOLY (""what's that, you want your mommy?""); 8) we get to go back and see the beginnings of life on Earth, except this time the anti-time ""anomaly"" prevents the amino acids from coming together to form life (yikes!); 9) AT LAST, the Enterprise does what I've been waiting years to see - attacks another ship from UNDERNEATH it - you can do that in space, of course, but I don't think I had ever seen that before in Star Trek - very cool!; 10) the very end of the show, where the senior officers are playing their usual poker game, and Picard comes in, asks if he might play, and says wistfully ""I should have done this a long time ago,"" to which Troi responds warmly, ""you were always welcome;"" and 11) in general, ""All Good Things"" was motion-picture quality in terms of production, and in fact was better than ANY of the Star Trek movies to date!
The bottom line here is that this is an excellent conclusion to an excellent series - Star Trek:  The Next Generation.  Now, we can only hope that Gene Roddenberry's vision (Star Trek) will continue to ""live long and prosper"" for years to come!",975024000,4,2395,4.426303854875283

7857915,5,6303954367,"While the original crew had it better with the movies, The Next Generation was the only Star Trek TV series that I watched consistently. The show had a cast that at least equalled that of the original, boasted better production values, and plots that were intriguing and touched on varieties of concepts that Kirk, Spock, and Bones never got the chance to explore. Deep Space Nine was too mired into the whole ""war of the quadrants"" to explore any ideas with real satisfaction, and while Voyager had the best effects and the best premise, the cast was middling at best. As for Enterprise, hell, I tried to watch one episode and got too damn bored.
All Good Things..., the swan song episode for TNG, is possibly the best of Star Trek, period, focusing on mind-boggling concepts while retaining the character development and human interest that made the show so appealing. It's the seventh year that the crew of the Starhip Enterprise have been together, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is experiencing odd timeshifts. He's constantly switching between three different time periods; to the past, right before the Farpoint mission, the present, and the future, where the crew has long since split up, Picard is retired and is diagnosed with a debilitating mental illness. Naturally, the rest of the crew is skeptical (be it in any time period), but when Picard discovers the true nature of his constant shifting, he realizes it is both the means and cause with which the existence of mankind could be erased.
I hesitate to give too much away, though I doubt anyone with a passing interest in Star Trek hasn't already seen this episode. But it plays as an interesting comparison and contrast to the series' first episode, Encounter at Farpoint, which it directly ties in to with Picard's timeshifting to the past. There's been a notable improvement in the quality of the sets and the visual effects, and also the acting, the pacing, and the plot development.
All Good Things... has all the solid acting one expects from the cast, and a human touch that was missing from the latest film, Nemesis. It's interesting to note that this episode (meaning the whole series, as well) ends with the door open for all sorts of possibilites; at this time, this clearly implied the much-hyped transition to the big screen.
Unfortunately, some of the more open-ended questions this episode focused on were never even touched on. Sure, the Worf/Troi/Riker triangle was resolved, but one of my favorite ongoing side stories, the burgeoning romance between Picard and Dr. Crusher, was completely ignored in the movies. And the final scenes lead one to believe that the movies would take us to ""places"" never explored, even though the most recent film was merely a plotless action movie that didn't even have enough action to warrant the movie's existence.
Stewart is the true highlight of this episode, displaying the great acting chops he's been known for. The fact that we care for him and the rest of the crew as well, adds a sense of urgency and involvement in the proceedings that the otherwise quite frantic pace alone might not have been able to develop. The plot twists are pure Trek, each mysterious element giving away to some big revelation that only leads to more questions. The story is engrossing, the dialogue is strong, and the performances and characterizations are spot-on.
There are a few problems with All Good Things. The timeshifting obviously means we're going to see past and future versions of the cast, but everyone's aged to the extent where they can't quite pass for their more youthful selves, and the old-age makeup is never entirely convincing (Old Riker's first appearance gave me a good laugh). That said, I would like to make mention of what full-blown hotties Marina Sirtis and especially Gates McFadden became (McFadden is easily the most attractive post 50-year old actress I've ever seen).
The continuing movie series actually began quite well; Generations and First Contact were enjoyable adventures, but everything seemed to fall apart with Insurrection. Funny, All Good Things... is a title that turned out more prophetic than anyone would have guessed.

""All Good Things"", (co-directed by David Carson, from Star Trek: Generations) moves back and forth across time in an eye-appealing way.

The concepts of both changing one's future and that one's actions in the present will change that future are both admirably explicated by Picard, though be it unwillingly as evidenced by Q's whims. Unfortunately, it lacks its fifth star because ""All Good Things"" lacks one essential element. in 94 it was marketted as the final episolde of the series. Yet, I found no closure in the show. There is no notion that ""All Good Things"" is final in any sense of the word. I know  it can be  most difficult to compose an ending that is both final and open to furthering.

It features a possible ""future"" for our crew, complete with the marriage/divorce of two characters, the death of another, and a romantic triangle that always lay beneath the show's surface, along with the threat of the annihilation of the entire human race.
Acting nods, as always, go to Patrick Stewart who gets to go through three somewhat different character changes. The other cast members get a little more exposure in this expanded two-part episode. Even a crewmember from season one makes a return appearance.

While I never REALLY liked Q (played by John de Lancie), his role came full circle in this science fiction twist with shades of A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
