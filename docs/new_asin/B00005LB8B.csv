1620546,5,B00005LB8B,"OK, I'll be honest.  I haven't actually seen this tape yet, but I've been lucky enough to see these guys perform their ""abridged"" versions of the master works live a couple of times.  ABSOLUTELY LAUGH OUT LOUD HILARIOUS.  And this from a woman who doesn't find much funny (Monty Python, Elizabeth Peters and Margaret Cho are about the extent).  BUY THIS TAPE.  Support this troupe.

1620547,5,B00005LB8B,"The Reduced Shakespeare Co. is by far the funniest production i have ever come to see.  i would have never thought that being stuck in English class and reading shakespeare would ever pay off.  i get the jokes more than my friends do but either way if you've read 1 book by willy or you've read them all this movie, book, and play are a worthy investment.
  if i may make a sugestion: don't READ shakespeare... i swear they've probably made a movie of it.",1000771200,4,455,4.317647058823529
1620548,5,B00005LB8B,"I got this video a month or two ago, and it's keeping me in stitches! Even if you don't know any Shakespeare at all, this video would still crack you up.",997056000,2,153,3.967741935483871
1620549,4,B00005LB8B,"When the Reduced Shakespeare Company performs <The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)>, it is a case of three apparently indefatigable actors (Adam Long, Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor) whirlwinding through the plays, some of which are barely mentioned, some of which are treated at greater length--all in 90 minutes. Well,  the Good News is that the show is now available from Acorn Media on a VHS. (Note: this video contains material not shown on PBS.)
  To cut to the chase, you really have to know your Bard to get all the jokes. Treating ""Titus Andronicus"" as a cooking class works if you are familiar enough with the plot (the recent movie might help here); and unless you know your English kings from Richard II to Richard III (with all the Henrys in the middle), the football game with a crown as ball will have little meaning. ( I thought the line about cutting Henry VI into three parts was the best in this sketch.)
  Possibly the bit that calls for the audience's greatest degree of  knowledge and concentration is the resume of a plot that combines all the Shakespearean comedies into a single play (with a very long title). There are plenty of in-jokes and bad puns throughout Act I to demand your fullest attention--and again, few of them work if you do not know the originals.
  The first act ends with a little situation in which one of the troupe refuses to do ""Hamlet"" and flees from the theater. When Act II begins, he has not been brought back and the remaining actor must fill the time with Monty Python-like bad routines. Once back on track, the audience is enlisted to help one of their number (I assume she is not a plant) ""feel"" the part of Ophelia. The trio's versatility is put to the test at the very end when they repeat the entire Hamlet production quickly, then very quickly, and finally very quickly and backwards!
  So all in all, this is a joyous romp for those ""in the know"" and one that might seem pretty pointless for those who have avoided Shakespeare once school was over. Therefore I must give it 4 stars out of 5 in general, although it deserves 5-plus for those who have stuck with the iambics all these years.
  A perfect gift for your English teacher, by the way. Unless you are an English teacher, in which case buy one for yourself.",992822400,88,2291,4.574572127139365

1620554,4,B00005LB8B,"Advertised as vaudeville for intellectuals, this 2001 performance in Vancouver is long on some very brisk vaudeville (and lots of stunts) and a bit short on Shakespeare for this viewer. That being said, our family (our son was Capulet in Romeo and Juliet in High School) had some good laughs.

The physical comedy is intense and fast and it wouldn't surprise me if the RSC trio collapsed backstage after their curtain calls, which were whimsically coerced from a willing audience that was ""all in.""",1464480000,,498,4.928571428571429

Many of his best known works are detailed quickly but not inaccurately in this DVD. It is performed by three men, which based on what they do are obviously very clever men, despite their antics. They encourage audience participation which I think is engaging.

I felt like part of the audience in a small intimate theatre, which has never happened to me watching a movie.  I really like theatre and Shakespeare, but am not obsessed.  I would actually have like more story and plot and subtlety.  My favorite movie of all time is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.  This is nothing like it.  This seems like a bunch of college kids messing around.  It is goofy and clever and made me laugh out loud.  The filming was very good.  The actors captured the attention of the audience and the audience functioned as a collective essential part of the play and movie.  It isn't great.

1620622,5,B00005LB8B,"My wife, daughter, and I truly enjoyed watching this DVD.  I never heard of these guys or their work before, but was truly astounded at how good it was.

Briefly (and not to bore those who have read the other numerous reviews), the trio do quick Shakespeare, condensing his works into very quick, silly skits.  ""Hamlet"" at the end is the longest of them, and other well-known works (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Macbeth"" being most notable) are just as funny.  I was confused by the numerous ""Shakespeare comedies"" compiled into one maddening one, with quick-paced dialogue, editing from each actor's face.  I only caught 4 of them, just because I know them.  Unfortunately, I am not all that immersed in the lesser Shakespeare works, but neither were the children in the audience to whom they performed.

It didn't matter, though.  This is good stuff.  As a fan of ""Rosecranz and Guilderstern are Dead,"" I found the acting and dialogue absolutely brilliant, and the DVD certainly needs to be viewed many times to catch some of the crazy lines.

""Othello"" to rap, calling Hamlet ""Omelet, the Cheese Danish"" and doing the skit quickly backwards, and the great audience interaction with the ""Hamlet"" skit were all high points (if the rest of the show wasn't).

It's great for children, and truly full of talent.

4 1/2 of 5.  I thought the break before the ""Hamlet"" skit was a bit out of place, but the DVD edited the break out.  Must see, in my opinion.

I will be updating in future.  I need to watch the ""Extra Features"" on the DVD.",1357862400,,1528,4.645522388059701

IF you know a bit about Shakespeare this is really a great watch because the more you know about Shakespeare and his plays the more references you'll get. That said, my little brother who is NOT fond of Shakespeare (he thinks the language is too hard to understand) likes this almost as much as I do.

Other people who are looking for a post modern, irreverant take on Shakey have jumped on board as well.  Here's the problem: the script may be brilliantly constructed by guys who are too smart for their own good, but they're not good enough to pull off the concept well. Shakespeare wrote some very entertaining plays, not all of them, but some of them.  He wrote excellent tragedy, history, and of course comedy (in both the classical, and modern version).  If you're doing a play with the name in the title, you'd better bring the goods and be as entertaining as a good version of one of his plays.  These guys can't even do it while at least referencing all of them.  Maybe that's the problem with the concept, the bad plays take away the attention from the good ones.  If only they'd gone the princess bride route of only including the best parts then the piece would've been better.  By the way, I don't view Shakespeare as sacred territory, I just think these guys aren't that funny or talented.  A low quality high school/community theatre could do a better version of this.",1344816000,2,1252,4.528888888888889

That being said, this play is hilarious.  I watched it multiple times, and it's still so funny!  I watched it with my entire family and we were almost peeing our pants with laughter.  In the words of the authors, this is not ""dry, boring, vomitless Shakespeare!""

I have to admit it also helps that I have read the play too, the footnotes in the written version of the play are obviously not acted out, and they too are riotously hilarious!  I highly recommend reading the play too!  If you love this DVD, you'll love reading the play too!

As is the case with many live performances, I think especially with comedy, it loses a little something when brought to the small screen. without a theatre full of people to laugh along with, it just doesn't seem quite as funny. That is not to say it isn't worthwhile, thus the 4 stars I gave it. Those who know a little about Shakespeare will probably find it funnier than those who do not. They do spend a lot of time on the better known plays: Romeo and Juliet, MacBeth, and Hamlet, so most viewers will know at least some of the material. They occasionally go into madcap, slapstick type moments, which will probably be funny to about anyone, but they also go painfully close to being silly at times. I felt the rendition of Hamlet was a bit long, and the audience participation is better if you are in the live audience. On balance, though, compared to a lot of the absolute drivel in theatres these days, this is probably worth the expense of viewing.

They kick, they run, they sing, and engage their live audience throughout the 1 and a half hours. This video made some of Shakespeare's works more accessible for me, and encouraged me to think of his literature with a new perspective.

For those of you that don't like Shakespeare, you could use this parody to make fun of his literature. For those of you who ARE Shakespeare fans, you will most likely not be offended by the video, and you'll enjoy it for its lightheartedness anyway. The material is not rated, but I would say it's PG-13 because of mild suggestive humor. For instance, a few times it is implied they are about to say a bad word, but then they don't say it.

Yet still, in the end, I think these guys show a love and appreciation for the plays.
Someone did already comment (and I'd like to agree) that a general knowledge of Shakespeare's plays is helpful while watching this.

Unsure about it's content, I bought it used, both my wife and I were laughing uncontrollable. Caution: keep the pause button at a fingers length because you will need to use it frequently to allow your own laughter to subside. Otherwise you will miss some of the very fast paced gags and dialogue that never seem to slow down for laughing periods.

Being review #100, and the first review of 2010, for a DVD that was released seven years ago seems frivolous. But this comedy team, it's content, and she sheer delight of comedy entertainment, regardless of your academic knowledge of Shakespeare, demands a review...6 stars if it were allowed.  And it's impossible to pick out a segment or a point in the production to call the pinnacle of it's comedy.  It is 88 minutes of continual amusement at the expense of a sacrilege abridgment of The complete Works of William S.  The acting and antics of Adam Long, Reed Martin, & Austin Tichenor, clowns all, are in themselves worthy of the experience even if your inexperience with Shakespeare allow none of the subtle bits connected with the bards writing. Props rival those of Gallagher and his ""sledge-o-matic."" Audience interaction is as funny as the stage production.  Costumes add to the humor.  The 3 brilliant players occasional tickle their own funny bones similar to the self-amusement of Red Skelton.

Also be ready with the reverse on the remote. In ""Hamlet"" the side-splitting is so fast you'll find yourself backing up to catch all the humor, all the dialogue, all the antics, & all the Shakespearean abuse.  SUBTITLES and/or CC help in catching all of the super fast ridiculous take on Shakespeare. And when it's all over, and your breath recovers (and those side aches from laughing) there's plenty of special features.  The DVD case warning says it all: ""High-speed hilarity. Not for people with weak hearts or English degrees!"" It just takes a willingness to laugh till it hurts.

Highly recommended. The last time I wanted to award 6 stars was not for comedy, but for a British Drama/Mystery/Historical DVD set called: Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day.",1262736000,,2249,4.910290237467018

Bear in mind, I still do not know much about Shakespeare and his plays, I imagine that this would be nonstop laughs for an English teacher.

I only have one minor complaint about the whole show. I thought that the scene in hamlet, where they get the crowd involved, was slightly drawn out. It is wonderful that they have so much crowd involvement, but that scene just never seemed to end. Fortunately, it did end, and the play resumed.

Caution: you may never be able to read Shakespeare with a straight face after watching this DVD :)  If you know the plays, you'll have to watch it multiple times to process all of the inside jokes.",1215043200,,452,4.6125

Filmed on stage before a live audience, the play holds true to the early production I saw.  Audience participation is still fun to watch on the video, although I recommend getting your television viewing audience involved if possible.  It truly gives a good overview of Shakespeare's art and makes it more accessible to someone who is intimidated by his plays.  Just viewing the Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet sections of it makes the low price even more worthwhile.",1213315200,,563,4.714285714285714

It's done on a TV soundstage with a small audience, and it loses something in the controlled environment.  For example, in live shows they poke fun mercilessly at people who arrive late.  None of that here.  Generally their improv and audience-participation humor is still there, but you have to wonder how spontaneous it really was in this case.

Another oddity:  It was filmed in Vancouver, but at points they maintain the pretense that they're doing their London show (one explicit dialogue reference to being in London, and an passing comment that for a London audience they've got a lot of Americans).  Again, makes it seem a bit fake.

So:  Not a substitute for a true live performance, but their Reduced Shakespeare is good material, and this is a perfectly servicable performance of it.",1207526400,,878,4.878378378378378
1620671,4,B00005LB8B,"The Reduced Shakespeare Company's The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged) is ninety minutes of the most fun you'll ever have with Shakespeare. Whether you're new to the Bard, an old fan, or even if you hate him, you're sure to find this production witty, delightful and hilarious.

The Reduced Shakespeare Company's live stage production of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged) has been making the rounds in North America and Britain for years, imprinting its unique brand of comedy on Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. The three man comedy troupe has also performed on both British and American television and National Public Radio. At one point, they even had a long-time place in London's famous West End. Now that the production is available on DVD, there is no reason to miss the opportunity to see all of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets hilariously condensed into one crazy show. There is even the complete script available, if you prefer to get your laughs from print.

Don't understand Othello? Might it make more sense to you if it's presented as a rap?  How about Hamlet re-enacted with sock puppets? And just to make sure you get it, it's also performed backwards. Titus Andronicus is quite possibly the most interesting cooking show you will ever see. And these are just the tragedies. As far as the histories go, they are presented as a football game, just in case you can't tell the English kings apart from each other. Don't think the audience doesn't get in on the act, because audience participation is also a big part of the show.

Having some knowledge of Shakespeare might be better in order to appreciate the lengths that this comedy trio has to go to in order give you the gist of Shakespeare's plays. On the DVD production, Adam Long, Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor go through on-stage sex changes, several costume changes, and a lot of improvisation in order to bring the brilliance and humor of Shakespeare's works to life (and yes, as this production proves, there is humor in Shakespeare's tragedies). Even if you're a Shakespeare novice, the slapstick comedy and crazy antics are sure to make you laugh.",1204243200,,2160,4.925824175824176
1620672,5,B00005LB8B,"Which is incredible since I was their original stage manager all those years ago in the woods of Northern California. The show is very popular still with young people here including my 17 year old daughter who often has to watch it after I have left the house since after all I have already seen the show a hundred times. It still gets me, Adam Long is still one of the funniest guys ever, and twice as smart as when he was speech and debate champion of the SF Valley when I first met him.

He lives in London now, and owns a theatre and has Kids and a great wife and the show has been updated with some fresh parts and in general this is a great DVD. It will make your kids laugh while they get familiar with the Bard.",1201651200,,719,4.063380281690141
1620673,5,B00005LB8B,"I really like Shakespeare, but even if I didn't, I'd love the RSC (no, not the Royal Shakespeare Company ... though they're pretty good, too). Funny and irreverent but also occasionally serious and thoughtful, these three actors treat Shakespeare exactly as he deserves to be treated: The greatest English-speaking playwright who also just happened to be the father (or, at least, stepfather) of formula writing.

These guys know their stuff, and they show it live, on stage, to an audience of folks who may or may not love (or even KNOW) Shakespeare, and they pull it off with energy and vision. This is, by far, the best of the RSC's productions (they've done The Bible, Hollywood, The Complete History of America, and others). I'm convinced it's because of the material they had to work with (yeah, Shakespeare's works are generally better-written than the Bible and they tend to make more sense than most American history).

I highly recommend this to anyone, whether they like Shakespeare or not. By the time you stop watching, you WILL appreciate Shakespeare. And, if you're lucky enough to see this while studying the Bard ... well, you'll have a hard time not footnoting the RSC on your final paper.",1198886400,,1207,4.911764705882353

1620675,4,B00005LB8B,"Do you know that it is possible to see all 37 plays of the playwright who is considered by many as the greatest ever lived in the show that is under two hours? I did not - until yesterday when I saw The ""Reduced Shakespeare Company - The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)"" slapstick show that actually compresses all bard's plays in the 90 minutes of wild ride and pure hilarity. Three members of The Reduced Shakespeare Company Adam Long, Reed Martin, and Austin Tichenor act, comment, sing, and not only entertain their theatric audiences but also make them participate in the most hilarious production of ""Hamlet"" I ever seen. If you never read or seen any stage or screen adaptations of a Shakespeare's play, you still will enjoy the show thanks to the great timing, perfect communication among three performers, and unorthodox but always hysterical way to present each of the celebrated works by the most revered author. As it was the case in the 16th Century's theater, where the male actors play the female heroines, Adam Long plays tragic characters Gertrude, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Ophelia and he is incredibly funny yet strangely sympathetic as the unfortunate ladies. Long, Tichenor who plays always serious scholar and Martin, the clown, acrobat, musician and illusionist of the show all complete one another beautifully. Adam Long and Reed Martin together wrote the script to the show, and found some very original and enjoyable ideas on how to present the plays, all 37 of them in such short period of time. I liked Titus Andronicus Cooking Horror Show. I had a lot of fun listening to and watching ""Othello"" as a rap song:

""Here's the story of a brother by the name of Othello.
He liked white women, and he liked... green... Jell-O.
Hey, yeah! And a punk named Iago, made himself a menace because
He didn't like Othello, the moor of Venice!""

I absolutely adore the idea of condensing all 17 the comedies in one long sentence that was made up of all the titles to leave more times for the tragedies (because I agree with Adam, Reed, and Austin that Shakespeare's tragedies are funnier).

After enjoying so much ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)"", I am ready for the others Reduced Shakespeare Company's projects, ""The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)"", ""The Complete History of America (abridged)"", ""Western Civilization: The Complete Musical (abridged)"", ""All The Great Books (abridged)"" , and ""Completely Hollywood (abridged)"".",1198195200,,2490,4.995180722891567

Everything I read suggested that it would facilitate readers' basic comprehension of Shakespeare's texts.  Upon watching it, I was disappointed to find that most of the plays were really only given passing mention.  While I realize that it would be virtually impossible to accurately present all of the plays (let alone the sonnets) in one performance, I had hoped that each would be encapsulated, however briefly.  Instead, the players simply summed up most of the plays in groups (the histories, the comedies, etc.), with such extreme brevity that watching will neither build appreciation for nor understanding of Shakespeare's lesser known works.  The renditions of Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet are the best segments on the video.  I will use those with my students.",1192579200,2,891,5.152777777777778

Best of all, this DVD's performance features the writers of the play.

Bonus features include a home video of the very first performance of the play, under a park shelter in Canada.  Once you're familliar with the show, watch this feature to see how the show has evolved.  The earlier version will also make you laugh.",1178409600,2,570,4.549019607843137

She promptly claimed it, and while she was watching it in turn, her younger brother came in because she was laughing so hard.  He was next to succumb to the hilarity of Reduced Shakespeare.

As another reviewer mentioned, you will fully appreciate this if you know and love the Bard.  The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs all of Shakespeare's works, including the sonnets, in about 90 minutes.  Well, they don't actually perform the sonnets, but they make an appearance, and were I to further comment on that, you would not enjoy it as much!

Their Othello rap is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  They also reduce, rereduce and rerereduce all Shakespeare's comedies to one sentence, then perform them all simultaneously.  (That may not appear to make sense, but trust me, it works!)

If you are a fan of Shakespeare, and seeking comedic fare above the average available on DVD, you owe it to yourself and your family to get this DVD.  Whether you see it once or a dozen times, it is guaranteed to get you laughing uncontrollably (seriously, drink beverages while watching this at your own risk!).  Not appropriate for very small children, teens and up will really have fun.  In fact, showing it to your teenagers may get a whole new generation hooked on the Bard!

1620681,5,B00005LB8B,"I first encountered this grandly amusing entertainment as a live production at my university campus some years ago.  My son and I decided to to go based solely on the play's title, and a winking characature of Shakespeare displayed on the poster. Little did we know what that wink signified, as we had no idea of the lunacy that was in store for us.  When ""The Reduced Shakespeare Company"" came available on VHS (then, later, DVD), I purchased it, and have been enjoying and sharing it ever since.

As a secondary English teacher, I have difficulty sometimes getting my students to embrace the classics.  When I mention Shakespeare, eyes roll, heads fall onto desks, and moans can be heard.  It's like getting a small child to eat his vegetables.  Like broccoli, the classics are good for us, but they're hard for some to digest.

Enter the Reduced Shakespeare Company with its ""The Complete Works of ""William Shakespeare (Abridged).""  I have used excerpts in class to show the kids that Shakespeare can be a lot of fun.  With their more-or-less complete versions of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Hamlet,"" even my most resistant students know the major plot points and themes of these plays.

The overview of the other plays is inspired, lumping the main ideas of Shakespeare's comedies into one tossed-salad.  The histories are also compressed in a manner that only Americans could have devised.

And, one can never view ""Othello"" in quite the same way after hearing the ""Reduced Shakesperians"" rendition of ""Othello Rap.""

This performance is much more (or less) than a teaching tool.  It is a rollicking, comedic fun time for all.  If you like Shakespeare already, you'll like the witty satire going on here.  If you like the Three Stooges, the slapstick is right up your alley.  If you have a short attention span, don't worry.  One can view this performance as a whole, or pick out bits one finds amusing.

I have viewed ""The Complete Works"" several times now, both with my family and with my students, and each time I find a new joke, or even a new insight, that I missed earlier.

Some have suggested that Shakespeare is perhaps rolling in his grave at this treatment of his plays.  I like to believe, however, that if he were alive today, Will would be laughing--all the way to the bank.",1173571200,5,2289,4.744303797468355

It is a straight video recording of a live performance.  3 stand-up comedy guys make a spoof of Shakespeare plays...

Well, I've seen couple of original Willy's plays and they were funnier without being obnoxious. The joke about willy made me laugh, though!

The guy who usually got the female roles in the ""reduced"" used vomiting to amuse the audience, but after 8 or 9 occassions he did it the joke got REALLY stale.

Mostly physical comedy like kicking in the balls, vulgar gestures, and otherwise monkeying around substituted for real comedy.

Yes, we were laughing, but because it was so ridiculous. (I try to avoid word ""stupid"" in reviews, but it really described the whole thing well).

If you are into silliness and really crude humour, you will have a great time.

But I promptly put the DVD up for sale - I don't want my 18 dollars completely wasted.  I have a great collection of movies, but this one won't have a place on my shelf.

Thank god her parents were not at home because we would have probably annoyed them with the amount of times we laughed at the antics of Adam, Reed and Austin.  Their performance was an absolute hoot!  The play condences Shakespeare's 37 plays and 152 sonnets into one 90 minute comedy riot.  The performance contains lots of hilarious slap-stick comedy and one-liners in a laugh-fest that would set the greatest of comedy genius' rolling in the aisles.

What can you look forward to?  All 16 of Shakespeare's comedies are combined into one play called (among other things) ""Four Weddings and a Transvestite"" and all of his histories are made into a football game with the performers running all over stage ""killing"" each other and throwing a crown around with running commentary.  ""Romeo and Juliet"" is done in a 15 minute run of slap-stick with Austin narrating and Reed and Adam performing all the parts.  ""Titus Androgenus"" is done as a cooking show and ""Othello"" turns into a rap.  Act Two of the show is devoted to ""Hamlet"", with an audience member playing Ophelia.  They also do two fast versions and a backwards version as an encore.

1620705,5,B00005LB8B,"At the time I am writing this review, I am a college junior pursuing an English major.  I was introduced to this comedic troupe completely by accident when I heard explosions of laughter coming from my next-door neighbors dorm room.  I wandered over to see what was so funny at 2:00 am and walked into a sight that I still laugh at to this day.

Four of my best friends were sprawled around the room laughing their heads off at something on the TV.  I glanced over to see what they were looking at, and found them watching the ""Hamlet"" portion of this DVD.  I sat down to watch it with them, and even though I had no clue what was going on, and had just been woken up, even I was forced into hiliarity by this performance.

The next day I returned to their room (soda in hand)

and watched it again with them from the beginning, laughing so hard that at one point I actually spat out a mouthful of Diet Coke all over the carpet when they pulled a particularly funny joke. Since then I have been a fan and have watched this movie more times than I can count, and I now own my own copy.

You do not have to know Shakespeare to understand this show.  The three actors (Reed, Austin, and Adam) take you on a rip-roaring, side-tickling, laugh-out-loud adventure into Shakespeare's work in only 90 minutes, and it doesn't even seem that long while watching the show, because you are so easily distracted by the slapstick humor and complete and utter lunacy of this show.

What I do find interesting is the attempt at the beginning of the show to put on an air of seriousness and thus throw off the thought that this is a comedy.  Austin gets up on stage and does a five minute ramble on ""stepping into the future"" and ""placing a copy of the Complete Works into every hotel room in the world"".  Adam does a remarkably funny spiel about Shakespeare's life, badly confusing it with Adolf Hitler, which is the first indication of this crazy ride.

From a condensed version of ""Romeo and Juliet"", to ""Othello"" performed as a rap, to all of the histories in one fell swoop as a football game, this three men are talented at keeping you off-balance and laughing the entire way.

I highly recommend that anyone even looking at these reviews invest the money and buy a copy of this DVD or VHS.  You will not be disappointed!  However, I also suggest that you do not eat or drink while watching this production, unless you (inevitably) wish to find yourself cleaning up spilled food and drink at the end, as I did when I first saw this movie.",1104969600,3,2526,4.376873661670236

I first stumbled across the Reduced Shakespeare Company on a business trip in London, and have seen all three of their shows (Shakespeare, US History, Bible) on various UK trips, some more than once.  If you like this DVD (and you very probably will), please consider seeing the live performance at the Criterion Theatre in London, or on tour in various US and UK cities!",1104451200,,512,4.494623655913978

Although this DVD could be humorous to anyone, it does help if you have read the plays before watching this. The humor is slapstick, but intelligently so most of the time, and since the slapstick is only a small part of the hilarious interpretations of Shakespeare's plays, it is also forgivable.

So, 3 of the 5 of us didn't know Shakespeare from Uncle Sam - but we laughed until we cried.  By the 2nd viewing, everyone was shouting out her favorite lines.  OOB! OOB!  The first half is a lightning attack on ""all of the plays, including the sonnets.""  The second half (oh dear) they realize there's still one play to go: Hamlet.  They enact it several times, becoming more & more manic, & culminating with ""Ladies & Gentlemen, Hamlet backwards.""

My mother in-law, a great grandmother twice over, laughed so hard she almost needed medical attention. The next day, she would see things that reminded her of scenes and would laugh all over again. My teenage boys also found this to be hilarious and wanted to see it more than once. Definitely a DVD for the whole family...I'm not a fan of the ""Titus"" scene-humor about cut off hands isn't my bag-but it was in the play... I liked the Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet parts, especially since they were required reading in school. The only drawback is that you laugh so long at each joke you miss the next line. You should definitely own this one so you can catch the parts you missed first go around.",1072569600,4,880,4.307228915662651

Hamlet I finally understood, Julius Caesar has finally been condensed, Titus Andronicus was finally gory, and the lineages and thrown passing were all made very clear.

Adam Long is constantly running around as the girl in all of the plays, flashing the audience by flipping up his skirt, and whenever his character is supposed to die, he pretends to get sick. their was alot of common language and slang to help a veiwer who might not be much of a shakespear enthusiest understand exactly what was going on with the plots and understanding the jokes. over all Reed, Adam, and Austin make a great team and really appear to be having great fun while entertaining their audience.",1068163200,,603,4.69811320754717
1620716,5,B00005LB8B,"I was introduced to the Reduced Shakespeare Company when I was cast in a production of ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [Abridged]"" in college. The play was the funniest thing I'd ever done -- I pulled a muscle when I first read the script simply from laughing too hard -- and I've been a huge fan of theirs ever since.
Finally, their premiere production is available on DVD! This video of a production starring Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor and Adam Long is as funny as the script was the first time I read it. I was unusual, after having been in the play myself, to see how some of the originators actually envisioned the scenes, as well as how the scenes had evolved in the years since the play was first published -- the Titus Andronicus cooking show, for instance, went from a cross-dressing gag to an Emeril parody. It was still hysterically funny.
The DVD also has a surprising amount of special features, including a video of the complete ""Romeo and Juliet"" segment from the first ever production of the show, starring Adam Long, Jess Winfield and Daniel Singer. (It's also interesting to note how THAT scene evolved from the first production until the date of publication.)
If you're an RSC fan, this is a great DVD. If you've never seen one of their shows before, watch this DVD -- you'll become a fan.",1068163200,29,1321,4.601694915254237
1620717,4,B00005LB8B,"Forget for a moment, if you can (given the title), that this is about Shakespeare.  Think of it, rather, as a traveling troup of players who have come to your town simply to entertain you for 90 minutes (plus intermission).  If you know some, or even all of Shakespear's plays, all the better.  The jokes will probably mean more to you.  Otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the antics of this extraordianary group of actors.  The show actually reminded me of WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY?, especially when they get the audience activally involved, evening bringing two people on stage to interact.  I was exhausted by the end of the DVD, simply because the actors seemed exhausted.  And they should be.  This is a physical presentation, not a cerebrial one.  It gets a little bawdy at times (and is not recommeded for small children, although there were some children in the audience).  Also, I take it that this is a Canadian company, not the original British cast, so some of the British-brittle humor probably has been reworked.  My 24 year old son and I (we're both actors and writers) howled at the show, getting most of the Shakespearian's jokes, but generally just relishing in the wonderful, wild antics of this broad, burlesque-style enterprise.",1063411200,,1248,4.812206572769953
1620718,4,B00005LB8B,"The Reduced Shakespeare Company presents a production of Shakespeare's works without making you sit through each minute detail of each play. This production is about 90 minutes long and presents Shakespeare's plays in slapstick, silly way that is fun.
The title of this being complete is a bit misleading. The players mainly take on Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet, with quick productions of Othello (a hilarious rap) and Titus Andronicus (Cooking With Titus). In this respect, those who purchase this should know that many of the other plays are grouped together in bulk segments (they lump all the comedies into one skit) and that these are comedic interpretations of the plays and not summaries.
It is understandable because this was improvisation, but the ""I don't want to do Hamlet"" joke, with one of the actors, was a little long. The joke could have been carried out for a few minutes, but they went a little on for quite a while. Also, the Ophelia ""madness"" part went far too long as well, although the way they were able to get the audience involved was great.
The other aspects of this video were exceptional as well. There was really never a dull moment, mainly because they had to keep the action moving quickly to get through everything, but also because the players had a knack for making even the most remote instance or mess up funny. Also, this video is a resourceful production for many different people-the Shakespeare fan and the Reluctant Shakespeare fan. Because the interpretations are brief and comical, it is really not imperative to know all the Shakespeare plays. If you do know Shakespeare, you can catch the other jokes within the mini-plays (like the cursed MacBeth scene).
Another effective aspect of this film is the actor's ability to make something ""dry"" seem fun and entertaining. And this does hold a small amount of educational value for the simple fact that it is a resource that will build interest in learning Shakespeare plays. (However, you should be forewarned that there are a few scenes that are suggestive and a bit of bad language).
In addition to the Hamlet production, which encompasses about 30-40 minutes of the play, there are several hilarious encore versions of Hamlet, two super-quick versions and a ""backwards"" version as well. This is great video to watch if you want a little Shakespeare humor.",1059523200,,2348,4.902010050251256

1620720,4,B00005LB8B,"Although Shakespeare is probably turning over in his grave at every performance, even he has to laugh at this hysterical troop of American and Canadian comedians. I had the fortunate opportunity to see them twice at the Criterion Theater, Picadilly Circus, London, and once in Southampton, England. Of the three different shows--The Complete Works of Shakespeare, The Complete Word of God, and The Complete History of America (all abridged, of course)--the Shakespeare routine was the cherry on top of the icing on the cake. The writing, the performances, the audience interaction (no plants allowed), and the sheer pace of the show is truly unique and begs to be seen time and again. If you ever have the opportunity to see the Reduced Shakespeare Company live, then drop everything and run to the venue. Until then, this DVD will prepare you for the funniest night of your life.

In adapting the piece to the TV screen, the director (Paul Kafno, I name names!) has gone berserk! Incessantly cutting to the audience reacting to the jokes, instead of allowing US to react; cutting to close-ups when it is vital to the joke that we see the full stage; a positive genius for having the camera in the wrong place at the wrong time; and at least half a dozen (based on audience reaction) jokes we don't get to see because the camera is showing the afore-mentioned reactions; all serve to undercut what could have been a perfect gem",1052265600,19,686,4.540322580645161

This play does not ask much of the viewer, you don't need to like Shakespeare to watch this DVD, and frankly if you hate him, even better. It can *help* to be familiar with the stories, but if you're not you'll have no problem catching up and will be laughing along very quickly. You will quickly find yourself laughing at the jokes in the play (it often seems pretty hard not to).
The only fault I have with the DVD is that the extra scene is just a really old performance of Romeo and Juliet, I guess I was expecting more, but it was still worth every penny.
