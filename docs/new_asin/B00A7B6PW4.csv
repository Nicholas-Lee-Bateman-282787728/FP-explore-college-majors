8547747,5,B00A7B6PW4,"In the same vein as other ""Sipping Jetstreams"" productions, focus is on the locale and host culture with mellow music. This movie follows the exploits of two like minded surfers in Dave Rastovich and Craig Anderson who have a deep connection to the art of surfing. They travel to numerous locations and surf in most and this movie chronicles them chasing one swell around the world. Great movie if looking for a mellow surf movie focusing on culture, travel and a visual representation of the deeper sense of life and surfing. Not a choppy edited punk rock or modern collective type movie, surfing is still A+!",1491264000,,610,4.764150943396227

8547749,4,B00A7B6PW4,"Incredible. It was one more success from Taylor Steele and Sipping Jetstreams.
The hurry of the movie filming and the compromise to follow the swell made it a dificult challange and so the movie is very good but is not so good as Castles in The Sky and Sipping Jetstreams, the best surf movies ever. This two surf movies changed my expectations about a surf movie so nowadays is difficult to go over it and rank another movie as a perfect one.",1367798400,,443,4.414634146341464
8547750,4,B00A7B6PW4,"Gnarly? Yep. Radical? Totally. Sickness? For Shirley. After watching this DVD, I cast all of my worldly possessions asunder and whittled down my wardrobe to simple loincloth. The type of loin-wear that perhaps the legendary Rudyard Kipling character, Mowgli, might don whilst a'frolicking with the bonobos or tamarins of the shaded forest glen.",1361836800,,344,5.509433962264151
