3102921,3,B0013D8L6I,"Despite having his name over the title, this is not Jack London's Call of the Wild. This is a completely original story about a young man named Miles Challenger--not a character in the original book.  The script incorporates characters and incidents from the book, but the story is totally different.  However, taken on its own merits, the film is entertaining.  Miles is a character young people can relate to, and the film does offer an interesting look at life up north during the Alaska gold rush.  Just don't expect Jack London's story, or you will be disappointed.",1211673600,16,570,4.845360824742268
3102922,2,B0013D8L6I,"I wanted to like this movie. I expected to like this movie. But I was disappointed by Call of the Wild.

What Left Me Cold?

The film never drew me in. Most of the actors were clearly acting (and not too well at that) rather than becoming part of a compelling story. Character development was so thin that I never cared much what happened.

While the scenery and photography were stunning, the editing was poor, and the black screen breaks between scenes distracting. Makeup was obvious, such that I saw makeup rather than seeing the ravages of cold.

The relationship between boy and dog was never fully developed. It was there, but emotionless, almost sterile.

Overall, I found the movie flat. I enjoyed the scenery but missed the pull of the original story.

Five stars for photography, one star for editing, one star for story.  Average: Two stars.",1211587200,6,853,4.722972972972973
3102923,4,B0013D8L6I,"While most versions of Call of the Wild focus on the people (and the big name actors who portray them) in Buck's life rather than Buck, this animated rendition does a decent job of telling the story. The animation is fair, with noticable repititions, and is done in a more 'Japanese anime' style than anything else. This film gets points for acurate descriptions of the people and dogs, and is one of the only ones to show Spitz, the rival lead dog, as he is portrayd in the book (""a big, snow white fellow from Spitzbergen"").
 Buck is described as ""a blend of German shepherd and Saint Bernard"" but he looks like a regular GSD. This version also gives screen time to Buck's team mates, Billy and Joe, Dave, Sol Leks and the others, plus the only adaptaion I've ever seen to show Thornton's other two dogs, Skeet and Nig.
 Even though it's not the most spectacular film, it's certainly worth a look if you are a sled dog fan or a Jack London buff. Note: The animated dogs on the cover of the DVD look nothing like the actual charecters in the movie. This was originally released on VHS, by Toei Animation.",1204761600,,1105,4.438423645320197

8249807,5,B0013D8L6I,Call of the Wild: I was impressed with the dog he was so big and husky. Perfect for the part. Good wholesome movie.,1475107200,,115,4.043478260869565
8249808,2,B0013D8L6I,It was not according to the book.,1428710400,,33,3.857142857142857
8249809,4,B0013D8L6I,Love Jack London stuff. My older daycare kids enjoy this. Nice for learning some American literature.  Good family movie. Definitely recommend.,1376438400,,143,5.809523809523809
8249810,5,B0013D8L6I,It is a real good movie plus there is CALL OF THE WILD 2 with me I got my hands on number2 and watch it and like it as well In my case watch 2 but I like the number 1 as well,1365984000,,174,3.0697674418604652
8249811,5,B0013D8L6I,"With all the things that happen the world, it's nice to sit back and watch something that is easy to digest, and takes us back to a simple time.
It may not be ""Exactly like Jack London's version"" but it was still worth watching for me and my family.
Everyone is a critic now a days, just enjoy a story for what it is, and how it plays out.
I'm 42 and I couldn't wait to get into the next episode! It is worth the time to sit with the family and talk about what went on then.
It's a good time to open talk with the kids and talk about our history, life, and death.
You won't be able to do that over sex in the city, simpsons, or Icarlie now a days.",1296777600,,647,3.8358208955223883
8249812,5,B0013D8L6I,"Jack London certainly knows how to write a book with heart felt love and loyalty. Now to see it as a movie, what outstanding viewing this was. Get the tissues.",1286496000,,159,4.333333333333333
8249813,5,B0013D8L6I,"This movie was part of a thirteen episode TV series that aired on Animal Planet in 2000. I think this movie was episode 1 in the series. I have only been able to find two of these on DVD, the other being #5. I would like to find the rest.",1265328000,,238,3.78
8249814,5,B0013D8L6I,Great Story. Love the dog. Family loved it,1264982400,,42,4.375
8249815,1,B0013D8L6I,"The menus on the DVD barely work.  You usually can't see what's selected, so you have to guess by pressing twice to the right or whatever.

Also, it's not close captioned or subtitled for the hearing impaired, even though the produce information says it is.",1220659200,,257,4.688888888888889
8249816,1,B0013D8L6I,"In case the other two reviews don't convince you, this has almost nothing to do with Jack London's story.  I was thinking as I watched it, ""At least they took out the violence so young children can watch it"" but then there's the scene with the frozen stiff man, and the drowning in the frozen water scene was pretty bad for little ones, too.  Not to mention all the dogs dying left and right.

Don't waste your time.",1211846400,17,416,4.3076923076923075
