1389238,3,B0000524FF,"I used to love this show! It was an early 70's slice of typical Gerry Anderson optimism for safe nuclear power (NOT an impossiblity) and unlimited funding for spaceflight (DEFINITELY an impossibility these days). The show had special effects that still look good today and a handful of first season episodes had a decent stab at creating some promising metaphysical space opera. OF COURSE you have to make allowances for the costuming and hairstyles. That is a given. It was the 1970's for goodness sake! The acting of the principals has sometimes been unfairly criticised. Martin Landau shined on this show only when the scripts were good, which was too infrequently. He gave a performance that was unfavorably compared to the thespian histrionics of Bill Shatner, who people think all Science Fiction leader characters should emulate. Landau's Koenig was a different, sometimes more subtle creation than Kirk. Although Shatner had many more years and opportunities to refine James Tiberius. John Koenig was a leader suffering under almost crushing responsibilty. And Landau occasionally managed to let that show. Space: 1999 had it's high points in it's first season. It later surrendered much of it's quality during an appalling, rubber-suit-monster-of-the-week second season, which I recommend you don't buy. And as for a sublight-speed Moon visiting several star systems through the season? Ummm...",976838400,4,1403,5.381818181818182
1389296,5,B0000524FF,"Scrounging around in old video stores, along with other mom and pop businesses wasn't getting the same results like it used to. So, I finally broke down and bought Space: 1999 Set 2 to complete my collection. Set 2 has some of the most memorable episodes, such as ""Missing Link"" with stars like Peter Cushing, and ""Guardian of Piri"" with Catherine Schell. Plus Set 2 has other moving stories like ""Voyager's Return"". (The first season of Space: 1999 made quite an impression on me, but I never cared much for year 2.)

I've always enjoyed most of Gerry Anderson's shows, and Space: 1999 was the only show on TV at the time that tried to compete with the adventures and concepts shown in the original Star Trek. Yes, the show had its problems, and it had to live in the shadow of Star Trek and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". But it was great to watch on cold Saturday evenings after the original Star Trek reruns were over.

The new DVD's arrived shrink wrapped in a good box with no wear, and no scratches on the disks. The cost was around 10 bucks, the vendor shipped it USPS, and it arrived much sooner than expected. Now the hunt is over:(

But I appreciate it,

1389297,5,B0000524FF,"Space 1999 was a diverse series that had it all and then some. It was fun like Doctor Who, as abstract as the Prisoner, as explorational as Star Trek, as light as Lost In Space, as philosophical as 2001, as dark and claustophobic as the most entertaining horror movies and disaster films, as funny as Plan 9, and it even featured pre-Star Wars space battles that were truly a blast. On it's own merit it was also quite a unique series. It was never locked down into just one pattern so it never got sterile. There are episodes for every mood and mindset. One can enjoy the serious episodes or the just plain fun escapism. The setting of 1999 only adds to the fun and the out of control moon idea was certainly original. Many episodes allow the viewer to come to one's own conclusions and there's little clear continuity after the first episode which also allows creativity on the part of the veiwer. It's a very expansive and wonderous universe that's explored in different ways. The diversity of styles and ideas are it's greatest strength. It's always a wild ride.",1138924800,2,1066,4.5863874345549736
1389298,4,B0000524FF,"Missing Link - I didn't care for this one at all.  Koenig is captured by some aliens that think humans are the ""missing link"" in their evolutionary chain.  There's a whole lot of standing around talking in cheap acid-trip looking sets.  The premise isn't interesting or believable.  The ending is really dumb.

The Guardian of Piri - The moonbase crew goes to the planet Piri and lays around acting really stoned.  Only Koenig seems immune to the powerful LSD trip that affects everyone else.  Kind of like Woodstock if you dressed everyone up in Moonbase uniforms and didn't have any bands playing.  Pretty stupid overall.  The worst part was watching the Moonbase crew having a party before they left Alpha, like a bunch of 9 year olds at a birthday party looking forward to watching the clown show.

Force of Life - A truly excellent episode.  A man who works in one of the reactor rooms is taken over by an alien spirit and starts killing people and consuming Alpha's power.  Some great nightmarish sequences and marvelous sets.  One of my favorites of the whole series.

Alpha Child - Not very good.  Alpha's first child is born and grows up rapidly.  A lot of scenes of the Alphans giddily playing with the kid, rather neauseating.  The ending was somewhat good, but ultimately unsatisfying.

The Last Sunset - Another great episode.  Alpha gets an atmosphere, and Barbara Bain is stranded when her Eagle crashes.  Another of my favorites of the series.

Voyager's Return - I didn't like this one at all.  The Voyager space probe was launched from earth, but something went wrong with it's drive system and it ended up killing a bunch of people.  Now it returns with angry aliens in hot persuit.  The doctor who built it just happens to be on Alpha, but everyone hates him because of the previous accident.  There are a lot of Nazi overtones in this for some reason (the doctor has a heavy German accent and is treated as some sort of horrible criminal).  Doesn't really make sense - do the family memebers of the victims of the space shuttle disasters hate and want to beat up the people who work at NASA?  It was an accident for pete's sake.  Everyone acts very out of character and I found the whole thing rather painful to sit through.

Overall, a real mixed bag.  I give it 4 stars on the strength of the two good episodes, which is being very charitable.",1101254400,3,2366,4.590909090909091
1389299,5,B0000524FF,"Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, responsible for Thunderbirds, turned their attention of using the same principals of their puppet-shows, but use live actors instead of the puppets, and the result was UFO.  Okay the series has some flaws, but die-hard fans loved it.  Their next entry was Space 1999.  Again, maybe not high brow, and some special effects were low brow..lol, but it was still great fun.
This is the second set of episodes of the Earthlings trapped on the moon now travelling through space due to an accident.  With the Oscar winning Martin Landau and this then wife, Barbara Bain, heading the cast they were well acted and rather nifty tales.
This set has Missing Link, where Landau is captured on planet Zenno, where humans appear to the be missing link; The Guardian of Piri, another planet where the Alphans try to land, but run into the Guardian, and once you gaze into its lights you are lost.  Force of Life, (starring the wonderful Ian McShane) as a technician that is invaded by a heat-seeking life form;  Alpha Child - the first child is born on Alpha Moonbase, but soon the joy turns to fear as the child shows strange powers; The Last Sunset - Suddenly the Moon has atmosphere...but how did this happen?; Voyager's Return.  A space probe launched from Earth to acquire information comes back to moonbase with terrible repercussions.
So pop a bunch of popcorn and have a fun evening!",1070928000,2,1403,4.748971193415638
1389300,5,B0000524FF,"In this set are some of the most complex and chilling episodes of the series.  One of my favorites is the ""Force of Life"" episode, because it is so heavy on concept and doesn't rely on the gratuitous actions sequences that would come to be the norm in the second season.  ""Guardian of Piri"" asks and answers the age old question, wherein lies the ideal life?  ""Missing Link""  features an excellent performance by Peter Cushing and examines the extremes of human nature-can these extremes be bridged somehow?  The second disc contains more action oriented episodes.  ""Alpha Child"" concerns and outside menace brought onto Moonbase Alpha.  ""The Last Sunset"" transforms the moon into a breathable planet.  ""Voyager's Return"" is a fable about the hubris that often goes with the quest for knowledge, and the consequences that must be paid when you allow that quest to become unstoppable.  These are all very solid episodes from a series that should've been so much greater than it ended up being.",1055462400,,992,4.927710843373494
1389301,5,B0000524FF,"This is the second in the Space:1999 series of episodes. The next six are just as good. I loved the first season with Barry Morse and the original cast.

1389302,5,B0000524FF,"The costumes, the special effects, the models, the music, and the actors all brought together to form a unique series that touched many a fan. The episodes of Space:1999 were thought provoking, and yes not every little thing was explained, but the series made you THINK!...instead of having every episode resolved, ala Trek, some of the episodes like ""Black Sun"" left you wondering ""how did they survive that?"" But that was the beauty of 1999, it was a show all it's own, and it stood up for itself. I was thrilled beyond belief when I heard they were releasing the entire series on DVD, unlike the last chance I had to watch the show on SciFi whom butchered the episodes to squeeze in more commercial time, releasing 1999 on DVD is a dream come true for all fans of the show. Watching the episodes on DVD brought back so many memories of getting a good seat in the living room just before the next episode was shown on TV. 1999 touched me like no other show has or probably ever will. I am surprised though that with today's computer technology in sfx used in movies....that no one has ever made a REAL Space:1999 movie. Wouldn't it be great to have a two hour movie based on the very first episode of ""Breakaway""?",995068800,6,1215,4.4774774774774775
1389303,5,B0000524FF,"I bought Box set 1 and 2, and although there aren't many extras on the DVD's, the episode were really great!  For 1975 it really had pretty good effects and interesting plots.  The actors are good, and come on, it's so cool to see a futuristic space show with analog clocks, bell bottom pants, and pre-mousse hair styles!!!

1389304,4,B0000524FF,"Space 1999 has earned its place in the ranks of SciFi television. I was reminded of the episode ""Voyager's Return"" after seeing a, you guessed it,  ST:Voyager episode dealing with the same theme, giving a unique oppertunity for comparison between the series. Strangely, the S1999 episode held up rather well and was in some ways superior to the Star Trek version.",993427200,3,363,4.950819672131147

More than 20 years later I cant forget  the horrrrrific conclusion to The End of Eternity,the terror of Dragons Domain,the mind-bending, gut-wrenching finale of War Games or the gruesome secret of The Mission Of The Darians! Commander Koenig is no Captain Kirk! You do not mess with him.  Space 1999 is superior to any thing that the powers that-be call ""science fiction"". No more sci-fi network for me ,just more episodes please.

1389365,5,B0000524FF,"Oh, what a relief!!  ""Space: 1999"" on DVD!! Six episodes for $30.00!! No more buying the laserdiscs on eBay!! What more do I need to say, except maybe ""hurry up with the Maya episodes!!""""",983923200,6,187,4.5
1389366,1,B0000524FF,"Space: 1999 is a bit of an enigma.  The show has both rabid fans that defend every aspect of the show, and very harsh critics, with very little middle ground.  In this sense, the fan following is similar to that of Star Trek.
That is where the similarities end, however.  When I originally saw this series, I was a rabid fan.  I was also 10 years old.  Now that I have seen these episodes again, I have become a harsh critic, for several reasons.  In every episode on these DVDs, at least one major scientific blunder is made, and the number is generally closer to 3 or 4 per episode.  Clearly real scientists were never consulted; the writers obviously knew little or nothing about physics, biology, or astronomy.  I have a big problem with a show passing itself off as hard core science fiction that can't even get high-school physics right.
Another major detraction is the TERRIBLE special effects.  I have read where people say how great the effects are, and I just have to wonder what they have been watching.  Perhaps the problem is that people are lumping all of the effects together into one category.  For example, I feel that the models and miniature work are TOP NOTCH, as is the overall design of the ships and the base itself.  It has been said George Lucas built on Space:1999's special effects for Star Wars: A New Hope.  With respect to the models and miniature work, I can believe that this is so.  However, effects involving planets, ship movements, energy beams, explosions, and spatial distortions (basically, ALL special effects that are not models or miniatures) are some of the WORST I have ever seen.  Star Trek did a much better job 10 years earlier and with a much smaller budget!  There's just no excuse for that.
The stories and acting are also not very good.  The commander seems to lead by yelling at people.  I guess this is supposed to be dramatic, but it just strikes me as absurd.  The character interaction also feels forced and unnatural.  And the Alphans are constantly flip-flopping between wanting to blow things up or giving in to alien domination.  In other words, the characters behave inconsistently from one episode to the next.
Getting back to the DVD set itself, I would only recommend it to people who are already fans of the show, or who enjoy the quaint campiness of ""B"" movies (""The Blob"", etc.).  Be warned that Space: 1999 takes itself very seriously.  It does not recognize it's own flaws and laugh at them.  In a way, that makes it even more amusing.  I must admit that I derive a good bit of pleasure from watching these episodes.  There are quite a few ""you've GOT to be kidding"" moments in these shows that will have anyone with a decent understanding of basic science rolling on the floor.  I don't really recommend that you let your kids watch though, because they might actually think the bad science is real and have to unlearn it later.
Each DVD contain 3 episodes, and essentially nothing else.  The ""bonuses"" are DVD production credits (I am just amazed that this is considered to be a ""bonus!""), and a few stills, most of which are just cells taking directly from the shows themselves.  The only thing that the DVD medium buys you is random access to the episodes.",983836800,7,3229,4.61578947368421
1389367,5,B0000524FF,"Well, there's no doubt I'm a scifi lover. But kids, this series is the good stuff. IT's pretty rare they make a series that delivers the real deal. Story, good acting. This is one of those critical series that really gave my imagination a jump start when I was young.  Share it with your kids. Enjoy it. There aren't many series like this one.",983750400,4,343,4.359375
1389368,4,B0000524FF,"Ask me how excited I was when I found out that Space 1999 was coming out on DVD!!! Ecstatic..thats what I felt. I remember as a kid in the late 70's sitting down on Sundays crosslegged and mesmerized by Catherine Schell and her transformations. Also the very beautiful and always classy Barbara Bain kept me occupied. I just purchased the boxed DVD sets and I cant get enough, the sharpness and clarity of the episodes are great the sound amazing and just watching it brings on a flood of good memories. They are supposedly bringing out the other episodes, this summer we should see boxes 3 and 4 so keep your fingers crossed and in the meantime enjoy Dr. Russell (Barbara Bain) and Commander Koenig (Martin Landau)as they search for a way home.",983750400,8,745,4.609022556390977
1389369,5,B0000524FF,"For me, life sure has been grand now that SPACE:1999 is being released on DVD.  After all these years, the show is just as entertaining now as when I would eagerly await each episode back in the '70s on the UHF station in St. Louis.  What set it apart from other efforts was the attention to detail, the thought provoking storylines, and the idea of everyone helping each other to survive.  It also had a very good design the likes of Silent Running and Kubrick's 2001. I find it funny that people criticised the show's logic in episodes like set #1's ""The Black Sun.""  Gee whiz, I'm still trying to figure out the last half hour of 2001!  Isaac Asimov was also too critical of this series--I've read some of Asimov's work and he is just as guilty on some things...guys, why do you think they call this science FICTION?
Another interesting thing was back when this show first aired, one of the major tabloids had an article saying SPACE:1999 was voted the most violent show on television (oh, my) and was all in a fit over one episode that showed a NAKED COUPLE IN BED... they were referring to this set's episode ""Force Of Life"" and what I saw was a couple wearing ROBES in bed!  And to think The Brady Bunch was daring for even having a man and a woman in the SAME bed!  This is all summed up best as Divine said in the film Hairspray: ""The times they are a'changin', somethin's blowin' in the wind...hand me my diet pills would ya, hon?""
This set contains one of the most visually striking episodes, ""The Guardian Of Piri"" and to this day friends still mention that episode for its exceptional set design.  ""Force Of Life"" has a set for the generator area that will have you eyeing all over the screen for it's vastness and details. Even the aliens are in a way beautiful and frightening at once, not like the ""new crease in the big forehead"" aliens Star Trek kept recycling in any of its given spinoffs. What is so satisfying about each episode of SPACE:1999 as well is that they leave you with something to ponder as the last scene ends in a freeze-frame and smacks you with the end theme.
Kick back, relax, and enjoy SPACE:1999 all over again.  Those who haven't seen it will even be pleasantly surprised, I'm certain of it!  Now, if only Streisand sang ""Alpha Can You Hear Me"" in Yentl...!!",983318400,9,2297,4.434679334916865
1389370,4,B0000524FF,"I have a theory:  millions of people are buying films and television shows on DVD that they never would have on VHS, and not necessarily just the films and shows that go into creating the ultimate collection, but often, just stuff you might be mildly interested in.  I bear out this theory myself in that I purchased perhaps ten VHS films throughout the history of it's existence, but have purchased about fifty DVDs in just the past 9 months.
Space: 1999 was a very unusual show.  Soft on the science, heavy on the fiction, with jaw-droppingly good models, sets and costumes (with the exception of the occasional stinker) and generally well-written, well acted stories.  However, the series (I own both sets of the first season) has a coldness and a distance to it that prevents me from attaching myself to this world as I have done with Star Trek and Star Wars.
When we are with the Alpha crew in Main Mission, even during a scene of tense crisis, there is a lack of rapport, closeness and comradery that makes me feel as isolated from the show as the Alphans are from Earth. There is a lack of realistic human connection that one would expect of a situation as desperate as theirs allgedly is.  Perhaps this was the intent of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, to impart the show an unspoken sense of melancholy and enuii.  If that's the case, I may credit their vision, but unfortunately the translation to compelling television ultimately fails.
I give this show a generous four stars, though 3.5 would be more appropriate- because of it's scale, it's grandeur, it's good writing and reasonably good acting.  It was ambitious, bold, beautiful, but well shy of a home run.  Nevertheless- for any fan of the genre, there is goodness and decent value here.  Don't buy it for the sparse extras, but for about $25 you get six nearly one hour episodes of a pretty good sci-fi show:  and that's not too shabby.",983059200,7,1900,4.6447761194029855
1389371,4,B0000524FF,"As I stated in my review of the first box set ( which actually contained comments on this box set...oops ), I am a big devotee of this show, and have particularly fond memories of it from my childhood.

Onto specifics: This box set contains one of the best gothic horror/SF shows ever filmed - ""Force Of Life"". Ian McShane  ( later to star in the charming British mystery series  ""Lovejoy"" ) plays a worker in one of Moonbase Alpha's Nuclear power plants, who becomes host to a mysterious glowing 'life form' that craves heat to survive. There is genuine warmth ( no pun intended ) in the scenes with his wife, and we feel a touch of pathos when he is eventually taken over completely by the life force.

There is abundant creepiness, stylish direction, good performances, and best of all... no falsely happy ending, or complete resolution to the mystery of the energy force's visit. Oh, there's a bit of conjecture by the professor as to the origin and motives of the being, but no concrete and unshakable explanation of the events - to paraphrase a certain pop-diva, "" Life is a mystery..""

Although the show was often critcized for it's open-ended and metaphysical stories, I've always found it a refreshing contrast to other shows which seem to feel that, 98% percent of the time, everything has to be explained away in great detail. Space 1999 often left events open to the viewer's own interpretation. Was it partly due to sloppy storytelling? On occasion yes. But still, I admire the series for what it tried to accomplish back in those dry days for SF between Star Trek and Star Wars.",981676800,6,1592,4.631205673758865
1389372,5,B0000524FF,"I was only seven years old when Space:1999 first aired here in Canada.  The adventures of the brave crew of Moon Base Alpha became the meat for many hours of childhood playacting. Space:1999 is perhaps one of the reasons that to this day I have an abiding love for science fiction in all it's forms.
Some might quibble with using the term 'science' in regards to Space:1999.  And they may be right.  The science is questinable at best.  However, this show is still one of the most enjoyable bits of space opera around.  The special effects are head an shoulders above anything produced up to that point, and in some cases don't appear dated even by todays standards.  Costuming and props were both excellent and well executed.  The sets are the most expansive I have seen in any science fiction episodic television.  At least for the first season!  While I shant degenerate into bashing the second season, I will say that the retooling of this show to make it over into something an American audience might enjoy certainly destroyed much of my enjoyment.
The production values on these discs are excellent.  The video tranfer exhibits very small amounts of noise or artifacting.  The soundtrack, while mono, is clear and crisp.  The packaging is excellent.  My only fault with this set is that there is very little in the way of extra features.  It surprises me that they did not seek out interviews with cast and crew where available to include as something of a retrospective.
Aside from that one rather minor quibble, I have totally enjoyed being taken back to the days of my childhood.  I look forward to adding all of the Season 1 DVD's to my collection!",981504000,3,1659,4.692041522491349

After putting these two disks in my ever hungry DVD player, here are my impressions:  The show has never looked better!  Over the years, viewers have been subjected to sub-standard copies, hacked up to make room for more commercials and then thrown into syndication.  A&E has done a fantastic job transfering the show from the original elements to ensure a near reference quality edition of the show. (Once in a while, there are the odd speck of dust.)  I am also impressed that A&E went to the effort to release the show in the proper order.  In addition, a selection of production stills are provided as an extra. This is very welcomed as it includes rare behind the scenes material that I believe have never been released before. There are also animated menus that capture the flavor of the show. All this attention to detail really shows that A&E cares about the quality of this release and the viewing satisfaction of the fans. (Are you listening Paramount Home Video?) I look forward to future releases in this series and hope to collect them all.",980812800,8,1218,4.668224299065421
1389374,5,B0000524FF,"Breakaway was pure awesome.  At the time it beat the socks off any other sci fi out there... It did not have the Saturday Night Fever invades hyperspace look of Buck Rodgers in the 25th Century that was on network TV about that time.  I feel Breakaway and, Voyagers Return are the real stand outs in this initial DVD series... Voyager was like so totally cool.  This episode grabbed you and, kept you interested.  Ernest Queller was a trully deep if a bit twisted man.  I found myself alternately loving and, hating Earnest Qwueller and, his technology.  I sort of agreed with both point and, counterpoint of his conflict.  As for Breakaway that stupid commissioner of the International Lunar Finance Commision Simmons I think was his name = (Their Dr. Smith) was a scream.  Simmons was such a timid weird whiney sick puppy.  Finally the special effects and the computer's dry nature were fascinating.  The only really bad thing about Year 1 was Barry Gray's morbid to dead lifeless musical score's.  I loved Space: 1999 Year 2, Some of the episodes made you think and, had bite others were just lost in space funny but the music score from Derek Wadsworth they had life of course I liked Disco.  Music scores were so much better in Spacve: 1999 Year 2 there is no comparing.  I wonder why they never made the Space 1999 Year 2 Soundtrack widely available in the USA.  I was and, still am aching for an easy way to buy the Space: 1999 Year 2 Soundtrack in the USA.  Here's hoping Amazon gets more Space: 1999 episodes and, both Year 1 & 2 soundtracks because, I would gladly buy many copies of all of it.
