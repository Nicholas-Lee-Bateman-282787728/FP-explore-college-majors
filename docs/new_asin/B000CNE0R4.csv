2466082,5,B000CNE0R4,"there are two shirley temple movies i consider the best. The little Colonel and the littlest rebel. These show her best acting ability. It's about time they put her films on dvd. Shirley will make you laugh and cry. The little colonel is about shirley and her grandfather and this one shows the famous tap dance with mr. Bo Jangles. Then, in the littlest rebel, she and her father have to hide from the yankees.  Hope you enjoy!",1144972800,9,428,4.487179487179487

2466107,5,B000CNE0R4,"This collection has three of Shirley Temple's best films:

1) DIMPLES (1936): Shirley plays a street performer in 1850s New York, who, after being separated from her pickpocket grandfather (Frank Morgan, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Two-Disc-70th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B002QWCN5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;fame), goes to live with a wealthy society matron, and eventually obtains stardom on the legitimate stage.  Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, while not appearing in the film, choreographed the dances for the film, which Shirley does with excellence, as always.

2) THE LITTLE COLONEL (1935): A period drama set in the post-Civil War South.  it is best known for the staircase dance between Shirley and Bojangles - Hollywood's first interracial dance team.  In the movie, Lionel Barrymore places a die-hard Confederate colonel who disowns his daughter after she marries a Yankee; Shirley, who is made an honorary Army colonel, eventually helps them to reconcile.

2) THE LITTLEST REBEL (1935): Also set during the Civil War.  It features Bill Robinson dancing solo to ""Turkey In The Straw,"" and later on, in another untitled dance duet with Shirley; they also sing ""Polly Wolly Doodle.""  Shirley plays Virgie Cary, the young daughter of a Confederate spy, who, along with a sympathetic Union officer who unsuccessfully tried to help Virgie and her dad escape to Richmond, where Herbert Cary's sister lives (Cary's wife had died of an illness), is arrested and imprisoned.  Virgie and Uncle Billy (Robinson) dance their way to Washington, and persuade President Lincoln to pardon the two men.

All three of these films are very entertaining and well-acted.  Like virtually all of the movies in the 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment Shirley Temple series, they feature both black-and-white and colorized versions of all three films (although the end of THE LITTLE COLONEL was actually filmed in Technicolor), Spanish and English subtitles, Spanish and English mono soundtracks, and a fake stereo English soundtrack, plus trailers for other Temple films and archival newsreel footage featuring Shirley in Hawaii and at her 6th and 7th birthday parties.

A highly recommended purchase.

I got the Vol. 2 set for my child Christmas 2010 and all was well with it. She loves it and of course preferred to watch it in color.(Vol 2 included both the B&W & colorized versions).

But when I read the Product details for this Vol 3 it says Black & White and does not mention Color.
It also says the language is SPANISH. I need none of that.
But in reading the user reviews some mention the colorization.

I presume Amazon only stands behind what it writes, not what we might find in a review for an item.

I am afraid to order due to all the confusion and of course there is no way to converse with Amazon for answer to this puzzle.
It is also available elsewhere on-line but that offering states that it is the recalled version.. I have no idea what that is all about ????

All 3 movies in this collection are racist, and should of stayed locked in the volt never to be released again. From using offensive  language such as pickaninny to depicting Shirley Temple as well as other characters in black face I hardly find something that could be this degrading to a race of people enjoyable entertainment. Yes what is depicted is a sign of the times the movie was made in but in this day and era we should be beyond that. Sadly anyone who could say that these three movies are the best of the collection says a lot about their character. I give it one star because I have to for the review but it actually deserves no stars. In fact I enjoyed watching volumes 1,2, and 4 of this collection and if I would of started with volume 3 I would not have purchased or watched any of the others.

He is constantly entertaining to watch and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the film --- Movie trivia collectors will recognize Stepin Fetchit, unbilled as Morgan's servant --- as usual in most Shirley Temple films, she performs`What Did The Bluebird Say,' `He Was A Dandy,' and, with The Hall Johnson Choir, `Get On Board, Little Children' --- Although he does not appear in the film, the legendary Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson choreographed Shirley's tap routines; his influence is readily apparent --- -Shirley Temple is quite glorious and the musical numbers are lively and fun.

My daughter has watched them over and over several times and she still enjoys seeing them.,1184544000,,260,5.166666666666667

2466162,5,B000CNE0R4,"I just finished watching this volume 3 collection and want to wholeheartedly endorse it.

I had read some reviews that the picture quality and sound was not so good and was doubtful if I should buy it, but bought it all the same as I had enjoyed the other two volumes so much.

Well I was not disappointed at all. The sound quality was very good. Try listning to it on the stereo option on the on-screen menu.

These are three of her very best films and you will laugh and enjoy them so much.

My wife never ever heard of Shirley Temple till 2006 when I introduced her to Shirley's films and now we both are big fans and look forward to these re-releases.

'The Little Colonel' and 'The littlest Rebel' both have the excellent Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson acting and dancing in fine form with Shirley.

Bill worked out the dance routines in all these three pictures but only stars in the above mentioned two.

No one grabs my attention like Shirley. It's a whole combination of things like her smile and laughter, her dancing and mannerisms and she cry's so realistic that you would think she is really upset (but no it's just our Shirley doing her stuff, excellent as useual).

Shirlet Temple is a gale of fresh air in a very stale and cynical world and her films will restore hope and confidence to you in the human race.

Why not check out her official web site and send her an e-mail. She's still going strong.",1167350400,39,1411,4.416988416988417
2466163,1,B000CNE0R4,"I am returning the Vol. I movie, Heidi, movie was terrible; movie jumped all over the place throughout the entire movie.  I am returning for another one that hopefully works.  These should be checked out before they are sent.  I had wanted it for a XMas gift for my daughter; good thing I looked at it first.  I am very disappointed.  I hope the next one works.",1166486400,3,361,4.3283582089552235
2466164,3,B000CNE0R4,"I own all 3 of these Shirley Temple sets that have been released so far.  The sound quality seems to be going downhill...

All 3 of the DVDs in Volume One were okay.  I was very pleased with that set.  In Volume Two, I noticed that the sound quality in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm was not that great (quiet voices and comparatively loud music).  In this last volume, the sound was questionable in The Littlest Rebel... but it was atrocious in Dimples.  It sounded as if all the actors were talking into pillows.  I have watched these films on VHS and the sound is fine... perhaps something went wrong when they were put onto DVD.

I will say, however, that I absolutely love The Littlest Rebel and The Little Colonel.  They're probably my favourite Shirley Temple movies, so to find them both in Volume Three was great.  I was worried about The Little Colonel, though.  The last scene was originally shot in Technicolor; however, in Fox's last VHS release of the movie (colourized), they cut the scene!  I was so glad to see that the lovely ""pink party"" scene was included in this version... it's wonderful to see such an early example of colour in the movies.

As with the other two sets, the colourization of the black and white films is good (much better than previous attempts).  However, the sound quality really annoyed me.  Had I known it would be so bad, I would have just skipped Dimples and purchased the other two DVDs separately.",1149638400,57,1440,4.5703125

8099337,5,B000CNE0R4,"Delightful as always!  The Little Colonel and The Littlest Rebel are really interesting from a storyline perspective considering the times.  Both are set during the civil war.  The aspect of slavery and how African Americans were depicted, not only for civil war times, but even during the making of these movies is a consideration for the viewer.  The now famous stairwell dance sequence in The Little Colonel that Temple did with Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson was the first interracial scene on screen and magnificent.  ""Bojangles"" in this viewers opinion was the scene stealer and its a real shame he wasn't filmed more.  At the time, he was 57 and Temple was a mere 6 years of age.  ""Bojangles"" appears again with Temple as Uncle Billy in The Littlest Rebel and their dance routines as just as fantastic.  All the supporting actors depicting slaves and their children were so outstanding that the movies would fail completely without them.  Temple as always is adorably delightful and without her movies we may have never been treated to the genius and wonderful presence of Bill Robinson.",1500076800,2,1089,4.972375690607735
