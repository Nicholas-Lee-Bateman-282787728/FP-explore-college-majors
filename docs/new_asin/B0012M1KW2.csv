3092457,5,B0012M1KW2,"This DVD is a bargin, especially for seniors like myself.

 In my opinion, applying these findings to one's life style is one of the best ways to stay young and engaged.

 I could not digest all this information in one viewing so the dvd really comes in handy because one of the foundations in learning new skills is repetition.

 The DVD shows that science can now provide images of what parts of the brain are engaged when the subject is performing various mental tasks. I found is really interesting as it provides more facts about how our brains actually work. My hearing could be better, but I turned captioning off on the TV (my eyes were replacing my ears).  Now i try harder with my ears, ha,ha.

 Yeah! New challanges for learning; I recently got a new digital camera and find that the more I use it the more motivated I become in learning how to take and make great images and then view them in hidef on the new TV. Build those synapse connections! Yeah.

 One last point, the program stresses keeping your heart strong. I hike 3-4 miles every day, its not hard once one gets out, yes, it does take time, but my dog and camera come along also, so its not boring (for me), and I see and enjoy much more walking than I ever did driving.",1204934400,78,1244,4.341991341991342
3092458,2,B0012M1KW2,"I donated to PBS and got the set of Brain Training items.  This dvd is just the PBS program all over again. It is NOT a brain training program with exercises you can do, etc. It's talking heads plugging how great their program is.  It's marginally interesting on first viewing but I can't see wanting to watch it again. Just watch it on PBS and save your money.

The actual brain program this dvd touts is very expensive and available on the website.  It came w/ my donation and it's very well made, but is truly boring, as the other reviewer stated, I dread doing it (and in fact, haven't in a week or more). It's focus is auditory not visual which is ok but it'd be better if it had both.  I haven't done it enough to give a thorough review of it or it's benefits.",1204761600,296,766,4.183673469387755
3092479,5,B0012M1KW2,"For years scientists believed that once the brain had gone through its critical period of childhood growth and learning, it had completed its development. THE BRAIN FITNESS PROGRAM dispels that contention by unveiling what over 50 international neuroscientists at the frontier of brain science have concluded about neuroplasticity -- the brain's ability to grow, learn, adapt, and even rewire itself beyond our youth and into old age. Host Peter Coyote unravels the secrets and mysteries behind this cutting edge science to offer one of the most inspiring and optimistic views of human brain health - how to help the brain help itself. This program explores the foundation of these new discoveries and illustrates a system for strengthening the brain to make it perform with more agility, speed and comprehension particularly in the area of sound processing and hearing. It is based on the premise that if we exercise our brain, as we do our bodies, we can continue to operate at a high peak of attention in which all of our senses remain sharp and fully engaged until the last days of our lives.

3092481,5,B0012M1KW2,"I don't know what some people were expecting.  This is an overview of recent research on the subject of brain plasticity. As far as the name, I see nothing wrong with that.  Did some of you reviewers really expect a comprehensive program with a explicit recipe to change your life after sitting down for an hour in front of the TV screen?  You should be able to put 2 and 2 together though, and figure out a lot of self evident principles from viewing this, to guide you in making changes to improve your mental fitness.  A few of these are; (1) Your long term mental fitness will be determined both by genetic and environmental factors. Learning new mental skills will likely serve to avoid or delay eventual mental deterioration, but the learning has to be new and different learning from what you are accustomed to...if you have been doing cross word puzzles all your life, continuing to do them will not be of help. If you have not done them, beginning to do would be beneficial in this respect.  Learning a 2nd language would probably benefit most minds.  Physical activities that require physical coordination (such as new complex dances) would benefit.  You get the idea, you have to keep learning new things to get the benefit. (2) Apparently one can significantly maintain neural functions by exercise, but it needs to be more extensive (5 days a week) and higher intensity than perhaps most people who exercise are accustomed to go at. Personally I suggest pushing yourself for say one minute every four minutes, and building from that until you can sustain a higher intensity level.  (3) We can improve our mental functions, train ourselves, break addictions, by simply stopping the activity. One has to catch oneself and resist the dopamine release, and stop acting on the impulse that leads to undesired responses. Your mind will naturally rewire eventually if you persist, and the unwanted response will weaken.  (4) Concentration is key, the mind is much more adaptable when you focus, very inflexible when you don't.  There is more, but I will stop with those three items.  I learned a lot from this DVD.  It also exposes you to some of the leading advocates of this line of thinking, for further reading.  No it is not perfect.  The presentation format gives you the impression that it is an infomercial, but in fact it is not that at all. Perhaps had they thought this through and presented in in a manner more typical of PBS, this misconception could have been avoided.",1281312000,18,2488,4.755813953488372

There are several extra features running from 1-25 minutes each, which may be leftover material from the main feature. A ""play all"" feature should have been included for those, since all together they are less than an hour.

When one is already doing all the things one enjoys it is hard to think of, or find time, to include any more activities.

If you're, ahem, north of 45, and starting to feel it, this is a great documentary to watch, to learn how it is possible to start to reverse the effects of aging on the brain. It doesn't present specific exercises; it just makes the empirical case for doing braining fitness exercises.",1420243200,,330,4.910714285714286

It is easy be become complacent as we get older and take the easy way out with TV.  That is why the TV in our house is not on during the day.  It is peaceful and our heads can be challenge with evey day like and exercise both physically and mentally.  We watch a good movie each night, NO Commercials to stop the story flow.",1399334400,,476,4.175824175824176

If your parents are older or you are in a care-giving profession, you will find this useful also.",1360195200,,243,4.545454545454546
8246841,5,B0012M1KW2,"It seems there is a lot of misunderstanding because of the semantics of the words in the title.

Unlike many of the reviewers both my partner and myself did not anticipate that this would be a specific mind fitness program as in an exercise program. We saw it as the collective research integrated into the form of a program of easy understanding for the lay-person. The data is all brought together under one theme: the plasticity of the brain and that the brain's ""fitness"" can be improved at any age or even in drastic circumstances such as brain injury etc.

The definition for 'program' in my American Heritage dictionary: 1a. ""A listing of the order of events and other pertinent information for a public presentation."" 1b ""The presentation itself: 'a program of piano pieces'."" 7. ""An instruction sequence in programmed instructions.""  There certainly in no buffoonery going on here!!! (a buffoon is a clown, jester, or fool...)",1353888000,,935,4.942675159235669
8246842,5,B0012M1KW2,"I saw this program on PBS and was fascinated by the science, which is expertly presented and done so in an interesting and easy-to-understand manner.  I don't understand why anyone was confused between the TV program, which educates us, and the software programs -- one for eyesight, and the other for hearing -- which is for the individual to use for training.

I saw the PBS program.  Then I bought the software.  I was disappointed in neither.

In fact, I found the software immensely helpful.  I improved both my hearing and eyesight.  I was grateful.

Yes, it takes work.  Anything that requires work can be ""boring.""  If your eyesight and hearing are important to you, then the DVDs will likely be enormously helpful.  But they won't work if you just sit and stare at the box.

I had side benefits from the program, too. My balance increased, my memory increased, and my confidence increased.

I highly recommend the program and the DVDs.",1329350400,3,944,4.753086419753086
