Like others, I too have worn out my VHS version and can't wait to buy it on DVD...if it's ever released! I highly, highly recommend this picture! Perfect for the entire family, it will surely become a favorite for everyone! Having watched Phar Lap well over 50 times, I still get goose-bumps when I hear the the beautiful score that plays during the races. A true classic!",1105660800,,456,4.440476190476191
1517236,5,B00005JMVI,"Phar Lap was foaled in New Zealand and sold to Australia where he raced to the top! This movie is one of the all-time best true stories brought to the big screen ever produced. Phar Lap The Movie is as sensational as the horse himself. Wicked! Now lets protest and get this movie released on DVD !!!!!

If you liked ""Seabiscuit"" at all or love horses or animals or have any kind of a heart, see this movie. I have loved this movie since I rented it when I was about 7 years old. This movie was released in 1982. It's about a famous Australian racehorse, still an icon in Australia, named Phar Lap. Unlike a lot of other ""horsey"" movies/stories, it's not focused around a child and a horse or other kid tales. That's what makes it so appealing to ANYBODY who has a heart for animals. His story is incredible and much more incredible, in my opinion, than Seabiscuit. It is an extremely sad, heart-wrenching movie, too. But I guarantee that if you give it a chance you will love it. The acting is superb, the drama intense, the soundtrack is BEAUTIFUL (won awards that year), and it is truly unforgettable.
I purchased this movie on VHS (not available on DVD yet!) back when buying a VHS tape of a movie set you back about $90. I still cherish that tape and pray, pray, pray it never gets ruined for I will be heartbroken. I watch it at least once a year. I have plans to copy it to DVD from VHS, but I haven't the equipment to do that yet. That should be my next project. Or maybe they should just release it on DVD, huh?  ;)

Other similarly good movies in this fashion are ""The Man From Snowy River"" and it's sequel ""Return to Snowy River"". I urge you to at least rent all three of these!",1076630400,6,1441,4.251824817518248
1517238,5,B00005JMVI,"With the ""Seabiscuit"" fury going on, I hope the studio and higher ups realize that this film was a ""hidden gem"" and that with the release of Wincer's THE YOUNG BLACK STALLION to IMAX theaters, they will consider this venture and this very worthy film. I can see the TV spots now.......""Before SEABISCUIT there was the ""other"" wonder horse from down under, PHAR LAP ......he'll surely race into your hearts"". I know I'll be the first in line to buy it. I wore out the VHS tape and this is a truly stunning story about an amazing horse, eccentric trainer, caring jock and an owner who learned how ""to believe"" - doesn't this sound familiar, Seabiscuit fans? And the soundtrack and photography are just incredible .... the story will leave the same hole in your heart as did Seabiscuit. And, the mystery continues ....who killed Phar Lap and why hasn't the studio released this amazing horse story to DVD. Go Baby Go!",1071878400,45,914,4.648148148148148
7940472,5,B00005JMVI,"I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD!  I keep checking to see if it has but to no avail.  This is such a great film and deserves to be shared with everyone.  If you weren't around when it came out in the theatre, you missed out.  People have heard of and/or saw the wonderful films of Seabiscuit and Secretariat but there never is any conversation about PharLap which is equally outstanding.

Please, Please, Please hurry up and get this available on DVD!",1374451200,,465,4.3604651162790695
7940473,5,B00005JMVI,I have the vhs & loved it! I use to be a horse trainer myself & this movie just shows how bad it was for the horses back in the day. I did a bit of research myself & this movie isn't far from the truth. CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE DVD!! I would have loved to see pharlap & secretariat & seabiscuit run!. Only a horse person would REALLY enjoy this movie & cry.,1324944000,,354,3.7333333333333334

7940476,5,B00005JMVI,"Throw together the modern real life drama's of Smarty Jones and Barbaro, then add Seabiscuit to the mix along with a measure of life-threatening intrigue, and you have something close to the tale of the magnificent Phar Lap, a real-life equine Olympian.

Director Simon Wincer crafted this film in such a way the story drew me to new emotional highs and didn't let go. A very memorable film.",1151971200,4,391,4.75

7940479,5,B00005JMVI,"I have owned my VHS copy of Phar Lap for a very long time and never get tired of this movie.  I wish the ""powers that be"" would release this movie on DVD. The human characters in this movie were great co-stars to Phar Lap (especially enjoyed Tom Burlinson) - this movie was the reason I immediately saw Man From Snowy River.

I am afraid of riding horses, but my heart is captured by Phar Lap.  He demonstrates strength, bond between human and animal and heart/love.

Please release on DVD.

Thanks,

Pat",1121126400,9,504,4.423913043478261
7940480,5,B00005JMVI,"May be sound excessively exaggerate to affirm we are in front the most sincere and heartfelt homage to a true legend Australian racehorse that chewed up the track in the 1920s and early 1930s.

This film is simply an additional proof of what the untamed spirit can become. From Australia came the surprise that muted many people from all the corners in the world. Phar Lap was a phenomena and force of nature.

Arresting and intense images all the way.

To my mind the masterpiece of Simon Wincer.",1119312000,3,497,4.625
7940481,5,B00005JMVI,"Being a horse lover from childhood, it's a given that I seek out any & every horse flick I can find. But none has had quite the impact on me that this movie did. The movie 'Seabiscuit' came close, but I'd have to say he lost by a nose at the finish to 'Phar Lap'. Perhaps the tragic ending made this film that much more poignant; be sure to have a FULL box of Kleenex when you watch this one!

I wore out my VHS copy of this movie in record time, but for those of you lamenting the fact it's not available on DVD, go to eBay and query Phar Lap. You will find 1-2 pages of this movie available on DVD. (I believe it's an Australian release, but I'm not positive, however it plays fine in US DVD players). I just received mine last week & it's very good quality.

You can also find a limited number of copies of the Phar Lap soundtrack CD (the composer, Bruce Rowland, has released a limited edition of 1000). This is one of the most beautiful, haunting, and epic soundtracks I've ever heard and words can't begin to do it justice. My delight at finding THIS gem can't be put into words either; I've listened to it every day since receiving it several weeks ago)! The movie + the music = a film experience that's just hard to beat (as was Phar Lap).

Whatever or whoever killed Phar Lap, his life was living testimony to the fact that it's not the quantity but the quality of our lives that matter. In 5 short years, he left a legacy that will forever be remembered by those who were lucky enough to see him run ... and those lucky enough to share his story. May you rest in peace, 'Bobby'.",1111881600,6,1588,4.166123778501628
