4231581,5,B003YVP53O,"The story is a lot more sophisticated and well-developed than most movies made for a high-school audience.  The acting and theme were excellent.  This movie is more artistic and less action-packed than movies like To Save a Life, so it may have a different type of audience within the same age group.  I don't know if this was the reason why it did not sell as well as (and not as well known or publicized as) To Save a Life.",1369526400,3,425,4.2875
4231582,5,B003YVP53O,"This is a great movie for those of us that are recovering type A personalities.  I am not near as head strong as I have gotten older, though I want to marry one.  It entertained me as what movies SHOULD do and it also got me to look closer at how someone else could see the world.  I am more referring to her then him.  How he was soo drawn to her even as she was.  And she certainly has a bit of an attitude in the beginning.  I thought it was a great movie.",1364601600,,459,3.778947368421053
4231583,5,B003YVP53O,"Part of my job is reviewing movies for a national magazine (AFA Journal). I saw several cheesy movies last year. This movie, while it does have its cheesy moments, and it does start slow, was the best movie I watched last year. The character development is great, the story line is fantastic. I am also a youth pastor and would encourage any person who works with teenagers to host a movie night and watch this film. It is just an overall great, family-friendly, wonderful movie.",1296604800,8,479,4.647058823529412
4231584,5,B003YVP53O,"This movie was a gracious gift from one of the people appearing in the film. Prior to this I had only seen this person in comedic roles and was expecting more of the same with Upside. I was so wrong. I hope you will give the movie a chance. It starts slow but the development of the story and the ending make it all worth the watching. It is beautifully done and I believe all ages will benefit from it. However, if you have a teenager or a young adult, make this a MUST see together. I assure you my 5 star rating has nothing to do with the individual who worked in the film. It is simply THAT good...",1293494400,5,602,4.025

8409797,5,B003YVP53O,"My 12- and 14-year girls and male visitors liked this.  They weren't as thrown off as I that the protagonist's Plan B--or was it Plan C?--for college was so easily achieved, nor by the jettison-able subplots about the two mentors. I liked that the story depicted plausible resistance to temptation. I particularly liked that the female lead had much the same snarky yet focused character--ahem--as the several blind people I have known.",1443398400,,436,5.055555555555555

8409801,5,B003YVP53O,Awesome example of how we may go thru tragedies in our lives but we are never alone. Everything bad in life can somehow be turned around and used to glorify God but we need to let it work through us first.,1400025600,2,205,4.024390243902439
8409802,4,B003YVP53O,I hope Leah Sims continues to do as well with her other projects. The subtlety of the story's message won't keep any one from enjoying this film.,1387324800,,145,4.407407407407407
