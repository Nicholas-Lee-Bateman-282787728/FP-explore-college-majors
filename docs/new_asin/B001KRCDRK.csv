I am sure his DVD is going to be easy to follow and will be a great addition to anyone's practice of moving meditation, especially as it is representative of his teaching style.",1228521600,2,346,4.75

3668910,3,B001KRCDRK,"Good training video, except that the picture of the Tai Chi instructor is backwards. For instance,  when instructed to turn left the on-screen instructor turns right.  Very difficult to follow the exercise when the words do not match the picture.",1472256000,,246,5.125

3668915,4,B001KRCDRK,"I recently received this DVD and found it very interesting.  As a beginner, what Barnes teaches is really good for me.  I'm enjoying it.  But what I'm looking for now is just an audio version of some sort that I can listen to downloaded to my Android.",1453939200,,251,4.297872340425532
3668916,5,B001KRCDRK,"Excellent video.  I love this guy.  He's not someone with movie star looks or a flashy personality, but he is easy to follow and I feel great after doing the Tai Chi movements.  Of course, it would be cool to get some really macho actor to step in and do a video like this, wouldn't it?  Or a comedian!  Now that would be entertaining!  But this is a good workout.  Some reviewers complain that he's not ""authentic,"" but seriously, I really don't care.  How I feel after the program is what matters to me!",1453161600,,505,4.297872340425532

3668928,5,B001KRCDRK,"This was the first exposure I had to Tai Chi.  Originally seen via Netflix.  Liked it, but couldn't keep it.  It has closed captioning which I need.  Plus the instructor, Samuel Barnes gives very good instructions (i.e. ""90% of your weight is now on the right leg"").  After I sent it back to Netflix, I bought a different Tai Chi DVD from the local video store, and it was terrible!  No closed captioning, the woman was wearing huge, ugly blue print pajamas which were distracting, and the flow was constantly interrupted by graphic drawings of human muscles.  So, I was feeling very nostalgic for Samuel Barnes and his video, so ordered it from Amazon.",1427587200,2,653,4.675438596491228

3668952,3,B001KRCDRK,"Have bought several element dvd's before.  For the most part, I am happy with them  - instruction is clear, scenary is nice, voiceover is soothing.  The first series of instructions in this one are very concise which  is a perk - unfortunately, as one progresses somehow it seems a lot less clear - added to which, the voiceover might've been just a little too soothing.  Struggling with figuring out poses is not a good combination when you find yourself getting bored with the voice instruction.",1389312000,,497,4.8
3668953,4,B001KRCDRK,We are enjoying this tape at our Senior Center.  The directions are clear and the movements and meditative direction lead us through the meditative exercise.,1385424000,,157,5.28
3668954,1,B001KRCDRK,I first part of video was just fine as it did not use left or right movements. But when the instructor goes into the movement that require you to turn Left/Right he moves the opposite. It was a little confusing but I thought that it must just be me being new to program. I found the instruction very hard to keep up with. I kept thinking he was going the wrong way. I was when he said to raise your left foot and he raised he right that I knew something was wrong with his instructions. I retired from USMC and when leading exercise we would use the mirrow method. He probable narrated this video by watching and got confused. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing and replayed several times. I have been programed(USMC) to respond to commands of left and right and unable to perform these by doing the opposite. I cannot beleive that no one else has noticed this.,1381276800,7,863,4.333333333333333

3668968,3,B001KRCDRK,"He teaches all of the poses at once.  It would be nice if the positions were grouped.  For example if you learned 3 or 4 then went back and started the sequence at 1, learned the next four and went back and started from 1 etc...It would also be nice if he took a little more time on the footwork and hand motions.",1354147200,2,313,3.9523809523809526

3668970,5,B001KRCDRK,"Excellent.  In the first part,  Barnes immediately goes into teaching and modeling how to do the Tai Chi.  His voice is soothing, he goes slowly enough that one can follow him, and he is thorough.  Also, I like the background.  Good for seniors or anyone who needs a cardiovascular workout.  More fun than doing exercises which tire the body and produce nothing.",1340755200,,362,4.758064516129032
3668971,5,B001KRCDRK,This is great for a daily workout with some one that is very into the craft willing to calm and explain the movements with reflecting and reminder words said with calming words to help retain the moments of calm. This is my recommendation for anyone over 50 that enjoys stretching but not wanting to feel frustrated.,1333756800,2,316,4.660714285714286
3668972,5,B001KRCDRK,"This was a very good introduction to Tai Chi. I had never seen any instruction on it before and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was soothing; his voice, the setting and the movements. I give this DVD a ""thumbs up""! Enjoy.",1331856000,,226,4.675
3668973,5,B001KRCDRK,"I have been using this tape on and off for about 3 months now.  For an absolute beginner with no experience, this has been a very nice introduction into Tai Chi.  The movements are explained thoroughly and demonstrated two times in a row in order to practice.  Even after putting the DVD away for a couple of weeks and then going back to it, the next few times the movements came more naturally.  Great warm up exercises to open the body.  I have many injuries from years of playing tennis, volleyball and racketball and these movements are challenging to the brain and body, but not hard on my joints.  I feel refreshed after going through the DVD.",1331769600,4,649,4.504273504273504

3668975,2,B001KRCDRK,"I used a beginners tai chi with Scott Cole a few years ago. I loved it and it helped with balance issues and felt like a workout. This DVD is so disappointing. Too many small steps. They ask you to inhale and 6 steps later to exhale. That's not going to happen. After 30 min. I felt like I accomplished nothing. Too much detail took the joy that I remember out of Tai Chi. There is nothing in these tai chi moves that will be of help for my balance. I got so annoyed I turned off the DVD. The rest may be better, but I wasn't going to use another 30 minutes to see.",1329868800,2,565,3.9217391304347826

3668977,5,B001KRCDRK,"Excellent DVD, each movement is completely explained and gone over more than once. The Mirror image takes some getting used to but after practicing with the DVD for a week I was able to do the ""flow"" without the DVD.",1328832000,,216,4.425
3668978,5,B001KRCDRK,"I got this as a gift for the holidays. It was promptly shipped.

3668980,4,B001KRCDRK,"I purchased this for my husband, and he is quite happy with the CD.  It has a introductory part where they break the moves down step by step which is great for beginners.  The setting of the classes are beautiful and we enjoy the routines.  Overall, a great introduction to the martial art of Tai Chi.",1324080000,2,301,4.339285714285714
3668981,1,B001KRCDRK,This video was hard to follow especially when you are watching the movements and the narrator is telling you the oppisite of what you are seeing.  Plus when I asked for a refund they said if it was opened there was no refund.  How would I know about it if I did not watch the video?,1323820800,6,282,4.017857142857143
3668982,4,B001KRCDRK,"I have just received this dvd and used it for the first time. I think it is a good start for beginners as I am. Basic moves, not too many or too long. BUT, it is a little confusing. You must mirror him in the video. He will say move your left leg,and he is moving his right. Got a bit confusing at times, but again mirror him on the tv and do your best to follow. I did pretty well for the most part,but there were times when I did not know which leg to use as I was listening to him and watching.",1323388800,2,497,3.742857142857143
3668983,3,B001KRCDRK,"While this is a nice tai chi workout,  its very confusing because the instructor speaks about using one side of the body while he using the opposite side. So if you have worked out with anyone before, his method is very difficult to follow. He really should use the same side of the body that he is speaking about, ie left, right...",1323388800,2,332,4.354838709677419
3668984,5,B001KRCDRK,"I'm a total newbie to Taichi and now I'm hooked thanks to this DVD.

I get SO relaxed as I'm doing each exercise and afterwards, man, the world can blow up and I wouldn't notice.

Inhale....exhale.... this is what everyone needs to wind down and feel serene.

I read a few other reviews where they said that it's not easy to follow along because he's facing the camera and it gets confusing....

What? How hard is it to mirror what he's doing? Not hard at all!

I never get confused and I follow along EASY, and the pace is perfect.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn TaiChi for the first time or who just wants to learn how to relax and wants a good basic no frills routine that's clear, simple and works.

Worth it!",1318723200,5,742,4.257142857142857
3668985,4,B001KRCDRK,"Completed a beginner Tai Chi class, but found my work schedule wouldn't permit a follow-up. This DVD has proved to be an excellent continuation. Qi Gong exercises at the beginning work on breathing, some balance, and stretching. Next section goes through beginner moves, naming them and performing them twice to help to remember them. Third section goes through whole routine uninterupted so learner can see the entire routine. Only one or two really strenuous moves, so good for elder crowd. Am enjoying this.",1315872000,5,510,5.156626506024097

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase the DVD by Samuel Barnes. However, my excitment quickly turned to disappointment when the disc would not play.

3668988,5,B001KRCDRK,I recently purchased this DVD to embark on a new journey toward better over-all health.  I was not disappointed!

3668989,3,B001KRCDRK,"Leave it to hollywood to have 97 cameras for a simple instructional video, looks nice but's hard to follow the instructor when you jump from a frontal view to a camera on crane or a jib when your in the middle of leaning a series of moves. I watched and learned on a old cheap video from the library that was better than this because the use one camera angle. The production value of this video is way overblown resulting in a nice looking but hard to follow instructional video. You will be watching this guy, tying to mirror his moves in opposite side of the body then they do a 360 around the guy and your left trying to listen to what he is saying and it gets confusing. Poorly thought out, should have tested it on beginners.",1307923200,3,730,4.258992805755396
3668990,5,B001KRCDRK,"I was familiar with, but had never tried Qi Gong or Tai Chi.  The instructor in the video goes through the motions slowly so that you can get used to them before putting them together into one fluid motion.  It is very relaxing, like a moving meditation.

I just key up on his instructions on the sound track. He say's right or left.  He breaks down the postures one move at a time and repeats each move twice. After you have practiced the postures, there is a section where you go through the whole sequence without stopping.  The Qi Gong section is also excellent.  This wasn't a very expensive dvd.  It contains a lot of excellent material. I try to practice every day and find the dvd very relaxing and meditative.

He was going slow, so you can figure it out.. but I would have liked a little more direction on how to do the move correctly, or even what the name of the move was.  Id get it if you know the basics of Tai Chi and want another slower/beginner type video.

3669043,3,B001KRCDRK,"Let me start off this review stating that I am a complete newcomer to Tai Chi.  I've seen people do it in groups and wanted to try it for health and fitness benefits.  This DVD got good ratings so I got it.

I noticed right away that as another reviewer noted, he teaches you in ""mirror"" style, which was confusing to follow at times but not hard to figure out after a few rounds.  I liked the step-by-step manner in which he taught, and the soothing music and scenery.  A we progressed through the forms, I noticed that some of the movements I thought of when I thought of Tai Chi were not present in this DVD.  After researching I discovered that there is no ""one"" style of Tai Chi, there are many schools and styles, and what I was probably thinking of was the 24-form ""Beijing"" style.  So I was a little disappointed that this was not the 24-form Tai Chi I was hoping, but rather a 13-form style that I couldn't identify from watching Tai Chi videos on the internet, so I'm not sure where these forms he uses come from.  He doesn't give any history or background to his style so it's a mystery to me.

Lastly, the Qi Gong section was just a little too new-agey for me.  I wanted to learn Tai Chi for better balance and concentration and to improve my fitness routine.  If that's what you are looking for too then I would try another Tai Chi DVD from a different instructor.",1250985600,266,1377,4.277992277992278

This is an encouraging and easy-to-follow instructional DVD. Mr. Barnes has a wonderful manner of gradually walking you through each movement so that the beginning student can master it and continue to build on that rather than quit too soon out of a feeling of exasperation.",1244851200,39,451,7.37037037037037
3669045,4,B001KRCDRK,"I practice TaeKwon Do and I got this DVD as a kind of complement to the courses I take, knowing that Tai Chi is much lower impact and meditative, yet it still has elements of balance and energy that might hopefully help me improve in my practice.  It's a lot like what I expected, very slow and careful movements that flow in time with your breathing, and I think it's very peaceful and yet still decent exercise.

I found this DVD to be an absolute wealth of information.  The instructor sure manages to talk about absolutely everything, so you have no problems understanding where your feet are supposed to be, or where your weight is, or what each posture is supposed to be representing.  It was really quite useful, and while he covers a lot of material very quickly, even in the introductory section while we're learning the postures, I managed to remember a lot of it, and it did seem natural after only a few practice sessions.

My problems with this DVD are minimal.  First, I would like him to go a little slower in the Qi Gong section.  While I know that everyone is different and will move at their own pace, he says to time your movements to the inhale and exhale of your breath, and to use your full lung capacity with each movement, and yet, I was halfway through one inhale/exhale combination when he was done with his second, so I was kind of left behind at a few points.  Maybe I just have exceptional lung capacity, but as an ex-smoker, I kind of doubt this.

Another problem that I found was that I don't think that the flow gives equal attention to both right and left legs, as I found my right side to be harder worked than the left.  A reverse flow might also have been helpful, but perhaps there is a good reason this is not included.  According to instruction, each direction of movement is supposed to have specific metaphysical benefits.",1240099200,236,1863,4.466076696165191

The instructor is performing in what is supposed to be a mirror image while the audio speaker explains the movements. This did not work for me as I am very visual and the instructor is moving his left body parts while the audio says to move your right. It would help if they explained that they were going to use the mirror effect which they don't. The confusion is compounded by the fact the the camera also changes angles adding to the confusion. If you ask me it should have been filmed using overhead angles so it would be easier to follow. I personally don't recommend it.",1235433600,55,680,4.362204724409449
3669048,5,B001KRCDRK,just received the DVD and i am watching it- i like the instructors calm non hurried yet comprehensive and informative manner and his enthusiasm for the exercises he teaches both physical and spiritual- this is how i got hooked on yoga years ago= and i can see why his studio has been a success. i needed a beginners because i know NOTHING aboubt Tai chi or Qi Gong and have heard good things so i thought i'd try this DVD to include it into my workout schedule. i believe watching this DVD it is the program i am looking for. its got Qi Gong to prepare yourself then breakdown of Tai Chi moves- then he teaches you how to do the flow so it has slow steps for people like myself to build my practice without being overwhelmed. the first time i tried it with a VHS years ago i don't even remember who it was by- was certainly not like this Element DVD!  they simply threw too much at me all at once. the background is lovely view of the ocean which i also love. Highly recommend!  adding to my review March 11 2009- i've been using this DVD for the past week Three days i injured myself after i first received this DVD and my plans to use it had to be put on hold.  After being upset that i couldn't do my yoga i discovered i CAN do this so far its helped heal me by getting me moving but not aggravating the healing muscles from my injury.  i throughly enjoy it and look forward to the time i set aside to do this-  The qi gong section is 18 minutes if i can stand injured for 18 minutes and do this i recommended it to my friends and family as well. i guess i'm not as visual as the other reviewer as i just now figured out that mirror image problem they had it really hasn't mattered to me and i wouldnt give a low rating to something when its your personal preference. i have no problem following along with the excellent and detailed verbal instructions and mimicing the instructor and have spent many enjoyable sessions doing this practice and would recommend it it to anybody to include in thier workout. i feel calmer yet energized after it. still highly recommend,1234915200,131,2070,4.230379746835443
8316007,5,B001KRCDRK,"This video was a pleasant surprise after some of the negative reviews.  First, the Qigong part was 18 minutes, easy to follow and featured some interesting moves (ie. Teacups) that you don't always see in a beginning video.  This can be practiced by itself.  The tai chi form was different than many I've seen so even if you own several, it's not likely to be a repeat.  Normally I just loathe going through the instructional part because it takes so long.  The instructional part on this dvd is only 20 minutes long and has a nice momentum so I feel fine about staying with that part until I feel firm enough to move to the flow.  With that said, I think that this dvd is fine if you already understand the basics of tai chi such as turning, weight shifting, stance, breathing, etc.  He is explicit enough in his instruction to follow but it's just so much easier if you have some prior background.
Music and scenery are soothing.  I love mirror image!  I don't get the problem with it.  And yes, there is some new agey rhetoric but that's hard to avoid with qigong.
