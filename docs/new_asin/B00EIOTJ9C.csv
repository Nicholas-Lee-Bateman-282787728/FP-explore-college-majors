I originally bought this set to complete my Hitchcock collection a good ten years ago. Recently, I have attempted to buy individual movies for each of the ones in this set, and, so far, every single one I have bought has been below par, especially the silent films. Even the talkies have been only equally good at best. I highly recommend this set for those who wish to see Hitchcock's lesser known films.",1489536000,3,581,4.878787878787879

It may sound like a lot of films and it is, encompassing most, but not quite all, of Hitchcock's films made before he moved to the US. The problem is very poor quality of the source films used and of the transfers (more on this below).

This set It includes most of his eight surviving silent feature films (a ninth silent is considered lost). It's not too difficult to fill in the missing ones. Hitchcock's very early films, most notably the silents, are quite different from his later film, especially from his US era. A couple, such as The Lodger, a crime thriller, show hints and glimmers of the style that would begin to emerge recognizably with The 39 Steps and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The suspense and thrillers are the best among his earliest work. He didn't always have the complete directorial freedom he enjoyed later, either. Until he became a known entity with name recognition among the general public, he was a standard contract director making two or three films each year. The films in this set are not considered his best work, although The 39 Steps is often required viewing in cinema classes because it's considered the film with which he firmly established himself. From the film he made just before it, The Man Who Knew Too Much, through The Lady Vanishes (1938) are the very best of his UK era. Jamaica Inn (1939), his last film before moving to Hollywood and making Rebecca (1940), is an anomaly, mostly due to Charles Laughton's interference and demands as one of the producers, and is considered by many to be his worst movie (including Hitchcock himself), in spite of its box office success.

I didn't expect extensive restoration. However, the transfers look as if they were resurrected from VHS tape archives and the source films used were in hideous condition. The result is so blurry that it's difficult to read hand written or typewritten notes when they're shown on camera for the audience to read. At times it takes pausing the playback for a minute or two to decipher them - and it's not the old style cursive either. Intertitles are big enough print and bold enough that they're OK. An immense amount of detail is lost and it makes these almost painful to watch. By comparison I've got another set of five films that includes one missing from this (why I bought it), and its transfers are much crisper and cleaner.

This set will suffice to fulfill my goal of watching all of Hitchcock's work (minus the two lost silents), but I consider it temporary until I can find decent DVD and Blu-ray transfers of the films in this set that I don't have on other (much better) discs. My advice is skipping this and the other couple of cheap 20 film sets that have similar remarks about poor transfers. Build your library with better DVD and Blu-ray transfers. They'll be much easier and more enjoyable to watch.",1471392000,5,2932,4.602294455066922

These twenty movies have a few silent films from the 1920s. Some are found on other collections (such as those 50 pack collections). All are in monochrome. Silent movies (#) were made before 1929, the newer ones also have higher quality. Disc 1 has two 25 minute episodes from his 1950's TV show. Some of these older movies have a loss of video quality; they have an organic base that ages. Hitchcock could scare an audience but reassure them it would turn out alright.

The 39 Steps came from a famous novel by John Buchan (who had an interesting career). It pointed out that Britain was no longer isolated from the Continent. The plot was used a number of times (innocent man pursued by both the police and the criminals). One was called North by Northwest. The Man Who Knew Too Much was also reproduced. The last version (not by Hitchcock) was called Foul Play. Sabotage came from a novel by Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent. Europe then was threatened by terrorists bombs, much like today. The Secret Agent came from the novel Ashenden by Somerset Maugham.
