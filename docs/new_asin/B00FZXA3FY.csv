8619802,5,B00FZXA3FY,I volunteer at a US Park Service Historic Site and cook in the hearth kitchen and bake in the wood fired brick oven. I bought this set of DVD's to learn new recipes and techniques from the 18th Century. I think this is a sterling set of shows with a wealth of information of 18th Century cooking and food history. Loved it. Thank you.,1464825600,,334,4.234375

8619805,5,B00FZXA3FY,"Chef Walter Staib has a hit in my opinion!  I have had the pleasure of eating at his restaurant (City Tavern) in Philadelphia, and I hoped this series would be helpful in recreating some of the recipes we enjoyed. It is that, but so much more!  Chef Staib's delightful, and enthusiastic personality adds an air of fun and excitement to these entertaining and educational shows. The field trips to historic sites, interviews with historians, and references to wonderful books of history really round out each episode. What a wonderful idea to combine gastronomy with history. I just love it!  I can't wait to get season 2!",1423958400,3,621,4.839622641509434
8619806,5,B00FZXA3FY,"I ordered this DVD after seeing only one episode on our PBS channel, because it was so interesting to watch the open hearth cooking. The quality is typical documentary style public programming, but I like the originality and how they sneak in early colonial American history lessons in a cooking show.",1402358400,8,301,4.921568627450981
