8675973,5,B00N37Q1VY,"This is a noir action thriller that rivals John Woo's The Killer.  While low-budget, the special effects are impressive, the acting is top-notch, and the cinematography is excellent.  Director Bennie Woodell's filmmaking gifts are evident in his shot selection and camera movement.  He is going to have a terrific career.  Actors Bradley Fowler and Katie Lanigan will also shine in future stage or film work.  If you love independent film, and want to support an up and coming director, purchase The Sad Cafe.  And for film lovers, try and catch the film references.",1420588800,,566,5.032258064516129
