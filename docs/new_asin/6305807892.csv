1079493,5,6305807892,Most science fiction movies depend on gimmicks and gadgets to keep the audience's attention.  This one depends on suspense.,1032652800,2,123,5.473684210526316
1079494,4,6305807892,"Something nasty comes out of a recent rent in the earth's crust, devastating isolated parts of England.  It appears to be at least semi-intelligent.  It moves around a bit, getting here and there and leaving some very unpleasant human wreckage in its wake.  Whatever the thing is, it burns  -  horribly.  It's intensely radioactive, literally able to melt a man down to the bone in seconds upon close contact.
American scientist Professor Royston (Dean Jagger) has a theory about it that no one is willing to endorse.  He thinks the thing is an animate pile of radioactive sludge from deep toward the centre of the Earth, come up to feed on more energy  -  and grow.
The only flaw with this otherwise stellar horror film is the premise of intelligent mud as a menacing monster, which is frankly pretty ridiculous.  But it's to the movie's credit that you cheerfully suspend your disbelief, to wallow in the sheer nasty thrill of it all.  This is one of Hammer Studio's best low-budget black-and-white shockers, which works more due to the remarkable conviction of its cast  -  including small roles played by Anthony Newley and Leo McKern  -  than anything else.
Anything else but the effects, that is, which are...gruesome.  Really, really gruesome.
Not as slick, smooth, or intelligently scripted as Nigel Kneale's Quatermass series, which it seeks to imitate (and for the most part does, quite well), but damned close.  Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster is another old hand in the business, and it shows.",1022457600,8,1501,4.916334661354582
1079495,5,6305807892,"A studio usually known for its horror fare, Hammer Studios nevertheless turned out quite a few intelligent science fiction films in the Fifties and Sixties. And this film is no exception. The film stars Dean Jagger(British films of the fifties usually placed an American in the lead to assuage the American audience)as a nuclear scientist called in by the British Army to investigate a strange outbreak of radiation, and the resultant death of a soldier, in an abandoned Scottish gravel pit. The mystery builds from there as more people are killed by this strange force or creature. With the help of a young Leo McKern as a government investigator, Jagger is able to identify and eventually destroy the creature.
As with most sci-fi films of its time, most of the characters of ""X the Unknown"" are familiar territory. Jagger, the renegade (of sorts) scientist working at a government nuclear facility where he clashes with the bureaucratic director (a fine Edward Chapman). Jagger is working on an outside experiment to defuse radioactivity through the use of sound, a project the director frowns upon, especially since there is plenty of official work to be done. The F/X is also primitive; as with most of its other Fifties breathren ""X the Unknown"" works best when the monster is not seen.
Then why recommend this film so highly? Simple. Given the limitations of special efects and budgets in those days, the emphasis had to be more on the script, characters and acting. And this is what ""X the Unknown"" has in abundance. The script is taut and intelligent, the characters well drawn, even though they are stock characters at base. The chemistry between Jagger and McKern is especially good and adds to our enjoyment of ther proceedings. And watch for the young Anthony Newley and Ian MacNaughton (who would later gain fame as the director for the Monty Python television show)as British soldiers in a bit of comic relief.
The DVD transfer is excellent and a documentary of British science fiction films is an added plus. If you love science fiction films, this one is a can't miss. Especially if you remember seeing it on television as a child.",1021680000,6,2148,4.887671232876713

Later in the movie, it is discovered that the source of the radiation is some creature, basically made of mud, which has been living inside the earth since it's beginning. Dean Jagger is the scientist that believes that something is seriously wrong and it is interesting how quickly he comes up with a ""mud"" monster. There are some good horror scenes (e.g., melting people), and suspenseful areas (e.g., when the little girl is outside the church). This is a movie worth getting.",1004227200,4,602,4.798076923076923

1079619,5,6305807892,"Originally envisioned as a film sequel to ""The Quatermass Xperiment"", Hammer couldn't get the rights to use the Quatermass character this time so they just changed the character's name and did the film anyway. Although Hammer did do a Quatermass sequel the following year called ""Quatermass 2"". Even though ""X: The Unknown"" wasn't written by Nigel Kneale or based on one of his Quatermass stories, it is a very eerie and suspenseful film with a good plot, good directing, good special effects, and some really good actors. It also features an early appearance by Fraser Hines who would later play Jamie McCrimmon on ""Doctor Who"".

The Plot:

During a routine military drill in a muddy quarry a horrifying discovery is made - a sinister radioactive creature from the center of the Earth. As the creature grows in size, and claims more and more victims, melting away their skin, it's up to Professor Royston to find a way of killing this seeming indestructible force before it annihilates mankind from the face of the planet.

1079620,3,6305807892,"X-THE UNKNOWN is a low-budget film from Excelsior (the precursor of Hammer) which was clearly designed to cash in on the success of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT (1953).  With the obligatory American star, designed with foreign sales in mind (Dean Jagger), the action derives much of its interest from the way in which it contrasts the mundane life of a remote Scottish village with the abnormal forces operating within it.

Life proceeds as normal - apparently.  A group of National Service recruits are engaged in a routine exercise; the locals happily drink at the local pub; while two young scallywags (Michael Brooke, Fraser Hines) go out late at night to cause mischief.  However none of them are quite prepared for the shock of encountering the 'thing' that feeds on energy, and appears to be resistant to any human attempts to repress it.

The film gains much of its force from the contrast between such shocking events and the matter-of-fact way in which they are investigated.  Leo McKern turns in an urbane performance as Inspector 'Mac' McGill, who maintains his sang-froid while people around him are becoming more and more hysterical with fear.  Together with Dr. Royston (Jagger), he patiently tries to solve the mystery of what happens.

In sociological terms, X THE UNKNOWN makes some trenchant points about the destructive effects of scientific discovery.  If Royston had not decided to practice his experiments in the area, perhaps the Scottish village might have been spared.  The point is trenchantly made by Jack Harding (Jameson Clark), after learning that his son Willie has died as a result of an encounter with the terror.

Shot in atmospheric black-and-white on a low budget, Norman's film gains much of its force from the way it shows how people are affected by the terror within their midst. Making clever use of reaction-shots and atmospheric music, it is definitely worth a look.",1412467200,,1906,5.038216560509555
1079621,3,6305807892,"This is also a Hammer Films production. The movie starts with an army exercise--soldiers practice using Geiger counters on the moor. The last soldier testing his skill discovers an unexpected radiation source in the field. Soon a minor earthquake opens up a small fissure that belches flames and radiation, burning two of the soldiers. The army calls on some local scientists to investigate.

The local science research station has (among other scientists) Dr. Adam Royston. He is studying radiation and hoping to discover ways to neutralize it. He comes to the moor and realizes there's a lot more than just a radiation release going on. He speculates that there might be creatures within the earth's crust that feed off energy and have been forced to the surface to seek new sources, like radioactive materials stored at the scientific facility.

The story is interesting, especially the use of science to fight the threat rather than brute force. At one point, the army decides to torch and bomb the fissure, followed with a thick layer of cement to keep it shut. This doesn't work out as the creature just breaks through the concrete in search of more sustenance. The science is a little dated but interesting enough and plausible enough to keep the story going.

Royston is an interesting character--smart but also concerned about others. His son works at the station and often does menial tasks, though he does step up when he needs to. Other cast members are nicely drawn and make the drama more compelling. The monster isn't so scary once we finally see it but it isn't terrible either.",1382227200,,1594,4.896296296296296

I was particularly chilled by one seen in which a doctor, being attacked by this ooze from hell, is killed by its radiological effects, and the flesh is simply melted of his skull, leaving behind only the white bone beneath.  By today's standard a cheap effect, but not too shabby in the 1960s.
The film is B&W and stark, and atmospheric.  The monster here is a mud-like creature from deep inside the earth, which seeks out radioactive matter to sustain itself.

1079695,1,6305807892,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,23,1640,4.592465753424658
1079696,4,6305807892,"X THE UNKNOWN holds a special place in my movie pantheon because of all the horror/sci-fi movies I saw as a kid, this one scared me the most. It contains at least three scenes that were absolutely terrifying to a child back in the early 1960s. 1) A young boy comes face to face with the monster and all we see are his horrified reactions to what he sees. 2) A doctor in a hospital literally melts before our eyes. 3) The badly burned body of a soldier is found stuffed in a fissure (that face used to haunt me when I was trying to fall asleep). The creature itself didn't bother me although the Geiger counter sound that accompanied it did. The music is very PSYCHO like (creepy strings) but this was 4 years earlier so Bernard Herrmann must have seen this film. Unlike so many of the films from that era though, X still delivers the goods though obviously not in the same way.

Hammer Films, who had yet to make their color Dracula and Frankenstein films, intended this to be a third Quatermass film (after THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT and QUATERMASS 2) but it didn't pan out. Dean Jagger was brought in to replace Brian Donlevy and Jimmy Sangster wrote the script instead of Nigel Kneale. This time the threat comes not from Outer Space but from within the Earth. The performances are low key and effective, the black and white photography is crisp and atmospheric, and the music adds to the intensity. While not as highly regarded as the two QUATERMASS films, I have always found X to be a better movie in virtually every department but, as always, it's a matter of opinion. Anchor Bay originally released this as a quality DVD back in 2000 and then on a double bill with THE FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE. Now they have it as a DVD-R. Make sure you check which one it is before purchasing especially if your DVD player is sensitive to the latter.",1258156800,,1836,4.448071216617211

1079699,4,6305807892,"For sheer mood, this one is a Fifties Sci-Fi classic, comparable to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and I say that even if the ""monster"" here might merely seem a radioactive rip-off of The Blob. X the Unknown is from the British Hammer Studios, and was created by some of the same people who worked on that studio's Quatermass series (itself a pretty memorable series of films.)
The film starts in a bleak location- an icy moor in Scotland- where some soldiers are practicing finding a radioactive source. Turns out there are TWO radioactive ""sources"" there, one of which creates a Y-shaped fissure in the ground (and manages to kill one soldier in the process.) We don't see the creature itself for some time (which helps build suspense), but we see the results of its presence - including the melting of the flesh off a hospital radiation therapy technician. (Some of the scenes here shook me up when I first looked at this film as a child- this was one of them.)
This is a film that would never have worked as well if it had been shot in color - or in daylight. With the exception of the opening segment, almost none of the scenes happen during the day. This allows the ""monster"" to catch victims unawares time and time again (though, interestingly, it may not even be ""conscious"" of the existence of humans at all- we just get in its way.) Two other scenes are pretty haunting- the fate of two soldiers guarding the crack in the earth where the creature lives, and most of all the descent of one of the characters into the monster's lair to verify its existence.
OK, it might be a bit too convenient that the film's scientist-hero, Dr. Alan Royston (Dean Jagger) just happens to have been working on a device for eliminating radiation- the very thing for dealing with a monster that is basically radioactive mud. And there is an occasional tendency to deal with philosophical issues in a simplistic stereotyped manner (the Quatermass films had the same problem.) But on the whole I'm struck by the sheer atmosphere of the film (one critic said it was ""gloomy"", and what kind of mood would be more appropriate for a horror film?) And if the monster seems silly, I might point out that there has been speculation that the earliest form of life on Earth might have been type of clay. So maybe not quite so far-fetched as it seems, and maybe still a good film to give a kid nightmares.",1237593600,4,2385,4.561771561771562

1079701,3,6305807892,"Hammer continued their fine triumvirate of monochrome science-fiction pictures with X the Unknown. Although this has somewhat been overshadowed by the films it was jammed in between - QUATERMASS 2 and CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN it still retains enough to interest any fan of the genre. It is important for marking the first major contribution to the world of Hammer for Jimmy Sansgter, who would go on to write some of their most famous films as well as direct three in the early 1970's. Like most Sangster screenplays it borrows liberally from other areas, most notably in this case from Nigel Kneale and his Quatermass series and it is also quite light on actual narrative. However a number of relevant cultural concerns form the basis of the film; the fear of radiation, the fear of the atomic bomb and the fear of science in general. The dichotomy between military might and scientific reason is also played out, and some scenes are rather reminiscent of Doctor Who's regular conflicts with the Brigadier and UNIT. Science and mankind have created the threat (which is basically primordial radioactive mud) and science also succeeds in vanquishing the threat. The mistrust and paranoia of progress and science had yet to strike in British cinema, but the other regular target of Hammer authority and bureaucracy are once again highlighted as being inefficient barriers to our expert hero. The token American lead this time is Dean Jagger, who is actually very good. Perhaps not Hammer's most memorable film, but great fun nonetheless",1156809600,2,1532,5.035433070866142
1079702,4,6305807892,"X - The Unknown (1957) is a superior science fiction/horror film from Hammer Studios.  The film stars Dean Jagger, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for the film 12 O'Clock High, as Dr. Adam Royston, Leo Mckern as Inspector McGill, and Edward Chapman as John Elliot, director of the atomic plant where Royston works.

The movie takes place in Scotland, and starts off showing a group of army men in training on locating radioactive material using a Geiger counter.  Soon a fissure cracks open in the Earth, and a couple of the men suffer radiation burns.  Royston is called in to try and determine the source of the radiation, but he has no answers.  Soon, others begin to suffer from such burns, and radioactive materials go missing from various locations like the local hospital and Royston's secluded lab.  Royston develops a theory, one too fantastic to be believed, but one that's soon proved correct to everyone's horror.  Seems a creature of energy has risen from deep within the Earth, one that can kill instantly, and needs radioactive materials to feed on to survive.  Essentially, it's a giant ball of mud, one that continues to grow the more it feeds.  How do you kill a ball of mud?  Royston has an idea, but the cure may prove to be worse than the disease as destroying the creature may cause an explosion of atomic proportions.

Dean Jagger is the star, no doubt about that, as he shows it throughout.  The rest of the actors, while very good, are pretty much along for the ride.  One of the best elements about this film is the intelligent story line.  The creature isn't even show until about an hour into the proceedings, but the viewer's attention is kept tightly focused as the suspense builds and the story unfolds.  And I have to say, the effects were quite good and even a bit more graphic than I would have expected, especially the scenes where some poor unfortunate comes into contact with the creature.  Think of what happened to Toht, the character played by Ron Lacey, at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and you'll understand what I mean.

The picture provided on this disc looks very good, with minimal signs of deterioration in a few scenes.  Special features include an original trailer for the film, and a World of Hammer episode entitled Sci-Fi.  Also included in the case is a reproduction of a promotional poster for the film.  All in all, an excellent example of early British sci-fi that's intelligent, suspenseful, and extremely well made.
