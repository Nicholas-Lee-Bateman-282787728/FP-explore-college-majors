5277418,1,B0098TNDG2,So Boring :/,1462752000,,12,3.3333333333333335
5277419,5,B0098TNDG2,"Picked this up, not knowing what to expect wanting a family video both kids would enjoy. I have got to say, both kids laughed out loud- they never do. Most movies also do not keep their attention for more than 30 minutes- they watched the whole thing. The animation was cute and there was a great message.",1380240000,3,305,4.368421052631579
5277420,1,B0098TNDG2,"This movie is terrible. The animation is distractingly bad, and jarring to watch. The voice acting is consistently whiney, and the story depressing. Unfortunately our 2.5 year old likes it. I would avoid this movie altogether and get something else.",1370908800,2,249,5.25
5277421,3,B0098TNDG2,"I really didn't like that they said, ""Oh my God!"" Instead of ""Oh my gosh!"" I JUST got my 4 year old into the habit of ""Oh my gosh,"" and I am afraid that it will set her back. I actually think the animation looks more like claymation (but done in 3D). I didn't have a huge problem with the graphics/animation so much as the really bad dialogue/story line. My kids seem to like it, but I wasn't as pleased. I am glad we rented it from Redbox first!",1370908800,2,446,4.022471910112359
5277422,5,B0098TNDG2,"My grandson (4 yrs) loved this.  Again, blah, blah blah, too many word requirements in this form, now I'm done",1357516800,,110,4.5
5277423,2,B0098TNDG2,"The animation is choppy (it's like they only animate every 3rd frame, or something, and gives somewhat of an old stop motion animation feel that's not endearing) and sloppy (they wave a bag of flour at a character, and then poof, there's magically flour on their face!).  The voice acting is poor, and at times emotionless.  In addition, one of the characters says ""oh my God""(whereas most kid shows will substitute the euphemistic ""oh my gosh"", which they also say several times).  Save your money and watch it free on a streaming service.  But beware, despite all of these flaws your children may fall in love with it, requesting to watch it over and over like my 3 year old does, so you may just want to stay away in the first place.",1355788800,5,736,4.511278195488722

5277433,5,B0098TNDG2,My three year old grandson loved it.  The characters were unusual so he asked a lot of questions and once he knew what all the animals were he really got into the story. So I guess you say curiosity is what held his attention.,1477526400,4,226,4.136363636363637

5277440,1,B0098TNDG2,"I didn't appreciate the bad behavior in this movie. Not appropriate for preschoolers. It claims to be a movie of acceptance, but the characters emulated a intolerable behavior.",1468540800,,176,5.321428571428571
5277441,1,B0098TNDG2,"The absolute worst animated children's movie I have ever seen. The title did not relate to the theme or content of the movie, which was extremely disjointed.

5277455,2,B0098TNDG2,We turned it off just a few minutes into it. It was so strange like toy stuffed animals. I can't even remember the few minutes we watched just that I had no desire to watch the rest.,1466380800,,182,3.945945945945946

Unfortunately, my K-drama loving 1yo was bored after 30 minutes. My 7yo was begging me to switch to ""anything else"" 10 minutes later.
