7855189,5,6303911609,"I bought this VHS for my son's 50th birthday because he has been a big Brave's fan all his life--even all the way back to the days of Dale Murphy. I don't know who was the biggest fan of the Braves back in the 90's, me or my son. Anyway, he no longer has a VHS player, most people don't any more, most everyone now has DVD players. So I had this VHS tape converted into a DVD so he could have it and watch it. I have not given it to him yet but I watched this video myself--twice! So many scenes I remembered while  watching this video and I still got chill bumps all over again as if it were just happening. And of course, I cried again when the Braves won the 95 World Series--finally the Braves won it all! Even though the video inferred how Atlanta was the most joyous over the Brave's win I don't think that is exactly fair--I think all of Georgia stood up and cheered!

One thing I really liked about this video that you probably did not see on TV was a lot of interviews with the Braves' team. I loved seeing some of the players that were on the the team but we don't hear about any more.

If you are a true Braves' fan, you will love this video. It has a lot of heart stopping scenes and puts you right back in that time and era & you'll find your self pulling for the Braves all over again! I only wished that they had a video out that has the whole 1995 series--or at least the whole game of the last game that that gave them the World Series. Have looked for a video like that for years. If anyone knows where I might find a video of the last game of the 1995 World Series, please post it in the comments for me. I would be forever thankful to you.
Thank you,
