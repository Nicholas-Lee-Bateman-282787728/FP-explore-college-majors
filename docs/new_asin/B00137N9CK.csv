8249428,4,B00137N9CK,"This 22-minute VHS video (leader guide included) shows people stuck in everyday conflicts how to use a four step conflict resolution procedure to reach a solution--1. focus on the problem, not the person; 2. look for things you can both agree on; 3. think of options you both like; and 4. stay objective.  Several scenarios are performed in which the above confict resolution strategies are demonstrated.  Reggie's girlfriend accuses her of breaking a borrowed item and her boyfriend dumps her just before the big dance.  Sam faces a disagreeable boss when he tries to get off work to attend a wedding.  Bill has a motorcycle that stalls out and all the dealer offers is sympathy because the warranty just ran out.  Mark wants the family car to go to a dance.  All four characters first learn to focus on the problem, not the person, and see conflicts from the other person's point of view.  They learn to avoid blaming and accusing others, treat the other person with respect even  though they disagree, and look for solutions that they can both be comfortable with.  The leader guide includes discussion activities and role-playing suggestions.",1223683200,,1146,4.927083333333333
