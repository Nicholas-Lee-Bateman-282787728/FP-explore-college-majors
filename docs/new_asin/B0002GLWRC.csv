8027910,5,B0002GLWRC,Our family grew up watching Red Grammer and were so excited to find a newer video of him doing some of his classics.  Would love to see more videos.  He really engages his audience and the messages of his songs are very important for children to hear.,1386115200,,251,4.319148936170213
8027911,5,B0002GLWRC,"Red Grammar's music is wonderful for kids.  I had videos of it for my kids and am now introducing my grandkids to it.  Upbeat and uplifting, it's catchy and fun with many great messages for kids to absorb.",1378425600,,205,4.368421052631579
8027912,5,B0002GLWRC,"Nothing beats Red Grammer when he is live in concert.  This DVD is the next best thing, and includes shots of the audience as they participate.  Children will love the songs and fun sign language/word play/hand gestures.  Songs are expertly written with such things as being thankful, appreciating diversity, social skills, and global citizenship.

I keep two copies of this DVD at home because friends who watch it at my house love it so much, I end up lending it out or giving it as a parting gift.

Great for English language learners!!",1287878400,,539,4.752688172043011
8027913,5,B0002GLWRC,"This is a great kids' music video with sign language and other interactive parts (movements and sounds to repeat).  Unlike most music for kids, this won't grate on an adult's nerves or get stuck in the head too badly.  The music is enjoyable and the themes of being kind to others and of world citizenship are excellent but not overstated.  The performance is fun, even after seeing it more than 20 times.",1133913600,5,405,4.597222222222222
