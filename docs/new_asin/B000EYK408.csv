8115822,5,B000EYK408,"A must for Houdini fans.  See Bess Houdini, Harry's widow, in a cool film that debunks mystics!  Atmospheric with a sense of humor, this film exposes the spiritualists and seance racket.  DVD is typical dupey, PD quality.

8115823,5,B000EYK408,"Sure, the film is awful, but it is the ONLY sound footage of Bess Houdini in existence. That makes this a pretty important piece of magic history and a must buy for Houdini buffs. Also just interesting to see a true ""indie"" movie from this time period. I'm very happy to see it available on DVD.",1374278400,2,295,4.285714285714286
8115824,1,B000EYK408,"A good plot wasted in this film. Madame Houdini was a laugh, the cast was awful, the plot meandered, and I wasted a Saturday night watching this this film.  DON'T BUY THIS FILM EVEN AS A CURIOURSITY.  YOU'LL BE SORRY.",1223683200,4,217,4.4
