367644,4,630179849X,"I'll make this short and sweet. Lobo has an affectionate place in my heart. Yes it's the third time we've seen this movie, Bravo and El Dorado are basically the same thing, except they're better overall. BUT, Lobo is so much damn fun. I used to watch it with my grandfather and we'd die laughing at many of the film's fine comedic elements. Jennifer O'Neill is awful, but so cute, Elam is fine as usual, Victor French is slightly wasted but also good - etc. etc. Duke is... well playing a part he could do in his sleep, but he is none the less likable and funny ""don't say COMFORTABLE"". And the true star of the film is without doubt, Jerry Goldsmith's score. It only clocks in at around 40 minutes worth of music. BUT, oh what a great 40 minutes they are. For Jerry's score and the film's wonderful comedic underpinnings, I have no choice but to say it's a keeper!",1091318400,7,865,4.345679012345679
367645,3,630179849X,"OK, it's not the best western ever produced. It's more of a full color film in the style of the old Republic westerns of the 30s and 40s. What it does have is a pretty fast moving story line, scene stealing character actors, and very pretty music (except for Jack Elam's mouth harp...).

Rio Lobo begins with probably the most original opening sequence in a movie.  The solo guitarist plays a beautiful tune, while we watch his fingers from in front of and from inside the guitar.  Totally cool and absolutely amazing.  Sometimes, I watch the movie just to see this sequence.

John Wayne is moving from leading man with love interest to lovable old coot. Jorge Rivera takes over as the hunk. This is early in his acting career and very early in his English, but he's a doll to look at and OBTW, he does an outstanding leap over a fence. Christopher Mitchum looks very much like his father, and the chemistry between him and Wayne is similar to that of his father and Wayne (see Bob in El Dorado and Chris later in Big Jake).

This was Jennifer O'Neill's fourth movie, and it shows. But Wayne was famous for introducing new actors, even when it was clear they needed practice. Must have been because of the way Wayne himself was mentored in the 30s by John Ford, et. al. Watch his early work and see his own improvement.

Sherry Lansing was sexy and later vengeful. In the latter role, she, too, chewed up the scenery. She could have had a respectable acting career, but chose to shatter the movie mogul glass ceiling instead, and more power to her.

Then there are the scene stealers. David Huddleston can steal one just by being in it. Victor French is both scary and a coward simultaneously, a hard combination, but he can certainly pull it off. Hank Worden only had one scene, but he's as neat as ever. And finally, Jack Elam was a scenery chewing, crazy eyed loonie, with some of the funniest lines in the whole movie.

No, it's not the best, but I like it. It will always be in my personal movie stash.",1054944000,11,2007,4.446866485013624
367646,4,630179849X,"Rio Lobo is a good John Wayne western that borrows from several of his previous movies.  The story is about a Union colonel trying to find out who the traitor was in his unit that sold information about gold shipments to Confederate guerillas.  Along the way he helps a town escape the wrath of a rich landowner and a corrupt sheriff.  The story may seem similar, but this still is a very entertaining movie.  What John Wayne movie isn't?  The story blends action and story together in this exciting western.
  The Duke is great once again as Cord McNally, the Union colonel in pursuit of traitors.  Jorge Rivero is awkward as Pierre ""Frenchy"" Cordona, the Confederate guerilla who helps Wayne.  I don't know whether it is actually Rivero talking or someone dubbing his lines in, but it just sounds funny.  Joining them are Jennifer O'Neill, Christopher Mitchum, Jack Elam, and Victor French.  Elam is great as usual in his role as the eccentric old man in the town.  The DVD has a good widescreen presentation that looks cleaned up compared to the one shown on TBS.  Otherwise, there isn't any extras added on.  This was Howard Hawks last western, and he made a good one.  Good story and exciting action.  Deserves a watch if nothing else for those who haven't seen this late Duke western!",1053820800,73,1290,4.666666666666667
367647,4,630179849X,"Howard Hawk's swansong is a good one.  The train robbery at the beginning of the movie is exceptionally done, and it gets this film off to a fast start.  It sags a bit in the middle, but is bolstered by the comic performance of Jack Elam, who is downright hilarious.  Great gunfight at the end.  Supporting actors are OK, but could have been a whole lot better.  You couldn't find two more beautiful women than Jennifer O'Neill and Sherry Lansing, and they certainly add to the dynamics of the movie.
Duke, as usual, delivers a fine performance.  The similarities in plot line to El Dorado and Rio Bravo are obvious, but Hawks again does a very nice job.  Jack Elam's character really saves this movie, though, because the middle is downright slow.  Overall, not John Wayne's best, but good.",1012953600,9,791,4.640287769784172
367648,3,630179849X,"Though partially cut from the same cloth as ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado,"" Howard Hawks' ""Rio Lobo"" (1970) remains a solid Western and a fitting end to the veteran director's career. With a ""comfortable"" John Wayne back in the saddle, the film is highlighted by impressive action sequences and splendid comic relief from Jack Elam. Apart from Jorge Rivero (who establishes a nice rapport with the Duke), the younger actors are a bit weak . . . and it's a shame that Robert Mitchum was unable to co-star with Wayne as originally planned. ""Rio Lobo"" may not represent Hawks' best work, but it's a lot of fun.",1002153600,14,604,4.654205607476635
367649,5,630179849X,"This movie is hardcore John Wayne at his finest, and terribly authentic. The movie begins with Union Colonel Wayne nervous (with good reason) about a gold shipment during the latter stages of the civil war. He is only nervous about sending it through territory where he knows the famous 1st Louisiana Cavalry is lurking. What follows is absolutely the greatest train robbery in movie history in my opinion. You are left breathless when the hornet nest is sent flying into the boxcar holding the gold. Then John Wayne picks up the chase. Great photography, and it posesses all the ear marks of a Wayne-Hawks western. The plot later in the movie follows along the same lines as previous Wayne-Hawks classics ""Rio Bravo"" and ""Eldorado"". Do yourself a favor and add this one to your western collection.",996019200,47,798,4.875
367650,1,630179849X,"The opening sequence in RIO LOBO -- the hi-jacking of a Union train during the Civil War -- is a very well done set-piece. However, from there on, this film becomes an embarrassment. It is truly awful! Poorly written,  acted, directed. George Plimpton, who had a bit role in it, had the best  comment: I didn't have the faintest idea what it was about. That's because  it wasn't about anything, George.",954979200,5,402,4.633802816901408

Unfortunately, the Confederates are also expecting this shipment and get to it first.  Finders keepers!  McNally heads out in hot pursuit and is handily captured by the gold thieving Confederates.  One good trick deserves another as McNally leads them north to be captured by Union soldiers.  Flash forward to the end of the war, McNally wants the ex-Confederates help when he realizes they were getting inside information on gold shipments from a traitor in the Union.  No hard feelings, they join forces to track down the traitor(s).  This leads them to a hotbed of corruption in Rio Lobo.  Shootouts required, old coot (the incomparable Jack Elam) optional.

The only failing in this film is some of the odd casting choices in supporting roles (critics excoriated the performances of Christopher Mitchum, Jorge Rivero, and Jennifer ONeill).  In general, critics at the time disliked this film.",1466035200,,1007,5.042424242424242

367854,2,630179849X,"I love John Wayne movies. I have many on DVD and watch them regularly. But this one is just not a good movie for a couple of reasons. First, it is a poor attempt at a remake of Rio Bravo. It is futile to try and capture the magic of Rio Bravo and even its original creator, Howard Hawks, couldn't pull it off. Second Jennifer O,Neil puts on a terrible performance. In every one of her scenes all I see is an actress trying to play a role. Never once does she potray a believable character to me. She is certainly beautiful and has done some good work in other films but in Rio Lobo she bites the big one. Without her it would still not be of the same caliber of Rio Bravo but it would be a good picture. How can it not be with John Wayne's talent? But Jennifer's performance ruins it for me.",1453593600,,791,4.044585987261146

367864,5,630179849X,"Rio Lobo was a John Wayne classic. It was great because of the characters and the humor. As for characters, Wayne was excellent. He was the sort of character I would hope to see after watching Rooster Cogburn. He was older, but still plenty tough and willing to take care of justice. Shasta Delaney, the girl with the snake-oil wagon, was good, too. She and Wayne had a good rapport. The minor characters were quite entertaining as well. Then there was the humor. It was subtle, so I cant say much about it other than it worked. This is the kind of movie I could watch again in the near future.

367870,4,630179849X,"Sometime during the Civil War, a unit of Confederate Cavalry, led by Mexican/French New Orleanian Capt. Pierre Cardona (Jorge Rivera) and his top sergeant Tuscarora Phillips (Christopher Mitchum), creatively hijacks a Union payroll off a train--and, in the process, causes the death of a young lieutenant (Peter Jason), thereby bringing down upon themselves the wrath of Col. Cord McNally (John Wayne), who ""watched [him] grow up.""  But while McNally does succeed in running them down, he's really more interested in finding out how they've known which trains to hit.  At war's end, he reconnects with them as they're being released from POW camp and asks them to contact him if they ever re-encounter the nameless Yank who tipped them off.  An unknown length of time passes, and McNally, now a civilian, hears from Cardona, who's heard from Tuscarora--one of the Yanks has turned up in his part of Texas.  On their way there, McNally and Cardona find that very Yank trying to arrest a young woman, Shasta Delaney (Jennifer O'Neill), and a gunfight ensues.  From there, Shasta and all, it's on to Rio Lobo, where they discover that the dead Yank worked for a man named Ketcham (Victor French), who seems to be trying to acquire everything in sight--including the small ranch owned by the cantankerous oldster (Jack Elam) who brought Tuscarora up, in pursuit of which his tame sheriff, Tom Hendricks (Mike Henry), has put the ex-sergeant in jail for stealing his own horses.  Now it's up to McNally, Cardona, Phillips, and Shasta, helped by Tuscarora's Mexican girlfriend Maria Carmen (Susana Dosamantes) and her neighbor Amelita (Sherry Lansing), to get Tuscarora out of jail, capture Ketcham, and eliminate Hendricks and his coterie of gunmen.

This is the third remake of the story Wayne and director Howard Hawks told in ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado,"" and while it doesn't measure up to either of its predecessors, it still has its moments, particularly the hijack of the pay train and the characters of Cardona and Phillips.  There's also an intriguing mystery to McNally: he's clearly familiar with Texas (he knows that Blackthorne is ""near your Rio Lobo country"") and apparently spent some time trying to lay hands on Hendricks before the war (was he a Ranger, or just an Army officer?).  Wayne's showing his age but still makes his character unforgettable.",1442793600,,2361,5.033333333333333

367982,2,630179849X,"John Wayne is my favorite actor, even though he couldn't convincingly play anything except an aloof hard-nosed do-gooder.  That said, this ranks as one of the worst of his later career.  And it has nothing to do with the story, which is serviceable, if somewhat predictable, having seen as many Wayne movies as I have.  The problem is with the rest of the cast.

Scott Eyman, in his recent biography of Wayne has a line that's relevant here. It is in reference to Hatari, but he says that at this point in his career, Howard Hawks, the director, always had ""one new wrinkle that would be present in all of his later picture; beautiful young women who couldn't act.""  Nothing could be truer about this particular film.  Jennifer O'Neill did do other movies after this, so SOMEONE must have thought she could act, but her performance in this movie is absolutely horrific.  I swear sometimes I think I see an incredulous look on the Duke's face when he is in a scene with her.

Not much better is Jorge Rivero as a Confederate soldier.  (A Mexican is an officer in the Confederate Army?  Really?)  Here's another actor who had a career after this movie, although mostly in Spanish language flicks, so i never saw any of them.  Christopher Mitchum, as his second-in-command is better.  At least I can see a glimmer of talent there.  Victor French, who had a thriving career with Michael Landon on Little House on the Prairie and Highway to Heaven is not onscreen long enough to see if he had a bad turn on this movie.

All in all, its still entertaining, if you can get past the horrible acting.  Too bad Howard Hawks, who had a great career with some excellent movies had to go out on such a sour note.  (this was his last movie).",1409356800,,1727,4.501607717041801

The problem is with the cheap stamping of the dvd itself. 3/4 of the way through the movie it started acting up and then wouldn't play at all. Wouldn't you know it? It was just when things were starting to ramp up towards the gun battle at the end. I could not find any visual defects on the disk itself. When I called Amazon I was surprised to find out that they have a 30 day return/reissue policy. We decided to stock up on 11 old John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies that will take us well over a year to watch. I hope there are no other defective disks. So I'm just returning this one, getting my money back, and not repurchasing it again for quite some time.",1408406400,,834,4.091463414634147

368062,1,630179849X,"Just plain terrible.  John Wayne was in his sixties by the time this monstrosity was hatched and he was plainly not up to it.  You feel sorry for the horse that was required to carry his bloated frame.  Director Howard Hawks was also in his dotage and had completely lost any sense of pacing or story.  The plot is a preposterous mishmash of Civil War and Texas western, and Wayne is cast as a Texan who somehow served as a Union officer and afterward turns his hometown frontier community upside down looking for pro-Confederate informers.  In real life, of course, Wayne's character would have been lynched on the spot in postwar Texas.  Supporting cast member Jorge Rivero is laughably bad; his fractured English couldn't even be saved in the dubbing studio.  He later turned up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the anticlassic ""Werewolf"".  Nor is Jennifer O'Neill any better.

After the war the colonel goes after the guy who sold him out. A couple of former Rebs need his help as a local land baron is trying to steal their land with the help of a corrupt sheriff. Turns out the land baron is the guy that sold out the gold shipment.

Jennifer O'Neil plays the come on girl for a snake oil salesman the sheriff murders. She does not do all that bad for having no experience what so over in acting.

The Duke and his pals deal with the bad guys in the usual way.

The movie borrows elements from other westerns the Duke did, but it is still the Duke at his finest.

1. Yankee and Confederates who end up fighting together after the war. (Just saw that one very recently in ""The Undefeated."")

2. Pretty girl who takes up with the young and handsome guy that Wayne is partnered with, and treats Wayne as a fatherly figure. (This is a later development, but it is in almost every one of his later films. Earlier they took up with Wayne himself.)

3. Old geezer who's too stubborn to sell out to or give in to the land-grabber who uses dirty tricks of various sorts to take over a whole town.

4. Corrupt sheriff who is in the pocket of said land-grabber.

5. Shoot-out in which Wayne's side is outnumbered considerably, but win because they are better shots and because they are clever and do something unexpected to foil the villains.

6. Holing up in the sheriff's office and/or jail, wherein at least one person, and probably several, call out ""You! In the jail!"" to get their attention so they can parley.

This one had a few original elements, but that could almost be number seven on the list, because none of the stories are really without original elements.

368151,4,630179849X,"I won't waste time reviewing the film, as most of you will have seen this countless times, and concentrate on the Blu Ray itself.

The picture:
The transfer is superb, far superior to the recent Horse Soldiers Blu Ray release, the picture is bright, rich and not overly sharpened. The blacks are pretty solid and the picture holds together in the dark passages, there is obvious grain in certain scenes but this should be expected due to the age of the film.

The sound:
5.1 surround on a John Wayne film! They've done a pretty good job on this, adding sound effects and splitting the soundtrack to give it a sense of space, the spurs literally jump out of the speakers and Jerry Goldsmith's score sounds superb! Don't expect this to be like a modern film, it's not true 5.1 but it does the job.

If only they could enhance the woeful acting by Jennifer O'Neil, however pretty she was I've see chairs with more talent, and a pretty poor effort by Jorge Rivero, the film would get 4 stars. Look out for Mike 'Tarzan' Henry as a sheriff!

All in all an excellent Blu Ray release which is encouraging for future John Wayne releases. 3 out of 5 for the film, taken up to 4 out of 5 as looks and sounds so, so good it actually enhances the watching experience.",1331337600,4,1255,4.396551724137931

368172,4,630179849X,"Once again the movies of John Wayne are slowly making their way onto blu-ray format. Perhaps not the most famous of those films but ones that continued to show why even during his later years Wayne continued to make westerns that could entertain.

RIO LOBO finds Wayne as Col. Cord McNally at the tail end of the Civil War. Waiting for a gold shipment he's disappointed when confederate soldiers led by Capt. Pierre Cardona (Jorge Rivero) drops a hornet's nest into the car containing the gold and soldiers and then cuts lose the train cars to steal the loot. A back and forth of who has whom results in Wayne capturing Cordona and his right hand man, Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips (Christopher Mitchum).

The years pass, the war ends and prisoners are set free. McNally meets up with Cordona and Phillips in search of information. He wants to find who it was that set up the train heist, who it was on his side that was feeding the south information. One of McNally's friends was killed in the attack, a killing he doesn't hold against his war time foes but does against a traitor. The three part ways on good terms giving McNally a little to go on but enough that months later he heads to Rio Lobo in search of the traitor.

On his way there he once again runs into Cordona. They also become acquainted with a young woman named Shasta (Jennifer O'Neill) fleeing Rio Lobo and hunted by three killers with badges. Needless to say they lose the ensuing gunfight and McNally discovers that not only has the traitor taken over the sheriff in Rio Lobo, he's about to put an end to Tuscarora and his family as well. The three set out for Rio Lobo to help and finally get the revenge that McNally sought to begin with.

So this is a later John Wayne film and one that did decent at the box office but also showed a decline in movie goer's enjoyment of westerns and Wayne as well. Sure it did good business but not what his earlier films did. But that doesn't take away the fact that this is an enjoyable film that the entire family can watch. There are a few violent moments that small children might not need to see (a woman shows the results of a facial slice made by bad guy Mike Henry as Rio Lobo's sheriff for hire) but it's far less graphic than even some TV shows today.

There is plenty of gun slinging and Wayne once more turns down the role of romantic lead, offering it to the younger Rivero instead. A smart move on his part as chances are ticket buyers would have had a hard time dealing with the older more mature Wayne hooking up with the much younger O'Neill.  There is more plot than usual for a western here between the civil war antics and the search for the traitor who sold out his fellow soldiers (played by Victor French long before his LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE days) but that just brings in more folks to help before the final gunfight.

Of interest to some would be the casting of two individuals in the film. The first is a bad guy, the initial three who come looking for O'Neill played almost silently by George Plimpton. Plimpton was a writer known for his taking on jobs to find out what they were like first hand. His claim to fame was writing the book PAPER LION where the lean and tall Plimpton spent time as a Detroit Lion football players to see what it was like. Here, he takes on the role of a stunt man. The second would be Sherry Lansing as Amelita. Lansing worked as an actress for some time before moving behind the camera and becoming not just a producer but the head of Paramount Studios for some time.

No, this is not John Wayne's best film nor would I consider it in the top ten. But it does offer a good western that you can kick back and enjoy. The blu-ray format does indeed help the quality of the picture and gives it that much newer feel and look. One can only hope that all of Wayne's films receive the same treatment down the line.",1306713600,2,3875,4.342541436464089
368173,4,630179849X,"John Wayne's back in the saddle and the world is okay. Demonstrating that director Howard Hawks isn't at all averse to lifting from his own material, this movie is the second remake of RIO BRAVO (after EL DORADO), and, let's not kid ourselves, it's the least version of all three flicks and the looser adaptation. It's not to say that RIO LOBO isn't a solid western, because it is. The story opens during the last days of the Civil War, as a gang of Confederate soldiers commit a daring train heist and make off with the Union Army's payroll. It's not their first time doing this. Union Army Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne) nabs the thieving Confederate leader, Captain Pierre Cordona (Jorge Rivero), and yet somehow a friendship is struck up. No hard feelings, then, especially when the war ends soon after.

Traitors within the Union Army had been feeding vital information to Captain Cordona, and it's these traitors for whom an incensed Colonel McNally is really gunning. The story picks up some time later as McNally, Cordona, and a spunky girl (Jennifer O'Neill) seeking retribution for her murdered friend converge at Rio Lobo, Texas. There, rough John Wayne justice awaits the Union traitors and the town's crooked sheriff and deputies.

You gotta love John Wayne's half-startled, half-exasperated double takes. He comes off as this still very capable man who is constantly bemused by those around him. It's a strong hint that your romantic leading man days are firmly in the rear view mirror when a sexy, young Jennifer O'Neill opts to share your sleeping blankets - instead of, say, the younger Rivero's - because, as she remarks: ""Well, you're older. You're comfortable."" The sub-text being: ""And you're too old to try any hanky panky."" 1970 finds John Wayne at his twilight, long past being spry. The ""comfortable"" line becomes a running gag in the film.

And yet, even at this stage, the Duke still had what it takes to sell a convincing action sequence. He never did lose that commanding screen presence. Jorge Rivero makes a good second banana, playing the dashing French-Mexican Confederate Captain. Jack Elam has the colorful Walter Brennan cranky old-timer role, and, by the way, I wouldn't be caught dead in a staring contest with Jack Elam. RIO LOBO also benefits from featuring three lovely actresses. Sherry Lansing has a near topless scene, and, for a Rated G flick, this scene is pretty steamy. And ""steamy"" is an adjective one rarely bandies about in a John Wayne film (maybe THE QUIET MAN). Anyway, RIO LOBO is an all too familiar oater. Jorge Rivero does fine, but the film suffers some from not having Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum (or, for that matter, Ricky Nelson or James Caan) in supporting roles. In my opinion, John Wayne may have taught himself to become a good actor, but he'd always been a great reactor. As such, he requires a certain caliber of stars to react to for him to really shine. As it is, RIO LOBO is watchable for having the Duke in it, even as aged and physically hampered (read: sick as a dog) and ""comfortable"" as he's gotten. Just now, I labeled RIO LOBO an ""all too familiar oater."" But sometimes what we need is the familiarity that only comfort food or your favorite chair or a John Wayne picture can deliver. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.",1304208000,,3301,4.7473867595818815

368176,4,630179849X,"Released in 1970, Howard Hawks' ""Rio Lobo"" starts with a thrilling Confederate train robbery of a Union gold shipment. After the war, Col. McNally (John Wayne) befriends Confederate Capt. ""Frenchie"" (Jorge Rivero) and his sergeant (Christopher Mitchum) to try to track down the Union traitors indirectly responsible for the gold robberies and the death of his close comrade and spiritual son. The trail leads to the West Texas town Rio Lobo and a showdown.

POSITIVES:

The opening credits features an exceptional two-guitar piece by Jerry Goldsmith with the camera zeroed-in closely on an acoustic guitar and the guitarist's hands. Sometimes I put the movie on just to see this part. The following half hour involves an excellent Confederate train robbery followed by the ensuing conflicts, which really make the film stand out from other Westerns. It's a great sequence, convincing and original. Civil War devotees should seek out ""Rio Lobo"" just for this.

Three notable women are featured: Jennifer O'Neill, Susana Dosamantes and Sherry Lansing, the latter of whom went on to became president of 20th Century-Fox and, later, chairman of Paramount Pictures (she's the scarred girl Wayne more or less rides off into the sunset with). I've heard jokes/comments over the years about the number of babes in the town of Rio Lobo, most single. But, really, there's only two in the town: Maria (Susan), who is seeing Frenchie's comrade (Mitchum), and Lansing, who isn't all that exceptional anyway; O'Neill was just passing through as part of some snake oil show.

The protagonists have good chemistry and camaraderie. The film was made right after the advent of the Spaghetti Western, which was known for amorality and lack of character depth. The protagonists in Italo Westerns were almost always antiheroes rather than heroes and caricatures rather than characters. They were grim, silent, one-dimensional killing machines, usually with dubious motivations (greed, revenge, lust) and just all-around comic-booky. While these types of characters are great when you're 13-20, they don't cut it when you're an adult and require more depth and realism. Don't get me wrong, the Spaghetti Westerns added (or perfected) a cool new style and grim sense of realism to the Western, but they accomplished this at the expense of morality, character depth and social realism. This explains why Clint Eastwood combined elements of both to forge the exceptional ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" in 1976 after the decline of the Italo Western. Needless to say, it's nice to have a group of likable characters in ""Rio Lobo"" that get along and for whom you can root.

An exceptional example of this good-natured camaraderie is shown in the middle of the film before the protagonists reach Rio Lobo. McNally, Frenchie and Shasta are camping out in the desert where a running joke starts concerning McNally being ""comfortable"" for women (but not romantically attractive). I love this sequence.

There are great Arizona locations (along with Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico). In the Civil War sequences they did a pretty good job of pretending it was the East. Speaking of which, I like how the movie covers a lot of ground and isn't one-dimensional in setting. Critics complain that this makes the story disjointed when it's actually a positive thing.

NEGATIVES or SUPPOSED NEGATIVES:

The second half's plot concerning the political corruption in Rio Lobo is convoluted and my mind tends to wander at various points. So the story is compelling in the first half, but not so much in the second. Thankfully, the quality characters and the setting keep me watching.

Some have complained about the acting, particularly O'Neill, Rivero and Mitchum, but is this their fault or the writer's? I just chalk it up to the distinctiveness of the actors. I've met numerous unique people in life who act peculiarly, but it's really just their special individuality or style. Gary Cooper & John Wayne are good examples. I think that's the case here more than anything.

A couple scenes are unconvincing. For instance, when Frenchie suddenly darts into a house where Lansing's character is dressing, which is their first meeting; the ensuing conversation just doesn't smack of reality. I suppose the filmmakers were shooting for something romantically amusing, but it seems patched in from another movie. Another example is the episode where the protagonists raid the ranch house at night: People are lurking just around the corner and they aren't able to hear the nearby ruckus? Why sure!

The opening score is only heard a few more times, briefly, but not with guitars like the opening. This composition is too great to be heard in such a limited capacity. Why not at least utilize it for the ending?

""Rio Lobo"" has slight similarities to Hawks & Wayne's ""Rio Bravo"" (1959) and ""El Dorado"" (1967), but ""Rio Lobo"" is far from a remake, as some suggest. It has an altogether different story.

BOTTOM LINE: Yes, the story is disjointed and there are a couple unconvincing scenes, but ""Rio Lobo"" possesses several aspects that are really good and even great, like the opening score/guitar sequence, the thrilling train robbery & Civil War parts, the likable protagonists & their camaraderie, the beautiful women and great locations.

The film runs 114 minutes.

GRADE: B- (a weak 4/5 Stars or strong 3/5 Stars)",1293753600,,5363,5.113142857142857
368177,2,630179849X,"""Rio Lobo"" (1970) is the last and least of the John Wayne/ Howard Hawks collaborations that began with ""Red River"" (1948) and included ""Rio Bravo"" (1959) and ""El Dorado"" (1967).

There are three problems with ""Rio Lobo"" - the script is poor, the supporting cast is not up to the task, and the Duke himself appears bloated, unsteady on his feet, and disinterested.

John Wayne was still a bankable box office draw at the time, having appeared in such western hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""The Searchers"" (1956), ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), ""The Alamo"" (1960), ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962), and ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965),and he finally earned an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969).
Wayne was recovering from lung surgery to remove cancer, yet appeared in 2 films in 1969 and 2 in 1970, including one that he produced (""Chisum""). He shows more than a little wear as a result.

But there isn't any excuse for the rest of the cast, who perform poorly. Wayne normally surrounded himself with a small group of players on whom he could rely. Apart from Hank Worden (he played ol' Mose in ""The Searchers"") who has a very minor part, the rest of the cast are not part of that group, and it shows.

This was Jennifer O'Neill's third film and it shows. It was also Chris Mitchum's third film and it's also painfully obvious. Wayne's co-star is relatively unknown Jorge Rosas who was primarily active in the Mexican and European markets. This was his third English speaking film. Even the venerable Jack Elam seems to be off kilter. Elam (1918-2003) was a staple in western films, usually appearing as a villain. He made substantial contributions to films such as ""Vera Cruz"" (1954), ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957), and ""Once Upon a Time in the  West"" (1968). I remember him best as Alamosa Bill from ""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" (1973).

BTW - former Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing has a small part as a friend of Mitchum. This was her second and final film appearance.

With a poor script, inexperienced actors, and a clearly wounded Wayne, there wasn't much hope for this film and it shows. For Howard Hawks (1896-1977), a great director, this would be his final film. Hawks was nominated 3 times for a DGA award for ""Red River"" (1948), ""The Big Sky"" (1952) and ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). He was Oscar nominated for ""Sergeant York"" (1941).

The film is not without some positive scenes. The train robbery, for example, is a real gem and the location photography is good. William Clothier (1903-96), the cinematographer,  was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Cheyene Autumn"" and ""The Alamo"") and worked with John Wayne on more than 20 films, including ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""The Sea Chase"" (1955), ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962).

But anyone interested in seeing a good John Wayne film should avoid it, and the great skills of Howard Hawks are not on display in this one. Their previous 3 films together are much better, and ""Red River"" is one of the best westerns of all time.",1293235200,5,3087,4.742537313432836
368178,2,630179849X,"I bow to no one in my ardor as a John Wayne fan -- but I think Rio Lobo was phoned in.  There are holes in the plot big enough to drive an aircraft carrier through; parts of the film drag on -- it should've been cut by at least 15 minutes; whoever played the bad guy sheriff was badly miscast.  If Hawks was going to do a remake of previous John Wayne films, he could've done it a lot better.
The young actors were interesting; I found myself wondering whatever had happened to Jorge Rivero (in the James Caan/Ricky Nelson role as ""Frenchy""); he was good-looking enough and athletic enough to hold the viewer's interest when he was on-screen.  I read that he was an earlier matinee idol in Spanish-language films.  Too bad for English-speaking viewers that he couldn't have appeared in more English-language films.

368200,5,630179849X,"A pretty good Waynestern from 1970.  While Wayne was ill during the filming of this movie, he hides it pretty well.  His Col. Cord McNally is the hero of the movie, but not its romantic lead.  The running joke is his being ""comfortable"" for the women in the movie.  The romantic lead goes to Jorge Rivero as Capt. Pierre Cordona (Wayne calls him Frenchy).  Jennifer O'Neill is the female lead and is OK, but delivers her lines a bit awkwardly.  For my money Susana Dosamentes as Maria Carmen and Sherry Lansing (yes, the later head of 20th Century Fox) as Amelita are more convincing.  Be that as it may, it is a good story and a very enjoyable film.

The story opens with Wayne and his Union troops waiting for a gold shipment.  However, some Confederate Raiders know about the shipment and have a rather elaborate scheme to steal to gold as they have in previous shipments.  Wayne pursues the Raiders, is captured and gets to know Cordona and Tuscadora Phillips (Christopher Mitchum).  Wayne finds a way to turn the tables and after the war is over he meets up with Cordona and Tuscadora again to find out who the traitor was that tipped them off about the gold shipments.  They give him what they know and Wayne helps them with some resources to get home.

Later, Cordona and McNally meet with Shasta Delany (O'Neill) when she involves them in a shootout as she is trying to escape from some obviously crooked lawmen.  It turns out that she is from the border town where Tuscador lives and it is being run by a very bad man named Ketcham (Victor French).  McNally, Cordona, and Shasta head to Rio Lobo to help their Tuscadora.  Along the way they also meet Tuscadora's father (played wonderfully by Jack Elam) and a great confrontation is set up that takes the rest of the film.  Quite a good Western, I think (my son calls them Waynesterns).

Watch for the Wanted poster for Hondo Lane when the action turns around the Sheriff's Office.

368202,4,630179849X,"The first part of this western is relatively unique; the second part is commonplace in John Wayne movies. The latter contains such themes as shootouts between posses of good and bad guys, a trade of kidnapped men (the bad guys' boss for Frenchie), and heavy drinking. In fact, McNally (Wayne) has this comment about a drink: ""Boy, this stuff ain't for the young!""

The train robbery is creatively portrayed. A group of Confederate guerillas, evidently tipped off about a transport of gold, tap-in into a telegraph wire, and thereby correctly infer which train is going to carry the gold. Then they set up a trap: They grease a section of railway so that the targeted train will stall for lack of traction. Once this happens, they come out of hiding and ambush the train. They throw a bag of bees into a train compartment in order to put the men inside out of action and to force them to jump out of the train. Finally, they detach the gold-bearing wagon from the rest of the train, and steer it to a prearranged place where it can be ground to a halt and stripped of its gold-bearing chest.

Those who feel that westerns ignore women or always place them in passive roles will like this film. There are two women who are good with guns, and who put them to use when the men won't do their jobs to secure justice for them. One of the men gives a form of respect to one of these women: ""She's got legs and she can shoot!""",1187049600,11,1419,4.391634980988593

Rio Lobo is one of my favorite westerns of his.  The great thing about his movies is that I can watch them with my 2 grandsons and do not have to worry about them seeing something inappropriate for their young age unlike movies made today.  We recently purchased a LCD HDTV so we can enjoy them like they were shown in theaters which makes them even more enjoyable to watch.",1178928000,5,538,4.2772277227722775

The dialogues are incisive and snappy, John Wayne is an old wolf who will put order in a town submitted by an abominable gang with the consent of a corrupt sheriff.

368228,3,630179849X,"As many other reviewers have noted, Rio Lobo is not one of John Wayne's better western tales. Overall, it is pretty entertaining, but there is not much new to offer. In fact, the Duke kind of seems over the hill in this one.

The plot is pretty simple to follow, and there are some pretty good gun fights. But, the acting is pretty lacking. Therefore, I do not recommend watching this movie, unless you are a pretty big John Wayne fan. If not, check out some of his earlier Westerns.",1162080000,3,483,4.366666666666666

368230,4,630179849X,"Not that it's bad, of course.  Fans of the Duke will want to add ""Rio Lobo"" to their collection because it's classic John Wayne stuff.  This time, the Duke is a Yankee Colonel who attempts to track down a pair of Union traitors responsible for the theft of Union gold shipments during the Civil Was and ultimately, the death of a Yankee Lieutenant who was like a son to Wayne's character in the movie.  Along the way, he is aided by a pair of Rebs (Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum) and beautiful Jennifer O'Neill.  The quartet find themselves facing overwhelming odds (don't they always?) as they attempt to get the bad guy, while at the same time helping the oppressed citizens of Rio Lobo.

Director Howard Hawks sticks to his tried-and-true (and successful) formula and puts together a fast-moving, action-filled film.  OK, so the acting (especially poor Jennifer O'Neill) is stilted, but viewers of this film didn't go to it (or get the DVD) because they were looking for Oscar calibre' performances.

It's pure Duke with copious amounts of gunfire, self-depreciating humor and great Western scenery.  The film score ranks with some of the best work done by Jerry Goldsmith.  Hawks uses his patented clipped dialogue to keep the plot moving.  The supporting cast, including Victor French, Mike Henry, David Huddleston and Western veterans Jim Davis and Jack Elam, are great components to the film.

If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned Duke classics, then you'll enjoy ""Rio Lobo""",1135987200,12,1486,4.927710843373494
368231,4,630179849X,"This is the third remake of essentially the same story by director Hawks and star Wayne. The first two, Rio Bravo and El Dorado are superior with castmates like Dean Martin, Angie Dickenson, and Robert Mitchum though this affable outing is pleasant enough with suppport from the great Jack Elam and the gorgeous Jennifer O'Neal. Wayne, in the sunset of his career, turns in a workmanlike performance with deprecating humor. It's good fun and pleasant to spend time with. No Oscar asperations here.",1135468800,7,497,5.0

368233,3,630179849X,"Confederate soldiers are helping to fund their losing cause at the end of the Civil War by stealing gold shipments from the railroad. Colonel McNally (John Wayne) is assigned to stop them. An ingenius robbery plot is executed by the French/Mexican confederate Captain, Jorge Rivera but is foiled at the last minute. And somewhere in the Union army two traitors remain at large...

Years later, the circle is reformed when a helpless maiden, Shasta, (Jennifer O'Neill) rides into town at the same time as retired Colonel McNally. She is looking to bring to justice  the very cads that McNally is still searching for. Add the rebel Captain and seargent and the team is nearly complete as justice swings out to seek its final judgement on the villains.

Who swaggers more convincingly or rides taller in the saddle than John Wayne? From beginning to end, the viewer is compelled to smile at the bravado, warmth, and fun of the film.

Made 35 years ago, this is without doubt, the corniest of the John Wayne westerns. The Duke and Jack Elam turn in the best performances of the bunch. John Wayne is ""comfortable"" in every respect!",1114819200,7,1126,4.788659793814433
368234,3,630179849X,"By 1970, John Wayne had his Oscar in his pocket and Rio Lobo on some inspection looks like just a lot of good, clean fun he and the cast decided to have, with no particular regard for making cinematic history. The plot rambles and has some implausabilities-like why does the Duke, who plays a Yankee, go home to Blackthorne, Texas? And Jorge Rivero as a Confederate officer takes some getting used to. Same thing, different reason, with Jennifer O'Neill. She seems too contemporary for a historic setting and her acting is questionable. However, by dogies, she is just so beautiful (and one of the hottest actresses in demand in the early 70's) that she can be forgiven for any dramatic failings.

One of the strengths of the film is the Duke's self-deprecating humor is in fine display, and so is John Wayne himself. Chisum, which was made about this time, is a better film in my estimation, but Mr. Wayne is practically relegated to a supporting player in it. In Rio Lobo he is in almost every scene and that alone makes it a pleasure to watch. Jack Elam hams it up and David Huddleston adds a nice touch of comedy. Trivia buffs will enjoy Sherri Lansing (future studio head) in the near buff and George Plimpton, fresh off his Paper Tiger days, getting a bit role as a short-lived bad guy.

As for improving the movie, it suffers because the death of the lieutenant, which is the main motivating force for Wayne's character to go after the bad guys, is little seen by the audience. We need to connect with this guy so we feel strongly that justice must be done. This character should have been played by a well-known actor in a cameo role. An obvious choice would have been Patrick Wayne. Then the audience would know the character even though their presence onscreen is brief and make a stronger emotional connection with them. Another thing is the sheriff of Rio Lobo is supposed to be a really mean hombre, but we don't have enough scenes with him to establish this. At the very least, a scene should be added where he brutally questions the Sherri Lansing character and scars her. It wouldn't have to be graphic-just enough to once again emotionally connect with the audience.

Mr. Wayne's DVDs are not getting the attention that his fans deserve! George Plimpton had a television special on making Rio Lobo-this should be an extra included. And, my gosh, The Alamo had 500,000 feet of film shot-some by John Ford. What do we get in bonus material? ZIP! NADA! JACKSQUAT! C'mon Hollywood, this is THE most important film actor of the 20th Century! Get off yer duffs and find this stuff. This is HISTORY!",1097798400,68,2609,4.630669546436285
