8306411,5,B001GP5TKO,"It's stupid fun.  The workouts are sufficient, I suppose, but the DVD works because the actors keep things light and lively.  If you are a top-tier athlete, there is nothing in here that will challenge you.  But then, if you are a top-tier athlete, you probably aren't searching for B-actors promoting a now defunct reality sports show to give you fitness advice, now are you?

There are three main workouts, each that last about 20 minutes.  Like basically all workouts, if you push yourself, it works.  If you don't push yourself, it doesn't work.  But, as I say, that can be said for just about all workouts.  There are also shorter, specialized programs for different target areas.

I would recommend this for anyone who wants a decent introductory or maybe even intermediate workout program, especially if they are looking to keep the mood of their workout light.  There are plenty of laughs in here, e.g. Titan (Mike O'Hearn) constantly referring to himself in the third person, and Crush (Gina Carano) constantly mocking the fitness instructors with innuendo and jokes . . .  Take it for what it is.",1418774400,5,1106,4.829787234042553

8306414,5,B001GP5TKO,"This item was received in plenty of time and was in excellent/new condition as it was advertised.  It's a great workout video, by the way.",1246665600,4,138,4.52
8306415,5,B001GP5TKO,"I had never heard of this workout before so I was skeptical but thought I'd give it a try.
I love that you can customize the workout. You can do all 3 if you like...switch them up in any order or you can do just one or two.
It also has bonus challenge workouts I haven't tried yet but I am anxious to.
Working out with the gladiators makes you feel like you can kick some butt...at the same time they make it fun and make you feel like you fit right in with them.
The cardio workout is probably best for beginners and the 2nd workout incoorperates weights with cardio...more advanced...I'm sore today but it felt great!
I would highly recommend this as a fun, challenging exercise dvd
5 stars!",1231891200,7,693,4.297709923664122
