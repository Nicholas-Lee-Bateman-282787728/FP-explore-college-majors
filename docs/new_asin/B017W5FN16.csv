8740864,5,B017W5FN16,My boys (5 & 7) love this series.  We started watching it on prime so much that we got them the DVDs for their birthday.  They love to watch them and I love that they are learning something.,1526947200,,190,3.973684210526316
8740865,5,B017W5FN16,"We love Cat in the Hat! Its silly enough to keep my toddler entertained while learning at the same time. I like getting the series instead of the random episode DVDs, you get a lot more for your money. I would definitely buy this again. We have all 4 of the sets from volume 1. Kids learn about how plants and flowers grow, the colors of the rainbow, microorganisms, etc without getting too in depth (or boring). If you like the DVDs check out the Cat in the Hat learning library series of books too. Episodes in this set include:
Trick or Treat
King Cecil the Seahorse
Stripy Safari
Wool
A Sweet Deal
King of Swing
Amazing Eyes
Water Walkers
Super Cleaner Uppers
