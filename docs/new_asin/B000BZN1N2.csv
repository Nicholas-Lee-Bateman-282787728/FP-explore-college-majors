8094921,3,B000BZN1N2,"Typical for the late lamented Something Weird releases through Image, there's something very amusing (Hip Hot and 21) paired with something lousy and boring (Hot Thrills and Warm Chills) based on some vague resemblance in plot or a shared actor.  In this case, the tie revolves around an ostensible heist plot.  But if you're expecting the likes of Grand Slam, Topkapi, or even Ocean's Eleven, forget it - the actual heists barely get off the ground, aren't actually shown (only referred to in the voiceover), or play such a minimal part in the proceedings as to be almost nonexistent.

What are you watching this for?  Well, as any Something Weird junkie knows, there's only two reasons to watch these - the unintentional comedy and weirdness of the proceedings (generally based on their homespun naievete and/or inability to accomplish what they set out to do) and the sex.  The latter film (Hot Thrills) focuses on the latter, and boy is it boring!  We're not exactly talking The Image or an Emanuelle film here, folks - there comes a point when the laughter stops and the fast forward button gets utilized.

But the former is thankfully more in line with the former virtue of SWV films, and all the better for it.  Some ridiculous drag queen of a woman sits around her dumpy hotel room in an absurd nightie, dancing to goofy 60's music and drinking.  She invites some other trailer park pals over (doubtless on their day off from the strip club), they all get drunk and talk about their men's inadequacies, and formulate a vaguely noted scheme to rob a bank.  Then we get a very long sequence showing a Mardi Gras procession, with the girls wandering through it - there's a brief gunfight, and it's all over.  The entire heist never happens onscreen, and there isn't exactly a chase scene at the end...it's a lot of talk in voiceover and very little action.

Thankfully, the overblown Southern accents on display, the banality and absurdity of the conversations and proceedings, and the sheer ineptitude of the filmmakers and actors involved make this a true comic gem - we laughed and heckled the whole way through.  And that's what we looked to these SWV releases for in the first place, wasn't it?",1254096000,11,2204,4.753280839895013
8094922,5,B000BZN1N2,"Absolutely the most beautiful girls in ANY Something Weird Video I own. And that's saying something believe me...I currently own almost 40 Something Weird DVD's and counting, but this one(both movies in the set) have the best dancing and the most beautiful late 60's women I have seen thus far. Just awe inspiring. I don't even know what the films were about after the first viewing. I was mesmorized by the women too much I guess. I do however remember a really funny and fowlmouthed cussing old man in the first film that made me laugh after he sold off his lovely step daughter to some creep for $50 cash. haha! What a deal. Anyway, I highly recommend that if you like Something Weird Videos late 60's sexploitation genre that you buy this DVD as quick as you can. You will not regret it! Enjoy! -Chris, Florida",1222300800,26,814,4.54421768707483
