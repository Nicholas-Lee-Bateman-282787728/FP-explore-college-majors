8574656,5,B00BW7OX8U,"Dr. No. From Russia With Love. Goldfinger. Is there really another actor capable of portraying James Bond other than Sean Connery? I grant you Daniel Craig is doing an admirable job in his three 007 films, especially Casino Royale, in which Craig may have surpassed Connery for rugged panache. (Connery never seemed to have a a hair out of place, or a wrinkle in his Savoy Row suits despite wrestling bad guys like Robert Shaw). But the three first 007 films are in a class by themselves. Vintage stuff. What a hoot when Gert Frob, (Goldfinger), replies to Connery's question, ""Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger? (while strapped down on a metal table about to be lasered up the groin), ""No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die."" Great fun showing such scenes as that one to my kids, who never knew the delights and perils of Mr. 007. Beats out Bruce Willis and those schmoes any day. Super in Blue Ray. Amazon has done it's usual excellent job as the seller.",1382227200,,954,4.520231213872832
8574657,5,B00BW7OX8U,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.
These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.
Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.
Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.
DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.
But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is exceptional filmmaking. When compared to other films in the series it stands alone bringing in very few, if any, elements of the fantastic allowing Bond to rely on his own wit and skill for survival to overcome the opposition.
Over the years FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE seems to have been forgotten and gotten lost from the cinema conscious minds of the movie going public and even some Bond fans. I think with the advent 2006's CASINO ROYALE there has be a resurgence to look back at the style of filmmaking found in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. James Bond is that dedicated civil servant who can handle himself in any situation. From a realistic standpoint, I think we can find that in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and in some ways Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is the definitive performance of the entire series.
GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.
The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.
Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.
Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.
Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well-honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.
Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character.",1381622400,3,5579,5.019417475728155
