5077687,5,B007CNCT0W,my 10 month old boy just loves these trucks & screams & jumps for joy!  I like the biblical life lessons emphasized in the end of each segment also.,1438905600,,148,4.103448275862069
5077688,5,B007CNCT0W,"Great video - especially for boys who love trucks.  Teaches about kindness, sharing, etc - things that you are teaching your child anyway but it is great when it is put on video and consequences can be demonstrated.  Video is good quality and trucks are very life-like and easily capture the attention of preschoolers!  This is one video you won't mind your little one watching over and over.",1425772800,,392,4.735294117647059
5077689,3,B007CNCT0W,"Fairly good on a technical level, for a very young audience, with vehicles that my 2-year-old likes watching. The simple messages of the episodes are good. On the down side, there is only one female character and she's--you guessed it--*pink* (Meteor's mom is also pink, apparently the way to tell a vehicle is female is the fact that they're different shades of a single color despite the array of colors on the males). Some of the names are painfully cheesy, like the fire truck being named Jose because he has a water-spraying hose (yeah, ouch), and the one female is named Ponytail because...she has a ponytail. And makes occasional vaguely cowgirlish references to horsepower. Yep. I personally prefer the greater subtlety, humor, and music of VeggieTales, but while my son also likes that, he does so love ""CARS!"" and it really was cool to find something for that taste that actually has Christian values/messages to it.",1421971200,,926,4.9423076923076925

5077691,5,B007CNCT0W,"I am very picky when it comes to what my kids watch.  I have certain criteria that must be met, and ""Monster Truck Adventures: Meteor and Friends"" meets that criteria.  I found nothing to be questionable or frightening in the video.  The characters are generally kind to one another.  Yet, they are realistically flawed.  This video is not one of those kids' videos which contain characters behaving in ways that I do not want my children copying.  My favorite thing is that each episode does a fantastic job of highlighting a Bible verse.

There's nothing I dislike about this video.  And my 5 year old & 3 year old sons LOVE watching this (they even take it with to Grandma's).  I would estimate that boys up to age 8 would enjoy watching this.

At home, I allow this as an alternative to the Auto-Be-Good videos, which I don't allow.  Dare I say, I even prefer this over the Veggie Tales videos, too.  I plan to purchase more ""Monster Truck Adventures"" for my sons.

""Monster Truck Adventures"" is perfect for Christian parents who are looking for quality entertainment that encourages character-growth in their young sons.",1368403200,,1125,4.737113402061856

8514635,5,B007CNCT0W,"All my boys (2, 5, 9) love this show. It does clearly state Bible verses and is very entertaining to watch. The monster trucks talk and have childlike voices and they make mistakes like kids do and then learn from their mistakes.",1486512000,,229,4.476190476190476

8514638,1,B007CNCT0W,"Incomplete!  This is supposed to be identical to the DVD, which includes six episodes back to back and runs roughly an hour and 15 minutes.  The Amazon video version is only 40 minutes long. If you buy this digital version, you will only get the first three episodes and about a minute of the fourth one. It will then abruptly cut off. So, you're not getting all that you pay for.  Amazon has apparently made an error when uploading this file for streaming.",1458345600,,457,4.481927710843373
