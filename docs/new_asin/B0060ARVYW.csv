8490320,4,B0060ARVYW,"As regular release collections of some of the best bits of the UK TV show Top Gear these DVDs are pretty good to pick up for the casual fan that won't be buying all the series in their entirety. Just be careful your able to play Region 2 encoded DVDs. This release is the usual menagerie of weird and stupid vehicular shenanigans, road tests and automotive challenges and the highlights are;

Motorhomes:- Quite a funny segment where the chaps head to Cornwall in their self designed motorhomes.

The making of the Car Advert:- A less stellar segment where deliberate stupidity is overused for comedic effect.

British Sports Cars:- Quite a fun chapter this as the lads take three examples of British sports car on a tour to the factories that built them, factories now deadly silent.

Cheap Saloon Cars in Germany:- A familiar theme this one, the guys go and buy a second hand car and drive about seeing what sort of a deal they got.

The Dakar Car versus the Snowmobiles:- Harmless fun here as Hammond races down ski runs and across a frozen lake against some lads on snowmobiles.

Topsy Turvy Reliant Robins:- An excuse for Jeremy to blather on about the Reliant Robin and for endless jokes about their penchant for rolling over.

The Veyron in Hyperdrive: James May blasts to insane speeds in a tricked out Veyron.

Airport Vehicles Race:- A bunch of airport vehicles crash and bash into each other. Which is a little more fun than it sounds.

The Caravan Airship:- Up there with bad ideas of our time, this segment feature an airship with a caravan attached as a way of avoiding having to take a caravan. Problem is of course you are carless once you get to your destination. Luckily a second person driving a Lamborghini can alleviate this issue.

The Twingo in Belfast:- Another of Jeremy Clarksons over the top product tests.

Mays Volcanic Adventure:- Harking back to their Polar adventure James May travels to Iceland to pick up one of the vehicles used in that adventure and tries to see how close he can get to a volcano. Stupid, but fun.

Gravity Drop Race:- Yep, you drive a Porsche really fast and see if it gets to the finish line faster than a VW Beetle dropped for a certain distance in the sky. Simple as.

There are some other bonus features on this two disc set but the above are the star attractions.",1400889600,,2322,4.593220338983051
