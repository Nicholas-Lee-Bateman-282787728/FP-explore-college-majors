Great brilliant movie . Some of the movies from just a few years back are so much better than what's coming out now .
I wish every teenager and young adult had to sit down and watch this movie with their parents . Maybe it's just me but I feel the dignity and respect slipping away and I'm only 42 years old with a 22 year old son .
This movie was just incredible in teaching values and great acting and storyline.

Special thank you to my seller for getting this to me quickly and well packaged. I appreciate each disc you send to me and your excellent customer service
Blessings and Peace and many thanks

This is one of my favourite movies and even though a father and son have conflicts and go through the test of time, they still love each other dearly.

A spoilt son and a father who gives him the world but later on, takes away the son's privileges to teach him the value of money.

The son gets upset and ends up working to provide for himself and his now pregnant wife.

It is a sweet family story. I love their helper and his fifty annoying questions *haha*",1473292800,,489,4.170212765957447

8147984,1,B000IZJRWE,"I have never left a negative review until now.  As  fan of Bollywood movies, I was excited to finally own this video...I guess it was never meant to be.  The first attempt at owning this film was a disappointment because I was sent the wrong movie.  Yes, the title was the same but the movie was not only a different VERSION, the cover, the cast and the film release date were no where CLOSE to what the storefront advertised.  The SECOND attempt had me waiting several weeks for a fulfillment of my order even though this totally separate storefront says that there is ONLY ONE LEFT.  I am confused...",1392940800,,602,4.477064220183486
8147985,3,B000IZJRWE,"This movie is about a father who is a now-wealthy self-made man (Amitabh Bachchan) with only one child (Akshay Kumar)- a son whose every whim he has indulged. Son marries on the sly to daughter (Priyanka Chopra) of one of Dad's friends who Dad has a comic relationship with of constant one-upmanship. There is also a loyal servant who is so simple minded that its hard to see how he manages to do all the household tasks as he apparently does.
The new wife gets pregnant early and son is showing no sign of growing up (wanting to keep spending his fathers money on fun, and having dreams of being a celebrity rather than going into Dad's business). Son doesn't know father is dying and mother finally persuades father to stop the money flow so son can grow up and be ready for fatherhood. Son is cast out of the house and is angry (not knowing that dad is dying). The race is for the son to make some money but more than this: a race in what remains of Dads time alive.
This movie looks good and has some major actors but I didn't connect with it. Akshay's character was almost too superficial and princely and one asks whether just being given things spoils someone. If he has 2 parents of good character why didn't he collect some of their attitudes. Of course Dad overreacts in the end as well as not giving son the full story, and the son digs in stubbornly (to the father they had him adoring right up to this point). This undermined the drama for me.
In addition to this they kept putting comic bits in and were playing it as a comedy earlier then we have the dying stuff come in and it didn't read as melodrama with the lighter bits through it.
Priyanka wasn't really used much and has a lot more to her than seen here. Akshay also has more depth and perhaps that's why I found it hard to accept him in this role. Amitabh was playing fun-loving genial father as required for the part and was fine enough. The father-son relationship was also played warmly by both Amitabh and Akshay. Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav play for comedy.
They put effort into the musical numbers but they didn't remain with me (and I suspect the dance steps were a bit limited by Amitabh's dancing range.)
Now while my reaction was a bit lukewarm to this, elsewhere on the Net it tends to average a bit above average (e.g. 7 out of 10). However people seem to polarise as well: quite a few loving it with full marks and others hating it and giving it very low figures.",1243900800,5,2450,4.351528384279476
