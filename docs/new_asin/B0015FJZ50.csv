8258294,5,B0015FJZ50,"I'm a 2nd grade teacher, but I especially bought this of DVDs for my 4 year old granddaughter, who is bilingual.  Her native language is Swedish, and she is learning English.  The goal was to improve her English Language skills and increase her vocabulary.  I also sent along some of the Scholastic paperback books that go with the videos.  I used some of the DVD's in my classroom first as a reading practice, since you can choose the option to show the ""subtitles"" at the bottom of the screen.  They were nicely paced for beginning readers, with the text shown at the bottom of the page, and highlighted when the narrator reads each word. Plus each DVD has about 6 stories/books on it, and it's easy to find the companion paperbacks at a bookstore, or scholastic.com.  Or Amazon, or even a used bookstore, since many of the stories have been popular children's books for quite some time.  It's a good literacy tool.",1235088000,8,917,4.6234567901234565
