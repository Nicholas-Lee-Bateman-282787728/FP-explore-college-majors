2672535,5,B000JJ5GE2,"I purchased this DVD at the Monterey Bay Aquarium after seeing their jellyfish exhibits and can tell you the dvd
on a large screen TV looks better than the real exhibit at the aquarium. Simply awesome.  Beautiful photography and great music.

I soon purchased four more of these DVDs as gifts and in the ultimate act of lunancy seriously considered trading up my 42-inch plasma for a 50-inch one to better see JUST this DVD.  My friends whom I have given a copy of the DVD love it also, although I must admit seeing it on the 25-inch regular TV of one of these friends doesn't really do the jellyfish justice.

I work from home and keep this DVD going a good part of the day - from time to time I take a few minutes to stare at the screen and take in the music -- pure therapy.

I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.",1193529600,30,821,4.237179487179487
2672536,5,B000JJ5GE2,"Beautiful images that never fail to stun. I throw it on whenever I have company over on my 50"" plasma. People love it! Pour some wine, set out some cheese, we're good for the night.

The DVD loops repeatedly, so I never have to check on it. The HD images really show off the quality of my television. Just like it says on the cover, ""Turns my television into living artwork.""

Just gave out a bunch for Christmas presents. All my friends are stoked.",1167177600,6,449,4.333333333333333

2672548,5,B000JJ5GE2,This video is a work of art for persons who enjoy viewing Jellies.  It would be of little interest for anyone wanting high speed action.,1397433600,5,136,4.44
2672549,3,B000JJ5GE2,This is a beautiful video but very repetitive and pricey.  The price would have been worth it if the same jellyfish did not monopolize the screen.  I bought this to share with my grandsons but they quickly lost interest.  I use it mostly as a screen scene.,1385683200,,256,4.404255319148936

2672551,5,B000JJ5GE2,The images of jellyfish are beautiful and the fact they also come with some color effects & 3 choices of music plus an extra clip of a school of fish is a real bonus. It's the next best thing to having an aquarium of your own without the expense and hassle! Shipping was also on time.,1366675200,5,284,4.089285714285714

I found it mesmerizing and felt I had to get it.  I finally got my copy and have to say that it adds to the ambiance of any space and not only serves as a stunning background, but also as a source of escapism and retreat.  I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates the beauty of nature and the benefits of 'getting lost,' even for just a moment.",1210204800,22,788,7.1875

2672555,5,B000JJ5GE2,"This video is out of this world.  If you're looking for a jellyfish video for your TV, this is it, look no further. I was so pleasantly surprised, it's much better than I expected.  The jellyfish are shot with a black background and they appear several at a time like they are coming out of nowhere.  It's actual swimming, very slow and appealing.  They also have extra views on the DVD that have red or blue lighting effects that are truly mesmerizing.  I rarely review anything, but this thing blew me away.",1199404800,9,509,4.489130434782608

8150883,5,B000JJ5GE2,This jellyfish dvd is marvelously filmed and looks amazing in HD Blu-ray.  There are 3 music choices.  There are many various colored jellyfish scenes that you can pick from or just allow the disc to play out in the order it is presented.  So relaxing.  The water is crystal clear with no distracting lights or reflections.  Looks exactly as if you are viewing a tank.  The filming on this disc is much better than the Ambient Collection version that I also bought.  This is the one to get!,1402531200,4,490,4.5
