3628772,5,B001HBQJZG,"I buy a lot of ambient DVDs for background noise and the like. I just don't like it quite when I am doing quiet things like studying or reading. This I bought because it looked interesting, and it's great. I can see its utility for holloween and parties but to tell the truth, I leave it on for background. Its way cool on the easy graphics and the sound track is well moderated and pretty cool, it does not over power or shock you and provides a smooth but cool background. I am a writer as a hobby and this is a great track to put on the tv while I chill, write, or study. Love it. Decided to leave a review while looking to see if there were any more.",1274572800,8,654,4.0

8308499,5,B001HBQJZG,"For simple atmospheric background visuals to any hauntingly good party, put this on, with sound on or not.  I prefer it on, but it depends on whether you want to converse much or just be loud and crazy!  Each scene is crisp and clear, well done for a basic DVD, and, of course, you can set your player to Repeat for a seamless display.  It might be rather difficult to find, so to each their own regarding what one thinks is a fair price.  Whether for a party or just relaxing with some melancholic Goth music or dark Ambient soundscapes, this disc is a perfect companion.",1511308800,,572,4.367924528301887
8308500,1,B001HBQJZG,1 star is being generous. It's very amateurish & oh so boring. Interestingly the scenes get more boring as it goes on rather than getting better. Since almost nothing moves in each segment & a segment lasts for many minutes it may end up harming the pixels in the t.v..What a waste of money this purchase is.,1484611200,,308,4.421052631578948

8308502,5,B001HBQJZG,"I love this ambient DVD, perfect for the halloween season!  It sets up the atmosphere of Halloween very well without being scary, silly or repellent.  The sounds of wind, storms, crows, organ music, etc. along with the fog/vapor are subtle and enjoyable. The five mostly static scenes are  1) jack-o'lantern (two scenes of lighted carved pumpkins on a bale of hay), 2) haunted mantlepiece (with ticking and chiming mantel clock), 3) graveyard (tombstone with thunderstorm sounds), 4) witches brew (boiling cauldron with vapor), and 5) dungeon (basement type scene with large skull on red velvet tablecloth with vapor.)",1444089600,8,618,5.285714285714286
8308503,5,B001HBQJZG,"This is exactly what I wanted. I throw a Halloween party every year, and this will be the perfect backdrop for the living room. I did a test run after it arrived and it's perfect. The house will be fully decorated for Halloween, and this little extra touch is what I've been looking for. Thank you!",1439424000,,298,4.339285714285714
8308504,4,B001HBQJZG,"This DVD has 5 different scenes that you can play or pick just one scene and play.  The scenes include- spooky jack o lanterns, dungeon, witches brew, scary fireplace, and graveyard.  Each scene has spooky music as well.  The DVD automatically plays from the beginning when it gets to the end.  Overall it is a decent mood setter for the price especially if played on a big HD TV with a nice speaker system.",1377648000,4,407,4.45945945945946
8308505,1,B001HBQJZG,"This DVD is terrible. It has a few very boring scenes and as if that wasn't enough, several of the scenes are just the same scene with the furniture and props changed around. Very dissapointing purchase. Amazon should consider removing it from its offerings.",1354233600,4,258,4.886363636363637
8308506,5,B001HBQJZG,"If you like Halloween or Gothic ambience, this dvd is fantastic. It has several different scenes, including a cornfield with jack-o-lanterns, a spooky fireplace scene, and two other eerie vignettes. I'm a Halloween fanatic, and some days have this dvd playing on my TV all day. It's that beautiful. Highly recommended dvd, and a super seller.",1299801600,4,342,5.125
8308507,5,B001HBQJZG,"I ordered this DVD for a Halloween party and it helped set the atmosphere. It's essentially background - pictures and sound effects or music.
I had the volume down most of the time and had the video playing.  Now I've put it away until next Halloween; it should come in handy for
our Halloween party for some years to come.",1292112000,2,323,4.383333333333334
