8175137,1,B000H2BCNK,"This is one of the most poorly produced gangster ""documentaries"" I've ever seen and many notches below the usual standard we've come to expect from the History/Discovery Channel. It isn't really a documentary at all. It's a peculiar sort of hybrid of documentary and docu-drama in which narrator Steve Schirripa, of ""Soprano's"" fame, acts out the part of a mobster host with his rehearsed wiseguy style. A simple sincere narration would have carried so much more impact and lent infinitely more credibility and realism. The footage itself is, to a very large extent, composed of still shots of actors in posed scenes. I'm guessing we're supposed to get the impression that these are candid shots of the real story as it unfolded. The whole thing reeks of third-rate exploitation with no substance and a lot of superficial, low-budget visual style. I couldn't watch it beyond the first unrelentingly bad 15 minutes. If 15 minutes isn't enough to make my review a fair one then it'll just have to do, because I'm certainly not going to watch it again and there's no appeal in moving on to disc 2. One star suggests that it's 20% as good as a 5-star movie. Not even close.",1160611200,,1169,4.763546798029557
