4118445,5,B003F674A0,"Caught a censored version on cable, so thought I would buy. I foung it to be extremely funny. Enough to make me laugh out loud and tear up from laughing. But please.... if you are easily offended or do not like a lot of foul language... stay away. For the rest of us-GREAT FUN AND LOTS OF LAUGHS.. All of my friends love it.",1332028800,,324,4.078125
4118446,5,B003F674A0,"If you haven't had the privilege (as I have) of seeing Hal perform live, this is the next best thing. The man is witty, smart, funny and a big bundle of energy. An amazing performance and just a great guy.",1307836800,,205,4.15

4118448,5,B003F674A0,"Once again, Hal Sparks proves there really isn't anything better than intelligent comedy. From the challenges of sexting to the reality of Starbucks, Hal takes the obvious truths in everyday life and makes them hysterical. If you're looking for a great laugh from a brilliant man, Charmageddon will not disappoint.",1278720000,,314,5.3
4118449,5,B003F674A0,"Hal Sparks is amazing!
His witty and snarky stand up is illuminating and hilarious.
From his take on ""made up and inappropriately used words"" to the automated phone service with every stop along the way making your sides hurt from laughter. Now don't get me wrong, Hal is more than a barrel of laughs and a pretty face. He is very savvy about politics, the world and how we chose to travel it.
He is straight edged and he takes no prisoners when he talks about things like the stench of smokers, and the folly of drinkers. The visuals his descriptions conjure will stick with you for a long time.
So if I haven't convinced you yet....go watch a couple of clips!

If you want to experience this brilliance live, or catch him at one of his many charity events check out his official site [...]
So peeps, buy Charmageddon, and Escape from Halcatraz right here, right now!
Be in the know, about the dangers of Sexting whilst driving, and hope to hear the infamous ""Nnnff!!!""",1277424000,,974,4.508474576271187
4118450,5,B003F674A0,"Fearless. If there's any word that defines Hal Sparks, it's fearless. There's no sacred cow he isn't willing to slay, and his laser focus misses nothing. From how you order on a menu to how we relate to each other, Hal cuts through all the oxymorons with a machete sharp wit refined by years of experience.

By the tender age of 17 Hal had won the Funniest Teenager in Chicago contest, and by 18 he had moved to California to pursue this as a professional career. Hal has been working at his craft ever since, and can be seen regularly headlining in many sold out comedy clubs all over the country.

""Charmageddon"" was filmed in Orange County, in front of a standing room only crowd. Hal brings his more adult oriented material to the stage, which includes such bits as ""Sexting"", ""Inbreeding Insurance"" and ""Vagina Says"". It's not for the closed minded or the faint of heart, but if you're willing to laugh (sometimes even at yourself), and if you've been waiting for a heavy metal comedian with a brain - you're ready for Charmageddon.

Also check out his debut comedy DVD ""Escape from Halcatraz"" - which you can also get from Amazon.

Check out Hal's official website to learn more, even where you can go see him perform live. Best of all you can follow him on his verified Twitter account at @HalSparks.",1275782400,7,1307,4.572649572649572
4118451,5,B003F674A0,"Just watched Charmageddon again,with the brilliant Hal Sparks,his takes on the difference between women and men,sexting and anything else of pop culture,his take on comedy is defiantlty refreshing and straight forward,treat yourlself or a friend and order the dvd promise you won't be disappointed",1275782400,3,297,5.7727272727272725
4118452,5,B003F674A0,"After catching the Charmageddon special last night on Showtime, I had to rush to my computer and pre-order the dvd. When it comes to comedy, Hal Sparks is the total package. From beginning to end his set is packed full of intelligent, hilarious, and perfectly executed comedic insight so flawless you finding yourself exclaiming ""Exactly!"" ""Yes!"" and ""That's so true!"" in between fits of uncontainable laughter. His fundamental beliefs on ""unsweetened"" tea and drink sizes are raised to new levels with his passionate delivery that will forever challenge your ability to order a medium unsweetened drink with a straight face again. And his priceless insight into the history and execution of ""sexting"" will make you sigh an enthusiastic ""Nnnff...""!

If you're looking for the perfect comedy dvd for endless repeat viewing and the enlightenment of your friends, look no further! Once Hal Sparks starts speaking his mind the only thing you'll hate about this dvd is that it ends too soon!",1275696000,,986,5.124223602484472
4118453,5,B003F674A0,"Saw Charmageddon on Showtime last night and have pre-ordered it as well.  Hal Sparks has a mind that goes in about one hundred different directions - sometimes all at once! He's smart, funny and on the ball.  In Charmageddon, he pulls no punches speaking his mind about all kinds of things from ""unsweetened tea"" to how there's very little difference between men and women to how much you need ""flow"" when you're sexting.  He's hilarious but not for the faint of heart.

I saw Hal in person last February and am waiting for him to come back around in August. Love his humor, his intelligence and his ability to just be who he is wherever he is.  Totally worth checking out - Hal's a treasure.",1275696000,,692,4.504
