7882619,3,6305052220,"Another comedy by Stephen Chow, Lawyer Lawyer is a about a famous sharp tongue lawyer and merciless trickster, Chan Mong-Gut (Chen Mengji), who frequently spends his time fooling around with his student, Ah Foon (Eric Kot). One day, however, Mong-Gut and Ah Foon fell out with each other and Ah Foon went off to Hong Kong to seek his fortune. Unfortunately, he ends up getting framed for murder and it is now up to Chan Mong Gut, and his wife (Karen Mok), to defend Ah Foon, in a British court in Hong Kong.

Lawyer Lawyer is both comical, entertaining and interesting, especially when we see how Chan Mong-Gut, who is so used to the Chinese Yamen (court) has to get use to the British Court. There are many funny moments in the show, and check out how Chan Mong-Gut eventually outwits the villains in the movie!

The plot is pretty much standard, but there're some rather funny twists. Look out for that fumbling guy who never gets anything right! Overall, it is a fairly entertaining show to watch over the weekend or with friends!",1106611200,2,1033,4.608695652173913
