7413211,5,B014I67SGU,"I love a really great movie that sneaks up on you.  There have been a few over the years that may not have been on the list of must see movies that I have stumbled across and have been quite surprised at how good they are.  I love martial art films and this one delivers.  Jackie Chan is an incredible artist and always delivers on his films,  I love that he had Adrian Brody as the villain and John Cusack as the heroic roman leader.  Both actors over the years have not been credited for their great performances.  This is no exception .  I am excited I came across this movie.  Watch it ...it may surprise you.",1526169600,,613,4.17948717948718

7413213,4,B014I67SGU,"A very low flying four stars here for what is a somewhat frustrating movie that is looks beautiful and has an international cast with fairly good effects.

In short one of the first hurdles the viewer has to leap is the basic premise of John Cusack being some Roman legion commander who has led his troops all the way across most of the (then) known world and ended up on the Chinese periphery. Right. Anyway without spoiling it too much the premise is that a couple of guys have to show real leadership and get their respective people to work together in order to stand against a third force - that third force being the real bad dudes.

As noted earlier the film looks good. It is well shot and isn't just a Jackie Chan vehicle. The international flavour really helps it and adds a scope to the film. Sure it's all ridiculously contrived and there are still some weird scenes where you don't really get the point but it was a brave attempt at trying some sort of epic and the fact that the foreigners are portrayed as cartoon like overacting morons is a nice touch. Someone turned the dial down on the Chinese xenophobe quota (though given the real bad dudes are other Romans probably got it the nod).

An interesting movie idea that stumbles a bit at reaching the level of 'epic-ness' it strives for but does try valiantly and it is noteworthy for being one of the rare latter day Chan movies that got any exposure at all outside of mainland China.",1525132800,,1451,4.447368421052632

I haven't seen a more disjointed,historically inaccurate & strangely childish view point as loose with factual events as this movie in a long time.

7413242,5,B014I67SGU,"I Love This Movie, a much more serious roll for Jackie Chan. No real funny moments per usual for a J.C. movie but a great film none the less. J.C.'s character I think you label a Warrior Saint, not a racist bone in his body. The first General with troops from various walks of life. The one enemy I would never under estimate, he was very resourceful and fighting skills among the top in that era. Witnessing his parents murder and accidentally killing his sister started a domino effect that set this characters life in motion to become the Hero of this war. John Cusak and Adrien Brody were awesome at their rolls to. John Cusak played an awesome General, compassionate Protector, Highly formidable opponent, and a truly loyal friend. As for Adrien Brody he did an amazing job playing the guy you love to hate, but you can't help respect the guys crazy abilities in sword play he mad it look so easy. This is a 5 Star movie in my book give it a chance. I hope you love it as much as I do!!!",1503360000,2,992,4.310160427807487

Cusack just doesn't have the screen presence to play the part of a Roman general. Brody over-acted his role. Chan was Chan. I apologize to his parents, but to me, the kid was creepy.
The ""dance off"" and sing-a-thon were the nails in the coffin for me. Reminded me of a 60s beach movie. Supporting actors weren't much support. Fight scenes were comical.  If you're easily drawn into any story, don't care about random wandering from the already illogical story, poor acting, poor directing, and want to see an over the top, cheezy, everybody loves everybody, low budget epic movie...then you might like this.",1500768000,,759,4.6992481203007515

7413251,4,B014I67SGU,"Featuring an international cast led by Jackie Chan, John Cusack and Academy Award(R) winner Adrien Brody, the film features the fight for the Silk Road when East and West collide. When corrupt Roman leader Tiberius (Adrien Brody) arrives with a giant army to claim the Silk Road, Huo An (Jackie Chan) and his warriors team up with defected Roman soldiers led by General Lucius (John Cusack) to protect his country and his new friends, Huo An gathers the warriors of thirty-six ethnic nations together to fight Tiberius. 2 problems I had. John Cusack as a Roman General, didn't and don't see it. Adrien Brody as Tiberius, whispered all the time, I couldn't hear him. except for that I loved it. Jackie Chan was SUPERB. The other actors were superb too. The action was terrific. This says it was based on a true story and now I must read about it this was so interesting. The direction and story....outstanding.

7413254,3,B014I67SGU,"This is another one proAsian pairing with Hollywood with the overt intent to gain access to the East.

Looking through the veil of commercialism in the extreme, this movie takes way more license than it should.  This is as historical as Pirates of the Caribbean and I waited for an autobot to transform into a heavy lift crane.  Kids will love it and I will serve to confuse and errode their understanding of history well into the future.  I suppose we cant be doomed to repeat historical mistakes we know nothing about, even if the result of willful ignorance.  All that could be waived if there was some entertainment value here, very little.  It's a combination of incomplete thoughts, driven by assumptions and very little effort to support a story at this pace.  The musical route would have been more suited application, but it will likely be adapted for Bollywood.",1490572800,4,871,4.766666666666667

7413262,3,B014I67SGU,"You may have come to this bit of an oddity drawn by any one of the three main actors: Jackie Chan, John Cusack, or Adrian Brody. For me it was Chan and while this most definitely is a Jackie pic Cusack also stands as the co-star. In fact the film focuses a lot of attention on Cusack who plays Lucius, a Roman general protecting a young charge, who has led his men across Chinas desert. His men are near exhaustion and in desperate need of supplies when they come against Wild Geese Gate, itself in disrepair though being repaired by a variety of different ethnic factions working essentially as slaves. They are going to lay siege to the gate to obtain goods when Huo An (Chan, the captain of a peace-keeping force that patrols the Silk Road on which this gate lies), battles Cusack to a standstill and they strike an accord: the Romans can be provided for if they don't fight, and they can help repair the Gate (think of this Gate as a large fortress between a small pass in the mountains, sort of like what you might find in one of the Lord of the Rings movies). An is a determined fighter capable of killing but believes that life should be protected and goes to precarious and dangerous lengths not to kill when possible while Lucius is a good fighter because hes a Roman general. Each fights after their own trained style and earns the respect of the other as they basically stalemate each other (not really, Chan wins) and they form a sympathetic bond of mutual admiration. Chans police force and Lucius company of men end up using their creative techniques and architectural skills to not just rebuild but enhance the defensive structure of Wild Geese Gate. But Lucius has been tracked down by Tiberius (Adrian Brody) who wants to slay his own young brother whom Lucius has been protecting. Tiberius is vicious and brutal and he will stop at nothing short of death to get the throne. Will he succeed?

If this sounds to you like a typical sword and sandal flick or some dry quasi-historical epic don't worry, its not. Though it certainly has those elements they are filtered through a Hong Kong lens with a desire to entertain and (I think) Chans desire to serve a message that though one may be a great fighter and though it may be easy to kill one should always be working toward peace, even if you have to sacrifice something to achieve it. Chans character embodies this ethos and it places him in a strange position in this film as it makes him both iconic and unbelievable at the same time. He practices great humility and suffers great loss over the films arc, so he is a tragic figure, but one who suffers and survives for all the right and righteous reasons. His character feels like they should exist in a much smaller film than this. Also for a western audience (myself included) its hard to understand the mindset of a group of essentially different ethnicities, all essentially slaves working for their Chinese masters at the Gate, with tensions between the groups but not a lot of hostility directed toward their masters though it seems they could easily overthrow them. Sure, they're getting paid but that sense of the community that exists there is just off. But it also helps bring out what I thought was one of the films more memorable traits: the galvanizing of the groups to work together even as the Romans were showing up Chans Silk Road peacekeepers as they were rebuilding the gate. That was a small part of the movie but kind of fun, and even interesting in how they went about solving the architectural difficulties. As for the action and fighting (as I mentioned earlier this is most definitely a JC film) its pretty mediocre, occasionally entertaining. Fans who learned to love Jackie from his early days or late 1980/ early 1990 Hong Kong movies may enjoy his presence but won't be treated to nearly the same level of incredible action. Hes just too old to carry it off anymore. And fans of Adrian Brody are going to be disappointed in his relatively small role where all he gets to do is connive and be mean.

So Dragon Blade stands as a bit of an oddity in the Chan oeuvre. Its an epic that doesnt feel epic; a sword and sandal flick filtered through a Chinese lens; a kung fu pic without particularly great action sequences (theyre okay) but a peaceful moral. I think that the next time I watch it Ill probably be able to enjoy it more because Ill know what Im looking for. As a one-time watch? 3.5 stars.",1487203200,,4444,4.533001245330013

This is the main reason why I watched this film. My initial reaction to this film was upbeat though after viewing the entire thing I had some questions that were left unanswered. The main question is in relations to the level of interaction between the Roman Empire and the Chinese ruling dynasties. Who initiated first contact? When did it first happen? Did the Silk Road jumpstart this process and serve as a connecting link between two powerful entities? How can I know for sure this film is based on historical facts?

The Orientals have to repair a fort in 15 days, so the Romans show them how to get it done. It does teach a great lesson on cooperation vs competition, and what can be accomplished when we work together rather than fight. Not a bad idea. It has a lot of gratuitous violence. This violence has more to do with its intended audience than anything, so I forgive this. And it is based on an unsubstantiated myth about  the Silk Road. There is no evidence to suggest that Romans got this far from home in any significant number. It's worth a watch, though.",1474416000,,689,4.468253968253968
7413289,3,B014I67SGU,"As others have said, historical accuracy plays no role in this movie. It is beautiful from a cinematographers point of view, but where the movie all falls apart for me is in the European art film way the movie is constructed with flashbacks and intercutting of scenes and sequences. The movie is complex enough with multiple plot lines, but the interplay of the flashbacks makes it impossible for me to get in the groove of the movie and just enjoy. The movie forces me to think instead and that makes me notice the pro Chinese bias of the film and the message the film is (pile)driving. Neither would be bad if they were subtle, especially if this movie were structured as a linear thoughtful action film. However, the way the movie doesn't flow forces me to constantly reconstruct and organize its pieces which, in turn, jams the movies biases and message into my awareness.

7413293,4,B014I67SGU,"WARNING: Jackie Chan may have starred, written, produced, and choreographed this epic, but its definitely NOT your typical Jackie Chan movie. This, more than anything else, pretends to be a historical drama.

An onscreen title at the beginning informs us this story is based on true events and also that a Roman legion fighting the Parthians disappeared. This apparently is the story of where they went.

In a total bending of history, for I decided to research all this afterward viewing the movie, this is a story more about greed, revenge, and a plea for peace and not for possession of the Silk Road as the theater blurb states. Either that or there was another TIberius roaming around the Eternal City during this time.

The Consul Crassus names his youngest son as his heir, causing the eldest, Tiberius, to murder his father and blind his baby brother.  A loyal Roman, Lucius takes his legion and flees with the child into China where he meets up with Huo An, leader of the Silk Road Protection Squad. They fight to exhaustion and call it a draw. Huo An gives Lucius and his men sanctuary in the Wild Geese Gate city he is helping to build.  They become allies, Chinese, Romans, Mongols, and men of at least three other countries banding together to rebuild the city, and when Tiberius appearstheir ideals are tested and the body count rises as all, including the Romans, defend it against the invader, for as they declare ""Romans never surrender."" EDven when fighting their own kind.

Although it does jump around a bit in its flashbacks, theres plenty of action. About two-thirds of the film is in subtitles.  Chans famous martial arts choreography is missing but he makes up for it with swordplay. Cusack is well-played as the battle-weary jaded Roman who struggles to protect the child in his care while his own philosophy is Make friends today, lose them tomorrow. Brodys barely visible in his first three scenes with no dialogue and the movie is almost over before he makes any kind of real appearance or even speaks. He does bring a villainous aspect to the role when hes finally allowed to.

I understand this film was well-received in China and its definitely a dramatic and bloody one when the battle finally starts. Its message that if individuals of different nations can achieve harmony then all nations should be able to do the same is blatant all the way through, making this by turns dramatic, nostalgic, corny, sentimental, and uplifting.  Good to see Jackie Chan can do something besides fight on the Eiffel Tower or use chairs, shoe laces, and other mundane items as weapons.

Its high inaccurate in its historical aspect but entertaining in all others.  Perhaps it also gets its message across a bit.

With that said this was not in their wheelhouse.  It may be just me but I cant picture chan in anything but a comedy action film.  I kept waiting for him to crack a smile or joke after his action scenes.  Cusack has made an art of acting awkward and was out of place.  Brody, well even his acting skills couldn't help him fit in.  Also, I know it sounds sappy but the perfect movie has a little of everything and this was missing the love story.

7413299,1,B014I67SGU,"Wow, what to say in a review of this film?

I'll start with what I actually enjoyed but it will be quite short. The fight scenes, those were beautifully choreographed and performed....that's pretty much it.

My husband and I sat down to watch this after having recorded it on our DVR. I thought this should be fun, Jackie Chan movies are generally at least fun with him in them due to his charisma and charm...but it fell so horribly flat. I knew this wouldn't have the comedy of many of the movies he's in but this just lacked emotion in general. I think I've finally figured out that what it really felt like to me....was the first run through of the script, where the actors sit down at a table and simply read through their lines. It was that flat.

I realize there are some who still thought it fun to watch even though it's accuracy with history is abysmal (I can look past that in movies) but I just didn't see what they saw...I looked for something redeeming, I just never saw it.

The story itself is a snooze fest that never comes together in anything close to a cohesive manner so that the viewer knows what's really going on or the motives behind it. It's full of flashbacks (to earlier in the movie, as in 15-20 minutes earlier) that in my view actually end up interrupting the flow and wastes time that could have been used to develop the story. The director seems to completely ignore the fact that the viewer knows what's happened already. It feels to me as though the director is going ""see, these two guys really do like each other and btw this is why they're teaming up...just to remind you."" If the director didn't manage to get the emotional impact through earlier in the movie...the flashbacks aren't going to achieve that for him later on and he's wasted the viewers time as well as the opportunity to actually develop the story itself.

Now, if I were the type to watch the movie and expect nothing more than cool fight scenes, I'd have been entertained...but honestly, I expect a decent story as well. Jackie Chan is a master at choreographing and directing fight scenes, everyone knows that....but you cannot make an entire movie based around that and that is truly what it felt like this director tried to do, using a story as a bit of an after thought.

As for the casting that was just as confusing. John Cusak in this film, was as horribly mis cast as Keifer Sutherland in Pompeii, what in the world were they thinking? He doesn't fit in this role AT ALL....there's absolutely no emotion, no believability at all to his character....he's completely one-dimensional and I generally like his acting. Adrian Brody on the other hand, in my view was just as badly cast. This award-winning actor was set back years by this role, he was often unintelligible; I felt like his scenes required sub-titles too just so we could understand what he was saying. I truthfully rarely understood his mumbling. Now, I won't say Jackie Chan was mis-cast, in fact I'd be willing to bet he was the first one cast and that the story was relying on him alone as the keystone but his character wasn't strong enough to anchor this movie. This director has done an amazing thing in the fact that he managed to completely squelched the personalities of three normally outstanding and charismatic actors with his directing style.

So please, don't waste your time on this one. It may look interesting but believe me....it's really not.

I honestly cannot recommend this movie....to anyone.",1468800000,,3490,4.617741935483871

7413307,2,B014I67SGU,"What a mess of a movie in Historical terms but at least it was entertaining.  The Romans look weird, their armor and weapons seem wrong. How could Roman armies transit from Europe to China through the Parthian empire without being totally massacred by the Parthians.  The premise was Crassus's botched campaign which resulted in the massacre of Carrhae in which 4 Roman legions where defeated by the Parthian cavalry lead by Surenas. Somehow after the massacre the Romans stumble into Western China to be confronted by another Roman Army led by Crassus's son, which is an impossibility in historical terms as the Romans never made out of the Euphrates valley alive.  Then they are caught by the Parthians that somehow allied themselves with the good romans lead by Cussack.  I heard about a Roman legion that somehow ended up in China but it was because after being defeated by the Parthians they were sent as slaves to garrison duties in Parthia's Eastern borders and from there they scaped to China but not as the film suggests.  When you are going to disregard history in such a way why not make it an entire fictional movie in a fictional time and a fictional place at least you don't owe anything to historical accuracy this way and the movie could be better, but when you purposefully destroy history in that way you make a laughable enterprise and destroy the movie.  As far as pure entertainment it had its redeeming qualities but you really have to shut your brain out and disregard everything you know about history to enjoy it.",1467072000,2,1538,4.741573033707865

What killed it for me at the very beginning was that all of sudden Jackie Chan can speak English! There was the stereotypical halting and slow talk, as if doing that means a foreigner can understand English. So way back in the day of Rome, somehow, a full blooded Chinese can speak halting English.

Although the start of the movie asserts that this story is based upon real events I am afraid that is a big pile of you-know-what. There is virtually no history here. The Roman army that ""disappeared"" belonged to Crassus and it didn't disappear. It was slaughtered. Less than a third survived and those survivors returned to Roman territory. The rest were dead or sold as slaves. There was no mighty, invincible  Roman army to march on the Silk Road. And the costume designers might have picked up a book on Roman armor, etc., before creating the costumes. There are plenty of them out there they could have referred to.

7413358,3,B014I67SGU,"The idea is quite unique. Jackie Chan and John Cusack are in a Chinese period action. Set in 50 BC, Dragon Blade features Chan as Huo An, an idealistic border guard sent to a remote fort, where he meets Lucius (Cusack), leader of a defeated Roman legion. They become friends, but their friendship is tested when another army appears, led by Tiberius (Adrien Brody).

Apparently the story is inspired by true events, but, you know, we should forget about any historical accuracy here. You just should not expect it when Huo An and Lucius can communicate each other pretty easily in modern English. Still the on-location photography is beautiful and the sets and costumes look great, so what else do you want?

Of course, what we want is action, and the biggest disappointment for me happens to be that part. Action scenes are just OK. They are not boring, but they are also devoid of any style. With cardboard characters and non-existent storyline, we somehow stop caring whatever happens to them.

Dragon Blade is written and directed by Daniel Lee, who is responable for such films as Jet Lis Black Mask and Donnie Yens 14 Blades. Those who have seen them should know what they would see: so-so action with a big star.",1456876800,,1219,4.713615023474178

Lately, in search of more and more stuff to watch, I have found that I enjoy SOME of the newer stuff being put out by the Asian Film genre....if you don't mind reading subtitles through the whole thing. Some are worse about that than others, but some of the really cool ones are rated very good; four stars, four and half stars....But it is tedious to have to read the dialog as the action is going on. And at first, I thought this was going to be one of those. But luckily, when Jackie Chan met the Roman soldiers, their were long breaks where everyone spoke English (no matter how heavily accented, it's still better than speed reading a movie. The filming and audio were great. No short cuts there, so it was a visually exciting movie, and Jackie still has his moves! And the rest of the cast was great! I'm going to re-read the trivia and get their names because they deserve the nod. I've seen the other two core actors in a bunch of good movies, I'm just terrible with names (sorry)
  So here's the deal: The atrocities of war are vicious and cruel, but in this movie completely different people's find out that they can be like brothers. The Romans need to pass, the Asian people's are under tremendous stress to finish a huge defensive gate and castle with the threat of death if it's not completed. This vid had TONS of action and cool fighting, lots of weapons, of course martial art. AND ALSO, shield and sword war skills as well (think SPARTA!) Don't mis this vid.

7413411,2,B014I67SGU,"A disappointing amateur film that ignores too many facts. Although there is evidence that survivors of a Roman legion might have reached the Great Wall of China about 50 years before the birth of Christ during the Han Dynasty, a Roman army with 100,000 troops never reached China ever---that was pure fiction. But ""Genetic testing of villagers in a remote part of China has shown that nearly two thirds of their DNA is of Caucasian origin, lending support to the theory that they may be descended from a 'lost legion' of Roman soldiers,"" reported The Telegraph in the UK.

Until the middle of the first century, about 5,000 men made up a Roman legion. In addition, by the end of Augustus' reign in AD 14, the imperial Roman army numbered about 250,000 men. The film made it seem as if China would be helpless if this fictional Roman army of 100,000 troops lead by the evil general in the film breached the Great Wall.

None of the following facts were mentioned in the film:

The military forces of the Han dynasty was said to have used the most advance forms of weaponry during that time. Swords were a favored weapon and the improvement in iron casting and working during the Han period made it possible for them to produce stronger swords. Improvements were also made to the traditional crossbow making it more accurate and powerful. The army began to adapt stirrups to gain greater balance riding horses.

Because of the power of the Han dynasty military, they were able to rid China of many enemies and even enabled the kingdom to spread its influence over larger areas across Asia. From what I've read, the Han Dynasty had an army between 700,000 and one million troops.

There is evidence that some Roman troops had crossbows but that weapon was not used extensively like it was in China, and the Roman cavalry at that time did not have stirrups. The use of paired stirrups is credited to the Chinese Jin Dynasty and came to Europe during the Middle Ages---long after the Roman Empire was gone.",1453680000,4,2001,4.657223796033994

One of the saddest things for me as a movie lover is to find people who won't open themselves up to watching movies that might not be in their comfort zone. Im talking about young people with no sense of history who refuse to watch black and white films and others who refuse to watch anything with subtitles. For the latter it paints that picture of the ugly American who thinks that the world should revolve around all things U.S.A. and we shouldnt have to deal with other cultures. In so doing those people miss out on some terrific movies. Not always, but on occasion.

Which leads me to this weeks release of DRAGON BLADE, the newest movie to star Jackie Chan. Having made his mark in numerous martial arts and comedy films, Chan turns here to a historical drama concerning the Han dynasty in China. Chan stars as Huo An, a warrior who leads a group in protecting the Silk Road in China. If you're not familiar with the Silk Road it was a network of trade routes that connected regions of Asia with other countries to the west of China, eventually including Europe. Here Chan and his group protect the road from the 36 nations that travel it trying to keep the peace by preventing fighting rather than involving themselves in battle.

All of this falls apart when Chan and his group are framed for smuggling illegal goods. Theyre sentenced to work in the rebuilding of a town for the Emperor. Once there Chan finds the struggle for people to get along with one another a constant battle. Representatives of the 36 nations have been sent here to work together on this project and each one fights with another. Chan finally gets them to calm down at least when a new problem presents itself.

A Roman legion is coming in off of the desert led by Lucius (John Cusack), leader of the order of the Black Eagle. Transporting a child leader of the Roman Empire and wanting for food and water, he challenges Huo An to a fight. Huo tries to persuade him to go peacefully but the two begin to battle. An approaching sandstorm gets their attention and a draw is called while Huo allows Lucius and his men to enter the city. Peace works.

Word reaches the city that the ruler wants the repairs to the city and its walls completed in 15 days, an impossible task. In return for shelter and food Lucius and his men join forces and provide methods to accomplish the goal in time. The Roman soldiers and Huos men become friends and comrades as they set about their task.

Lucius eventually tells Huo how they came to be there. His young charge Publius was the son of the ruler of Rome. He was blinded and an attempt made on his life by his brother Tiberius (Adrien Brody). Now Lucius and his men are on the run with Tiberius and his legions hot on their trail. Huo agrees to provide them with a place to stay but eventually Tiberius is bound to show. Couple that with some traitorous moments among the Chinese leaders and the battle at hand is sure to be massive.

The movie takes a time in history and uses quite a bit dramatic license. But at least the makers of the film are up front about that during the opening credits. Yes there was a Silk Road, yes there was a Huo with a different last name and several other items can be searched for online. But the heart of the story is less about the events that happened and more about the battle of good versus evil and trying to find a common ground for all to work from, a peaceful harmony of people rather than a constant state of war. That the Romans and the Chinese in the story can do so proves it is indeed possible.

The action sequences are exactly what one would expect from a Jackie Chan film with tremendous two person combat as well as huge battle sequences. As is always the case we learn in the extras that yes, Chan did indeed injure himself at least once during the filming of the movie. Watching the sequences between Chan and Cusack and Brody I found myself wondering how much was done by the actors themselves and how much by stunt people. With Chan around Im guessing a lot was done by the actors inspired by his performance.

The film offers a great story with more tragedy than you would expect and of course a ton of heroism that inspires. Its a niche that Chan has sown up nicely over the past few years. Themes of honor and a resolve to do what is right are rarely found in most movies these days so it was nice to witness that as well. Short of 300 that hasn't been seen as often as one would think. That it could be done in what would rate a film of epic proportions like this makes it even more special.

All that being said there is one thing which I mentioned earlier that will drive some away. Subtitles. The film is a Chinese production. Yes, some actors speak in English but for the most part youll be reading the lines of the actors. Dont let that deter you from enjoying this film. It is a good movie. Be daring enough to give a foreign film with subtitles a try. In doing so youll experience the world through the eyes of another country.",1453334400,2,5067,4.358050847457627

7413442,2,B014I67SGU,"Recently, I had the dubious ""opportunity"" to view ""Dragon Blade"" starring Jackie Chan, John Cusack and Adrien Brody.

The villain, Tiberius, played by Adrien Brody, is a fictional son of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the 1st century BCE triumvir, who is chasing down his baby brother Publius, a child of about 9, because the senior Crassus preferred Publius over Tiberius as his heir.  (in history Publius, a fully adult cavalry commander, died fighting with his father at the battle of Carrhae).

Perhaps Tiberius is supposed to be a nickname for Marcus Crassus Jr. who was the eldest son of Crassus Sr but was so undistinguished that historians have argued maybe, despite his name, he was not the eldest after all.  Anyway, Crassus Jr. never made it to the east as far as we can tell from history.  Instead he spent a rather lackluster career serving under Julius Caesar in Gaul then was later appointed governor of Cisalpine Gaul.  Marcus Crassus Jr. is mainly remembered as the man who married the Caecilia Metella whose tomb remains along the Via Appia is so popular with tourists.  Supposedly he had a fearsome reputation among the Parthians, though.  The Augustan historian Pompeius Trogus, of the Celtic Vocontii, said that the Parthians feared especially harsh retribution in any war won against them by Caesar, because the surviving son of Crassus would be among the Roman forces, seeking revenge for the deaths of his father and brother.  But, as we all know, Caesar never made it to Parthia and Crassus Jr. didn't either.

John Cusack plays ""the greatest warrior in the empire"" (a la Gladiator's Maxiumus) who whisked young Publius out of the clutches of Tiberius and, with a small contingent of legionaries, has fled with the child east along the Silk Road to the outskirts of the Han Dynasty.

Jackie Chan reprises his often played role as the wise but good-natured leader of a band of battle-weary warriors charged with keeping the peace along the Silk Road.  Chan's character no longer believes that violence settles anything so each time he is forced into fighting someone who is striking viciously at him with swords and other nasty weapons, he fends them off with comical facial expressions accompanied by deft deflections off of his breastplate and a small metal shield worn on his forearm.

After one such encounter, Chan's little troop returns home to find their villainous greedy governor has framed them and sentenced them to forced labor repairing the fortification walls of a Han outpost.  There they collide with John Cusack's group, make friends then face off together against the evil Tiberius.

I was hoping this was going to be a more realistic story about the so-called ""Forgotten Legion"" (of Ben Kane fame) from the Battle of Carrhae that were rumored to have been taken captive by the Parthians and subsequently traded to the Han Chinese and settled in Liqian in the north central province of Gansu.  After all, I've seen the History Channel, Nat Geo and PBS programs about the Chinese villagers with European physical traits and the European-looking mummies found in China, too.  But, instead we get a ridiculous story with theatrically flamboyant characters wearing totally unrecognizable armor (except for the helmet crest) in slashing battles with short swords (?) like ill-trained barbarians singing soaring arias supposedly in Latin that sound more like the vocals of a Byzantine church choir.

I must admit, the sword fights between Cusack and Chan then later Chan and Brody were impressive. Cusack was even convincing as a physically powerful hero type even though he usually plays characters more adept with their brain than their brawn.  But that is about the only praise I can give this historical disaster of a movie.",1452902400,,3758,5.012861736334405

Please tell me someone found an old Chinese contract that read Chan HAD to make this movie.  It was so bad. It wasn't even fun to watch, which I do expect from this kind of movie. Don't even try to think about it as a historical drama. It's like they took a bunch of famous, historical names from different times and famous battles and smooshed them all together in a jumbled mess, not to mention Rome never even fought China!  Crassus lost a doozy of a one in Parthia, but never signed a treaty with them; Parthia put his own son's head on a spike!

I wound up not even watching the whole thing, it was so bad.  What the heck did have to do with a dragon blade?  I kept waiting for a famous sword to show up, but no go - even if that sword was just historically famous.  The title seemed totally random and unrelated to the story.  I thought it was going to be an ancient Chinese legend story.  It wasn't at all. It was all just a random mish-mash of fighting.

Unfortunately, it's downhill from there.  The plot is disjointed and cliched, the dialogue is corny, and the movie sputters on from one action scene to the next.  But sadly, the action / battle scenes are tired and derivative -- I suppose they will be amusing to someone who has not seen too many Chinese ""sword & history"" movies, or has never watched a Jackie Chan flick.  I am afraid most others will find the scenes unimaginative and formulaic.

Maybe it's just me, but the last scene (a showdown between the two main characters) struck me as a very poor copy of Ridley Scott's Gladiator.  Again, tired and entirely derivative.

7413453,2,B014I67SGU,"Well, after finish watching this movie I was totally disappointed. First of all, the movie is supposed to be in English according to the language audio options. I'd say about 60% of this movie is in Chinese with almost impossible to read subtitles. John Cusack performance is good but he speaks English the entire movie--when he is the leading Roman commander. And Jackie Chan speaks in Chinese about 70% of the movie. I always say, with movies, it is better to have a dubbed version than reading subtitles. Another thing I did not like about this movie was the fact that it DOES NOT have good scene transition sequences. While I was watching this movie it seemed like there were no pauses. In other words, it very much felt like I was watching a live theater presentation at an auditorium.  This movie has a great cast but poor directing. Daniel Lee is the director of this movie. I've only seen a couple of movies he has directed like: ""Black Mask"" and ""14 Blades"" but this one is probably one of his worst.",1452038400,,1009,4.543956043956044

Of course there is the requisite and quite distraught man yelling ""Teacher! Teacher!"" when his mentor is in danger. No kung-fu movie is complete without that plot entry.

The plot was quite disjointed and a couple of the Roman soldiers had Fabio type hair, all perfect waves and 80s style wings. Tiberius had perfect ringlets? And the Parthenian woman had an  American accent? Jackie Chan did some ""singing"" too. God help us.

The whole thing was laughable but it was something to kill time with. So I can finish this review on a positive note, I'll say that I liked the scenery in the movie and I liked seeing the end credits roll.",1452038400,3,808,4.676056338028169
7413455,3,B014I67SGU,"The story is a little underdeveloped. And the entire beginning is subtitled which makes it hard to really watch what is going on because you have to keep reading the dialogue. I understand why, but I probably wouldn't have gotten this if I had known how much of the movie you have to ""read"". getting into the description of the movie, so **spoilers** ahead. Nothing is ever fully explained. Not what Jackie Chans group is, how they were formed, or why they feel they should protect silk road. First they seem independent of the other ""clans"" and then some ""government"" throw them in prison.  So what exactly is his group? Volunteer firefighters? It makes no sense. while you understand the romans that ""fled"" their commander that side is never really explained either. Okay their ""leader"" blinded his brother and John Cusak was supposed to protect him, so they fled. Why was the Adrian body's character so nuts? Why was he even allowed to be close to his brother if they were already aware that he killed his father? Why wasn't he arrested? it makes no sense. I like the relationship that develops between the romans and the people in the ""prison"" town (?) which again makes no sense and is never explained. and then Jackie chan goes off to find allies but that is implied, and you don't really see him doing anything, he goes back home for what? and then his wife is killed and the group that shows up to help him comes from where? The chick didn't show up in the prison town, so when did she start following him? or why wait so long to go find him? again it makes no sense. And John Cusak being captured... It just doesn't jive. How that all went down... He was supposedly this great fighter and commander and pretty much fell for a trap that was easy to spot, and then dies. It's pointless. It makes his character pretty useless to the story. same thing with the guy jumping off with the kid. Why kill your brother now? If that was the plan the whole time why blind him before instead of just killing him outright. Again it just isn't plausible or the story as it is told is just really poorly done. The battle scene at the end, awful. Jackie Chan is supposed to be awesome, and granted he's hurt, but the few scenes where Adrian Brody is fighting... it's clear he is the best fighter. which goes against the story. There were enjoyable moments and parts and I'm a huge Jackie Chan and John Cusack fan, but this movie was just poorly done.",1452038400,3,2442,4.4630872483221475

The original movie was available in Dolby 5.1 and even 7.1 in selected theaters, it's hard to understand why multiple soundtracks were not included.

What more if you are watching it 7.1 or 9.1 system?

About 30 minutes later we get introduced to our second major character, General  Lucius (John Cusack) and for the next 30 minutes they unite to fortify a city and practice their fighting skills, because all the fighting in the first thirty minutes was just Asians.  Then after an hour we have the Battle for Mordor against Tiberius (Adrien Brody) an ominous figure.

The film is a ""could of"" happened type pseudo-history.  I found the plot to be bogged down and the fight sequences ridiculously long and plentiful.  Now I will admit they spent money on sets and costumes but kept the dialogue exceeding dry. The Romans native tongue was Latin, and the Chinese spoke Chinese and everyone spoke English, with Huo An speaking  broken English...why?

The film is a fight film for tweens and teens, particularly those who like martial arts and war films.

They are so similar that they become boring.

7413531,3,B014I67SGU,"The film was entertaining enough, but irritated me on a number of levels.

Acting - There were a number of problems I had after watching this, but the thing I was unable to ignore throughout was the acting of the English-speaking characters except Adrien Brody & Jackie Chan. Everybody else from Cusack to the Parthian Queen just sounded so forced and cheesy. It breaks what little immersion is left in the film from all of the historical inaccuracies.

Historical Inaccuracies - When your opening credits say ""inspired by true events"", one expects a degree of adherence to historical accuracy greater than ""this story has Romans, Chinese, Arabs, Huns, and Indians in it."" Please don't let me think this film is going to be largely historically accurate, and then open with a modern-day scene that features extremely futuristic technology that holographically reconstructs ancient ruins in the middle of snowstorms.

I enjoy ancient/medieval history so it was also personally off-putting to see Romans running around in immaculately gilded armor, spears (instead of pila), swords, crossbows, and solid-metal shields. Consuls weren't technically appointed by their predecessors. Parthia wasn't ever so friendly to Rome (& certainly not to Crassus) to allow 100,000 troops through their country. etc.

Scope - I felt the film didn't have the time/budget/skill to really develop much of anything. It's very generic, but admittedly gets the job done more or less.

The film's main theme - unity/understanding between diverse people groups - was hindered by fact that there are 36-37 people groups that are supposed to be involved. The film can barely squeeze alleged tidbits of Chinese and Roman culture - both cultures have their own songs/martial arts. What makes the Arab peoples unique? What makes the Huns unique? What makes the Indians unique? Well, the Arabs wear blacks, dark browns/reds/yellows, and have scimitars. The Huns have pseudo-dreadlocks, furs, and bows. The Indians wear white and have mace-ax things.

The main theme of achieving harmony is a lot less potent when the groups brought together don't actually have anything separating them other than an extremely general dislike. They technically all speak different languages, but this isn't ever an issue in the film for practicality reasons.

Plot - I really was not a fan of the modern time-line plot. It didn't add anything to the film's theme/plot, & broke immersion. The film could have used more time for development on the ""historical"" main plot, but instead wasted the time on an undeveloped romantic couple that I couldn't care less about. The main plot though is moderately coherent.

All in all, if you're looking for an ok action film, you might consider watching this film. If you are looking a more historically accurate and overall better Chinese war film, check out ""Red Cliff"".",1443830400,,2861,5.190889370932755
7413532,4,B014I67SGU,"Great movie, Jackie Chan never fails to deliver, but I was REALLY impressed to see John Cusack's performance, he's been lost in the hollywood scene for a while, great to see he still has it.

7413535,1,B014I67SGU,"I wasn't expecting much, but sheesh.  I started to get annoyed the moment it displayed ""based on true events"".
1. The ""true event"" it purports to be inspired by, is a legend and there is no solid evidence to back it up.  So it goes, after Marcus Crassus was defeated by the Parthians at Carrhae captured Roman soldiers were pressed into service by the Parthians, captured again by Parthian enemies and pressed into service against the Chinese.  Again, this is legend and there is no hard evidence backing up Romans ever fighting the Chinese.  Let alone entire Roman legions finding their way out there....
2. If you want to make a movie ""inspired"" by alleged true events strive for a little historical accuracy.  The Roman attire looked like some weird Asian Western hybrid.  Roman soldiers of that period would have worn lorica hamata (chain mail) and a gallic helmet.
3.  What the hell is up with that kid? They seem to imply Rome was an imperial power and this kid a potential emperor when in reality (while the time was coming) Rome was still a republic during this period.
4.  Overall cheesy as well.  I looked up what Cusack and Brody had been up to film wise lately and it looks like their careers are going the way of the likes of Val Kilmer and Nick Cage where they will do what ever B direct to video crap will pay them.",1443484800,,1330,4.485477178423237
7413536,5,B014I67SGU,"I'm a professional ancient historian and can assure everyone that accuracy is not part of the equation here. The plot is often incoherent and one gets the impression that their background research consisted of watching Gladiator a couple of times. The moral is dropped repeatedly like an anvil tied to a quasi-Vitruvian crane onto the audience, and the revisionism and Chinese nationalism is pretty thickly spread.

But. Oh, but. If you take it for what it is - a big, hammy movie with its heart firmly located in the right place - then this is an incredibly fun watch. I was not bored, and was often touched/ entertained. Yes, it's corny. Yes, it's wildly inaccurate. No, you can't do that with swords and that Mainz-type gladius is rendered unusable by the gorgon head inexplicably soldered to the haft, and Parthia of the first century BCE was not ruled by a woman. Carrhae had nothing to do with a dynastic struggle between Crassus brothers over the consulship (what? WHAT?), and Crassus was SO not in Parthia to sign a peace treaty! Rome did not, as it happens, have a national anthem (but the movie gets points for passable Latin grammar in said anthem). I could go on, but again, that's not the point.

The sincere wish to tell a story about how East, West, and places in between can learn to treat each other with respect gives the scenery-chewing campiness a likability that makes the inaccuracy kind of fun. It's a heck of a lot better than the Disney Hercules or that awful Eagle movie; I anticipate some very interesting conversations with my students about this thing.",1443398400,87,1581,4.72463768115942

All the actors in the film, Adrian Brody, John Cusack, and Jackie Chan, I have truly enjoyed their films, and was truly different to see Adrian Brody play such a sinister role.  John Cusack character was really good, and was awesome to see him play such strong character in the film.  The film contain many twist and unexpected plot turns that keep me guessing what was going to happen.  I truly didn't think that the film was end as it did, but it meet my expectations.  Every action scene was awesome and there was funny parts of the movie that had me laughing.

Pity that they could not make a better film out of an interesting, if dubious historical theory. Pity. They say the problem with pity parties is very few people come, and those who do don't bring presents. Presents. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is God's gift, that's why we call it the present.",1441929600,,492,4.72093023255814

It was ridiculous, and apparently the director's cut has more scenes because the story did not flow at all. And I fell a sleep for a bit but it didn't make a difference because they had already cut it down so much I was already lost. But we did laugh so we were entertained a bit. But I still wonder how this movie got made with John Cusack and Adrien Brody. Jackie Chan, I understand, but there wasn't even much of his slapstick fighting style. If you really NEED to see it, you can wait til FX airs it. It seems like that kind of movie.

7413600,4,B014I67SGU,"The emergence of China as the dominant motion picture market has led to an increase in Western stars appearing in Chinese productions. The result has been an influx of Hollywood stars, some major and some not-so-major, starring in films that largely appeal to the Asian audience, whether they are cultural dramas, grand-scaled historical epics, or cheesy comedies. Daniel Lee's Dragon Blade, already a global blockbuster with $120M in China alone, is a strangely entertaining mix of all three, thrusting the odd combination of Jackie Chan, John Cusack, and Adrien Brody into the unfamiliar realm of swords 'n sandals warfare.

First of all, the visuals alone are both jaw-dropping and kind of hilarious. It's tough to get over that you're watching Chan in a sword duel with Cusack because it's both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. Lee, who has taken much smaller budgets than the $65M allotted here and created massive spectacles, puts every penny to good use in detailing war-torn China of the Han Dynasty. After a cornball prologue set in the present, we're transported back 48 B.C. where Huo An (Chan) is the earnest and kind-hearted leader of the Silk Road Protection Squad, a loose knit group whose job is pretty obvious based on their title. Huo, an orphaned Hun who was taken in by Chinese general Huo Qubing, was raised with a respect for all tribes in the region, and fights selflessly to maintain harmony along the crucial Silk Road.

While only about 100 minutes in length, the vast majority of the first hour is gorgeously-detailed setup. Huo and his men are framed for gold smuggling and exiled to Wild Goose Gate where they are forced to rebuild an entire city in two weeks or be executed.  An impossible task; but fortune smiles on them when a lost Roman army led by rogue general Lucius (Cusack) arrives and picks a fight. A battle ensues between Lucius and Huo, but the two end up becoming best buds, with lots of singing, drinking, parades, and corny expressions of mutual respect. It turns out Lucius is on the run with an ailing boy, Publius (Joey Jozef), the rightful heir to the Roman throne and target for assassination by his vile brother, Tiberius (Brody), who already murdered their father.  With the aid of Lucius men and other local tribes, Huo turns the city into a symbol of the peace hes long fought for.

Put into a historical context, the film is about as accurate as Zack Snyder's 300, meaning not at all. But that's par for the course for Lee, who chose entertainment over accuracy with 2008's Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon. Once again it proves to be a wise move, as the film is never long without action or drama. The battles, of which there are many, are unique in that they combine Roman fighting techniques with traditional Chinese martial arts, a visual that never gets boring. There's also something refreshing in the friendship that emerges between Huo and Lucius, two outcasts from different lands with similar codes of honor. What doesn't always work are the endless number of songs and heavy-handed expressions of tribal unity, which only slow down the film's momentum.  A comedic subplot involving Huo's mistaken marriage to Cold Moon (Lin Peng) begins as a distraction but pays dividends as she becomes deeply entwined in the fight against Tiberius.

It's inescapable that the sight of Brody and Cusack as Roman gladiators is going to be a little bit funny, but at least Cusack settles nicely into a role he's rarely, if ever, been called on to play. Brody, on the other hand, is hilariously awful as Tiberius. Sporting a wild mane of hair and practically foaming at the mouth in every scene, it's like he just graduated from the Nicolas Cage school of B-movie overacting. Chan continues to be a dynamic force even at his advanced age. He's basically playing the same nice-guy role that he always plays, but he does it well and his martial arts skills are still a lot of fun to watch.

Not since John Woo's incredible Red Cliff has a major Chinese war film made much of an impact in the United States. Dragon Blade has a pretty good shot at changing that with Brody, Cusack, and Chan, who is more popular here than his American co-stars, at the top of the marquee.",1441584000,17,4234,4.766712141882674

The ridiculous plot could be overlooked if there were any redeeming qualities to the film.  Terrible editing, boring fight scenes, just bad all around.  Jackie makes an effort in the fight scenes, but he's slowing down in his older years.  There are plenty of warnings in the bad reviews this movie has received; read them.

7413607,5,B014I67SGU,"The film is great. If I could, I'd give it million stars. The plot, inspired by historical events is well written with twists and carries poignant message. Outstanding cinematography, mesmerising music score, suspenseful, skilfully choreographed battle scenes. Shot on location (the desert is real not CGI) and the cast is excellent.

Jackie Chan's powerful performance showcases his wide range of acting abilities. At the beginning he entertains us with martial arts and comedy but as the story unfolds, his role becomes dramatic and Jackie makes the transition with subtlety. Once again he proves that he is not just an action star, but also a very fine, accomplished drama actor.
John Cusack rates high and Adrian Brody impresses with his portrayal of Tibeirus, a sadistic and corrupt Roman Emperor.

The plot:
In 2015 an American archaeological company bought military manuscript from the Hun Dynasty, which said that Roman soldiers went to China about 2,000 years ago and built a city called Regum. The company believed that the manuscript is fake, but set on a journey to investigate. Two of its stuff found Regum. Among the ruins they discovered a monument with detailed inscription which as they read, fades into the main story.

China in 48 BC. Jackie Chan is Huo An, a Hun, serving as the captain of the Protection Squad Silk Road.
John Cusack is Lucius, a Roman general, who flees to the east with his legion and Publius, a heir of the ruling Roman Consul. They run for their lives from the Emperor Tiberius. At the frontier fort on Silk Road they meet Huo An. The legion helps finish construction of the fort.

In the mean time Tiberius and his army, who have pursued Lucius along the Silk Road, approaches the fort with intend to capture and control the Silk Road. An epic battle begins, which ends with dramatic & deadly one-on-one combat.
Back in the present, the two archaeologists are deeply moved by the story and have to make decision.

I envy my American friends for the priviledge they have to simply pop up to the nearest cinema and experience Jackie Chan's magic! Go and see it. A chance in a life time!",1441411200,4,2126,4.813698630136987
