7862091,5,6304111061,Long time Star Trek fan. I like the Deep Space Nine incarnation the best of all the Star Trek TV shows,1385683200,,102,3.9047619047619047
7862092,5,6304111061,"Plot:  The Enterprise is en-route to Q'onos, the Klingon homeworld so that Picard may complete his role as the ""Arbitar of Succession"".  Gowron, the primary candidate to fill the role as Chancellor, intercepts the Enterprise, warning them that the Duras sisters are up to something.  Worf, meanwhile, has finally decided to tell Gowron what really happened at Khitomer (that is was Duras' father and not Worf's, who betrayed to the Romulans that resulted in the massacre).  He asks for his family's honor back, but is denied it for the time.  Back to Capt. Picard:  Things start really heating up just as Picard is about to declare Gowron as Klingon Chancellor.  Apparently, Duras had a son, although he was never known to have a wife.  Worf then offers Gowron several Klingon squadrons in exchange for his family's honor....

Earns 5 stars for several reasons:  This is a continuation of the Enterprise's involvment in the affairs of the Klingon Empire and has a twist that falls all the way back to Yesterday's Enterprise...but I won't give away why.  Also, there's plenty of action (as in the starships exploding type action).

Great episode.",1157673600,,1145,4.968421052631579
