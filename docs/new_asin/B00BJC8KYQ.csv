5635012,4,B00BJC8KYQ,"What a wonderful documentary, to think that the magazines of the 1960's and 70's were, in large part, responsible for the gay world to come out of the closet. Toby ross does a great job in showing us the path that were taken by men to at least see the things that we were striving to connect with. Was this pornography? As the very narrow minded government officials were trying to make it be. Was it art? as so many gay men wanted it to be. Was it dirty? As the vast majority of the American people wanted it to be. I think these pictures and magazines were the impetus to spur a minority to make the movies to become recognized and human beings who love and wish to be loved. God bless all these guys, photographers, editors and models alike.",1435190400,10,744,4.283687943262412
5635013,5,B00BJC8KYQ,"Toby Ross has created an excellent documentary film detailing the history of physique magazines and movies.  His primary focus in this film is the period from 1969 to 1973.
Popular models such as Bill Eld and Ray Fuller are discussed, as well as the primary studios of the day: Athletic Model Guild, Champion, and others.
Toby also dares to discuss the ""chicken hawks,"" a subject so many are afraid to deal with.  But he deals with the subject factually and helps put it all in perspective.
We are shown how the focus went from the erotic to the blatantly sexual, and ended what is now referred to as the golden age of physique photography.",1431993600,7,640,4.605263157894737
5635014,5,B00BJC8KYQ,"Toby Ross describes PAPER DREAMS in the opening credits as
A loving look back at turn-ons that changed our lives. It is that and so much more. Its the story how dirty pictures in magazines evolved into gay self-identity and pride.

This is a remarkable documentary that is unlike anything Ive ever seen before. PAPER DREAMS chronicles male pornography from the 1960s loincloth era through the 1970s and just before HIV/AIDS epidentic.  The scholarship is impeccable, sort of like a doctoral dissertation.  This is a PBS worthy history film that borrows as much from Ken Burns as Gus Van Sant.  Toby Ross is a true curator and historian.

PAPER DREAMS is also technical success. The video and audio quality is far, far superior to the typical gay porn film.  The soundtrack is luscious and warm.  The editing is flawless; the narrator is a good storyteller with an impish impulse.  The archival footage makes this film a must see.  Years from now it will be shown college classes and libraries. PAPER DREAMS is perhaps the finest gay porn documentary ever made.

My favorite chapter in the film is Hopes and Dreams, the early 1970s go-go years when young men from around the world tripped-out to San Francisco and LA.  They came for the vibes, the mind expansion and to fulfill their sexual desires.  These young men caused a sensation in magazine and movie sales because they looked like the guy next door.  Maybe they were the guy next door.  It was possible.

PAPER DREAMS felt like pages from my own life.  I was that sweaty, nervous teen boy buying a gay porn magazine at a seedy dirty book store. Like Toby Ross, these magazines told me of a world somewhere and inspired him to go there.  Toby Ross captures that freedom in PAPER DREAMS.

The film centers on Ross own story. He began his gay porn career in 1973 as a photographer and magazine publisher.  My favorite scene is one where Ross appears on camera as a TV reporter in the mod 1970s. The film is a screen test for a new male model. Ross uses it to talk about the mind of a photographer.

Another of my favorite scenes, early in the film, shows with the beefcake era.  A simple loop from the period of one hunky model is combined with the song Alley Oop by The Hollywood Argyles.  (Kim Fowley would have been proud of Ross use of it.)  Toby Ross is a master at setting a time and place with music.  For example, an instrumental version of Everybodys Talking from the 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy behind images from exact same moment.

Absolutely the films greatest achievement is that it humanizes the models.  Ross talks about the young men he filmed and photographed  who they were as people. He says their names and shares their backstories. We get to know the real person as we crave him.  PAPER DREAMS is about hopes, dreams, and dignity.",1431648000,13,2805,4.600806451612903

5635016,5,B00BJC8KYQ,"I didn't buy this movie through Amazon but bought it locally.  However, I'm glad to see Amazon sells it so I'm rating it.  There are some good movies out there where husbands and wives struggle with issues such as miscarriages and/or delayed pregnancies but in the end they wind up getting their child or children.  Other movies show husbands and wives where they don't have biological children but have successful adoptions.  But what about a movie where a husband and wife struggle with infertility and decide to go with an adoption plan only to have that plan fail?  This movie is that movie!  This is the movie that was meant for my wife and me as it is our life story!  The only difference for us and this couple is that my wife and I have miscarried multiple times while the couple in the movie could not get pregnant at all.  However, being unable to conceive and miscarrying both fall under the category of infertility.  In the end, it is not a life we would choose but like the movie, we must realize that God is enough.  For some reason God does not bless all husbands and wives with children and it's not always because it's a lack of faith; neither is the reason made clear.  For those who are dealing with infertility, buy this movie!",1419465600,6,1247,4.4734513274336285

8569526,5,B00BJC8KYQ,"wow!!! There are just not enough biblically based stories out there that are soaked in the truth, ""He is truly all we need"". This was a very different, refreshing,heart tugging story that just reminds me that whether married or not, children or not, God is still good and is a good good Father! Sometimes in life we don't always get exactly what we dream for or even pray for, BUT that doesn't negate His love or His plan or His goodness for us!!! When we can rest in that promise, we then can be truly satisfied!",1506470400,,513,4.354166666666667
8569527,5,B00BJC8KYQ,"Paper Dreams isn't perfect, but it's worth the money for all of the beautiful pictures. Why can't guys have natural bushes these days? I loved seeing all of that beautiful hair!",1499644800,,177,4.741935483870968
8569528,1,B00BJC8KYQ,"This is the story about a woman that really really wants to be a mother.  The only problem is, she wants to be the biological mother of said child.  Then, when they decide to choose to adopt, of course she only wants a new fresh baby.  The social worker is my favorite character as she calls the woman out on her selfishness ""People don't normally just give away healthy brand new babies""  But all that aside, when they do find a birth mother that is willing to put her child up for adoption they are thrilled.  They receive a sonogram picture and make plans.
SPOILER ALERT the plans fall through and it's implied that the birth mother decided to abort instead.  Here's where I call bull. At that stage in the game (a sonogram was taken and the mother far enough along to know the baby's sex, as well as she was already in contact with the adoption agency) it is safe to assume the birth mother has made a decision, and it is for the baby's life.  The movie makes the unfortunate girl you barely get to see out to be some sort of monster when in reality, if such an adoption was going to happen and then didn't she either miscarried or there was something wrong and a D&C was necessary for her to not die.  The rest of the movie left me with an ill feeling in my stomach.",1495065600,,1271,4.223140495867769
8569529,4,B00BJC8KYQ,"I was very surprised at the ending, it made it realistic. The acting is not bad, but the pace is very slow. The slow pace is fitting for the story of agony and works. The message is not, follow God and your dreams will come true, its Follow God because of who He is and know that He is sufficient. It's one of the few Christian movies that does not walk a close line with prosperity Gospel. It also acknowledges that we will not always know the answer to why bad things happen, but that we can trust in God's sovereignty and know He is good, that does not change because we did not get what we wanted. I was very impressed.",1486771200,,623,4.114754098360656
