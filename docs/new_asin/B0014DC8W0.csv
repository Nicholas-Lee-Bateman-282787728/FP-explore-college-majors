8255307,5,B0014DC8W0,"I watch this DVD at least once a month, no lie.  envy is unquestionably one of my favorite bands - my second favorite of all time as a matter of fact.  Sheer brilliance in every note and every song.  As an envy fan you owe it to yourself to own this DVD.  The emotion is next level on this disc.  Phenomenal band, exceptional footage here.  Get a copy before it disappears for good.",1426723200,,382,4.164383561643835
8255308,5,B0014DC8W0,"I'm just going to say that I don't write many reviews, but after finishing this DVD, I had to write something good. I buy all sorts of band DVDs and some are excellent and some leave me with the feeling like I've been ripped off.

With the fact that there were no positive reviews about this DVD on Amazon, i had the feeling that this was going to be one of the rip off ones, but I was way off.

There was a lot of work put into this DVD and it's not like most, there are no interviews, no subtitles, just music, and video. Some of it is live clips of full songs (some are professionally shot and some are fan filmed), live clips of parts of songs, backstage stuff, some clips of the band videotaping each other, there are some music videos, and its all meshed into one 2 hour long feature, it all blends perfectly and keeps your interest throughout.

If you are even remotely close to being a fan of envy and you appreciate art, you will love this. I suggest you buy it.",1244073600,5,971,4.154255319148936
