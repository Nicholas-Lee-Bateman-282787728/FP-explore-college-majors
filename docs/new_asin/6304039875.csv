7860347,5,6304039875,"MARTIN THE COBBLER is a heartwarming video based on a short by Tolstoy. Martin is a lonely shoe maker who has completely shut out the world around him after the loss of his family. One day a priest asks Martin to repair a Bible for him. Martin does not believe he is worthy but agrees to do the job. When he goes to bed that evening, he has a dream that the Lord will visit him. The next day Martin has some visitors: a poor man who is shoveling snow, a poor woman with her child, and an old woman and young boy fighting with each other. In each situation, Martin is able to help the visitors. That night he reads the book and comes across the phrase Whenever you do it for one of my least, you do it for me. Martin realizes that the Lord did visit hymn that daythree times!
The story is uses Claymation characters which are lovable. We feel as if we are in pre-revolutionary Russia. The engineering is not the bets, but in a way it adds a certain flavor. I have watched this video many times and have used it with children as well. It never fails to please and tug at the heartstrings!",1071446400,28,1086,4.151658767772512

7860349,5,6304039875,"This is a beautiful rendition of Tolstoy's ""Where Love is"" into a visual medium. It picks up the flavor, the love, and the deep spirtual belief in the story perfectly. This would be a perfect gift for any Christian family.",998697600,7,222,4.575
7860350,5,6304039875,"This video scored high on several levels: As literature on video; as the finest in claymation; and for telling a truly spiritual and ""religious"" story in a non-sectarian manner.  This is as fine a family video as anyone could hope to own; a home video with a message that is timeless.  You may never get your children to read Tolstoy's books but I guarantee you that they'll never forget this story.  I have a friend whose children requested to re-watch this video until the tape wore out -- and they still quote lines from the story.  On the production-value side, this is one of the earliest works of claymation animator, Will Vinton (creator of the California raisins), and I think it's as good as anything he's done.",986083200,13,720,4.645669291338582
7860351,5,6304039875,"This is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful tales ever told; the story of an ordinary man and his return to faith and love. It's original title, by Tolstoy, is ""Where Love is, God Is"". A man living  without hope or love, has them restored to him by his own good deeds, and  learns the lesson: ""Whatsoever you do unto one of these, however small  he be, whatever you do to your brothers and sisters, remember you do unto  me."" A wonderful movie, in 'Claymation', for everyone.",943833600,25,480,4.420454545454546
