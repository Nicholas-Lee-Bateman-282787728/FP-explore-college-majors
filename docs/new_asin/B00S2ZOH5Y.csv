8697203,5,B00S2ZOH5Y,"As someone who has always been interested in permaculture, but never dared to create my own vegetable garden, I found Martins DVD exceptionally well organized, clearly explained, easy to follow, and full of specific and practical advice. Even a complete beginner city girl like me could start organic farming with this DVD  its a brilliant step-to-step, how-to manual for organic farming dummies and beyond.
  But thats not all. What fascinated me was to learn that even the marginal lands (most of the land in the southwest US where I would like to move) can be transformed into viable agricultural farms quickly, using the system of Instant Organic Farming (IOF) that Martin developed. Its exciting to think that your own poor soil backyard can be transformed into a productive garden in a very short time and with minimal investment! And you can use this system on a much larger scale as well  to reclaim poor land for farms. Ive read some organic farming books, which are excellent, but they don't address the problem of poor soil, which Martin does. Big difference.
Ultimately, I think that IOF has the potential to make significant contribution to food production, and Im thinking of Africa and the poor soil thats prevalent in most countries there. I've passed this DVD on to friends who have an NGO in Tanzania.",1427846400,,1319,4.901345291479821

8697207,5,B00S2ZOH5Y,"This is without a doubt the best approach to organic farming that I have seen on DVD and the ONLY one that addresses issues at a global level. The instructions are concise, the examples fit any area, and my sense is that one can indeed offset the rising costs of food AND enjoy eating your own home-grown veggies. I look forward to the Spring thaw!",1422230400,3,348,4.369230769230769
