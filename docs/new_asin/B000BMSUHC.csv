8089180,5,B000BMSUHC,"The packaging and cover titling are misleading and trite, but this is a treasure for those interested in European horses and dressage. There are two short films by single filmmaker, with similar deliberate, documentarian pacing, which would be a challenge to many used to the editing used in American commercial television. The feature on the school of Egon von Neindorff was exciting to discover after I had purchased his book on classical horsemanship, and despite a slow moving interview pace at the beginning, has footage of Lusitano, Kladruber and Lipizzaner horses in training and performance at the school. The feature on the long-running Swiss state circus was generally appealing in its treatment of the horses and an interesting behind the scenes look, would be interesting to anyone doing liberty training with their horse.",1448582400,,834,5.2781954887218046
8089181,1,B000BMSUHC,This is so boring. Bought it to watch the performances but it was entirely too boring.,1421539200,,86,4.4375
8089182,3,B000BMSUHC,I was disappointed in this DVD.It's not what I thought it would be about. It was totally different. If your into horses you might consider it.,1387756800,,142,4.5
8089183,2,B000BMSUHC,"In my opinion, this DVD was not marketed properly.  I expected more from this DVD based on the title and description.  Instead of being about horses of the WORLD, the DVD focused on horses in a particular Riding School and a particular Circus.  In my opinion, a lot is missing if this was truly intended to be about Horses of the World.",1308873600,,336,4.387096774193548
8089184,4,B000BMSUHC,"Though I enjoyed this far more than expected for a cheap DVD, I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the poor packaging: The cover has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the 2 documentaries on the DVD and the content has a very tenuous connection with the Spanish Riding School. This is very unfortunate, because the DVD contains 2 interesting German documentaries about Classical Dressage at German riding school and Free (at Liberty) Dressage in a Swiss circus.
The first movie is called ""The School for Horsemanship"" and was made in 1994. It is about Egon von Neindorff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Classical-Horsemanship/dp/3861279193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Classical Horsemanship</a>, and the riding school in Germany that he had taught at since the 1950's. He was a successful dressage competitor who quit the show ring to spend the rest of his life schooling horses and equestrians. His teachings are based on the same principles as the Spanish Riding School but at his school he has a variety of horse breeds, not just Lipizzaners.
The second is called ""Free Dressage"" and is about the Swiss Knie Circus. It shows 3 generations of the Knie family preparing their horses for the big top. They start each horse slowly and allow the public to see all their training sessions. Everything is about building trust between the horse and the trainer. I loved watching the training methods and how they don't rush the horse. I am not a fan of animals in circus-type performances but I would love to see their show live.",1268697600,2,1585,5.244094488188976
8089185,1,B000BMSUHC,"10 mins of viewing this DVD and It was Hanging and Jumping scenes there after. I returned to Amazon USA and was promptly replaced. The Replaced new DVD was fine till almost the end of 1st Episode, when the same problem persisted. This DVD is supposed to be region free. I have a region free DVD player with NTSC TV. I checked it out on my Laptop DVD Rom where the same problem persisted at the same point of time as in the Dvd Player. I did not bother to return the DVD second time. It has 2 episode/films on 1 DVD. The first is about dressage horse training and philosophy by the acclaimed Spanish riding school instructor(I apologize unable to pronounce his German name). He started his career with Horses in the stables, won titles in many competitions and now into Teaching students training Dressage Horses. He seems to love horses dearly. They show a few training clips from this Instructor and some shows by his Students. But it is certainly NOT any step by step training DVD for Dressage Horse if you are looking for one. The 2nd episode seems a circus setting with some nice acrobatics from Superbly trained Horses I guess it would have been a feast for the eyes if i was able to watch the remaining part in peace.",1259971200,,1223,4.44
8089186,1,B000BMSUHC,there should have been more info online re this dvd - as what we got was not what we expected,1247529600,,93,3.7
8089187,5,B000BMSUHC,"A joyful surprise. Did not expect this to be so loaded with ecquisit training and performance. It is actually 2 films on 1 DVD. The first will be appreciated by the lover of highest level dresage and training methods and philosophy by the higher acclaimed Spanish riding school typs instructor. The 2nd is not the circus we Americans know. It is a feast for the eyes with tastes above the rest, for equestrian high level training and bridleless work and animal combo horse feats that only can be properly trained by those who appreciate the unslaved spirit of the animal.
Definately worth more than the price!",1200614400,13,609,4.754716981132075
8089188,2,B000BMSUHC,"This video ended up being all about training horses, with a documentary (complete with subtitles) about the trainer.  I bought it for my daughter thinking it was about different horse breeds.",1174003200,9,191,5.161290322580645
