72,5,0005092663,"Every American should see this, especially if they are of the liberal persuasion! The only thing I would change is to have the words of the various quotes on the screen as they were being spoken. That would make a greater impact, and make it easier to pause the video and copy the quotes down.

The video may seem somewhat disjointed and not cover some of the events very deeply, but there is a reason for this. It is organized chronologically, rather than topically, which causes it to appear disjointed. As far as the depth of the coverage, if everything was covered in depth, it would have to be a 12-CD set! At least!

The video does a very good job of covering the highlights of what brought us from a godly nation to where we are today. Other than the David Barton videos, this is the best one I have seen on the topic so far.",1183507200,21,832,4.292993630573249

74,3,0005092663,"After reading other users' reviews and WND promotion, I was looking forward to an exciting, uplifting story about the U.S. With a few exceptions (ACLU and PP backgrounders), the presentation was tedious and the storyline disjointed. Example: a short segment on the Crusades; now let's talk about Christopher Columbus. Five minutes later you learn the connection. Now let's talk about something else! The quotations selected from our founding fathers are appropriate, but their vocabularly and writing style---while more advanced than most people's today---get in the way of the points being made.

Maybe it gets better towards the end. I started to fall asleep around 1920, so have not finished the DVD. Sorry. I wanted to like it but...",1161561600,7,737,5.245762711864407
75,5,0005092663,"This was an amazing DVD that I definitely recommend.  What I found interesting was the background and beginning of both, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU!  It actually turned my stomach a couple times.  Hopefully you enjoy it as well.",1154995200,22,233,4.923076923076923
76,5,0005092663,"I enjoyed the Gospel focused presentation of the history of our nation, but one section regarding the trial of a soldier for homosexuality is inappropriate for younger children. Also, later in the movie there are some clips of violence against a church by homosexual activists covered by news reports that would be too strong from young children.  Lastly, open displays of affection by homosexuals is covered by news reports at the end of the movie as well.  My advice is to view the movie yourself first and then determine what sections you can allow your children to view.  If you are not a Christian, you'll hate this movie.",1147996800,39,627,4.787037037037037

78,5,0005092663,"This documentay takes you on a journey...from Christopher Columbus to Jamestown...from Valley Forge to the Constitutional Convention...from the Civil War to the Industrial Revolution...from World War I to the Stock Market Crash...from FDR to the present. Our journey will give a basic grasp of God's sovereign hand behind the history of our nation, which our forefathers so clearly understood. The result of this journey will give us a better understanding of where America is today, how she arrived here, and where she must turn at this critical hour.

79,5,0005092663,"I grew up in Independence, Missouri the ""show me state"".  When I was in Junior high and we were studing about World War II and the atom bomb, from my history class I looked out the window to see Harry S. Truman walking to city hall to vote with a secrete serviceman by his side.  But I learned more American History from NATION ADRIFT than I did in high school and college.  Plus, I saw things that are rarely mentioned now, perhaps because we are all trying to be so politically correct that we left a few things out that really happened.  Seeing is believing.",984009600,9,561,4.314285714285714
80,5,0005092663,This is a real eye opener. You will feel outraged and saddened by what has slowly happened to this country. You will feel inspired to fight the good fight in order to not lose any more ground to the liberals in our country. You will get an insight to the US Court sytems and how their controversial decisions have slowly eroded our freedoms and challenge the very fabric that this great nation was founded upon.,977702400,13,411,4.493333333333333

96,5,0005092663,I had watched parts of this film before.  Man I'm glad I got to watch it all.  The historical background on Planned Parenthood and the ACLU is information everyone should have.  I will be recommending this to everyone.,1400198400,,218,4.684210526315789
97,2,0005092663,"While there was a lot of information in this piece (some of it coming at your faster than a freight train, another down side of the video), there is no doubt that it was produced as right-wing propaganda, which means I'm not able to use it as I hoped (for my children's home schooling). One large section of the video is a series of quotes from historical U. S. leaders, mentioning God and/or the Bible -- the quotes are simply inserted without any background or even a common-ground to relate each of them.",1398988800,2,507,4.462365591397849

99,5,0005092663,"There is an essential message here that is not being told in society today.  People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.

The other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.

We HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.  This DVD would be beneficial for viewing in every home, school, and church in this country.",1388707200,,1497,5.056910569105691

101,4,0005092663,"Haters will say this is biased, that the founding fathers were not christians, or that they were deists...and maybe that's true for some of the ff.

103,4,0005092663,"This video presents a very good capsular History of our country and its founding principles.  It the progresses on through the history of america and how the fabric of what once made her an unusual nation began to deteriorate.  America was founded through a war that broke the shackles of a tyrant King George and on the basis of religious freedom. Many were still not free and so a second war would ensue .  Family, Faith, personal responsibility, generosity, work, morality, integrity and freedom are all part of that legacy.  Oven the decades those have been eroded.

105,5,0005092663,"Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.

109,5,0005092663,A Nation Adrift is a must see documentary.  It tells you what your history books didn't or tells your children what they don't hear in school.

Statements about the Christian foundation of the United States are emphasized, but there is hardly anything about the stain of slavery on our nation. Margaret Sanger is attacked for beliefs she later moderated. Guess what, Abe Lincoln was originally for returning slaves to Liberia. By the end of his life he felt the Civil War was American's punishment for slavery. Anything communist or socialist is also attacked in the video. The history of America and its people is very complex, it is still being written and still being evaluated. Don't let this video fool you.",1523059200,,665,5.0
