2814891,5,B000PAU2Z8,"I am 70. I row a scull.  My muscles are naturally very tight. I used the Basic (first DVD) a few times several years ago.  (I presume that equates to ""Volume 1."") It helped loosen me up, but some of the rotating exercises were very ""stretching"" and to say the least, they were uncomfortable - even painful; so I stopped using the DVD. About a month ago I got tired of taking ""forever"" to get off the floor after brushing my dog and my inability to turn and look behind me while rowing.  I decided to give the exercises another shot.  That was the best decision I could have made.

 I've followed the DVD 2-3 times per week for the last month and have gotten so that 2 of the 3 rotating stretching exercises are actually very comfortable.  The third rotating exercise has more range of motion than when I started, but I'm not to the point that the instructor says I will get.  Yes, it has made a nice difference in getting up off the floor and turning to look behind me while rowing.  8^)  Regarding viewing my TV, I lie parallel to the face of the TV with my chest pointed at the screen.  I have no problem viewing it, and I appreciate the instructor's reminders regarding positioning.  I keep my remote near me so that I can fast forward through sections of explanation I no longer need. I can complete the exercises in about 40 minutes that way.
I do feel better, have much better ability to look back behind me in sports and driving, and I agree with the one reviewer who stated that he or she walks taller.  I feel good.  I will stay on the Basic DVD for now.  If I switch to the Advanced DVD, I'll review it later. I recommend using the Basic set of exercises 3 times per week.",1360022400,15,1682,4.245283018867925
2814892,3,B000PAU2Z8,"I found that it was difficult to see the TV and maintain the correct posture at times. This exercises must be done with caution, back may get worse with the wrong movements.  It is good to do it along with someone else.",1348876800,4,219,4.214285714285714
2814893,4,B000PAU2Z8,"This video is helpful, but I was disappointed that it did not have all of the same exercises as the book had.  It does have some of them though, and watching them helps me to understand how to do them better.",1209513600,13,208,4.073170731707317
2814894,4,B000PAU2Z8,"This is not your normal workout video! It can fix what ails you. Pros: if you can spend 45 minutes to do the exercises regularly you should soon feel stronger and more relaxed in your shoulders, back, hips, feet, etc. You'll walk taller and pains will disappear. Five stars for the exercises and how they make you feel. Cons: until you learn the exercises, you will have to listen to the overly technical soundtrack. I don't need to know the names of all my muscles, I just need instructions! Deduct one star for that, but there is an option to follow without the soundtrack, too. Verdict: this is a great and inexpensive way to see what the Egoscue Method can do for you.",1199145600,34,672,4.471544715447155

2814896,5,B000PAU2Z8,"I have been working out most of my life. I am 59 and use a wide variety of excersies. Most of my issues are from improper moves or mistakes from the past. I am also a well seasoned personal trainer. I purchased ""Volume 1 for beginners"" as well as ""Pain Free"" for help with misalignment and structural issues that have created pain and discomfort for the past 3 years or so. I noticed relief from the first routine with ""Pain Free."" ""  Volume 1"" has taken me further in my quest for re-allignment and pain reduction. I would say my pain has decreased by 75% and my misalligned hips are straightened out by 90% I LOVE THIS STUFF! I'm moving into Vol 2 soon. I would agree with everything that dr beth said though. If you don't know how to lessen the psoas discomfort on the crunches you may try doing just 10 or 15. Personally I don't get into 100 crunches... just me though. There are many more core excersises to focus on. But great for the natural curve of the spine. Love it. I'm all in with Egoscue, and I plan on spending the winter focusing on this while backing off of my regular routine. Time to reassess...again. I keep backing off, year by year. Smarter not harder I guess.",1418688000,7,1182,4.324324324324325

2814898,4,B000PAU2Z8,"I recently picked up both volumes of the Egoscue Pain-Free series at a used book sale, including this one and the second,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Egoscue-Pain-Free-Workout-Series-Vol-2/dp/B000PAU2ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Egoscue: Pain Free Workout Series, Vol. 2</a>.  This first volume is labelled as ""Beginners,"" which is meant to include those who do not exercise on a regular basis.  Although I actually work out daily and consider myself to be at a high intermediate level, I started with this DVD prior to Volume 2, as I was curious about the Egoscue method.

The routine on this DVD is instructed by Brian Bradley, the Egoscue VP of Therapy Protocol.  Brian does not perform the exercises himself; rather, he leads Liba Placek, the Egoscue Director of Athletics (and the instructor for Volume 2) through the movements.  The Main Menu offers several options.  First, there is a Functional Test, in which Brian instructs you to try to touch you palms to the floor and then repeat after completing the routine.  Next, there is the Complete Workout (45 minutes) with Brian and Liba.  There is also a second workout option, Workout with Music Only, in which both Brian's and Liba's voices are muted--instead, the names of the exercises appear on screen, and an audio cue (a bell flourish) sounds when it is time to change exercises. I found this odd and awkward, especially with the loud, revival-like guitar music playing in the background.  The Menu also includes a resources section.

Brian and Liba are featured in a plain studio. A timer is used for the exercises which require a hold. I have listed all of the exercises below, sometimes offering brief descriptions.

1.  Lying Hip Abduction/Adduction, 20 reps
2.  Foot Circles plus Point/Flexes, 10 reps in/out, 20 reps point/flex
3.  Lying Lateral Leg Raises, 10 reps each directions (up/down)
4.  Frog (lying), hold 1 minute
5.  Hip Crossover Stretch, held 1 minute per side
6.  Cats and Dogs (aka cat/cow), 10 reps
7.  Opposite Hand-Leg Lifts, hands & knees, 5 reps per side (held 5 secs each)
8.  Upper Spinal Twist (lying), held 1 minute per side
9.  Pelvic Tilts, 10 reps
10. Free Crunches with Obliques, 25 reps, 2 sets
11. Active Bridges, 15 reps
12. Free Crunches, 25 reps, 2 sets
13. Static Extension (on elbows), hold 1 minute
14. Kneeling Groin Stretch, hold 1 minute per side
15. Seated Femur Rotations, 10 reps, 3 sets (wider each set)
16. Modified IT Band Stretch (lying, bottom leg straight), held 1 minute per side
17. Cats and Dogs (aka cat/cow), 10 reps
18. Free Squat, hold 1 minute

Overall, I thought that this routine included some nice exercises that stretched the lower back/hips in particular, including the Cats/Dogs, Spinal Twist, Pelvic Tilts, Bridges, and IT Band Stretch.  However, I question the inclusion of some of the exercises.  For example, crunches, especially as performed here, can be not only challenging but also rough on various parts of the body, including the back and next--not something I would except in a ""beginners"" workout.  Being an experienced exerciser, I knew how to modify these moves for myself, but no modifications are shown during this routine.

In summary, I would recommend this DVD with caution, especially for true beginners.",1414886400,8,3303,5.128971962616823
2814899,5,B000PAU2Z8,"This DVD will change your life and remove lifelong pain issues by just showing how to stand correctly! More than that the exercises feel great! I am not into exercise but this DVD is the one I would recommend to everyone.  In the kitchen, washing dishes etc. I remember to place more weight on my right foot. This aligns my whole body and I am on my way to eliminate decades of misalignment. Suddenly I can breath better and I am correcting pressures that once led to sciatica pain etc. This is the one exercise DVD that is geared for anybody and the most worthwhile for correcting structural issues that will guarantee a much better encounter with old age!",1404864000,2,657,4.5210084033613445

8190132,2,B000PAU2Z8,"After reading the reviews on this DVD, I was encouraged to give it a try.  However, I had to send it back.  I have Neural Foraminal Stenosis (a pinched nerve in my lumbar spine), with some arthritis.  The first thing you'll notice when you start the video is that the exercises are done on a mat on the floor.  Getting down on the floor and back up again is very difficult for me.  The leader says, ""these exercises can be done anywhere"".  Well, yes, and no.  You can probably do them on your bed, but I don't think you'll get the full benefit from it.  So, I'll summarize by stating that if you can't get down on the floor, you probably need to think twice about purchasing this DVD.  Better to consider DVD's that offer workouts while sitting in a chair, or standing while holding on to the back of a chair for balance.",1498262400,2,821,4.279220779220779

I am now playing my cello, and this was impossible for a few years. I can twist perfectly for my golf swing (I am a beginner) and golf is not hurting my back at all. There was a time I thought I would never be able to play cello nor every learn to play golf because of my back,SI joints, and sciatica. This volume one also helped me cure the partial rotator cuff tear I got a couple years ago. I also has given me the posture of a teenager again! Highly recommended by me and many athletes.
