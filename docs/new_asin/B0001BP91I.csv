8009768,4,B0001BP91I,"This video dealt well with a difficult topic, sexual abuse of children, in an informative, balanced manner.  The impact of sexual abuse on the primary victim was shown from various perspectives: male,female, juvenile, and adult.  All of the victims were abused by people known to them and their families, rather than strangers. This video could be used in sex offender treatment to deal with victim empathy, or it could be used in a chaperone group.",1200614400,,449,4.973333333333334
8009769,5,B0001BP91I,"This video is a powerful documentary of the aftermath of sexual abuse of different young people.  The courage of these individuals and families in sharing their stories is admirable.  This is a candid and often disturbing look at the horrors that victims of sexual abuse experience, and drives home the fact that once abused, their lives are forever altered no matter how much therapy and support they may receive.  The stories are woven together artfully.  There are segments where sexual offenders acknowledge the damage they have done and share a small glipse into the disturbed and deviant thinking that they use in order to inflict this kind of damage upon the most vulnerable part of society, our children.  This video has a lot to offer survivors as well as educates the general public. It skillfully brings home the fact that sexual abuse happens in all parts of American Society.  It also has a place in treatment settings for perpetrators to truly witness the devestation of their crimes.",1087516800,3,998,4.946107784431137
