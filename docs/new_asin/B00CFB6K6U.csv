5720985,4,B00CFB6K6U,"What I liked about this dvd, is that its to the point and basic!

For the price I cannot complain, picked up a few techniques to offer students when presenting various courses",1395964800,,175,4.46875
5720986,5,B00CFB6K6U,"Kyle Lamb's training DVDs are superb.  You really don't need to say anything else.  I have both tapes as well as the AR15 tapes.  Great stuff.  This one is a bit different, focusing on fighting techniques in various scenarios.",1392854400,,226,4.717948717948718
5720987,4,B00CFB6K6U,"This is a one-of-a-kind video on vehicle shooting tactics, including some great (and high-quality) slow-motion shots of ballistics through different kinds of glass.  Barricaded shooting, interior shooting, under-the-chassis shooting: plenty of great information with well thought out, practical use-cases.  I would definitely recommend this video to anyone carrying in a car, but especially patrol officers.  I didn't give it five stars, though, as it goes off-track into wounded shooter drills that have nothing to do with vehicles, it focuses too much on carbines versus pistols, and it doesn't touch on the most-asked questions about vehicles: how practical are car doors for cover? (since that's a standard police doctrine).  I recommend it, but I certainly want more.",1384732800,19,772,5.629310344827586
5720988,5,B00CFB6K6U,Great video. Very informative on different shooting positions to utilize. I will definitely be implementing this into my off duty training.,1380672000,3,139,5.666666666666667
8581196,4,B00CFB6K6U,"Ive watch a few videos now on vehicular tactics and I must say this video is by far the one I enjoyed the most. 4/5 stars because at times the wind drowned out audio instruction and I wished this video had a bit more content. However, I enjoyed how the video was set up. As opposed to other videos that can play from a lengthly beginning to end, this video has topics that are short and to the point. Kyles first explainations are on weapon placement and dealing with bringing a weapon on target and dealing with the seatbelt. Other videos don't even cover this topic!  As for the arguement to show why to keep tight in cover, Kyles video shows you why you should from camera angles: Youll immediately see why you should keep tight. This video has presentations that are short, simple and to the point and very practible. Theres no magic or woo shoo to combat. You won't forget these lessons.",1524009600,,892,4.439024390243903
8581197,5,B00CFB6K6U,"DVD covers the basics on fighting around, in and out of vehicles. Audio visual production quality is adequate no frills approach.
Information on subject matter is impeccable - tough one might want to explore the subject deeper out side this DVD.
More experienced armchair commandos will Street fighter DVD an excellent reference material for their training, others get great intro on vehicle tactics.",1522886400,,400,5.365079365079365
8581198,5,B00CFB6K6U,Good clear instructions from a very knowledgable guy very practical advice,1491436800,,74,5.818181818181818
8581199,5,B00CFB6K6U,"Excellent advanced instruction and drills, mostly on shooting from and around vehicles, and malfunctions,
This is better suited for police officers and soldiers in urban environments, although everyday citizens can benefit from this.
Highly recommended!

I simultaneously purchased 5.11 Pistol Training 1.5 with SGM Kyle Lamb, the same instructor. This is also excellent intermediate/advanced  instruction and drills on shooting on the move, malfunctions, and barricade positions..",1468800000,3,481,6.2727272727272725
8581200,4,B00CFB6K6U,"Good material, but fairly short video.",1459036800,,38,5.5
8581201,5,B00CFB6K6U,This has answered so many questions i have had regarding how i carry/ employ a pistol as a CHP holder. For me this DVD was a total paradigm shift as far as how the pistol and carbine is used in and around vehicles. SGM Lambs teaching style is engaging and very informative. All around an outstanding DVD.,1456012800,5,304,4.350877192982456
8581202,4,B00CFB6K6U,Wonderful tips. Really helped out,1454284800,,33,5.8
8581203,3,B00CFB6K6U,"I was hoping for a lot more than this dvd offered.  Overall it showed a couple of unique shooting positions (the one on the cover was, oddly enough,  NOT one of them).  The presentation was ok.  More-or-less it looked like someone who was just out having fun showing a couple of drills.  He mentioned how the ""in-car"" drills would be different with a tactical load-out, but he never once ran a drill in gear.  I guess I should have gone with Magpul's Art of the Dynamic Carbine/Pistol for something a little more practical.",1445644800,7,523,4.56989247311828
8581204,5,B00CFB6K6U,Excellent reference.,1436140800,,20,9.5
8581205,5,B00CFB6K6U,"Awesome DVD. Perfect for the Soldier, Sailor or Marine or Airman who wants to up his knowledge of his rifle and pistol skills. The DVD is all about applying carbine and pistol skills to the gunfight.",1430006400,2,199,4.555555555555555
