4285349,1,B0047S4UPW,"I'm a huge fan of the Dead Space series. I own every bit of Dead Space related media released to date, including the games, comics, movies, and novel. This movie is Dead Space for people who hate everything that is Dead Space. Within the first five minutes of the movie, I was able to identify the true, horrible nature of the Necromorphs: they weren't the re-animated corpses-turned-alien-killing-machines of all established canon. No, the truth was much more sinister than that: In Aftermath, they were manifestations of the Evil Spirit of 1992, come from the grave to take its terrible animation back.

What Aftermath tries to pull off is a very Rashemon-inspired ""same story from different perspectives"" effect, by having four different survivors interrogated about the same series of events leading up to the present. Many movies have pulled this trick, but even the late TV show Mama's Family accomplished it better in a single campy 30-minute episode than this travesty of modern animation.

In Aftermath, the story is told through four separate flashback-style animation segments, each done by different animators. These segments are interconnected by a present-day story, which looks to be of lower quality than the cutting-room-floor discards of Final Fantasy 7 cutscenes. Even the computer scenes from Hackers are of better quality than this offal. The flashback sequences are... acceptable, and in some cases even rather decent. But none of it holds a candle to the previous movie, Downfall (and even that wasn't super-stellar, truth be told).

The story also makes no sense. The forced interrogations make no sense. The space physics make no sense. The airlock scene makes no sense. The entire final battle makes no sense. None of it makes any bloody sense. The only redeeming quality is the voice acting, which was for the most part pretty solid. But even that one ray of goodness is marred by the atrocious script. I got the feeling that the whole thing was written by someone who was shown one or two pieces of concept art and then told to write their own story about it.

If you are a fan of the Dead Space series, and want to keep your memories of the franchise enjoyable, please, for the love of Altman and all he ""sacrificed,"" avoid Aftermath like the vomitous necromorph bile that it is. That was 85 minutes of my life that would have been better spent in the video game.",1295827200,14,2392,4.898765432098766

4285357,4,B0047S4UPW,"*Just to be clear, I have never played the games in my life*

After being a little disappointed in the previous film, I wasn't sure how this one would play out. However, much to my surprise, I thought this movie was much better than Dead Space: Downfall. Where Dead Space: Downfall felt like a re-hash of so many sci-fi/monster movies with nothing really unique going for it, Aftermath brings up a few stories-within-a-story, where we not only get a look at the same event from numerous point of views, but there's actually some character development along the way as well.

The character of Kuttner is the stand out star imo. His story is far from original, but still incredibly touching. His ending is creepy as well.
Then there's the character only known as The Lead Interrogator , who's as scary as any creatures to be found in the movie. Also, the design of the ship and the room where the survivors are interrogated was brilliant.

Despite the mixed animation that some don't care for, Dead Space: Aftermath is a well-written story. It's easy to follow, has fleshed-out characters, and really went above and beyond my meager expectations. If there were a third movie in the series, no doubt I'd watch it.",1433548800,,1210,4.725118483412322

4285377,2,B0047S4UPW,"I was thoroughly upset with how this movie came out, especially when compared to the first movie. Without giving away and plot points the movie seems to focus on character interaction more so then horror or action. I found my self constantly being distracted by items that seemed to change within the movie.

I found it very distracting that each survivor gets their own art style. I give the movie props for breaking out of the ordinary but it just goes to the extreme. The Ex marine's daughter was white in some scenes then in others she appears as African American. The same can be said with the female Doctor who appears to change race as well. Don't get me started at the Male Doctor's final appearance which was just outrageous. I appreciate the risk, but this should have been shelved.

The next point I have it the lack of horror/action. The games started out as being atmosphere heavy with a side of action. When the second one was created it seemed to be about 50/50. However you won't see any Necromorph action until about 45 minuets into the movie. This was way to much, as I had no feelings toward any of the main characters. Lived or died, I had no connection for them.

If you are not a Dead Space fan, I would give it 1/5. There is nothing for you to gain of this. If you are a dead Space fan I would still rate it a poor 2/5. The lack of action/caring characters and confusing character appearance changes can't hold your attention for the full length. I hoped there would be some Gem in this, but there isn't any. I understand that the creators have to follow the game's rules, but I read the two dead space books and found them way more entertaining then this film.",1369699200,3,1684,4.408360128617363

4285381,2,B0047S4UPW,"Dead Space: Aftermath (Mike Disa, 2011)

As of yesterday morning, I had fifteen movies on my Netflix queue rated less than two stars. I have since watched four of them, and have only agreed with one (Hellraiser: Revelations). I liked, give or take, the first animated Dead Space movie, and I liked, give or take, Afermath (current Netflix rating, according to my instant-streaming page: 1.9), which covers the events between the first and second games. Understand that liked is a term I'm using loosely here. Animated movies have to be judged on a different set of criteria than live-action movies do. You have to expect overacting from the voice characters, you obviously don't have to worry about cinematography, lighting, etc., and the most important guy behind the camera isn't the director, it's the lead animator. In this case, I can't quite be sure who that is; the credits list key animation directors, but only for two of the sequences (there are five, four flashbacks and a wraparound). For what it's worth, the two listed are Jung-eun Kim (Millennium Actress) and Eun-kyung Kwon (in is feature debut). Is it these guys I should be yelling at? I got no clue.

SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't played the games, the plot summary contains major spoilers for the film (I assume most people interested in watching the movie will be fans of the game, so I'm not terribly concerned about spoilers). If you have not yet (a) seen Aftermath and/or (b) played Dead Space 2, which by default gives away the end of the movie, skip the next paragraph.

Plot: Aftermath takes us through the events that get Nolan Stross (voice of Ghost Game's Curt Cornelius, who also voices Nolan Stross in Dead Space 2) into captivity next to Isaac Clarke, protagonist of the original Dead Space, in The Sprawl. As we open, a rescue team is boarding the O'Bannon to look for survivors. They find four: Stross, Isabel Cho (voice of Heathens and Thieves' Gwendoline Yeo), Alejandro Borges (voice of Piranha 3D's Ricardo Chavira), and Nickolas Kuttner (voice of The Dark Knight Rises' Christopher Judge). Two scientists, an engineer, and a security officer. They are taken back to The Sprawl and questioned, one by one, about what happened on the O'Bannon; the story each tells fills in another piece of the puzzle of what happened on the O'Bannon (and on Aegis VII's mining colony).

Ultimately, there are two main problems with Aftermath. The first is... we don't see a necromorph until forty-five minutes into the movie? What? Granted, that's probably only going to be a problem for the gamers, but then like I said, I assume most everyone watching this will be familiar with the games. The second is the animation. It's okay for a computer game, but... well, let me put it this way: we've had some movies over the past decade or so with great animation, but ridiculous stories, when the stories even exist (Final Fantasy and Immortel: Ad Vitam come to mind immediately). Here we have the opposite problem. You combine that animation with these compelling stories and you're going to get a movie that will wow people pretty hard. (Assuming you add some necromorphs earlier on, that is....) As it is, though, I think this is only applicable to hardcore Dead Space gamers, and even a bunch of those are going to be disappointed in this. **",1362009600,,3315,4.820738137082601
4285382,2,B0047S4UPW,"I won't get too far into this video, there are plenty of reviews already for it but I would like to go on the record by stating just one thing.  If your not a die hard Dead Space fan, leave this one alone.  As for the people giving it a five star rating I can only assume they must be fanboys/fangals of the series to have overlooked simple details.  Just as one prime example in one of the story tracks a man of the African-American persuasion is grieving over the tragic loss of his daughter, who is represented as an Asian girl for roughly 90% of his story who is then transformed into an African-American girl.  Its small details like this that offset the viewing enjoyment, and its not the only one.  But overlooking magical racial flips this is a filler with no direct story content to the games or any of the lore other than the Marker and its effects really.

This animated full-length feature is full of blood, guts and suspense, just as you would expect from all things DS.

The story picks up where the video game Dead Space 2 leaves off. On Aegis VII, a scouting team from the O'Bannon is dispatched to recover pieces of the Marker, and everything falls apart beginning with the very first exposure.

We finally see how planet crackers (like the USG Ishimura) actually excavate continent-sized pieces of planets, during the mining process.

4285391,3,B0047S4UPW,"I've played the dead space titles, seen the movies and read some of the books since the original motion comics were available leading up to the game's release.

Dead Space: Aftermath is the worst experience I've had in the series so far. Aftermath is supposed to bridge the gap between 1 and 2 just like Downfall did between the comics and first game. I expected this to be a supplemental tale instead of something that could really stand on its own. I was correct. Just like in my review of Downfall, if you're not a fan of the game series, don't give this a second glance. There's far too much back story for this to be enjoyable on its own.

**SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST GAME FOLLOW**
What you have here is a story built on flashbacks. A space crew on a special mission to stabilize Aegis 7 and recover bits of the marker left from when Isaac destroyed it at the end of the first game run into some unfortunate occurrences when one of the pieces is found. The survivors are interrogated, one by one, by government officials to identify what went on. In true survival-horror fashion, things don't go as planned and gory hijinx ensue.

The interesting aspect to this movie is that the overarching story and each flashback story feature a different animation team. This is where it gets dicey. I'll be honest, the overarching story is created with cel-shaded 3d animation... and it's awful. Remember the 3D animated cartoon Re-Boot? Yeah, it's that bad. It's so bad that you just kind of want to skip through it between flashbacks. Had the entire movie been done in this style, I would be writing a one star review. The flashbacks are all very well done however. Animating styles are varied, but overall done skillfully. The only real complaint is that because they were done completely independently of each other, every character looks different in each flashback. It's pretty easy to get your bearings at the beginning of each one and figure out who is who, but I think a general conceptual consensus between teams would have made it better. Voice acting is well done and the overall audio track is good.

Overall it's a decent story, because it's being told through flashbacks you get a lot of overlapping which, on one hand is interesting seeing the different perspectives, but on the other you're watching the same thing multiple times. I wouldn't say they overlap excessively though, there's enough new material in each flashback that it isn't just a retelling of the same story 4 times. Ultimately, in terms of story, this is a footnote or possibly and epilogue to the first game. It's far from necessary and really it's just giving you a flashy tale to get Isaac from his escape pod to the Sprawl. I recommend a rental or netflix viewing before you commit to a purchase.",1354406400,,2776,4.670756646216769
4285392,3,B0047S4UPW,"The cover fools me into thinking it was as good as the first one. Though it got my attention, overall it was ok. I would still watch it again, but the animation sucked like Transformers: Beast Wars type of thing. The story line was just through 4 people's different points of view on what occurred after arriving on the contaminated ship. Would I recommend it? Meh, maybe you are better off getting Dead Space: Downfall than this one honestly.",1353283200,,443,4.620253164556962
4285393,5,B0047S4UPW,This was a really really good movie that will keep you rooting in your place as you watch. The plots and prose are sophisticated and the action is realistic. Actors are not spared the repercussions of catastrophic events simply because of the importance of their personas outside of the movie.,1342310400,,293,4.88

So if you're looking for a great suspenseful film that covers some history on the Deadspace universe as well as it covering one of the characters featured in Deadspace 2 then you won't be disappointed.

So I hope they keep this tradition going and give us another animated film to accompany the next Deadspace game releasing next year. These Direct to video prequels fit in the DS universe like glove so keep up the good work Visceral games/EA!",1341964800,,719,4.565891472868217
4285395,2,B0047S4UPW,"The television industry recently underwent a subtle change in how it releases television series on DVD.  With the advent of DVD collections and Netflix's Instant Queue, it's possible to watch an entire series of television episodes back-to-back. This makes inconsistencies between episodes much more glaring than they were decades ago. If ""Dead Space: Aftermath"" is any indication, the video game industry has yet to learn this lesson.

""Aftermath"" takes place after the events of ""Dead Space: Downfall"" and the original Dead Space game. The USG O'Bannon has been sent to investigate what happened to the Ishimura and the planet it was mining, Aegis VII. When the O'Bannon loses contact with the Concordance Extraction Corporation, they send the Marine battleship Abraxis to investigate.  What the marines discover from the remaining four survivors creates a series of loosely-connected stories as each of them, under duress, shares an animated tale of horror.

There's security officer Nicholas Kuttner (Christopher Judge), engineer Alejandro Borgas (Ricardo Chavira), chief science officer Nolan Stross (Curt Cornelius), and chief medical officer Isabella Cho (Gwendoline Yeo).  They are tortured by an Interrogator (Peter Woodward) who uses technology to terrorize the subjects with their darkest fears in order to get them to talk.  Of course, there's really no indication that they wouldn't want to talk except perhaps that two of them are insane - the Interrogator tortures them just to ""soften them up."" Since these tortures are cell-shaded CGI, they look more ridiculous than terrifying.

Kuttner's daughter, who died in an accident prior to the incident on Aegis VII, reveals that he was part of a secret mission to retrieve pieces of the infamous Red Marker from the first film.  Harassed by visions of his dead daughter that we can only assume is due to the Marker, he promptly goes violently bonkers.  It doesn't end well for Kuttner or the Marines who try to restrain him.

Borgas, sporting a cybernetic arm, is the only crew member not in on the conspiracy, so his value to the Interrogator is limited.  There doesn't seem to be any reason for him to have a cybernetic arm either - it doesn't affect the plot significantly - but does serve as reminder that although there are cybernetics in 2500 AD, there's still no cure for baldness or near-sightedness (several of the characters wear glasses).

This lack of attention to detail becomes increasingly glaring with each flashback.  Different animation styles change the look and feel of the characters, varying the hair length, physical fitness, cup size and even ethnicity of the characters.  It feels like the various artists developed their projects independently of one another.

The character development is wildly inconsistent too.  Cho, who comes across as cold and aloof, has an affair with Stross in a medical lab, an unforgivable gaffe for any doctor we're expected to take seriously. Stross is the only interesting character, whom the Marker uses as a vessel to communicate a chemical formula that, in mad scientist fashion, he immediately concocts in his lab.

Then the necromorphs show up.  ""Downfall"" made it clear that the Markers were a cork of sorts preventing the necromorphs from escaping and infecting corpses.  ""Aftermath"" throws all that out the window and decides that necromorphs are spontaneously created by the Marker.

There are no heroes in this film and not much of a plot to hang onto.  It's more like an animated version of ""Tales from the Darkside,"" only less coherent and with cheap animation. Watch in isolation, it's passable if somewhat derivative horror entertainment; as an installment that shows up in your Netflix queue right after ""Downfall"" it's just an inchoate mess.",1340323200,2,3774,5.194719471947194

The movie's plot is hard to follow because you don't really know who to root for. None of the characters are particularly likable. You get the general idea of who's a good or bad, but you're never given a reason to care about any of them.

The monsters are cool, but I'm sure they can be found in the video game. I don't know if the video game is more fun than the movie, but I'd be shocked if it wasn't.

Maybe it's because I'm too old or maybe it's because I'm not into Dead Space, but I hated this movie. It's a waste of time for any member of the human race. I don't say this very often, but I want the time I wasted watching this film back.",1328140800,,971,4.181818181818182

First, this is anime, with all the traditional Japanese stylings, including the bare-breasted, well-endowed very young girl, who is also a leading scientist. They sprinkle plenty of profanity throughout the movie to make sure it earns its R rating. What should get it the R rating however, are the scenes of graphic physical and mental torture and murder inflicted on the members of the crew by their superiors. I guess we're supposed to identify more with them, but it just turns me off.

The animation quality is about on par with the violent Saturday morning cartoons. After watching the game trailers at the beginning, I was hoping to see a full-length movie of that quality, but alas, the video games are far superior graphically.

The storyline was coherent enough, but it leaves you hanging, as if there will be a follow-on. It wasn't interesting enough to overcome my distaste of the style or the gratuitous torture to want to either a sequel or prequel of any kind.",1319673600,,1122,4.685279187817259

Between each character's telling, you're treated to CGI bridge sequences that might have been animated in the 90's.  The constant change in style does add some interest, and while none of the styles is anything remotely new, the added texture in the film distracts from some of its shortcomings.

With that being said, I must say that the animation (effects) are fairly low quality and not particularly impressive.  The story line may make more sense for anyone who is familiar with the game.  I was not shaken up by it.

4285408,2,B0047S4UPW,"I feel I should declare upfront I am not an avid video game player.  In my younger years I was a passionate Atari, Colovision and old school Nintendo video game player. In modern times I have slowly drifted away from indulging in the escapism that is and was playing video games.  Therefore my review of this movie based off a video game might not be justifiable by the gaming community.

This film serves as a conduit between the games ""Dead Space"" and ""Dead Space 2"".  I haven't played either game, but from my understanding they mirror the ""Resident Evil"" series, which I do like.  In addition, these games have some positive critical acclaim.  I should take this opportunity to state this movie is a CGI/animation film.

The movie starts out with space marines discovering four survivors on a spaceship that the former were sent to investigate.  After the survivors are taken aboard another spacecraft they are interrogated about what happened on the spaceship and why they were the only survivors. The accounts of each survivor allow the movie to be broken down into four vignettes. The conduit between all four vignettes is this ""alien artifact"" that induces mind control and can turn dead people into creatures.

There isn't much more to the movie.  Each vignette features a different director and animation style.  I found the change of animation for each story very distracting.  At times I felt like I was playing/watching a video game.  In addition, most of the characters were wearing helmets for a good portion of the movie.  This made it difficult for me to know who was or wasn't speaking. The character development was also a bit lacking. As for the story itself, it was lazy, unoriginal and dare I say predictable, when there weren't loopholes in continuity.  Perhaps I need to play the games to appreciate this movie.  As a stand alone movie, I really didn't think it was that wonderful.",1300752000,3,1905,4.815384615384615
4285409,2,B0047S4UPW,"Dead Space: Aftermath is the follow up to Deep Space and based on the video game of the same name. The USG O'Bannon has been sent to Aegis VII on a mission to find pieces of an alien artifact.  Only four members of the crew make it down to the volcanic surface.  The animation is kind of cheesy when compared to all of the CGI we see in today's movies.  The movie follows the four survivors individually and we get a 'Rhoshamon' type of story told by each person.

When they find the 'artifact' it seems to have a hallucinatory effect on humans and turns dead people into a type of zombie. People who play the video game will enjoy this, but for the rest of us the seesawing between three dimensional present and two-d dreams flashbacks.  For me this was just a waste of my time not understanding the back story and not caring about the front story, and the violence is pretty lame and doesn't add anything except to the gore level.

With all the advances in computer generated graphics, this offering is a bit of a disappointment. The only really interesting aspect of this film is that as each character is retelling the events on the dangerous planet; each ""story"" is shown from a different perspective.
Two distinct animation styles are actually used. As each survivor is interrogated, 3D style is used. Each survivor's flashback is in the old 2D style. The characters don't even look similar between the two styles.
Also, there does not appear to be any continuity from the first film (Dead Space Downfall) and this one (Dead Space Aftermath.) The only commonality is the planet and the artifact.

4285412,1,B0047S4UPW,"This isn't the first videogame-anime marriage. I've seen the first Dead Space anime, the Halo anime, and the Dante's Inferno anime. This is the worst. The anime stories (obviously made by different animators, given drastically different character models), are tied together with a CGI story with CGI so terrible it's actually laughable. The graphics from the video game look better than the bland and stiff CGI characters/settings.

I don't understand why the studio decided not to follow the main protagonist from the Dead Space games (which, by the way, are excellent). It really seems like a lost opportunity.

The story is pretty generic and bland: a recovery crew comes into contact with a shard from an alien artifact, it makes him crazy, it makes everyone crazy it comes near - then it creates the necromorphs (read: space zombies). So the crew has to destroy the shard to destroy the infection. Then shadowy government operatives want to cover-up the events and try to use the artifact's power. There's little explanation of who the operatives are, or why their methods are so hardcore, or how anyone would believe the ridiculous cover-up story. Honestly, if it wasn't for the language and gratuitous nudity, I'd think someone wrote this script for a children's Saturday morning cartoon - it's that bland and full of plot holes.

As a big fan of the games, I found this anime a real let down. Don't waste your money. Don't even rent it and waste your time.",1299715200,6,1464,4.895161290322581
4285413,4,B0047S4UPW,"Well I finally decided to bite the bullet and order Dead Space: Aftermath, and after sitting down last night to watch the movie I am quite undecided on how I feel about it.  Overall I enjoyed the movie, but Ill freely admit there were a number of flaws.  Ill try to objectively address both the flaws, and some of the harsher criticisms out there so that you can get a clear unbiased opinion of the product.

Ill start out saying that up to this point Ive felt that every installation in the Dead Space ""universe"" has added to the story depth; from the original motion comic that was released in installments leading up to Dead Space, or Extraction, to the book Martyr or even Dead Space: Downfall, they have all added depth to the overall story.  Dead Space: Aftermath does not hold true to this in my opinion.  It explains how Nolan Strauss was exposed to the Marker, but it feels a bit contrived.  Dont take that to mean it isn't enjoyable or worth your time, but don't buy it feeling you ""have"" to buy it so you don't miss something.

This was a well made product, both the slip cover that came on the movie (it is more of a matte finish than Dead Space: Downfall), and the actual movie.  I can understand that not everyone will enjoy the ""art direction"" of the movie, but it is all well done. Dead Space: Aftermath is structured in five parts, there is the ""present"" where a rescue ship comes in to recover any survivors of the USG OBANNON and subsequently interrogate them, and then there is a ""flashback"" the experiences of each of the four survivors.  Each one of these five sections has its own animation style.  In my opinion this is both good and bad.  Its enjoyable to see the different takes on the Dead Space universe, but it can be difficult to keep track of who is who.  Dr Cho, for instance, has short hair in the beginning, but in the first flashback sequence has very long hair, and this wasn't because she ended up cutting it, it was just a difference in ""vision"".  I didn't like some of the liberties they took.  In the final flashback the necromorphs were 40 feet tall with massive muscles with pointy clawed fingernails instead of the bone blades that come over their shoulders.

The four animated flashbacks were all well done (even if I didn't approve of some of the liberties they took), but they were four different styles and not everyone likes every style of anime so this may be an issue for some.  The bigger issue if the animation style of the ""present"". They use a CGI / Cell Shaded style of animation for everything thats not a flashback.  This actually looks pretty good when you see the ships and shuttles and such in space.  Even the Marines in their suits look pretty good.  Where it falls a little flat is in small details, ie there aren't any.  Peoples faces have very little detail, the rooms are practically empty of any items that are directly interacted with.  Some people have complained that ""the PS2 had better CGI than"" Dead Space: Aftermath.  This is either ignorant, or reactionary, the PS2 never had anything this highly rendered.  That being said, it is more akin to some of the Saturday morning cartoons these days that use CGI, which really isn't a compliment.

A number of people have complained that there was all this ""gratuitous violence and nudity"".  Anyone who knows anything about Dead Space doesnt really have a plasma-amputated leg to stand on in complaining about violence.  In a game designed around dismemberment as the best way to kill the bad guys, violence is to be expected.  Nudity on the other hand, well this is the first nudity Ive seen in the series (unless you count Lexine in Extraction being naked, even though you don't see ""anything"").  There is a brief flash of bra in one flashback, and the last flashback has naked breasts during a ""sexual situation"" scene.  Neither instance was required, so by definition yes, it was gratuitous.  But unlike how some people have made it out to be, its inconsequential.  If you're under the age of 13 this might be quite a sight to see, but if you're old enough to buy the movie its nothing more than laughable.  (I watched this with my friend, and we both laughed and he said ""oh silly cartoon boobs"").

Im giving this 4 stars because I enjoyed the movie despite its flaws, and I don't regret buying it.  The Bluray price was a little steep, but Id buy it again if I had it to do over again.  If you're a big Dead Space fan, buy it, youll most likely enjoy it.  If you're not a fan, youll be wasting your money, instead consider buying Dead Space 1 and see if you get into it first.  Either way don't expect groundbreaking anime or secret conspiracies to be revealed here, you really aren't missing much that relates tot he bigger Dead Space universe.",1299628800,2,4769,4.509895227008149

Dead Space Aftermath crosses two paths, the path of those who love the first and second Dead Space video games and just crave more of the story, and the second if you like violent bloody anime.

Dead Space delivers 100% on both. If you don't like violence in your anime then DO NOT BUY IT and do not complain about it afterwords, it is Dead Space after all. Dead Space Aftermath is basically a ""prequel"" to the first video game. So if you're interested how the entire story began then you should definitely pick this up.

4285417,3,B0047S4UPW,"Being a big fan of the original Dead Space and having just finished Dead Space 2, I was eager to see the back story between the two.  Dead Space: Aftermath, more or less, fills in the gap with an hour and a half long compilation of differing stories from survivors (post Dead Space at Aegis VII) done in a different animation style with each story.  On the surface this is a creative idea as the different animations styles are to reflect each survivor's perspective on what happened at Aegis VII.  This similar style was used by Bungie and Microsoft Studios when making Halo: Legends so it is plausible to make a similar success.

However, what the audience gets is a chopper animation film where the styles distract, rather than add, to the films artistic merit with a story that is nothing short of confusing if not annoying.  This 'film' should have been released as a pre-release downloadable content (DLC) for all three systems rather than make the fans pay X amount to get more confused.

Let us begin.

The animation styles are choppy at best and are not even that artistic.  They begin with a 2nd generation CGI style that looks strikingly like the Reboot television series from the mid-1990s.  This isn't artistic, it's annoying not to mention annoying to rehash a style not used since for almost a decade.  I couldn't get passed the first animation style and it was the most prominent.  The other animation styles really didn't differ from each other rather than character projections, which vary slightly.  This makes the animations a distraction rather than sauce for the goods, taking away from the experience.

The story from the original Dead Space was amazing in that the antagonists were mindless monsters that came out of nowhere with nothing but ""kill you all"" on their minds, they needed no emotions or dialog.  There were hints of the human elements with Sciento-... er... Unitologists, followers of the dominant religion, tried to halt the progress of the protagonist in the original Dead Space.  In both Aftermath and Dead Space 2, it seems as though the human element takes place over the necromorph monsters, thus making both not scary at all.

If there is one thing that ruins any piece of media is complicating the crap out of any conspiracy.  It's annoying and you begin to wonder if the writers are just making up crap as they go.  Aftermath does this by making the events of the original Dead Space one big conspiracy with interwoven honeycombs of more conspiracies.  *shakes head*  Why oh why would Visceral do this?

Needless to say, Aftermath is not worth any money any retailer would ask for.  This should have been free for download prior to the release of Dead Space 2.  Remedy Entertainment created a pre-release series for Alan Wake (""Bright Falls"") but allowed the general audience to watch it for free... and it was considerably higher quality.  Visceral should have followed the example of Remedy Entertainment and done the same.  Aftermath is a rental at best.",1297900800,2,3003,4.818359375
4285418,4,B0047S4UPW,"On the sliding scale of quality, it's really difficult to assign a star rating to some products.  I mean, let's be honest, Dead Space: Aftermath isn't going to win any awards for either originality or quality.  In Electronic Arts' push to be all inclusive in their franchise IPs, many of their games are being spammed into every possible media category, like movies, toys, comic books, web series, etc.  I watched the original cartoon movie, Dead Space: Downfall, and I didn't really care for it.  It was entertaining, but wasn't really much more than an amalgamation of many better sci-fi and horror concepts.  Pre-release reviews and discussions about Dead Space: Aftermath made me hesitant to even purchase the movie, even though I really enjoy the games and the lore behind them.  So when I was offered a free copy of Aftermath to review, I figured, ""why the hell not?""  I was pleasantly surprised.

Don't get me wrong, Aftermath isn't a great movie.  Sometimes, it isn't even a real good one.  But I was entertained all the way through and for fans of the video game, it provides a nice little transition to Dead Space 2.  The story in Aftermath concerns itself with the USG O'Bannon, a space ship sent to everyone's favorite Dead Space planet, under the guise of stabalizing it with some gravitational devices.  The secret underlying mission, however, is to retrieve portions of the Marker that everyman engineer Isaac Clarke destroyed in the original Dead Space.  Aftermath is a framed narrative story, taking place in a cold and sterile interrogation room where the remaining four survivors of the USG O'Bannon are being questioned by some pesky religious nuts of Unitology.  Each character has a piece of the puzzle as to what exactly happened on O'Bannon.  This allows the directors to tell individual stories seeing the action from different perspectives, a device that includes different animation styles and some wildly different-looking characters.

I really enjoyed watching Aftermath, even though it's not that great of a film.  One of the characters is even instrumental in Dead Space 2 and it was interesting to see how he was prior to the game.  Anyway, I enjoyed this film a lot more than Downfall (even though it seems that overall this one has been receiving worse reviews).  Fans of the games should probably check it out (i.e. rent).",1297900800,,2357,4.936548223350254
4285419,3,B0047S4UPW,"I'm a fan of the Dead Space game series. I've played both for more than one playthrough (actually several), and greatly liked the atmosphere. Thus this movie - Dead Space Aftermath - make sense for me, however I don't think it will appeal to the average viewer.

It tells the story of what happens between the two games, focusing on mostly irrelevant cast, with few exceptions. However the important details can already be inferred during the play-through of the second game, while the rest is already forgettable.

For someone outside the audience of the game, I don't think that the story will make much sense. Overall the events are unexciting, the horror is low, and overall story is average. There are almost no shocking revelations, except for one good item. Unfortunately revealing that would be a major spoiler for the movie.

Overall I'd recommend it as a rental to the fans, and maybe purchase to serious collectors of the series. Otherwise you can easily find better entertainment for your money and your time. I'm giving it three stars for the effort.",1297814400,,1063,4.861878453038674

The DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, which in my opinion was very well implemented, blending seamlessly with the movie for an overall excellent experience that helps pull the viewer into the the story.

I do wish this movie had been rated, or at least had a label warning of the nude content and strong language used in the animation. Anyone not familiar with what Dead Space is would probably be in for a surprise if they just bought it on a whim for their children.",1297814400,,856,4.731543624161074
4285422,2,B0047S4UPW,"I'm going to note right off the bat, that I've never played any of the Dead Space games, though I did watch the first Dead Space animation, ""Downfall,"" and found it enjoyable, which is why I eagerly order this.  I'm not sure whether or not playing the game would've helped make this movie more enjoyable, but I'd highly doubt it.

""Aftermath"" follows the story from the first animation, where a salvage crew sets off to find remnants of a powerful alien artifact and the chaos and that ensues upon their contact with it.  The story is told through vignettes of each of the surviving crew members who are being interrogated by members of the ruthless corporation who sent them on their mission.

While I like ""Rashomon""-style movies, this one was predictable and boring and the animation was terrible.  Of course, I'm not expecting Akira Kurosawa-level storytelling here, but I didn't find any of the characters likable (or likable enough to survive) and outcomes were telegraphed or cliched so badly that you're not surprised when anything happens (not that you'd care, given the poor character development).  What good is survival horror if there is no suspense?  I know it's what makes me enjoy games like ""Resident Evil.""  Also, I understand using expletives to show emotion, but more often than not, the use of profanity here was just gratuitous.  To the writers:  Unnecessary swearing here and there doesn't make a movie/game look mature, rather it makes it look less mature--like a ten year old cussing to sound like he's twenty.

Regarding the animation, each vignette was done by a different team and I thought all were terrible.  The over-arcing storyline is done using 3D computer models in a not-quite cel-shaded style and it looked jerky and reminiscent of something I'd see on a kids cartoon eight or ten years ago.  The vignettes were done in traditional 2D animation (some using a Japanese anime style), but the designs varied too much from scene to scene and none of them were memorable.  In my opinion, even regular TV cartoons, like ""Young Justice,"" are better animated than any of the five vignettes on this disc.  Even ""Dante's Inferno"" (which I often use as the basis for awful video game-related animation) had at least one or two inventive, well-animated sequences.

Overall, if you're looking for a compilation-type work of quality animation, I'd suggest something like ""Animatrix,"" ""Halo Legends"" or ""Batman: Gotham Knight.""  If you're looking for a good sci-fi horror movie, watch the ""Alien"" trilogy.  The only group of people who might be interested in this would be fans of the game, though if you're expecting something better than the first DVD, ""Downfall,"" you'll be sorely disappointed.",1297728000,,2719,4.991130820399113
4285423,4,B0047S4UPW,"I liked the movie, though I found the animation less than what I expected.  However, it really does imitate ""Dead Space"" the game.  The story was great.  I am 56 Y/O, but I can appreciate a good suspense/space flick.  A team is put together to accomplish a difficult feat on an unstable planet.  The masterminds behind the feat do not tell the characters many things, like how dangerous it is.  They pass many trials, some die, but at the end there is a smart surprise. It is well-written I believe.  Occasionally there are glimpses of real characters in space suits if you watch closely.  The animation is predominant throughout the feature, though.  Don't get me wrong; the animation is well-done; however, it is not like the best of the best.  On the other hand it must imitate the game, and it does that well.",1297641600,,813,4.583333333333333
4285424,3,B0047S4UPW,"Based on a series of videogames, ""Dead Space: Aftermath"" features a plot you'll either find comfortably familiar or painfully derivative (I kept going back and forth).  Anyway, the story revolves around a cold, calculating corporation and its cold, calculating scientists using a bunch of U.S. Marines-style space soldiers to test out the effects of some kind of mysterious space artifact, an artifact that horribly mutates anyone who comes in contact with it.

Of course, the evil corporate types think that the artifact's powers can be harnessed and controlled, despite the fact that all evidence indicates that it simply turns anyone who comes in contact with it into a hideous, slobbering monster.  See what I mean, though?  If you've seen all the ""Alien"" and ""Resident Evil"" movies, you've pretty much seen this.

Still, the production is polished and well-produced, with the different animation segments nicely organized and presented (as each surviving Marine flashes back to the events leading up to the carnage that killed virtually everyone on their ship, a different Japanese director takes over the storytelling for that segment).  Just be warned, the creators were given free reign over the amount of violence and colorful language they wanted to employ to tell the movie's story.  And they chose to use a lot of both.

I predict that fans of the ""Dead Space"" videogames will likely enjoy this film, with animation and science-fiction fans (I'm in this group) probably finding it at least tolerably interesting.  Everyone else will most likely peg it as shrill and unpleasant.  In other words, the movie is definitely aimed at a niche audience.  If you're not in that niche, steer clear.",1297382400,,1700,5.1454545454545455
4285425,5,B0047S4UPW,"What happened after??

That is the question that Joe Goyette, Mike Disa, and Film Roman answer.  The year 2059 sees the loss of contact with Earth, and Isaac Clarke by the ship USG Ishimura.  Only four survivors of the USG O'Bannon can help investigators piece together what happened, and why.

The result is a splendid animated film that hits the highs and is voice by Christopher Judge, Peter Woodward, Graham McTavish, Ricardo Chavira, and Gwendoline Yeo.  High production values and solid writing make this a must view.

I loved the film, it is great as a stand alone product, but even better with the game to fall back on.",1297296000,,627,4.706422018348624
4285426,3,B0047S4UPW,"I am reviewing this as a stand-alone movie, as I am not familiar with the Dead Space video game series. So this review will be more of interest to other people who are not familiar or interested in the video games. For example, Stargate SG-1 fans may be interested as Christopher Judge (Teal'c of Chulak) is one of the voice-actor stars. Also of interest to sci-fi fans, Peter Woodward (Galen of B5's Crusade among others) is voice-acting here as well.

This is an animated sci-fi survival-horror animation, running under 80 minutes long. You can watch it as a stand-alone piece and actually not knowing or reading plot summaries makes the initial mystery more interesting. I watched this DVD first, before discovering that there is an older movie in the series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Space-Downfall/dp/B0018TAFQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Space: Downfall</a>, that came out with the original Dead Space video game. This movie (Dead Space: Aftermath) is coming out together with the follow-up to the original game. If you are more of a completist, watching the movies in chronological order is slightly better, but they are relatively self-contained.

The cool thing with these is that the movies are serving as continuation points between the video games. Even if you are not interested in the video games, it is nice to see people finding creative ways to interconnect different types of media.

The movie itself is interesting, watchable, and keeps your attention going. It is a sci-fi animation, of the horror-survival type. There is gore and carnage but since it is animated, it is nowhere near as stomach-turning (for some people) as similar live-action movies. There is some promise and premise in the mysterious alien artifact to perhaps expand this to a live-action or animated TV mini or regular series, but this movie only scratches the surface. This is closer to the Syfy original movies than Battlestar Galactica.

The DVD includes the movie, your choice of subtitles, scene selection, trailers, and that's it. The packaging is nice with a cardboard sleeve over the DVD case, but content-wise the cardboard and case have the same graphics and text.

So, should you buy it if you are not a fan of the video game series or a Judge/Woodward die-hard fan? My opinion is to watch the movie first and then decide whether you want to buy it.",1297209600,,2411,5.203608247422681
4285427,3,B0047S4UPW,"Coming late to the Dead Space franchise, I recently started playing the game on our PS3.  My enjoyment of the game attracted me to a SyFy presentation, Dead Space Declassified, which aired Dead Space: Downfall and explained the methods behind this animation's creation.  It was then I decided to watch Dead Space: Aftermath.

The DVD begins with an entertaining Dead Space 2 trailer, before providing the main menu.  The menu is limited to the featured presentation as well as trailers for Dead Space 2, Dante's Inferno (anime), Let Me In (movie), and The Bleeding (movie).  The main menu also includes Set Up options limited to subtitles in English SDH and Spanish, plus the typical scene selection page.

The story revolves around the four survivors of the O'Bannon sent to hold the planet Aegis VII together.  The anime is rendered in 2D except when each survivor recalls the events leading up to being rescued which is drawn in 3D.  However using 2D rendering for the non-memory portions made the characters look flat, and cheaply produced.  I could visually understand I was watching real time as opposed to memories, but I found the 2D was just too different and distracting.

Each survivor's memories were created using differing animation styles.  Artistically I liked this creative choice.  Showing the survivor's memories in this manner portrayed each character's personal perspective and perception of their surroundings.  Each following memory added new information to clarify and develop a complete story of the events on the O'Bannon.  Using differing animation styles for each survivor's memories worked well, but some characters appeared so different between each memory it has the potential to cause a little confusion.

The dialog also includes a healthy dose of foul language.  This is an adult animation, and reality indicates people in stressful situations tend to swear.  While there was plenty of profanity from the various characters, it didn't seem to be used solely for shock value.

Overall, I enjoyed watching Dead Space: Aftermath.  The story was entertaining, but isn't something I would want to purchase for my movie collection.  I would recommend renting or downloading Dead Space: Aftermath instead.

PROS:
Artistic creative choices
Entertaining

CONS:
No extras worth mentioning",1297123200,,2312,5.276712328767124
4285428,1,B0047S4UPW,"I have to say that Dead Space Aftermath was a big disappointment after watching Dead Space Downfall and playing the Dead Space video game.  The first time I watched a piece of this movie was on YouTube, and at first I thought I had accidentally clicked on a video for the Dead Space 2 game walkthrough instead of the actual Dead Space Aftermath movie because of the way the animation had been done.  Of course, after I bought the movie I found out otherwise.  At first, the animation looks like something out of a kids movie or video game; then all of the sudden it goes to a much better looking animation like the Dead Space Downfall movie as each of the survivors recalls their nightmarish encounters to the interrogators, which makes no sense to me.  That was incredibly stupid for anyone to do, and it makes the movie very disordered and hard to follow.  The looks and animation also change slightly with each survivors story, making the characters appear different, which was also a stupid thing to do.  They should have picked one thing and stuck with it like they did in the first movie.  I felt like I was watching something that multiple people with multiple ideas and animation designs had just slapped together and put their ideas and pieces of the story where ever they could find a place, and I was suppose to try and make sense of all this.  I did understand the movie enough to know what was going on, but even then I was still unimpressed.  Half the movie seems to concentrate on unimportant matters, such as the doc's affair with the woman he works with and his wife's suspicions about it.  That was a stupid part to put in the movie considering what the movie is suppose to be about, aliens and the marker shard.  The movie doesn't get really interesting until about the last twenty minutes or so when the woman doctor tells about how she and the other survivors worked together to destroy the shard.  The end of the movie was not very clear either, as were many other parts of the movie.  In my opinion, this movie was poorly done and that made it a flop.  Between the variation in animation designs throughout the entire movie and the concentration on unimportant matters like an affair and many parts of the story filling your head with uncertainty and confusion,  I wouldn't waste the money on this.",1297123200,6,2321,4.545673076923077

4285431,3,B0047S4UPW,"Actually its probably less then what you'd expect from a movie based on a video game. Most of those, like Doom, were at least live action, not animated. And this isn't the best animation either. Final Fantasy it is not. Perhaps its animated rather then live action because the level of carnage is beyond what you'd see in all but the most extreme gore fest movies. Babies, kids, characters you assume are main characters or heroes, none are safe from grizzly deaths. And in parts, lots of foul language is used. I guess its to give the film street creed with the game's target audience of teenage boys. However, it sometimes comes across as awkward and forced and I laughed more then once at its absurdity. Much of the story reminded me of the underlying theme of the Alien saga. An incredible monstrous force is discovered and the powers that be don't want to destroy it or avoid it, they want to harness it. The twist here being this monstrous force may be an artifact from aliens that had created mankind and the monsters are what man is supposed to have become. I would not be surprised if the writer had spent a weekend watching zombie movies, 2001, 2010 and some of the Alien films just before he came up with this movie/game's main premise. If you are into the game, sure, see the movie I guess. If you are not into it, probably no reason to see it. Its definitely not Resident Evil quality.",1297123200,,1398,4.486274509803922

Dead Space Aftermath is more like a Saturday morning cartoon peppered with gratuitous language, violence, occasional innuendo.  I hope this isn't an indicator of the direction Electronic Arts is going!! Up to this point, EA has been my favorite game producer, genrally on the cutting edge of graphics and animation.  In that regard, Dead Space was not too bad, the characters were reeasonably well drawn, but the rest, a good deal less satisfying.  I generally do not like this genre (and picked it up, having mistaken it for grade B sci-fi).  That said, the other video game tie-in movies I've seen, while not my favorites, were *a lot* better than this.  It is more like an over-long infomercial.

I suppose seeing this did do something for me.  I know what series my kids will not be playing, and will check every EA title out before I pick it up from now on.  Too bad!  i thought Electronic Arts could be counted on for innovation and good game play.  This looks like it is being pitched at the slightly too old for the playground set: 14-16 year old boys (the demographic described as having disposable income, because they have no expenses...)
I would recommend (maybe that is too strong a word) this for parents if you want to get a sense of what is being pitched to your kids.
I have to wonder why anyone would enjoy watching this?  Video game movies are, for the most part,  like badly written games; the ones with a single plot line which is not effected by your actions.  Is the story line in the game so muddled that it needs something like this to explain it?  I'll never know unless someone tells me, as this is not a game series destined for my house.",1296950400,4,1933,4.402816901408451

While I enjoyed the quality of the animation, the writing and story line were a bit weak and most likely created for kids. Not quite in the same league as Ghost in the Shell or Vexille, but close. Lots of action and gore, which will please some.

My experience with it started out badly, as the disc cover was stuck to the paper outer cover, which I had to rip open to get the case free. From then on, it was the usual battle with plastic wrap and security sticker, but that is the case with all DVDs.

There were some sections in which the characters were drawn differently, and that was in some of the flashbacks, which may have been from the previous movie (this is a sequel). It was a little odd, but did not detract too much, although I wonder if it was worth the cost saving of re-animating those  scenes.

Nothing new, inspirational, or particularly noteworthy, but an okay diversion. Not something I would watch over again, but I don't feel like I wasted my time with it.",1296864000,,1085,4.405
4285434,4,B0047S4UPW,"Dead Space Aftermath sports some decent production values. This movie has two animation styles, assisting the viewer with differentiating between past and present events. The present events in the movie are animated closer to CGI, while events in the past are 2-D animations similar to old Saturday-morning cartoons or Anime. At first I couldn't understand why the animation style was changing, and thought they tried to piece together two productions. This style started to make sense, however, as the movie progressed.

The movie helps fill the gap between the ending of Dead Space and the beginning of Dead Space 2. It does so very well. If you played Dead Space, the movie references events that took place at the end of that game. It then forms a bridge between Dead Space and the very beginning of Dead Space 2. It creates the backstory for a particular character that appears in Dead Space 2.

I decided to watch this movie while more than half-way through my playthrough of Dead Space 2. With the knowledge gained from this movie, a particular character in the game now makes much more sense....as a character. In no way do I feel the movie spoils the game.

The movie uses a lot of the technology you use in the Dead Space game franchise. The sounds are lifted from the game. Vocals through Rigs have the appropriate affects applied. The atmosphere is pure ""Dead Space"". It's a good piece of the Dead Space universe.

Is it necessary to watch this film? Probably not, which is why I conclude it's only for fans of the series. If you consume everything ""Dead Space"", and want to know every part of the story and its universe, then you will want to watch this movie.

Hyper violent. It appears to be set between the first game and the new one.

This is a space age shoot-em-up Anime ghost story. Reminiscent of the last work on Animatrix, but instead of internal dialogues, you have the corporations/government as the bad guys (this was old when Aliens splashed across the screen).

If you watched the first film, you could tell the animation didn't look at that good, but the movie was driven by a strong story.  Well, this one makes no difference.  I did watch the BLU RAY version, and WOW.  It kicks the first film out the water in terms of animation.  In ""real time"" the film is is told in CGI, and granted it's no Dreamworks quality, it holds up pretty good.  When the story goes back in flash backs, it goes into complete animation, like the first film, and I personally though it was genius to do it that way.  I'm not going to give away anything of the film, but if you seen the first one, and liked it, or sort of liked this, chances are your going to enjoy this one twice over.

CGI:

Not the best out there, but pretty well done and gruesome. I really enjoy how the blood splatters really give it a creepy scene, especially on the little girl. The ship looked pretty decent as well as the lava. Can't expect much from a cgi movie but nontheless it was truly believable in my mind.

Story:
Storywise, it was good but felt a lot like vantage point. The story deals with four characters telling their side of the story and telling what really happened. Overall it was pretty decent to see what they could come up with.

Overall:

I could go on a lot saying all these facts on how the movie can be either good or bad, but really it depends on your own personal thoughts. I would suggest a rental if you don't like how the story is told but it isn't a bad movie for me. Of course with greater technology and better stories one can argue. What I find a bit disturbing and out of place is the product placement of dante's inferno within the movie. Not only do they talk about the game without saying the name but they also mention the movie.

What I didn't like of the movie is how everything got explained rather quickly. The voices could have been picked better but it was very believable in some scenes while others will make one go say ""really?"" The movie will differ from tastes by people but to each their own.

Downfall was good with the right atmosphere, great story line and everything was frigging amazing. In aftermath, the story is junk, not exciting, in fact 115 minutes of boredom. CGI is exceptionally bad. And then they mixed it all with a cartoon. This is extremely bad, poor in every way animation. The best of the anime makers supposed to be blended in the aftermath project. But it is so very bad. Even when 1 of 5 marines gets killed by survivors, the other 4 act like as if nothing happened. Literally, as if nothing happened. All they did was just electroshock the survivors and not say a word, not even sigh about the dead marine. In fact we don't even see a dead marine in a close up. All you can see is him flying after a shot somewhere. This animation lacks everything, from a-z. But what we get to know is a preview to a dead space 2 game. A very bad preview where we know that Isaac will be back. And you won't even see Isaac.
Just outstanding character development. I give it a whole 0.

It's a middle of the road sort of film.  I also bought and own the first Dead Space game.  This is one of my all-time favorite video games.  It's the perfect mix of sci-fi and horror.  Everything in that game was well done from the music, graphics, sound, lighting, storyline, the directing,  voice acting, atmosphere, the use of technology, high tech weaponry, and the menacing presence of the most hideous-dangerous  monsters/aliens (the Necromorphs) to every appear in a video game.  All of these things to me have made this one of the scariest video games ever made (the scariest one is Silent Hill 1 in my  opinion).  I also pre-ordered Dead Space 2 collector's edition.

That said, I'm definitely a fan of the series (at least the game version).  This new Dead Space movie isn't nearly as abysmal as some may lead you to believe.  Let's start with the story.  The story begins with a rescue mission.  A rescue crew arrives aboard the USG O'Bannon to find all of the crew slaughtered except for 4 people.  The rest of the story unfolds during the interrogation of the four survivors.  They are each interrogated one at a time.  Each person's story is told with a different animation style and by a different director.

I found that the quality of the voice work on this project to be solid.  People were convincing in the delivery of their line and each voice actor was well chosen for the character they played.  I enjoyed the way the story unfolded through the different perspectives.  Each person's perspective added a touch of something new to the story. I found Alejandro Borges to be the only likeable character even though he isn't the most well-rounded.  I also liked how the filmmakers made some connects between this film and the upcoming Dead Space game which adds some value to this film for Dead Space Fans.  I don't want to give this away what those connections are, so I'll let all you Dead Space Fan's see for yourself.

Now let's get to the bad.  The present tense animation is computer animation, however this animation is very bad (very reminiscent of the awful show Reboot or Play station one cut scenes).  The people look very fake and generic.  There isn't a whole of detail or realism in their appearance or movements.  Also the last story's animation which is told from Isabel Cho's perspective is also bad (it looks like the awful animation style that was used in the Aeon Flux television series which aired in the 90's on MTV).  Everyone's appearance also kept changing during each story.  Also no one looked the way they did in the computer animation which meant you had to take time to figure out who was who, which was initially distracting.

Overall, I never thought that this was a quick cash grab like Star Wars the Force Unleashed 2 was for Lucas arts.  Nor do I feel like I wasted $13.00 (that's price I paid for this film) or my time watching this film.  Is this better than Dead Space: Downfall?  The answer to this question will depend on who you ask.

8418299,2,B0047S4UPW,"If you want to see the sequel to Dead Space Downfall, then get this (or rent from local movie place). Otherwise don't waste your money For me, did not like the animation, cheaply done, their budget was either very small or something. Would gave it a one star, but wanted to see the sequel, to see what happen with the story, and still wasn't what I thought. Unfortunately, there seem to be a gap between Dead Space Downfall and Dead Space Aftermath. Did not play the game so don't know if the game was the missing storyline. Graphic was horrible, you keep feeling the movie wasn't done, rushed job or something, or thinking the animation, CG, will get better halfway into the movie. What you see at the beginning, is what you will see at the end credits. If you can rent it for $0.99 from some local movie/book store, sure, but you still feel something was missing and unfinished. It felt more you where watching it in Alpha stage of the development, not even Beta stage.  Storyline was ok. Really did not like the animation, was awful.",1455408000,,1036,4.51063829787234
