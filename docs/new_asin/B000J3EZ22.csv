2666786,4,B000J3EZ22,"I saw this film at the Atlanta film festival and enjoyed it quite a bit. Very clever script, with all manner of groan-inducing sock puns. It was also well-directed, especially considering the budget. They put a lot of care into the production design, and the story flows at a nice pace. The film is basically appropriate for kids, but adults will enjoy the humor and the noir references. OK, so maybe it's not CITIZEN KANE--thankfully it's not Welle's shockingly amateurish IMMORTAL STORY, either! But it's entertaining and certainly worth a look.",1161734400,2,547,5.021978021978022

8149017,5,B000J3EZ22,"Feeling down at heel? Worn out? Kids getting underfoot? This, then, is the sort of film you'll want to kick off your shoes and slip into!
A genuinely funny, kid-friendly flick with one toe in the world of film noir, and the other in a vaguely Henson-like turn before the footlights.
Danger looms in a WWII-era, sock puppet world where Knitler has risen to power, good people live hand-to-mouth, and the fabric of society is jeopardized by enemies both without and within.
In this high-heat setting, the film spins a yarn about P.I. Terrance M. Cotton, an honest sock whose world is coming undone. He's picked up a bottle-a-day bleach habit and he ain't drinkin' the good stuff. To the walk-up office of this washed-up, hung-out-to-dry gumsock comes desperate wife Heelda Brum, looking for information on her missing husband. You know how it is when one of a pair goes missing...
The news isn't good and even the well-turned Heelda takes on a funny smell... But Terrence is on this case and he ain't comin' off. He'll turn the town inside-out looking for whodunnit...
Was it Big Toe-ny, the rotgut merchant? Was it one of his small-time footpads? A slipper-y, chop-socky Chinatown assassin, maybe? Could Terrence's Argyle assistant be hiding a checkered past? The secrets keep coming in this finely-woven mystery that's intricate, but never stretched-out.
The humor is arch and the wit couldn't be dryer! A theme of tolerance threads it's way through the proceedings, and the film-making is anything but pedestrian.
A love of wordplay and classic film is evident throughout this enjoyable picture. Put it on and feel the warmth.",1295222400,2,1627,4.9633699633699635
8149018,5,B000J3EZ22,"""Lady from Sockholm"" is a fabulously clever and charming ""yarn"" good for all ages!  Dialogue is quick and witty, pace is consistently smooth and progressive, there is not a dull moment or a lag in laughs! I can highly recommend to anyone.  Congratulations to everyone involved with this movie, it is a WINNER!",1192320000,,309,4.811320754716981
8149019,4,B000J3EZ22,"Like the classic film noirs that it spoofs, if you only view this once all the pieces may not fall into place... but they do.  It's just a lot to take in (the puns, plot and puppets) with only one viewing. I've watched it 3 times now and I catch something new each time.  If you're not a repeat movie watcher, one viewing will give you laughs and a good film noir storyline, but for me the deeper meaning was more apparent after the second viewing.",1172275200,,448,4.1976744186046515
8149020,5,B000J3EZ22,"Are you sick of the dumbed-down kids flicks?

This is a full-length film that adults can watch and get as much enjoyment, if not more, than the kids. I find it refreshing that for a kid-friendly film, that some of the jokes are only recognizable by the adult audience. It's obvious that this was a well-thought out production from the rich, detailed sets and the large cast of costumed sock puppets. The lighting gave the film that authentic ""Film Noir"" feel.",1167868800,3,459,4.666666666666667
8149021,5,B000J3EZ22,"I found this to be an incredibly well-developed yarn (yarn, get it? Ha). It's knee-slappingly funny and literally one-of-a-kind. Enjoyable for adults as well as their kids in a way that is much smarter than the drivel kids normally get. The scenery, filming and artwork are stunners -- the sewing details of the sock-puppet ""actors"" alone is worth twice the price of the DVD -- but it's the story itself that is the real surprise. No threads left hanging here, it's a wonderfully textured epic that thoroughly spoofs the Philip Marlow/film noir genre in the most inventive way I've ever seen.",1164844800,,592,4.871287128712871
8149022,5,B000J3EZ22,"Was able to catch this movie at the Mill Valley film festival last year and I'm really excited this film is finally out on DVD.  I'm a big film noir fan and love the old masterpieces like the Maltese Falcon, Kiss Me Deadly and of course, the Lady from Shanghai.  The Lady from Sockholm works because it pays homage to these great films while also creating a new and fresh take to the genre.

Also, this movie works on so many different levels.  It's a kid movie.  It has rich sets and colorful puppets.  What kid can resist that?  It's also a well written story.  Anyone who's seen the crap that Hollywood puts out these days can attest to the woeful need for well written stories.  The Lady from Sockholm certainly fits this bill.  Lastly, this movie works from a cinephile point of view.  With numerous slick references to old film noir movies and film history in general (keep in eye out for the use of an old silent film favorite), any cinephile will be tickled by this nod to their love of film.

I love this movie, and I think you will too.",1163548800,4,1046,4.335051546391752
8149023,5,B000J3EZ22,"I was so surprised and thrilled when I saw this DVD available online for purchase.  I caught this at a local film festival and just loved it.  The entire audience was laughing out loud the whole time.  The puppets are adorable and the writing is clever, witty and full of more sock puns that keep you laughing.  This is great, clean entertainment for kids and adults.

I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a gift this holiday season or just to enjoy themselves.",1163548800,4,480,4.534883720930233
