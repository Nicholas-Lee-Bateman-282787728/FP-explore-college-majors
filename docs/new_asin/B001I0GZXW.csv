8310313,4,B001I0GZXW,Interesting -- always nice to see younger folks taking an interest in Shakespeare -- I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor's talk on his early experience with Shakespeare and the monologue (I think from Hamlet) he did.  Tom Hanks was great as well.,1309651200,,237,4.925
8310314,2,B001I0GZXW,"WHY SHAKESPEARE? is a short documentary presented by the National Endowment for the Arts. The purpose of the DVD is to illustrate the importance of reading, studying, and performing Shakespeare's works. There are a few short clips with famous actors, lesser known directors, younger people who have started their own theatre groups, and a few students. Each gives a short snippet about how the works of Shakespeare have affected their lives. There are also several segments where one of the interviewees recites a passage from Shakespeare.

There are some that are mistaken and seem to believe this documentary is supposed to be a basic look at Shakespeare or his works. That is not what this DVD is. It is intended to be a tool to illustrate why people (particularly students) should read, study, and perform Shakespeare and in that intention it fails miserably.

Originally sent out to schools and educators free as part of the Shakespeare in American Communities program. I was under the impression that the DVD should be used to show to students as a tool in illustrating the importance of Shakespeare. However, it's also been suggested that the DVD be shown to school officials and administrators to illustrate why they should develop or continue to support theatre education, particularly Shakespeare. Whatever the case, the DVD is incredibly boring. I work with middle school and high school students and most would be bored as a lazy crocodile within three minutes. The most interesting part about the DVD, and really the only one that most students might get a basic understanding of why Shakespeare is important is the 30 second segment that displays all the various names and places that have been taken from Shakespeare; from street signs to restaurants, to storefronts. As for school officials and administrators, there is very little in here that would sway an official one way or the other. The most interesting part of the whole DVD are the extra interviews in the special features, but most officials (and other people) don't have time to sit through a bunch of interviews which is sad because some of these interviews are very insightful and at times extremely engaging and a few even moving.

WHY SHAKESPEARE? is a DVD that school libraries should probably have on hand and English teachers might want to watch it (particularly the longer interviews) to perhaps use as a segment in class. Other than that, you'll have to answer the question yourself.",1270771200,2,2469,5.002433090024331
8310315,1,B001I0GZXW,"This was an odd little documentary that seems to be worth about nothing. That's harsh, I know. I used this in my history course when we encountered English literature from this era and the students found it worth watching0 only because it was so short. I will not be using it again and am grateful that my copy was from the library. Since you can find it so cheap everywhere, take that as a clue. Look elsewhere for any sort of intro to the man and his work. Pretty useless.",1241308800,,474,4.277777777777778
8310316,5,B001I0GZXW,"This promotion of Shakespeare was underwritten by the National Endowment of the Arts.  (Is it not sad that such a great author should need promotion?)  At twenty minutes, it is very short, with fifteen or so persons giving recitations and commentary on various aspects of Shakespeare.  As a previously converted Shakespeare fan, I enjoyed it so much I watched the main documentary twice.  With knit eye brows, Tom Hanks looks almost in pain reciting Shakespeare.  (Clearly Hanks was recruited for his star attraction, not his Shakespearean skills.)  Chiwetel Ejiofor's recitation of Hamlet's ""What a rogue and peasant slave am I"" (in the main documentary) is spell-binding, and the DVD is worth watching for that alone.  The Special Features are also worth a look, containing extended interviews with the participants.  Especially insightful are Julie Taymor and Miles Beller.",1237161600,3,876,5.343065693430657
8310317,5,B001I0GZXW,"Presented by the National Endowment for the Arts, this is a short documentary (21 minutes) with a lot of additional commentary bonus material.

The documentary is comprised of clips of famous actors, directors and writers who speak of their experience with acting in Shakespeare productions in their school years and how it affected them in a positive way. Also interviewed are students who are acting in Shakespeare productions in schools. We hear of how acting in live stage productions (not just reading Shakespeare in classrooms) has positively affected the lives of inner city minority students. We hear that it was Shakespeare who saved some from joining gangs or dropping out of high school.

Another clear message is that Shakespeare's words are poetry and although they are not in the modern English we use today, his words, the characters and their struggles are still relevant to modern American culture.

The importance of experiencing live acted Shakespeare plays and the benefit of students acting in stage productions is a clear message in this documentary. Rafe Esquith's Hobart Shakespearians program for English as a Second Language students is mentioned briefly.

Sprinkled throughout we hear the actors reciting their favorite lines or telling who their favorite character is, and why.

The bonus material contains a bio and additional commentary from the people. On that menu page for each person are bullet points stating the main points of what they say in the bonus material (making it easy to find statements to match what you want the viewers to see).

It is obvious that the purpose of this documentary is to convince viewers, probably school systems and teachers, to create or continue to offer programs for school students to act in live stage productions of Shakespeare plays.  The documentary seems ideally suited to show to audiences that need convincing of this fact, whether they are school administrators, Boards of Education or Boards of Finance, or private investors who may donate money to productions for children to participate with (such as the Hobart Shakespeareans that takes donor money).

This documentary was well done and it was convincing. In just twenty minutes a powerful message is delivered. After watching it, I felt that in an ideal world every child would have an opportunity to act in a Shakespeare production and that all who ever have a chance will be affected in different ways, but definitely in a positive way.

What This Documentary is NOT

This movie is not an in-depth exploration of Shakespeare's work. This does not teach a school teacher why or how to teach Shakespeare as literature in a classroom. This does not teach a drama teacher how to run a live stage production of Shakespeare's plays. This is not an analysis of Shakespeare's plays. This is not Shakespeare 101. If you are looking for any of those things, you will be disappointed. I pointed out the strengths of the production and my hunch on why the production was made, for those purposes and those audiences this is an effective and useful twenty minute tool.

It is unfair to judge a documentary for not being what someone wishes it was. There is hardly any marketing material on the packaging and no promises are made that are not delivered.

NOTE: A second title is used on the packaging and on the documentary itself ""Shakespeare in American Communities"". That is the title of a national initiative of the National Endowment for the Arts. You can read more about it on their website.

NOTE: My edition is clearly marked ""Not For Resale"" and it does not have a retail price on it. According to the National Endowment for the Arts this item was released only to educators free of charge.",1236211200,3,3720,4.961414790996785
8310318,2,B001I0GZXW,"This is a short, choppy, documentary that only superficially touches the subject it examines.  There are a number of ""extra"" interviews and these are more entertaining then the documentary itself.  I paid about $3.00 for the dvd on Amazon and I would have to say I would not buy this film if I knew then what I know now.",1234483200,,320,4.406779661016949
