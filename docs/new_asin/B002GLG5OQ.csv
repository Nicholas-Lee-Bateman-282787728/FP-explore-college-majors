3924875,5,B002GLG5OQ,I liked the movie. The suspence kept me wondering who did committ the murders. It did show what can happen when someone gets greedy and the results of it.,1278288000,3,154,4.344827586206897
3924876,3,B002GLG5OQ,"This film would be good for people interested in the complex interaction between brothers.  ""Jason's Lyric"" and ""Boyz N Da Hood"" touched upon the same issue.  Here, three family members are killed and more and more the older surviving brother begins to suspect the younger.  But wives, girlfriends, nieces and nephews, sheriffs, and aunts all play into the mix.  Have you ever had a relative who did soemthing unethical, but then they'll respond to your accusation with, ""How can you accuse your dear, sweet relative of doing that!?""  This film touches upon that.  The film says it's based on a true story.  However, ever since learning that ""Fargo"" wasn't true, I don't give much credit to the ""true story"" bit.  You may want to see this film just to see J. Corbett's booty.  It doesn't come until near the very ends, but he does have some globes of which to be proud, assuming he didn't use a body double.
Actually, the more I type, the more I think I liked this film.  However, it is a bit dull.  It's not a true whodunit where you'd be surprised with the conclusion.  The disc doesn't have foreign language subtitles or extra features.  You can tell the film was done on a limited budget.  I mean, it's not awful, it's okay; it's just not ""The Color Purple"" or ""Joy Luck Club"" or something.",1273276800,2,1294,4.569565217391304

3924901,3,B002GLG5OQ,"Based on true story. A man, his wife and his young son are brutally murdered in their home, and the community bands around two brothers as they grieve the loss of their family members. But one tenacious detective thinks the killer is a lot closer to home.

Walker Morrison (John Corbett) is stunned as evidence quickly begins to mount against his younger brother Luke (Jonathan Scarfe), who stands to gain not only half of the family's assets but all of his father's $200,000 insurance policy. This entire situation places a great strain on the brothers, and on the relationship between Walker and his wife Patti (Maya McLaughlin).

I felt the movie was rather dramatically stated (something you would expect from a low budget movie) and made an adequate attempt in telling the story, only a few changes were made from the real story - names were changed. And it was told with some subtlety, and showed the obvious conflict between justice and mercy in trying to bring some closure to the case. At the end no information relating to the real-life case was ever revealed.",1428105600,,1070,4.778378378378378

3924907,5,B002GLG5OQ,This true story of an Alabama family was of particular interest to me because the mother was my cousin my marriage. I did not learn of her death until seeing this movie in tv many years ago while visiting friends in Al.  It is roughly accurate in that the middle brother commits the murders but doesn't reflect the parents in the way the actually were.  This according to relatives who lived near then and were a part of of their lives.,1418428800,,436,4.37037037037037

3924909,5,B002GLG5OQ,I love this movie.  It is so very sad that a person could do this to their very own family and initially get away with it.  The ending is pure justice.,1415750400,,151,3.838709677419355

3924920,3,B002GLG5OQ,"Based on a shocking true story, The Morrison Murders is about a family ripped apart by uncontrollable jealousy, 2 brothers at dangerous odds, and the unbelievable truth behind a cold-blooded murder. Luke (Jonathan Scarfe) and Walter (John Corbett), Morrison's plans to run their family's trucking business are thwarted when the bodies of their parents and younger brother are discovered dead, lying in pools of their own blood.

As the facts fall into place, police are suspicious that one brother murdered them all. The other must make the decision to cooperate with authorities and provoke a confession.",1392595200,,605,5.302083333333333

3924924,5,B002GLG5OQ,"This was a predictable movie, but I enjoyed watching it.  I like John Corbett and feel he is one of the most underrated actors out there.  This is one of his earlier works about a family torn apart by a murder in the family.  I believe this was a Made for TV movie but I don't ever remember seeing it before.  I don't remember the story either, but I read about it online after I watched it.  The names were changed but the basic storyline seems accurate to the true crime that was committed.  Recommend for anyone who likes to watch true crime stories.",1375228800,,553,4.269230769230769

3924933,4,B002GLG5OQ,"This was a very interesting and well done movie of a true crime.  The Morrison brothers as played by John Corbett and Jonathan Scarfe, become involved in an unbelievable crime in order to inherit their parents' wealth and family business of trucking.  Their parents die suddenly in a mysterious fashion, which goes unsolved until detectives become suspicious of the actions of the younger Morrison son.  It seems that Luke is enjoying himself spending much of their inheritance before the case is solved.  Subsequently, Walter aids law enforcement by having conversations with his brother to uncover what he may be hiding.  These actors are perfect in portraying these 2 young men and make this tragic story come alive.  You are touched by Luke's seeming cold indifference to his parent's death and also by Walter's torment and conflicting emotions regarding his brother's actions.  John Corbett has already proved himself as an outstanding actor, but I think Jonathan Scarfe is on the same level, but just not recognized as such.

This ranks high as a true crime movie well worth seeing.",1363737600,6,1088,5.073033707865169

3924936,3,B002GLG5OQ,"Morrison Murders was a made for TV movie, based on an actual case in Georgia. It was your pretty standard made for TV movie, with one exception, the cast. Usually these things are pretty poorly written, predictable, and a little slow. This movie was far from slow, however a lot of the lines were cheesy and I figured out who did it within the first ten minutes. Sex & The City's John Corbett was very solid as was NYPD Blue's Gordon Clapp. It's nice to see people we associate with one character, stand out and be something completely different in another role. It's pretty much your standard, low budget, made for TV movie. The acting was a little better and the story moved along well, but it was toned down for the small screen and far too predictable for me.",1361577600,3,763,4.457142857142857

3924944,5,B002GLG5OQ,"I first saw this made-for-TV movie years ago, and am drawn to real crime stories. The actors that portrayed the brothers, one innocent, the other guilty, were so good in their respective roles, it sent chills up & down my spine watching the murderous brother act so casual after the horrific murders of his OWN Mom, Dad, and younger brother. John Corbett-since ""Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is one of my faves, the seemingly unknown, but equally talented actor who played his  brother(Jonathan Scarfe) was as handsome as he was strange in this role. The sets were very well done. Scenery was terrific, and the director never missed his mark. I didn't remember the title of this made for Television production, but found it surfing amazon/DVD/Movies. Lucky me! Now I have this hair-on-my-arm-raising movie in my collection! Loved this true crime drama/mystery & I highly recommend it! Mark-Hemet,Ca",1298678400,56,891,5.061224489795919
