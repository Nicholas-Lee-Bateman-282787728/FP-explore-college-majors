We instantly loved the bright costumes and colorful pointe shoes the doll like characters wore and tried the ballet steps they were demonstrating. Being the ballet lovers that we both are we were intrigued and wondered if and where we could see more! I carefully watched the credits and found it was a Canadian TV series and was available on video! Yipee!I was initially only going to get 1 video but found there was a whole set so I had to get them all for my little one! they teach dance steps, famous ballet stories, famous classical music pieces and life/social lessons as well. There are boy dancer characters to so boys can enjoy these also. You can also play the shows en Francais and learn french! There are fun cd rom games to play on them too. They are definitely one of my child's favorite series that shes loves to watch over and over, the kind of show you will remember into adulthood and i hope she will be able to share them with her little girl if she has one someday. I think most any little girl or boy into dance will love these videos! They are charming,non-violent, non offensive and classic!",1358812800,,1208,4.417040358744394
