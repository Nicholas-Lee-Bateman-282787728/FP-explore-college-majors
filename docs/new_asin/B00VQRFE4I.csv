7101080,3,B00VQRFE4I,Did not find the picture quality as good as the previous 1.2.3 seasons very disappointing. The fourth season really did not compair at all  to the previous seasons the quality of the season 4 stories seemed to distance the characters so far away from Blair General that it seemed at times you had to wonder where did Kildare go. Not the best writing compared to the wonderful stories produced in the previous seasons overall disappointing.,1436227200,,439,4.8533333333333335

7101083,5,B00VQRFE4I,"Thanks, so much, Warner Archive and Amazon for continuing to make this classic television drama available to hobby TV historians :)  I remember first seeing the three-part ""Rome Will Never Leave You"" way back when I was a kid.  It found safe harbor there for more than 40 years, and now I can re-live this fantastic complete fourth season from start to finish.  I highly recommend this series to those who are fans of great tv storytelling.

I agree with the above reviewer, who cannot wait for the serialised; and cliff-hanger rich Complete Fifth Season to come to dvd.  I have vivid recollection of the Fifth Season opener ""Behold, The Great Man"", guest starring James Mason and Margaret Leighton.  Mason portrays gifted surgeon ""Maxwell Becker, MD"" who appears before a Mortality and Morbidity conference to explain, through Kildare's direct questioning, the death of his patient on the operating table.  This was the episode that seeded in me a curiosity about the legal and ethical factors raised in Medicine and Healthcare, and which has led to a desire to seek out follow-up series such as ""St. Elsewhere""; ""Chicago Hope""; ""ER""; ""Monday Mornings""; and the upcoming and much anticipated CBS drama ""Code Black"".

Edit - Great News from very respected website - [...]  Both Dr. Kildare - The Complete Fifth (and Final) Season; and Medical Center - The Complete Sixth Season are in the works at Warner Archive Collection as I send this message.  This is sensational news for fans of these two classic medical dramas.",1433635200,2,1519,4.94488188976378
7101084,5,B00VQRFE4I,"Another great season of nostalgia with Richard Chamberlain as Dr. Kildare!  As with the other 3 seasons previously released, the video and sound quality are exceptional. Just a note: the DVD covers state that there are 34 episodes but there were only 32 made that season, and 32 is what you get with this 8 disc 4th season set. Aside from a few sillier episodes [the season starts right off with a couple] that I never really enjoyed back in the 60's, or now, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of this set. Can't wait for the release of the 5th and final season, with its shift to half-hour episodes and cliff-hangers that tried to compete with the twice-weekly style of Peyton Place & Batman at the time, after which it went off the air :(",1433462400,2,736,4.451851851851852
7101085,5,B00VQRFE4I,"Another great season of Dr. Kildare! I really hope the 5th and final season makes it to DVD soon.  I'm almost halfway through viewing this season's episodes now.  I didn't really enjoy the 3-part ""Rome Will Never Leave You"" episodes that are more soap opera than medical drama (they feature love stories for both doctors Kildare and Gillespie (!), and Chamberlain sings the title song (Bacharach/David) a few times), but this season has otherwise been pretty good so far.

However, I did find what appears to be a disk mastering problem on disk 3, and I'm wondering if others have this same problem.  The episode titled ""Catch a Crooked Mouse"" has a length of about 37 minutes rather than the 50-51 minute timings on every other episode.  When I watched this episode, the end credits suddenly began to play after one of the last act breaks.  I was pretty upset to think I'd never be able to know Kildare's very important decision in this story, but then I decided to try this episode by choosing the ""Play All"" option on the disk menu, and the full episode played after I skipped 21 chapters to get to this episode.

The disks in my Kildare season 4 set were NOT burned on demand, they are normal DVDs with silver backing rather than the bluish backing on MOD disks.  I was very surprised that I hadn't heard about this ""short"" episode problem online before I discovered the problem.",1433462400,12,1383,4.616326530612245

7101087,5,B00VQRFE4I,"Thank you so much. I love this dvd set of the fourth season of Dr. Kildare. This was a great series in the 60's and is still great now. If Richard Chamberlain is in it, you know it will always be extremely entertaining and well done every time. Keep putting his work out there for everyone to enjoy.",1432944000,4,299,4.172413793103448

8710947,5,B00VQRFE4I,"Finding out earlier this year that my beloved Dr. Kildare TV series was on DVD was a life-changer! Seriously -- I have been watching and binging on it for months now, and with 191 episodes total (in all five seasons), that is a lot of watching and binging! I haven't watched current TV for years, so this is really unusual for me. I am not sure I would recommend the series to anyone who didn't see it originally, or who didn't have a crush on Jim Kildare. It is quite dated in production values and hardly realistic, and OMG did women really wear those clothes and fussy hairdos and did men OD on Brylcream?  Cigarettes everywhere, even the doctors, even in the hospital rooms. Wow. But for almost every episode there is a memory for me beyond the cultural, something that is thrilling because it returns to me so vividly. It is not usually a plot point but rather an image, maybe a character's facial mole, or a particular garment, maybe a joke by Dr. Kildare, or words of wisdom from Dr. Gillespie, or a particular scene. Hey, I remember this! Suddenly I am a teenage girl watching the same episode. I distinctly remember how Dr. Kildare's direct gaze, honesty, kindness, courage to confront, and dedication to doing what was right, all inspired me to look for the same traits in myself and others. I must admit, that though I had a crush on Dr. Kildare those 50-some years ago, my crush this time is on Dr. Gillespie. Has any TV character ever been so wise or compassionate? I think not. And the reason I have chosen to write this review for the Fourth Season as opposed to the others, though they all have had me mesmerized, is that this season contains, for me, the best three minutes of the whole five seasons. The episode called ""Music Hath Charms"" (first episode on Disc Eight) is quite different from most episodes. It is mostly lighthearted, almost slapstick, as Dr. Kildare tries to produce a hospital talent show. Dr. Gillespie has been goaded by a dear friend into singing a song for it. Just before he goes on, he learns that this friend has unexpectedly and inexplicably died. He goes on anyway and the scene that follows is as poignant and moving as anything ever filmed. It solidified my love of this character. If for no other reason, buy this season for this one scene! (And in a later episode this season is the worst acting I have ever seen. Worth seeing for the incredulity. Honestly, I thought this gal was going to be diagnosed with a neurological disorder, she was so jerky, but no ...) This show is easy to watch, no commercial interruptions, no rapid-fire conversations that move the plot along, always a serious point and a worthwhile moral. Classic TV at its best.",1494547200,,2694,4.566115702479339

8710953,5,B00VQRFE4I,"A truly fantastic DVD collection! After purchasing the first 4 seasons of this classic show, I have found myself fully immersed in the stories of the patients and staff at Blair General Hospital. This season has many memorable episodes, with a few venturing from the norm, balancing it's familiar drama with a few added touches of music and humor, as Jim Kildare completes his second year of residency. Richard Chamberlain is as handsome as ever, with his acting, I believe, becoming much more polished with each season. One particular scene in mention is his heartfelt monologue at the end of the episode ""Please Let My Baby Live,"" which is among my favorites from the set. The picture quality for every episode is outstanding as always, though I noticed that the audio quality for this set is far superior to the previous seasons. Well done!

I want to express my sincere thanks to Warner Archive for remastering and releasing this unforgettable series. In turn, introducing it to classic TV lovers of new generations, like me: a 24-year old fan of 1960's television, who otherwise may not have seen it in it's entirety (if at all), had it not been for these releases! I am very excited to complete my collection with season 5!!!",1441670400,,1231,4.806603773584905
8710954,5,B00VQRFE4I,"This is such a great series! I've ordered 3 seasons, so far. My husband generally doesn't like old shows but he loves this one. It's a hospital series set in the 60's and it is interesting to see how medical practices and equipment have changed over the years. It doesn't always end on a happy note but it's a relaxing show to watch.",1441670400,,333,4.301587301587301
