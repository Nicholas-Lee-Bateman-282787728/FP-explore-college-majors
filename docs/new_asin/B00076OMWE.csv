8045033,4,B00076OMWE,"The Las Vegas Serial Killer is the story of a convicted killer released from a Nevada prison by mistake. He then goes on a female killing spree reminiscent of what he did 7 years earlier in Hollywood Strangler meets the Skid Row Slasher. In fact, the style of the movie is almost a carbon-copy with Jonathan Klick(the killer) going around staring at women with a sleazy, creepy look then proceeds to photograph them in the nude(how this weird-looking old geezer is able to get women to disrobe and pose for him is beyond me) in some living room or den(how does he have access to this?).

In addition to Klick, there's also two other losers going around gawking at women and commiting various street crimes. They seem to have nothing to do with Klick except to add to the weirdness of this flick. The audio comprises of overdubbed voices and music. I read somewhere that this movie was shot without audio(silent movie in 1986?). Now back in the mid-80's I vacationed often in Vegas with my family and this movie, being shot entirely on location, is like a time-capsule of a bygone era. All the sleaziness and old-style casinos I remembered as a youth, is presevered here perfectly.

In addition to the main feature, there is a good deal of extra features included in this DVD. There is an interview with Ray Dennis Steckler that runs about 9mins. He mainly discusses about the business aspects of distributing movies back in the drive-in era. There is also a commentary track with Steckler in which he gives plenty of background info on the actors and various scenes. Interesting. There's two short films that is just as bizzare as the main feature. The first one is called Face of Evil(1hr4min). A demented-looking fat man drives around sleazy Los Angeles making perverted facial expressions while gawking at women. He then proceeds to kill a few.

The second film is called Slashed(31min). This one also takes place in Las Vegas so you get more of the old Sin City. Basically random shots of street scenes and then inserted footage of Klick photographing his victims and a motorcycle guy going around town causing havoc. Lastly, you get 7 trailers of demented movies including Rat Fink & Boo, The Lemon Grove Kids, Incredibly Strange Creatures, Thrill Killers, Blood Shack, Hollywood Strangler meets the Skid Row Slasher, and Body Fever. No doubt this DVD is for a select audience only. This is a good package with plenty of extra materials for fans of Steckler flicks.",1286150400,4,2470,4.779859484777518
8045034,5,B00076OMWE,"Let's start out by saying, if you're not a fan of low grade cinema, start runnin'. This film is only for those of bad cinema and Steckler fans. Like 'The Thrill Killers', this film focuses on some bad guys that really have nothing to do with one another. However these guys to tend to cross paths unknowlingly with each other. That's one of the best qualities of this film. The music is quite haunting and reminiscent of the score from William Lustig's 'Maniac'. If you want a sleazy, cheezy, slow paced film to end your day, look no further!",1265328000,,542,4.484848484848484
