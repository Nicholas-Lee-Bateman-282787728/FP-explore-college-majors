It's not my own favourite preschool show but I'm happy to give 5 stars to this collection because it has a nice variety of episodes and good value for money as far as run-time to cost ratio.
As noted in other reviews, and in the product information, this particular set will not play on a standard U.S. DVD players, X-boxes, Blu-Ray players, etc. It was published for European/Region 2 playback devices. Make sure you know what a region code is and whether you have a way around it (a region-free device or other solution) before purchasing this for use outside of Region 2. (Amazon does generally post warnings for media with this problem, but it's easy to overlook them.)",1465257600,4,812,4.685314685314685
