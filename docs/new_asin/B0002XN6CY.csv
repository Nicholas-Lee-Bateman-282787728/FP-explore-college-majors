Which Way, Freeway?

(Air date: January 29,1980)

Although most reference books list only three regulars for the 1979-84 mystery series Hart to Hart (Robert Wagner, Stefanie Powers and Lionel Slander), there actually was a fourth member of the prime-time team: the Harts' dog, Freeway. Mystery writer Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles had Asta; Jonathan and Jennifer Hart had Freeway, the cute canine figuring prominently in several of their crime capers. This first-season episode opens with the Harts getting dressed for a benefit costume party that will raise money for an animal shelter. Max is concerned about Freeway because ""the dog is eating like a bird."" Love must be the answer. Max doesn't know the object of Freeway's affections, but he thinks she's a local girl. She is, and the romance puts our Rover Romeo on the scene of a homicide. The dogged member of the Hart household not only witnesses the killing, he makes off with the murder weapon.

Murder Is Man's Best Friend

(Air date: January 9,1980)

This second-season episode also puts Freeway in the way of danger. While walking the pampered pooch, Max is approached by an advertising executive who wants to use the Harts' pet in a TV commercial for dog food. Veteran comic actor Kenneth Mars appears as an evil doctor experimenting with drugged food that will be marketed to humans. Mars, one of Mel Brooks'favorite performers, had already played playwright Franz Liebkin in The Producers (1968) and Inspector Kemp in Young Frankenstein (1974). Martine Beswick, whose films include the James Bond movies From Russia with Love and Thunderbolt, appears as the doctor's assistant, a former wrestler. Freeway becomes a kidnapped canine as the killer finds himself dogged by the Harts.
