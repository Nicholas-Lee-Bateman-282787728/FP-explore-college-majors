6854486,2,B00Q5995LU,"my kids and I are long time fans of Veggies. I didn't like new animation or the fact the  movie was based on a very whiny Shem. My kids were freaked out by Madame Blueberries new look and voice, she was their fav. The music is boring even Silly Song. MY 2 yr old screams ""No!"" when her older sister teases her about watching it. We were sad and dissapointed. If is the new Veggies we are out and Im not wasting my money.",1425600000,37,420,4.0
6854487,5,B00Q5995LU,"I'm a longtime fan of Veggietales.  Funny enough, I was introduced to Veggietales in college when a friend suggested I watch them because I was feeling far from God.  This was back in 1997.  I've been through many permutations of the Veggie-verse (get it?  Veggietales and universe...Veggie-verse!) watching Big Idea grow and technology change and through the ups and downs of corporate craziness.  I even spent several years as a Veggie ambassador, getting advanced copies of the videos and helping promote them.

It blows my mind that 22 years after the first video was made, through all the ups and down of the company and all the technological changes we've seen, Veggietales is still on message and delivering quality entertainment for the family.  Their new release, Noah's Ark:  A Lesson in Trusting God, is no exception.  Through a version of the Noah's Ark story that relies a bit on poetic license, we see that following God doesn't always make sense and that His plans for us are not always the same as our plans for us, but if we trust God and does what He tells us, His plans always turn out better.  I think this message is especially relevant for today's kids (and adults) because God's ways are sounding stranger and stranger to those who don't follow Him and we need to hear that it is okay for people to think that.  We should follow God's directions anyway.

There are the usual Veggietales songs and silliness, but one thing has changed in this DVD.  The Veggies have eye color!!!  I've seen a lot of visual changes throughout Veggietales' history and this was the most drastic by far.  At first, I did not like it at all.  I felt like it gave the characters a very pre-schoolish feeling.  One of the things I like about Veggietales is that my 8 and 10 year old children like them and I was afraid they would be put off by the new visuals, perhaps feeling like Veggietales was now for ""babies"".  By the end of the video, though, I was used to it and the counter scene at the end was not nearly as jarring as the counter scene at the beginning.  I still don't know if I like the visual change, but I'm used to it.

Overall, I recommend this movie to any family with elementary aged children or younger.  I'll even throw this out there...I had a blast in college being a Veggie Ambassador and throwing parties in my dorm room where we ordered pizza and had Veggietales marathons.  Maybe me and my nerdy marching band friends were the only college students ever who would think that was a good way to spend a Saturday night, but it was a blast!

I was provided this DVD free of charge in return for my honest review.",1425340800,6,2633,4.508438818565401
6854488,2,B00Q5995LU,"Let me start off by saying that I love VeggieTales, well, I used to until the recent changes. I decided to give the new VeggieTales look a chance since it is geared toward kids. I watched the new VeggieTales: Noahs Ark movie, trying to overlook my personal feelings and I was completely shocked and discouraged by the drastic change, not of the looks of the characters, but the content of the movie.

Watching this movie on the surface and not wanting Biblical accuracy, I would probably give this movie a four star rating. From this perspective, it was a pretty cute movie with clean humor and a good story.

As a loyal VeggieTales lover who wants kids to learn Bible lessons from their favorite VeggieTales characters, I have to give this a two star ratingthey failed miserably.

The movie stated off okay, I felt many of the songs were lacking excitement and fun. Yes, they had some point to them, but they were missing that I want to buy this VeggieTales song and play it in the car feel.

I understand this is a kids movie and they were trying to make it understandable for kids. I also understand there is some liberty for imagination when creating a VeggieTales movie. That said, I think when you are taking one and presenting it as ""the story of Noah,"" I have to be more cautious as many kids learn from VeggieTales and I want them to learn the true story.

Before Bob and Larry started the Noah part of the movie when they were sitting on the countertop, as is typical with VeggieTales, Larry made the comment to Bob that he had an imagination. I understand this, but I did not feel it was clearly stated to kids that the story was really going to be imagined and that a good bit of the movie was not going to be accurate.

Okay, so here is a list of what I noticed:

-Shem gets married and they give his wife a name, I can let this slide, but here is where the issue came in for me. Shem is returning from his honeymoon and when he gets home the ark is mostly built and he freaks out. So either Shem had a super long honeymoon or Noah built the entire ark in a couple weeks. Neither option represent the Biblical picture for me.
-The ark is shaped like an orange slice, I can let this one go as well, but for those who really want a good portrait of the ark, this could be a concern.
-The ark is presented like a giant cruise ship with a water slide and Noah and his family wearing outfits that you would expect employees on a cruise ship to be wearing. They talk about welcoming the animals (passengers) aboard.
-While the doors to the ark open and close, nothing was mentioned about God doing this. I think this is such a critical part of the story as it really shows Gods hand in it.
-Shem was mad about being on the ark and tried to leave. I had mixed feelings on this. I didn't care for it because it isn't presented in the Bible this way, but at the same time, I liked how it opened up to teach about trusting God and His plans.
-There wasn't a lot explaining why there was going to be a flood or anyone else mocking Noah.
-This is minor, but Shem in his plan to try to get everyone off of the ark before Gods timing sends a hamster on a hot air balloon ride. The hamster never comes back until the very end of the movie, which is 6 or more months. The fact that God brought the animals in pairs is such a critical part of the story and I felt this was really stretching things.

I cant fail to mention that the eyes of Madem Blueberry, Bob, and Larry did bother me. They looked really weird and I didn't care for their new look. Some of the characters didn't bother me that much, but these three really stood out to me.

Im not going to give up on VeggieTales just yet. As much as I hate saying this, I think they need to stay away from doing direct Bible stories and focus on doing stories like they did in the past with a Biblical message.

*I received a free copy of this movie to facilitate this review.",1425168000,64,3924,4.213049267643142
6854489,1,B00Q5995LU,"My family and I are concerned about the new direction of Big Idea. We've been avid Veggie-Fans since their beginnings.

We just purchased Noah's Ark tonight from the Family Christian Bookstore. Up until now, we were very happy, excited, and anxiously anticipated the next new release. I must say, what a complete letdown!

Bob, Larry, and Pa Grape look different and weird, to the point that it scared our children. Our 8 year-old son said ""I don't think I want to watch this, I'm going to watch Charlie Brown instead.""

Lastly, this is not your typical Veggie-Production. The music is boring and lacks energy. Big Idea made a very bad decision with this one. If this is their new direction, then they just lost four customers. Save your money and wait to see it for free on TBN.",1425168000,96,779,4.630434782608695
6854490,4,B00Q5995LU,"I was glad to see the Veggietales return to telling a Bible story more like their original videos.
Of course it's not an exact retelling, but it is typical of their storytelling style. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the updated appearance. It's not a hit with me or my kids, but they've gotten over it rather quickly.",1514332800,,340,4.328125

6854502,2,B00Q5995LU,"So now my daughter thinks that there were hot air balloons in Noah's time.  This story is so far off of the Bible story that it's messed with my daughter's understanding of history and inventions...  It's one thing to be a bit artistic and creative in a retelling of story, but this is over the top messed up.  I've never seen an accurate version of Noah's story for children anyways, so I didn't have high expectations, especially considering Noah's a pea.  However, this is so grossly exaggerated that I cringe when my daughter refers to it.  We've had many discussions about what things were and were not invented at that time, what is and is not Biblical, and what culture was like back then but she still thinks the movie is right and I am wrong.  Maybe it's a better movie for 4th or 5th graders as they can compare and contrast it to the real Bible story, but then again, kids that old aren't always interested in VeggieTales.  Just keep in mind that the more a child is exposed to incorrect info, the negative transfer will effect them even if we as parents don't think it will.  I challenge parents to actually read the account of Noah straight from Genesis and then preview the movie.",1489622400,4,1194,4.49537037037037

6854524,4,B00Q5995LU,This is not a bad movie at all.  It's not a favorite but we do watch it quite often.  It's more suited to the toddler crowd and I have a 10 year old.  It takes an 'inside look' at Noah and his family so that's a bit interesting because even in the Bible you don't get that much detail.  But I love the way they delve into the individual characters.  The movie really centers around one of Noah's sons who happens to be on his way back home from his honeymoon to find that his dad has taken over the location of where his new house is to be built in order to build an ark.  The entire movie is spent trying to get the son to understand that it's all working out according to God's plan.  Excellent movie!  Too cute!,1464998400,,714,4.01418439716312

6854527,1,B00Q5995LU,"I'm a big Veggie Tales fan from early on. I've always found the writing and music to be smart and amusing. all the jokes and references were great. Then something happened. The scripts started to feel like they were written by a committee. The religious messages got kinda muddy. everything feels dummed down and bland.
There is not a single word in the script or song that is memorable. My kids watched this episode in shock. What happened?
I long for the days of Ester, or Dr Jiggles.
Oh, and the new way the characters are drawn... all wrong, all wrong. Larry has jaundice eyes. They all look like bath toys.

It's all so,so wrong. Goodbye Veggie Tales. I guess nothing can last forever.

And of course, as I've already mentioned, the animation is just horrible.  I read somewhere they were tying to ""update"" the characters - but this is NOT an update.

6854579,1,B00Q5995LU,"Its hard for me to write this review.  Ive long been a fan of VeggieTales, and I love the story of Noahs Ark, so a combination of the two should be a home run, right?  Sadly, thats not the case with this DVD release.

In answer to a letter to a boy who was hoping for a baby brother but got a baby sister instead, Larry the Cucumber has decided that they should tell the story of Noahs Ark.  After all, it shows the importance of trusting God over our own plans.

This retelling of the story focuses on Noahs son Shem (voiced by special guest Wayne Brady).  Hes just returned from his honeymoon and is making all kinds of plans for the house he intends to build for his new wife.  However, when he arrives home, he finds the rest of his family building a giant boat in the exact spot where he wanted to build his house.  Even crazier, animals start to show up two by two.  Will his plans for his new life ever happen?

So what went wrong?  Where to even start.  Shem spends the entire video trying to get out of the ark, be it before the rain starts or after the rain has finally stopped.  I get that it was designed to build some kind of plot, however that really bothered me.  Okay, so Im not the most flexible person in the world, and maybe it was hitting too close to home, but the lack of faith that Shem showed for most of the video really bothered me  especially since no one else was questioning what God told them at all.  Were talking to the point of trying to rappel out of the ark right before the rain starts.  It just seems out of character for anyone in the story.

Maybe my problem with this change is that they use Shem to preach the moral, so instead of feeling natural or entertaining, they have no purpose with it but to drive their point home.  If its forced on us and the story, it won't work as entertainment.

Couple that will a complete lack of humor.  It used to be that these shows had jokes adults and kids would like  sometimes they would even both laugh at the same joke.  Jokes for either age are nowhere to be found here.  I laughed once or twice, but that was it in the 50 minute video.

Then theres the music.  As in there is too much of it.  With seven new songs, theres too much time spent singing, slowing down the story.  (Wait, maybe thats a good thing since how they told the story failed so miserably.)  The songs were just okay at best  none are memorable enough to make me wish I had them and a couple get repetitive very quickly.

Sadly, that applies to the new Silly Song.  My Golden Egg follows Larry as he searches for a special golden egg during an Easter Egg hunt.  Theres really nothing silly or fun about it.

The animation continues to be fine for the series.  This isn't big budget animation, but it works.  The voices are fun like always as well.  Many people are commenting on the new look of the characters, to the point that this new look is scaring their kids.  Honestly, I thought Pa Grape and Madame Blueberry (Mr. and Mrs. Noah) seemed a little off, but I really didn't nothing anything major.

And I do get the point they were trying to make about Gods plans always being the best.  Its an important lesson and one I often need to be reminded of myself.  However, this story doesnt serve that purpose at all.

I am actually okay with some of the changes they made to the Noah story.  The ark looks like a giant orange, they really, really (really) compress the time it took to rebuild the ark.  And we don't see anyone mocking Noah for it.  That last one would introduce death into VeggieTales, and I think given the audience they were right to leave it out. They do mention why God is bringing the flood after all.  Even the sea serpent wasn't a bad thing (although it felt forced just to add humor when it wasn't as funny as they wanted it to be).  They have never stuck faithfully to the Biblical story, so all of these changes alone wouldnt have bothered me.  However, the humor and fun they intend to have with these changes just doesnt work.  At all.  And, again, the way they present Shem to force home the moral just doesnt work for the story they are trying to tell at all.

Even when I don't love a VeggieTales episode, I can usually find something worthwhile in it.  In this case, there is no reason to watch Noahs Ark.  Skip it and rewatch some of the older, better Bible stories theyve done instead.",1435104000,4,4374,4.238787878787879

6854582,1,B00Q5995LU,"I have been a huge fan of Veggie Tales since I was little, but I was horrified to find their new adventures are not even close to biblical accounts. When the new Show Veggies in the House Came out I simply dismissed it hoping the individual movies would remain the same. I had no Idea they were under a new producer.
This is nothing I would want my Children to watch. As impressional beings the will more than likely come way thinking what Veggie Tales says actually happened. The last thing I want my kids to do is question what is in the bible.
Here is just a few of the errors.
1. If Shem would have had an attitude he would not have made it on the boat.
2. The Ark is a picture of how Jesus death on the cross saves the lost. If the Ark had sprung a leak it would mean that what Jesus did is not enough for Salvation.
3. There was only one window and one door. Once the door was shut no one got in and No one got OUT.
There were so  many errors I could not name them all but I was sick all the way through the movie, and even my Five year old nephew was yelling at the screen saying, ""That didn't happen."" but when he watched it the second time he was doubting what was really in scripture.

6854589,3,B00Q5995LU,"Our family owns every dvd Veggie Tales has put out (& some old VHS tapes)  I have done many reviews for VeggieTales.  When we first saw the changes coming we were not very happy about it but we wanted to give it a fair chance.  The kids were not very happy at the first scene.  (The eldest said they thought it looked like the Veggies were on drugs)  Though the opening counter scene has the typical Veggie comedy.  This video is more of a musical....ah, vegical?  Anyway, there are A LOT of songs.  Most of them are pretty good, not the best Veggie Tales has put out but still ok.  The typical nods to past VeggieTales videos are there though the new animation style may make you look twice to recognize it.  The story line was ok, like the music not the worst but not the best.  Wayne Brady did a great job voicing the veggie.
Of course, like most of their dedicated fans, we noticed the change in the ""message""  When Phil lost control of the company (I highly suggest reading Me, Myself & Bob to find out how & why)  I know many of us were worried about the direction that Big Ideas would be lead in. I feared that the message would go to be a good kid just because.  For a few videos, our worries were lessened.  This one has a message but frankly it kind of fell short of the typical Veggie Tale videos.  Its not that bad but just not great like past videos.  If this is your first exposure to Veggie Tales, skip this and get The League of Incredible Vegetables, A Snoodles Tale, Beauty And The Beet, Larry Boy or any of the Minnesota Cuke tales.  For those of you who have all the videos like us, I would add this to  your collection.

There were no slushies in the desert; there were no rubber duckies.

6854611,5,B00Q5995LU,"Hey, I love this! I know most and some of you hate the new design and are wishing for the old design back, but according to Phil Vischer, they redesigned them because of the riggings on models they used since 2000 and want to continue on with something fresh. He stated that how regardless the designs are, he likes them at the same time. And so do I! When I heard and saw about ""VeggieTales in The House,"" streaming on Netflix, I was unsure at first about their new look, since I like the old look as much as you do. But in life for the 20th and 21st century, stuff's gotta change. Me, I like a little change, but dislike a lot of change. I'm born autistic, and that's part of becoming mature. Since I caught up with 3 episodes of it on Netflix, I'm starting to like both designs. Which still makes VeggieTales very cool! If you want the old design back, deal with the old stories. You can't reason it with Phil, because like this video just said, God's got plans and he'll work it out even when his plans don't match your own. And that's how it was for Phil. Guest stars Wayne Brady and Jaci were fabulous. I'm 20 years old now but VeggieTales is kept in mind! Ever since harsh middle school, that's where they came in perfectly! Autistically perfect!

Think about what Mickey Mouse looked like in Steam Boat Willy, Fantasia, or the cartoons from the 50's and 60's compared to Mickey Mouse club house.

Our family first saw these new characters in ""Veggie Tales in the House"" which is purely a Netflix production. We noticed the Netflix production didn't involve Phil Vischer and stated in bold print at the outset that it was ""Based on the Characters of Veggie Tales."" Our children watched a few episodes and really liked them, but neither me nor my husband felt like we wanted our kids watching the show. Reason being, the characters are wild and out of control, act and look like they're on drugs, and their personalities have completely changed from the personalities we've come to know and appreciate (in a negative way, in our opinion).

Though each episode focuses on a moral lesson, the lesson is only one that pertains to outward behavior. The characters personalities are super-carnal and throughout each episode behave like they have un-regenerated hearts, then at the end they learn that they have to ""behave"" better outwardly, but not have an inward change. In the old VeggieTales cartoons the characters went through what was akin to repentance. (I know they're cartoon characters, but they display human qualities and model behavior for our children. The history this show has of bringing the characters to a place of reconciliation with God in various ways is what draws Christians like me.) The new model brings the characters through an outward change, but no true reflection on the nature of their sin takes place; a Pharisee-like, cleansing of the outside of the cup. I'm concerned the new direction of VeggieTales reflects the new writers' idea of repentance, which is troubling; ""out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks"" (Matt 12:34).

Sure these are just cartoons, but for Christians trying to be careful about what we put in front of our children's eyes, it's disappointing to have a trusted group change direction with a good product. Trying to train a child up in the way he should go includes taking care about what personalities and behaviors are being portrayed in the shows the child watches. These new characters are out of sync with our family, so when we purchased the Noah movie and found that the characters were the Veggies In The House characters we were disappointed. We don't let our kids watch Veggies In The House for the reasons stated above, so we are really disappointed that the Veggies in the House characters made their way into VeggieTales movies and we are extremely disappointed in those who hold the rights to VeggiTales for taking a divergent direction with a successful Christian product.",1425859200,37,2829,5.0405982905982905
6854625,1,B00Q5995LU,"Veggie Tales Noahs Ark DVD gets two thumbs down. It was a tremendous disappointment and we were already braced for the difference in the characters appearance. We had seen one show on Netflix and thought it was a bad change and that opinion was confirmed when we saw the DVD. My husband and I have seen every production and have enjoyed every one up until now. This may spell the end of our new veggie Tale purchases.

Here are a couple of reasons why we disliked the show:

The look (and sound) of the characters is really weird.
The story is a true account of something that happened and we understand that to explain things to children requires some license but this was riddled with inaccuracies.
 An orange shaped ark?
 The possibility that the ark might flip over?
 A deck on the ark?
 A depiction of Shem as a whiney, selfish kid?
 Leaks in the ark?

If we are using something to teach children it is important to give them information that is useful and won't confuse them or give them reason to think the true accounts in Genesis are fables. There was more fabrication on the part of the writers as well. Ideas such as the squid and the hot air balloon could have been useful (maybe) but they were handled badly. There was also too much uninteresting music.

This is not a good DVD for adults and certainly not for children. I won't be wasting my  money on future purchases unless the real Bob and Larry return with excellent stories sprinkled with humorous illusions that were once created for us.",1425772800,6,1507,4.507352941176471
6854626,2,B00Q5995LU,"Disappointing. The story was good, but if you have been watching Veggietales for the past decade with your kids you will barely recognize what it has become. The animation is weak, some of the voices are different and the songs were different, as in not as good. The silliness that Veggietales is known for is hardly evident. Watching the credits at the end you get the feeling that Phil, Mike and Kurts involvement is just a token nod to and era that is past. Sadly if the next one that is produced is done in the same fashion, Noah will be the last one we buy. Veggietales has always been a part of our lives and it may be that the older productions will be the only ones that will hold that place.",1425686400,15,700,4.2706766917293235
6854627,2,B00Q5995LU,"Our family has loved veggie tales, but why the new faces on the characters, it was weird.  Also the script didn't seem 100% true to veggie tales too. I liked the old way veggie tales were done better.",1425600000,5,200,4.2631578947368425
6854628,1,B00Q5995LU,"I understand changing with the times and technology; however, Big Idea has gone to the negative extreme. My four year old (who loves veggietales) cries and is afraid of the new look. I have to put in Where is God When I'm Scarred to remind her that God is bigger than these new VeggieTales characters. Not only is the new look lacking, most importantly, so is the content. Just because you make something shiny and different doesn't mean we aren't going to notice when quality diminishes. I'd recommend passing on this incantation, and hope Big Idea sees the big picture and returns our beloved veggies to us.",1425600000,33,609,4.700934579439252
6854629,5,B00Q5995LU,Okay yes the look is different.  BUT it is still the same VeggieTales!  Still great Christian based children's stories. The same as it has always been. Yes they have taken a few liberties with the story line but they have always done that. They weren't exactly throwing Slushies at Joshua in real life. Over all the is a great story that teaches kids to trust God even when its hard.,1425600000,,383,4.457142857142857
