3695342,4,B001MBTSK4,"The scene is set.  It is 1968.  The Vietnam War is at its zenith.  Hippies proliferate. Why are they here and what do they want and will they take over the land or die out like dinosaurs? Arch conservative William F. Buckley Jr. is hosting - ringmastering is more like it! - a fifty minute interview with some serious competition for the Three Stooges.  Buckley, at his smarmy best, uncoils like a well-suited sleepy snake and actually tongue-stumbles probably on devious purpose and gets by in introducing King of the Beats Jack Kerouac as ""Jerk..Jack Kerouac.""  You have to hear it to believe it.  It is NO slip.  Silver-tongued Buckley is too shrewd to ever slip - unless it was because of the fork in his tongue.  Kerouac is King of the Boozers during this panel...I was going to say ""discussion"" but it really cannot be termed as such.  The whole fifty minutes seems more like sitting around the diner after a night on the town with a few friends and drinking coffee to end an exhaustive evening out. Buckley is akin to the diner owner who has a break and decides to  rest his dogs and join and moderate his customers in their booth of bleary, late-night b.s.-ing.  Kerouac seems to be asleep through great parts of the long fifty minutes - but he surprises us and will suddenly awaken and respond to something you might think had gone right by him.  He is only 46 and will be dead not long after this appearance.  He is 46 but looks 66. He is sad - but funny - like all the great clowns he is lost in a sea of sadness and no lifeboat can ever reach him.  But he gets many hearty laughs from the audience, as do the saddest and best clowns.  Lifelong friend and advocate for Kerouac's spontaneous prose when to publish Kerouac was like welcoming the plague, Allen Ginsberg is glimpsed once in the audience watching his great friend linguistically lumber about like a circus bear that Buckley tries to control with the loosest collar and chain.  Kerouac informs all that he was arrested two weeks prior - and  the policeman charged him with ""Decay.""  It gets a big laugh.  I laughed.  And then I felt like crying, knowing as I did that a brilliant, beautiful man would not only soon be gone...but already was, as is evident in this precious DVD, and for some long time before.  The unopened whiskey bottle and can of beer I saw on his grave in Lowell when I went to say a prayer for a Catholic boy who ran faster than most - he was a great football running back in his youth, afterall - unlike Rocky Sullivan a.k.a. James Cagney who didn't run fast enough from the clutches of the law in ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and that adolescent lack of speed led him to the long walk to old sparky - but I guess no matter how fast or slow we run we all do our time on death row and all get zapped in the last reel - well, the booze for Kerouac was placed by the well-meaning to honor the man who spent his life in a deadly and dire desire waiting for God to show His face - and now, body forever sealed in the deep dark Earth, I wondered and hoped he finally had seen it - and that it was a good and loving face at last - but I knew that all honor aside, the fire in the bottle, in a short lifetime of thousands of them had caused the smoke that choked the heartbeat out of Ti Jean just the same. Well and all, I thought as I stood from the small grave containing so much largeness, he was at last off the wheel of the quivering meat conception and...safe in Heaven, dead.  Adios, King.

Back to Buckley. Next to Jack is one Lewis Yablonsky, straight-laced scholar of the Hippie movement and  perhaps the third,long edited out part of the once fabulous and now mostly forgotten Bob and Ray comedy team.  One thing is for sure, Yablonsky is straight out of the Slow Talkers of America - an organization that Bob and Ray brought to such hilarious light and life in their comedy.  I still don't know what Lewis Yablonsky really felt about the once colossal and now whimsical and amusing movement known as the Hippies (and their offshoot the Yippies.)  He talks slow and sure and says a lot - but even without being drunk as was Kerouac, I was hard-pressed to stop from snoozing whenever he opened his mouth and yawn-talked whatever.

Ed Sanders of the Fugs is the last element of this oddball trio.  He is also the most articulate - and I read on wikipedia that he is still with us and living in Woodstock, NY.  Watching this DVD, because of the immediacy that comes from its taped-as-if-today quality, it seems to conquer Time and leap the decades.  Yet in another sense - because the Hippies have gone the way of the dinosaurs - one feels like they are watching an episode filmed in another dimension, on another world.  A filmed acid trip perhaps.

Towards the end of the eternal fifty minutes a fresh-faced young blonde teen condescendingly asks Ed Sanders if he thinks he will still be a Fug when he is fifty.  Well, by my count of his years he is now 72 and if not a Fug by name he is still very much with IT. God bless him! I wonder whatever happened to that young teenage girl who tried so hard to impress her evident god William F. Buckley Jr. with her too-old for her years smarmy arch-conservative question, asked  that long ago, all-but-lost night of September 3,1968. Oh, the good old days!  Time travel and enjoy it all in your livingroom with this priceless yet so affordable DVD.  And ponder - as did Kerouac - was the Vietnam War a conspirary twixt the North and South Vietnamese to get jeeps into their country?",1320624000,11,5517,4.357771260997067
3695343,5,B001MBTSK4,"This early, color episode of Firing Line, dedicated to the topic ""hippies,"" is one of the odder things I've seen.  I'd never had exposure to Jack Kerouac before, and had never heard of Ed Sanders.  Sanders is an articulate man, Yablonski a sociologist, and Kerouac a wacked-out something or other.  Although Buckley starts out the program in his typical analytic fashion, trying to establish common terms for debate, the program never really goes anywhere.  Yablonski tries to answer questions from his research experience, while Sanders pushes his own ""peace"" agenda, and Kerouac is either stoned or drunk.  Who hippies are is never quite pinned down, not to mention any other questions, such as the future of American society under their influence.  Instead we get sort of a farce of Firing Line, and I wouldn't be surprised if Buckley intended this, letting Americans see Sanders and Kerouac for themselves rather than characterizing them second-hand.  Kerouac won't either be quiet or engage sensibly (not to mention articulately), and ends up dominating the conversation.  The audience responds positively to Kerouac, and the episode sounds as though it is filmed with a laugh track rather than a live studio audience.  Sanders and Yablonski respond to this in turn, and all are getting sillier and failing to take Kerouac seriously as the episode goes on.  If anything, Kerouac reminds me of an Saturday Night Live comedian in his ridiculous non-sequitur answers.  He makes noises while the other guests are talking, and having Jack Kerouac shushed by William F. Buckley like a mother would shush a child has to be one of the great moments in TV.  Enjoyable and interesting.  Recommended.",1272326400,18,1694,5.116363636363636
3695344,4,B001MBTSK4,"In this episode, you have Ed Sanders and Lewis Yablonski giving intelligent and insightful answers while -- and this is no joke -- Jack Kerouac, who died from alcoholism a short time later, seems to be suffering from delirium tremens.  Kerouac struggles mightily to compose a lucid moment or two, but much of the time, he is trembling, making spastic movements and interrupting with comments that are complete non sequiturs.  What's amazing is how Buckley manages to orchestrate the proceedings.  He almost seems to relish the challenge of incorporating the wayward Kerouac in the presentation.  It is bizarre, something rarely seen on TV, borders on absurdist comedy, but will be sad for fans of the man to see a bloated Kerouac, face ravaged from alcohol abuse, in the final throws of his struggle.",1269993600,16,800,4.992481203007519
3695345,5,B001MBTSK4,"This discourse furnishes conducive insights into the hippie-culture as well as the general counter-culture of the late 1960s. In the discussion Yablonsky notes that the hippie drug use had evolved and developed a proclivity for methamphetamines, which he cites as the cause for the remarkable intensity of violence within the communes he studied as an observer. This point is often overlooked or hastily ignored by the popular-culture of to-day when the counter-culture of the late 1960s is appraised by the mainstream media.",1262131200,3,525,5.414634146341464
8320914,5,B001MBTSK4,"Hilarious interview, and a great cultural moment that deserves more attention. Ever since seeing the 1986 documentary ""What Happened to Jack Kerouac, I've been wanting to see this in it's entirety, and it pays off. Some great back-and-forth between Buckley, Fugs poet Ed Sanders, and a very drunk but still articulate as hell Jack Kerouac. (Interestingly, a justifiably-forgotten sociologist Lewis Yablonsky is the first person listed, and his segments are predictably dry. Kerouac's boorish interruptions are actually a good thing here.) Like the documentary ""Town Bloody Hall"", this is a shining example of how intelligent people with serious ideological disagreements can discuss and debate and in entertaining and productive way, something that's become lost in the current era of ""no platform"".",1506384000,,799,5.6115702479338845
8320915,3,B001MBTSK4,"Well, there is Buckley.  And there is Kerouac.  And there is the quaintness of the time-capsule opened.
Buckley seems to not know what to do with his guests -- lacks a direction.  Insight is not up for grabs.  Acid wit will will have to do, and there is little of that.
  Poor Jack is soused, and it is easy to suspect a sad end.  His ""pal"" Allen Ginsberg, we see the back of his head when the camera pans out -- wonder if he left an account of what he witnessed.  Near as I could tell, Kerouac disowned the guy.  The sociologist professor behaved as we should expect, and we should never expect original thinking from that lot. Delightful that Buckley found refuge here, mostly by-passing the drunk and the kid.  Of the guests, the ""hippie"" kid was making the most sense, but was having a time of it given the forum.  Buckley could have made more of the questions from the audience.
  Sad picking from the time capsule, but maybe worth the momentary look.",1494720000,,956,4.394285714285714
8320916,5,B001MBTSK4,Awesome! Really captures the 60's vibe and life,1473638400,,47,5.0
8320917,5,B001MBTSK4,"Kerouac is the consummate tortured genius. As the other jokers spit rhetoric in steady streams Ol Jack brings a semblance of sensibility and makes you love him even if sometimes rude. It is a shame there are are only two videos I can find of Kerouac, but I am infinitely grateful this exists",1468627200,,291,4.509433962264151
8320918,5,B001MBTSK4,"If you are a fan of Jack Kerouac, this is an interview you must see, as, it shows the many dimensions of the complex man and author who has been called the father of the ""Beat Generation.""",1453593600,,188,4.108108108108108
8320919,5,B001MBTSK4,"Prophetic, at the end Sanders is talking about when the ""hippies"" become the ""command generation"", Kerouac responds with ""Heil  Hitler"", ""command generation!"".... Today the hippies and those that followed their lead are very much the ""command generation"" and to many of us are the new fascist of the 21st century............. though appearing drunk or delusional Jack earlier notes how the Chicago  riots during 68 Democratic Party convention (and very much part of the current political scene and a noted place of controlled anarchy since the 19th century) was all about those that create chaos in order to come in to sustain it, in order to become the ""hero"" (or messiah?), which is an idea very apparent in much of today's current political ""theater"".. Strange how so much clarity can come from the mouth of a drunk...",1405036800,2,821,5.029411764705882
8320920,4,B001MBTSK4,"Good show yes a bit dry for some. Yes Mr Buckley sounds like a pompuous ass.
piece of history.  interesting statement by someone about Nixon before he was elected in 1968 (if they only knew what
we know now about him.  We need more show like this",1396137600,,246,4.212765957446808
8320921,4,B001MBTSK4,"I rate this program with four stars mostly for its historical importance. The irony of this show is that four older guys try to define a youth movement whose slogan is ""never trust anyone over 30."" Ed Sanders is the youngest and great---close to thirty at the time, he's very articulate, and shows patience and respect to the drunken Kerouac. Buckley, too, is quite wonderful with his funny upper crust accent and mad grin. Yablonsky, the social science professor, is boring.

I am sorry for anyone whose only exposure to Kerouac is this show. Here he is already destroyed by alcohol, very drunk, bored, and acting obnoxiously. Of historical interest is Kerouac's famous repudiation of his long-time friend Allen Ginsberg in the last moments of the program.

For anyone wanting to see the beauty of Kerouac before he was really sick, check out the video of him on the Steve Allen Show, where he reads from On the Road.",1377302400,2,918,4.767295597484277
8320922,5,B001MBTSK4,"Buckley, as usual, engaging, humorous, and incisive. He always seemed to select guests with whom he could spar intellectually on a high level. Chomsky and Buckley were fun and informative to watch. Their command of history and its ramifications is interesting no matter which man you agree with. Worth watching.",1362182400,,311,5.24
