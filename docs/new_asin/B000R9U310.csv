8199698,2,B000R9U310,The DVD skips and stops midway through on every DVD player I've tried it on.  It was from a sealed box and I'm pristine in my treatment of DVDs so I have no idea why it won't finish.  I was highly disappointed.,1356825600,,210,3.9761904761904763

8199701,1,B000R9U310,"I was excited about the DVD, but when I tried to play it,
it only runs for 5 minutes then locks up. I've tried it on
a MAC, then a laptop PC, and another PC, but all do the same
thing, so I need a refund or replacement.

8199702,5,B000R9U310,"The other two reviews are spot on about this trumpet instruction DVD by John Thomas.  The DVD is put together well and the relaxed approach by Mr. Thomas is refreshing to watch.  Mr. Thomas revealed that he had had a severe playing slump and describes the comeback process he underwent to return to his current pro level playing ability.  The DVD is packed with insights and techniques he used to return to his pre-slump period. He still practices those techniques to stay performace ready. He imparts his wisdom through example with student volunteers; and through interesting antecdotes.

There are plenty of playing examples and close ups to help solidify his concepts.  The instruction was upbeat and inspirational.

Huge bonus on this DVD, were, for me the interviews with three of the worlds best trumpet players (and three of the most down to earth players as well!) and the closing credits of this DVD.

John and his father play a killer trumpet duet during the credits and the ""pick up band"" that plays here is world class. Mr. Thomas' father is an exciting trumpet player, too, and it is just neat to hear these two side by side.  I would love to get a DVD of the whole recording session.

Great DVD for players of any ability and for comeback players who may be in need to be reassured that even the greats are human!",1209772800,3,1328,4.641025641025641
8199703,5,B000R9U310,Terrific information on basics and other related playing experiences faced by trumpeters in mental and physical situations.  Supplemental exercises by Boyd Hood are wonderful.  A great value of trumpet lessons for the money.,1209340800,3,224,5.757575757575758
8199704,5,B000R9U310,"John Thomas, in a sweet e-mail exchange urged me, a ""comeback"" trumpet player who was having some issues with my progress, to buy his DVD. Well, my first thought was, ""Of course he'll make a dime off of this,"" and then thought, ""hey, this is far cheaper than a lesson."" TSR was worth every dime and then some.

Mr. Thomas, a lead trumpet man of some repute (Basie, USC professorship) compiled a well thought out video that answers all questions regarding playing this special instrument, one of the most physical things one can do in music. He's the son of another great musician, Don Thomas who served as an early inspiration for John after gravitating to trumpet post drummer boy. What's beautiful about this presentation is how Mr. Thomas relates to his students in a personal, self-effacing manner and tosses ego out the door-- HE has had the stage fright, HE has had problems with confidence and range and his equipment, but becomes abundantly clear, through demonstration and his interviews with some of the greats (Snooky Young, Ingrid Jensen, Wayne Bergeron) that this man not only knows his stuff but is as interested in advancing the art and skill of trumpet playing as he is in performing himself. It's a brilliant, accessible presentation.",1188864000,14,1251,4.873239436619718
