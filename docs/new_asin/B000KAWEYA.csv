8155383,5,B000KAWEYA,"(4.5/5 stars) Here is a film, which requires some work from its audience because much of it is ambiguous. Although I might be misreading the intentions of the filmmaker, here is what the film means to me. This film is based upon Frank Wedekind's novella ""Mine Haha: the Corporal Education of Young Girls,"" which was published in 1888.  Herr Wedekind was a German Expressionist playwright, whose best-known works are probably ""Lulu,"" which was the basis of Alban Berg's renowned opera, and ""Pandora's Box,"" which was made into a film starring Louise Brooks. I have not read ""Mine Haha,"" so I cannot compare it to ""Innocence."" What I can say, however, is that the film accomplishes what is not possible in written word. The look and feel of the film are unique and unforgettable, as is the use of visual symbolism. The story begins with a group of pre-pubescent girls opening a small coffin to release a half-naked girl of about six years named Iris. When she asks where her brother is, she is told simply there are no boys there. She soon discovers that she has become a pupil at an all-girls boarding school in the middle of a forest, and leaving it is nearly impossible. The girls spend their days practicing ballet and playing outdoors. There is also a science class, though it does not seem to be very intellectually rigorous. One girl informs Iris that the older women at the school were once students there, but misbehaved and are doomed to spend the duration of their lives there serving the current students. Whether true or not, that is one way the older students keep the younger students in line. In fact, the adults in the film, who are quite few in number, do very little to instruct the girls, discipline them or in other ways prepare the girls for life beyond school. Granted, when the novella was written in 1888, education for girls was probably as limited as the opportunities for them beyond motherhood and being housewives. This attitude is summarized rather succinctly by one of the adult women in speaking with one of the older students when she states something to the effect, ""You'll be able to put your legs to better use once you get out of school."" Perhaps she meant the girl would be able to make living either as a dancer or a prostitute; cynical though it might be, those were two of the very few realities facing her. Today we think of the innocence during childhood years as a time to spend without worries of responsibility while simultaneously being educated and prepared to make a living and being productive members of society. Contrast this with the innocence in the title of this film, when the girls also while away their time without the worries of responsibility, yet receive only a disservice in the form of a lack of education and tips on how to make themselves desirable to men. Those girls, who talk of leaving the school, are discouraged and are told to live with it, since the fate of every girl is to suffer a lifetime of being servants and physical objects to men. At least in some regards, the fate of girls is no longer as bleak as it once was. A cursory perusal of the female's role in media today, however, reveals much of the female's plight has remained the same. Perhaps this is what the film's director, Lucile Hadzihalilovic, had in mind when she stated ""Innocence,"" her feature film directorial debut, would be a horror film...",1202256000,8,3385,4.67001675041876
8155384,5,B000KAWEYA,"I've been waiting for this films USA release for 2 years now, and it did not disappoint. Absolutely not for everyone: it's rife with ambiguity, and intentionally left wide open for personal interpretation. I found it beautiful.  There's a definite creepiness combined with a distinct sense of vulnerability and suspense, and as the title expresses: Innocence.  Do not expect any of your questions to be answered.  There are two wonderful interviews with the director Lucile Hadzihalilovic included in the DVD extras.  I strongly recommend watching them after finishing the film, but don't expect her to give you any answers; she expounds upon her intentions, but is insistent upon leaving the film open to the viewpoint of the audience. Just allow yourself to fall into the world she has created, and let go... If this is your kind of film, I highly recommend Picnic At Hanging Rock as well. Enjoy!",1195516800,11,898,5.006711409395973
8155385,3,B000KAWEYA,"I admit that the first time I saw this movie, I turned the DVD off after about 20 minutes. I felt the movie was just too boring. Then a few months later, a female friend insisted to me that this was a terrific movie, that I should give it another try. So I saw it again. And I have to agree that it improved on second viewing (unfortunately, how you like a particular movie depends on a certain degree on how was your mood that particular day). The movie is set in a mysterious boarding school for little girls, that is surrounded by a sort of enclosed forest, and where the girls don't seem to be taught anything else but ballet. Once a year, a couple of the girls are selected by the school's imperious director, and are taken off the school. To where, the girls are not told. The director (the real life companion of enfant terrible Gaspar Noe) chooses an ambiguous and indirect form of storytelling. The movie suggests a lot, but delivers a little less than it promises. It is an art movie, but with a lot of the mannerisms of the terror genre. And the ending I found a little disappointing. But if you are armed with a little patience, this might be a worthwhile experience.",1169683200,9,1179,4.363636363636363
8155386,4,B000KAWEYA,"`Innocence' opens with an unusual and intriguing sequence, in which a little girl placed in a casket is brought to a secluded place surrounded by a deep forest. The girl's name is Iris, but we don't know where she came from, or where she is now except that the place is actually a school for girls, where things about life are taught by two female teachers. (Its working title was L' cole.) You will gradually come to know more about this curious place, but maybe I should not reveal much about it.

Iris meets her elder student Bianca, who tells her about the rules in this boarding school. All girls must wear ribbon according to their ages; some girls are required to attend the dancing lessens; and most importantly, none of them is allowed to go outside the walls. If they break this rule, it is rumored, they are severely punished, but no one is sure. The two teachers are nice and kind, but look mysterious, sometimes sad.

Lucile Hadzihalilovic's very imaginative film about little girls living and studying in a secluded boarding school will be interpreted in many ways. The film's visuals are often strikingly beautiful, but they sometimes have brooding, oppressive atmosphere. Lucile Hadzihalilovic, partner of Gaspar No, uses much more subdued camerawork to convey the feeling of the school, which is effective without being sensational.

The film is based on a short story ""Mine-Haha"" by German writer Frank Wedekind written in late 19th century. As a result `Innocence' is often symbolic, letting the viewers guess the hidden meanings behind the details. Where do the girls come, and where will they go? What happened to some girls? These things will not be fully explained, but you will be fascinated by the atmospheric images of the film (beautifully shot by Belgian photographer Benot Debie, `Irreversible').

Some may remember the name of Kubrick and his `Eyes Wide Shut,' David Lynch or Dario Argento (yes, that one about a music school). Of course `Innocence' is not a horror film, but there is something mysterious deep inside the boarding school, which is also allegorical.

(The film includes brief nudity, and the scenes of the little girls bathing in the river half naked, during which you may feel uncomfortable though there is nothing voyeuristic about them.)

This is a unique and beautiful blend of realism and imagination, dealt with thoughtful direction. The fascinating film has already a good title `Innocence,' but you may call it `Awakening.' And these things have rarely been depicted as fascinating and tender as this film.",1166313600,27,2560,4.983606557377049
