7373544,1,B013TYXV2M,"1.) Semi-Final Match: Alberto Del Rio w/Zeb Colter vs Roman Reigns

The event kicked off with the first of 2 semi-final matches in the WWE Championship tournament. I'll be honest, I didn't expect anything impressive with this match, but Del Rio and Reigns surprised and they actually. Despite it being predictable who would win, the match moved at a great pace and had some nicely executed moves and close pinfalls. In the end, Del Rio misses his corner double stomp and Reigns takes him out with a Spear for the win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Kevin Owens confronts Reigns backstage and reminds him of the last 2 times he came close to the World Championship and failed before announcing that he's going to win the tournament

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Semi-Final Match: Dean Ambrose vs Kevin Owens

Good outing between Ambrose and Owens. These 2 have good chemistry with each other and I'm looking forward to seeing their feud continue for the rest of the year. Match ends with Ambrose making an impressive counter on the Pop-Up Powerbomb and reversing it with a Dirty Deeds for the win. Good match but it was kind of short for the time

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match: Team Ryback: Ryback, The Lucha Dragons, and The Usos vs Team New Day: New Day, Sheamus, and Bad News Barrett

New Day cuts a hilarious pre-match promo, taking shots at Atlanta and their sports teams while Barrett and Sheamus jam out to New Day's theme music. This was a filler match that had no meaning or build to it and was clearly added at the last minute to take up space on a 3 hour card. The match itself wasn't a whole lot better. It had its moments here and there but for the most part it was nothing to shout home about. Barrett is the first eliminated by Sin Cara, Jimmy Uso is next by Woods, and Sin Cara by Sheamus. After Big E is eliminated by the Jey Uso, Woods and Kofi help him to the back for ""medical attention"", leaving Sheamus there all by himself. Sheamus gets triple teamed by Ryback, Jey, and Kalisto, ending with a Shell Shock to give Team Ryback the win. Bland and random match that had nothing going for it. Wasn't impressed in the slightest

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Diva's Championship Match: Paige vs Charlotte (c)

The controversial contract signing on the go-home episode of Raw was the selling point for this match. Before then it was just the typical, generic divas build-up. Unfortunately this match was pretty mediocre, which is sad to say, considering both of these ladies had some pretty amazing matches back on NXT. Unfortunately for Charlotte, she's not connecting with fans as champion. I don't believe they ever got behind her at all, while there were a few faint cheers and chants for Paige here and there. For such a vanilla match, this lasted a bit too long for my liking. There just wasn't much happening with this match. Strikes here, screaming and shouting there, meh. In the end, Charlotte retains, making Paige tap to the Figure 8

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Tyler Breeze w/Summer Rae vs Dolph Ziggler

Didn't care about this match, didn't pay attention to it, didn't watch it. The only reason for me not watching this match was solely for the fact that the match was only happening because of Summer Rae--who found herself involved in her 5th or 6th love interest angle since 2013. Perhaps Baskin Robbins should add a new flavor of the month, named after Summer. My goodness, WWE has made this woman find her way to nearly half the roster. Breeze wins with the Unprettier

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) The Wyatt Family vs The Brothers of Destruction

The build-up for this match was pretty spectacular with tons of supernatural elements. After kidnapping the Brothers of Destruction and claiming to have devoured their souls and absorbed their power, Bray Wyatt thought Kane and Undertaker were gone for good. That was not to be, as Undertaker and Kane found a way to regain their powers and went into Survivor Series after the Wyatts with a vengeance to celebrate Undertaker's 25th anniversary with the company. Bray picked 2 people from the family to square off against the Brothers of Destruction and the 2 happened to be himself and Luke Harper. I kid you not when I say the best part of this match was The Undertaker's awe-inspiring entrance which featured a ton of fire and what looked to be an open portal to the netherworld showing flashback images of all of Undertaker's gimmick looks since 1990. Taker and Kane take out Rowan in the beginning who tried to attack them and the match was underway. The match itself wasn't bad but it was too short to really say whether it was bad or good. For a feud with such tremendous build, I figured this match would've gotten more air time. During the match, Taker and Kane double Chokeslam Braun Strowman through the announce table, which received a huge pop from the crowd. Taker and Kane do simultaneous Chokeslams on Bray and Harper before Taker finishes off Harper with a Tombstone Piledriver for the win. A short match that could've been more that ended with the Wyatts taking yet another PPV loss

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Finals: Dean Ambrose vs Roman Reigns

The final match to determine who would be the new Heavyweight champion was here. This was yet another quick match that happened too fast. The opening minutes were a spot-fest. It was literally big spot after big spot. Ambrose attempts some running clotheline off the turnbuckle, but Reigns counters it into a Spear for the win.

Confetti pours from the ceiling into the ring as Roman Reigns celebrates his first WWE Championship. Triple H comes down and congratulates Reigns and offers a handshake, but Reigns rejects it with a Spear. No sooner after that, Reigns turns around into a Brogue Kick from Sheamus who cashes in his MITB briefcase. Sheamus makes the pinfall but Reigns kicks out at a close 2. Sheamus counters an attempted Spear into another Brogue Kick for the win. Triple H and Sheamus celebrate to end this dreadful PPV

Overall: Abysmal. Simply abysmal. This Survivor Series was a total fail and I actually regret wasting 3 hours to watch this. First off, this PPV seemed ridiculously rushed for a show that had a 3 hour duration. This and Fast Lane are tied for being the worst PPV of 2015. This year's Survivor Series felt like an ordinary episode of Raw and not like Survivor Series which is sad considering that Survivor Series was one of my PPVs since I first started watching WWE. It was just a major disappointment. Many fans for weeks were expecting either Reigns or Ambrose to turn heel and win the championship. Neither happened and instead we got a cash-in from Sheamus who's now a 3x World Champion. If this isn't the worst Survivor Series of all time, it definitely makes the top 5 list. Overall, this was just an excruciating Survivor Series event to sit through and will forever go down as being one of the worst in WWE history",1448323200,5,7628,5.3172757475083055
7373545,3,B013TYXV2M,"The Title Tournament Semifinals: Roman Reigns vs. Alberto Del Rio was a good match that the crowd was into a lot by the end of it despite the people booing Reigns and chanting about how he stinks ended up chanting this is awesome for the nearfalls. That shows that the work of Reigns and Del Rio won them over. I don't think anybody watching this show thought Del Rio would win, so the result isn't a surprise by any means. Give them credit for working hard and delivering a solid opening match. The 2nd Title Tournament Semifinals: Dean Ambrose vs. Kevin Owens was a great match that I enjoyed a bit more than the one before it. I liked the match quite a bit because Owens was on offense for much of it and got some good nearfalls in there as well. There was a brief moment where I thought maybe Owens would win the match, but not really. Owens was hilarious with his trash talk throughout the match. I like his matches a lot and hes probably my favorite active competitor in WWE right now. Ambrose finding a way to win is the right story. It builds to the intrigue o Reigns vs. Ambrose in the finals. The outcome was no surprise since the Ambrose/Reigns final was obvious from the moment they set up the tournament. The 10 Man tag Team Elimination Tag Match: Ryback, Lucha Dragons (Kalisto & Sin Cara) and The Usos (Jimmy & Jey) vs. The New Day (Xavier Woods, Kofi Kingston & Big E), Sheamus & King Barrett was just okay. They didn't promote the match by announcing any of the participants and there wasn't much of a crowd reaction. If you're going to book a match or 20 minutes on a PPV, why not actually promote it on television? Makes no sense to me. Im not surprised by the babyface victory, but its not like any of those faces are pushed that much. Sheamus is holding the Money in the Bank briefcase, but hes made to look like a loser. I know it didn't look that bad since he was left alone. I just think hes been booked so badly for so long that whenever he does try to cash in the briefcase, people aren't going to care. Barrett losing so early was pretty bad too. This company is sorely lacking in top heels and they don't book them right even when it would make sense to do so. The Divas Title: Charlotte vs. Paige was just an okay match. They tried hard to have a physical match where they each went for submission holds, but the crowd just didn't seem to care. Even with that big spot by the barricade there wasn't much of a reaction to them. I feel bad for the girls because of that because they worked their hearts out and were given a lot of time. It just didn't click as well as WWE would have liked. The finish bothered me a bit because Paige was so close to the ropes. They should have done it more towards the middle of the ring. Thats just a minor thing, but its important. As for Charlotte retaining, that was no surprise since she has held the title for only two months. I thought it might be a disqualification finish in order to keep the feud going, but that didn't happen. The Tyler Breeze vs. Dolph Ziggler match was just a filler bout and that's that. The Undertaker & Kane vs. Bray Wyatt & Luke Harper tag team match was a pretty standard match that was all about having Undertaker hit his signature spots. He looked good for the most part. As I said at the start, Harper getting pinned was the right call. The negative thing to this match is that the Wyatt Family did the job and thats a bad thing. They could use some wins. They still protected Strowman by not putting him in the match. Yes, he went through a table, but it took two guys to do it. Its not like he was buried by one guy. I hope Wyatt is booked strongly after this loss. The World Heavyweight Championship Tournament Finals: Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose was a shorter match than I was expecting. Reigns winning wasn't a surprise to me at all. He was the favorite and he won it clean. It would have been better if it was a 20 minute classic with a lot of nearfalls for both guys, but I guess WWE felt like doing a shorter match, which is fine. They could have made that Reigns moment feel like a bigger deal because they really rushed to the finish. However, as soon as it ended like that it started making me think that there would be a Money in the Bank cash in due to how much time was left in the show. The MITB cash-in match between Roman Reigns & Sheamus was just a filler bout too but this one was to create a new feud. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1448323200,,4453,4.209356725146199
7373546,4,B013TYXV2M,this years survivor seeries brings back the tournament not seen since deadly games 1996  for wwe world championship due to seth rollins untimely injury really wanted to see him get beat.

7373553,3,B013TYXV2M,"It should be noted that WWE was listed as a possible terrorist target by ISIS to which WWE responded to by having Lillian Garcia sing the National Anthem at the start of the show.

Roman Reigns vs. Alberto Del Rio - The first semi-final match of the WWE Championship tournament as the action got taken to the outside different times of the match with both men taking advantage of their surroundings whenever possible as Del Rio heavily focused on a specific part of Roman's body including using his own momentum against him injuring that area even more while Reigns relied on his power as they traded momentum avoiding or having counters for different offense in mid-move in a back & forth opening match.

Dean Ambrose vs. Kevin Owens - The second semi-final match as they briefly fought on the outside with Owens using his size to his advantage along with taking some shortcuts & innovative counters like turning a superplex into a top rope fireman's carry while Ambrose took advantage of mistiming & distractions with physical offense like a clothesline that turned Owens inside out & kept having counters for the pop up powerbomb in another competitive contest.

Elimination Match: Ryback & Lucha Dragons & The Usos vs. The New Day & Sheamus & Bad News Barrett - The second traditional Survivor Series elimination match of the night that had it's set of highlights such as Xavier Woods hair (I'm not making this up), the interaction Sheamus & Barrett had ""getting jiggy with it"" with New Day throughout the match, the aerial offense by the Usos & Dragons that even caused Ryback to fly, and some tension between some of the team members that eventually played out bad for one person in a good match.

Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Paige - Charlotte started out very aggressive taking Paige down by the waist multiple times & both women trading forearms on the apron before Paige took advantage of her surroundings to heavily work over the back as both got more intense with both men using different parts of the ring to inflict more punishment to each other along with other impactful offense & submissions both in & outside of the ring in what was a physical encounter.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Tyler Breeze - Both men tried ""showing off"" early only for Dolph to get the advantage causing Breeze to use whatever he could for a distraction to get the advantage with offense like a half crab while Dolph was able to catch Breeze in mid-air with a dropkick as they went through a sequence of pin reversals & trading momentum in a solid but short match.

Undertaker & Kane vs. Wyatt Family - 25 years to the day that Undertaker debuted in WWE he reunites with his brother with one of the more unique entrances he's ever had including showcasing how he's constantly evolved over time as both brothers took out one member of the Wyatts right away to ensure they had Bray in the match as the Brothers Of Destruction dominated both as a team & individually using their signature moves causing another member of the Wyatts on the outside getting involved giving them a numbers advantage only for Undertaker & Kane to come back in a dominate fashion that saw not only one member of the Wyatts taken out on the outside but also do something that stopped Bray Wyatt dead in his spiderwalk in what wasn't as much as a competitive match more than a spectacle & celebration for Undertaker.

WWE Championship Match: Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose - The remaining two ex-members of The Shield started trading fist right at the bell with Reigns using his power to toss Ambrose while Ambrose used his daredevil offense sacrificing himself just to hurt his opponents like the Cactus Jack over the top rope clothesline & suicide dive while also focusing on the part of Roman's body that was hurt earlier in the night as both men counter or avoided offense & hit their trademark move only for their opponent to kick out in what was a non-stop fast paced physical match with the even bigger story & final image of the night happening 5 minutes & 15 seconds later.

(Kickoff Match) Elimination Match: Dudley Boyz, Neville, Titus O'Neal, Goldust vs. The Miz, Bo Dallas, Stardust, The Ascension - The first traditional Survivor Series elimination match featured solid action but very little highlights such as the return of Goldust & him starting off the match against his brother Stardust & later one man actually talking himself into an elimination in a solid match.

If I'm focusing strictly on the in-ring action (because I could have plenty to say in a negative light like others have elsewhere about the actual booking when it came to the final moments of the show) then his was a good card from top to bottom but if you don't let that overshadow the entire card then it's a show I would check out.",1449360000,3,4774,4.687350835322196

7373555,4,B013TYXV2M,"I see that a lot of people are down on this one and I guess I understand why, but I disagree. Not liking who walks away the WHC doesn't take away from the rest of the PPV.

Roman Reigns vs. Del Rio is a pretty good start to the PPV. I don't think ATL was completely sold on Roman Reigns. It will probably be like that everywhere he goes.

Ambrose vs. Kevin Owens is a really good match. It's a little short I guess, but the winner is going to wrestle a second time, so you know. Besides, quality over quantity. Ambrose and Owens really bring the physicality and it's going to be great to see them feud going forward. Some feuds you instantly get tired of, but this is one you instantly want to see more of.

Charlotte vs. Paige for the Divas Championship The crowd was really checked out of this, but it was actually a good Divas match. Much better than the Bella effort this time last year.

Kane and The Undertaker vs The Wyatt's Undertaker's entrance is one the most epic of his entire career. This match is not a 5 star classic, but the Brothers of Destruction get their retribution on The Wyatt's and we get to pay tribute to 25 years of the Undertaker. I loved this.

Reigns vs. Ambrose in the WHC tourny finals It was pretty much a forgone conclusion that Roman would be the champion at the end of SS and that these two would be the in the finals. I was really hoping for a heel turn by either Reigns or Ambros, but it was a pretty good match between the two. The twist came when Sheamus cashed in MITB on Reigns. Reigns was the WHC for 5:15

Spoilers

1.[ELIMINATION MATCH]GOLDUST, THE DUDLEY BOYZ, TITUS ONEAL & NEVILLE VS STARDUST, THE MIZ, BO DALLAS & THE ASCENTION-the thing I love most about this event is the actual matches it was created for, the elimination matches. This was a good opener that should have been on the actual PPV since it is an elimination match. This was a good open with eliminations coming quick, especially at the beginning. In the end it would be the Dudleys and Titus who would survive.

2. ALBERTO DEL RIO VS ROMAN REIGNS-this was the first semi final match leading up to a new WWE Champion. Of course I knew going in that Reigns was going to win as it was very obvious but I was still going for Del Rio here. This was a great opening match on the PPV with Del Rio trying to work over reigns and his arm. Roman of course fought back using his power to his advantage. Reigns gets the victory here in a great opening bout.

3. DEAN AMBROSE VS KEVIN OWENS-we follow that match up with the next semi final match and once again it is a great match. Two of my favorites do battle here in a great back and forth affair. It is a hard hitting contest with Owens looking as if he is set to win but Ambrose takes it after some dirty deeds. Great match full of counters and action.

4.[ELIMINATION MATCH]RYBACK, THE LUCHA DRAGONS & THE USOS VS THE NEW DAY, SHEAMUS & KING BARRETT-the second elimination match of the night featured a lot of great wrestlers including the excellent New day, as usual they were super funny prior and during the match. This was a fun contest with some great moments including five guys flying. Also New Day taking a classic heel route that leads to Sheamus going it alone. In the end he gets eliminated ensuring that his team lost.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS PAIGE-this was a really good Divas match that had two actual wrestlers going at it. The match was a good hard fought contest with a good mix of technical and brawling abilities shown by both. Good back and forth match that would see Charlotte retain the title.

6. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS TYLER BREEZE-this was a good match between two gifted guys, Dolph in particular is a favorite. A short match but a good back and forth contest with some good counters and an excellent way to get to a half grab by Breeze. Breeze ends up getting the victory.

7. THE WYATT FAMILY VS THE BROTHERS OF DESTRUCTION-this was The Undertaker and Kane taking on Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper. The match in my opinion was a little short considering the build to this. The Wyatts start out strong with Bray looking really good taking Kane on the outside even and over the table. But the Brothers of Destruction make a comeback and take the Wyatts out after Taker lands a tombstone on Harper. The fans go crazy which is what this match was about as Taker had debuted at this event twenty five years earlier.

8.[WWE TITLE MATCH]ROMAN REIGNS VS DEAN AMBROSE-the finals of the tournament would see the two best friends going at it. This was a short match especially for a finals match but it was really fast paced. Both men employ some hard hitting tactics and counter various moves including each others signatures, in fact they kick out of said signatures. But Roman Reigns supreme [see what I did there] after a spear winning the World Title.

9.[WWE TITLE]ROMAN REIGNS VS SHEAMUS-that last match lead to this one as Triple H comes out only to distract Roman as he gets blasted by Sheamus who cashes in his money in the bank briefcase. A second kick later sees Roman quickly lose his title and Sheamus becoming champion once again.

I enjoyed this event and thought it was pretty good. A worthy addition to any wrestling collection.",1463011200,,3693,4.521739130434782
