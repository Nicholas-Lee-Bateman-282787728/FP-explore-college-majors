6356311,5,B00JF5GAY6,"This  movie was like WOLF CREEK meets FAST AND THE FURIOUS.
It has plenty of fast paced action and plenty of original gory death scenes.
The actors where likable and kept me interested,... in each one of their outcomes.
The film is well made and well acted...GREAT OLD SCHOOL EFECTS !
Besides WOLF CREEK 2, this is the best horror movie released this year,... for hardcore gore!
OL' RUSTY NAIL,, IS A UP AND COMMING HORROR ICON,.... WITH HIS ABILITY FOR BLOODY COOLNESS !",1401840000,10,471,4.607142857142857
6356312,4,B00JF5GAY6,"As a person who liked Joyride 1&2 I was excited to see the third installment in this franchise. This time around they turn the blood and Gore up to splatter status. The effects were good, no CGI but old school  practical effects.

The acting was good and there was a lot of action such as explosions and the main characters are transporting a race car to Canada so you get your fill of cat and mouse  chases with Rusty Nail and the other characters.

There were some unique kills and some OMG moments making the film quite a fun ride, literally!",1401753600,14,545,4.366336633663367
6356313,2,B00JF5GAY6,"Some franchises get better over time, some maintain quality, and, sadly, too many go downhill. This film fits into the latter. JR3 uses a cheap gimmick of bare breasts and a sex scene to lure you in, then there's the obligatory first murder scene that is a common and overused trope in horror films. The first victims are drug addicts, but it bugged me how the female asks for a ""bump"" of whatever she's smoking in a glass pipe -- to my understanding, a bump refers to snorted cocaine, but she seems like a meth addict. It's like the writer was trying to use cool drug lingo but didn't know what they were talking about. Rusty Nail is not voiced by Ted Levine, which to me made the first film more compelling; the first film was also an interesting premise and overall a semi-decent ""B"" movie. But JR3 is just a shadow of that first film -- the first ten minutes are a rather empty display of lowest common denominator sex and violence with no substance. It looks made on the cheap and I wouldn't be surprised if it was written by middle-schoolers: ""DRUG ADDICT MALE waits by the door to knock out Rusty Nail with a lampshade -- but Rusty GRABS the lampshade when he comes into the sleazy motel room!"" Etc etc. It ends up just being a stupid experience. I mean, how many times can you tell the same story as the first film again and again? Maybe they should combine the Joy Ride franchise with the Leprechaun one.",1473465600,,1413,4.396946564885496
6356314,1,B00JF5GAY6,"While this movie maybe the third one in the series, its by far the least interesting in terms of the mystery behind rusty-nail. I feel like this film tried to copy the Saw movie franchise in the torture and killing for replacing the dark mysterious aura of rusty-nail. Although while the first couple that contacted him on the CB radio did meet a likewise fate like previous characters that screwed with rusty in the past, that was about good as it got.
I personally feel like alot of common sense was left out for the characters, like instead of splitting up they all should've stayed together, and when traveling together if you don't see the headlights of your partners vehicle either slow down or stop until you do.
Rusty resorts to killing way too often compared to Joy Ride 1 and 2, with that said this isn't a bad movie to rent just don't buy it because you might be disappointed.",1462665600,,887,4.515527950310559

ROADKILL

The first film in this series is one of my favorite flicks out there. it had the right amount of suspense and horror to make it a great thriller. The second film was not as good but I did enjoy it for a direct to DVD flick. So when this one came out I was excited to see it. The wait was worth it as it turned out to be good for what it was. The character of Rusty Nail is a fun villain for the franchise.

A group of friends are on their way to a Rally to enter the race and have to travel up to Canada. While on the way testing out the car on a back highway they come across a truck that they mess with a little bit. As it turns out the driver is one Rusty Nail, a serial killer that does not appreciate the games. Now it is a race to the border as they try to get away from the madman in the truck.

This film was written and directed by Declan OBrien who wrote, directed or both on films like Wrong Turn 3, 4 & 5, Sharktopus, The Marine 3 among others. I enjoyed all of those films as well as the others of his I have seen. This film fits in with his style so I knew what to expect going into this. The movie is a little gorier than previous entries and has practical effects instead of CGI as pointed out in the special features.

The acting is on point for a direct to DVD film especially for Rusty Nail played by part 2s stuntman Ken Kirzinger. So it was probably an easy transition for him here. The friends are all pled well here but there is something I have to point out, there is no likeable characters here. Seriously when you think there is at least one who is not annoying or shouldnt die they ruin it. I won't say what happens but you will understand once you watch it. But with that said it kinda makes it more fun, once you dislike all of them you are rooting for the killer t take them out, sounds weird but it is a movie not real life.

You get behind the scenes stuff among others features here but it is the commentary that I enjoyed the most. I would recommend this film to any fan of the series or horror buffs in particular. There are some cool moments and kills to be found here. One in particular happens right at the beginning so watch for that. Heres to hoping for a part four, I would buy it.",1424390400,,2242,3.9623059866962307

6356401,1,B00JF5GAY6,"They have turned it into a torture movie and it is to bloody without tension and suspense. The acting and dialogue leave much to be desired. All the mystery and intrigue has been removed, and some of the scenes make no sense. For instance, dude is yelling ""WE ARE LOST! WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE"" and then bails out of his friends car in response to the disagreement and starts walking in the dark. Now, if you are truly lost and do not know where you are, how are you going to know which way to walk?  It is totally half-baked in all areas.",1403654400,12,542,4.161904761904762

6356405,3,B00JF5GAY6,"I thought I could count on this one to satisfy but instead it was just a tease. First off, Rusty is played by a different actor. While he was never a unitary character (image and voice supplied by 2 different actors; the voice JR2 was actually played by a different person than in 1 but he did a good job of imitating it), in JR3, the voice is altogether different. Not that its all in the voice but this character was 90% voice in the past. The original voice actor was ideal and its a shame they couldn't get him on board. Rusty's voice was distinctive. Not so in this one. He comes across like a regular trucker type, of course until he busts out the instruments of torture. Therein lies the rub. For me, the most gratifying part of horror movies is the visceral tension they generate (at their best, of course), and if there's a puzzle to solve, even better. But I felt no tension while watching this whatsoever. So on to the next one...  Still, if you are iike me, you will watch this regardless of what anyone feels about it. After all, its Rusty Nail and who can resist that?!",1403049600,10,1083,4.3088235294117645
6356406,3,B00JF5GAY6,"To be straightforward, I gave this movie 3 stars, NOT because it was good, but because it wasn't completely terrible!  Sorry if that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but let's see if I can clear this up a bit.  As with most ""straight to DVD/VOD"" sequels, this one isn't nearly as entertaining as the original from which it is taken.  If the movie were going to be really good, it would have gotten a major release.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have the star power or the intensity of the original.  What it DOES have is a total and complete reveal of ""Rusty Nail"" constantly throughout the film.  BIG MISTAKE!  This only takes away from the terror of his role.  We aren't supposed to see him.  He's supposed to be a sort of ""phantom"" to the viewer, in my opinion.  Also (this might be a spoiler), but if you're in a souped up RACECAR, just leave that guy in the dust.  He's in a Big Rig that can probably only top out at 90.  Just seemed to be a REALLY dumb part of the story to me.  Either way, this movie is probably exactly what you think it is.  It's a time filler that, while really bad compared to the original, isn't too bad if you're just in the mood for some cheap entertainment.

Final Verdict:  Pass

6356407,2,B00JF5GAY6,"""You don't want to take that road, trust me."" A group of street racers head off to a race and they stop in a small town for lunch. While there they ask what the quickest way to get to their destination is. When they are told to avoid the fast road because of its history they laugh and take it anyway. As a joke they decide to cut off a truck driver. This little action pits them against the dangerous Rusty Nail (Kirzinger). There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. The original was good and tense because it was new and different. A harmless prank that you could see yourself doing leads to something no one can imagine. Much like everything in the last 10 years if enough people like it a franchise begins. The second one was a bland version of the original and this one isn't much better. The thing that made the first one so interesting was the originality of it. This one has no surprises at all and you can see everything coming a mile away. All that said though because this is the third movie in the series and since it is a straight to video B-rate movie you really can't expect much more then that. Overall, exactly what you would expect from the third movie in a series that didn't need a sequel to begin with. I give this a C.",1402790400,3,1254,4.20746887966805
6356408,4,B00JF5GAY6,"It was quite a surprise to pick this up after not even hearing a 3rd sequel was in the works. The first movie was a great ride, the second was OK, but the 3rd is the bloodiest Rusty Nail has ever been.

The movie kicks off with a bit of a homage to the original, just to get this thing into gear, then the rest of the plot involves a group of race drivers and their team. They are heading to Canada for a race, and decide while they are on a long stretch of highway with no one around for miles, they may as well take the souped up race car for a spin. But guess who else is rolling along that highway? When the racer decides to do a stupid trick and almost run Rusty off the road... well, if you've seen the other two films, you know Rusty isn't much for just reporting things or letting anyone off the hook that easy. Rusty chases them down and you can guess where things go from there!

It's filmed well, the acting is decent, sounds fine, and the blood and gore effects are pretty good. It's a nice combination that does a 3rd sequel well, and making me hope a 4th installment gets made.

It's not the perfect film however, sure I may watch it again now and then, but there is a couple of little things I'd have done differently.  I think even tho they never showed a proper shot of Rusty Nail's face, there was a bit too much of it exposed, and it should have remained a mysterious look hiding in shadows. There was a few moments in this I just thought that showing Rusty's face made him less intimidating. He kind of reminds me of the John Goodman look in The Big Lebowski. But I guess it was made up for in that Rusty really seems to be off his meds this time around, and is more psychotic than ever, and getting a little more creative with his kills!",1402444800,3,1758,4.101744186046512

6356410,2,B00JF5GAY6,"I actually really enjoyed the second ""Joy Ride,"" but this second straight-to-DVD sequel is unfortunately pretty terrible. Leave it to Declan O'Brien to ruin another Direct-to-DVD horror series (The ""Wrong Turn"" movies took a turn for the worst after a surprisingly awesome second installment when he took over). Fox should have been hiring ""Wrong Turn 2"" Director Joe Lynch for these movies. No clue why he never came back after his sequel was actually pretty well-received. He hasn't done much since then.

Anyway, Fox, please stop hiring Declan O'Brien. Thank you.",1402272000,3,566,5.21978021978022
6356411,4,B00JF5GAY6,"The film opens with a five star horror scene with sex, f-bombs, and nudity (Sara Mitch). We discover how much better sex is smoking a glass pipe.. when you have enough. And then road kill. After the credits we get into the main plot as a group of young adults head up to Canada to race their car. They take the infamous Rt. 17 and hit a Rusty Nail (Ken Kirzinger) along the way.

The restaurant scene was great with Barry (David Ferry) spouting off his conspiracy theories about Rt. 17 and the waitress (Heather Hueging). After they hit the road and get to the meat of the film, the character dialogue dies and the film degrades into a middle of the road slasher film.

The film under utilized Kirsten Prout who I would have loved in that opening scene. She has that Taylor Swift/ Anne Kendrick/Marsha Brady appeal and could have at least showered once.  3 1/2 stars",1402099200,5,866,4.433962264150943

8650432,4,B00JF5GAY6,"RELEASED TO VIDEO IN 2014 and directed by Declan O'Brien, Joy Ride 3: Roadkill depicts horrific events on the backroads of the American prairie when a youthful racing crew on their way to Road Rally 1000 mess with the wrong trucker, Rusty Nail.

Rusty Nail obviously moved from his former location in the desert wilderness far outside Las Vegas, Nevada, to the lonesome prairies of Texas (note his license plate and the Kansas plates of the racers). The change in locale to the flatland prairie/forests (shot in the Winnipeg area) makes for a slightly different ambiance to Joy Ride 2, but story-wise its more-of-the-same, minus the obnoxious goth-punk.

The first Joy Ride (2001) was akin to a modern-day Duel (1971), but with eye-rolling improbabilities, particularly in the last act. Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead took that template and added slasher & torture porn elements, which is what you get with this one. But I like the protagonists better, led by Jesse Hutch, the race car driver. Kirsten Prout and Leela Savasta are effective in the feminine department with Kirsten being particularly adorable, but both need to gain at least 12-15 lbs.

This is the first movie that reveals Rusty from the get-go (Ken Kirzinger), which is interesting, but they shouldve kept his identity a mystery IMHO, like in Duel and the first two movies, not that it matters much. At the end of the day this is a throwaway slasher thriller, but it works for what it is, an over-the-top slasher-horror on the American highways. Turn off your brain and enjoy the quick, implausibly horrific ride. If you can't do this, stay away.

THE MOVIE RUNS 95 minutes and was shot in Winnipeg and Provincial Rd 305, Tourond, Manitoba, Canada. WRITER: Clay Tarver. ADDITIONAL CAST: Benjamin Hollingsworth, Gianpaolo Venuta and Jake Manley play the remaining race crew.
