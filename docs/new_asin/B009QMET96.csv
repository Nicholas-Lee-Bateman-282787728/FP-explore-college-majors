5361024,5,B009QMET96,"This video has become my daily exercise no matter what  exercises I do each day.  Or should I say I alternated between the seated and standing Tai Chi.  I have arthritis and I saw marked improvements in my flexibility after the first use, from my feet to my head. If you are wanting to feel great
everyday use this tape.  My sister i law, who is in perfect health, feels the same way.  I plan to purchase all five.",1487030400,18,414,4.189873417721519

5361030,5,B009QMET96,"Fu-Style Healing: Powerful Chi Kung System for Health and Wellness

The FU-STYLE HEALING EXERCISE | STANDING ENERGY PRACTICE DVD is a great workout for people of all experience levels: Everyone can reap the health benefits of Chi Kung and Healing Energy through
this video.

The emphasis on breathing techniques, coordination of breath and movement, integration of waist turning, in conjunction with Tai Chi leg movements and stepping, makes this a safe and perfect wellness tool for people with arthritis, chronic pain, stress and trauma conditions.

Instructor Tommy Kirchhoff's instructions are clear and easy to follow. The pacing is excellent. The
production is crisp. The camerawork is right on the money.

There are many Chi Kung DVDs on the market. I feel FU-STYLE HEALING EXERCISE has many exercises
never before covered in other Chi Kung programs.

Because of the way the movements are broken down focusing on proper body mechanics and alignment, coupled with the clarity of the instruction, this DVD will be incredibly helpful for those interested in learning Tai Chi forms of any style.

Get ready for a solid and complete workout that clocks in at close to an hour.

I felt rejuvenated, relaxed and refreshed after just one workout and I'm sure you will too.",1370217600,31,1271,5.111111111111111

8543763,1,B009QMET96,"I wanted something simple to start with,, but this was so boring I could not get through the entire CD. He does the same motions multiple times and actually too calm, monotone voice with no warmth. I don't know is this is what Tai Chi is supposed to be like, but if if is, I will not be doing this form of exercise!!",1517788800,2,316,4.031746031746032

But, finally it began to play so I could see the instructor. Although, there were still some lines going through the video. I felt the quality was sub par. There were no scratches on the disc and my player is top line.",1489881600,3,359,4.294117647058823
