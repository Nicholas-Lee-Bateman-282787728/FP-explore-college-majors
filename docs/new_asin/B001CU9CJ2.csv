8289567,1,B001CU9CJ2,"Just like my review for Move Over Darling, I feel duped. Recordable media? Amazon lists the title and beneath the title it say DVD. What's so hard about being upfront and listing DVD-R in that location? Instead, they write ""When sold by Amazon.com, this product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply"" in an editorial review. located halfway down the page. It's not even in the mentioned in the product details. If I want to know what type of disc I'm getting, I expect to find the info in the listing title or the product details. I should not have to read editorial reviews or customer comments. And to make it worse, it has only a moderate quality transfer and lousy packaging. It doesn't even have anything (like the title) printed on the spine, just a blank, black spine.",1507939200,,840,4.760273972602739
8289568,5,B001CU9CJ2,"THE NIGHT THEY TOOK MISS BEAUTIFUL (1977) begins at a beauty contest. After the contest is over, the contestants are loaded onto a chartered airplane, that looks as if it couldn't possibly resist gravity! Thankfully, Mike O'Toole (Chuck Connors- THE HORROR AT 37,000 FEET, SOYLENT GREEN) is in the tower! Along for the ride, are former pageant winner Kate Malloy (Stella Stevens- THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE), and Reba Bar Lev (Victoria Principal- EARTHQUAKE), off-duty pilot Paul Faviani (Gary Collins), and ruthless hijackers, Omar (Gregory Sierra) and Buck (Jonathan Banks), who force the pilot to make an unscheduled landing. Omar and Buck meet up w/ their cohort, Layla (Sheree North), while the passengers are taken off, and herded into an old warehouse. Layla is a loose cannon w/ a habit, and boy, does she need a fix! She's also the most interesting character in the movie! Meanwhile, back at the airport, government agents get involved, and make decisions that could spell the end for everyone! It seems that someone aboard the plane was carrying a hyper-lethal biological weapon! The tension rises exponentially from this point, as Buck grows increasingly impatient, and Layla goes crazier by the minute. TNTTMB is an excellent thriller for its time period. Extra credit for Karen Lamm's (ANTS, THE UNSEEN) portrayal of Cindy Lou Barrett, and Marcia Lewis as her less-than-innocent mother. Highly recommended...",1502668800,,1417,5.274336283185841

8289570,3,B001CU9CJ2,"A run of the mill made for TV movie. Chuck Connors saved the flick with his totally believable role as airport chief of keeping everything safe. The real star of the movie is the seaplane. Victoria Principal's Grocho Marxx will be viewed as a classic bit years from now.  Mama sending her little girl out back to serve the kidnapper, brings 1970's drama to the little screen. Every time they pass the cigar tube with the toxic germs to one another, take a drink. If you want, fast forward and watch Cary Collins sacrifice his life to save mankind.",1430870400,,547,4.525252525252525
8289571,2,B001CU9CJ2,"I remember watching this on tv when it came out.  It didn't impress me as a teenager and it doesn't impress me much, now.  The actors, with the exception of Gregory Sierra, just walk through their rolls or ""act"" with a capital ""A"".  It's like watching an episode of 'The Love Boat' or 'Fantasy Island' - a parade of old stalwarts (Stella Stevens, Phil Silvers, Sheree North, Chuck Connors, Peter Haskell), a few newer faces like Victoria Principal, Karen Lamm (""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" ""The Unseen"" ""Ants""), some decorative touches like Gary Collins, Henry Gibson, and ALL people who would've benefited from a better script.  The plot sounds promising - hijacking a plane and kidnapping 5 beauty contestants plus extra passengers (including uber stage mother ""Mama Barrett"", played by Marcia Lewis) for a ransom of $1 Million (seemed like more money back then) and an escape plane.  The cast of characters includes four low-lifes including Gregory Sierra & Sheree North, who's ""on the stuff"" but going cold turkey right now; a couple of Secret Agents transporting a cigar vial containing enough deadly virus to wipe out the ""entire United States"" (Collins, Principal); an unfunny, ailing emcee (SIlvers); a former pageant winner (Stella Stevens) and her Wig, an airport security chief with integrity (Chuck Connors); and cliche'  gov't agents (Haskell) with a secret agenda and obligatory dark glasses, who are in charge of Taking Care of Business (TCB); all end up on an island for the final face down.  Who will survive?  There's not really much tension, there's an obvious but perhaps unintended reminder of why beauty contests became seen as little more than meat displays, and a reminder that even gov't cover ups can be dull. With Don Kirshner on board as one of the executive producers.  Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.  The only real stand outs in the cast are the German beauty contestant, played by Lillian Muller, and Principal. With proper direction, production, script, score, etc. this could have been a really entertaining little movie.",1419120000,,2071,5.0825958702064895
8289572,5,B001CU9CJ2,"The Night They Took Miss Beautiful was released on television on October 24, 1977 starring Victoria Principal, Gary Collins, and Chuck Conners.

Summary: The movie opens with five women in a beauty contest that's being shown on national TV. Marv baker who had a little too much to drink is announcing the five winners of the beauty contest. The next morning the 5 winning contenders are at the airport waiting to take a flight to NASA. While contestants are waiting, two men go up into the plane dressed as mechanics. Rolly Royce who is the director goes to Mike O'Toole wanting to know why he's not letting the fans go out to the plane to cheer for the contestants. O'Toole is worried about people getting hurt at his airport and that's why he forbid the people to go to the plane. While the contestants were boarding the plane they were greeted by the media and there camera's. As the women went up the ramp they posed for pictures in there each and unique way. Once the airplane gets into the air, the two men dressed in mechanic outfits come out and enter the cockpit of the airplane. The two men tell the pilot to drop the plane to under two hundred feet. When one of the pilots tries to contact, the tower he is shot.

Questions: What was the two men dress as mechanic doing on the plane? Did the pilot who contacted the tower live? Why did the two men want the plane to fly under two hundred feet? Where did the men want the plane to go? What happen to the contestants that were on the plane? Where did the plane land?

My Thoughts: I bought this movie because of Victoria Principal and I wasn't disappointed. I thought she played her character very well. I also thought that Sheree North was great in her character as Layla Burden. She played the role of a whacked out crazy person with a gun. The movie was slow getting started because of the beauty contest. However once the contest was over the movie took off and it kept my attention. Because of Victoria and Sheree, I give this movie 10 weasel stars. If you're interested in this movie you can buy it at Amazon.com",1390089600,2,2077,4.417754569190601
8289573,2,B001CU9CJ2,"I remembered this movie from my childhood, seeing it on late tv.  All I remembered was a flight with a group of ""Miss America"" finalists is hijacked and it starred Victoria (Dallas) Principle, Stella (Poseidon Adv)Stevens, Chuck (The Rifleman) Connors, and Gary (Hour Magazine) Collins.

This movie plays like a really bad episode of Charlies Angels.  Fun for the 70s nostalgia, but several scenes will definitely make you cringe. Especially the scenes that showcase the contestants ""talent"".",1223251200,4,492,5.363636363636363
