8606424,1,B00EKPLWEE,"Change the lyrics from ""The Wizard of Oz"" song ""If I only had a Brain"" to ""If We Only had a Script"".  This film should have been a master piece.  This time it wasn't Val Kilmer's fault.  There were beautifully shot scenes, great sets, good acting, great filming, music, ... the whole ball of wax.  Bruce Dern is one of my favorite actors and he was fine.  Through the first hour, or so, I was thrilled.  ""Wow, this is going to be great.  Val Kilmer has finally picked a winner.""
  The best analogy -that I can come up with right  now- is:  culinary.  You are eating or drinking something that is the best you ever had- or at least right up there.  With about 20% of the drink or meal left  you find something that is repulsive,  It's so repulsive that you can never remember the greatness of what you've tasted.  This movie petered out into an ending that was a total failure.  Anybody  that has passed the 2nd grade should be able to written a better ending.
  If you only watch the first hour of a film; and never finish the film, then you will be thrilled by: ""Twixt"".  If you enjoy being let down by a weak contrived ending then this may be your film.  An idea would be to get friends together watch 75%-80%, shut it off, and make up your own endings.  Everyone wins because all endings will be better then the movie's real ending.",1459123200,,1335,4.2730923694779115
