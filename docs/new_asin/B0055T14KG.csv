4581222,5,B0055T14KG,"Tis is the latest among Dr. Paul Lam's ongoing releases of tai chi practice associated with health and well being. In this particular release Laoshi Lam undertakes to combine movements from two distinct styles of tai chi, Chen and Sun styles, and delivers it as ""Tai Chi for Energy"" . Personally I find this to be his best effort yet, Many purists will complain, but one must remember that Dr. Lam does not present his work as ""martial art"", per se, but rather as health improvement programs. I think anyone interested in tai chi would find this an interesting, entertaining, and useful resource.",1318896000,30,596,4.796116504854369

8458797,5,B0055T14KG,"I know Dr. Lam is the best there is at Tai Chi, but the reason I liked this so well, is it helps me to keep up with my exercises on the days I am not in class.
My teacher recommended this as a daily help, and she was so right.  Dr. Lam is so precise, it can't help to make you better.
He helps me to stay the course.  Great DVD.  I also enjoy the fact that he works with his daughter in some of the exercises.",1392249600,8,409,3.625
