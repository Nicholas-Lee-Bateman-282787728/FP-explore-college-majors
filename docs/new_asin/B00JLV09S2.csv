6381375,5,B00JLV09S2,I can not tell you how excited I am that this movie is finally being released on DVD. I have been searching for this movie for years. One of my absolute favorite christmas movies of all time!,1347062400,27,191,4.1891891891891895

6381379,3,B00JLV09S2,"I still prefer  "":A Diva Christmas"" because it was so clever in many ways ""cut Marlies brakeline, or so I heard"" this is not a bad telling of the story though it lacks a lot of charm that other similar Carol movies in its presentation. What is wrong here mainly is the fact that this movie on IMDB is shown to be 96 Minutes. And indeed, according to my wife who I basically got it for, there are missing scenes, such as when Ebbie asks the homeless to move to another block and gives her $10.00 and the follow up scene where she finds the woman right back there outside her store.

Also the movie allows you to call up subtitles mode for the film and nothing happens,  though Amazons description never states anything about subtitles, yet  in case it was wrong, I went into subtitle mode just in case and nothing was presented on the screen.",1479600000,,841,4.337579617834395
6381380,4,B00JLV09S2,"For all you out who love the Christmas movie 'Ebbie', I believe this is it! ( will know better come December). Different title and an odd package cover art (where is THAT scene in the film!?)

I have been watching Ebbie since I was a little girl and I have noticed that for the past few years it has not been coming on around the holidays. I just happened to type in Ebbie on amazon and when this came up, I absolutely jumped at the chance to purchase it. I ordered it and it came a day later and I watched it that day even though it's September lol. I pretty much love any version of A christmas carol, and this is one of my favorites.

6381427,5,B00JLV09S2,"Interesting how they took the Christmas Carol story's plot and turned it into a whole different story. Susan Lucci never disappoints, and she didn't in this.  Good supporting actors and actresses as well.  Plot re-write, directing, casting, special effects, everything very well done.  I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie and will for many years to come.

6381428,4,B00JLV09S2,I enjoyed this movie.  It's basically the story of scrooge but has woman as scrooge.  If you enjoy movies and like the Christmas Carol.  I would suggest that you buy this version.,1361750400,2,179,4.53125
6381429,5,B00JLV09S2,"I originally saw this movie on Lifetime a few years ago, and loved the story.  A new twist on Scrooge, and we all know how many times that's been done......Susan Lucci is wonderful in this role!  I am a fan of her's from way back however;  Lucci added such a softness to her very hardened woman, LOVE HER!  Give this one a whirl, because I am certain that you will add it to your Holiday rotation of movies!  Buy it for someone else as a gift, they will love you for it!",1361145600,,470,4.065217391304348

6381433,5,B00JLV09S2,"A female scrooge story.  It is a great story and has a good message since we
are looking at a female as scrooge.  Makes one think and that is always a good
thing!",1359331200,,162,3.878787878787879
6381434,5,B00JLV09S2,The one network that ran it over the 2012 Christmas season edited certain scenes.  I'm very happy to own it,1359158400,,107,4.35

6381436,5,B00JLV09S2,Susan Luchi plays a female Scrooge and she does it very well. The movie is just like the first movie but in newer times. She is in charge of a large dept store & she runs it with a iron thumb. Her sisters child is a girl instead of a boy. Her helper is also a woman.,1358208000,,266,3.6842105263157894

6381438,5,B00JLV09S2,This is another movie that originally aired on Lifetime many years back and was shown every year at holiday time. It disappeared from the airwaves the last couple of years. Great version of the Dickens classic with the Scrooge character played by Susan Lucci. A must see for La Lucci fans. Great for the entire family.,1357862400,,318,4.696428571428571
6381439,3,B00JLV09S2,Ebbie's Story is the kind of movie I like to watch to put things in proper light.  Greed and power can be turned into something wonderful and give hope to the hopeless.,1357776000,,168,4.25
6381440,5,B00JLV09S2,I have been trying to find this on DVD for years.  Susan Lucci does a super job and it puts a new twist on an old classic...,1357257600,,124,3.5925925925925926

I'm glad it's finally on DVD as it's one of the Christmas movies I always look forward to watching.  We inserted the bonus CD by mistake and didn't get past the first song.

6381446,4,B00JLV09S2,"i saw this movie many years ago and had been looking for it on DVD for a long time. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon. it's a great version of A Christmas Carol. Susan Lucci plays ""Ebbie""  the female version of Ebenezer Scrooge. Its a nice change up from all the other versions of this beloved holiday classic. I definitely recommend it.",1357084800,,344,4.212121212121212
6381447,5,B00JLV09S2,I love to watch A Christmas Carol and this one was one of the first to have Scrooge be a woman.  I love it.,1357084800,,107,3.4583333333333335
6381448,4,B00JLV09S2,"This movie of yet another version of the classic tale A Christmas Carol is a must for all fans of La Lucci.  She was a perfect choice to play Elizabeth Scrooge (though she was a little long in the tooth to play her younger self but that's what gauze on the lens is for).  Though it may not be one's favorite re-telling of the story, it deserves it's place right up there w/A Diva's Christmas w/Vanessa Williams and all the many other remakes starring such celebrities as Kelsey Grammar, George C. Scott, Bill Murray and Cecily Tyson.  Though the supporting performances are a little questionable, this is not a movie one watches for perfection of interpretation of characterization.  It's Susan's movie and she does not disappoint.  The hilarious part is that she takes ""appointments"" from the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future in her silk pajamas and pumps.  She's a diva and divas are never w/o their high heels!",1357084800,2,925,4.75

6381451,5,B00JLV09S2,"I was first introduced to this movie on television.  Every year I would have to hunt to see which channel was going to be playing it.  And then there were a couple of years that it wasn't on at all.  I was so excited when I saw that you could finally purchase it on DVD. I knew the movie as just Ebbie- but this is it. It's the Christmas Carol with a female twist.
The bonus CD of Christmas music was a nice touch.  I gave it to my mom to play in her car during the holidays.",1356912000,,475,3.816326530612245
6381452,5,B00JLV09S2,Been waiting for this movie for years and it is about time it came out. One of my favorite to watch at Christmas.,1356739200,,113,3.9565217391304346
6381453,5,B00JLV09S2,"Lsst Christmas (2011) I e-mailed the Producer, Susan Lucci, Director, several other people to tell them how much my Husband and I loved this movie.  They all responded but there was nothing that they could do to have a DVD made so that the public could buy.  When I looked this year for other Christmas movies I was pleasantly surprised to see that EBBIE'S STORY was being sold as a DVD plus a Bonus CD.  We received the DVD 12/28/2012 and watched it that night with our meal.  The DVD is delightful and we are so happy to have it in our Christmas collection of DVD's.

6381456,5,B00JLV09S2,I love this one and always try to see it an Christmastime.  Now I can watch it whenever I want,1356566400,,94,3.7
6381457,3,B00JLV09S2,"For a female scrooge the main character did a really good job, and most of the acting was good. However some of the movie just didn't fit, like the two girl spirits who were dressed like call girls. The reviews were so good that I decided to take a chance, but If I had seen this movie first then I never would have ordered it.",1356480000,,327,4.046153846153846

Ive enjoyed watching it over and over already this Christmas season, esp since the networks chose not to air it this yr. So glad I made this purchase! Plus, the bonus Christmas music CD was beautiful.",1356307200,2,310,4.553571428571429

6381462,5,B00JLV09S2,"I remember watching this on TV with my mom every Christmas. It is such a great story with a nice twist on the scrooge story. It sets the story in a more modern day, with Miss Scrooge being the head of a large department store, and she only cares about one thing and that's making more money, and finding as many ways as she can to save more money. Like the other Christmas Carol movies she is visited by 3 spirits, who are very interesting to say the least. That's as far as I will go I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone.

It is really great to finally have this one on DVD..The image quality, in my opinion was rather good, alot better than my old recorded VHS copy. For a price like this you can't beat it.

You will absolutely love this movie and its guaranteed to become a Christmas tradition!",1356134400,2,803,4.174193548387096

Then, much to my dismay, they stopped showing it. Searched again this year and no results. Freaked out thinking my tradition was over. Alas, found it on Amazon. About time it was released on DVD. Don't know why it took so long. Susan Lucci is at her best! Can't judge the quality of the dvd yet, as I haven't watched it, but hope and pray it will work. As others have written, don't understand the generic cover on the outside case. Has nothing to do with the movie. All in all, a great version of the original. Worth watching year after year.

Now that it has been released I ordered two copies (one as a spare) because it was so heard to get.  Susan Lucci plays a department store owner who is so busy she forgets what Christmas is all about.  She has forgotten how much she cared for her former partner (now deceased) and so many other things.  It's been so long since I've seen it I forget all the details -- but this is my FAVORITE version of the Ebenezer Scrooge movie ever made.  It's just wonderful!!,1354320000,,592,4.149122807017544

Even it has English subtitles on but they did not show any English subtitles. Susan Lucci is one of my favorite actresses. I used to watch her television show ""All My Children"". Ebbie was one of my favorite Christmas movies. I was looking forward to watch it and found out that it did not have closed captioned or English subtitles which was degrading for me. I can not hear what the movie was talking about. Closed captioning or English subtitles are helpful for me and other deaf (hearing impaired) audiences to understand what movies are talking about its main story and plots. We are completely lost what the movie was talking about. I can not return DVD because it is already opened so I am stuck with it now. Others and I found it being a big time insult.

At first I wasn't sure if it was actually the same movie from the 90's that I remember just being called ""Ebbie."" This title is a little different and the cover is pretty generic, but the description of it sounded right so I took the chance and ordered it. When I got it, I was so excited to find that it was in fact the same beloved movie I watch every year at Christmas. The old copy I recorded from tv years ago was getting really worn, so this came out at the best time.
Susan Lucci is absolutely perfect in her role as Elizabeth ""Ebbie"" Scrooge, the ice cold owner of Dobson's department store who learns a much needed life lesson on Christmas Eve.  It's a great modern version of A Christmas Carol. The ""ghosts"" that visit Ebbie are actually some of her employees at Dobson's which I thought was great, although the two girls that work at the perfume counter and portray the ""past"" ghosts are kind of annoying in my opinion. I did like how their hair and outfits would change to reflect the different times in the past that they visited though.
 Highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Christmas movies. Although there are many different versions of this story, Ebbie is definitely worth watching ( and owning).
The bonus Christmas cd included was not impressive but this movie certainly is.",1353542400,4,1415,4.498054474708171

The 'chapter selection' reads ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"" ,""Chapter 3"", etc- but no pictures or titles to tell us at which point of the movie these chapters will lead too. The CD is just really unnecessary, and the movie itself does not look much better than if you recorded it on your DVR or even a VHS whenever it aired on TV. I gave it two stars because I really love this movie and was glad people decided to release it, no matter how lacking the release is, and it's cheap... but I advise people to, if you have it recorded or can find it online, to burn it to a disc yourself and buy a cheap case, because that's really all it is, and would cost less. I actually (with the help of my label maker) made new covers for the case&DVD with pictures from the actual movie, and quickly typed up where each chapter leads on a piece of paper to just stick in the case (like some DVDs actually come with). I also took the CD&it's holder out, it was easy enough.

Of course, it is quite different from the original in that Ebeneezer Scrooge is a Mrs. as opposed to a Mr., but do NOT let this stop you from watching this heartwarming version.

Sure, there are no extras or commentary and only a basic chapter search, but I couldn't care less. My main goal was to own a quality version of ""EBBIE"" on DVD, so I am very pleased. Besides, any facts you'd want to know about this movie are available online.
 Also, the CD of Christmas Music puts you in the spirit even more. I only wish they had Carol of the Bells, which is my favorite, but it's still a nice listen.
 Finally, just want to state I think this is the best female version of SCROOGE I've ever seen. The story is very heartwarming without any sugar-coating. I especially admire Lorena Gale's performance as the Ghost of Christmas ""Present"".
