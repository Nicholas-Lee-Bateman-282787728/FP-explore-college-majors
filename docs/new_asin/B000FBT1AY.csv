8120431,3,B000FBT1AY,"On Connait la Chanson/Same Old Song is more a Jean-Claude Bacri-Agnes Jaoui movie than an Alain Resnais one. It's very much one of their comedies of social manners, somewhat slower to start than usual and stymied by the unfortunate device of having the characters sing snatches of popular French songs to articulate their thoughts. An acknowledged nod to Dennis Potter (to whom the film is dedicated), it simply doesn't work here, and not just because the cast are hopeless at miming (at times they don't even bother to move their lips). Unfortunately, apart from a couple of instances, we never get complete songs - sometimes we don't even get complete verses - leaving it with a feeling of cinematic indigestion rather than charm or wit: if it had had the guts to go all out with the songs, it probably would have worked, but here it just seems half-hearted and badly thought out.

Which is a pity, because once the various wheels are set in motion, it's a very likeable comedy with a few good performances - particularly Andre Dussolier (wonderful as a radio playwright/estate agent), Bacri and, in one brief scene, the ever dependable Jean-Pierre Darrousain. Some of the misunderstandings and embarrassments are painfully true to life (not least a romance built on one character misunderstanding another's cold for emotion) and there's a real affection for the characters. Unfortunately some of the women veer towards stereotype: Sabine Azema always threatens to turn into one of those pantomime bourgeois parodies Mike Leigh is so fond of and it's becoming increasingly obvious that Jaoui simply creates variations on the same part for herself in all her scripts. But there's still a lot to like about the film even if the songs do keep on getting in the way.",1284076800,,1764,4.9393939393939394
