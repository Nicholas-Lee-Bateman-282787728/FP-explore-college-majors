2108415,5,B0002NY8FI,"Alright, yes, I am a big RFK fan.  But not necessarily a Kennedy fan.  That's right--it is actually possible to like an individual Kennedy without being a fanatic about the rest of them!  That said, I believe one should be able to see that this brief documentary stands on its own, however you feel about the family.  American Experience has shown time and time again, much like the Ken Burns documentaries on a smaller scale, how to showcase a mesmerizing personality.

What is particularly wonderful about this piece is how it follows the arc of Bobby Kennedy's changing belief system: what metamorphasized within him and what solidified. His most remarkable facet, to me, is that for a politician, and one with a reputation for bull-headedness at that, he was not afraid to change his mind, to learn from life and rethink former convictions.  It shows a man on a journey within himself,taking a large part of an equally changing country with him until his sudden end.

Agree with his politics or not, Bobby Kennedy was an intelligent, philosophical and driven man.  American Experience has once again told an interesting story about an interesting person, and isn't that the best sort of entertainment?",1110326400,6,1205,4.930693069306931
2108416,4,B0002NY8FI,"Sorry, folks, I am NOT a Kennedy hater, and I find the way in which Robert Kennedy's personal and public lives interact make him  one of the most interesting of the family. I have to agree with chefdevergue, though, whose review is more sophisticated than is painted.

The good things about this film include the footage, the commited nature of the narration, the amount of time given to one person's life.

BUT

that person's complexity seems to be submerged in the Robert Kennedy cult (does everyone have to cry?) in which a nasty little man is transformed by his brother's death to bring out his human side. In doing so, he becomes hip-60's humanist-cum-revolutionary who could have healed the nation.

I am sure this is partly true. The United States seems to have begun a serious drift to a mean conservatism after about 1966, yet Bobby Kennedy stood out against it. He must have been aware that he was unlikely to be elected president in 1968; primaries did not count for so much those days, his primary victories hardly indicated a popular surge for his brand of radicalism, a demoralising defeat waited for him in New York on 18th June, and Humphrey was tying up the nomination at boss-dominated state conventions. Yet he stood out against this, appointed a radical staff and put his neck out on unpopular issues.

However, the bad Bobby wasn't looked at by this hagiography. He didn't stop being the cool calculating politician in 1963; he couldn't have survived if he had. His awareness and respect for the cold power-politics within the Democratic Party are not really dealt with here (compared with the other and superior PBS documentary, The Kennedys. which had the brilliant historian Alan Brinkley as its consultant); his ruthlessness in pursuing the obvious belief that the family had a right to the White House is quietly buried here - eg his attempt to force his way into William Manchester's hotel room in 1966 to stop Manchester attacking LBJ in 'Death of a President', because at the time Bobby was still hoping to be LBJ's running mate); the tv debate with McCarthy in the California primary wasn't shown, yet here RFK was not so nice or such a humanist - waving the big stick over law 'n order, making dark hints that black people would be invading white neighbourhoods if McCarthy had his way. Not nice, and not fitting in with the cult myth that this documentary promulgates, but an attempt to expand his base to white working-class non-radicals who were needed for victory, in California aand nationally. Perhaps if Bobby had won..things may not have been so radical after all?

So sorry folks, and I repeat I am not a Kennedy hater; they are a flawed family, but one which rightly captures the breath of anyone interested in public life, and one which has bravely held steadfast to the banner of liberalism in a conservative age. The Bobby myth has some strong points in its favour; he really does seem to be a passionate idealist in many ways, but this movie does not give a balanced assessment of this fascinating man.",1103500800,5,3047,4.759469696969697
2108417,5,B0002NY8FI,I watched this when it was on PBS last month and thought it was one of the best documentaries I've seen.  It left me wondering what happened to politicians like RFK.  Why are we consistently stuck with less than stellar candidates for the most important job in the world?,1099440000,7,271,4.510204081632653
2108418,5,B0002NY8FI,"I have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding Robert Kennedy, and I've got to say that this is, by far, one of the best pieces of work I've yet to see.  The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America.

This movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy's life.

If you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it.  This is THE one you want to watch.  After watching this, you will see Robert Kennedy in a way you never have before.",1097971200,47,891,4.685897435897436
2108419,5,B0002NY8FI,"Reading the chefdevergue review, I'm compelled to ask ""How does one get to be a top 1000 reviewer? Should I use more $5 words like 'hagiography'?""

Reading his review, all I can glean is that he hates the Kennedys. Perhaps I'm wrong about this, but I don't understand why he can't distinguish between the deeds of the father and the son, done almost 40 years apart, in measuring the character of Robert Kennedy. I, for one, would not feel it fair if one judged me based on the career and deeds of my father. Or my mother, for that matter.

There's a simple rule of thumb to be followed for all of biographical film: when you really want the scoop, if you desire detail and nuance, read the book. Film doesn't have the time to get into great detail, to be thorough or even fair. All we can hope for from a film is that it will make us feel, it will move or inspire us, or it will, at the very least, entertain us. If the film is of acceptable quality, it will not lie to us, either to glamorize or condemn its subject. If it does not lie but still glamorizes or condemns, the author's message is clear, and often valid.

This film is about power of loss, how it has the strength to move us to greater wisdom and accomplishment. Director David Grubin, who has directed many powerful documentaries for ""The American Experience"" over the past several years, communicates this message thoughtfully and movingly. I would suspect that even chef would agree with me that JFK's death did have a powerful and positive effect on the rough-edged RFK. Grubin effectively tells the story of RFK to make that case.

This film will resonate with anyone who has suffered a terrible loss.

I have to admit I don't shed a lot of tears at the movies, but I did cry within the first five minutes of this film, as the conventioneers cheered him at the 1964 democratic convention, and he quoted ""Romeo and Juliet.""

The rest of it, the biographical information about RFK, his bullying and controlling pre-1964 period is, in my opinion, covered much better than chef would lead you to believe. If you are into politics, history, or the 1960s, you will be entertained by the conflict between RFK and LBJ and the way Grubin covers this. But the theme of this film is not that.

I can't discuss this film without mentioning the contribution of Michael Bacon's score. The haunting theme of this, as well as his music for Grubin's 1991 masterpiece ""LBJ"" make me wonder why we don't have the opportunity to purchase (or even download) the scores for these films. Amazon?

If you are one of those republican-types who feels compelled to trash the Kennedy legacy at every opportunity, take your comfort in chef's review. I don't, so I recommend this film.",1097971200,14,2723,4.554192229038855
2108420,3,B0002NY8FI,"I really would have expected better from the people producing the ""American Experience.""  The many and varied complexities of RFK's personality --- some might call them contradictions --- offer a wealth of material for discussion, but most of this is largely skimmed over in favor of a sympathetic treatment that at times verges on hagiography.

Certainly RFK, especially between 1960 and his death in 1968, experienced a transformation in character.  The arrogant henchman in the Kennedy political machine was clearly moving beyond his traditional cultural boundaries when he died, but how did this transformation come about?  Just how obnoxious of a punk he was (and there were very very good reasons that LBJ absolutely hated his guts --- LBJ was hardly alone in this) really is not explored much at all.  This program really does not address to my satisfaction how he moved past his obnoxious personality to become a much more deep and reflective individual.

Nor does the program even begin to discuss the inherent contradictions within the man.  For example, the young gungho Senate lawyer who doggedly pursued the links between organized labor & organized crime owed his status to a paternal fortune that was at least in part built on bootlegging and other ventures connected with organized crime.  In a rather galling moment, the narrator states that ""some people say"" that Joe Kennedy Sr. was involved in bootlegging.  No --- it isn't just ""some people"" saying this, it is virtually everyone saying this, and a lot more.  Joe Kennedy Sr. was up to his eyeballs in illicit and possibly illegal business activities, and was also thought by many to be a Nazi sympathizer (which cost him his posting at the Court of St. James).  Yet RFK built his whole reputation in Washington on being a ferocious crime buster --- does nobody else see the inherent contradictions here?

One can also look at his tenure as Attorney General and wonder why some issues were not discussed in more detail.  Here is a man whose primary responsibility was upholding the Constitution, and yet he endorsed illegal wiretapping and what amounts to terrorist activities (I don't know what else one would call trying to assassinate a head of state).  By 1967, he was seriously (and genuinely I believe) questioning the morality of US involvement in Viet Nam.  That is one hell of a leap.  Morality rarely, if ever, entered into the equation when RFK was making decisions as AG.  Really, how did this come to pass?  The program only skims the surface.

Thankfully, the program largely avoided the ""what if"" style of history that I find so irritating, although the producers seem to assume that RFK would have beaten Nixon in 1968.  They also shy away from stating that he would have been a great President, which is highly questionable, since he always remained a pretty arrogant, impatient individual who did not easily reach consensus on issues.  Mostly, the producers leave those questions unasked, which is probably the best thing to do.

Unfortunately, there are very few penetrating questions being asked or answered through this whole program.  At the end of the story, I felt that I was offered very little insight into a complex and intriguing individual.",1096934400,15,3240,4.981412639405204
2108421,5,B0002NY8FI,"This was a great documentary about a great man. Highly recommended if you are interested in the story of RFK. This documentary centers around the 1960's and his role in the JFK Administration, its tragic aftermath and his subsequent transformation, and finally the untimely assasination on the cusp of victory. An amazing story.

More importantly, the undertone of this documentary deals with RFK's growth on a personal level, as a man, and as a leader of men. It offers insight on how specific events influenced RFK to his moral core, and how he was transformed by them.

Many topics are explored: the Bay of Pigs, RFK and LBJ's relationship, Henry Hoover and JFK, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Civil Rights, JFK's assasination, RFK the Senator, and his bid for the Presidency.

RFK's final trip to California in handled very eloquently, and it was amazing to see how much RFK meant to people of all colors.

The story is told through photographs, film, and excellent narration, and is very tastefully done. This is a story of RFK, but this is also the story of the transformation of a man by events.",1096934400,5,1097,4.788359788359788
2108432,4,B0002NY8FI,"This is one of the good videos that gives a real, honest and accurate short look at Robert F. Kennedy.  It just brushes over the highlights of his life but enough to get a since of who he was and who he was becoming and where it might have led if he was not stripped from this earth.  Had some good footage and good accounts from people who were there and lived it. Great photos and footage of the two borthers before and during the presidency.  Would be great to add to a Kennedy collection or anyone wanting to know more about RFK and the era or for anyone who wonders what could have been.",1289779200,,592,4.130434782608695
2108433,5,B0002NY8FI,"It is somewhat ironic that at just the time that when presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, a recent addition to the Democratic Party pantheon of heroes and heir apparent to the Kennedy legacy, is claiming the nomination of the party that the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy during the presidential campaign of 1968 is being remembered in some quarters. That event holds much meaning in the political evolution of this writer. The Robert Kennedy campaign of 1968 was the last time that this writer had a serious desire to fight solely on the parliamentary road for progressive political change. So today he too has some remembrances, as well. This documentary from the Public Broadcasting System's American Experience series only adds some visual flashes to those remembrances.

In a commentary in another space I have mentioned that through the tumultuous period leading to the early spring of 1968 that I had done some political somersaults as a result of Bobby Kennedy's early refusal to take on a sitting president, Lyndon Johnson, for the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Moreover, I committed myself early (sometime in late 1967) to the reelection of Lyndon Johnson, as much as I hated his Vietnam War policy. Why? One Richard M. Nixon. I did not give Eugene McCarthy's insurgent campaign even a sniff, although I agreed with his anti-war stance. Why? He could not beat one Richard M. Nixon. When Bobby Kennedy jumped in and Johnson announced that he was not going to run again and I was there the next day. I was a senior in college at the time but I believe I spent hundreds of hours that spring working the campaign either out of Boston, Washington, D.C. or elsewhere. Why? Well, you can guess the obvious by now. He COULD beat one Richard M. Nixon.

It was more than that though, and I will mention more on that below. I took, as many did, his murder hard. It is rather facile now to say that something of my youth, and that of others who I have talked to recently about this event, got left behind with his murder but there you have it. However, to show you the kind of political year that it was for me about a week after his death I was in the Hubert Humphrey campaign office in Boston. Why? You know why by now. And for those who don't it had one name- Richard M. Nixon.

But let us get back to that other, more virtuous, political motive for supporting Bobby Kennedy. It was always, in those days, complicated coming from Massachusetts to separate out the whirlwind effect that the Kennedy family had on us, especially on `shanty' Irish families. On the one hand we wished one of our own well, especially against the WASPs, on the other there was always that innate bitterness (jealousy, if you will) that it was not we who were the ones that were getting ahead. If there is any Irish in your family you know what I am talking about.

To be sure, as a fourteen year old I walked the neighborhood for John Kennedy in 1960 but as I have mentioned elsewhere that was a pro forma thing. Part of the ritual of entry into presidential politics. The Bobby thing was from the heart. Why? It is hard to explain but there was something about the deeply felt sense of Irish fatalism that he projected, especially after the death of his brother, that attracted me to him. But also the ruthless side where he was willing to cut Mayor Daly and every politician like him down or pat them on the back and more, if necessary, to get a little rough justice in the world. In those days I held those qualities, especially in tandem, in high esteem. Hell, I still do, if on a narrower basis.

Okay, that is enough for a trip down memory lane back to the old politically nave days, or rather opportunistic days. Without detailing the events here the end of 1968 was also a watershed year for changing my belief that an individual candidate rather than ideas and political program were decisive for political organizing. That understanding, furthermore, changed my political appreciation for Bobby Kennedy (and the vices and virtues of the Democratic Party). That is the import of this well-produced (as always) portrayal of the short life and career of Robert Kennedy. If in 1968, with my 1968 political understandings, I stood shoulder to shoulder with Robert Kennedy my political evolution and his political past, as detailed here, changed my perceptions dramatically.

This documentary highlights the close relationship between Robert and his older brother John starting with the Massachusetts United States Senate campaign in 1952 (and that would continue in the 1960 campaign and during John Kennedy's administration right up to the assassination). We are presented here, however, with the `bad' Bobby who was more than willing to join Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""red scare"" anti-communist campaign and the anti-labor McClellan Committee campaigns against Jimmy Hoffa in particular. There is no love lost between this writer and labor bureaucrats like Hoffa (or his son) but a bedrock position then and today is the need for labor to clean its own house. What purpose does government intervention into the labor movement do except to weaken it? Bobby was on the other side on this one.

Under the John Kennedy Administration Robert, moreover, played a key role in putting a damper on the early civil rights movement in the South (as well as putting a 'tap' on Martin Luther King at the behest of one J. Edgar Hoover), the Bay of Pigs decision and aftermath , the Cuban Missile Crisis confrontation with the Soviet Union and the early escalation, under the rubric of counter-insurgency, in Vietnam. As readily observable, where I had previously downplayed my opposition to some of Bobby's positions I now put a big minus next to it. That is politics.

Finally though, I will frankly admit a lingering `softness' for Bobby. Why? The late political journalist Jack Newfield, one of the inevitable 'talking heads' that people PBS productions, a biographer of Robert Kennedy I believe but in any case a close companion in the mid-1960's and a prior resident of the Bedford- Stuveysant ghetto of New York City, made this comment about a Robert Kennedy response to his question during a tour of that area. Newfield asked Kennedy what he would have become if he had grown up in Bedford-Stuveysant. Bobby responded quickly- ""I would either be a juvenile delinquent or a revolutionary"". I would like to think that he meant those alternatives seriously. Enough said.",1213747200,4,6520,4.825581395348837
2108434,5,B0002NY8FI,"This should be required viewing in high-school classrooms.  It really seems to capture....as best as can be done in two hours who RFK was and even more so, because of his own personal tragedy and pain, what he had grown into.

If his life had ended in November 1963, then that would have left us with a story of someone who was just another talented, power-driven, and even ruthless politician.  But it did not.  And because of his brother's death, we are presented with Part 2 of his life....""The Awful Grace of God"" where ""in agony, he learned wisdom"" and became a different person.

This film shows some incredible, almost surreal moments of the 60's particularly 1968.  One that stands out and really shows this man's character was the often quoted speech in Indianapolis where he had to tell hundreds of black, hurting people that Martin Luther King was killed.  Raw courage.  Quoting Aeschylus to them the way he did.  Just amazing to watch.

You really don't have to be an RFK ""fan"" to get something from this.  I think if you're just a fan of humanity and how one person can make a difference in their world and grow and change.  And with respect to the reviewer who didn't like this because they didn't interview his detractor's....would it really have mattered if they could have gotten the thoughts or comments of LBJ, Nixon, Jimmy Hoffa, or J Edger Hoover?",1202601600,4,1368,4.654166666666667

2108437,5,B0002NY8FI,"Having read one biography already on Robert F. Kennedy and searching relentlessly on the internet for information regarding this man, I already had some good knowledge on RFK before watching this American Experience episode. I was very surprised, although the documentary did state some things I had known previously from reading, the DVD provides more insight into the strained relationship between LBJ and RFK. The archival footage of the Senate Rackets Committee and home movies from Hickory Hill added an authentic touch to the documentary, giving the life of RFK a new light. I was also pleased that they didn't spend too much time on his childhood, but just enough to highlight his traits that would carry with him throughout his life. Overall, American Experience: RFK is a great film for anyone who wants to know the basics of Bobby Kennedy and his ever-changing life. It mentions almost every major event in RFK's career and personal life, as well. From the Civil Rights Crisis to the death of his brother and to his own candidacy for the Presidency.

The DVD is very heavily b&w and my 13 y.o was not really looking forward to watching it, but the PBS team does a good job of showing the human side of RFK, even in ""old black and white"". And of course as he gets older the clips turn to color film. I had forgotten what a rock star Bobby was in those days. He was like the Beatles, filling stadiums with people screaming for him. I guess America really wanted him to fill his brother's shoes. And the narrator is explaining all this and then, boom, you know what happens next. It was just shocking for my kids, who came to understand the 60s so much more after seeing this DVD with me. Get it and sit and watch it with your teens.",1143331200,12,729,4.0

But these events are pale in comparison to the Bobby Kennedy that is presented here.  It is honest in that it doesn't try to gloss over the much harder and meaner Bobby who existed prior to November 22, 1963.

2108441,4,B0002NY8FI,"Next to ""RFK in His Own Words"" (not yet on DVD, sadly), this is the best documentary on RFK that is out there at the present time.  Covers most of the major issues (although the Cuban Missle Crisis segment is a tad too short and it doesn't include his classic South African Speech of 1966 which challenged young people around the world). Hopefully in the future, the latter could be included as a special feature.

But what it has is good. Along with the necessary biographical info, we see an all-too-brief segment on his moving speech at the 1964 Democratinc convention where he paid tribute to his brother. There is also an ultra-rare 1967 ""Meet the Press"" episode (the wear and age is shown on the videotape) where he pointedly asks his hosts (on his waffling on Vietnam and a 1968 run), ""What would you rather me do? Get off the earth?"" one could only picture say Howard Dean speaking with that kind of unscripted candor today.

We also see amazing footage of RFK calming the Indianapolis ghetto after MLK's murder (this has been seen before, but not in this much detail), and frantic scenes of his connecting with the residents of Chinatown and Watts. The Chinatown segment shows a previously unseen shot of a temporary scare in the RFK motorcade when fireworks are set off-ironically, he was killed that very night!

Overall, a must see. The features have some good commentary from RFK's associates too. D.W. Griffith once said that one day, film might replace history books in classrooms. I would not want to see that happen, but films like this do a mightly good job!",1123545600,14,1576,4.67870036101083

8029783,5,B0002NY8FI,"The PBS series ""American Experience"" has a well known reputation for quality documentaries for many years now. One of the best examples of that quality would be their biography of Robert Kennedy. Younger brother of President John Kennedy who would dedicate much of his life working and helping his brother first to get elected to the U. S. senate for Massachusetts and then help John make it to the White House.

""RFK"" is a two hour look into that life with the first hour showing Bobby growing up as a young boy in the Kennedy family and how he tried to get his father's attention and acceptance to getting his degree in law from Harvard to becoming involved with taking on organized crime and the unions, particularly Jimmy Hoffa, to John's campaign manager to becoming the Attorney General of the United States after his brother's election to the presidency. You see during this time just how much Bobby admired and dedicated his life to his brother and how John came to trust Bobby's opinion and counsel on important matters whether the civil rights movement or especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The first part ends with the assassination of President Kennedy.

Part two looks at how Bobby went through his grieving over the death of his brother and how after being so long willfully in the shadow of his brother Bobby now had to find his own place in the world. It would take a little time but Bobby indeed would come into his own and find his place in politics and a voice that would speak for millions who were either among the minority or poor or powerless or all three. In Bobby Kennedy many people found hope there was someone who would listen to them and understand their plight and would help those Americans who had no voice in politics. It also looks at the internal struggles Bobby was going through in deciding if he should run for President. Finally it looks at the political fight Bobby would get into once he announced he was running for President. And then it looks at that night in Los Angeles after his victory in the California primary when a man with a gun would bring crashing down all the hopes and dreams of Americans everywhere.

For anyone old enough to remember the Kennedy's or the '60s this is a great documentary to watch and remember what had occurred. For those younger this is an excellent documentary to watch. To not just watch historical events that would unfold during that time but to also see how one person could rally a nation, to inspire a generation and to stir hope in an individuals heart all without any profit or gain in anyway or for ego. Robert Kennedy is of the likes we will never see again I fear but at least with this ""American Experience"" documentary we will never forget.",1409616000,,2740,4.59918200408998

In that film, the life of Robert Kennedy was only a subset of the larger subject of his family including his father and older brother who was elected President of the United States. Thus, upon seeing that there was a separate film focusing strictly on RFK, I assumed that a lot of new information would be presented to the public about him. I was suprised to see that this was not the case, in fact, important issues that were discussed in the earlier that showed RFK in a less than positive life were omitted entirely in this later film.
Little is shown about RFK's life as a child, how his father's personality and both positive (wealthy, loving parent) and negative traits (philanderer, partner with the Mafia, ruthless businessman,  political reactionary and pro-Nazi antisemite) impacted on RFK and helped mold his personality.  RFK, as a cub reporter in 1946, made a visit to British Palestine and he met leaders of the Jewish Underground conducting an uprising against British rule there and, perhaps surprisingly, considering his family's antisemitism, wrote sypathetic articles about the Jewish fighters for his Boston newspaper. Was this because he had begun to distance himself from his father's prejudices, or simply, as an Irish-American was he automatically on the side of anyone who was fighting against Britain? None of this is mentioned in this film. Nor is mentioned his relationship with his sister Kathleen who defied their devout Catholic mother and married a Protestant and was on her way to marrying another after being widowed in the war when she was killed in a plane crash. It is stated that Bobby was among the most pious of the Kennedy children so how would he react to these crises? Again, none of this is mentioned (although he did name his oldest daughter after Kathleen, so he must of had some found memories of her).
  Going into the 1950's, this later film does point out something not mentioned in the earlier one which is that RFK had a violent temper and that he would get into fist fights with people. He also was a physically violent person and people would be injured in the ""friendly"" Kennedyesque touch football games held at his home.  Normally, someone who had reached this age and acted in such a mannter would be considered a thug, but somehow RFK eluded this image. Similarly, he and his brother JFK managed to avoid being tainted by their friendship with red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy.
  Neither film points out that RFK, as his brother's campaign manager, ordered people to pay bribes for votes and to have campaign workers play dirty tricks on the opposition, something people working for Nixon's 1972 election campaign went to jail for.
  Although both films point out Attorney-General Robert Kennedy's management of ""Operation Mongoose""...the attempt by the CIA to oust Cuban leader Fidel Castro by any means possible, they both claim that it isn't certain that RFK  and JFK knew that Mafia hit-men were being recruited to try to assassination Castro. This is preposterous...RFK was a micromanager and certainly knew what was going on, and if he knew, then JFK knew.  This leads us to what I view as the major failing of both films....the failure to properly investigate the reasons for RFK's severe depression after JFK's assassination which lasted a long time. Everyone noticed that he was much more negatively affected than other members of the family. Those who are admirers of RFK, including those who made these two films refuse to face the REASON for RFK's severe depression. It wasn't just sadness or mourning....it was the belief that RFK felt RESPONSIBLE for the assassination. This is because American attempts to kill Castro were reported in the media and Lee Oswald, being a fanatical admirer of Castro was aware of them. Castro himself stated publicly that he was aware of these attempts and that they could boomerang back on the US. Oswald felt he was doing Castro a favor (he was trying to go to Cuba in the period before the assassination) by killing the President. It was knowledge of this and that he, RFK, had been behind these threats against Castro that was tormenting him (historian Max Holland discusses this on a JFK assassination web site maintained by John McAdams).  Pro-Kennedy historians and film makers are afraid to touch this hot potato so we are not told about this.
  Moving on to RFK's campaign for the Senate seat in New York in 1964, both films point out that RFK was a poor campaigner, but this film fails to mention that RFK was not liked there because he was viewed as a carpetbagger who came from out of state and that he wasn't really interested in serving in the Senate and merely viewed it as a stepping stone to the Kennedy's regaining the Throne in the White House, and finally, because New York's large Jewish community didn't trust anyone from antisemite Joe Kennedy's family. In the end, RFK won narrowly, carried in by LBJ coat-tails which won for him a large majority in the same state.
  It should be noted that this second film does show the dilemma RFK faced with the War in Vietnam, and his and his brother's role in getting the US involved there.
Although the anti-war Democrats had been pressing RFK to run against President Johnson, he decided not to, saying he supported Johnson's re-election until the other anti-war candidate, Senator Eugene McCarthy did better than expected in the New Hampshire Primary (the second film fails to mention that actually Johnson WON the New Hampshire vote, but by a smaller than expected margin, and that many who voted for McCarthy did it as a protest at Johnson's lack of a tough response to the recent Communist Tet Offensive, not because they wanted an immediate American pull-out).  This graceless turnabout and his failure to co-ordinate with McCarthy left a bad taste in many people's mouths and McCarthy never forgave him for it.
As soon as RFK entered the race, he started attacking LBJ in tones that many reporters viewed as demagogic, just short of accusing LBJ of being a war criminal, whereas just a few weeks earlier his criticism of the war had been far more muted.  This is pointed out in the first film, but not in the second. It was also pointed out that that he did not campaign very well, but only in the first film.  However, it must be admitted even by people who are not RFK-fans that his off-cuff words told to a largely black audience in Indianapolis on the night after Martin Luther King's assassination were masterful and heartfelt when he told them not to hate all white people because of what happened.
  Finally, after the tragic denoument of the story, the first film, but not the second,  has former Kennedy aide Richard Goodwin stating that he wasn't sure how successful RFK would have been as President (Goodwin appears in both films). On the one hand, he was charismatic and a veteral political operator, but his adoption of a very liberal program that appealed to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities  and the poor in general (although he didn't approve of welfare) might not have gone over well with those Richard Nixon called ""The Silent Majority"" who were frightened by black militancy, the ongoing violence and rioting in the major cities and college campuses and a conservative coalition could have gelled that would have blocked RFK's domestic program. Similarly, it was easier for Richard Nixon, a veteran cold-warrior, to make the breakthroughs in detente with the USSR and Communist China that allowed him to carry out the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam without being accused of ""selling out"" and American ally.
  In summary, I would say the film is worth watching, especially by someone who is not familiar with American history of the 1960's, but it doesn't break new ground over what was known before.",1335139200,2,7938,4.866567828020756
