A must have for all Europe fans.",1386374400,2,164,4.466666666666667
5934908,5,B00ERH13J4,"I took a chance on this the other day seeing is ""used"" at my local Second Spin store and am i glad!!  I guess what pushed me over the top (since I'm not familiar with the band) was that Scott Gorham (Thin Lizzy , Black Star Riders) and Michael Schenker were guest stars.

First off.. it is NOT 1:33 as Amazon.com states it is WIDESCREEN 1:78 and it is NOT 90 minutes... The concert is almost 2 and a half hours and there is another 20 minutes of bonus features so its much closer to 180 Minutes...

When rating a product I go by  value and quality.  Firstly this is a tremendous value, a nearly 30 song set of over 2 hours in a world where artists like Aerosmith are releasing BRs closer to only 1 hour...  so a full show gets my vote. Its very well filmed and a very fun show .... another vote... and cool bonus features.

I'm now a fan of this band and a big fan of this BR.  If you are a fan you will be happy and it also comes with a nice booklet.... true value for money.",1386201600,8,976,3.9692307692307693
5934909,5,B00ERH13J4,"If you want over two hours of fantastic rock and roll in a visually exciting concert to see and hear, then you should buy this DVD Bluray!  This band is as hard rocking as they come with wonderful melodic rock songs. They are so underrated especially in America because their biggest hit was The Final Countdown back in the eighties, which was a great song, but not at all representative of their vast catalog of music. We need this band to come and tour America again and hopefully people seeing what a stunning live show they put on will create the demand again.",1384560000,4,564,4.475728155339806
5934910,5,B00ERH13J4,"First of all this concert was shot in Solvesborg, Sweden in June of 2013 during the Sweden Rock Festival!

I had the pleasure of being one of those 30,000 people who attended the anniversary show in Sweden this past summer.  It was an amazing show to see in person and to be a part of.  Europe is truly a great rock band!  Europe delivered on their promise of this show being memorable and not like any of their other shows.  This high energy event was a full two hours, songs from all 9 albums were played  including some songs they haven't played in years, and appearances from specials guests (Gorham and Schenker).  Rarely heard from songs like Girl From Lebanon and Prisoners In Paradise made the set, as well as, new material like Firebox and The Beast.  What would the night out be without old favorites like Seven Doors Hotel, Rock The Night and The Final Countdown.

Joey Tempest was everywhere with his boundless energy, keeping the momentum riding high the entire night.  John Leven kept the heartbeat of the band strong and steady.  Ian Haugland laid the road work for the bands rhythmic drive.  Master guitarist John Norum hammered in all the metal.  And lastly Mic Michaeli wove all the color into the music.  Together Europe created one electric event for all their fans around the world.

Patric Ullaeus of Revolver Films, Sweden and crew did a fabulous job of capturing this concert for DVD.  The DVD extras give you a glimpse of the preshow via photos and footage.  And Europe even takes the time to conduct post-concert interview.  Europe Live At Sweden Rock is a beautifully packaged tribute with great footage, color, and sound to the hardest working band from Scandinavia.",1384128000,10,1694,4.723549488054608
5934911,5,B00ERH13J4,"Your description is wrong! This DVD/Blue Ray was filmed at Sweden Rock Festival, Solsborg, Sweden  June 7th 2013 by Patric Ullaeus.  If you could please change it and give the proper credit it would be awesome!! True fans know where and when it was filmed! They may mistake this to be the Live At Shephards Bush which was recorded in 2011.",1379376000,22,339,4.540983606557377

5934919,5,B00ERH13J4,After 30 years and a hiatus these guys still know how to rock. I am and always was a big Europe fan. This was a high energy concert that was amazing. Their music is not for everyone. If your not sure if you will like them then look them up on YouTube or something and listen first. If your a fan then you will love it like I do.,1422057600,,328,3.7681159420289854

5934927,4,B00ERH13J4,I wasn't sure what I was gonna get here but I was very surprised. Didn't know several of the songs but liked most of them. The guest appearance of Michael Schenker was quite possibly the highlight of the show. Plus I don't know who listed this at 90 minutes but its a full 2 hour show. If you ever considered yourself a Europe fan then get this and enjoy>,1392595200,,355,4.159420289855072
5934928,4,B00ERH13J4,I prefer the 2 cd's after Countdown. They barely played any songs from Out of This World or Prisoners in Paradise. The band sounds good. Good musicianship and vocals. Worth checking out if your a 80s hard rock fan.,1390262400,,214,4.512820512820513
5934929,5,B00ERH13J4,"Of all the dvds that Europe has done this is the best one. The stage, the lightning , the songs and the guests made this one a classic. One of the high points was when they did a song with Michael Schenker. Awesome",1388880000,,214,4.0
5934930,5,B00ERH13J4,"I bought this 'Live at Sweden Rock: 30th Anniversary Show' DVD in November 2013 and watched this DVD over five times for past one month. It is a great DVD which video is good and sound is perfect. All members, Joey Tempest(vocals), John Norum(guitars), John Levn(bass), Mic Michaeli(keyboards), Ian Haugland(drums) performed in their top form. Recommend to purchase this DVD or Blu-ray as you can enjoy their all-time hits.

8608674,4,B00ERH13J4,"Playing MGS The Phantom Pain recently, I've been waxing nostalgic with all the classic 80's tunes in the game, including Europe's Final Countdown.  Seeing the band had a concert release on Blu-ray, I rushed to order it.  I've never heard Europe in concert before, though I've still got one or more tapes or CDs of theirs from the 80's lying around, assuming I didn't wear it out playing it back then.  But it's been a while since I've heard the band.  This is a solid performance with a lot of energy.  I wouldn't say they've improved with age, as others have, assuming their older recordings weren't helped out in mixing - again, I've never heard them live.  My only disappointment was that they saved Final Countdown for last when you could tell the lead's voice was starting to waver.  He really likes to play to the camera a lot in the concert and is extremely energetic, as if he's trying to put on a performance that'll be remembered for posterity.

The video is also sound.  Good quality HD, with a number of interesting extras.  My only disappointment with the disc comes from knowing that the international releases of this concert all claim lossless DTS HD 5.1 Master Audio.  For multi-channel surround, the US release only supports legacy, lossy Dolby Digital 5.1.  It's saving grace is that the 2-channel mix - which 2-channel is typically more faithful to the actual recording for most concert performances - is uncompressed lossless PCM and a dramatic improvement in tonal fidelity to the muddy DD 5.1 remix.  Still, those who think stereo to be innately inferior to 6-channel AC3 will no doubt be disappointed that the surround mix isn't lossless.  Though, I haven't heard any of the imports to be able to say whether the muddied fidelity is a by product of the lower quality DD codec or of the remix itself.  And unfortunately, the foreign releases are all reportedly 50i and thus incompatible with typical US displays in terms of video.  The only advice I can offer those who really want high quality sound and a surround experience is to try using Prologic or similar processing with this concerts 2-channel LPCM mix.  Or better yet, get one of Yamaha's higher end AVRs that supports all their amazing music DSPs.  In my experience, unlike every other AVR manufacturer I've owned or used (Denon, Marantz, Sony, Pioneer), Yamaha's DSPs are actually really impressive, for music - much more so than Denon's 5-channel stereo, which many audiophiles seem content with.",1498176000,,2482,4.8274231678487

If you think Europe is just a one or two hit ballad songs wonder, you couldn't be more wrong.

The Grammy's are really just a popularity contest but these guys don't need an award.  They still fill stadiums and sound as good or better than ever.",1470182400,,374,4.3768115942028984
