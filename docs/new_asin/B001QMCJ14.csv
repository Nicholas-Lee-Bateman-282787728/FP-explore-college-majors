3766061,5,B001QMCJ14,"Just got my hands a screener for this film and let me just say this; you need to see this movie! Kim Basinger reminded me of why she is one of the best actresses of the last 20 years. I would recommend this movie to anyway who enjoys an on the edge of your seat thriller where a women takes her life into her own hands. Some of the kill scenes are some of the best I have seen in a while, including one where Kim Basinger kills one of the thugs using a tire iron. I can't wait to get my hands on the actually DVD of this film and I suggest you check it out as well.",1237507200,3,565,3.7563025210084033
3766062,5,B001QMCJ14,"In the midst of my daily online surfing (precious time that should probably be spent completing the tasks assigned to me by my employer) I stumbled across an article about the forthcoming LOTR prequel The Hobbit. Being the sucker for hyperlinked names that I am, I clicked on Guillermo Del Toro (the auteur behind the new, soon-to-be mega smash hit) and low-and-behold I was whisked away to the magical paradise we know as IMDB.  While reading his seemingly endless list of producer/director/special thanks credits, I realized something: my understanding of GDT's work is, to say the very least, limited.  There were so many films listed that either I hadn't heard of, or have never seen.  With little hesitation, and even less regard for my job responsibilities, I clicked on the most recent of the otherwise ""unbeknownst to me"" films, titled While She Was Out.  Two things stuck out at me right away: Kim Basinger (whose body is ingrained in my head from my countless repeat viewings of 9  weeks via Encore on Demand) was the star, and Don Murphy (Natural Born Killers, Transformers) was the top listed Producer. ...needless to say, I was intrigued.

As I continued to read about the film, the more and more I wanted to see it.  It literally has so much going for it, including the participation of three veritable living legends (Murphy, Del Toro, Basinger).  The synopsis made it sound like a gritty thriller in the vein of I spit on your Grave, Death Wish and Kill Bill (and as a side bar, for those of you who haven't seen these movies, stop reading and go to Blockbuster immediately).  I noticed it was rated R, which is definitely a plus.  I hate network television for the same reason I hate PG13--an inevitable stifling of creativity.  When is the last time you actually heard someone replace the word sh! t, with shoot in real life?  So when I found out it was playing in a theater down the street from my house, I thought to myself,  ""congratulations filmmakers, you my friends just earned my $10 ($7.50 for the ticket and $2.50 for Gobstoppers)"".

The basic plot is as follows:

Kim's character has two kids, a beautiful house, and a verbally abusive husband (probably physically abusive as well, but this is more of a deduction than a fact).  It's Christmas Eve, and she needs to finish some last minute shopping.  She Goes to the Mall.  She can't find parking.  She finds a spot that is blocked by a two-space-taking junker car.  She gets angry.  She leaves a note on said car.  She Goes Shopping.  She comes back to her car.  Okay, Okay I know what you are thinking.  This sounds like a mundane sequence of events.  Well first off, the tension that exists in these otherwise banal scenes I cannot even begin to describe.  I mean this was truly brilliant filmmaking.  That being said, I will admit, not much happens in the first 15 minutes.  But then...o yes, but then, the chaos ensues.  When Kim's character gets back to her car, the thugs from the aforementioned junker are waiting.

These thugs are creepy.  And they are angry.  And they are racially diverse.  Did I mention they have guns?  As you can imagine, they use guns (they literally blow this dudes head off right in front of Kim B.).  Kim B. freaks the f out and gets in a wild car chase.  She crashes.  She fleas.  They follow.

That is where I will stop the exposition...I will simply leave you with a little taste of things to come:

Kim B. kicks the most a$$ in the most visually entertaining ways (for about 45 minutes) I've seen on the big screen literally since Kill Bill 2.  Tire Irons up noses, screwdrivers through heads, foot in butts.  And she looks as hot as she did in LA Confidential to boot.

 The special effects we have come to love from Guillermo Del Toro movies are on full display.

 The raw, gritty, and at times surrealistic elements of Don Murphy movies can be seen throughout.

And finally, a surprise twist ending that I would have literally never guessed.

Should you see this movie?  Yes!  Provided of course, you don't hate sweet movies that are as fun as they are terrifying.",1237507200,5,4084,4.610570236439499
3766063,1,B001QMCJ14,"*** This review will contain spoilers ***

My, how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is a damn good actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason in particular: leaps over logic. Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid. This is one of the worst thrillers I've ever seen.

The story details Della(Kim Basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall and is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.

If the plot description isn't enough to dissuade you from watching this then you surely are a trooper. The acting is terrible and unconvincing. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love Hollywood?)is laughable to a fault. The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum(played by Lukas Haas) was so out in left field that it makes you shake your head in shame. Like I said earlier if this movie would have came out in the 80s or the 90s it might have gotten a pass and accepted as camp but in 2008 its a joke that nobody finds funny. Now I know some people are going to be like its not supposed to be smart. My reply: Come again? Thrillers have never been known to be stupid. Silence Of The Lambs, Seven and The Sixth Sense are fine examples of that statement. Its these recent crop of thrillers that have given the thriller genre a bad name. And for the record the only genres where people are known to expect a little stupidity are Action, Horror and Comedy. So please come up with a better argument than that. If I Know Who Killed Me, The Bone Collector, Twisted and this clown show are the best the thriller genre has to offer these days shed a tear for a dead genre. Not even good enough to be a guilty pleasure. You were warned.",1235692800,6,2187,4.277777777777778
3766064,1,B001QMCJ14,"It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this ""movie."" No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing. She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.

The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.

**After she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? I don't mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back. But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. No woman would do that unless she 1) had a weapon, 2) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them. None of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream??

**When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes. She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should've ran.

(I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because I loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it).

**Why would she carry a loud, Red Toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? When she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then eventually opens it. And takes out a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. When asked to open the box, she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch/push/open/manipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical/shoot him in the face/render him unconscious, which was the hero's plan all along. It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.

**Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.

**When she was running away, how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.

**Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said, they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't get the license plate. Even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?",1228262400,2,4329,4.505732484076433

3766121,2,B001QMCJ14,"Okay, I wanted to like this formatted-for-TV movie.  I have enjoyed Kim Basinger and Luke Haas in other films and I often like this type of film.  Even in this ""film,"" they both had moments where their acting craft shown through.  And Basinger looks great at 54 (when this was made); compare how she's aging with the 5-year younger Craig Sheffer, who plays her husband.  Unfortunately, the best acting in the world couldn't save this dismal work.

The first 20 minutes could have been cut to 5 with the same effect.  The rest of the movie shows why this couldn't be edited down; the whole thing could have been cut to half the time without losing any of the story.  But then the producers wouldn't have something movie-length to foist on the public.  The dialogue is 1-star.  The lighting is poor, even indoors.  The 4-guy gang is comprised by a white (Haas), a black, a latino, and an Asian, which might seem a point for diversity, rather than the start of a ""There-was-a"" joke.  Differently described, however, it was a minority gang with a white token, which doesn't seem enlightened in the least.  This criminal gang was also hapless and feeble.  The black guy dies after the latino steps on his neck and breaks it.  Basinger beats the latino to death and then jumps from a height to choke and then stab to death the Asian.  I don't think any of those three gang members got a single hit to her.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

As for those 5-star ratings, consider them ironic.  There's nothing great about this film (except for how Basinger looks.)",1382572800,,1561,4.534050179211469

This Lady has 2 Twins, and an abusive Husband, and she goes to the Mall one night, a couple Days, before christmas, and leaves a note on this Crappy looking car,in the parking lot, because they took up 2 Parking spaces. Well, once she gets out of the mall, the 4 Boys, are waiting for her,and start harrasing her, and the parking attendant, comes over to help, and one of the Boys, shoots him in the head, she gets in her car, and leaves, but they follow her, and she gets in a wreck, and she grabs a toolbox from her car, and heads sraight for the woods. Of course, they follow her, because she is a witness to the murder. So the whole movie goes on, and she kills 2 of them in the woods, and finnaly, after a long night of running, hiding, and chasing, it comes down to the final 2. Her, and the last of the Remaining Dilenquants. and it comes down to the stupidest part in the whole movie, Which i tottaly Didn't get,At All. and the reason why i took a star off, She starts making out with him, and practically does the dirty with him, right in the middle of the woods, after they have been trying to kill each other, all night. WTF?!!?! Finnaly, She pulls out a flare gun and burns him a little, when she is on top of him, and then shoots him in the chest. So, she left the woods, and was singing christmas carols, down the street on the way to her house, which again, was a part that i tottaly, Did not get, because Honestly, who would be singing after a mass murder spree happened?? So she gets in her door, and goes up stairs and kisses her kids goodnight, and then shoots her husband in the chest. End of Movie.

3766149,3,B001QMCJ14,"I just couldn't get into this one and it had huge credibility gaps. The premise: A woman is surprised by a bunch of very bad guys after she finishes shopping. She gets in her car and they chase her (upcoming SPOILER alert), after shooting a mall security guard. Eventually, her car gives out and she races for a construction site full of partly built homes, armed primarily with tools from a toolbox she managed to grab from her car.

I think this was when things were supposed to reach peak suspense, challenging the viewer to wonder, ""How does she manage to get out of this situation with only the items in her tool box?"" Unfortunately, there were several parts that just didn't make sense. For instance....why didn't anyone hear or report or see the security guard being shot? How could murder and mayhem occur at a construction site without attracting attention? Also - and this may be only my take as someone related to a builder- most construction sites have their own security guards or at least nightly police patrols. For all this to happen as it did and with lots of noise...it just didn't add up.

Finally, the characters just weren't all that interesting. Basinger held her own but she didn't have much to work with. This could have been a much better movie but for me it was yawn-worthy.",1295913600,2,1300,4.623376623376624

3766151,2,B001QMCJ14,"Wow. Where do I begin? If you wonder why I gave this movie two stars it's only because I am a big Kim Basinger fan and I like Lukas Haas too. Everything else deserves less than one star but I decided to be generous. This was one of the most ridiculous so-called thrillers I've ever seen in my life. It wasn't crafty. It wasn't clever. It wasn't mysterious, and the only thing frightening was that someone actually thought this needed to be a movie. Why inflict such pain on the innocent movie lovers of the world?

We start off with Della (Basinger) who is supposed to be an abused wife. The only evidence of this we see is her husband (Craig Scheffer, why he's still getting parts I have no idea), yelling at Della about cleaning up the house. He jacks her up and this is supposed to convince us that Della is a battered wife. Please. So Della goes out on Christmas Eve to get some wrapping paper and all hell breaks lose. And I mean for the audience as well because the film goes downhill with every turn to the point where you'd wish she'd just go back to the house and call it a night so we can go on with our lives.

During her outing, Della is confronted by four thugs. She's left a note on their car about them taking up two parking spaces. This was the biggest question mark to me in the whole movie. HOW THE HELL DID THEY KNOW DELLA WAS THE ONE WHO LEFT THE NOTE? No one was in the car when she left it! Yet these guys knew it was her? Come on! This group who I nicknamed the Mickey Mouse club because they were about as intimidating as four little girls fighting over a Barbie doll, decides to teach Della a lesson. Lukas Haas (who I can't believe would even think of being in this mess) plays Chuckie the so-called leader of this ""gang"". Please. Chuckie is aided by an Asian gangmember, a black gangmember, and a Hispanic gangmember. Yes it's the Junior United Nations. This was the most unrealistic part of the film. Not only was it laughable to believe all of these guys were supposed to be tough, but you mean you have a black and a Hispanic in the group and the white dude is the leader? On top of that I couldn't figure out why Chuckie who is thirty years old is hanging around these ""kids"" or are we supposed to believe that Haas is a teen? If so I wouldn't be surprised with the BS we were forced to believe in this film.

So after Della witnesses this crew killing a security guard she's thrust into fighting for her life. The movie turns into a bad replica of Judgment Night except this film isn't even in that movie's league. The gang chases Della through the woods. Yeah the woods. She's in the Inner city one minute and five minutes later she is in the woods? Okay.

This movie was horrible! We're supposed to buy Della as being smart but she does the dumbest things. Instead of using every opportunity to get away from the four dummies, she sits around and listens in on their extremely loud conversations. She takes time to reminisce about her kids, even pees, anything instead of getting her butt outta dodge! The smart thing for Della to have done would have been to hide somewhere and wait for daylight. It was the woods! No way they'd find her but no, she runs around in the woods as loud as she can. What was so pitiful was how it did not matter how long Della took off before the dummies found out she was gone, she always ended up in their sights. And it's hard to believe that Della couldn't get away from the idiots seeing how Chuckie can light up the entire woods with his flashlight and he yells her name every two minutes. Obviously Della is dumber than we think because she gets warning after warning that the dummies are close to her, yet never gets away.

The beginning was boring. The middle was horrid and the end makes you wanna contemplate the cast's murder or your own suicide. We have to sit through a very bad monologue by Chuckie (I assume to show us his good side, as if we care). Chuckie decides to use his charms to persuade Della to come out of hiding. Oh yes that's the big thing! Instead of Della getting her butt out of the woods while Chuckie's talking, she's sitting behind a tree trunk, listening! She's listening instead of using this as a time to get away. After Chuckie's hour-long speech, he comes onto Della and by our disgust, Della decides to seduce Chuckie and from that point on I'm convinced this movie was a comedy the entire time. It's so unbelievable with Della and Chuckie that you wonder if the film is actually trying to overlook the fact that Basinger is thirty years older than Haas and old enough to be his mother. Yet while they are kissing and fondling, it's like the filmmakers want us to forget how it's so unbelievable that these two would go down this route. It didn't make any sense. The ending alone delivered more laughs than a Saturday Night Live episode. After that you spend your time pulling out your toenails with pliers, hoping it ends soon and finally it does.

I'd give it five stars if it were a comedy. Unfortunately it wasn't.",1284940800,8,5023,4.3382978723404255

3766153,2,B001QMCJ14,"Kim Basinger is an Academy-Award winning actress! I can't believe she was in this movie. OK, it wasn't as terrible as you may think and her character isn't horrible - but the plot is just dumb. Basically, this abused housewife goes to get wrapping paper at a mall during Christmas time - takes a parking place and is then followed and tortured for an hour by a group of thugs. I don't know if it was a metaphor for how she felt in her life (being abused by her husband and getting to fight back finally...) I couldn't understand why Basinger chose to do this! It didn't even seem like a really good ""acting"" piece. Maybe she just wanted to do a thriller, who knows. I wouldn't recommend it.",1275264000,4,690,4.3565891472868215
3766154,2,B001QMCJ14,"Although ""While She Was Out"" boasts an original twist or two, you've basically seen it many, many times before.  It's the one about the passive woman facing a threat so monstrous that she reaches down into her core and finds a transformative strength and rage she never knew she possessed.  Think Jennifer Lopez in ""Enough"", Olivia de Havilland in ""Lady in a Cage"", Nicole Kidman in ""Dead Calm"", Debbie Reynolds in ""Singin' in the Rain"".  (Just kidding on that last one.)

This time, Kim Basinger is the lady.  An abused wife and mother, she goes to the mall on Christmas Eve, and leaves a note on a car taking up two spaces in a crowded lot.  Predictably, the car belongs to a gang of four psychopathic toughs who kill the mall cop that comes to her rescue.  She manages to escape in her vehicle, but wrecks it in a new property development surrounded by woods, and flees into the forest with her trusty tool box, the murderous gang hot on her heels.

All this might be kind of silly fun, except the screenplay asks the audience to stretch belief beyond the breaking point.  Despite the enormity of the forest at night, the gang tracks her down by (no, I'm not making this up) picking up the lingering scent of her perfume and sweat in the air, by tracking little droplets of her blood, by shining their flashlight in just the right spot while she's standing in the open.  Of course, she helps them out by whimpering and thrashing through the forest with as much noise as possible.  Plus, she stands in the middle of a shallow stream and screams at the top of her lungs, ""God!  Where are you God?!!"" ... hardly a smart thing to do if you're trying to avoid detection.

That the movie is even watchable is attributable to a fairly engaging performance by Kim Basinger as the lady in distress (she also co-produced) and a valiant effort by Lukas Haas as the leader of the gang.  Haas has some of the worst dialogue ever written, and he almost ... almost ... manages to make it sound credible.  There is also a wonderful payoff in the final shot of the film, and so it ends on an intriguing note.  Unfortunately, these credits don't nearly begin to make up for the film's obvious detriments, and so I can't recommend a purchase.

3766170,1,B001QMCJ14,"In ""While She Was Out"" Kim Basinger plays Della, a timid upper-class housewife who is terrorized by four thugs on the Christmas Eve. The film's premise sounds promising, but those who are looking for a solid B-thriller like ""Cellular"" (starring Basinger) will be disappointed because ""While She Was Out"" is about as thrilling as watching paint dry. Frankly I don't know what this film is all about.

As I said, Kim Basinger's character is threatened and chased by a gang of four ethnically diverse thugs. The gang's leader is ""Chuckie"" (Lukas Haas) and Chuckie gets more than he bargained for when he and other gangsters corner her in the house construction site. The ineptness and incompetency of the hunters and the hunted alike are amazing, sometimes (but not often enough) providing some unintentional laughter. All I can say is, a red toolbox comes in handy when you are in trouble.

Craig Sheffer plays Della's bullying husband, a thankless role which exists for one purpose only - to show the psychological ""change"" of the heroine. While watching this film, I actually tried to find a subtext or symbolism behind the script of this terribly banal thriller. Sorry, but I couldn't find one.

To me the most intriguing part of the film is that the number of producers exceeds 10, and that one of them happens to be Guillermo del Toro. How come the director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Hellboy"" got involved in this project may be more interesting than the film itself.",1259971200,3,1470,4.848605577689243

At no point did I find the gang terrorizing her to be at all frightening or intimidating, and the film left me waiting anxiously for Kim to open up that red toolbox and start taking these guys apart. Credits rolled, and nothing. The DVD art is incredible, throwing out a ""Hard Candy"" type of vibe that the film never comes close to delivering.",1259280000,4,781,4.700729927007299
3766172,5,B001QMCJ14,"Whether or not housewife Della (Kim Basinger) knows it, she's got some good, unconscious natural instincts to take out offending attackers. This movie shows how one female victim instinctively takes out 4 punks and her rude husband.

Della goes out of her house at night to get some fresh air from her rude husband during Christmas and decides to go late-night shopping. The parking lot was full and brimming with people. She drives around, spots a sleek car taking up 2 spaces and decides to write a note to the owner saying something to the effect of: ""You're taking up 2 spaces. How selfish of you."" If one were ponder over whether all her troubles could have been prevented, this may have begun from her urge to slip that friendly note on that car. Of course, she couldn't have known what would await her.* Men generally don't like to be told what to do. Worse thing is that the glancing profile of that empty car could signal to any woman that generally aggressive males who like to show off could be the owner. Was Della looking for trouble by voicing off her frustration? Why did she park her car so close to the offending car? Why did leave the shopping mall at a time when everyone has left, there were few other cars left in the parking lot? Why did she get out of her car even when she was blocked from behind by the threatening car with 4 punks in it? She couldn't have known what was coming, could she?

Whatever it was, Della has hard luck that night, but God and Della's own sheer guts saw to it that she made it home in one piece.

How she took out those 4 scumbags wasn't gory enough! They deserve much worse for being such evil bullies!

3766173,1,B001QMCJ14,"The behavior of the people in this movie is just not believable.

I typically love these kind of movies, where the main character is set up to experience a life-or-death situation that causes true growth (like Sara Connor in the first Terminator movie). But it ends up being a lot of aimless running around in the woods made to set up situations where Basinger can kill her pursuers with items found in the toolbox from her car.

There are moments where she does even not try to get away -- instead she continues to hang around near her pursuers and listen to their conversations. There are other places where she's so clumsy and noisy it's ridiculous. And the scene where she actually starts seducing one of the boys is laughable. Basinger has always been one of my least favorites actresses, but even Meryl Streep couldn't have made this work...

Not until the final scene does she show signs of turning into someone different than the lame, superficial, brow-beaten housewife she started out as, and as satisfying as that is, it wasn't worth watching the whole movie to get there.",1256515200,5,1083,4.71957671957672
3766174,2,B001QMCJ14,"WHILE SHE WAS OUT is a horror film with pretensions to serious ""meaning."" It is based on a horror short story of the same name by Edward Bryant, a respected writer of science fiction and mysteries. Here is a short excerpt from his story, taken from an online marketing blurb:

  The lights, bright and blinding, blasted against her mirrors.
  Della stamped the accelerator to the floor.
  This was crazy! This didn't happen to people--not to real people.
  The mall security man's blood in the snow had been real enough.
  In the rearview, there was a sudden flash just above the left-side headlight, then another.
It was a muzzle-blast, Della realized. They were shooting at her.

Let us agree that we're not dealing with fiction that competes with Steinbeck's or Faulkner's or Hemingway's best stuff. This is junk-food fiction, and in some moods this is exactly the sort of thing many of us enjoy relaxing with. But we don't kid ourselves.

In the film, Kim Basinger plays Della, a mother who needs to buy more wrapping paper for her twins' presents on Christmas Eve, Craig Sheffer plays her husband, who suddenly becomes abusive towards her when his business is going bad, and Lukas Haas plays the leader of small gang of punks who decide they will rape and murder her because she dissed their ability to park their car properly at a mall.

The DVD's hardcase gives a semi-accurate summary that might be construed as a spoiler: ""Kim Basinger ... stars as Della, an ordinary suburban housewife who witnesses a cold blooded killing while finishing some last minute shopping. Keeping her wits about her she tries to flee while pursued by a young psychopath ... and his three henchmen. She crashes into an unfinished housing development near the woods. ... Armed only with a toolbox and the will to survive, Della must figure out a way to kill them one by one or she will never see her family again.""

Given this ""plot,"" we expect (and get) another movie about a good looking female overcoming great odds when put danger. In other words, it is of the same general genre as ALIEN and ALIENS and TERMINATOR and even CHARLIE'S ANGELS. And yet it lacks the drive and imagination of any of these. In making the transfer from the page to the screen, Susan Montford, the director/scriptwriter, makes it clear that she has no idea how to build and maintain suspense, how to create characters who either have consistent traits or have inconsistent traits that are plausible, or how to provide us with a diverse array of defensive/offensive techniques which build to a climax. Even the easily foreseen killing of the fourth punk is more of a ""fizzle"" than a ""blast""--and the film keeps going for quite a time after that. Most people, I believe, will find the final scene of this movie is a huge disappointing cop-out.

One of the ""bonus features"" on the DVD is a commentary track where Susan Montford discusses what she was trying to accomplish in her first full-length film. Among other things, it becomes crystal clear that she is totally misinformed about the so-called Stockholm Syndrome (which has to do with hostages becoming emotionally attached to their captors over a prolonged period of time--unlike any situations in this film). And if Montford had meant us to see the ending as a Feminist Statement of any sort, she should have made Della's husband more clearly a villain--and should have made that ending more clearly a decisive act.

If you STILL want to watch it, I would say rent it rather than buy it.",1256169600,,3507,4.760726072607261
3766185,3,B001QMCJ14,"If you think too much about this movie, you'll not enjoy it, but if you take it for what it is, and just watch it for the action, this movie isn't too bad.  It makes no sense how Basinger goes from a shy, timid, abused housewife to a mouthy, tough woman who stands up to a gang of thugs in a matter of an hour.  Is this just because of the xmas traffic at the mall and her credit card getting declined?  This is quite the reach.  And, the scene at the end, where she lures the head thug in, is hard to believe.  Finally, she returns home, desperate to see her children again, and then pulls a gun on her husband, like she's going to kill him with her children in the other room?!?  Anyway, otherwise, it's not a bad movie, and you're totally pulling for her, and watching her take out the thugs chasing her one by one is somewhat entertaining.",1251763200,,843,4.141104294478527
3766186,5,B001QMCJ14,This is a very good movie about someone hitting their breaking point then getting pushed so far beyond it that they can never go back.  It is a strong movie about female empowerment and how some people who you might never think would commit a crime are the ones who can be the most dangerous when put into the correct situation.  It is extremely violent with plenty of bad language and plenty of people who receive a karmmic retribution.  I loved this film because it sends the message that the people who you least suspect can often be the most dangerous and the true nature of someone when after they are pushed into pure survival mode.  Plus I loved the plot.  It is a kiss off to anyone out there who thinks that I can bully someone else and get away with it.,1250812800,11,763,4.3076923076923075
3766187,4,B001QMCJ14,"I just finished watching this film, and must say that Della (Kim Basinger
's character), was very effective and surprisingly strong. The music and dark, shadowy atmosphere worked in this film, very well, and her contradicting ""weakness"" portrayed early on is quickly combated with her surprising answer to these thugs' attempts to subdue her. I was rooting for her from the beginning, and her acting was believable and convincing-great job on her part.

These thugs on the other hand were a bit humorous, and the lead ""Chucky"", played an interesting character, which perhaps deserved a bit more exploration. He was a strange blend of psychologist (tapping into her ""dreams""), seeming perhaps a bit more cognizent and mature than his ""thug"" character would suggest. It was unexpected, but an interesting aspect. Some of the dialogue among the assailants was just humorous.

I know a movie is only a finite length, but Kim Basinger's character deserved a bit more depth, and perhaps more than a glimpse into her life. The film makers, if they intended to, however, did an effective job of taking a ""snapshot"" of her life.

This film was better than expected, and it clearly allowed Kim Basinger to shine, with her realistic, and mature subtelty in her acting ability. Give this woman more high profile parts-she is underrated! Give this film a look!",1245974400,,1347,5.004464285714286
3766188,1,B001QMCJ14,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  It's so bad--and not in a campy, funny ""Xanadu"" way.

Then there's the little boy from ""Witness"", Lukas Haas, who's now all grown up and in the same boat as Basinger.  So what's ""While She Was Out"" all about?  First, I must say it's a really bad title for a film, but I guess they couldn't come up with anything better.  Basinger plays Della, a suburban housewife who is verbally abused by her nasty husband (played by ""One Tree Hill's"" Craig Sheffer in a thankless role).  After we see a cruel scene between the ""happy"" couple, Basinger goes out on Christmas Eve to get some more wrapping paper at a mall, and she meets up with Haas and his three henchmen in the parking lot.  He ends up killing a security guard and then chases Kim into some woods, where she finally stands up for herself and begins to eliminate the bad guys with tools from a toolbox she's carrying around.  The violence is quite bloody and gruesome, and the final scene between Basinger and Haas is bizarre and unbelievable.  I don't recommend this flick to anyone--especially if you're a Basinger fan.  It's a repulsive, unpleasant 86 minutes, and you will regret wasting your time.",1245888000,4,1333,4.531380753138075
3766189,3,B001QMCJ14,"This movie is just OK.  It's made well enough but the story is very slight.  Jerky husband Craig Sheffer comes home and gets jerky with timid housewife Kim Basinger.  Kim goes to the mall.  When she comes out, we're 23 minutes into this 80-minute movie and nothing much has happened.  She then runs into some young hoodlums in the parking lot who proceed to chase her through the woods for an hour or so.  Fortunately for her, she has a toolbox and finds the gumption to use its contents to defend herself.  This movie is based on a 10-page short story and it shows -- there's not really anything more to it.  The trailer pretty much covers the entire film, which never gets very interesting or clever.  Don't expect any ""wow"" moments.

On the plus side, the disc is of very high quality.  Despite this being a relatively low-budget flick that takes place almost entirely outdoors at night, image detail is pretty good and the colors are rich and attractive.  The audio is quite solid as well, with creepy music and subtle effects setting the mood.  Extra features include 25 minutes of decent interviews with the director, producer and cast and an excellent commentary track with the director and producer.

Basinger is Della, who starts the film being berated and borderline physically abused by her yuppie scum of a husband. It's almost Christmas, and Della needs to get away from Yuppie Jerk and into the Christmas Spirit. She hits the mall, buys some wrapping paper, and gets to watch a murder.

Leaping into her car faster than eight tiny reindeer, Della is pursued from the mall by a bunch of Gap Thugs, led by Chucky (Lucas Haas). The gang is PC perfect, with one Asian, one African American and one Hispanic following Boss Chucky into their jalopy and after Della. After a almost painfully tepid start, they all crash in an empty construction development, and the chase is on. Up till now, Della has been in a near stupor, but she manages to grab a toolbox and become one killer cougar.

The problem is, nothing here at all works to logic. The sex scene is howlingly bad, the tire iron kill is laughable, and despite the fact that they are lost in the woods, the gang never seems to lose track of Della, nor does she ever manage to get away, no matter how hard she runs. Once the excruciatingly slow start has moved to the woods and housing development, ""While She Was Out"" turns into a grinding dull cat and mouse game that will soon have you pressing down the fast forward button on your remote in hopes that something new happens.

3766192,2,B001QMCJ14,"When I first heard about this movie I had high hopes. Kim Bassinger has made some genuinely good career choices recently, even turning in a decent performance in a so so movie called CELL. So when I heard she was going to play a beleaguered housewife who finally stood up to a group of attackers I had high hopes. Unfortunately they were dashed to the ground as I watched.

Bassinger stars as Delta, a housewife with two children whose husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer) displays a violent temper and an unwillingness to own up to the fact that he too is responsible for his family. It's Christmas Eve and Delta still has a touch of shopping to do. She leaves home after a verbal assault from Kenneth (that ended in his fist through a kitchen wall) to go shopping.

At the mall Delta is first upset at the number of shoppers who have decided to do last minute shopping just as she has. And having worked in retail I can tell you, I've never seen NEAR this many literally last minute shoppers either. But she parks far from the mall and heads in. When she comes across a car that has taken two spaces close to the mall, she leaves a note on the windshield letting them know what a jerk they are.

A tedious segment of shopping follows and finally Delta heads to her car. She notices the note is now missing but the car is still parked. By the time she gets to her car, the offender has followed her and a group of punk teens led by Chuckie (Lukas Haas) jump out of their car to threaten her. When a security guard attempts to come to her aid, Chuckie shoots and kills him. Delta makes a run for it, speeding off in her car while the teens argue.

Okay, while we've already been witness to some stupid things happening in this film (don't they always?) we are now given the chance to see Delta, equipped with a nice head start, not able to avoid the car following her but also losing control of her car and crashing it. With a still distant car in pursuit, the smart thing would be to get as far away as possible, right? Not in this film. Here, it makes more sense to stay in the car and watch as the other car approaches and THEN get out to make a run for it.

Taking a tool box from her trunk, Delta heads to a nearby construction site where houses are being built. Moving from house to house in search of a place to hide, she ends up in what should be a great location...only to leave that for a lesser one and make enough noise to let her pursuers know where she is.

When one of them falls and breaks his neck as he chases her, the rest decide its payback time and set out to find Delta no matter what. But when push comes to shove, Delta decides she's had enough of people pushing her around, enough of people taking advantage of her and enough of playing the victim.

Armed with her smarts and the tools she has in her box, Delta makes a point of letting these punks know she's not the mom to be messed with. And rather than leave as they go down one by one, they continue to try and make her an example of the opposite.

So why does this movie fail? For one it is far too slow a movie pacing wise. This type of movie should move along so much faster. Check any Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson revenge film to see just how fast.

Secondly, the character of Delta seems far too mentally lost to become this sudden avenging angel. As Bassinger portrays her, she is afraid of her own shadow and backs down from any confrontation. Just a subtle glimpse of a woman inside willing to change would have made this more believable. Instead she does a complete turn around, going from terrified victim to commando mode.

With better pacing, a more believable character and a chance to let that character unfold with glimpses of the real fighter inside prior to that release we could have had a decent revenge film here. As it stands, it moves along far too slow and offers us someone we find difficult to believe, even in the far off land of make believe known as movies. Let's hope Bassinger's next choice gives us something better.",1244332800,2,4027,4.2938076416337285

Della (Kim Basinger) lives in a gated community and is a devoted mom married to an abusive, former jock  (Craig Sheffer).  She has the appearance of a delicate -- even fragile -- creature, incapable of inflicting harm on others.  But that changes after she is accosted by a gang of thugs while doing some last-minute Christmas shopping.  Their leader, Chuckie (Lukas Haas), is clearly a sociopath itching to cause some serious pain.  The lone Della must defend herself for her very survival as she improvises defenses with garage tools and ingenuity.  Basinger is good and elicits a degree of sympathy, but when things start looking awfully familiar, that sympathy dissipates.  The film is rated R.

3766205,5,B001QMCJ14,"""While She Was Out"" is a 2008 ""sleeper"" movie starring Kim Basinger as Della.  Della is a housewife that takes a lot of abuse from her husband (Craig Sheffer) for not ""being her best"".  This movie takes place Christmas Eve and after Della gets a mouthful from her ""old man"", she checks on her children and then goes to the mall for some last minute holiday shopping.

Once Della gets to the mall she cannot find a place to park.  She finds two parking spots that are being taken by one car.  This really annoys Della and once she finds a parking space she leaves a note on this selfish car about her frustration.  While Della is in the mall she is given some reminders why her life is in a bit of a rut.

Once she has completed her shopping she heads back to her car and is approached by four punks, lead by Lukas Haas.  These punks happen to be the owners of the car Della left the note on prior.  Well to make a long story short, the punks accost her and she manages to drive away only to end up crashing into a residential community that is in a pre-construction phase.  The punks follow her and the result is a cat and mouse game that transpires between the residential community and a forest.

One thing I found interesting about this movie is that Della manages to grab a red toolbox out of her car before the chase begins.  I really think this movie should have been called ""Toolbox"", ""Red Box"" or something of that nature.  Once a person views this movie, they might share my opinion.

I felt this movie was really good for what it was.  A lower budget thriller/horror movie, with a different premise, not totally original, but different nonetheless. Kim Basinger was really great in this movie; I don't think I have seen her in anything quite like this before.  As for Lukas Haas, this is also a different role for him; I felt he did a good job.  As for the criticism about the ""multicultural"" gang of punks, this really didn't bother me.  Is it really that dim that there would be a gang of people from different cultures?  The thought of culture demographics wasn't on the brain while I was watching this movie.  To quote Depeche Mode, ""People are people"".

As for realism, there were times this movie was a bit over the top (there was a scene where Della could have been Chuck Norris) and not everything was totally credible.  As a matter of fact, one could say there were even some minor loop holes with regards to plot.  In contrast, this movie was only eighty minutes and for the most part provided non-stop entertainment.  I also felt that ""While She Was Out"" also produced some tense and creepy moments.  This movie might not be for everyone, but if anyone is fond of the classic ""revenge"" movie, then they will love this.

Back to the disrecptected wife thing.  Her husband is a total piece of crap, but I can't help but to side with him on various things.  She's a stay at home mom, and the husband gets really pissed off when he gets home and there is kid crap ALL OVER the house and yard.  I mean their crap is just about literally everywhere.  He goes crazy and starts attacking her (verbally) for it, but I have to say I can't help but to take his side on that, but I digress. I guess we are supposed to feel bad for her, b/c everyone takes advantage of her.  four dumb, predictable teens are trying to kill her for some reason that doesn't matter.  She doesn't have a cell phone for some reason, but who cares anyway.  I really don't know how anyone could get into this movie, it is just so boring.  Too little happens and the stuff that does is just so uneventful.  The violence/action is just silly and simple-minded.  that's all there is to this movie and it is, again, just boring.  Another thing that annoys me is the the fact that she has a retractable tire iron in a tool box.  First things first, i don't even think that there is such a thing (maybe NASA uses it to fix space tires but that's about it), but second why would it even be in a tool box?  The ending was just... I don't even know what it was.  Don't try to make up for an insanely boring movie with a crazy twist like that.  It just doesn't fit.

3766208,1,B001QMCJ14,"I have no other explanation as to why Kim Basinger would have otherwise agreed to participate in this waste of film stock.

The plot is very simple.  Kim plays a mother of twins and is married to a loud-mouthed, abusive stock broker.  On Christmas Eve she must go to the local shopping center to pick up some gift wrapping paper.  Her children are understandably excited about the imminent arrival of Santa.  You might expect that she would want to find her wrapping paper and return home as soon as possible.  You would be wrong.  Apparently her husband's brutish behavior has upset her to the point that she leaves home without telling anyone where she is going and then tries to ask a friend to meet her for a drink.  Although he is unsuccessful in setting up this meeting, she does spend a lot of screen time driving through the parking lot trying to find a parking spot.  Her efforts are complicated by the actions of an unknown driver who has decided to take up two parking spaces with his large car.

After finally locating a parking spot in a nearby garage does she rush into the mall to complete her task and return home to her children?  No, she takes the time to write a note of complaint to the driver of the car taking up two spaces first.  Then she enters the mall, browses for nightwear, has some tea, spends time chatting with an old high school acquaintance, and finally buys her wrapping paper.  When she returns to her car she is confronted by the driver of the vehicle for whom she had left the note.  Apparently the screenwriter and/or casting director felt it would interesting for these punks to be representative of several ethnic groups, White Trash, Black, Hispanic, and Asian.  A security guard approaches and tries to provide her with some assistance.  Unfortunately for him, the ringleader of this band of losers shoots him.  Even though the parking lot and the mall had been jammed with shoppers before, for some reason, there were no other witnesses to this shooting other than our poor heroine.

The remainder of the film is basically one long extended chase scene in which Kim flees from her vehicle which she has wrecked in a construction site, all the while being chased by the band of hoodlums.  Fortunately she had the foresight before leaving her vehicle to retrieve a red metal toolbox containing various tools to use as potential weapons that she carries with her while being chased through the woods.  Even though we can hear virtually every footstep that she takes through the brush, none of the tools inside of this metal toolbox make a sound while she swings it at her side as she runs for her life.

As in most films of this ilk there are the usual occasions where you'll scratch your head over the actions of the person being chased.  For example, if the pursuers decide to take a break to dance around nonsensically in a tribute to one of their fallen comrades, wouldn't that be a good time for the person being pursued to try to get farther away from them?  When you have several persons chasing you who have an uncanny ability to track your movements through the woods on a dark night its probably not the best time to take a time out from your running to gaze at a picture drawn by one of your children.

I remember when Kim Basinger made interesting movies such as L.A. Confidential, Final Analysis, The Getaway, and even 9 1/2 Weeks.  This isn't one of them.  Just because I sat through it is no reason that you should.",1241568000,4,3471,4.558064516129032

He (husband of a former co-worker) always raves about how some slasher/thriller film is the most excellent thing he's ever seen, and I just sort of turn a deaf ear to such talk.  I'd much prefer a good solid drama or laugh my rear-end off comedy instead.  Even a bad comedy is normally much better than this sort of film.

She is harrassed by 4 moronic thugs who then murder a security guard who comes to her rescue. From there, the second half of the movie takes to the woods where the thugs chase her and shoot at her and utter some really stupid dialogue and curse a lot.
Basinger's performance is fine and there is a little bit of suspense in the woods but there's not much else going for it. The other characters are silly and asinine.

Della's problems have just begun though, mostly due to her bad habit of leaving critical notes on the windshields of improperly parked cars.

While She Was Out is not a film for those with weak stomachs, but I thought it was a pretty entertaining thriller.  The way the story plays out is fairly predictable, though, and some of the scenes are so dark that you can't see what's going on.  The DVD has a nice selection of extras, including a commentary track.  I would recommend this as a rental if you're into slasher movies.  I wouldn't suggest purchasing it because it's not the kind of thing you're likely to watch more than once.

You will definitely pick up a few valuable tips from watching While She Was Out.  These are as follows:

Always keep a good supply of holiday gift wrap on hand.

If you want to avoid damage to your interior walls, try to tidy up the house a bit before your violent husband gets home from work.

Make sure your cell phone battery is fully charged before you leave the house.

Always pay your credit card bills on time.

If you see a car that's taking up two parking spaces, just walk away from it...no, just RUN away from it!

Just in case you forget any of these tips, take classes in Pilates and mechanics, and keep a well-stocked tool box in your trunk.",1241222400,,1835,4.480362537764351
3766213,2,B001QMCJ14,"Suburban housewife Kim Basinger is forced to fend for herself when she becomes stranded in a desolate forest with four murderous thugs led by a horrifically miscast Lukas Haas! What starts off as a quick trip to the mall ends in the woods with a fight for her life. All she has is a toolbox and her will to survive.

""...truly exceptional..."" says Ain't It Cool News

""...a first rate performance by Kim Basinger"" exclaims LA Weekly

""Amazing and Truly Creepy"" raves Film [...]

""Ordinary and Truly Tepid"" say we.

Apart from the occasional gratuitous graphic violence, WHILE SHE WAS OUT never rises above what it truly is; a woman-in-peril TV movie of the week (circa 1974) that probably would have starred Elizabeth Montgomery. (Although Liz would have given a more compelling portrayal and probably would have nixed squeaky voiced Lukas Haas as the chief baddie. Haas is not so much threatening as he is irritating.) The film is not even unintentionally funny. But there are plenty of eye-rolling moments. . .

On Christmas Eve, Basinger leaves her two darling twinsies at home with her abusive husband while she goes out to get wrapping paper at the mall. On the way, she realizes that her cell phone is dying and she's neglected to bring the charger with her. Naturally, once at the over-crowded mall parking lot, she leaves an insulting note on the windshield of a car that is taking up two spaces. This turns out to be one really stupid move - in a film dedicated to stupid moves - because the car belongs to a melting pot of amatuer thugs who are out for trouble. Things go from bad to worse for our poor stupid (albeit plucky) heroine, and she finds that she is forced to defend herself (rather nastily) with nothing but her trusty red toolbox.

While the toolbox element sounds fairly compelling, amazingly, nothing that follows elicits any true scares (or even any unintended chuckles) - just groans. At one point, Basinger is seen standing in a brook in the middle of the woods repeating ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" and you get the distinct feeling the apology is to the viewer and not to the last two bad guys that she dispatched. And the baddies really are horribly bad at being bad. They probably would have a difficult time against a blind nun.

The film is not just inept, it's terrible. The 86 minute running time seems interminable. (Most of it seems like filler.) Perhaps this should have been a 22 minute segment in some horror anthology. (One of the lesser segments to be sure, but at least short enough to forget after you've hopefully gone on to a better one.)

The cast is good and there is some nice gore and tension to keep thriller fans involved.

It's certainly worth a look and it may grow on me after a few viewings. I remained interested as I watched this film, but I did snicker in parts and I could guess what was going to happen next many times.

While she gives her usual solid performance, this isn't the best movie she's ever done.  The ""gang"" she comes up against is really more of a group of young punks than a real gang, which explains their ineptitude when they to try to kill her for witnessing an accidental shooting they were involved in.

Basinger does such a good job of selling her side that it renders the other performances including a usually reliable Craig Sheffer a little forced and lifeless.

3766239,3,B001QMCJ14,"The underwhelmingly-titled ""While She Was Out"" (that's the best title they could come up with?) involves an abused housewife but loving mom who finds herself, after some really bad luck, in a horrific situation with four murderous thugs chasing her through the woods.  Much mayhem, soul-searching, and freeing of repressed aggression ensues.

This is one of those movies where you can nod in agreement at the reasoning behind certain aspects of the movie, even though that reasoning brings about less than stellar results.  For example, director Susan Montford didn't want typical, one-dimensional thugs chasing Kim Basinger's housewife character, Della.  Rather, she wanted basically regular guys who only became thugs by default, when they crossed the line into horrific violence after a sudden confrontation with a mall cop (the movie industry's newest favored profession).  Okay, interesting idea.  The problem is, once the amateur ruffians were called upon to be the film's villainous, scary thugs, they just just weren't very villainous or scary.  Which admittedly made it believeable that a thin, middle-aged housewife could pick them off one by one, but believable isn't all that tense or thrilling.

There are many examples of this sort of thing throughout the film: good intentions, less than great, and sometimes outright silly, results.  Here's one more example: it was entertaining and refreshing that Della never cowers in fear, even at the outset when she is suddenly confronted by the four rough looking young men in a deserted mall parking lot (prior to the mall cop's arrival).  And that's how she remains throughout the movie: fearless, confident, always thinking her way out of situations.  Okay, I can see what they were going for... abused housewife finally has an outlet to find her inner strength.  But really, would anyone- man or woman- immediately have the nonstop bravery and resourcefulness of Rambo in that situation?  It became silly after a while, especially after Della figures out the most interesting ways to kill her assailants using the items in her car trunk's tool kit.

It was also a hoot that the four thugs in the film are equally represented by four minorities and/or stereotypes who always show up as lowlifes in thrillers like this one: there a black, an Asian, an Hispanic, and a trailer-trash white guy.  I couldn't decide if that made the movie more racist and cliched or less.

Interestingly, sequences that I liked- poor Della having to listen to her abusive husband about their dirty house (though I laughed when a female reviewer here on Amazon pointed out, ""though that house really WAS dirty), Della shopping in the mall, trying to put a brave face on things, and one or two other pre-action moments- other reviewers found a little dull.  Go figure.  To me, those sequences had a little complexity to them, and weren't just cartoony Tom-and-Jerry style chasing and violence.

There's a good little special features section on the DVD, including a 20-some minute behind-the-scenes piece.  After seeing all the commitment and enthusiasm among the cast and film makers in that piece, I felt a little bad that I didn't like the movie more.  Oh, well.  I will say that it was kind of disturbing to hear Kim Basinger go on and on about how she was able to ""...draw from her rich life experience to play this character.""  She did everything but thank outright ex-husband Alec Baldwin for giving her the ability to credibly play an abused, tortured spouse.

Hey, in the end, I always say that boredom is the worst crime that a movie, especially a thriller, can commit.  So, even though ""While She Was Out"" has some definite shortcomings in my eyes, it's never a snoozer, so I'll toss it three stars.  I'll even say it's a perfectly good rental title or one to buy if you can get discount-bin pricing.

I suppose the story, about a suburban housewife getting some cojones when she turns on a quartet of bad guys and kills them one by one, has some aims to be about female empowerment, but this is just muddled and lame. WHILE SHE WAS OUT could refer to the brain of the director for bringing to the screen this morally dubious, fun-free exercise that panders shamelessly to the lowest common denominator.

The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because of one scene near the end, when a bloody and battered Basinger walks to her suburban McMansion, after having killed four very bad men, in the rain, with Christmas lights glowing all around her, singing ""I'll Be Home for Christmas.""

I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical.

The answer is simple.

You pit her against the most vile youngsters that kill security guards, threaten rape, and take up more than one parking spot, then you place her in a remote area where no one will help her but concurrently will allow her to systematically kill every badguy without any chance of being caught.  Oh, and give her a handy toolbox so she has easy-access to a diverse array of improvised killing tools including a tire-iron, a screwdriver and a road flare.

This is While She Was Out (WSWO) in a nutshell.

I'll be honest, I love women power movies where female protagonists break the traditional, and often mysoginistic, trend of being nothing more than a sexual object and/or a clumsy sidekick in film (Constantine anyone?).  It's not because it's really, really sexy, but it shows that women can get just as nasty, if not sneakier, than us males.  WYWO tries to emulate a kind of Thelma and Louise element of women power, but ends up becoming just another violent film albeit with a former Bond girl.

I pretty much outlined the story above so recounting the details would seem a bit repetitive, however, there is something I wish to address.

At the very beginning we are introduced to Della, a.k.a. Desperate Housewife #5, that lives as a reluctant trophy to a seemingly abusive husband.  Abusive husband comes home and goes ballistic when he sees the house is a wreck.  Now, granted the husband was a jerk and deserves a swift kick somewhere personal, but he did have a point when he asked why the house was seemingly destroyed by Toyfest USA.  I mean, the place was worse than my first apartment after thesis research.  You mean to tell me the two kids, ages somewhere between 8-10 could not clean up?  Guess their report on Barney the Dinosaur and Spongebob took up too much time.  Darn midterms!!

Going back to turning the protagonist into a Wonder Woman (albeit without the lasso and sadomasichism), the problem you now run into as a writer is how does a scared and untrained woman fend off four very violent and very ticked off male assailants?  Their solution was dumb down the antagonist to an intelligence level that would make the guests on Are you Smarter Than a Fifth Grader feel smart.  The villains are anything but believable as they're nothing more than drunk hooligans wanting to ""see the ocean.""  Boo hoo, get a picture book.

Also pertaining to the villains, I do not know if this was intentional but all four of the hooligans were portrayed as each major racial and cultural stereotype.  They had the rapping African American (who had his race literally spelled out on his shirt incase you couldn't figure out what race he was), the Catholic-sporting-Spanish-speaking Hispanic, and the overly-compensating-get-drunk-off-one-Corona-beer Asian.  I am NOT making this up.  And, in traditional white egalitarianism, the white trailer trash character leads the way.  I do not know if this was intentional but even my racist little brother watching with me had to point out the absurdity.

The story and lame participants just ruin the movie's potential to be anything more than a B movie.  You can have the best acting in the world (Sorry Kim Basinger, no Oscar for you) and it still wouldn't have redeemed WSWO.  For an 80-minute movie, the actions were repetitive, predictable, and cheesy.  The only real inconsistency was the 20-minute setup for the actual movie.  Return of the King dragged out less.

However, this is not to say the film does not have some redeeming qualities.  It was fun to see a former Bond girl beat some thugs into submission with improvised tools.  The producers spared no level of graphic violence as one guy gets smashed with a tire-iron (repeatedly) and another gets virtually depatitated with a screwdriver.  These were the high-notes as it generated numerous moments of ow-we-feel-your-pain screams from us in the audience.  Unfortunately, this only happens twice as the other two are rather anti-climatic.

All in all, a solid D-.  A rental at best.",1240704000,,4265,4.858725761772853
3766256,4,B001QMCJ14,"Just to briefly explain the movie without giving too much away...  A woman has a run in with some troublemakers at the mall which then becomes a long drawn out cat and mouse situation.  The story centers around Basinger's character as she eludes the attackers and ultimately confronts them.  The story itself may seem a little genre-redundant in parts, but this story did keep me guessing with several atypical plot shifts.

I must note here that I had never heard of this movie before receiving it.  And for a movie promoting a star like Kim Basinger to be unknown, that usually means it was direct to video - intentionally or unintentionally... when test screenings go badly.  I'm not for sure on this particular movie, but the copyright is 2007 - but officially stated as a 2008 release.  That leads me to believe that for whatever reason, this film had legal issues / distribution problems which might have caused the film to have such a limited release in the US.

I usually try to notice how much a DVD will brag about itself on the case.  If the biggest quote you can get is from a small paper or website no one has ever heard of, then you probably shouldn't even mention it.  And, if you can't get at least one positive quote, even when taking the critic out of context, then you have a real piece of junk.  So when I noticed that this DVD case had several respectable quotes bragging about it, I was very excited.  Some of the critical praise on the packaging gave lots of weight to Basinger acting... which almost came across as insulting since the wording made it seem as if her career was already over - it was as if they were surprised by her abilities?  I disagree - it was surprising to see her in this particular movie, but it I knew she would have a great performance.  I think this could be one of her defining roles and definitely made me take a second look at what I thought was her career.  I wish she had been given more diversity in her previous roles, like this film.

Early on in the movie, it has the feel of an 90's era suspense thriller.  In fact, except for a few modern references, this movie could be set in the 90's or even earlier.  It has a timeless feel to it, even as the movie shifts away from suspense thriller to a psychological vengeance film.  I kept forgetting this movie was pretty new.  I think most people will feel surprised by not only the acting, but also some of the plot twists.  Some points in the movie are cliche, but others are overtly anti-cliche, which left me wondering back and forth what was going to happen next.  Most will agree that this movie is as good as most films in this genre that are given wide theatrically releases.

I also think having Anchor Bay distribute this movie is a little misleading.  Most people associate their films with low budget / independent or formerly out of print re-released horror films.  Even the DVD cover has been given the typical indie horror look - metalic black, silver and blood red.  The only thing I noticed that might make this fit into Anchor Bay's normal horror release catalog would be some of the gore.  This film does have a few violent moments that are beyond typical thrillers, but by no means do these scenes rival those of current horror films.  So, if gore isn't your thing then these cringe-worthy moments pass quickly and without overly vivid intentions.

All and all Kim Basinger has been off my movie radar since LA Confidential.  I think this movie, in its own way, allows more depth in Basinger's abilities than movie-goers have scene in at least 10 years.  She should be doing more roles, even if they are small hidden gems like this.  Same goes for Craig Sheffer which I mostly remember from roles such as Nightbreed.  He gives a very believable and important performance, even if he has very little screen time.  Luke Haas continues a brilliant career which caught me off guard in Brick.  Mostly known for his roles as a child actor, he gives an interesting role as the villain.  P.S. - Guillermo del Toro is one of the producers of this film and so far his name has only been associated with movies that I like.

This movie may not be for everyone, but for fans of the genre - it is definitely worth watching at least once.  Most will be pleasantly surprised.",1240617600,,4284,4.48
3766257,2,B001QMCJ14,"Kim Basinger was a great Hollywood beauty and talented actress.  In this film she plays an abused wife who becomes a victim of young thugs--inciting them by leaving a nasty note beneath their car's window wipers. They intend to gang rape her and then kill her and the movie is about how she handles this situation.

As others have noted, the plot was predictable and it is indeed sad to watch such a talented actress (and still attractive woman) reduced to such roles. One can only wonder if the personal abuse she suffered in her well-publicized bitter marriage motivated her to accept this role and act out abused victim-turned-revenged.",1240617600,,639,4.853211009174312
3766258,2,B001QMCJ14,"To put it all in context, Kim Basinger was a Bond girl - next to Sean Connery no less - so to nearly pull off a role as a thirty something upper middleclass housewife at her present age is in itself somewhat impressive...but I did say somewhat. No matter the analytical approach chosen, this movie is a mess, from the set-up of her interpersonal interactions to the attempts at an ironical conclusion.  There are clear instances of domestic abuse and issues with self-awareness and self-actualization. There's obvious depression and a bit later catharsis. There's excessive consumerism and self-absorption, not to mention a trip down the road to post-racial convergences for  single-minded purposes of mayhem. There's slash and bash but not nearly enough to satiate viewers who really appreciate cheesy B flicks of that genre. Yet, what ultimately overshadows is abject inanity.

Maybe I've been off on a misdirected tangent myself recently because what I found most interesting were the infusions of unintentional humor and I'm not talking about the absolutely banal dialogue when the actors were given anything to say but rather how four twenty something non-refundable disposable entities could be alternately obtuse, oblivious or oafish, with incompetency serving as the one unifying trait amongst them. That and the religious symbolism and there is a lot of it - ritual cleansing, mysticism, barbed wire (it's hard to find a crown of thorns in the middle of a partially constructed housing sub-division), impaling with a tire iron cross. Basinger even wades into a babbling brook as she cries out in desperation to the higher powers she thinks have forsaken her.

Not confidentially since I am writing a review, one should never say never but my cool world obsession with managing to get a blind date with Vicky Vale has lasted far longer than 9  weeks but it is time to getaway even if I have to walk 8 miles to do it. Naturally, in the final analysis, IMO watching this movie on your cellular or any other media device would a tremendous waste of time  but fortunately mercifully brief.",1240531200,,2093,5.0
3766259,5,B001QMCJ14,"I was one of the few whom were lucky enough to catch this film when it was in theatres and to the credit of the filmmakers and writer (Susan Montford of SHOOT'EM UP) WHILE SHE WAS OUT was about as an intense of a film I could possibly even imagine...  my hands still hurt from gripping the chair I was in.  Add to that the acting chops of Kim Basinger and Luke Haas and you have a movie I am HIGHLY anticipating on DVD!

From my mouth (keyboard) to your ears (monitors) give this little thriller film a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised!",1240531200,,547,4.190476190476191
3766260,5,B001QMCJ14,"Reading some of the other reviews for this film, I can hardly believe I was watching the same movie. ""While She Was Out"" is, to put it simply, a minimalist noir masterpiece, done with a personal style that is rarely seen in american cinema. Think Mario Bava's ""Rabid Dogs,"" which like this is a film of unflinching realism, and dark pessimism. ""While She Was Out"" is a slow burning fuse, and it begins to explode at about the halfway mark, quickly devolving into an elegant fantasy of sex and violence (is there any difference between the two?). If you are going to die a bloody violent death, Kim Basinger is the woman you want to bring it, and she does it in spades, again and again.  ""While She Was Out"" is a revenge fantasy of epic proportions, with a skewed psychology (reversed phallic symbolism of female penetration) that lesser thrillers can only hope to achieve. This is the one you want to see, and I guarantee you'll recommend to your friends. Oh, and Montford, del Toro, and Murphy are icing on the cake - top notch stuff all the way around!",1240444800,,1054,4.518324607329843
3766261,5,B001QMCJ14,"I had a chance to check out this film in its release in theaters in LA and I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very pleasantly surprised by it.  Kim Basinger plays Della, a battered housewife who has had enough and can't take it anymore.  When she is at her breaking point, she runs into Chuckie (Lukas Haas) and his band of merry thugs, who intend to rough Della up and maybe worse.  They pick the wrong day to mess with her and she is ready to fight back equipped with her trusty toolbox, which makes for some truly memorable and shock-inducing moments later in the film that I won't spoil for you.

Kim Basinger shows the kind of passion in this role that we haven't seen from her since her Academy Award winning performance in LA Confidential and former child star Lukas Haas (Witness, Brick, Mars Attacks, etc.) reminds us that he is still one of today's best young actors.  He turns in a genuinely creepy portrayal as the sleazy, yet charismatic leader of a group of boys tossed aside by society, who only have each other for family.

The film is produced by Hollywood mega-producers Guillermo Del Toro and Don Murphy and is written and directed by Susan Montford, who does a fine job of letting suspense build naturally in the first half of the film and then having it pay off in a big, big way in the second half of the film.  The film is very reminiscent to me of the revenge/vigilante films of the 70s such as Death Wish, Day of the Woman and other such cool, atmospheric grindhouse fare.  If you're into suspense, some really cool ultra-violence and having a lot of fun with a movie, then I'd definitely recommend checking this one out.",1239926400,,1651,4.443708609271523
3766262,5,B001QMCJ14,I thought this was a great little film. There are moments of shear terror mixed in with some purely funny moments that truly took me by surprise. It was a pleasure to watch and I thought Kim Basinger and Lukas Haas did amazing jobs,1239926400,2,231,4.2727272727272725
3766263,5,B001QMCJ14,"I did not know what to expect from this film when I saw it but WOW did Kim Basinger show a different side of her. She is always great in the films I have seen but when she starts taking her revenge out on the boys who are chasing her in the woods she shows us a feral side that I have not seen of her ever. I won't give any of the beat downs away but let me say that are truly brutal and the ending was another thing I did not see coming

Kudos to director Susan Montford for bringing out a side of an already talented actress that has not been seen before, I look forward to seeing more of her films.",1239667200,2,601,3.808
3766264,5,B001QMCJ14,"I saw this film in a packed theatre in Los Angeles.  There were THREE times the audience shouted at the screen- that's a damn good sign for me that people are intent and focused and scared.  The reason the movie works is three fold- first it is simple and we have all been there.  THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.  Second, the director is brilliant in the way she brings you into the story.  REALLY subtle and strong at the same time.  Finally, Basinger goes for it- she is ""just"" a housewife here but she gives a breathtaking performance.  Really impressive feature that is the cornerstone of my library.  You'll enjoy it.",1239667200,,616,4.486486486486487

I'm pretty sure there was a deeper, sort of feminist thing going on in this film, (how women can go insane when they have to keep a house clean) but the whole film would have been better if she had been a more sympathetic, normal woman, perhaps either a single mom or with a decent husband. And you have to believe that a middle aged woman can out-fox and out-run 4 young healthy thugs. All just too far-fetched.",1510099200,,538,4.233009708737864
