8325529,5,B000OH7M78,"This was originally a production on a LP Laser disc.  The visual kaleidoscope is one of a kind with appropriate music to match.  On the much later DVD version only one song of Constance Demby is presented where on the laser disc version, there were two, the missing song called Rapture was never released as a single or included on any on Demby's albums to date.  The same videos are all presented but the music to one was changed.  For me the Rapture song made the whole album but then it synchronized to me personally.  I was able to get a personal single copy if ut from the composer herself.

This is an excellent timeless video display I consider a masterpiece of this kind of abstract dynamic video art.  At the time of it's creation, it was more of a higher level creative skill.  Mr. Jenkins certainly did a unique job at creating it.  The music for the most part is very well matched to the video selections.  It is one to listen to over the ages of any visual moving similar art form.",1391299200,2,994,4.353260869565218
