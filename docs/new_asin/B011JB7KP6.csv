8724401,3,B011JB7KP6,"This 2015 release of the rare Ed Wood-written hillbilly farce has some visual problems, but is still quite a bit better than existing bootlegs.  Films Around The World legally acquired this film back in the 1990's, and this transfer of the film may have been engineered that long ago.  It is full-frame, and the opening credits are poorly framed, with names often cut off at the sides of the image (I checked my copy on two different DVD players).  The color, however, is quite a bit better than the existing bootlegs.  The one or two bootlegs I saw over the years were taken from a print that had faded to reddish-brown.  The color spectrum is superior here, although the image quality is soft.

There are also occasional focusing problems, suggesting that the print was struck from foreign PAL film elements.  Sound quality is pretty good, however.

The film would have been mildly risqu in 1963 when it was new, but would barely rate a PG by today's standards.  The story concerns some lusty hillbillies and a phony preacher/con man.  Ed Wood (under a pseudonym) probably dashed out the screenplay in a day or two.  Jenny Maxwell, remembered for playing a tarty blonde in Elvis' BLUE HAWAII, appears here as a hot-to-trot downhome gal who's not too particular about her beaus.

The disc is a MOD (burned-on-demand DVD-R), and boasts the film's come-hither poster art.",1453248000,5,1370,4.8076923076923075
