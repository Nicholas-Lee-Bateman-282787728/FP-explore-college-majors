I watched more than half of this movie before I had to finally accept that it wasn't very good. I've watched many Bollywood movies and they all typically have a modicum of silliness and unbelievable situations, but this film takes the cake.

The plot in a nutshell is about Karen and his girlfriend Pooja who unfortunately is on a plane at the time its hijacked.  Thankfully Karen is around to save the day, but because of his good deed he is now a wanted man by terrorists.

I had a bit of a problem with the action scenes; they define the idea of unbelievability. I guess the goal was to shoot Karen, but it was his lucky day because he was being chased by the worst shooting terrorists in the world. How anyone could be chased by a helicopter, shot at in open view multiple times, enter a plane of heavily armed terrorists, and be frequently exposed to gun-happy wielding fanatics and still come out of it barely unscathed is ludicrous.  There are fighting scenes with people just standing around and WATCHING holding GUNS. One quick shot and it would all be over, but no, they're just standing around looking bored. I guess we're supposed to ignore them and pretend they're not even there. It was so bad I could only laugh.

Aside from all that though I could probably overlook it.  However this movie has the worst translation done of any foreign movie I've seen.  My favorite caption was instead of terrorists it was written as tourists.  Whole lines of conversation weren't captioned and the majority that were were written in a very jumbled form of English that at times wasn't understandable at all. How very disappointing because I enjoyed the actors and the plot.  Its a shame the pathetic action parts and subtitles were so lousy.",1232064000,,1764,4.664516129032258
