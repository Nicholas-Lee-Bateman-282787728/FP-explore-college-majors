Both are in dual-format BD/DVD. Note that Arrow Films Edition is region B, limited edition (with 3000 copies). Both will be available in late November, 2015. (I placed my order of Arrow Films edition at Arrow Films' own website.)
-------------------

The previous reviewer seems to be reviewing the ""short"" version of Out 1 only, and says nothing about the original version and contents of this DVD set. The fact is that this set contains both the original and the ""short"" versions of Out 1, named ""Out 1, noli me tangere"" (Out 1, don't touch me) and ""Out 1: Spectre"" respectively. The original version is a serial of 8 episodes, with run time ranging from 70 to 105 minutes each (after 4% PAL speedup), and the total run time 12 hours and 23 minutes (with PAL speedup, that makes it 7 minutes shy of 13 hours when played in the theater). Spectre lasts about 4 hours.

This set consists of 5 DVDs. Each of the first 4 discs contains 2 episodes from ""noli me tangere"" and some segments of interviews with the director Jacques Rivette; the last disc houses the Spectre in its entirety. The good news is that there ARE English (and German) subtitles for the original 13 hour version; the bad news: Spectre and interviews are NOT English subtitled, although anyone speaking French or reading German can easily enjoy them. These DVDs are PAL encoded, but are region-free. A good BD/DVD player (e.g., anything by Oppo) will play these discs. There are some minor errors in the transfer (minor cropping of sides and stretching in the first episode) and there is minimal, if any, remastering.(*1) However, the film itself is a masterpiece, and an incredibly pleasurable one! If you have seen ""Celine and Julie Go Boating"" and ""La Belle Noiseuse"" and think you know Rivette's films, wait until you see this!

Strongly recommended for anyone who is interested in art films.(*2)

-------------------
(*1) Personally, I am grateful to this German company Absolut Medien for making the original 13-hour version available on DVD, and am willing to overlook the minor errors. By the way, there are apparently(?) intended black frames in Episode 8 throughout, but this is not mentioned in any review I read. Wonder why....

(*2) You can get it for just over $50 from Amazon's Deutschland site, and that's how I got mine.",1412899200,9,2728,5.315545243619489
