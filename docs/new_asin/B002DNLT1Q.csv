3911930,5,B002DNLT1Q,"Wonderful movie, a must see for any WWII fan, a slight tour on the history of naval aviation and the history behind the aircraft carrier in the USN.",1313884800,,148,4.321428571428571
3911931,5,B002DNLT1Q,"At long last, this great film about the history of aviation and specifically its use with aircraft carriers was released on DVD.  It is clearly one of the more enjoyable and more accurate films about the war in the air during World War II.  The ficitional characters, played by Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, etc., are a real delight as they show the fight for a greater role for aviation in war, at a time when Congress little need to build up the nation's defenses.  General Billy Mitchell had demonstrated that battleships could be sunk by weapons dropped from airplanes, as another fine film with Gary Cooper demonstrates.

One of the remarkable things about this film is its use of vintage Technicolor footage shot by the U.S. Navy during World War II.  About the last half of the film is in color because of the availability of that color footage.  It even includes color footage of some of the first jets, which really revolutionized military aviation.

It is wonderful that this highly entertaining Warner Brothers film was finally released on DVD, after years of only being available on VHS or occasional telecasts on cable channels such as American Movie Classics.",1295308800,,1172,4.85929648241206

3911934,5,B002DNLT1Q,"This film is one of the best films made about Naval Aviation and the Carrier War in the Pacific.  The film uses a lot of archival US Navy film footage of the early days of carrier aviation through WW-II and up to the beginning of the Korean War.
If I am not mistaken the footage near the end of the film of the war ravaged carrier returning to Brooklyn Navy Yard was the USS Franklin severely damaged during the battle of Okinawa in 1945.  The acting in this film featuring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan was also superb.  Any WW-II movie buff or Naval Aviation Buff should acquire this DVD for their collection.",1266710400,,612,4.398230088495575
3911935,5,B002DNLT1Q,Am so glad this movie finally came out on DVD. It's been one of my families favorites since we first saw it on VHS. I especially like the biplane flying scenes and carrier take off and landings footage. Solid performance by Gary cooper and Walter Brennan.,1264291200,,255,4.565217391304348
3911936,5,B002DNLT1Q,"This movie is a great history lesson in picture form.  It has actual film footage of several of the original aircraft carriers of the US Navy, such as Saratoga CV3  and Langley CV1.  The movie starts out in Black and White and then as it progresses, switches to color.  This is because of the actual battle footage used.  You really do not notice the switch.  This movie is a must for anyone interested in how the Navy developed aircraft carriers as an offensive weapon.",1264032000,,470,4.535714285714286

3911942,5,B002DNLT1Q,"This is a very interesting movie, covering US Naval aviation, from the mid-1920s, through the early 1950s. It includes some original, underpowered, biplane  take-off, landing and crash footage, from the USS Langley (CV-1), Americas first aircraft carrier (converted, from a collier, originally the USS Jupiter [AV-3]), as well as original, better-powered, biplane footage, from the original USS Saratoga (CV-3, one of the two Lexington-class carriers, originally built as battle cruisers, in the 1920s, then converted, to carriers), plus film footage from the first, purpose-built, Yorktown-class carrier, named USS Enterprise (CV-6), launched in 1936.
 The movie starts in low-grade, black and white, typical of 1930s quality; then remains so, for the first 70 minutes or so, after which it converts to quality color film. Why they did that I have no idea.
 Historically, its mostly correct and belongs in the collection of anyone interested, in the era or the subject. This is a definite keeper.",1455494400,2,997,5.461038961038961

3911945,5,B002DNLT1Q,"It is a recruiting film for Naval Aviation and wonderful entertainment. The cast, led by Cooper, Wyatt, and Brennan, is great. The time period covered is from the first carrier, the Langley, through WW II. The frustrations of a career officer in peacetime, the danger of early aircraft, and the politics, are covered in drama and humor. Cooper is at his best in this, if it is your genre of interest you will not be disappointed.",1441584000,,429,4.657894736842105

3911961,4,B002DNLT1Q,"This post-WW II movie is well worth a viewing.  The talents of Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan and Jane Wyatt make it a compelling drama, but the real story is the teething problems experienced by naval aviation in its infancy.  The opposition to naval aviation by ""battleship admirals"" and pacifist politicians in the 1920's is nicely portrayed along with the everyday hazards of flying from undersized carriers like the Langley.  The film does a good job of portraying the Battle of Midway and the serious fight the Navy faced from the Japanese Kamikazes during the invasion of Okinawa.  The movie is unusual in the fact that it is in black and white up to Midway, but it is in color from Okinawa to the end of film, probably due to the availability of color footage from the actual battles late in the war.  Most people who grew up from the 1970's on probably don't even knew who Gary Cooper was.  This move is a great opportunity to see this A-list actor at his prime!",1421020800,2,968,4.566473988439307

3911974,4,B002DNLT1Q,"This is a dated but faithful and engaging portrait of naval aviation in the years before and during World War II, with both Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan casting off their usual ""aw shucks"" mannerisms for more sophisticated roles. In the last of their onscreen collaborations, Cooper plays an aviator who helps to pioneer the dangerous maneuvers of taking off from and landing on an aircraft carrier while at the same time helping to promote naval aviation. Eventually he becomes captain of his own carrier, which is beset by attacks from Japanese kamikaze fighters. Brennan likewise plays an aviator who becomes a fleet admiral. A lot of standard melodrama, including a romance between Cooper and Jane Wyatt, but the two acting pals are fine together, and the real footage - of the battles of Midway and Okinawa - is riveting, as is a low-altitude flyover at the end of the movie by a squadron of Grumman F9F Panther jets.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1381276800,2,1175,5.87719298245614

3911976,5,B002DNLT1Q,"This film obviously has considerable fiction in it.  But the struggle to create naval air power was real, there was a genuine fight between the battleship school and the air advocates.  Col. Billy Mitchell was a casualty of that fight.  Ultimately, the air power clique was successful in its fight.  The on set of WW11 did much to help win the fight.  The combat footage is superb, and I for one hope it is always preserved for future generations. I happen to like Gary Cooper as an actor, so I guess I am somewhat bias on this film.  I recommend this film not just to fan of this actor, but to WW11 students for its combat footage.  It reminds somewhat of the Gallant Hours, the movie about Admiral Bill Halsey.

3911978,5,B002DNLT1Q,"The fight for naval aviation both within the Navy and in the political world, told through the eyes of a career officer/pilot making his way up the ladder of increasing responsibility. The Battle of Midway scenes are the best around. But the movie had a more important purpose - it came at the time Truman, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson and the new U.S. Air Force were trying to seize control of all military aviation, and helped the Navy to hold on until the Korean War put paid to the hack Johnson and the claims of the USAF. Thus the movie is excellent drama and a lot more complex than it appears. Highly recommended.",1365811200,,626,4.5
3911979,4,B002DNLT1Q,"This was one of those films I have loved for years and finally broke down and bought it. It is still as exciting and entertaining as ever. I had one complaint and that is that it is not subtitled or closed captioned. Most of my film watching is done after the wife has gone to bed and in an effort to not disturb her I watch subtitled films. The film itself is great, it's just the production of it on dvd that I opposed.",1364083200,,421,4.023809523809524

All action footage is REAL NAVY COMBAT FILM, in both black and white and in Technicolor.  Real Navy airplanes, with no computer imagery here.  Extremely well scripted and edited.  Super family entertainment that shows factual events that preceded and followed the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7th, 1941.

The movie is a flashback of Gary Cooper's life right beginning at the time he is retiring from the Navy, going over the many memories he had in his struggle to promote carriers and naval aviation, finally to see it at its finest capability, effectiveness, and almost prolific numbers in the Pacific theater, beating down the Japanese air forces and island fortresses. It has some authentic aerial film that you see in most war flicks but still this is a worthwhile purchase to add to your war flick library and an enjoyable film to watch.
