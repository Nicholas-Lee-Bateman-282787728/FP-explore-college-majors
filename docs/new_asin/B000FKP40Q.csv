2570416,3,B000FKP40Q,"ok so it doesn't have star power, most of the world has never heard it before, and it certainly had a limited theatrical release, if any, but ya know what, it's one of those feel good films you watch, and think ""An American Summer,"" is pure American from start to finish. It is grossly watchable, despite its sometimes nauseous teenage sentimental tones.

When I picked this movie up at the rental store, it was nearer to June of my 13th or 14th year, and my summer in a beach resort town was just beginning, and I loved this movie so much, as I could relate as a lost youth coming to a big beach town. I think I kept it for a week or two longer than I should of. Part 'North Shore', part 'Paradise' (Griffith, Johnson), part 'Huckleberry Finn' .

Take your typical lonely boy, Tom, the movies main focal point, all of 14, (looks more 16 in film), displaced from middle America, (Chicago), who goes to LA, after his parents divorce, to what? (cope) and live with his totally-bohemian Aunt (played splendidly by Joanna Kerns of 'Growing Pains' fame) in a beach house. He struggles with accepting this new, laid back lifestyle, but begins to fit in nicely, when he meets Fin (perfect name, for this perfect role, for Brian Austin Green at this perfect age). This budding friendship turn it into a splendid summer, when Fin teaches Tom how to surf, and opens Tom to another lifestyle foreign to Tom. It turns into a summer never to forget with a nice mix of intrigue, falling in love with that sentimental teenage angst, and a barney gone surf fanatic, with some suprising beautiful cinematography, rounds it all off quite nicely, if a bit lame.  Many 'film die-hards' may find this movie extremely lackluster, with trite dialouge, and its overt iconic symbolism towards Mark Twain (boys in this film are called Huck and Fin), however, like Henry Miller said, 'Twain is for adolescents.' Thus is ""An American Summer'. Even with that said, it was hard to pull myself away from it, at 13 years old, and 15 years later. Go remember your beach youth, buy it!

Brian Austin Green, stars in a great role made for him at his age, I assume around 15 at the time, as teenage typical surf boy Fin. He plays the part perfectly, totally stereotypical of how a cali surf boy talks  and acts. It's refreshing to see him in something other than what he was most reknown for, his star role on 90210. He really looks very beautiful in this film, and the camera really grabs that youthful, lusty image well.

I had forgotten about this movie for a decade and a half at least, and to come across it again while perusing through some obscure films, was like a walk down my own memory lane, and the splendid, wonderous summers that I too had, just like Tom did, in his implant in 1990's southern Cali!!",1178064000,9,2778,4.512922465208748

From a southern California girl that grew up in this era, I just loved all the nostalgic references ( Mex hoodiie).

2570494,4,B000FKP40Q,"...that's a pretty accurate description of 1991's ""An American Summer."" When I put the DVD in my player I was kind of skeptical because I just watched the semi-sleazy and mediocre (but sorta likable) ""Costa Rican Summer"" (2010). I was surprised when the story and characters actually captured my attention in the first half hour.

The names of the two mid-teen protagonists -- Tom and (Huck) Fin -- tip-off that this is a modern version of Tom Sawyer, and it's not bad. I appreciate the fact that it lacks the crudeness and sleaze of too many coming-of-age flicks. It's not Disney, but it's good-hearted, fun, and dramatic when fitting.

""An American Summer"" is nothing to get overly excited over, but if you're in the mood for a coming-of-age flick with beaches, surfing, fun, bad guys and misadventures look no further. Joanna Kerns of Growing Pains co-stars as Tom's aunt whom he moves-in with over the summer in the late 70s.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot on the beaches of S. California and thereabouts.

2570496,4,B000FKP40Q,"Patterned after the story of Tom Sawyer, An American Summer is a refreshing look at a young teen dealing with the conflicts of parental divorce, being uprooted for the summer to a place he hated going in, and finding himself along with some great new friends.  In the tribute to Tom Sawyer, ""Tom"" having to spend the summer at a California beach (big change from Chicago) meets up with a new friend, ""Finn"" who helps him adjust to life of beach goers, surfers and dudes.  Naturally there are the typical teen problems involving bullies, divorced parents, and of course, girls, but as the summer progresses, Tom learns competitive surfing, tricking his friends into the modern version of whitewashing a fence, and he and Finn witness an Injun Joe character commit a murder over a drug deal gone bad. For what appeared to be a sleeper movie, An American Summer is entertaining, and a nice summer ride.  Michael Landes plays an honest and convincing Chicago transplant, and a young Brian Austin Green more than accomplishes the role of Finn; the young mentor and guide to the California lifestyle.  This modern day Mark Twain tribute is a good movie for the entire family.",1350777600,,1169,4.800995024875622
