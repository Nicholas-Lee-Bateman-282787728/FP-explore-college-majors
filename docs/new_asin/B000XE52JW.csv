All I want to know is one thing will there be a ""A Lesbian Couples Guide to Sexual Pleasure 2""",1383609600,,214,4.35
8228072,5,B000XE52JW,"This is one of a set of three DVDS that explores the sensate focus exercises created by Masters and Johnson.  I bought the complete set and I will definitely be able to use all of them in my practice.  Each DVD focuses on two couples (straight, gay, or lesbian depending on which DVD it is).  Sex therapists explain the techniques and exercises, what the couple is supposed to do, and what the purpose of the exercise is.  The couples demonstrate each set of exercises and then talk about what they learned and how they felt during and afterwards.

The DVDs are very tastefully done and it seems like the couples really care about each other.  There is a wide range of age and ethnic diversity, which makes it good for a variety of clients.  The production quality is very good.

You can either watch it with your patients/clients or send it home with them for them to follow along and watch at home.  There is enough instruction given that you don't need to be right there with them for it to be effective.  There is also a section that covers both anatomy and the sexual response cycle - very clear and simple for lay people to understand, and helps to set up and explain why the exercises work and what they do.  Overall - a great teaching and learning resource for therapists and counselors.  I highly recommend the set.",1196380800,10,1324,4.493723849372385
