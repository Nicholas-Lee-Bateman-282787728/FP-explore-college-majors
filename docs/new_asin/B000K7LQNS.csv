Madhuri & Anil never disappoint. I went through a whole box of tissues crying my eyes out. KISHENNNN!",1475020800,,260,4.8
8283325,3,B000K7LQNS,"I loved this film when I was really young. The film is pretty silly, but Anil Kapoor put in great perfomances as twins. And Madhuri Dixit can never ever do any wrong. She was great! The music is very good, and the film is quite beautiful. I would have given this more stars but the DVD came scratched so halfway through the film, the DVD began skipping, so I missed a few minutes of the film.",1457913600,,392,4.171052631578948
8283326,5,B000K7LQNS,"This movie is amazing. I watched it dubbed in Russian when I still lived in the former Soviet Union. The culture of the country that I lived it, Uzbekistan, is very similar to Indian culture therefore we often saw Indian Bollywood films. I watched this movie for the first time when I was 2 years old and since then, I can't stop watching it! It's the typical Bollywood movie, but since it is the first one that I have ever watched, it is always going to be my favorite!!",1262563200,,471,4.303370786516854
8283327,5,B000K7LQNS,Oh my gosh I love this dvd.  It has subtitle and the pictures are awesome.  I order this same movie from another website and oh my goodness I was rip off.  The movie came with no subtitle but the cover say so and the cover was all torn and the dvd.  Let's say I think no I know it's a copy caused the back look wierd and there was another a differen't movie copy on there too and I couln't returned it back I was so mad.  So I found one here and decided to take a chance but it turn out awesome and I love it.  If I want anything else I'll just come here.  Thank You so much...,1240963200,,577,3.7583333333333333
