4398075,1,B004KSRML8,"I've been so disappointed with the Harry Potter ""home version"" movies.  I want the embedded extended edition...the same uncut versions aired on television.  The main reason the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings series were hot items is because the cut scenes were placed back into the movie.  They were seemlessly embedded back into the film, not simply ""added scenes"" lumped together as a special feature elsewhere on the DVD.  That's what I hate about the Harry Potter DVDs, the cut-scenes are simply lumped at the end of the DVD.  I'm waiting for Warner Bros. Pictures to get their act together and release a true ""extended edition"" of the Harry Potter series, just like the versions that are shown on television.  When those versions are available for consumers, I'll purchase the entire set!!",1304467200,50,806,4.933333333333334
4398076,4,B004KSRML8,"I was very excited to own the movies that have come out so far, but I was a little disappointed to find that there are scenes missing in these movies.  I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and this is a good deal, I just wish they were all the complete movies.",1303171200,8,251,3.9215686274509802
4398077,3,B004KSRML8,"The reason not to buy this is that they aren't the extended editions that will inevitably come out. If you are like me and are extremely upset at buying a movie and then have an extended edition come out right after, don't buy this or any of your favorites until the extended editions come out. And if you are listening Hollywood, we want the cut scenes IN THE MOVIE, not features to be looked at separately.",1303084800,17,408,4.381578947368421
4398078,4,B004KSRML8,"There is really no reason not to buy this. They are individually wrapped so when the final one comes out just buy that one at that time. The only downfall to this set is that none of them include the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital copy that you can get in the special edition versions.

That said if you want some weird shaped box set in another year then you shoud wait and get that. I prefer the basic style blu-ray covers. They fit into my entertainment system perfectly.",1302825600,5,469,4.329545454545454
4398079,5,B004KSRML8,"I've read a few reviews on this product, and the reviews that had low ratings were because they didn't see why you would purchase this collection.  I understand you probably wouldn't buy this if you already had all the DVDs or even for that matter a couple of the VHSs.  The reason I would buy this is because I don't have a copy of any of them for myself, and getting all of them so far in Blu-ray format is a plus.  Now I know you might think, ""then why not wait until that last part of ""The Deathly Hallows"" comes out, because they are just going to put them all in a box then.""  You have a valid point, but at the same time it isn't that big of a deal to me to get these ones now and then just buy the single when it comes out later.  Either way if you are looking for a collection and want them all in Blu-ray format, and you can't wait until the very last one comes out on tape, then buy it.",1302739200,98,897,3.9065934065934065

4398081,3,B004KSRML8,"I just have one question, Are these the ultimates collection or the orginal films previously released? I am curious because they have yet to release 2 more ultimates and to be honest I would prefer a smaller package with the ultimates than that huge packaging for each of the Ultimate series. And yes I am very dissapointed to find that Ultimates 3 and 4 did not actually have the extra scenes like 1 and 2. Although Ultimate 5 does have them. Obviuosly Warner got the hint when people complained about Ultimates 3 and 4. Maybe Warner should make 3 and 4 over and just sent the extra disc(s) to those people that originally bought the Ultimates 3 and 4. That would show their dedication to the public as loyal custmers like myself. And make up for their oops! I VOTE RE-DO!!!!",1299456000,16,776,4.51063829787234
4398082,5,B004KSRML8,"I bought this box set because it's complete so far. If you want all eight movies, wait for that box set next year. I'm upgrading my dvd set...and this is the most complete set so far. When the last movie comes out I'll just buy that bluray and add it to this set. Simple.",1298160000,10,271,4.037037037037037

4398094,4,B004KSRML8,"Let me start off by stating that I am NOT a fan of the Harry Potter Literature and/or Films in ANY way.  With that being said, I wound up seeing this ""Gift Set"" in a Big Lots oover the last several months for a REALLY GREAT PRICE!!!!  Normally I wouldn't cave in for something I am not a fan of, even at a phenominally fantastic price.  But since I usually bring films to the job I work at and several people have made it a point to regularly ask me to to bring these films in (and I daresay, one actually begged me to get this set).
  So I caved in and bought this set.  Believe it or not, for ONLY $20 plus tax!  Half the price it normally would be.  Frankly, while I do considar the series mediocre at best, I will say that getting 95% of the series for a great price.  And I do find this to be mildly entertaining.  I will give this 4 stars, mostly due to the Price.",1428883200,,870,3.9482758620689653

It was the only single version I was missing. I thought I would buy the whole set and get them all in Blu-Ray, only to have it show up missing the only film in the series I do not have. Now I have wasted my money on this set because I want the whole set together in Blu-Ray. Just checked the price and it is over 60 bucks.

So I was disappointed when I seen a gash on the protective box, as if someone took a box cutter to it. But I could get over that. Its just a box. But when I removed the actual DVD case, it turns out the cut was so deep, it cut the DVD case as well, where you could still feel how deep it went. The gash would bother me and don't feel I should have to deal with that for the amount I played, so I returned it. But I do plan on repurchasing it.",1420329600,,553,3.8596491228070176

Why would you purchase the entire set WITHOUT The Deathly Hallows, Part II?
If you purchased this when it was originally released, my question is: You couldn't rent Part I and wait a few months for Part II?

Although this set is incomplete not having the final part -- it contains 9 discs! There were 2 discs included with extra features for the 6th and 7th movies!  These features discs include the awesome documentary ""A Year in the Life of JK Rowling"" which is a must-see!  It shows JK Rowling finishing the last book and also her life story!  The other discs include special features too!  I am glad I bought this set instead of the complete box set.  I am planning to get the very last movie to complete my collection, the Deathly Hallows part 2 separately with the special feature disc!  Overall, the Blu-ray quality in this box-set is awesome.

Also, there aren't many special feature, but I'm not big on that anyway. All in all, I do feel a little cheated by the missing scenes, but other than that, you get what you get.",1332460800,2,354,4.057142857142857

The set has all seven and is compact...not even my four Shrek collection or my Star Wars edition is as slim as this. Perhaps a small commemorative booklet could have been included, but even without one the set is a great keeper!!!",1326067200,,391,4.36986301369863

Plus, you'll get a bonus DVD copy of the latest movie (with the new movie, not in this box set), in addition to all of the Blu-ray discs.

1.  Buy this out of date box set that has Clearance-like pricing on Amazon, due to it missing the last movie.
2.  But the Blu-ray/DVD combo of the last movie.
3.  Save a ton of money over buying the latest box set that has all of the movies!

I purchased it today for $39.10 American, DELIVERED!. The prices on the UK site are in British pounds and include what is called 20% VAT or ""Value Added Tax"". When shipping to the US, we DO NOT PAY that VAT and it is extracted from your total at checkout. Your log in at Amazon US works in the UK as well, but it is of course a completely separate website. I saved money and got the 8th DVD in the set too. Expected delivery is 12/8-12/13 due to it being a pre-order that does not ship until after 12/1/11. This is worth a look people......  http://www.amazon.co.uk",1321142400,12,716,4.303703703703704
4398193,1,B004KSRML8,Do not buy this DVD set. Several scenes have been cut from each and every movie in set. And it feels like an abridged version.

4398197,1,B004KSRML8,Bought this knowing it didn't have the last disc but it was only $50 so I figured it was worth it. Got the pack and watched the last one with the family. Then we decided to watch them all so I put in the 1st disc and it wouldn't play (disc not readable) took it out wiped it and put it back in. The disc played then started skipping. Replacement- oh no they won't because it's past the 30 days and they won't give you a full refund either. Luckily we contacted Warner Brothers and they sent us a shipping label and had us send it to them for review. The they sent us a new one with a letter sincerely apologizing for the defective blu-ray and hoped that we would buy their products again in the future.

We have watched these characters grow to adulthood and the movies created have stayed true to the books most of the time.  When you read a book you often feel part of the story and these movies have portrayed that magnificently.  The movies themselves have grown with each new chapter.  It is not to be missed.  I would recommend that first you read the books but once you have I can definately recommend you purchase these movies to enjoy again and again.,1320019200,,548,4.3861386138613865

I am guessing the ad must have been changed somewhere along the line for this to be an issue. If it has been updated then I fully understand the discontentment with the product as stated. I would just like an update from ??? to explain it to me. Thanks in advance to any of you that take the time to explain it further.

Is there anyone that can explain a bit more (specific's)as to what difference this collection includes vs. what the other release(s) include. I could sure use more info and maybe there are others that would like it as well.",1317600000,,792,4.315436241610739

4398253,5,B004KSRML8,"I had seen just a few of the Harry Potter movies on television and not all of those in their entirety.  The high definition of the Blue Ray in these movies is very impressive.  Since most of all the films are shot in a studio, or in one room, this is the perfect venue for the Blue Ray.  Buying seven of the films in one package is an exceptional deal.  I will be buying the last film when it comes out in Blue Ray, so I will have the whole set at a very good price.

The three Potter films that I have watched so far have been very good.  Intriguing story lines, fairly good acting, and a pace that pulls you in and along quite well.  The cinematography is good; the costumes are very good; the color is good.  The score is signature and very good but not overpowering.  While I have not read any of the books, if the dialogue is a direct adaptation, then that speaks very well of the written works because the dialogue in the films so far has been very good.  All in all, I view these as adventure stories involving young people on the order of the Hardy Boys and Rick Blaine.  The recognition of evil, confronting it,  and its eventual defeat.",1313107200,,1146,4.1826484018264845
4398254,5,B004KSRML8,"Do I have a different set? Or is it a Yankee thing? Because I live in Canada, and the movies are all exactly the same as they are on the DVD. After reading a few of the complaints, in the subsequent days I went and synched up the blu-ray copies with the DVD copies, and noticed they were all exactly the same. So I don't know what the complaining is about here. Then again, I am in Canada, and maybe things are a tad different here. I will admit after Order of the Phoenix I thought the credits would be in the newspaper style, because thats how i remembered seeing it at the IMAX. Also, I noticed many said there's no scene selection. Um, on my copy there is. On all the films. Just hit ""pop up menu"" on the remote.

As for video quality. Philosopher's looks very soft. Then again, that may be the result of the film being exposed for what it is, as it was shot on a significantly lower budget than the rest. The other films though have a gorgeous filmic grain look over them. In my opinion, Prisoner of Azkaban was the best looking of the bunch. Sound quality is a plus too, as the HD audio really does add a lot here.",1313020800,4,1120,4.137614678899083

We all enjoyed the movies tremendously. I didn't find them too intense for my boys. I think they became a little desensitized watching them from the beginning to the end.

4398257,4,B004KSRML8,"Firstly, I want to note that I gave this a great review because despite a few of the cons that I ran into.. the movies are great and I got an exceptional deal on the set.

As for cons- as noted in other reviews, the volume does seem to vary quite a bit. HP and the Chamber of Secrets was almost inaudible for me without turning my tv all the way up. The quality is upscaled to ""high definition"" on the first movies of course- which doesn't look terrible, but could be better. Mostly, I owned the DVDs independently before deciding to get the box set (yes, I am that HP fan) and I was really disappointed that the menus and intros on the DVDs were different - and lacked the interface that the ""sold separately"" counterparts have. Also, keep in mind that because of the file size of Blu-ray movies- some of the last HP movies actually take up two discs. No fun there.",1312761600,,866,4.248484848484848

I'm dumbfounded that are people who would buy this instead of just waiting for the complete set, and I am saddened (though not surprised) that 1) the industry has so little respect for the consumer that they even MADE this set and 2) it will most likely be a profitable move for them.

4398271,3,B004KSRML8,"THIS REVIEW IS EDITED BECAUSE OF A COMMENT FROM A READER.

THE ORIGINAL:  I am an avid Harry Potter fan.  I own all of the books and movies purchasing as far back as vhs, then DVD and now Blu-ray.  The plus for the set is the Blu-ray itself is beautiful viewing, really clean and lively colors BUT, anyone who has viewed the earlier copies will notice that many scenes have been dropped and others added.  Scenes I notice missing are not even in the deleted scenes.  Anyway, lots of changes I've noticed in all of the movies in this set AND, WHAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT IS, THERE ARE NO SCENE SELECTIONS AVAILABLE IF YOU STOP THE MOVIE FOR OVERNIGHT.  I have hunted thru all the settings and find no way to set up scene selections and so have decided they are non existent.  ALSO, after purchasing a large screen to improve viewing pleasure,  I can tell you the wording in the extras are much too small for reading (our screen isn't the biggest but it is 42 inch) plus the fancy fonts makes reading them even more difficult.  A really poor choice from the developers of this series or for that matter any extras on any DVD.  TO THE POWERS THAT BE, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WE CAN'T SEE THAT LITTLE STUFF AND TO MAKE IT WORSE YOU PUT IT ON PATTERNED BACKGROUNDS.  A real shame for some of us who enjoy the extras as well as the movies.  I had thought about returning the set as there are so many changes in the movies I wasn't sure I was happy not being told of them in the advertising but decided that some of the changes are good overall.  Anyway, that about covers my thoughts on this particular set.  Beautiful to look at but unexpected changes and poorly planned mapping of the Blu-ray for us, the viewer.  For the price they should have included the original movies along with the changed versions so we could make a choice for watching, ALSO THE SCENE SELECTIONS WOULD BE GOOD.  Signing myself, IRRITATED.

THE EDIT:  The helpful comment from a reader was that he had purchased the set and not had the same scene selections issues.  I went back into my set spending a lot of time with the TV Wand and settings.  I discovered that there are, hidden scene settings for these Blu-ray DVDs.  I don't know why they didn't show up and they have been difficult to discover, not an easy format of programming in this Blu-ray set at least not for me.  I have very little problem, usually, and why this particular set is a problem I don't know but I do want readers and possibly buyers to know, I WAS WRONG PER THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE; THERE ARE SCENE SELECTIONS.  Wishing things would always be easier in the programming of the DVD we purchase but guessing it will take more study on my part to discover EASY and proficient.  Thanks for reading.

This is okay to buy, but if you want the best for your movie collection waiting till the end of this year for it to come out is worth it.

(Dec. 4th 2011) Update: After much consideration and time since my original post, which was 6 months ago, I've come to a simple conclusion: just buy a Harry Potter look alike trunk/suitcase, buy all 8 special edition DVDs, and then put the DVDs in the trunk/suitcase, and volia! Christmas present to the super big fan Harry Potter this year! Not only will they be very excited, but they will love the idea and creativity behind how you remember the detail, showing you care about giving this gift.

Also kids will love it because they can pretend and play like they are going to Hogwarts! So maybe this DVDs set above isn't a great idea, but the one I'm throwing out there could be the best one yet in trying to find a perfect Christmas gift for your Harry Potter fan!",1305417600,31,1266,4.24896265560166
4398287,5,B004KSRML8,"So a lot of people asked me why I got this set and didn't just wait for the last movie to come out, but I don't really care.  I didn't have any of the Blu-Rays yet, and the price was so good that I couldn't help myself!  And the extra features and whatnot that came in this box set include some things that aren't in the DVD sets, so it was definitely a good buy!",1305331200,,363,3.8266666666666667
4398288,5,B004KSRML8,Always happy with a Harry Potter movie.  The DVD arrived in pristine condition and in a shrink wrapped package.  The price was incredibly good - $20 lower than the local stores!  I will happily purchase from them again!,1305244800,,219,4.7105263157894735
4398289,5,B004KSRML8,"It is great to have all the movies on disc as published so far.  I cannot comment on the technical aspects of ""moviemaking"", or whether the movies are true to the books. I am just happy to have all of them around to refer to at my convenience.  I have enjoyed the series, my eyesight prevents me from attempting to read all the books at this late stage of my life.  I am a senior citizen, and I still enjoy a good movie(s).",1304985600,,423,4.072289156626506
4398290,5,B004KSRML8,"First, I'm in the process of reading all the Harry Potter Books for the first time ever (yeah, I know, I'm a little behind). I decided it was time ... before the final episode hits the theaters this summer. My plan is to finish all the books, THEN watch all the movies. When the big day arrives for DH Part 2, I'll be in my HP groove. I got my set used at a really great price. I figured, why not? I'll just add the last episode once it's available. Can't wait to get my DVD boxed set!",1304553600,,485,3.9591836734693877

8433391,5,B004KSRML8,"My wife and I love the Harry Potter franchise. We sometimes just have moods where we want to sit down and watch some HP.  I think that the movies were reasonable adaptations of the books. Fanboys hate me if you will, but the casting was well done and there is a reason why many of them are so recognizable, today. We got this at a very reasonable price. The only sad fact is that I got this the year Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came out so I bought it separately from this set.",1449964800,,473,4.086021505376344
