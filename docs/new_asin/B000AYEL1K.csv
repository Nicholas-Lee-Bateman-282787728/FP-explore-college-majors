8080422,3,B000AYEL1K,"We previewed this prior to watching with the kids and felt it was geared for a much older audience than our 7, 5, and 5 year olds.  Wish we would have known prior to purchasing.  I am not a child specialist but would like to see an opinion from a professional as respect the ages that this is appropriate for.  Otherwise, this is a well done video for older kids.",1349568000,,363,4.1571428571428575

8080426,5,B000AYEL1K,"This DVD is for anyone who works with kids of divorce, ages five through early teens. As a Christian, I have looked for a video presentation for almost 15 years finding little to nothing. If you have been disappointed finding something in the ""Christian"" media, you can be assured this secular DVD covers all the bases - Denial, Anger, Barganing, Depression, Acceptance, and Hope. We have been using Trevor Romain's DVDs, which use animation, live action, and wonderful music, for the past three years. Several parents have bought a copy for themselves. Also, for kids in the same age group experiencing Grief due to the death of a loved one, I also recommend the video ""What on Earth Do You Do When Someones Dies?"" Each DVD has a ""live"" session where Trevor speaks directly to groups of children. Mr. Romain, thank you so much for responding to the obvious needs of these hurting kids.

8080427,5,B000AYEL1K,"Trevor Romain and the Comical Sense Company score a home-run with this children's video on divorce. In an area where visual resources for children-of-divorce is lacking, this movie not only takes on the challenge of filling a void, but creates a resource for children, families and schools that has a high ""usability"" factor (Trevor has included a resource guide that is worth the price of the dvd alone).

The characters of Skye and Jack lend a sense of safety through familiarity and approachability. These characters could very well be any child you know. Trevor brings out the vulnerabilities of divorce in a careful but realistic way. He hasn't shied away from the fact that it is perhaps the second most difficult issue for a child to endure, next to the loss of a parent. This is not a watered down, ""cutesy"" movie...as a therapist I was moved by the reality of pain that Trevor was able to capture.

Finally, Trevor depicts Skye's pursuit of finding peace over her parent's divorce in the most creative and cognitively accurate way...I won't spoil it for you. It alone was worth the price of admission.

No divorce is easy, no divorcing parent should believe that a conversation with their child about it will be either. Trevor offers a tool that can help bridge the gap. This movie will not replace healthy post-divorce parent-child interaction/involvement ...in fact, Trevor's gem is just the beginning of the conversation.

A must have for anyone directly involved in the care of children-of-divorce.
