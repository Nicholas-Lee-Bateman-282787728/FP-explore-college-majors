8046173,5,B0007989JI,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Inuyasha and his friends are searching for Naraku. They encounter 3 monkey sprites who get Inuyasha stuck to a boulder. After freeding the Monkey god they learn the direction of Naraku's miasma is confirmed. Afterwards, Kagome returns to her time and catches a flu. Inuyasha nurses her back to health. Kagome's brother is also is a pickle. He is in love with a girl from school, but doesn't have the courage to confess to her. Inuyasha gives him special training to help him man up.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1628,4.441471571906354
8046174,5,B0007989JI,"All the Inuyasha DVD's sell for $19.99 a piece if you go to Best Buy, Fry's Electronics, etc.

Or worst, they sell for $29.99 a piece if you go to Japan town or any China town, Asian place, etc. That is a complete rip off for only THREE episodes, especially filler ones as seen in this DVD.

I paid $2.99 for this DVD a few days ago, and that is the price these DVD's should cost! $1 per episode was worth every cent, NOT $19.99.

Special features include Sketch art, Cast list and Japanese promos like all Inuyasha DVD's which is BORING! The opening theme is ""Owanari Yume (Unending dream)"" and the ending theme is ""Shinjitsu no uta (Song of truth).",1302998400,,650,4.355371900826446
8046175,5,B0007989JI,"Japanese animation has come into American popularity the past few years.  Inuyasha is definitely one of the best.  If you're expecting a typical American cartoon, this isn't it.  Inuyasha is an adventure tale based on a girl who time travelled back to ancient Japan to help a half human half dog demon, Inuyasha, search for fragments of a jewel that bestows its possessor immense powers.  The series has a wonderful sense of humor, some gory parts (not suited for the younger ones under 5 y/o), part romance, part friendship....a magical anime series overall that appeals to a wide range of audiences. This is definitely one of my favorite Japanese anime.",1154390400,,655,4.927272727272728

88 The Three Sprites of the Monkey God
Inu-Yasha and Co. arrive in a village where the fields have been wrecked by monkeys.  The villagers who think Inu-Yasha is a dog god ask him to help, because monkeys hate dogs.  When he meets up with the monkey demon he discovers that they are just little demons like Shippo.  Funny episode, the monkey demons are cute and its fun to watch Inu-Yasha get so annoyed with them.

89 Nursing Battle of the Rival Lovers
On their way to locate Naraku Kagome catches a cold, while Inu-Yasha is out Sango and Miroku tell her to go home and get better.  When Inu-Yasha returns with food for Kagome he is upset to find her gone and heads to her world where Hojo and Kagome's friends are visiting her and he seems to get a little jealous about Hojo.  I like this episode it was sweet Inu-Yasha seems so concerned.  It was sad when he saw the pictures of Kagome and her friends and Hojo was in it.

90 Sota Falls in Love
Kagome and Inu-Yasha are in the modern world and they discover that Kagome's brother Sota is in love with a classmate.  This is a funny episode, I was craking up when Sota was asking Inu-Yasha for advice.  When Kagome dresses Sota up he looks like Jimmy Kudo/Conan Odigawa from Case Closed.

All in all some good episodes are on this disc, nothing happens in the search for Naraku but they are funny and entertaining.  I definitely plan on getting this one.  For those of you who are fans of Inuyasha you should check out Ranma 1/2 or Maison Ikkoku also by Rumiko Takahashi, I liked Inuyasha and so I picked up some of her other stuff and I liked them just as much, especially Ranma 1/2 it's so funny.",1113436800,12,1663,4.32258064516129
