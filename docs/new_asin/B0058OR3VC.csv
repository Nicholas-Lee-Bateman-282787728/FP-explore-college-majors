8462126,2,B0058OR3VC,"I bought this along with DIARY OF A SEX OFFENDER at the Chiller con in NJ because they are the only titles produced under the Cosmic Candy label. These movies are interesting because they're somewhere on the cusp between the safety-net of softcore and things you would normally expect to find in more extreme content - such as some very greedy and hearty groping. This one essentially has the same formula as its relation: attractive women end up at the pad of some deranged artist ( this time a photographer ) and are abused. For this outing, all the women have marquee value ( Lavender Rayne is a NJ based porn-star ), and the sex scenes between the gorgeous Jackie Stevens ( whose celebrated for her big butt ) and the male lead are really hot (because of the use of the natural sound, it really gives off the illusion that they're screwing ). But SEX MERCHANTS is actually the lesser of the two; it's not as dark, and the lead actor - who carries the narrative - is relatively not as good. It suffers again in the script department. The soundtrack, however, is great in a satirical way, and the Times Square montage - including Show World! - is a thoughtful touch.",1463875200,,1168,4.488262910798122
