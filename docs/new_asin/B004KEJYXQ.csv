8432890,5,B004KEJYXQ,"Both DVDs give you a good workout. Both made me sweat. Both Leslie and Desi have a warm-up and a cool down. Even though this particular program (by Leslie) was made about 10 years ago, it is still very effective in giving you a good workout. Desi's workout is very thorough by involving cardio, toning, and flexibility.",1344816000,2,319,4.614035087719298
8432891,5,B004KEJYXQ,"I like the first two workouts on the 3 in 1, but the last one is a little hard to get into the postions. I love the Leslie Sansone. I like all her tapes and use her pilates regularly. This item came very fast and was new. Thanks so much!!",1315872000,,238,3.78
