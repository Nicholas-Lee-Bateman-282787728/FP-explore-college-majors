Far better than even Caballe's  Lucrecia. Sutherland was truely the phenomenal singer of our time.",965692800,11,288,5.085106382978723
8610309,5,B00000JX0W,"Dame Joan Sutherland sings the rol of Lucrezia Borgia with such virtuosismo that one wishes she had sung Elisabetta in Roberto devereux,Maria in  Maria di Rohan and all the Donizetti roles that need a  prima donna of her calibre. In Lucrezia her trills, high notes and  coloratura, as well as the drama in her voice, make the video a must for  all bel canto lovers, and for all Sutherland fans too. Kraus is stupendous  and they both make a superb couple in Borgia.",940723200,55,465,4.554216867469879
