2888729,5,B000SQFC40,"This excellent series spends its sophomore season focusing on the minds of the BAU team members as well as the deviant criminals.  We learn about Aaron's problems at home; Morgan's childhood trauma; Spencer Reid's terrifying kidnaping and subsequent drug problems; Elle relives the terror of her shooting and seeks vengeance on a rapist; and other subtle intakes on the characters.  The regular cast is very good; I will miss Mandy Patinkin, although in some ways his role was minimized this season.  Kristen Vangness as Garcia is a good scene stealer.  Most of the storylines are very disturbing and thought provoking.  All in all, a fine season.",1192320000,19,647,5.066037735849057
2888730,5,B000SQFC40,"These DVDs are widescreen.  I pre-ordered from Amazon, and they arrived on the release day.  I love this show, and I highly recommend the DVDs to any fan.  I am scouting out for easter eggs, but no luck yet.",1191888000,,207,4.256410256410256
2888731,5,B000SQFC40,"This season starts with a bang, following the last season shooting of Agent Elle Greenway, and completes that story arc. The actors are again all in good form and give excellent performances. This is a more cerebral series than most other police/mystery dramas. It centers on the functions of the FBI's Behavorial Analysis Unit (BAU) and its role in solving the most difficult of cases throughout the country. Interesting, believable stories with excellent acting and solid characters make for a very watchable, suspenseful TV show. A very well done drama.",1191888000,37,556,5.188888888888889
2888732,5,B000SQFC40,"Criminal Minds is a great show, it adds depth to what is often a shallow line up of crime dramas. The second season is merely a continuation of what proved to be an amazing first season.",1191801600,4,186,4.194444444444445
2888733,5,B000SQFC40,"First the show is great so im not here for that I see some reviews that say this is full screen,thats not true it is 16x9 enhanced for widescreen I checked it before I purchased it locally and I've watched more than half the series,""they do not make a full screen version of this series""here in the US anyway. Audio is 5.1 DD the picture is really good like it should be coming from an original HD broadcast,so don't fear IT IS WIDESCREEN.",1191369600,4,439,4.301204819277109
2888734,5,B000SQFC40,"For all who seek this DVD in widescreen, It is out there! I purchased Criminal Minds season two in widescreen! Give Amazon a little time, surly they will have this version shorty!",1191283200,,179,4.625
2888735,1,B000SQFC40,Why is the second season released in full screen? The European version of Season One was released in the 16:9 wide version. Will there also be a release of the wide version of Season Two? Because I won't buy full screen. Full screen is the most idiotic idea: chop off both sides of the picture to make it fit on older TVs - less worth for your money.,1190246400,4,350,4.161764705882353
2888736,5,B000SQFC40,i have to say that criminal minds is the greatest show and it is very disappointing that this will be the last season with mandy leaving the show it is not going to be the same. i know that people come and go but that what makes the show so great is because it is a great cast. Let be honest he is the whole show. i love the story plots and great crime tales. i am so excited about seeing season 2 that i want this to be my birthday gift to myself. i know that tv show have been a lot better to watch i have to say but for anyone who is reading this i will be totally honest and this is no Bs....buy the first two seasons of this show it is a must have!! i know that season 3 is a worry but i say give it a chance for me i am going to stick with the first two seasons. i am the kind of person that once the main character leaves then the show doesnt get as interesting just like with millennum and csi ny. i only stuck with the first seasons because they were the best. so right i have to say that criminal minds is a greatest crime show you will not be disappointed and most of all if you like a great thinking kind of show and now like those csi shows where they are just telling you left and right how the crime is being done. i like to be able to think for myself if the show is any good.,1189814400,,1292,3.7536764705882355
2888737,3,B000SQFC40,I just barely found this show and the whole profiling and serial killer thing is very interesting but the show needs work.  AJ Cook is the real reason I started to watch. But they need to do more character developement and this whole mens club thing is annoying.  I want to see more of garcia and especially JJ.  Again I love AJ cook and she deserves to have more screen time. But I'm starting to like the show more and more and now that Mandy patikan is gone I think it will get even better.  Can't wait for the new season so I can see My Girl!,1187740800,,545,4.065420560747664
2888738,5,B000SQFC40,This show has a excellent cast with great writing.  It is not your everyday CSI or shield but a look into the mind of the criminal and how the good guys catch them.  I really started getting into this show after my favorite show of all time (Dead like me) stopped production and I think between the actors and writing this show has many more years of great stories.  CBS really does something different with this show and let me just say I love Garcia!,1185926400,21,452,4.294117647058823

2888746,5,B000SQFC40,This was a very good season of a great show. It starts off with elle leaving. She wasn't my fav character but i loved what they did w her story line. She breaks some rules on her way out. We get to know the other characters a bit more. I love spencer and his mom. And we c more of hotch and his wife. This is gideons last full season and as usual hes amazing. Always brilliant and odd and funny. I will miss him for sure. He was the best. Luckily the show has enough amazing other actors in it that the show will be good still without him. Like prentiss who is new this season and is kind of like one of the guys. Isome great eppisodes this season are the big game and revelations with dawson from dawsons creek playing a surprisingly creepy unsub. Legacy is also really creepy. But like always every epsiode is really great. One of the best shows w the best characters and writing ever!!!!,1493251200,,890,4.180232558139535

Patankin was perfect as Gideon and while the rest of the cast was/is great, he was a major anchor. This second season is no exception and if the price is right, don't pass it up.

2888883,4,B000SQFC40,"this season writers and producers have decided to give us a better look at the people behind the badges. Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini) leaves the BAU after shooting a suspect in a rape case and is replaced with Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster). Dr. Spencer Reed has a mother that is shown to have a mental disorder and they turn him in to a drug addict. Derek Morgan was abused as a child by a man that was like a second father to him. JJ we learn that she is a small town girl from Pennsylvania. Aaron Hotchner we learn a little bit more about his family life including about his father. the only thing we learn about Jason Gideon is that he has an interest in birds and trains, but they give him an arch nemesis in the serial killer known as Frank. owe and  yes people we see that Penelope Garcia does get out from behind her computer screens.
More episode comments this year, only two deleted scenes, more of a view with the real people of the BAU. a really funny gag reel and an interview with Kristen Vangsness or Penelope Garcia.",1419984000,,1035,4.335051546391752

Is your cable guy casing your home to come back and kidnap your son/daughter or you? Believe it, it's happening all over the nation and the writers of criminal minds bring it into the mainstream. Often referencing killers like Ted Bundy, or Son of Sam they solve fictitious cases that may or may not be happening in your very backyard. Believe it, this stuff happens and more than you think. Is it disturbing to watch, you betcha. But, it's also eye opening. This is the show that makes you think.

The writing is solid. The stories are great. The subject matter disturbing. I have had several nightmares due to watching this series and I am over 50.

2888958,4,B000SQFC40,"I just started ordering CM since recently watching every episode whenever it's shown on TV.  I cannot get enough of this show!  Each episode practically keeps me on the edge of my & it's fascinating how the BAU members decipher what's going on through the twisted minds of the individuals they come across on a daily basis.  Although all of the story lines are great, I gave the Season 4 stars due to a couple of the cast members almost boring me to death such as that monotone,  mediocre Mandy who makes it hard for me to understand what he's saying.  Mantegna is a better fit, & I found Lola Glaudini a so-so actress.  I like Paget Brewster better.  I've loved Shemar Moore's acting since his Y&R days, & like the fun chemistry between himself & Garcia.  They're very entertaining.  Also love the acting talents of Cook, Gibson & Gubler.

I understand this is just a television show, but I feel like it shows people just enough to know the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit is an incredibly awesome agency. Digging into the minds of criminals made me think about how our Criminal Justice System works. The first season swept me away from my traditional understanding of criminal investigation, and now the second season has utterly pulled me into the show. I love seeing how each scenario is handled and what sort of consequences befall the criminal. If you're looking for a deeply intense look at the psyche of a criminal, you can't miss with Criminal Minds. A five star show for sure.",1388966400,,744,4.687022900763359

2889034,5,B000SQFC40,"Starting from the Fisher King cliffhanger, the second season of Criminal Minds starts at full speed and never slows down. The second episode is a horrific race against time to rescue a young boy from a pedophile. Reid is kidnapped with traumatic, enduring consequences (allowing us to glimpse his past and relationship with his mother). Elle helps the team catch a rapist and takes things into her own hands. She is replaced by Emily Prentiss, a counter-terrorism expert fully fluent in Arabic (in a terrifying plot to find and prevent a major terrorist attack on American soil).

Morgan is suspected of serial killing, and one of America's most prolific, successful and uncaught serial killers gives Gideon and his team a real run for their money. Hunting Season is probably the most terrifying episode in the entire season. The writers continue to be incredibly creative, even after the exemplary and varied first season.

I really like learning new things for example I kept on hearing the term un-sub but never knew what it stood for, now I know that it means the unknown subject ( the guilty party).

2889092,4,B000SQFC40,I am pretty happy this was Elle's last season. The character was not likable and the actress was not that good. The addition of Prentiss was great and I was glad they wrote the characters as they did (won't say more in case you have been living under a rock and not watched this show). Also....Keith Carradine's guest appearance is one of those that stay with you. My gosh that man plays evil VERY well. The second season is the weakest of all the seasons but its still good. Not my favorite but worth owning and worth watching.,1363392000,2,528,4.3979591836734695

I now have the first 4 seasons on DVD. It sucks you in for good the first time you watch it. I do wish Gideon was still on the show (and Prentiss needs to come back too!!) But Rossi is definitely awesome as well. I rarely get addicted to many TV shows now (and I'm 23) but I haven't been this attached to a show since Friends.

After recovering from her injuries in ""The Fisher King, Pt2"", Elle comes back different, and you have a feeling something horrible is going to happen to her, or that she will lose control and have to leave the BAU. The latter is what happens halfway through the season, and is replaced by Emily Prentiss, who added a great deal to the show. The cases are darker, and Reid goes through hell, and Gideon's nemesis returns. What else could you want?",1357689600,,585,4.634615384615385

It also introduced Emily Prentiss, a character who would evolve to become such an integral part of the group. The evolution of the entire cast truly got going this season and wonderfully so.

Here on Amazon, Fear and Loathing is labeled as The Big Game and is in the wrong sequential order. Fear and Loathing should be after Revelations. It kind of ruined it for me because there  is stuff about Revelations in Fear and Loathing, but because of the order they are in on Amazon, I ended up watching Fear and Loathing first and not having a clue what the flashbacks were flashing back to if that makes sense.",1345680000,9,558,4.524752475247524

I have not seen an episode that didn't have me captivated until the end yet and I am currently watching season 5.  It really helps when the writers research the parts their characters play to bring the show to life, and everytime something happens to a team member or one of their family you really feel the emotions as if it were your own.

They are strong, intelligent and properly posed for this presentation.  I'm not certain if Hotch should pair up with anyone or just remain focused on the team.

I watch on channels 265 and 305 for reruns since not being privy to the local channel it's on.  Anyway, while not an addict, I suspect an obsession to this show is lurking in the back of my ""mind.""  Where's the fan club?  I want pictures.

The characters continue to be strong and to show that this type of job can have the terrifying dangers directed at them also. This job is not for everyone (needless to say) and not everyone stays.

2889315,5,B000SQFC40,"As much as I loved season one, two is even better. While an original cast member leaves, the new character is so much better. I admit to being nervous about the replacement, but I have absolutely fallen in love with the character of Emily Prentiss. There is much more screentime for JJ in this season, which is a very welcome change, also. The Garcia/Morgan dynamic gets more attention this season, as well. We get brief glimpses of our beloved profilers at play and our first real glimpse of how they interact as friends. That's a welcome change from typical television, which usually has the female characters sniping and competing against each other. I rather enjoy seeing professional women that can manage to not feel threatened by each other's successes. If you just let the show take you where it wants to, then the ride will be quite enjoyable. Some of the content can be horrifying to some viewers but this show wouldn't be doing justice to the crimes or the real Agents that pursue the criminals if the content weren't as real as the networks will allow them to make it. That's why this show is one of only two shows I have as appointment television every week. It's an awesome show and it just keeps getting better.",1212019200,,1226,4.628440366972477

2889363,5,B000SQFC40,"I just finished the 2nd season of Criminal Minds.  I love it all the actors in it and the various ""unsubs"" that show up in each episode especially the season ending episode.  That marks the return of serial killer from someone in the BUAs past.  I like how the different characters have certain areas of expertise from a genius (Doctor) to tech genius (Garcia) love her character to one that drops down an interview and has more connects with newspapers and police than i've ever seen.

Also enjoy the profiling of the suspects that they do in each episode and also the various dramas and highs and lows that each character in the group goes through from being kidnapped to coping with the aftermath of said kidnapping.  Hitting bottom and making their way back up.  I just love each and every episode.  I can't help but get into the stories with the way they are written and guest stars in Kate Jackson (Emily Prentiss') mother.  I hope the next season continues to bring it like the 2nd season has.  I know i won't be disappointed.

The only bad part is i have to wait for season 3 to come out on DVD which isn't really i'm just really wanting to see how the third season opens up for everyone in the group.  Excellent actors/actresses all around in Mandy Patikin, Shemar Moore, AJ Cook, Kristine Vangness and all others as well.  They work together great as a unit and that's what makes the show click for me.

Bring on more Criminal Minds please.

2889365,3,B000SQFC40,not one that I can say I enjoyed. Elle is written off the show after her life is saved and she acted like she soooo wanted to get back to work. A new girl that you can only warm up to by the end of the season. One of the rescued victims that were rescued in the first of the season is killed in the end which is disappointing. The episodes themselves seemed more like horror flicks than something ripped from headlines. I KNOW alot of these shows could happen but who wants to watch it!,1195516800,,486,4.072916666666667

Mandy Patinkin makes the show and I am really sorry to hear that he will no longer be there. I'm not sure that it will be nearly as good sans Mandy.
