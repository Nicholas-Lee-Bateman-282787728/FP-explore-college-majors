5923893,5,B00EJUXNOM,"This is a very effective, very positive and yet oddly disturbing movie about the fitful coming out of a 40ish gay priest in Poland. His name is Adam, and he looks nothing like a priest except while on duty. He's always known he's gay, but he's serious about his vocation and has stayed closeted in order to keep his vows of celibacy.

He has a special gift for helping troubled teenage boys, which his superiors value greatly. His homosexuality has never led to anything remotely inappropriate with a boy (or with a man, for that matter), but he is periodically transferred in order to keep even rumors from interfering with his very valuable ministry. Most recently he was moved from Warsaw to an isolated rural parish with a small work-home for boys on furlough from reformatories.

This is a complex movie, and trying to summarize its plot would be a disservice. It is not predictable, not typical of gay movies, of priest movies, or of any other sort of movies I can think of. It's not the story of a type of man but of THIS man. So, like any real human being, Adam is more complicated than a normal movie character, and the director does not try to make him easy to understand.

In part because it's NOT predictable, this movie is fascinating to watch, and the end is especially satisfying. The movie is disturbing not because of anything that happens, but because everyone and everything in it looks dirty.

I know that sounds superficial, but sometimes the most superficial things in life are the most distressing. Even after bathing, the characters look grimy, everything indoors is dingy, and outdoors is nothing but dust. I don't know if rural Poland really is as miserable as this movie makes it appear, or if the director was intentionally creating a disturbing ambiance for the movie.

Although it's disturbing, that ambiance adds to the complexity of the movie and enhances its effectiveness. I watched it twice; it was richer and even more satisfying the second time.",1397865600,9,1982,4.75
5923894,5,B00EJUXNOM,"I was not expecting such a beautiful and complex film. Other reviews will give you a synopsis, but I want to reiterate that the film is grounded by a remarkable performance from Andrzej Chyra. While some critics have questioned the seeming disconnect between the beautiful filming, atmospheric soundtrack, and sequences of brutality and violence, I do feel this is exactly the point the director, Malgoska Szumowska, was trying to make. Life is hard and joy can be fleeting.

Adam's growing sense of isolation and loneliness betrays the limits of his religion when confronting his desires. He only wants to love, really, but the constraints of his chosen profession and an often brutal society make this a challenge (to say the least). The symbolism can be pretty heavy at times (Lukasz as Jesus is kind of unsettling), and the ending felt contrived, but overall this movie moved me.",1397606400,4,883,5.006802721088436
5923895,5,B00EJUXNOM,"Adam is a young Catholic Polish priest that is mysteriously sent from Warsaw to attend to troubled boys in the countryside. The small town emphasizes the loneliness and the absence of privacy in the lives of the residents.

Father Adams method is to interact with the teenage boys with positive messages, soccer and volunteer work. All have troubles with families, drugs or sex. Therein lays Father Adams problem in that he is struggling with his own sexuality, particularly when admired by a local women that he has to politely turn down for affection.

Some of the boys are real trouble and threaten Father Adams mission as a role model. He also witnesses bullying and sexual interaction amongst the boys that is edging him towards an uncomfortable revelation. He befriends a quiet empathetic boy who defends him and also requires personal his attention.

The tension of some tragedies mixed with personal feelings of loneliness and aggression work in a balanced way that continues to surprise from beginning to end. Nicely directed in a non-glossy fashion, this film will surprise, delight and ultimately give you pause on the directions of the characters lives.",1396656000,11,1165,5.0890052356020945
5923896,5,B00EJUXNOM,"Spoiler Alert
Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska accomplishes an outstandingly effective, brave examination of Catholic priesthood with all the inherent difficulties both within the life of being a celibate priest in a time when the world's eye is focused on the abuses within the Church. She wrote the screenplay with Michal Englert who also is the cinematographer. The film succeeds not only because of the sensitivity of the script but also because of the extraordinary acting by several of the members of the cast.

Adam (the brilliant actor Andrzej Chyra) is a Jesuit Catholic priest who discovered his calling as a servant of God at the relatively late age of 21 and has been transferred to many different parishes - the reasons are not completely clear. He is a kind, warm, caring and committed priest who truly cares of this flock. He now lives in a village in rural Poland where he works with teenagers with behavioral problems who fight and yell abuse. He declines the advances of a young brunette named Ewa (Maja Ostaszewska) saying he is already spoken for: Ewa is the love reason Adam's associate teacher Michal (Lukasz Simlat) left the seminary and never became a priest. But celibacy is not the only reason for his rejection. Adam knows that he desires men and that his embrace of the priesthood has been a flight from his own sexuality. When he meets Lukasz (Mateusz Kosciukiewicz, the director's husband), the strange and tongue-tied son of a simple rural family, Adam's self-imposed abstinence becomes a heavy burden. He hears the confession of a teen who has had a same sex encounter elsewhere and when a new addition to the camp Adrian/Blondie (Tomasz Schuchardt), the lad is seduced by Blondie and the result is the lad's suicide by hanging. Lukasz sustains a beating and seeks Adam's solace and healing at night, and that innocent tender encounter is observed by Michal. The Bishop is alerted and Adam must leave for yet another assignment. He is followed by Lukasz and at last Adam's quandary is at least for the moment resolved.

The film is rich in metaphorical scenes - a Skype call between Adam and his Toronto based sister shares Adam's desperate need to have someone to hug, Adam turns to drinking and in his altered state he drunkenly dances with a photograph of the Pope - his only allowed passion, a funeral scene for the fallen lad, and a mesmerizingly beautiful religious celebration parade full of overtones. The film may for some be too huge in character depth and audiences more attuned to action based movies it might be too slow and deep and fragmented. Were it not for the brilliance of Andrzej Chyra's Adam the film may even offend some. But the total experience of the film is deeply moving. Grady Harp, April 14",1396483200,4,2756,4.836864406779661
5923897,4,B00EJUXNOM,"In the Name of is another grittily realistic offering from Film Movement.  A Polish film with English subtitles, it is the story of Father Adam, a Catholic priest who is stationed in rural Poland.  Among his duties is the counseling and supervision of a group of troubled teen boys who are on remand from the state reform school system.  Adam is a young man who came late to the Church and the priesthood, and he relates well to the teens and to the community.

Father Adam himself is a deeply troubled individual, however.  He faces innumerable challenges dealing with the teenagers and with his other duties in the community, but those pale compared to his inner struggles.  He finds it easy to dismiss a woman who seeks a sexual relationship with him by telling her ""I'm taken,"" but it is far more difficult to deal with his feelings towards the young men with whom he works, especially an enigmatic new arrival named Lukasz.

Father Adam's struggles are sympathetically told with respect for both him, the young woman, and the teens with whom he must deal. The ending is somewhat equivocal, which is appropriate considering the quandaries into which Adam finds himself plunged with no hope of finding answers.  In the Name of's troubling story is enhanced by the beautiful photography and superb acting.",1396051200,12,1307,4.829596412556054
5923898,4,B00EJUXNOM,"Priest Adam works with problem boys/lads in a Catholic Church programme in rural Poland. He was moved on from a similar parish in Warsaw under a bit of a cloud. He works with Michal who dropped out of the Seminary for love - this love is Ewa who clearly has the hots for our Adam. Meanwhile he tries to do `good' by the boys who are an unruly bunch to say the least. Then a new boy turns up who is nicknamed `Blondie' - he is elf assured, striking and gay and about to upset the established order - after all `you do not confess to the priest but to God'.

Meanwhile another one of the boys who is a bit of an outside and has the nickname `Humpty' seems to need a little more `spiritual guidance' than the other boys. Well the summer heat rises and so do the hormone levels. Adam is also seemingly fighting an alcohol problem; and it is not long before cracks in the fragile set up start to show. The consequences of what takes place will have repercussions for all those involved.

This is a very gripping film throughout and it all unfolds at a rather slow pace, but it is hard to notice. I actually thought at one point that this is like watching a car crash in slow motion - but in a really good way. The scene shot in slow mo with the soundtrack of `Band of Horses' is particularly memorable and will make me listen to the album again. There are issues here that go beyond mere sexuality and as such this is a layered film that has repressed feelings and love at the very core of what it is doing,; I can absolutely recommend - especially for lovers of gay themed films.",1393459200,2,1575,4.194719471947194
5923899,4,B00EJUXNOM,"I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, and am a subscriber of their DVD-of-the-Month Club. This is the September, 2013 release in that on-going series.

""In The Name Of..."" (2013 release from Poland; 102 min.) brings the story of Father Adam, a Catholic priest who has been transferred from a parish in Warsaw to a parish in the country-side of Poland, literally in the middle of nowhere. There he heads a center of troubled teenage boys, who will be sent back into the (presumably much harder) state system if they don't behave. Adam struggles with loneliness, as he takes confession after confession, but he himself has nowhere to turn with his troubles, other than the occasional contact with his faraway sister who lives in Toronto. Adam fends off the advances of a young woman Ewa, telling her that yes he finds her attractive but ""I'm already spoken for"". Then Adam strikes a bond with one of the troubles teens, a boy named Lukasz. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is a complex priesthood/troubled youth drama that addresses a lot of issues, none more so than the loneliness of Father Adam. At one point he is Skype-ing with his sister in Toronto when he is feeling desperate. He asks her ""Do you have someone to hug? I need someone I can hug"". The movie does a great job walking a thin line between true desperation and sheer overkill. The photography in the movie is outstanding, filming it in a sun-drenched way (sometimes reminding me of magic-realism). The acting is also superb, none more so that the Polish actor in the role of Father Adam. And any movie that finds a place for Band of Horses' ""The Funeral"" (in is pivotal moment of the movie, no less) gets extra brownie points. But wait! there is more! As is always the case, the DVD has a bonus shortie, and this month we get ""Summer Vacation"", a 22 min. shortie from Israel that is equally delightful, just watch!

Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with ""In the Name Of..."", and this is yet another worthy addition to the ever-growing and rich Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies.

5923915,5,B00EJUXNOM,"I absolutely loved this movie. The pathos of the main character, Adam, the priest sent to some backwater Polish parish as penance for a vaguely defined  inappropriate action with another young boy in his previous posting. The atmosphere of the parish is made more than clear as the various characters in the movie, Adam, Ewa, and Luckasz, are all struggling with the boredom and loneliness of the backwater, rural community in Poland. I agree with an earlier posting that described the cinematography as being almost like magical realism. The sunshines everywhere filling the whole community with light and warmth, a light and warmth that is sorely missing from the lives of these people. Father Adam -- a nice twist on the name as representative of all mankind -- finds himself fighting, and in some cases, losing his battles with loneliness, boredom, and temptation of the flesh. Clearly he is succeeding in establishing a loving, supportive community for the young men who live in this village. Yet he is also fighting a losing battle with his own innate sexuality, a sexuality that he recognizes clearly for what it is: he is a gay priest. Eventually, as things must in a movie of this sort, his battles with himself are overwhelmed by the need for love and affection and compassion that he eventually finds in the character Luckasz, another lost young man who quickly bonds with the priest and then sees their relationship become much more serious. After a series of unfortunate events transpire in the story, left here undescribed to avoid spoilers, the priest Adam is forced to transfer to another parish, allowing a new priest to come into the community and take over where Adam has left off. The young men of the community are clearly losing a stalwart defender of these young men and their education and development into adults. Luckasz is so distraught at losing his ""lover"" Adam, that he burns down the community center that had beed built by with the support and intervention of Father Adam. Without him, the keystone of the boys club has been removed and the whole edifice now comes tumbling down in ashes. The one aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was the ending. So many foreign gay movies seem to think that the only possible ending for a gay film is for the gay to die, or the relationship to be destroyed, usually through some acts of violence or homophobia. Refreshingly, this movie took a turn in a different direction. I won't tell you the ending, because you will want to see it for yourself. But it is not as dire as you might first expect after viewing how things had developed in the community with Father Adam's absence.  All in all, I really thought this Polish gay film did a super job in depicting the bleak, often hopeless lives of these poor people eeking out a meager living in some rural community in Poland. But best of all, it showed an alternative possibility for how this situation could be turned for the better. I'm not sure the final scene in the movie was actually necessary. In my opinion, the movie could have ended just before this scene. I get the idea behind the continuity of gay men becoming priests, particularly in a place where there are not many other alternatives. Yet, the fact that this is what would absolutely, without a doubt happen under these circumstances is not an argument that I buy into. I think it was overkill and superfluous to include that scene. But I""m open to others who might try to convince me I am wrong. In any event, the movie is definitely worth viewling and tells a story that is very likely happening on a daily basis in some parts of the world as we speak. For that reason, it is an important story to tell and one I enjoyed watching in this movie. I felt that the acting was excellent, even among the many minor characters surrounding the protagonist and those closest to him. The storyline was completely credible, the cinematography was beautifully filmed, and overall, the film is definitely worth your time.",1424649600,3,4002,4.715714285714285

The portrayal of a Catholic priest by Andrzej Chyra, whose name is uniquely Adam, is powerfully authentic and particularly domestic to the rural area, to which he has been assigned. The supporting cast was selected with care and almost diamond-precision. Winning the Teddy Award at the Berlin International Film Festival was indeed almost a foregone conclusion.

The established Catholic church was a thousand years old before it definitively took a stand in favor of celibacy in the twelfth century at the Second Lateran Council held in 1139, when a rule was approved forbidding priests to marry, but not to procreate. In 1563, the Council of Trent reaffirmed the tradition of celibacy, which forbade any act of procreation. It is this dogma, which is defined as a religious doctrine that is proclaimed as true without proof, that man has problems. God commanded twice to ""go forth and multiply"". However, the writer Michal Englert advances the principles of the dogma from the heterosexual to the homosexual, which explodes onto the scene in rural Poland.

I find these kinds of movies more involving and ""real"" in the way that they show how a gay character or characters interact in life. So many gay movies suffer a artificial quality that make their characters seem contrived and unrealistic. Such films don't convince because they seem too gay, in a way that appears unnatural.
I'm heartened to see that there is a new gay cinema with movies like ""Free Fall"", ""A Stranger by the Lake"", and this film that offer a much more convincing feel for life that is neither artificial or overly ""campy"".

It would not be giving away too much of the storyline to say that ""In The Name Of ..."" is an indictment of church dogma, as it is impossible for any gay man to live an authentic life within the confines of the Catholic church.
It would be easy to say that--in this Pope Francis-era--the film takes a sympathetic view of the dilemma of the gay priest; however, it is important to realize that Catholic church dogma has still not, and will not, change., and unfortunately gay men will continue to go into the Priesthood as a means of burying themselves more deeply within the closet.",1403654400,2,929,4.470588235294118

The only reason for 2 stars instead of one is because I thought the acting was quite good.  The short subject (which also was about homosexual men) was better than the feature imo.,1401148800,,481,4.129032258064516
5923936,4,B00EJUXNOM,"Interesting story, great ensemble, different approach. I thought this was really worth the time, and enjoyed the strong point of view. Great end.",1400716800,,145,5.3478260869565215
5923937,3,B00EJUXNOM,"Beautifully filmed but for me a tough subject... If you know you are an alcoholic and don't want to drink, why are you working in a bar?
And please don't say it's not that easy... being a alcoholic and working in a bar isn't easy either...
Also sorry if I offend anyone, but GOD is Everywhere... inside, outside, all around, EVERYWHERE... why choose the most difficult path?",1400198400,,374,4.597014925373134
5923938,5,B00EJUXNOM,"It seems to me that foreign gay and lesbian films in general have a leg up on their American counterparts. This beautifully filmed and acted drama is no exception. It is the story of a handsome but ultimately lonely priest who runs a small group home for male delinquents in a rural farm community in Poland. One would assume he would fall for one of these boys. More than one as it turns out, would probably welcome his attentions. But instead he falls for a taciturn and troubled young local man who is the son of local itinerant farmers. The young man has become a mascot for the rough but good natured boys of the home. This is not the story of a pedophile priest the boy seems to be well above the age of consent, but is rather the story of one man's profound loneliness and isolation even at the center of an active small community in a job that really does have meaning for him. Again, the film is shot beautifully in the changing light of a summer sun, and reaches a heartwarming, if ultimately ambiguous, conclusion.",1400198400,5,1025,4.428571428571429
5923939,5,B00EJUXNOM,I was very impressed with the overall quality of this film.  I also found it respectful to the church and the struggles that faithful men have.,1399680000,,143,4.5
8606129,5,B00EJUXNOM,Great movie about forbidden love in Poland,1529884800,,42,5.142857142857143
8606130,2,B00EJUXNOM,"'GOING MY WAY"" it's not.
I found it mostly to be a combination of pouring molasses from a jar, and the proverbial ""watching paint dry.""
Vile, vulgar, profane, sadistic, beer guzzling, but :""loveable"":teenagers (boys will e boys, after all) are being monitored or perhaps guided by a priest (uh, oh!) and a layman.  It's possible that this is an example of plot being lost in translation, but this Polish film was, for me, confusing and almost pointless.  There is a subplot about a character named ""Grovy,"" who, even after I went back to find him, I have no idea who he was.and why he was so significant.  (And how did this out-of-the-way place get so many flashlights?)  Some of the photography is so dark, and other shots are maybe supposed to be symbolic.  I get that the priest's issues are realistic,  For me, his story, as presented, was not very interesting.",1529798400,,865,4.695364238410596
8606131,4,B00EJUXNOM,"Wow. This movie said a lot. It was nicely done. It is controversial, but on many levels it is real. The symbolism with  ""Humpty."" He didn't really speak - he was silenced by the stuffy religious culture and homophobia. The only annoying thing was the sex-starved woman (cliche). I wish they had told us the age range of the kids. I felt uncomfortable with the priest and Humpty. Regardless of Humpty's age, the priest was an authority figure. On the other hand, the age of consent in Poland is 15 - and Humpty was certainly several years older than that.",1528502400,,554,4.54
8606132,2,B00EJUXNOM,"This film has not reached its full potential. Szumowska's narrative is chopped and haphazard. Abrupt cuts are not as artistic as they are distracting in preventing full immersion in the story. Further disconnect is achieved by no less than three different musical styles. If she settled on the string music of Mykietyn, she would have achieved more cohesion, but instead she throws in another composer (electric guitar), and then a pop song in English. How is that for complete confusion? I found the plot opportunistic and the ending gratuitous. I understand that the LGBT themes and criticism of the Christian church are fashionable at the moment, but these topics in and of themselves do not guarantee good cinema. The only aspect I found engaging was the performance of Andrzej Chyra who portrayed the priest.",1520899200,,813,5.074626865671642
8606133,5,B00EJUXNOM,"The poignancy of this film, watching it a few weeks before Christmas 2017, leaves me feeling lost and bitter. The Polish people have always been rabidly Catholic, anti-semitic and homophobic but now, under the present government the hatred is magnified and spreading across Europe.

There is nothing about this production that passes as average. It's beautiful in it's sadness, in every way. I'm surprised there hasn't been more critical acclaim.",1511827200,,446,5.371428571428571
8606134,5,B00EJUXNOM,I enjoyed it; even though I wasn't aware that it was going to be an indictment of certain Catholic priests.  But the telling of Adam's personal Hell was incredibly engrossing.,1496361600,,175,4.833333333333333
8606135,5,B00EJUXNOM,"I thought the movie was very well done.  My 5 star rating isn't based on a Hollywood production, but a rating for a very well done, low budget, indie type film.  I thought all the actors did a wonderful job...they all fit their roles and were all believable as their characters.  The movie was in Polish, so I'm sure some things were lost in translation, but the point of the story was strong.  This is basically a story of a priest struggling with his own identity...and how the church moves men like this around. While he wasn't the aggressor, per se, ...his role in the church made him one.  What I took away from is that some of the victims were actually the manipulators of the situation (not blaming the victims...just stating they found the weakness in the priest and use).ed it).  I found the end of the movie an interesting surprise...in the sense of how the cycle will continue.

This is one that I may watch again to see if my opinion stays the same...often in subtitles movies I miss stuff (like body language and ""looks"" from other characters not prominent in the scene.",1493164800,4,1083,4.523076923076923
8606136,5,B00EJUXNOM,The film shows a very complicated issue in relation to the Catholic religion on priests and their sexual inclinations. good movie.,1477612800,,130,5.238095238095238
8606137,1,B00EJUXNOM,Horrible. Stop watching after 10 minutes. I would have given it 0 stars if that was possible.,1477267200,,93,4.529411764705882
8606138,3,B00EJUXNOM,"Another reviewer said, quite accurately, that this movie should get two stars for the first half and four for the second half. It gets off to a slow start and it's hard to tell what's going on and who's who, at first. But the second half is powerful.",1476921600,,250,4.229166666666667
