 Thought provoking audio interviews from some of today's most brilliant and respected military investigators, scientists and physicists. If the Ministry of Defence is curious about UFO's and abductions then perhaps we should sit up and take notice! Where do UFO's come from and what do they want? How many different groups are coming here and are there agendas different? Where can you go to for help and why you? Are UFO's using Black Holes to travel the vast distances of space? Have they harnessed 0 Point Energy as an power source? Animated with an advanced computer graphics software to create our still images of UFO's, exotic worlds and outer space animations. Visually stunning CG images & animations. Compelling soundtrack. Perhaps by expanding our imagination the truth won't seem so strange.
