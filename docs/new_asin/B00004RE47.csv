Thankfully, the fight scenes are plentiful and entertaining. Also, the two sisters are very attractive and they both know how to fight! Overall, worth watching once.",1511654400,,282,5.0212765957446805

7921365,3,B00004RE47,"THE MAGNIFICENT KICK (1980) is notable chiefly for being one of a handful of later Hong Kong films to feature Kwan Tak Hing reprising the role of Wong Fei-Hung, the legendary herbalist and martial artist (1947-1924), whom he'd played in a series of 99(!) films from 1949 to 1970. Kwan's later appearances in the role included two films directed by Yuen Wo Ping, THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER (1980) and DREADNAUGHT (1981). Today, of course, Wong Fei-Hung is most famous to modern audiences for being played by Jackie Chan in DRUNKEN MASTER and DRUNKEN MASTER II and Jet Li in the first three films in the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series.
Kwan appears only in the first 25 minutes and puts on a kung fu display that's quite impressive for a man then in his 70s. The rest of the film follows two of Wong Fei-Hung's students as they get involved in a feud between a pair of sisters and a renegade General, leading to a series of scenes in which the older sister learns Wong's ""magnificent kick"" and joins Wong's students in tackling the General in an all-out kung fu finale. Jason Pai Piao (HELL'S WINDSTAFF), a worthy if underused kung fu performer, stars as the senior student, while Wong Hang Sau (who excelled in SHAOLIN MANTIS opposite David Chiang) plays the older sister and proves to be quite an underrated female fighting star in her own right. Veteran performer and action director Han Ying Chieh plays the murderous General. The plotting is awkward but the fight scenes are very well-staged. This tape is hard to find these days, but is worth a look by dedicated buffs if only for its link, through the participation of Kwan Tak Hing, to the earliest roots of kung fu cinema.",1041292800,,1678,4.634228187919463
