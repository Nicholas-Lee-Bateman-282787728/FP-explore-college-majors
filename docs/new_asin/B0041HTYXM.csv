It so much more fun to have them go through the MET or the National Gallery in DC and many other museums across the country and have our 3 seven year olds and 10 year old recognize artists and tell others about the artist.  They are much more willing to go to art gallerys and have a much better appreciation for the art,  because of the the DVDs and the books.  Its fun to hear them tell other adults and children what a Relief is or who is in the painting and who has painted it.  I believe there favorite artist is Michelangelo, they love watching him, and telling others about him and recognizing replicas in the US.  They also love seeing the paintings at the end of where the art is located and put it on there bucket list to visit that museum.  We have had these DVDs for 2-3 years and watch them frequently.  You have made art fun and interesting for children and adults.  Thank you for using your talent!!",1452211200,,980,4.225806451612903
8614523,5,B0041HTYXM,"""Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists"" is one of the most memorable fun tools for learning about the artists. I have used these to enforce the different styles that are presented in my middle school art classes. My students have consistently enjoyed these for many years.",1343606400,2,279,4.957446808510638

They have taught us so much and have inspired our son to be a 'serious artist' that he wants to paint at home every chance he gets. He also recognizes various artist's works now when we are out and see a random Van Gogh or Monet. The artists lives are presented so well and with so much humor that the details are truly memorable. The films do a great job of explaining how each artist developed from a young child, to teen to adult artist which makes these great artists approachable and gives children an understanding of how skills develop as you get older. And, though laughing hysterically at times, I learned more remarkable facts about Michaelangelo from the DVD than I did on my trip to the Vatican and Sistine Chapel. The few difficult details of some artists lives, Van Gogh for instance, are handled extremely well, with care not to ignore the facts but to handle them in a way appropriate for a young audience.  We also really like how the  end of the film tells you where the art works featured in each film can be seen. My son now wants to go to the National Gallery of Art because it holds so many Van Goghs and Monets. I cannot say enough about how enjoyable and educational these DVDs are for children, teens, and adults too.  I highly recommend them, especially for school art classes of all ages, and look forward to more releases.",1299974400,6,1459,4.396296296296296
