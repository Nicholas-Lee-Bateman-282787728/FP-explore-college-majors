They arrived exactly as the picture shows. Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. All DVDs and good quality. Thanks again for the selling of this item.

8297980,4,B001EEVO1U,"When the Ninja Turtle craze first hit the kids in the mid to late 80's, i was one of them who just could not get enough of anything to do with this show. But as years went by, you tend to forget your childhood favorites and wonder if you would still like them today?

Well, purchasing season 1 brought back so many fond memories, and the show still holds up well today. It hasn't aged with time, and I believe if they made a series 11 to this series, it would still rate, sell and make fans happy.

The quality if the shows are not polished up, and you do see speckles and flickers of dirt, but I remember seeing that when they first aired anyway. And as a cartoon, as long as colors don't fade or you see a VHS tracking line in the way, or that annoying audio cutting in and out, then it doesn't bother me, and none of those things are found on any of these dvd's anyway.

Currently there is the first 8 of 10 seasons released. Each season a little different in some way to the other, the first season comes with bonus features of 4 episodes from Series 10 that where never seen before on TV. There is also a few bonus features on certain season discs with how the turtles where created, interviews, and things like that. On the series 6 box they made it into a Pizza box, series 7 comes with small figurines of each of the turtles on the 4 volumes to it, or you can skip that and buy the whole series 7 together without them. So it's great to see the original TMNT series isn't being mistreated, and the fans are enjoying picking up each season to bring back memories, or even get to see those episodes they may never have seen, and see where it all ended up going.

Nothing seems to be missing either, no cut episodes, no song changes, nothing like that. It seems to remain the way it is, which is so refreshing to to find out as way too many old TV series coming out on DVD these days have some sort of edit or changes to them.",1253577600,6,1931,4.127659574468085
