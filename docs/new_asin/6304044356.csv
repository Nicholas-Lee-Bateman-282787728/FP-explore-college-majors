Megami Paradise is an all female anime with cute music and where everyone is a Goddess (though I thought the main characters were angels honestly with their villain counterparts being fallen angels). To really understand this OVA, you have to watch the first one. Alas, I don't have the first OVA so I can only go by summary. I never understood why Lilith was held in such regard if she's the damsel of distress but the first OVA apparently showed how powerful she was.

But the second OVA opens up with the Goddesses preparing a ceremony and then the Dark Goddesses interuppting them and kidnapping Lilith leaving Rurubell to stay behind while Stasia and Juliana go save her (and that doesn't end well for them either because they get captured).

The plot is very generic and its not the main girls that finish off the villain...but even then, the villains aren't as evil as they could be and no one dies in the end.

I give this episode a 5 out of 5 because it's still fresh in my mind especially the opening Get My Way and despite the series only having two OVA episodes, during this time period, I thought it was unique for an all female cast only with no males in sight.",1362441600,3,1357,4.330708661417323
