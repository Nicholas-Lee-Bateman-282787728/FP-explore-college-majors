8361309,2,B002BEXF8W,"As mentioned in the other review, this DVD skips in one of my Sony DVD players. It works on my computers and a different Sony DVD player. I cannot find on the [...]website so I cannot complain to them

As for the footage, The Lost Concert is 2 cam and poor quality. The performance is fine as Steve is not drunk but for die hard fans only.

The Astoria footage is professional and great. Frampton is in great spirits as is Ian McLagan. It's enough to make me want to buy the whole thing, and it saves this release.

Bottom Line: die hard fans only. Beware that you may have problems on your DVD player. If I could complain to the company, I would!",1289692800,5,647,4.201612903225806
8361310,4,B002BEXF8W,"A great DVD concert for Steve Marriott/Humble Pie Fans.  From the DVD case, here is the info you probably wish you had if you were worried about buying this without any info (Barnes and Noble had some of the info on their webstore).  This is the Steve Marriott Band recorded live at the Dragon's Waldcafe Dudweiler in Saarbruecken,Germany, 10 October 1987, produced by ABC-Entertainment.  When you play the DVD, the title says ""Steve Marriott-Live in Germany.  As bonus feature/extramaterial, their are highlights from the Steve Marriott Astoria Memorial Concert, recorded at the Astoria Theatre, London on 20 April 2001.  Additional extras include Steve Marriott private footage (a couple of minutes of probably 8mm video at Marriott's home around the early Pie days; there's about 15 seconds from this clip in the Life and Times of Steve Marriot biography DVD (highly recommended, but for some reason very expensive now?).

Here are the songs from each concert:
The Lost Concert (1987):
Band = Steve Marriott on Lead vocals and Guitar, Richard Newman on Drums, Mick Weaver on Keyboards and Jim Leverton on bass guitar.
Some Kind of Wonderful/Can Iget a Witness

Tin Soldier  (Paul weller/Noel Gallagher/Clem Archer/Ian McLagen/Jerry Shirley/Steve Ellis/Kenny Jones)
All or Nothing (Paul weller/Noel Gallagher/Clem Archer/Ian McLagen/Jerry Shirley/Steve Ellis/Kenny Jones)

I like this DVD because it has the Marriott Band at an intermediate period between a couple of the other concerts available and also my favorite selections from the Astoria concert, of which I have the whole concert on 3 CD set (I still plan on getting the Memorial DVD as well).  The only downside to this DVD may be that it's a DVD Ram Disk which would not play on my Home Theater DVR, but it does play on my PC Flatscreen monitor (which has a built in DVD player), on my PC, and also on a DVD player in another room (not sure what's up with the DVR).",1287187200,12,2662,5.0709382151029745
