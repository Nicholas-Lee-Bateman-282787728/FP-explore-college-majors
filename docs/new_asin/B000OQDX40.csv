Having an original artist with unlimited talent dance and parade was just a thrill not achieved easily just by any movie. These movies are treasures of the ages.",1404777600,,178,4.741935483870968
8186357,5,B000OQDX40,"Growing up, pretty much all I knew about Josephine Baker was of a vaudeville entertainer, a beautiful black woman, in the 1920's, who wore nothing but bannanas around her waist.  I knew she was some kind of erotic dancer in Europe but didn't know much more.  Older now, I know that I could not know much more because she was never really accepted as an entertainer here in the States and probably because of the prevalent racism here at the time.  And now, well, that was our loss.

She went from rags-to-riches under the most trying of circumstances.  From living on the streets in St. Louis, to vaudeville in New York and erotic dancing in Paris, films in the 30's and to working for the French resistance during WWII.  These three films represent that period, in Europe, in the 30's just before that World War.  Films that were never well-received here in the States.  And contain some of the most sensual talented dancing by one of the most influential entertainers of that time.  Because of Josephine Baker, many more talented black women were able to follow in her success, and rightfully so.",1394323200,4,1098,4.677083333333333

Perfect if you're as in love with this woman as I am....GET IT.",1368662400,3,179,4.294117647058823
8186360,5,B000OQDX40,"Enjoy the beauty and elegance of Josephine Baker in the three volume set of her on film: Zou Zou; Princess Tam Tam and Siren of the Tropics. Her creative power was like that of a highly strung cheetah - unstoppable! For me some of the racism was painful to observe but serves as a historical context for viewing the works of one of the most famous first female African Americans on film.  Her life as an entertainer, dancer and social activist* can be seen her through her work and be utilized as a jumping off point to do further research on her wonderful and tragic life.  *By this I mean that she paved the way for other black actors, dancers and entertainers and made many things possible that would not have occurred prior to her entrance upon the stage or on film.

8186361,4,B000OQDX40,"THE JOSEPHINE BAKER COLLECTION from Kino Video contains the silent film, SIREN OF THE TROPICS (1927, French), with orchestra score; and two legendary sound films, ZOU ZOU (1934, French) and PRINCESS TAM TAM (1935, French).  Baker was an exuberant and uninhibited cabaret singer and dancer at Paris' Folies Bergere who sometimes only wore bananas and feathers on stage.  These three film classics are a lot of fun.

SIREN OF THE TROPICS has a prospector sending his employee from France to the Caribbean, where the employee falls in love with Papitou (Baker), a free-spirited jungle animal.  The duo find themselves back in Paris, where Papitou is the star of the Folies Bergere.  She slowly becomes aware that her lover is betrothed to another woman.  With exotic color tints, SIREN is sensual and entertaining.  It ends with Baker doing the Charleston.  This was her film debut.  She was already a Folies star.

ZOU ZOU teams Baker with Jean Gabin and marked Baker's talking film debut.  It is kind of like 42ND STREET, with Josephine the exuberant ingenue taking the place of an arrogant and undependable lead dancer in a Paris revue.  The classic climax has Baker dressed in feathers and singing the unforgettable ""Haiti"" while on a swing inside a giant bird cage!  In none of these three films does Josephine end up with the male lead, instead finding show business success.

PRINCESS TAM  TAM is set in North Africa, where an author with writer's block uses Alwina (Josephine Baker) as inspiration for a PYGMALION-like novel.  But his wife thinks he really loves Alwina and sets out to make him jealous and Alwina look stupid.  The dazzling musical numbers here include ""Dream Ship"",  ""'Neath the Tropical Blue Skies,"" and a champagne-laced nightclub climax dressed in just a negligee.  Again, I think Alwina ends up a Folies star in Paris and the author goes back to his wife.

All three of these movies have a Josephine Baker 20 minute conversation--""The Performer,"" ""The Woman,"" and ""The Films.""  Commenting are beautiful actress Lynn Whitfield (THE JOSEPHINE BAKER STORY), drama critics Elizabeth Kendall and Margo Jefferson, and Baker's adopted chef son.  The two sound films have isolated song selections, while SIREN has several fun bonuses.  THE JOSEPHINE BAKER COLLECTION has beautiful prints and offers an enjoyable three nights of entertainment.",1181001600,26,2361,5.091145833333333
