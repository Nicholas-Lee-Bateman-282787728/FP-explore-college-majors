5787175,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I am a huge Bob Harper fan - love his style. I am pretty fit. I did the Strength DVD first and it was a great workout. I felt it a little the next day. I did the Cardio DVD on day 2. It kicked my butt while I was doing it. And now, on day 3 I am struggling to get in and out of chairs. I have not been this sore since who knows when! The Core DVD will have to wait until I am mobile again. Superb workouts!!!  Fast forward 1 week (as I am updating my review)...I love these workouts. I'm a little confused about other reviewers who are saying they are too short. I am doing all the Cardio WODs in a row. The next day I do all the Strength WODs. I suppose if I only did a single WOD, it would not be a sufficient workout. But combine them and it's killer. I look forward to the break between the WODs when I have need to advance the DVD. I'll agree that the warm-up is not super inspiring to me, but I'll just substitute my own warm-up going forward.",1371772800,7,949,3.8418367346938775
5787176,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I love Bob's workouts and I do P90X/Insanity as well.  When I heard he was releasing new videos I hopped on the train.  I love a good Bob workout!  These are no joke!  I'm only on the 2nd day and feeling them!  I was able to keep up with Bob's athletes but was panting and sweating the whole time.  Can't wait to get through them!

I've just done the cardio workouts and they are broken down into intervals.  You do 2 min hard work then get 1 min  of rest (or more, depending on how fast you can get through them).  You do 5 or 6 rounds of 2 or 3 exercises, depending on which cardio workout you do.  I assume the core and strength are similar in nature.

Also, where can I get the WORK & SWEAT T-shirt?",1371513600,15,703,3.9784172661870505
5787177,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I ve done a bunch of Bob's workouts from his online fitness club, so I'm familiar with his workout style.  This is the best workout dvd I've ever bought!  I especially like that there's a completely separate Ab workout!  Id definitely recommend this for any of the ""skinny rules"" fans.",1371168000,13,285,4.66
5787178,2,B00DBFBVCW,"First, let me say that I love all of Bob Harper's previous workouts so I ordered these right away.  I just received this shipment today and was very disappointed with the packaging.  Each DVD is in a thin cardboard sleeve with an opening on one end.  No usual protective DVD cases here.  Over time, I can see the DVDs getting scratched from taking them in and out of the sleeves.  Come on, Bob and Watch It Now, you couldn't spend a few more cents for regular DVD cases?  Looks like I'll have to make that investment myself if I want to preserve the life of the DVDs.  In addition, the description provided here on Amazon says the DVDs comes with a 30, 60, and 90-day calendar workout schedule.  My package only contained a 30-day calendar so now I'll have to waste my time figuring out how to get the other two calendars.  I can only hope the poor quality of packaging is no reflection of the workouts!",1371168000,11,903,4.359281437125748
5787179,3,B00DBFBVCW,"All 3 workouts were very similar, I got bored. They were hard but I expected more from Bob, I have his other workouts and they are much better in my opinion. I wish he would work out with the exercisers on at least one DVD.",1397174400,,223,3.977777777777778
5787180,5,B00DBFBVCW,"While I'm not the most in shape person that ever lived, I would say I am more so than the average American.  I don't have issues with food, either.  I'm also one of those people that takes on way too many projects, so I don't have time to devote to going to the gym or attending a group fitness class for an hour or more.  It's just not possible.

I did another 8-week DVD program before I tried Skinny Rules...I saw very little results with that previous program.

I was surprised at how much these workouts kicked my arse!  I love it!  With continuing to eat well and following the Skinny Rules calendar faithfully for four weeks...I dropped 4 pounds and at almost 30, my abs never looked this good.

Like I said, I'm already pretty active...I'm a professional belly dancer and I study Taekwondo, but this workout was that missing piece of the puzzle to really get me where I want to be.  I have more energy, I'm stronger, I'm seeing muscle definition where I've never seen it before...I'm so thrilled with these DVDs.

I'm also not one to be bothered with leaving reviews, but I felt that this warranted one for sure.

I've read some mixed reviews from other people...and like with many things, it's all subjective.  What you will get out of these DVDs is directly proportionate to the effort you put in.

If you're already super-fit, then these probably are not going to give you any more than you've already got.  If you're like me and relatively fit, but looking for that extra boost?  Then, I think these are the right DVDs for you.  Learn to LOVE squats ;-)",1396828800,2,1565,4.477031802120141
5787181,5,B00DBFBVCW,As always Bob does what he does best and his new Cardio DVD is worth every penny - the crossfit workouts are shorter but he still makes you feel the pain ( in a good way) if I have one minus it's the music but.... I play my own music so it's ok - simple workouts but very effective,1394668800,,281,3.7796610169491527
5787182,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I have been doing Crossfit for over a year now.  I had heard Bob Harper was really into Crossfit as well so when I heard these workouts were similar to crossfit workouts I decided to try them.  They are really good workouts.  On days I'm too busy to make it to the gym I can pop these in and get a quick, sweaty, heart-pounding workout.  Lots of burpees :)  Really happy with these DVDs.  I would highly recommend.",1393027200,,414,4.243589743589744
5787183,4,B00DBFBVCW,"I bought this DVD with high hopes.  I popped it in my trusted DVD player to find out the DVD didn't work.  I tried it in two other DVD players to find that it still didn't work.  I contacted the seller immediately and a new, working copy in days.  The DVD worked, and the video workout was what I expected.  This workout beats his biggest loser workouts videos even my husband does it.  He didn't like working out to DVDs; now he does.",1392940800,,435,4.180722891566265
5787184,1,B00DBFBVCW,"If you spend $30 on a set of dvd's you at least expect some kind of a box, but no all you get is a thin cardboard sleeve for each dvd. Very cheap indeed. Very disappointed as they are a xmas present.",1386460800,,199,3.761904761904762
5787185,4,B00DBFBVCW,Love Bob Harper and this workout! its like cross fit but very doable ! I would reccomend to anyone. I'm 61 and got through it,1386374400,,125,4.04
5787186,5,B00DBFBVCW,"Best DVDs I've tried....and I've tried a lot (P90X, Insanity, Chalean, LesMills Pump, Bobs other DVDs, Jillian Michaels). These seem to be the shortest, yet most effective use of my time!  You cannot beat the price compared to the beachbody sets. This set is worth much more!",1386028800,,275,4.851063829787234
5787187,3,B00DBFBVCW,"I've bought all of Bob's other work out DVDs. I really like him*.
I love variety in my collection and really have been challenged by his previous programs. Moving into the cross fit arena is great for Bob but not so great for me. I found these workouts really challenging but not as dynamic as others. I understand the concept of cross fit, I have lots of friends that are mad for it but doing the work outs over and over again (as you generally do with DVDs) they're just not floating my boat as much as others in my collection.
Look, my body was sore the next day, I struggled to bend etc so they certainly pushed me but I'm not going back to these DVDs as much as I usually would.
*Side note...as usual everyone is super hot and ripped in these DVDs, which is a great motivator.",1385251200,,781,4.213333333333333

5787189,2,B00DBFBVCW,"I own several of Bob's and the Biggest Loser workout DVDs so I'm familiar with that format. However, this workout was boring and you DO NOT need to spend $15 to do a squat for 15 minutes.

First workout:
1. Squats
2. Rest
3. Burpees
4. Rest
REPEAT for 14 frickin' minutes!

Yeah, you'll sweat. Or just find a workout in a magazine or something and do that. Simple.",1379721600,4,364,4.260869565217392
5787190,5,B00DBFBVCW,"Thank you Mr Harper!!!
Bob Harper continues to deliver quality products.  The workouts are short and simple but very challenging.
I recommend this product to everyone.",1379462400,,167,5.423076923076923
5787191,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I have long since been a curious researcher of the crossfit style of working out.  I have all of Bob's other DVD's and have done them on a regular rotation in my regimen.  I was not quite prepared for this.  After the first Cardio workout, my legs were so sore that I had a hard time getting in and out of a chair the next day.  I ride bikes and run so that was definitely a first for me.  Then, the second one came and again, my legs called me lots of ugly names the next day.  I have found all the workouts to be equally as punishing/rewarding.

I like the style and make up and the time they take.  I love the way they make my body work and earn what I'm striving to achieve.  These workouts are not for newbies.. I warn you... work your way to them and watch yourself improve!",1378684800,3,780,4.012987012987013
5787192,5,B00DBFBVCW,I love these workouts...short workouts that kick your butt!  I actually look forward to working to these DVD's...I had a had time getting into the DVDs that are an hour long. Oh and I really like Crossfit and these are like those workouts.,1378425600,,239,4.558139534883721
5787193,5,B00DBFBVCW,I am only on the cardio workouts and boy do I feel it!! He delivers a great workout in such a short time. My body was so sore the next day! I can't wait to get into the other workouts!,1377648000,,184,3.625
5787194,4,B00DBFBVCW,"Shorter workouts here are great to add to your other routines, but what I have always loved about Bob Harper is...Bob Harper. The 45 to 60 minute workouts that lead you through a full head to toe challenge of change for your body AND mind. Bob, come back! These are good, but my heart skipped a healthy beat when I saw you had more videos..these I can add, and I understand they are ""The Skinny"" rules...and that's just keepin' on keepin' on moving with changing it up. I got it, but don't you love we are all begging you for the hour of work? Kinda sick, but your great.",1377648000,,571,4.247706422018348
5787195,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I am 49 years old and this work out is really tough.  Burpees are so hard for me and I struggle to finish, but I figure every one I do will help me get fitter and make the next work out a little more manageable,  I love the calendar that lets me know which workout to do.  I have not been diligent about working out over the last 6 months and these are really hard, but you can tell they are so effective.  Work every muscle in the body in a really short amount of time.  Consistency is the key and building up to fitness just takes patience and work.  No short cuts.  Nutrition is another challenge, but the difficulty of these workouts make me think more about what I am eating.  Good luck!!",1376697600,,693,4.119402985074627

These are fast moving, hard and you get results fast.  It has been years since I have been this sore and I am leaner every day.  These are for people who want to work very hard and be done in twenty minutes but it is not for the weak hearted.  Once again, Bob is king of getting it done fast and right!",1376611200,3,448,3.8369565217391304
5787197,5,B00DBFBVCW,Hey customers if you want a good introduction to the sport of fitness(Crossfit) this is the guy and the workout. Bob uses all the exercises and method used in Crossfit. They are short but intense workouts so if you think 15 mins is short you are wrong he is working the whole body and most of all giving you modifications and correct guidance on each workout.for those who don't know Bob Harper is a new enthusiast of the Crossfit sport and thank God he came with a good set of workouts!.,1376179200,,488,4.373626373626373

5787200,3,B00DBFBVCW,"I really enjoy the cardio workouts, however they are very short.  I feel personally that the strength workouts do not isolate the various arm, shoulder and back muscle groups; I followed the program exactly and have lost most of the definition in my arms and shoulders. The core workouts are not easy to modify for someone like me, I cannot do even 1 situp and the core workouts require more abs than I have.  I like Bob Harper and enjoy his previous longer 'endurance' style workouts.  I will definitely use the cardio workouts on days when I need a quickie workout.",1374278400,2,567,4.594059405940594

5787203,5,B00DBFBVCW,"These will be some of the toughest workouts you ever do.  15 minutes of weighted squats and burpees is a killer workout and that is just one workout on these dvds.  Bob Harper is tough.  I have all his workout videos.  There is a bit of a dread factor with these because they are so tough, but these workouts will push you to the next level.",1373673600,3,341,4.121212121212121
5787204,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I have been working out ""with"" Bob Harper for about three years.  Started with his Biggest Loser series and worked up to Inside Out Method.  The cross fit style of The Skinny Rules is great and seriously kicks my butt. I like the shorter workout time but believe me just because they are short doesn't mean you won't be pouring sweat and dying on the mat.  Love these workouts and I Love Bob Harper.",1373587200,3,399,4.364864864864865
5787205,5,B00DBFBVCW,"Bob Harper never disappoints. The Skinny Rules DVDs walk you through each exercise in the circuit giving careful instruction for form. As always Bob is there to encourage and motivate you. I didn't think I would sweat during a 15 minute workout, but I did and felt amazing afterwards. The works are doable for the home enthusiast! Thanks Bob Harper.",1372636800,3,349,4.833333333333333
5787206,4,B00DBFBVCW,"I normally don't write reviews before I complete a program/book/etc. I've completed week 1 of Bob Harper's Skinny Rules Workout series. So far I've done all 4 Cardo WODs (Workout Of the Day) and 1 Core WOD per the calendar included with the DVDs. Months 2 & 3 work-out plans are free on Bob's website.
So far the Core & Cardio have the same 11 minute warm-up; and warm-you-up it does! I was breathing heavy after the warm-up! Although it seems repetitive day after day the time goes by quick and I have noticed it is easier after one week. The work-outs are only 10-20 min long but boy they make you SWEAT! They are Cross Fit style where you only do 1-3 different moves and either AMRAP (as many reps/rounds as possible) in a set amount of time - or you repeat the moves 6-7 times in sets. I promise its a high-energy work out in a short amount of time. If you have 30 minutes you can complete a solid work-out.
After 1 week I have not lost any weight or inches -yet. I'm following The Skinny Rules recipes -although my dinners don't always follow the Rules exactly. I'll update my review as I progress. I'm definitely going to follow one month of this and hope to lose inches & pounds! From there I may do 2-3 months, we'll see.
UPDATE: Almost done with week 3. I've done all 4 Cardio & Core WODS and 1 Strength WOD per the work-out calendar. These give me a work-out! Most Core WODS involve V-ups (a sit-up where top and bottom come up to meet in the middle), flutter kicks, and weighted squat thrusts. Core 3 involves side planks variations, flutter kicks, V-ups, and some others in 15 second increments. All work-outs are fast-paced, high-intensity, heartrate-ramping, and fat-burning. The sweat will pour off of you. I did Ccre 4 WOD yesterday and today my abs are killing me today. My weight is about the same (121 lbs at 5'2"") but I attribute that to enjoying summer BBQs with 1-2 drinks about twice a week. Per my weekly measurements I still have not lost inches in my waist, hips, arms or legs. I have visibly noticed my quads getting much stronger from all the squat variations in these work-outs.",1372204800,7,2107,4.447028423772609
5787207,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I purchased these DVDs with anticipation of great workouts and I did - These workouts are crossfit based, with means short intense workouts.  These are not like his older workouts that are long.. Research has showed that you get more bang for your workouts if they are short and intense and these are!  The only thing is I wish these were digital so I could put them on my Ipad and bring them places. My house is too small to do these workouts in. Please make them digital - it would be easier to use anywhere --everything is going digital -Apple doesnt make disc drives in their computer anymore -- and Jillian Michaels' videos are on Itunes -- Just sayin' Bob;-)
.",1372032000,3,666,4.450819672131147
5787208,4,B00DBFBVCW,"These workouts are not like any of Bob's other workouts.  They are more like cross fit workouts.  And I really love all of Bob's other workouts - they are hard, 45 minutes to an hour long of sweating and real heart pumping workouts.

The actual workouts are from 8 to 15 minutes long. Add Warm up which is 11:24 minutes (and the warm ups are the same on all dvds)...missing Cool down?...  You repeat the moves for each section - which would only be 2 to 3/4 moves/exercises.  It is an add on at best with your workout routine.

Here you go...

Warm up 11:24 minutes
Inhale and exhale, reaching overhead
Lateral bends while holding arms overhead
Reach arms back, arching back and looking up
8 ""Inch worms"" (bend at waist, walk hands out so that you are in a high plank, lower your body to the ground and arch back into cobra; turn your head right then left then front, walk hands back to feet and stand)
Alternating front lunges (each time you lunge you will hold in a deep lunge with arms stretched overhead)
Forward bend and walk out into down dog
While in down dog lift legs high behind you, stretching hips
5 deep air squats, slow and controlled
Hold in deep squat then stand up fast and powerful-do that twice
Hold in deep squat then explode upward-jumping-do that 4 times
Jump rope for the last 1 minute and 20 seconds

7/5/13 Strength - These workouts are starting to grow on me - I do like it for an add on.  The segments are about 15 minutes each and I do get pretty sore from it.  But remember, I am using this as an add on.  I do my 45 to 1 hour workout and then add this on at the end for a little more.  So the moves are different from what I have been doing so it really is confusing my body to change.  Which is the whole point, right!

Strength:
#1 - 15 minute AMRAP (as many rounds as possible {about 12 rounds done this workout})12 reps per workout
Moves:  Single Arm Dumbbell Snatch(left 6 reps and right 6 reps)
  Dumbbell Suitcase Deadlift
  Dumbbell Thrusters

#2 - 17:40 2 Sections of 30 seconds of work and 30 seconds of rest, 4 rounds each section.
Moves:  Section 1 - Dumbbell Hang Squat Clean, Dumbbell Push Press
  Section 2 - Goblet Squats, Hand Release Pushups
#3 - 15 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 4 minutes to the total time (19). This WOD consists of 3 rounds. Each round contains 4 exercises and one rounds lasts 4 minutes. The first 3 exercises are done for 45 seconds with 15 seconds of recovery and the last exercise is 60 seconds of jumping jacks.
Dumbbell thrusters 45 seconds on, 15 seconds recovery
Dumbbell push press 45 seconds on, 15 seconds recovery
Dumbbell front squats 45 seconds on, 15 seconds recovery
Jumping jacks 60 seconds
After 3 rounds of these exercises, you immediately do 3 burpees, then straight into 1 minute and 20 seconds of dumbbell thrusters, then immediately into 45 seconds of dumbbell front squats and you end the WOD by holding a deep squat isometrically for 30 seconds.

WOD 4: 12 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 4 minutes to the total time (16). Of all of the WODs this is the only one I genuinely did not like. It is very hard, but it was also painful and I will go so far as to say it could possible cause some repetitive movement injuries. It is based on AMRep-as many reps as possible in the time allotted and I will say that by the end my shoulders were in some serious agony. You repeat two exercises for 12 minutes, non-stop, as many rounds as you can push out. I hated it and I will probably never do this WOD again. Just to be clear-I love all the others and will probably come back them frequently. The two moves are single arm push presses and goblet squats. One round is 10 single arm dumbbell push presses (10 each arm) and 10 goblet squats. However, before you begin the rounds, you do 30 burpees. The clock starts when you start the burpees. As soon as you finish your 30 burpees you jump straight into your AMrep of rounds. When the 12 minutes is up, he brings you right to the ground for about a minute of push ups.

Core Workouts: - Bob labels them as WOD - Workouts of the Day - there are 4 WOD for Core
#1 8 minutes- 2 sets
15 reps of Front Dumbbell Squats
  30 seconds of Hollow Rock
  30 seconds of Flutter Kick
Then 1 minute of Un-weighted Squats and Plank for 2:17 minutes

#2 - 7:40 minutes - 3 moves - You get 30 seconds per exercise to complete and 3 rounds of this:
  15 reps of Sit Up - feet together knees apart
  10 reps of Goblet Squat
  10 reps of V-ups
then Speed Goblet Squats for 30 seconds for 3 sets with a 15 second Rest between squats

#3 14:20 - 4 moves - 15 seconds per move and 5 rounds
Here are the moves:  Flutter Kicks, Hollow Rocks, Side Plank hold left and Side Plank hold right.

#4 15:10 - 3 moves - 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 start with 50 and move down in reps
Moves:  Kettlebell Swing, Sumo Deadlift High Pull, V-ups

Cardio:

WOD 1: 14 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 2:30 to the total time (16:30). This is pretty simple, but also pretty intense. Two moves-burpees and air squats. You do 12 burpees and 25 air squats. You have one minute to do each and you alternate them. The faster you complete the exercises (with good form ) the more recovery time you get. I managed to do my burpees in approx. 30 seconds, so that gave me 30 seconds of recovery time and my air squats took me a little longer-35-40 seconds, giving me about 20 seconds of recovery time.

WOD 2: 18 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 2:30 minutes to the total time (20:30). You do 6 rounds of 3 exercises. You get two minutes to do each round, then rest for one minute. The sooner you finish, the more recovery time you get.

Rounds 1 & 2 consists of 30 mountain climbers, 10 burpees, 15 jumping goblet squats; Rounds 3-6 consists of 60 mountain climbers, 10 burpees, 15 jumping goblet squats.

WOD 3: 16 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 4 minutes to the total time (20). Each part is done the same (except part two has stuff added to the end). You do each exercise for 45 seconds with a 15 second recovery. You do two rounds.

Part 1-do two rounds 45 seconds on, 15 second recovery
Jumping air squats
Hand release push ups
Tuck jumps
Part 2-do two rounds 45 seconds on, 15 second recovery
Burpees
Dumbbell push press
Jump lunges
After the final jump lunges you go immediately into alternating front lunges for a minute and 30 seconds, then hold static lunges-approx 20 seconds each side.

WOD 4: 8 minutes; if you do the WOD with the breakdown, the break down adds 4 minutes to the total time (12). There are two moves: dumbbell thrusters and burpees. The format is a little odd, but you get the hang of it quickly: 10-1, 1-10.
You do 10 dumbbell thrusters, 1 burpee.
Then 9 thrusters, 2 burpees.
Then 8 thrusters, 3 burpees... and so on until you end with the count reversed: 1 dumbbell thruster and 10 burpees. If you are going the same speed as the exercisers you will finish in approx. 6 minutes. You get about 30 seconds to recover then the last 90 seconds he has you doing nonstop dumbbell thrusters for speed.

8591264,5,B00DBFBVCW,"I have many DVDs from Bob. I purchased the 5 DVDs for this series! As in all other DVDs Bob will leave you sweating and your body will still be working even after you are done!
This is a great workout and one my favorites in the series along with the Cardio DVD. This is created as a Cross Fit type of workout. You work out for 15-18 minutes and do a series of total body work exercises. This workout is intended for you to work at a high intensity for the entire 15 minutes or at intervals (tabata style). Both ways are great and you will be working at a high intensity. You are focused on counting reps, on time or both and don't think much about the work you are putting in. Because you are trying to get in as many reps as possible, you work hard at 85% of your heart rate.
This DVD does exactly what it intends to do - you work out at a high intensity to get the desired after burn.

I followed Bob's program for a month, but now I incorporate this workout with a 30 minute workout to get the after burn effect. I notice a huge change in my body!
Also, I love Bob's voice! He is so calming even when you are working at high intensity.",1455494400,,1139,4.0176211453744495
8591265,5,B00DBFBVCW,One of the best workouts and they are less than 30 mins,1440460800,,55,3.6666666666666665
8591266,2,B00DBFBVCW,"About me: I work out 5-6 days a week, lots of Gillian videos, am in pretty good shape and am always looking for new and interesting workouts to add to my rotation.  The pros: the exercises are whole body moves and I did work up a sweat so you're getting both cardio and strength in a brief workout.  The exercises don't take much space, always a plus for those with tiny living rooms like me.  The warm up is nice but too long at 11 minutes (let's call that a neutral). The cons: the exercises are incredibly repetitive and so, so boring.  In one of the four workouts, you're doing the same two moves over and over again for the entire duration of the workout.  I understand that the goal is to really fatigue and change the body quickly but these workouts left me unnecessarily sore and the minimal number of moves meant that my mind wandered and I wasn't as motivated as I would like to have been.  Am definitely giving this one away.",1422403200,3,936,4.32
8591267,2,B00DBFBVCW,"Disappointing at best. I have purchased at least 4 of Bob's workout dvd's and honestly this is the worst. The routines are repetitive and boring. Normally I am pumped about Bob's routines but this one did nothing for me. The workouts are 15 minutes each with about a ten minute warm up.  I consider myself very active and in great physical condition. I run at least 3 times a week as well as competing in 5k and 10k races and half marathons, so I was looking for a challenging workout to add to my routine. I didn't find that with this set.  The only good thing is that I didn't pay for it, ( I had amazon credit). These dvd's will end up at a garage sale. Buyer beware. Sorry Bob!",1417824000,,681,4.190839694656488

8591270,4,B00DBFBVCW,"I love these workouts. I recently had a baby and have maybe 45 mins a day that I can dedicate to working out. These are quick (all under 30 mins including the warm up) and do a great job of kicking your butt in a short time. The best thing is that there are many different workouts so you don't get too bored and on days where you have more time you can stack them for a longer workout. I don't think anyone would necessarily lose a ton of weight or get ripped doing these workouts alone, but they pair well with a good diet and help maintain a healthy weight if you're already there and increase cardio and strength in a short amount of time. My only beef with buying them here is that I did not realize that you can get the entire 5 disc DVD set directly from the Bob Harper website for about 5 bucks more -- wish I had realized that before buying so I'm a bit annoyed with that (the reason I deducted a star here), but I do love the workouts and am considering buying the other 2 DVDs directly from BH.",1408406400,,1005,4.055276381909548

8591273,1,B00DBFBVCW,I am bewildered by the positive reviews for this product.  You essentially do the same two or three exercises over and over again of 14 minutes. It is incredibly boring.  I would recommend you find a better product. Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30 is really good.,1398384000,,262,4.673913043478261
