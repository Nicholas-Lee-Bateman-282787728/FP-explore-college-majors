8193035,3,B000PS5TZ8,"A difficult movie to review, made harder because it's in very limited supply online. I first saw part of it on TV years ago, and missed the ending. It's a story that needs the ending to be seen. Roula, a young woman managing holiday cabins on the Danish coast, has been systematically abused by her father, the local handyman, since she was young. Her best childhood friend died as an indirect result of Roula's father's attentions. How dark do you like your stories? Well, as the film gets moving, he shows growing interest in the young daughter of a guest at the cabins. And Roula develops, against her will, a liking for the child's widowed father.
How the pair come to terms with a relationship, given Roula's background, and what happens when the older man's misdeeds come into the open, are the essence of the tale - and why, once started, you want to see how it ends.
A good story, and no doubt better for those fluent in German. I'm not. It held up well enough, but the dubbed dialogue was not the best example of its kind.
First time I saw parts of it was on an ""art house"" movie show on TV. Yes, it made good use of symbolism - fire, for instance - and Roula came across as one push short of killing herself until love stepped in. But, not helped by the dubbed dialogue, I think this movie was better in my memory than in the viewing.
Now I've seen the whole story, it will sit in my collection for quite a while until I am in the mood for something dark again.",1300838400,,1471,4.294964028776978
