3517077,4,B001CR49HK,"Like most British literary series of the 70's, these stagings are short on dazzling set design & cinematography, but are very well-costumed and have plenty of period costume eye-candy.

The scripts are tight and, judging from what I remember about the original James books, faithful to the stories' basic themes. When you condense a novel down to a 50-minute play, as they do here with ""The Wings of the Dove"", some finer points will get lost but the gist of the story is expressed well.

A great part of the satisfaction of a series like this is to see actors as they were back in the day. Diana Rigg, Jeremy Brett, Patricia Routledge, Margaret Tyzack and Anton Rodgers are a few of the actors who are better known for other work. If you know Routledge only from her work on ""Keeping Up Appearances"", her younger self here will be a nice surprise.

For some people, the pace of these episodes may feel slow (I felt that as well) but I would say that you should just accept that and relax into the different pace of story-telling. This series is a nice way to spend a couple of hours.

3517078,5,B001CR49HK,"I bought this series, at first for Jeremy Brett, who plays in the episode ""Grace"", a witty and charming one. Brett is, as usual, a dashing and perfect performer. (people who wish to provide this unfairly underrated actor with a posthumous Bafta may go to facebook:""posthumous BAFTA for Jeremy Brett). But in fact, I enjoyed very much all the episodes. The stories are enthralling, deep, behind a light appearance. The actors are very good and their delivery is perfect. Moreover there are english subtitles, very helpful for people who can't hear...and for foreigners. I'm delighted with this series.",1273017600,15,600,5.13265306122449

3517080,5,B001CR49HK,"Five stars for American born (1843), turned British subject prior to death, author Henry James and his tales of romantic conquest in an English setting.  Stories are primarily Victorian era, as Henry James himself died in 1916.  He left behind many very interesting stories and in this DVD set, seven of them have been brought to life in a fun way.

Each of the episodes is based on a separate book.  Author James has a way of leaving the ending a surprise. Not always does boy get girl, or girl get boy, or all's-well-that-ends-well. You CAN expect the unexpected. That is the delight of this set.  Some are romantic tragedy, some comedy, some suspense, a full smorgasbord of high living played out with a wide range of accomplished British actors and actresses.

Episode 1: ""Catherine"" based on ""Washington Square""
Episode 2: ""Adela"" based on ""The Marriages""
Episode 3: ""Miss Tita"" based on ""The Aspern Papers""
Episode 4: ""Grace"" based on ""Covering End""
Episode 5: ""Milly"" based on The Wings of the Dove""
Episode 6: ""Flora"" based on ""Glasses""
Episode 7: ""Mary and Louisa"" based on ""The Tone of Time"" and ""The Real Thing""

If you don't know of Henry James and his writing, the included biography on the DVD set will help. After seeing this group of his stories, you'll be looking for more from his books.  With ""Affairs of the Heart"" you could enjoy him for a week, one DVD segment per day. More likely, however, you'll not be able to put 23 hours between watching each episode.

With Henry James having written over 50 published works, let us hope there will be an ""Affairs of the Heart Series Two"" in the future.",1223424000,55,1615,4.658450704225352
8288863,5,B001CR49HK,"I enjoyed each of the seven dramas that are part of this series.  Being less than an hour long, they're perfect for an evening break on a busy day.  In my opinion, the acting, costumes, and scenery are all done very well.  I think that someone can enjoy these ""classic tales of love and loss"" whether or not they're familiar with the Henry James fiction on which they're based.  When I received the package, I watched at least one each night until I had seen them all, and know I'll be watching all of the episodes again.  I'm glad I bought this series and plan to buy Series 2 of Affairs of the Heart soon.  Worth getting!",1485993600,,623,4.282051282051282

8288868,3,B001CR49HK,"While these are cleverly condensed tales in the main, well done for the British television style of their broadcast era, it's best to take a break between.  A couple are on the upbeat side, but the overall tone is downbeat.  I'm sure the realism is dear to some who will insist life often takes the downturns these exhibit. But who wants to pay to see that?  I did enjoy seeing many actors in younger days, the costumes and overall quality of the production.  But can't see doing a re-visit on any of them.  Would definitely recommend not viewing two or three in a row as the cumulative effect can be rather depressing.  The two with the artist are the best, which end the series on a good note if you watch them in order.  But, for me, they don't save the series.",1402790400,2,764,4.338028169014085

8288870,5,B001CR49HK,"Henry James brought to life by ITV
I am staggered that this (and the second series) is a Region 1 USA import, but I can only guess that Americans count Henry James as an AMERICAN writer, despite the fact that his literary career was almost exclusively based in London and Europe.
This series was devised by Terence Feely, and produced by ITV in 1974.
Other (Amazon USA) reviews list the sources of each of the seven story, by Henry James, concealed behind the episode-titles of women's names: e.g. ""Miss Tita"" for Episode 3 based on ""The Aspern Papers"", or ""Catherine"" for Episode 1, based on ""Washington Square"" (also filmed as ""The Heiress""), or ""Milly"" for Episode 5 based on ""The Wings of a Dove"", itself based on the life and tubercular death of Henry James' neice.
The production values are TV-only, not ""film"", being pre-""Brideshead"" or ""Jewel in the Crown"", or Jeremy Brett's incomparable ""Sherlock Holmes"". (Brett has a leading role in one of the stories!)
But as the chosen stories are mainly ""chamber music"", played indoors, the theatre-like sets are not a serious issue.
The costumes are fine.
The script is eloquent.
The casting is generally excellent, although when Gayle Hunnicut's beautiful face says she has ""excellent teeth"" (as part of the vain charms of the impoverished and tragically blighted beauty in Episode 6, ""Flora"", based on James' story ""Glasses"") this is unfortunate, as Hunnicutt has strikingly unusual dentures.
Her face, however, is ravishing, of course.
As a whole, the seven stories range across subtle drama, tragedy, light comedy, and even a light-handed farce, in the final story of two women who had each loved, and been jilted by, a roguish Italian musician.
The dialogue occasionally sounds like Jane Austen's writing: very, very proper, and refined, and alusive.
At other times (as in ""Milly"") it has the coyness of E.M. Forster. Is the secretly engaged but impoverished bachelor really meant to marry, or just to physically satisfy, the wealthy young orphaned girl who is dying? The negotiations over this are subtle and at times quite suggestive, especially as the man's price for agreeing to woo the girl is that his fiancee should first submit to him, physically (undressed bodies seen for about a second!).
Overall, this is an excellent way to enjoy Henry James, in a wide range of moods, and also enjoy a fine collection of actors, including Diana Rigg as a highly amusing American adventuress manipulating relationships and real estate. (George Cole is the unscrupulous pater and real estate scoundrel -- eerily anticipating his role in ""The Minder"").
Patricia Routledge (best known for her role as Hyacinth Bucket -- ""boo-quay"" -- in ""Keeping Up Appearances"") is seen as a younger and pretty old-maiden aunt in the otherwise tragic version of ""Glasses"".
Highly recommended!

8288871,2,B001CR49HK,"We enjoy and have purchased many of the British series from Masterpiece Theater and PBS.
What we didn't know and it does not seem clear in the summaries, is that almost all the situations take place in the parlors, libraries or drawing rooms of homes.
This makes the situations quite stuffy and many times, boring. There is little to no interaction outside in the beautiful countryside or hussle and bussle of the cities.
The dialogue isn't stimulating enough to carry the confined space.",1337990400,4,488,4.891566265060241

My husband has read the Henry James stories on which these episodes were based and said that they closely followed James's storyline. Of course, we liked some episodes better than others, not because of inferior acting, but just because of the story line. We especially liked the Patricia Routledge episode as she is one of our favorite British actresses. Had we not enjoyed Series I, we would not purchase Season II.",1337558400,4,577,4.78
