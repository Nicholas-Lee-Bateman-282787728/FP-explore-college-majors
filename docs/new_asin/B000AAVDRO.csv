Language is not for the feint of heart but if you like raw comedy and accept he's an equal opportunity offender, you'll rofl. I've watched his DVD's over and over and always laugh my socks off. DVD was NIB and no marks/scratches. Took awhile to get here from the UK but that's more of a customs and USPS issue.",1526083200,,407,4.368421052631579
8077464,5,B000AAVDRO,"The only problem was I did not know what a ""region"" meant and could not play it.  You cannot ask a question about something that does not mean anything to you.

However, I broke down and got the machine that plays it for $60.00 and considered it like a concert ticket.

And if you have a warped sense of humor (or none as my wife says) or if you still call a handicapped parking space a ""cripple spot"", you will love this guy.",1499731200,,426,4.108433734939759
