7674696,5,B01CDT60CC,Steven Seagal is my favorite actor. Lots of action!,1462492800,2,51,4.777777777777778
7674697,2,B01CDT60CC,"If a man does his best, what else is there? Vic Mosby (Abell) is a Sergeant in charge of leading a mission to extract an American Congressman from an Afghan village. When things go south and one of the men is injured, sniper Jake Chandler (Seagal)  stays behind to watch him. Now with two men stuck behind enemy lines and a commander unwilling to risk further harm Sergeant Mosby must decide to follow orders, or to rescue member of his team. This movie has everything you expect from a Steven Seagal movie: sub-par acting, generic action sequences and scenes that make you laugh and wonder how that is even possible. The one thing it is missing is Steven Seagal. Normally that isn't a bad thing, but when he is billed as the main actor you expect more than 5 minutes of screen time. I think he has finally reached the point where he cant do this anymore. His scenes involve him laying, sitting and being shot from the waist up. It seems like he is physically unable to move anymore. Maybe this is what he should expect if he makes anymore movies. Overall, generic and exactly what you would expect from a movie like this. I give this a C-.",1462060800,7,1140,4.428571428571429

7674699,1,B01CDT60CC,"Jake (Steven ""Bradley Cooper is a sissy"" Seagal) is a sniper who is part of group who is tasked to rescue an anti-war congressman (John Henry Richardson) from the Taliban. Rescue of congressman- good, his security team- not so good. The group gets separated. Jake is left behind with an injured man and some dead soldiers as another group lead by Vic (Tim Abell) gets away. The story divides into a plot and subplot. The plot consists back inside the fence Vic trying to avoid a jinx NATO reporter (Charlene Amoia) who is also the admiral's niece. Seagal is the subplot who basically sits and looks out a window, occasionally reading a line in monotone.

This is the part of the army that doesn't have to wear helmets in a war zone and can disregard regulations on grooming. Tim Abell is the star of the film, as Seagal had a smaller role, if not minor as compared to the overall plot. The dialogue consisted of cliche lines when good. The plot flew by the seat of its pants, with much of the film being consumed with bad dialogue attempting to make a believable tale. Okay, I lied, at no time did they attempt to make this a believable tale. The ending was unorthodox and idiotic to say the least. And the ""Van Dam"" in the film is Pro Wrestle Rob Van Dam, who can't deliver a line outside of the ring.

It was one of those films so awful you sit with your mouth open watching it.  Who gave Fred Olen Ray permission to write a serious film?  May have camp value.

7674721,1,B01CDT60CC,"As far as I can tell, there are two types of people in the world: people who'll watch any film with an explosion on the cover, and people who don't understand how Steven Seagal is still in films.

If you're the first type of person, I don't think you'll see this review, because you can't read. If you're the second type, this movie is more of Steven Seagal playing Steven Seagal as he imagines himself, and it's almost funny to watch. Almost.

Probably save yourself the run time and just have a nap instead.",1533254400,,509,4.404255319148936

7674723,1,B01CDT60CC,"Holy cow. This may not be the worst film I've ever seen, but it's up there on a top 5 for sure. I can't believe I made it all the way through this clunker. For starters Steven Seagal has a minor role... And it's a painfully bad one... Also not much sniper action going on either. The pacing was horrible. I felt like the majority of the film was characters talking about what they were going to do, rather than doing it. 90 percent redundant and unnecessary scenes. Eye-rollingly dislikable characters too. The cherry on top of this turd was the ending where there is this brutally forced ""heartfelt"" camaraderie scene. Like, we've been on some journey together, and now we can feel the unspoken ""brotherhood"" between the soldiers. There was no journey. This was barley a movie, I can't believe there was a budget for this. I can only assume this was made by people who couldn't care less about filmmaking, or made as a big middle finger to the industry. In short...  It sucked yo.",1532131200,,981,4.5423728813559325

7674725,1,B01CDT60CC,"Please do NOT watch this movie. OMG My IQ went straight to zero. Seagal was a great low end actor in the 80's and into the 90's but only due to the karate and the low end hot actresses.
Seriously this movie is horrible I wish I could give a full review but I did not watch the whole movie, I watched it for apprx 10 minutes total on two different occassions, nothing I saw made me believe any actor/actress in this movie has ever had any military and/or combat training. In most movies the people in charge have someone; a choreographer to help with the movements and even hire REAL military and or law enforcement officers to help with the realism, not this one.
Really????? Rob Van Dam!!!! bahahaha. I only started watching this movie for the where are they now aspect of a washed up wrestler.

7674752,1,B01CDT60CC,"If I could rate a 1/2 star that would have been too much for this sad waste of a DVD - luckily I could watch it free under Prime.  Seagal is sadly over weight and as such he sits all thru the move and just grumbles out his lines trying to sound mean and impressive. Mean while the guy who he saved is sitting up behind him, not able to feel his legs, supposedly due to a spinal injury (per Seagal) - so in all his infinite wisdom he has this guy sitting up and not laying down.  As for the rest of the cast, talk about OVER ACTING.

This movie is BAD. There is a TINY bit of long distance shooting at the beginning. Literally no actual sniping in this movie. The main guy with the beard and cap was believable but this movies plot was terrible, no budget, etc.

 This one is just bad. There's lots of shooting and some explosions that break the horribly implausible storyline of some sort of a ragtag band of special ops types who go into some remote Afghanistan Village to save a congressman and then somehow end up with a local Taliban leaders daughter-in-law in tow.

There's also female reporter who just tagged along for the heck of it. Once the shooting stars so she picks up a gun and starts shooting. Turns out she can shoot better than these special ops guys with a pistol and they have rifles.

 If you can get past the implausible storyline and just enjoy the shooting you might get something out of this but really it's just bad.",1500076800,,821,4.410596026490066

No trademark hand-to-hand combat either, which makes one wonder why Seagal even bothered with ""appearing"" in this dud. With no action, few lines, and minimal interaction with other actors, one wonders why the paunchy senior citizen even bothered. Was Danny Trejo not available to play a 70 year-old combat soldier? He did, however, use a stunt double (twice!) when he walked up the stairs. In his portly condition, that may have been an insurance requirement on the set...",1497916800,,602,5.03

Could have emptied the load from one truck to the other and been out of the 'hot zone' within 5 minutes. Nothing but empty reality.

7674775,3,B01CDT60CC,Not quite what I expected,1491696000,,25,4.2
7674776,1,B01CDT60CC,"There's only one reason to watch this movie - Tim Abell. He's outstanding. Van Dam? First it's not Jean Claude - it's wrestler Rob Van Dam and he's HORRIBLE. He has no military background and only to find out he trained ONE DAY at a firing range for the role and it shows. I'd forgive his lack of acting skills if he had looked like he knew how to handle a weapon. Now that horrible performance is forever. Seagal - Well, if you don't mind him doing most of a scenes from a chair, then he gives the stereotypical performance. Seems he's too big(not ego, or stardom wise) to do any scenes almost any other way. This isn't anything new.

Tim Abell knows his way around a set and a military movie. He's the real deal having been an army ranger and it shows on screen. Great scene between him and Dale Dye. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 2 stars just because of Abell and Dye's performance. Rent don't buy.

Fred Olin Ray, congrats, you made another turd. But I will say this is the best looking film he's done in years. I'm quite honestly floored he even knew people who could make digital look like a film. Now I want to change my rating back to a 1, but again, Abell and Dye are worth the extra star. Crap, can't do it. 1 star. 1.5 would be more honest.",1489795200,,1259,4.155737704918033

7674792,1,B01CDT60CC,"If there's one talent that Seagal has (and it isn't acting), it's the ability to get fans' juices flowing when he stares down some punk and then kicks his ass. You won't get any of that here. They put Seagal in at the beginning and end of the movie doing some ""sniping"" (which, conveniently, doesn't require him to stand up); for the entire middle of the movie, he stays behind to guard an injured soldier and just sits in a chair. As the story unfolds -- involving other actors off on an adventure but not involving Seagal -- the film occasionally cuts back to the room where he's sitting in a chair and the injured guy is sitting against the wall. The injured guy says inane things like, ""I can't feel my legs,"" to which Seagal (barely) responds with something like, ""We just gonna have to wait for help"" or ""I gotta go get some water."" His scenes, which were no doubt shot all at once in about 10 minutes, serve only one purpose: to convince his most stupid fans that Seagal is actually in the story. He's not. The entire story line takes place without him. When we do see him sitting in the chair, we might wonder if they have him strapped in to prevent him from toppling over. My first thought was that maybe the man is ill and unable to stand or walk and this was the only way they could bang out another movie to keep the revenue flowing. Currently, you can catch this clunker for free on Netflix. Even for free, it's barely worth it. And to the extent that you might find entertainment value in it, that will not be because of anything you see Seagal do. Unless you find watching a fat man perched in a chair entertaining.",1486080000,,1630,4.330065359477124
7674793,2,B01CDT60CC,"The opening sequence and ensuing firefight will have you either laughing hysterically or it'll cause you to hit ""Stop"" and walk away. Seriously, reruns of TJ Hooker are more authentic than this movie when it comes to weapons and tactics. The opening scene begins with Seagal (of course) behind a ""sniper"" rifle. Amazingly, this rifle is suppressed without being suppressed -- must be those new, top secret DARPA rounds. He and his spotter -- complete with $20 Walmart binos for spotting -- provide overwatch for his team of Operators on the ground. While you're obviously supposed to believe that his team is a group of pipe-hitting Tier-1 dudes from Planet Black Ops, they apparently forgot every last drop of weapons and tactics training they had since Day One at Boot. Even the Master Sensei himself can't figure out how to handle a carbine as he demonstrates his god-like level of ""spray-and-pray"" skill -- which is OK, because he apparently has a 9,000 round mag.

Things go from bad to worse to you asking ""Who paid real dollars to actually make this movie?!"" The first clue to the caliber of this ""production"" is the ""Seagal - Van Dam"" headliners on the DVD cover -- only it's NOT Jean Claude, it's some no-relation dude named ROB! No... I kid you not! Once I shifted expectations from ""Hey, it's another Seagal B-action movie"" to ""This is comedic gold!"" it went from being a one-star review to the coveted two-star dynamo! The dialog, the acting, the Dollar Store ""Operatorness"" of it all add up to become what just has to be Seagal's greatest train wreck of a flick -- and that's saying something! In reality, that's what makes this movie endurable, the sheer visual and audible trauma from beginning to end. It's like watching a zit pop. It's nasty, but you just can't look away.",1485561600,,1789,4.752411575562701
7674794,1,B01CDT60CC,Absolutely terrible movie! For starters the action is completely unrealistic. Yet another action movie with seemingly bottomless magazines as there are very few reloads in the movie. It says special ops but these guys have struggle even reloading or hitting a Target the reporter is apparently more of an operator then any of the guys because she could shoot targets with the pistol that the Special Operations guys are missing 30 and 40 rounds with their rifles. Clearly whoever wrote this doesn't know anything about Middle East culture either. I would not recommend this to anybody.

Like when Seagal is shooting, the sound is of a suppressed firearm, when he clearly has a muzzle brake. Or guys reloading in the middle of a street when having contact. Did they walk through an Army Surplus store next to a Big5 to load up on their gear and dress? Bypassed the makeup artist (and barber) on the way to the set?

One scene Rob was standing behind a empty 55 gal drum and 7.62 rounds were bouncing off the drum. The talaban were wearing a mixture of operator pants and camouflage and I think I saw the Same 3 guys get killed about 47 times they didn't even bother to change his shemag. It was so bad I just had to keep watching because I was waiting for one realistic thing to happen.
It never did. And the most annoying actor in the movie was the no talent woman reporter. If I had paid for this I would take it back to the store and get my money back. As it is its 2 hours of my life I can't get back. I hope this review helps you save that 2 hours. Next time I will just go do my laundry like my wife asked me too it would be more fun.

7675006,3,B01CDT60CC,"SNIPER: SPECIAL OPS stars Steven Seagal as, get this, a sniper attached to a Special Ops unit. Who knew? It's also the fourth film in what renegade film critic Vern has affectionately dubbed his ""Goatee Era."" The basic plot is that a Special Ops unit is performing a rescue mission in Afghanistan when things go south and turn into a firefight. Seagal and another soldier are left behind, and the remainder of the team gets sent on a side mission after returning to base, hoping to eventually go back and retrieve Seagal and the other guy, who are still waiting in place. I thought that the story was ok, but nothing special. As is typical with Seagal films, there is some stuff thrown about that makes it a little bit topical, and there was an authentic feel to the dialogue, costumes, and the way the actors carried themselves. All this was fine, and the performances were generally serviceable, if unremarkable. The major problem is the serious lack of Seagal himself. Although he is top-billed and appears on the poster, he really doesn't do all that much. Some other actor could have played his part and no difference would have been made. As for the action, it's mostly just a bunch of shootouts and firefights, and a couple of stock explosions towards the end. There were also a number of interesting throwaway lines and asides that made the characters a little more colorful than they were probably written. Overall, I found this seriously lacking as a Seagal film, but for what it's worth, SNIPER: SPECIAL OPS is a decent low-budget actioner that doesn't insult your intelligence too much.
