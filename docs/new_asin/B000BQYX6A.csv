8091184,5,B000BQYX6A,After watching this workout to see how it would be it looks very doable and something I would keep at doing over a long period of time. 20 minutes of low impact aerobics and 15 minutes of strengthening. Nothing to hard or to much twisting for someone with an SI joint problem.,1404777600,,276,4.326923076923077
8091185,2,B000BQYX6A,Not a very good workout.  Very weak.  I would recommend another video.  Does not work up much of a sweat.,1355788800,,105,4.15
8091186,5,B000BQYX6A,"I really liked it! I just had a baby and its is just enough time to workout while he is sleeping. I love the walking and then the pilates, I feel like I worked everything out. Its the perfect amount of cardio and its easy enough the my 2year old likes to walk in place with me too! The pilates is helping me find those stomach muscles that I lost with my pregnancies.",1264809600,,367,4.041095890410959
8091187,4,B000BQYX6A,"This is a good workout for beginners. I am in relatively good shape, fairly active and lead a healthy lifestyle. After doing this workout for a couple weeks I am finding it to be not quite the challenge that I need. It was great in the beginning to get started (I've never done workout videos before) but now I need a little more intensity in my workout. But it would be great for beginners or those really out of shape. The steps are easy, and explained very thoroughly. PJ is a little annoying, but does grow on you. I also felt the walking part could be a bit longer.  I would definitely go back to this though, to put some variety in my workout and when I just want to do a quick, 45 min routine.  I do plan on trying volume 2, which I think will pump up the intensity a bit.",1227312000,2,779,4.084967320261438
8091188,5,B000BQYX6A,"I enjoy Stott pilates series of dvds. They are very effective and Merrithew is very good at describing the proper form. After performing, I feel relexed, yet strengthened.",1226880000,,171,5.142857142857143
8091189,5,B000BQYX6A,"I really enjoyed walking with PJ - she is friendly and encouraging, a much more subdued Leslie Sansone.  I also enjoyed the quieter classical piano background music for a change of pace from L*O*U*D workout music; don't get me wrong, I do need L*O*U*D sometimes to get me going, but this is a very nice change of pace for when I just want ... less.  The walkout/workout consists of roughly 20 minutes of walking cardio, with the usual wide steps, some heel digs, some kicks, etc.  While the participants put their hands on their hips quite a bit, you can certainly make it more intense by adding your own arm movements (arms overhead and pulled down, arms stretched in front of you and pulled back, etc.)  After the walk (which I wish had been just a wee bit longer), there is a roughly 15-minute Pilates routine.  Overall, I found this to be just a pleasant walk with some nice Pilates stretching afterward.  Very nice!",1170201600,6,920,4.579268292682927
8091190,4,B000BQYX6A,"I started walking about 6 weeks ago and picked up this DVD from my local library.  I love doing the walking workout with this DVD first thing in the morning before I get ready for work. It only takes about 20 minutes if you cut out the warm-up and cool-down segments since the workout is not that intense. By the end of my 20 minutes, I have worked up a good sweat and am ready to start my day.

I tried the toning part of the DVD this morning and found it OK, but I enjoy the walking part much more.  The toning part of the DVD was a little difficult for me.

However, I enjoyed the walking segment so much that I purchased the DVD so I can continue this workout when I can't or don't feel like walking for an hour outside. I also don't have a treadmill or gym membership. So I either go for an hour of walking outdoors or pop in this DVD.

I started out at 196 pounds.  I'm a mother of two, 35 years old and am 5'6"" tall. After just six weeks of walking and eating a low-fat and smaller portions diet, I am now down to 180 pounds and very motivated to continue my weight loss. My goal is 150 pounds.

You can do it too!!!",1151020800,13,1123,3.9644444444444447
8091191,2,B000BQYX6A,"This video's only redeeming quality is its excellent pilates instruction.  Like all Stott videos this one takes extra care to explain proper form and technique.  Unfortunately, the aerobics portion is extremely boring and simple.  You just walk in place the whole time with no interesting variations.

If you are looking for a video for a beginner, this one might work for you if you are truly new to exercise and are REALLY out of shape.  Although I consider myself a beginner when it comes to exercise, this video was too easy for me.  I haven't exercised consistently in several years.  However, I do have a moderately active lifestyle.  I walk and hike on occassion and I play with my kids at the park--that sort of thing.  If you have trouble with everyday activities because you are out of shape, this would be a great place to start.  If you are somewhat fit, this video might be too easy for you as well.

You might also like this video if you feel like you have no coordination.  There are no fancy moves at all.  If you can walk, you can do this video.  I like simple steps, but this was too simple.

In general, though, I think you'd be better off saving your money and taking a walk.  Spend your money on one of the other excellent Stott videos that focuses exclusively on pilates.",1142208000,14,1293,4.484978540772532
