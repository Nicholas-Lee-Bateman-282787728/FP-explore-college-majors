22300,3,0767839277,"Is Elmo irritating? Heck yes. I wish he could use the pronoun ""I."" BUT he's a cuddly cute friend to a lot of toddlers out there, mine included. We don't watch Sesame Street at home, but my son must get enough Elmo from the daycare, because he knew who this movie was about when we borrowed it from the library.
The message viewers are supposed to get is about sharing - after not wanting to share his beloved blanket with his friend Zoe, Elmo loses said blanket down Oscar's trashcan and subsequently into Grouchland, where it is claimed by the colorful villian Huxley, who never shares anything.
So our little ones should be learning how to share...unfortunately, one of the more memorable songs is sung by Mandy Patinkin (Huxley) called ""MINE."" My little boy had never grabbed anything and yelled ""Mine!"" until he watched this video. He understood about Elmo's blanket, because he has one of his own that's special, but it seems he got the wrong message!
The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag of images; Vanessa Williams is stunning as the Queen of Trash, but her appearance is like a short cameo. There's a giant chicken that seems loosely related to Huxley. A conveniently placed talking vegetable. This is not the caliber of education and entertainment I've come to expect from the Children's Television Workshop, or from Henson Productions. I wouldn't recommend the video for children under 3, even if they're Elmo fans (my son was 26 months when we had the ""MINE!"" problem.)
Hooray for Ernie and Bert, though, our time-tested film narrators!",985564800,8,1550,4.765799256505576
22301,5,0767839277,"This was a great movie for small children. It is also enjoyable for adults also. I found it to be very cute and entertaining! It is about Elmo, and  how he gets in a fight with his friend over sharing his blanket. Well, alot  of things go wrong and Elmo's blanket ends up at Grouch's trashcan. The  Grouch throws the blanket down the garbage can and Elmo dives in after it,  only to realize that it has been spirited to a place called Grouchland.  What he dosen't know is that Grouchland is being ruled over by a guy named  Huxley who has a problem with sharing things, and he has been stealing from  the townsfolk, always telling them, ""If I touch it...it's MINE!""  Elmo has to figure out how to get his blanket back, with the help of many  colorful characters. The whole movie is great for small children. It  teaches them the value of friendship and sharing, which is something they  need to know about at a young age. The movie also allows the children to  participate in certain scenes (ex. singing along, helping Elmo to blow  raspberries, helping Elmo find his way through a dark cave). Overall, this  is a great movie for children, and I really did enjoy it, which is why I  have to recommend it!",965865600,6,1204,4.409090909090909
22302,1,0767839277,"Explain to me, please, what the Henson Creature Factory was thinking. Explain to me, even more, what Mandy Patinkin was thinking. (Vanessa Williams barely rates a mention, and here it is, now forget she exists.)
  It's become obvious down through the years that, as cartoons list  their stylish subtlety and went increasingly towards a specific aim at the  juvenile crowd, that Jim Henson and his band of merry monsters would take  up the slack that the golden age of Warner Brothers and Looney Toons had  left-- material that was aimed at kids, but with enough adult-oriented  material to keep the adults watching, as well. (Go back and watch those old  cartoons. You'll be amazed at what passed you over when you were a tot that  you find hilarious now, such as Porky Pig's many jabs at Hitler.) Henson's  bunch created two of television's finest, and most underrated, variety  shows, The Muppet Show and Muppets Tonight, both of which played the  balance between kid-oriented slapstick and more adult humor that could have  come straight from the joke book of Don Rickles. And when they started  making movies, they opted for the same approach, and when parents went to  see The Muppet Movie with the little ones, they ended up laughing just as  much.
  When Jim Henson died, Brian took over, and the Creature Factory  was born. Muppets in Space proved that the son had capably stepped into the  shoes of the father. And now... we get this sickly, stupid, ungainly,  ludicrous mess that can only be called a film because somewhere someone is  burning miles of celluloid with these images on it. At least, I fervently  hope so. Even the kids in the audience (all four of them) were relatively  bored with this pathetic attempt at making a kid-friendly version of The  Rocky Horror Picture Show (with audience participation and all). We're long  past the point where we feel we need to overly simplify moral lessons for  kids, aren't we? Yet the ""learning"" imparted in this film  sounds-- and smells-- like a dead haddock hitting you in the face.
  If  your kid is the world's biggest Elmo fanatic, wait until the video comes  out, and then tape it off PBS. But my kid is probably #2, and at least  twice she asked ""is it time to go home yet?"" (This is a kid who  sat through A Bug's Life and The Wizard of Oz with no problems, mind you.)  Does it rate any stars at all? You be the judge....",961286400,4,2392,4.627684964200477
22303,4,0767839277,"This is a fun film to watch even if you aren't wearing diapers while you do.  I bought this for my daughter and if it were VHS it would have been eaten by the VCR by now because it has been played so much.
Kids love  Elmo, and rightfully so.  Elmo is pretty cool, especially if you are under  5 years old.  However, adults can enjoy this film too.  The Sesame Street  characters are in their best form, and there are enough subtle adult jokes  to keep you giggling.
The only reason I don't give Elmo 5 stars is that  the film is in Pan And Scan and is not available widescreen.  My daughter  watches Muppets from Space and Stuart Little widescreen, so I am not sure  why Elmo isn't.",956880000,,682,4.161538461538462
22304,5,0767839277,"Yes, Mr. Anonymous reviewer below me, your four year old may have been too old for this movie.
On the other hand, my two year old is just nuts about this flick.  I never want to make the TV a substitute father, but this is  one movie my son can watch over and over again and never get bored.
It's  so wonderful to see him actually sit still for a while and cheer for the  good guys- and this gentle movie's message of sharing is so beautiful, not  only don't I mind it when he wants to watch this video again, I encourage  it.
And who couldn't love Elmo.
I enthusiastically reccomend this movie  for all children three and under.",956016000,,629,4.191666666666666
22305,5,0767839277,"I am amazed at the top notch quality of this production!  The music is fantastic!  The best feature of this movie is that, unlike several popular Disney movies, it addresses the fact that toddlers have a hard time  understanding that what they see on TV is not always real and that they can  get very scared.  This movie handles it so cleverly!  Whenever something  happens that might be upsetting to younger viewers, Bert and Ernie come on  the screen to explain that everything will be OK.  It's the best children's  movie I have ever seen!  My 3 year old daughter stays captivated for the  entire film.",953251200,,605,4.60377358490566

It was cute & entertaining for me; but she loved it.  Burt & Ernie  kept the concept of falling into Grouchland from being too scary, and the  tunes were engaging.  I highly recommend for all pre-schoolers!",945820800,24,349,4.375
22308,5,0767839277,"I highly recomend this movie for anyone with young children.  I took both my son (2 1/2) and daughter (1 1/2) to see this in the theater.  I was very nervous because this was our first theater experience.  Not only did my son  sit still for the whole movie, he was talking about it for days afterward.  My daughter didn't quite make it through the whole thing, but I didn't  really expect her to.  It was very easy to follow, my son was telling the  story to his grandparents, aunt, and anyone who would listen.  Very good  movie.",944179200,13,530,4.316326530612245
22309,5,0767839277,I am the mother of an 18-month-old daughter who is an absolute Elmo nut!  We saw this movie in the theater and it was the first time she has sat still for more than five minutes since she was a very small baby.  She  hardly even blinked during the entire 73 minutes of the movie.  Excellent  movie and I would recommend it to all parents of children who love Elmo.,943574400,44,364,4.142857142857143

I enjoyed the creation of Grouchland that it could be this amazing place that wasn't necessarily made up or imagination. (because Elmo is always imaginging places). The grouches were not scary at all and they made it a whimsical adventure.
Was I the only adult who didn't realize that the actor Mandy Patinkin was the guy who played Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride?! Blew my mind. He was a fun bad guy. I did enjoy the movie showing strong emotions that kids do occasionally feel. Not wanting to share. Disappointment. Loss. It dealt with those in an age appropriate way without just skimming over it expecting kids to always be happy and go-lucky. As usual the Sesame Street universe doesnt disappoint. Highly recommended for any kiddo interested in Elmo.",1459209600,2,896,4.787096774193548

I've had some problems in the past year with nightmares; the scene where Elmo and Zoe are fighting over the blanket will play over and over until I wake up in a cold sweat.  I was actually institutionalized for a month because I started believing that I was Elmo.  I've grown from my experience, and now know that I am in fact, not Elmo.  You and your children will enjoy this classic Hensen film, without a doubt.  However, please don't fall into the same trap as I did.

In the few minutes of this movie:

1. Elmo loses his lovey-blanket [in a long traumatic scene where no less than 6 disasters happen to poor blankie]
2. then has to go down Oscar's trash can [graphics so frightening of this ""going down"" that they had to interrupt it with narrative]
3. then lands into scary grouch land [angry yelling everywhere] only to
4. have an evil villain (yes! They call him an EVIL villain!!) land in some spaceship contraption and make a huge fuss over stealing his blankie and taking it away to his evil hideout...

After that I don't know what happens because my 3.5-year-old [who loves Elmo and begged for this movie] was hiding under the pillows screaming ""Mommy, stop it! Turn it off!""  What were you thinking Sesame Street writers!?",1454889600,,830,4.783216783216783

Most of the time I can distract her with some other activity so I do not have to watch/hear Elmo. However, one evening she was particularly insistent that I find some form of Elmo for her. Tired of the usual 2-3 minute youtube clips, I decided to search for Elmo on Amazon Prime Video and I found this.

While I really am not a fan of Elmo (obviously) there were good lengthy portions of this movie that did not include Elmo but instead showcased some of my other favorite Sesame Street characters like Grover (who turns into super grover in this movie), Oscar and even Telly monster. You know, characters from before they started to introduce the new muppets with annoying voices.

She enjoyed watching this, though we will not be watching it again. The reason being, I do not want her to start insisting that we watch it again and again until I'd rather stab myself in the ears.",1453507200,,1004,4.39247311827957

My 3 year old who is usually not disturbed by things very easily was very frightened by the villain who came and stole Elmo's ""blanket/lovey"" in a pretty aggressive way. My son was physically shaking and started to cry.  He now doesn't want to watch Sesame Street at all; not even the regular show.
After he calmed down, I tried to get him to watch again a little later in the film so he could get some resolution.  That was also a mistake because the comments were that if Elmo went to get his blanket he ""may never come home again"".
If you have a child under the age of 3 who is not cognitively aware of things or maybe over the age of 4 or 5 and rationally understands what is happening and isn't attached to their Lovey/blanket/transitional object your child may enjoy this film.

But even as a single older woman with just a cat I found this movie a delight to watch.  Mandy Patnik is the perfect villain for Elmo and it is obvious that he is having a great time with his role.  The movie also had enough of the old elements (Big Bird, Grover, Bert and Erine, etc.) for adults to travel down memory lane as well as the new characters of the current generation.  The songs were like Disney songs a hit for any age to enjoy.  The movie also like any great family movie blends fun children cuteness with jokes for the adults.  So whatever you age take indulge your inner child with this fun movie.  This is one movie I am keeping on my list.

The seductive song,""Gender Free Point of View,"" gives kids something to imagine all right-- hermaphrodites.  What a bunch of bogus to spoon feed to children.  Save your nonsense for other things, Sesame Street, and tune into reality.  Teaching children gender is a ""point of view"" is not only a lie but a sinister way of destroying identity. Saying gender is a point of view is like saying the color of a zebra's stripes depend on your point of view.  Utterly ridiculous!",1433289600,,604,4.892156862745098

When things get tense, Bert and Ernie stop the proceedings and Ernie manages to tell Bert that everything will be fine. My wife and I really liked this device which allowed them to tackle a more difficult villain than they other wise might have. So, cudos for that. Performances are good,  Mandy Patinkin is wonderfully over the top as Huxley.

I knocked off a star because the ""Bad Guy"" was too scary  for Evan.  I'm not sure if it was the odd eyebrow extensions or the helicopter that he arrived in when we first see him.  Mandy did a good job in acting the part and even singing.  The songs were a little too long but funny and cute to watch.  Evan just wanted me to fast forward the ""Bad Guy.""  I didn't tell Evan that Huxley was bad.  She assumed he was because everyone in Grouchland was afraid of him.

Venessa Williams was good and Evan liked her a little.  My granddaughter also liked how Elmo wanted his blanket and then decides to share the blanket with Zoe.  She was also insistent that Elmo's friends help him.  Elmo's songs were fun to watch.

It's difficult to watch this on my kindle HD because I had to try to fast forward the ""scary"" parts.  We still were able to get the gist of the plot.  I wasn't able to get it to play at the part where Elmo got the blanket from Huxley.  But we did see and like how Elmo and the people of Sesame Street celebrated that Elmo got the blanket back.

We'll wait a few more months and then maybe Huxley won't be such a ""Bad Guy.""",1365811200,,1313,4.163346613545817

Unfortunately I am trying to get him to watch other videos instead because this doesn't teach the greatest lessons.
First of all, you have Huxley (Mandy Patinkin)who yells alot and specifically yells MINE alot. All well and good if your child is old enough to understand that's not nice but for younger children, they just pick up the MINE since it is emphasized in the yelling. Young kids WILL pick this up. There is even a ""mine"" song that we skip everytime we watch the video.
Second, there are a few questionable things that Huxley says, calling Elmo names and taunting him.  At one point, he calls Elmo a little red bathmat only it doesn't really sound like bathmat.
The rest of the movie is okay, minus Huxley, I don't know if they picked the wrong actor or just wrote his character poorly but either way it's really too bad.  I find the rest of the songs catchy and am okay watching the movie over and over, skipping over some of the Huxley parts of course
As a note: the chicken at the end may be a little scary since it tries to eat Elmo but my son wasn't afraid and he's usually pretty sensitive to that kind of stuff.
In terms of Elmo movies, Cinderelmo is a little more mellow and less nasty and I like Kathy Najimy far better as the main human character. Premise is still pretty silly but at least I don't have to fast forward through any parts.",1291593600,,1534,4.2827586206896555

The songs are dancable (if that is a word) the plot has a lesson (it's important to share) there are several sub-plots sprinkled through out the movie (i.e., patience is important, accidents happen, etc) and more than that...Elmo is adorable.

Yes, he goes through some scary moments but they are all tackled or explained (Ernie and Bert pop in and out) and he comes out wiser and stronger for them.

My grandson watches it nightly... he loves it and so do I.  Especially the scene about the Queen of Trash... she sings a great song ""It's all about your point of view""...I actaully used it as the basis for a message I preached at church.

There is one thing that stands out as being kind of wonky, though: Elmo happens upon Zoe, who is crying because her father had to work and couldn't take her out. Elmo consoles her by allowing her to hold his precious blanket and when he decides he'd like it back, she replies, ""In a minute, Elmo."" So Elmo says, ""Elmo wants his blanket back now."" The ensuing tug of war ends up with a rip in the blanket which then gets lost in a series of unfortunate events. The problem here is that when Elmo asked for his blanket back, Zoe should have given it to him and thanked him rather than insisting on holding it to the point where he had to forcibly try to reclaim it. Now the blanket also wouldn't have ripped if Zoe hadn't been fighting to hold onto an item that wasn't hers and which had been requested returned by the owner. I think the story goes on to teach kids to not be selfish and greedy like Huxley, and at one point the Queen of Trash compares Elmo to Huxley because Elmo wanted his own blanket back. There's a difference between Huxley, who took anything and everything and made it his, and Elmo who rightfully owned his blanket. Kids shouldn't be forced to share. Kids should not be taught that anyone OWES them their stuff, that when they borrow something they can refuse to return it and so on.

24966,4,0767839277,"My daughter is 22 months old and LOVES Elmo and LOVES this movie. She is a very sensitive child, but she is not at all bothered by the ""scary"" situations and ""scary"" characters as stated by other reviewers. This movie is not dark, does not teach bad morals, and does not teach disgusting behaviors. Grouchland is exactly what one would expect, but it is made pretty clear in the movie that it is just a different place and the other characters poke fun at it a bit, but accept grouchland for waht it is: a different country with a very different culture and customs. That is a pretty good messege.

As for the ""bad guy"" he is dressed like a clown and he commands a posse of bugs. The worst thing he does is act like a 2 year old having a tantrum and takes things. At no point is Elmo in mortal peril.

My daughter L-O-V-E-S this movie and it does not make her cry and she never even shows the slightest hint of fear that something might ""happen"" to Elmo. She is normally a very sensitive child and this movie has no ill effect on her.

Anyway I give this 4 out of 5 stars because the music is awful. All of the songs pretty much sound the same to me. Also, the movie really doesn't make a ton of sense, but it's for toddlers so what do you expect I guess? Ok and I also guess I did not like the part with Vannessa Williams (?) at all, it is a kids movie, she could have been wearing more ""costume"".",1243987200,3,1398,4.113553113553113

I may be uptight, but those are things that I want to try avoid exposing my daughter to when she is just starting to talk.  It was cute, though, and the music was catchy.  The style of shooting is also very different if you are used to watching other Sesame Street videos, obviously because it is an acutal movie. Maybe it's one of those things that has to grow on you.

Mandy Patinkin, who also stars in A Princess Bride as the person looking for the six-fingered man, does a wonderful job playing the mean-old Huxley. I love the eyebrows! As the bugs suggest, he might want to take a weed wacker to them.

I like the fact that it's a contiguous story, like ""Follow that Bird"" - unlike Elmo's ""Peter and the Wolf"" movie, which is not bad but it switches between an audience listening to the orchestra and the Peter and the Wolf story. ""Elmo in Grouchland"" is very entertaining and has slightly scary bits and good sound effects too.

Many have complained about the bad messages this movie gives to young children (stealing toys, hurting feelings, spitting, etc) and it is true, there is stealing and hurt feelings. But unlike many movies that are geared toward children, Elmo in Grouchland does not have any portrayals of violence, sexual innuendos, or cheap-taste thrills. The audience is given the opportunity to see the natural consequences of stealing, not being a good friend, etc.

In fact, the main plot of the story is that Elmo learns the value of friendship and to share his blankey-- a message that is very clear throughout the movie.

The songs give messages of not giving up (""Take the First Step""), the value of friendship (""Elmo's Best Friend/ Together Forever""), and songs about seeing different points of view.

If you can handle listening to these songs once every week or two (or more for kids who watch TV more), then this is a very good CD.

The joy of Sesame St. is that they include more than enough to keep things interesting for the grownups who have to repeatedly endure it ... even if only in the background.  For example, Bert keeps interrupting the movie ... panicking that there's not going to be a happy ending.  Ernie assures him there will be ... 'who would want to see a movie with a sad ending?'  And Bert starts on a litany ...' Titanic had a sad ending.  Dr. Zhivago ...' etc. etc.  The music is catchy without being annoying.  And, of course, Mandy Pantinkin is extraordinarily talented and fun to watch as the evil, greedy Huxley ... a sort of Grouchland version of Donald Trump.  The only downside is that my daughter now loves to make the 'thbbbbbth' raspberry sound Vanessa Williams' queen of trash makes (and has Elmo make 100 times) in the most embarrassing of situations.  It was hysterical at home but a little less so when out in public.

It must have been too realistic for him, with Elmo's character being fleshed out a little more than on his show segments. There is also a plot with this, whereas the show simply introduces various simple concepts. Now he will sit and watch the entire movie, which runs barely more than an hour. His favorite part (who knows why) is Big Bird getting stuck in the trash can. This has little or nothing to do with the plot, though it serves to illustrate how well the folks at Sesame Street understand the mind of a child. I really have no qualms about letting my children watch Sesame Street because I know they are in very capable hands. There are learning lessons throughout, presented with the usual Sesame Street flair. The movie is also fairly entertaining for adults, with some decent songs.

My son was frightened by many scenes, including ones where the villain stole Elmo's blanket, mocked him, locked him in a dark cave, etc., for what would have been almost an hour of scary, unfunny storyline if I hadn't fast-forwarded to the end.

I think the editors realized the issue, because they have Bert and Ernie as ""audience"" interrupt multiple times to say not to worry, that Elmo is going to be OK... which did not work at all with my son.

Granted, I know every word to the songs and the script, but it is worth it to see my son so happy that elmo is talking and singing so much. Elmo's world every morning on PBS is just not enough Elmo time for him. :) I just wish Elmo would make another full-length feature film.",1099094400,3,549,3.9107142857142856

At this point he broke out into tears - He's only 17 months... but I would guess many children could react this way.  I had to fast forward the movie to the part where Elmo got his blanket back before he stopped crying.

We soon found out that Grandma wasted her money...BIG TIME.  The movie is a bit strange to say the least, and a little on the psychadelic side.  The most disturbing part is when the ""evil"" character arrives in Grouchland via helicopter.  This is when my son BEGS me to turn it off and says ""It scares me, mommy."" (while covering his ears)  It didn't take us long to figure out that this was not the video for him!!  It was heartbreaking when I saw the fear in his little face.

Elmo's blankie happened to look exactly like my son's and we had to locate his blankie and make sure it was okay.  Once he was calmed down I continued the movie.

25067,5,0767839277,"Never let it be said that I've forgotten the way to Sesame Street.  It had been quite a while since my last visit, but it was great to see all of the familiar faces again: Bert & Ernie, The Count, Grover, Oscar, Big Bird, etc.  I was rather surprised to see that some of the human actors I remember are still Sesame Street regulars, as well.  Then there's Elmo.  Up until now, I only knew Elmo from all the commercials for Elmo-related products, so it was good to finally see just what all the fuss has been about.  He's a cool little monster, and it's easy to see how he has become so popular with the youngsters; I especially love the way he always refers to himself in the third person.  I also was gratified to find out just what lies inside and beneath Oscar's garbage can after all these years.  Throw in some music and dancing as well as a couple of notable guest appearances, and you've got yourself a movie I really enjoyed.
Elmo really loves his blanket, and he could never bear to part with it.  He loves it so much that he doesn't want to share it, even for a few minutes, with one of his little friends.  About this time, a series of humorous mishaps occur to land Blanket (it's essentially a character rather than an object) inside Oscar's garbage can.  Elmo dives it to get it, only to be transported (along with Blanket) to Grouchland.  This is a strange new world for Elmo, a place where you aren't supposed to ask for help or be kind to others.  Elmo's beloved blanket ends up in the hands of the mean and greedy Huxley (Mandy Patinkin), a man who lives by the creed ""Whatever I touch is mine.""  In order to get to Huxley's house and reclaim what is his, Elmo must overcome a number of challenges placed in his way and must even pass the ultimate challenge of the Queen of Garbage (Vanessa Williams).  There is of course a message to the whole story, with children (and adults) seeing why it is important to share what you have rather than be greedy.
I'm not sure I would have wanted to see The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland at the theatre, but youngsters would surely have loved such an experience.  Elmo asks the audience for help on several occasions, so parents should be prepared for having their kids yell out helpful words and sounds from time to time (FYI - I wouldn't recommend sitting directly in front of your children during the Queen of Trash sequence).  Parents also shouldn't worry too much about children becoming too upset over Elmo's misfortunes.  Whenever things start to look bad, Bert comes out and has the movie stopped and Ernie explains to him that there's still time for a happy ending.
I have to say I really loved this movie.  It is funny, the musical scenes are quite good, and I can't get enough of seeing Elmo getting down with his bad self.  This movie has everything that makes Sesame Street so great, and now I'm wishing I would have bought the DVD instead of just renting it.",1073779200,13,2930,4.412639405204461

This video is a single aphorism stretched out to movie length.  Although I liked some performances (Joey Mazzarino as the bug,) and some songs (the STOMP - inspired song at the laundromat) the big picture was completely ignored in this video.

However, I do love Sesame Street and have enjoyed just about everything I have ever seen that featured the Muppets. So, I watched THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND with an open mind full of trepidation.
I was rather surprised. Elmo didn't seem as annoying as he usually is. The movie was fun and though meant for children, contained several points of humor for parents and other adults (the Sesame Street gang is largely a group of Muppets after all). There was a nice moral and the guest peformances of Mandy Patinkin as the evil Huxley and Vanessa Villiams as the Queen of Trash were rather enjoyable and added a touch of class (another Muppet trait) to the movie. I especially liked the breaks in the film by Bert and Ernie that may help ease the youngest child's fears, but also provide some great comic relief for nostalgic adults.

But it is hard to believe (at least for me) that this show has been on the air since 1969 and usulay shows depening on if you they are a hit or not are on the air for at least 5 or more airs and may run for at least another season. When this movie begins, Elmo (Kevin Clash) is playing with this blanket until his best friend Zoe (Fran Brill) get in a fight with tle blanket and the blanket goes down Oscar's trash can and into Grouchland. And Elmo decides to get into Oscar's (Caroll Spinley who also voices Big Bird) trash can to save his blanket.
